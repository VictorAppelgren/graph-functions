  "title": "I tested out the Bosgame M5 AI - and it takes your expectations about what a mini PC can do and detonates them just for fun",
  "description": "The Ryzen processor in this mini PC eats Core Ultra 200s for breakfast",
  "content": "Unless you hate its appearance, this is the mini system to have. It provides unprecedented levels of CPU and GPU performance that make most desktop systems blush. If you have demanding tasks, this is the mini system to get. It's that simple.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nWith its advanced AI capabilities and sleek design, the Bosgame M5 AI perched eagle-like to redefine the standards of performance and versatility in the market.\n\nOne of the first mini systems we've seen using the new AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor, which breaks new ground in processing power and integrated video performance.\n\nThe silicon used here is a significant leap forward, as it enables the device to expand into markets that were previously exclusive to desktop PCs. Professionals, gamers, and tech enthusiasts can now enjoy the same level of performance and power on the go, without being tethered to a bulky desktop setup. This portability does not come at the expense of performance, as the Bosgame M5 AI is equipped with cutting-edge hardware that ensures seamless multitasking, fast processing speeds, and exceptional graphics capabilities.\n\nWhen compared to other products in this sector, the Bosgame M5 AI stands out for several reasons. Firstly, its AI capabilities are unparalleled. The device is designed to learn and adapt to the user's preferences and habits, making it more intuitive and user-friendly over time. This level of personalisation is not commonly found in other products, giving the Bosgame M5 AI a distinct edge.\n\nSecondly, the Bosgame M5 AI boasts a sleek and modern design that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Its compact size makes it easy to carry around, while its robust build ensures durability.\n\nIn terms of performance, the Bosgame M5 AI is a powerhouse. It is equipped with the latest processors, ample RAM, and high-speed storage options, making it capable of handling even the most demanding tasks with ease. Whether you are editing videos, playing graphics-intensive games, or running complex simulations, the Bosgame M5 AI delivers top-notch performance consistently.\n\nMoreover, the Bosgame M5 AI is designed with the future in mind. It supports the latest connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 7 and USB4, ensuring that it remains compatible with emerging technologies. This forward-thinking approach sets it apart from other products that may become obsolete as technology evolves.\n\nAs you might expect for a machine on its own level, this isn't a budget option, but it isn't costly either.\n\nWith its unique combination of compact design, expandability and power, the Bosgame M5 AI is obviously one of the best mini PC machines available. Still, other makers are already progressing their plans with this platform.\n\u2022 How much does it cost? From $1490/\u00a31105\n\u2022 When is it out? Out now\n\u2022 Where can you get it? Direct from the makers\n\nThe Bosgame M5 AI Mini Desktop is available in various regions via the maker's website, with two basic SKUs that are differentiated only by the amount of RAM.\n\nThe cheapest option has 96GB of RAM and 2TB of storage, priced at $ 1,489.14, while its 128GB counterpart, also with 2TB of storage, costs $1,699.76 in the USA.\n\nThe UK prices for those two options are \u00a31,103 and \u00a31,259. And in the EU, \u20ac 1,277.65 and \u20ac 1,458.35 are the asking prices.\n\nThat makes this one of the most expensive mini PC systems we've covered at TechRadar Pro, but cutting-edge technology often carries a premium.\n\nHowever, this isn't the only system using this platform. GMKtec has its EVO-X2 design, and Beelink has the GTR9 Pro.\n\nThe GMKtec EVO-X2 with 128GB and 2TB is $1999, and the Beelink GTR9 Pro of the same spec is $1985. In comparison, that makes the Bosgame M5 AI something of a bargain.\n\nAnd, those two alternative products aren't shipping yet, both being on pre-order.\n\nWe can only hope that with more competition, AI Max+ 395 systems drop to around $1500 in the next few months.\n\nThe Bosgame M5 AI isn't a NUC-sized mini system, or even close.\n\nIt's a slightly curious 200mm square 50mm thick sandwich with an aluminium case that's silver on the top and bottom and black in the middle.\n\nAngling on the corners gives it a games console vibe, and it comes with a foot that enables the machine to be placed vertically. Feet on the underside also allow it to go flat, but Bosgame didn't make any VESA mounting for it to be attached to a monitor.\n\nThe metal walls have numerous slots in them, indicating that cooling was a concern of the designers, and fans pump air through them to help keep temperatures within reasonable limits.\n\nThe front has the standard USB ports, with one USB4 and two USB 3.2 Gen 2, an audio jack, power button, SD card 4.0 reader and a performance button.\n\nPressing the performance button cycles through three modes with a colour graphic on the screen to show which one you are in. The green flower icon shows the machine is set to silent, the amber icon shows that performance and noise are in balance, and there is a red performance mode that I used for benchmarking.\n\nInterestingly, it hardly made a sound in balanced mode, and even in performance mode, it wasn't exceptionally audible until the system was heavily benchmark-stressed.\n\nOn the rear is another USB4, another USB 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, a second audio jack and a single 2.5GbE LAN port. On such a powerful machine, a 10GbE LAN port might have been expected, but you could always add one of those using one of the USB4 ports.\n\nBy subverting the USB4 ports and using both the HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, it is possible to drive four monitors from this system.\n\nMost mini systems these days disassemble for internal access, but the construction of this one makes that a much less desirable exercise. To avoid users dismantling it, Bosgame engineered an access panel on the underside.\n\nRemoving a single tiny screw will open this panel, revealing the two full-sized M.2 slots, one being occupied by a 2TB Kingston drive pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro.\n\nThere are no memory slots, as the 8000MHz DDR5 used in this system is soldered to the mainboard, which is something to consider when you choose a 96GB or 128GB model.\n\nThe only other external feature of note is a touch-sensitive button on the top that activates an RGB lighting system for the front facia. Conveniently for business users, this is off by default, but if you want some colourful lighting, it is merely a touch away.\n\nOverall, the designers of this machine tried to be different without alienating the potential customer base, and generally succeeded.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is a powerhouse designed to meet the demands of modern computing, particularly in the realms of AI, gaming, and professional workloads. It boasts 16 cores and 32 threads, has a standard clock speed of 3GHz, but can turbo boost up to 5.1GHz. The high core and thread count make it ideal for multitasking, running complex simulations, and handling large datasets.\n\nThe Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is not just about raw power; it also integrates advanced AI capabilities, making it a perfect choice for developers and researchers working on machine learning and AI projects.\n\nWhen you compare this to the best Intel is offering with the Core Ultra 200 series, there is no point of intersection. With the Arrow Lake-H generation, Intel offers sixteen cores and threads, whereas AMD's sixteen Zen 5 cores can process thirty-two threads simultaneously. But, whereas Intel has only six performance cores, the rest are for efficiency, all of the AMD cores can be performance.\n\nIt's worth noting that these are both mobile chips meant for laptop use, but the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 seems much better suited to the less power-limited environment of a mini PC.\n\nWhen it comes to memory technology, the Bosgame M5 AI Mini PC does not disappoint. It supports up to 128GB of LPDDR5X RAM, clocked at an impressive 8000MHz. LPDDR5X technology is known for its low power consumption and high efficiency, making it perfect for a compact system like the M5. The memory is dynamically shared with the GPU, enhancing both multitasking and graphics performance with increased bandwidth.\n\nThe integrated Radeon 8060S GPU is, for this reviewer, the standout feature of the Bosgame M5 AI Mini PC. Based on AMD's RDNA 3.5 architecture, this GPU comes with 40 compute units and delivers performance comparable to an RTX 4060 mobile variant.\n\nThis makes it capable of handling next-gen gaming and high-end graphics tasks. The Radeon 8060S is designed to provide smooth visuals and powerful computing without the need for a dedicated GPU. This is particularly beneficial for users who need a compact system without compromising on graphics performance. The GPU also supports advanced AI workloads, making it a versatile choice for both gaming and professional applications.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the latest Intel chips I've tested, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H and Arc 140T GPU, are rated at 99 peak TOPS, with the NPU offering 48 TOPS. This falls dramatically short of the 126 TOPS that the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 can muster. While the AMD NPU is only 50 TOPS, as an AI platform, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is head and shoulders above its Intel counterpart.\n\nOverall, the Bosgame M5 AI Mini PC is a compact yet powerful system that excels in processor performance, memory technology, and GPU capabilities. Whether you are a developer, gamer, or professional, this mini PC offers the performance and versatility you need to tackle any task.\n\nBuckle up, Intel fans, because things are going to get bumpy on this ride.\n\nFor this comparison, I matched the Bosgame M5 AI against one of the best Intel designs, the GMKtec EVO-T1. The EVO-T1 is around $1000 with 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage, making it a more affordable option. However, we're testing performance in this section.\n\nTo be brutally honest, there is only one single benchmark where the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H traded positively against the AMD Ryzen AI 395 Max, and that was single-core performance on CineBench24.\n\nEvery other score is a win for AMD, and some of these victories should worry Intel severely.\n\nGMKtec did put a better NVMe drive in their system, but I could put a much better one in and fix that score easily.\n\nThe truly crushing defeats come in anything that's graphics-related, since the Radeon 8060S is between triple and quadruple the performance of the Intel Arc Graphics 140T. Being able to compete with the mobile version of the RX4060 is genuinely impressive and moves integrated graphics as a whole to an entirely new level.\n\nWhile I didn't put the data here, this is the first integrated set that I've tested that could run the 3Dmark raytracing tests, Solar Bay and Port Royal.\n\nBut what was most disturbing was that I compared it to the system I use to write. That's an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X desktop system with 32GB of DDR4 and an AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT.\n\nThe M5 obliterated that desktop system, achieving just 8134 on 3Dmark Steel Nomad Lite, compared to 11201 on the M5. And, it wasn't much noisier doing that, even with liquid cooling.\n\nTherefore, I'd probably get more done if I ditched my PC and got an M5.\n\nBut what left me dumbstruck was discovering that the M5 is faster than the Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Tower I reviewed a while ago, and that's sold as a Workstation! OK, you could add a high-spec discrete CPU to the Lenovo, and it would be quicker, but with its RTX A2000 12GB graphics card, it gets royally trounced by the Bosgame system.\n\nIf power consumption is essential to you, I conducted some basic tests using the 3DMark Steel Nomad Lite bench as the running application. In Silent mode, it consumed about 86W. In Balanced mode, the power increased to 127W, and Performance mode required about 175W. When at idle, the machine took only 50-60W.\n\nAdmittedly, that\u2019s more than a typical NUC system, but then this machine gets much more done than a machine that only uses 45W maximum.\n\nIt appears that we've blindly stumbled over a significant moment in computing development, where the desktop system is revealed to be a paper-tiger, and the future belongs to much smaller installations.\n\nIn whatever way some might wish to view these developments, the M5 AI is a beast of a system, irrespective of physical size.\n\nI've been complaining about AMD's failure to deliver its proper RX technology to its integrated GPUs for some time, as the 680M, 780M, and 880M didn't trace a parabolic curve of performance improvements.\n\nThe Radeon 8060S is what I'd been asking for, or more than I thought AMD would provide.\n\nWhen combined with the Zen 5 architecture of the AMD Ryzen AI 395 Max, the M5 AI creates a performance level that makes even recent desktop systems look poor in comparison.\n\nWhat Bosgame has delivered is a no-compromise mini system that can be used for CAD, video editing, AI local models, and virtually any other application. Using it for Office applications is probably beneath it, but it can sling a few cycles in that direction.\n\nAs for the rest of this system, I'm not a massive fan of the aesthetics, but it's not weirdly unpleasant either. It has enough USB4 to work with a docking station nicely, and enough USB to connect most things. A second LAN port would have been nice, but with USB4 ports available, it's not a show stopper.\n\nShould it have had OCulink? Maybe. But the onboard GPU will be good enough for many people, so it's not a necessity.\n\nAt this point, the M5 AI is the breaking edge of a wave that will be rapidly followed by a veritable tsunami of Ryzen AI machines, tearing up the fabric of space and time as we've come to understand it.\n\nThose selling Intel mini systems need to be mindful of the coming storm, because not many people are going to want Core Ultra 200 series hardware once they've seen one of these in action.\n\nFor more professional hardware, we've reviewed the best business computers and the best business laptops for working on the go.",

We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best business computer overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nApple's newest iMac, with the zippy M4 chip, is the best overall business desktop PC and all-in-one device on the market. There are countless improvements on the original M1 machine, and this reasonably priced desktop PC benefits from the latest hardware and a RAM boost, with the base model starting with a healthy 16 GB unified memory. While there are no major design changes to report, this machine also comes in plenty of fun colors \u2013 giving you a bit of flair to your home office setup.\nThis model features the same stunning 4.5K panel that was fitted into its predecessor, but the downside once again is that you can only opt for a 24-inch size, rather than the 21.5-inch and 27-inch models that were previously available when Intel supplied Apple with processors. That said, it's fantastic and razor sharp at a 4,480 x 5,250 resolution (218 pixels per inch). It's great for general day-to-day usage, as well as streaming movies or TV shows, or working with media files. The iMac is also complemented with a crisp built-in webcam that's got a higher megapixel count and Center Stage functionality to keep you in the shot at all times.\nElsewhere, there are a few more quality of life improvements like the Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard finally getting USB-C (although the port still lives at the bottom of the mouse), while there are also four USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 in the higher-end edition. We'd love to have seen a bit more, including HDMI, but you could always buy expansion hardware to accommodate any additional requirements. Overall, it's the best business computer on the market, offering a near-perfect blend of performance, aesthetics, and user-friendly design.\nRead our full Apple iMac 24-inch (M4) review.\nThe best budget business computer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor such a small form factor, the Dell Optiplex Micro Plus 7020 offers an impressive desktop option for businesses and professionals who are short on space. The optional mounting brackets make it very suitable for a variety of spaces, including under desks and on the back of rolling carts, and it can be barely noticeable, under the right circumstances. This machine, ultimately, offers a great basic experience for most people hoping to work efficiently and quickly on simple office tasks.\nThe cheapest version is available for under $700, but you can easily spec it up and get some of the best hardware in a configuration in excess of $1,500 \u2013 but it depends on your specific needs. Using the machine is simple and you barely run into any problems if you're working in basic office applications like word processing or spreadsheets, and can handle a fair few browser tabs as well. What we'd recommend against is heavy video playback or any high-intensity graphics work, like video editing or advanced photo editing.\nWe also lamented the lack of HDMI and minimal USB-C, which means it limits you if you need to work with multiple peripherals at once. But that's the drawback in picking such a light and compact mini PC. Overall, this is a fantastic proposition for business users who only want a simple machine to perform day-to-day tasks and one that can be fitted subtly in an otherwise busy environment.\nRead our full Dell Optiplex Micro Plus 7020 mini PC review\nThe best desktop tower PC for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLike the Millennium Falcon and your very first car, the Dell Tower Plus Desktop might not look like much \u2013 and it might have a clunky name \u2013 but it's what you find under the hood that counts, and what it can unlock for you in your office.\nWe previously highlighted the Dell XPS Desktop as the best desktop tower PC for businesses, and this new machine replaces it in Dell's lineup. We wrote in our Dell XPS Desktop review that it offer's a huge amount of power and plenty of ports \u2013 as well as a great cooling system that keeps it quiet. The Dell Tower Plus Desktop picks up where the XPS Desktop left off \u2013 with a similar design as well as more ports than you can count on both your hands.\nThe best part is you benefit from the latest hardware in the form of an Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPU and a whopping 32GB RAM, which will be enough to handle almost everything you throw at it. The base configuration also represents fantastic value for money, provided that you aren't looking to spin up and graphics-heavy tasks or engage in visuals primarily (you can upgrade the unit to one that includes a dedicated GPU, but you'll bump the cost up significantly).\nUltimately, with a clean and professional design, as well as plenty of firepower under the hood at an affordable price, the Dell Tower Plus Desktop can fit into any office or home office.\nThe best Windows all-in-one business computer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nApple has stepped away from big-screen desktop all-in-ones in recent years, offering just a 24-inch iMac in its lineup. That's where manufacturers like HP have stepped in to fill the gap with the likes of the excellent HP OmniStudio X 31.5.\nThis all-in-one PC is a capable machine that comes with a stunning 32-inch 4K IPS display and an array of great components, including a dedicated Nvidia graphics chip. That's why the OmniStudio X 31.5 is a decent iMac replacement for those who need to work with a much larger screen in their all-in-one.\nThere's so much to love about this PC's design, with its Meteor Silver colorway blending an aluminum material for the base and neck with hard plastic on the actual all-in-one itself. The display also boasts incredibly thin bezels on the top, left and right, with a bigger one below to show the HP logo.\nIt looks exceptionally sleek, overall, but it also performs fantastically. The PC can handle pretty much anything you throw at it in terms of creative software and day-to-day performance. Its webcam capabilities are also great \u2013 and video playback is an absolute charm.\nRead our full HP OmniStudio X 31.5 review\nThe best mini PC for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGood things come in small packages \u2013 and in Apple's case, the best Mac is its smallest. This compact and lightweight mini PC packs a major punch thanks to the new M4 chip, which now features across Apple's entire computing lineup.\nWith this Mac Mini, you also get a healthy 16GB unified memory as well as a 256GB SSD in the base configuration, which is available for an audaciously low price when you look at the wider market. Not only is this the best mini PC, but it could also be the one that represents the best value for money on the market.\nOne of the best things about the newer Mac Mini is its redesign. It's sleek, beautifully designed, and much smaller than it ever has been. This makes placing it in any room in your home or in the office as simple as ever.\nThis machine also runs quietly while guaranteeing excellent performance thanks to the internal components, which are as good as you'll find in a MacBook Air or base MacBook Pro. The Mac Mini is highly functional, too, with two front-facing USB-C ports alongside an array of ports on the rear, including HDMI, Ethernet, and Thunderbolt 4 ports. This is in addition to a small power supply port.\nUltimately, it's an incredibly well-made and wel-priced Mac that benefits from being small enough to move around at your discretion, or hide away subtly in your home office. Although given how good it looks \u2013 you'd want to display it with pride.\nRead our full Apple Mac Mini (M4) review\nThe best business computer for creatives\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe HP Envy 34 all-in-one computer is undeniably powerful, offering an excellent iMac alternative to Windows users who want outstanding design, fantastic features, and great performance for a relatively affordable price. Our coveted five-star rating is rarely given, which should speak volumes about how impressive it is. That's despite the fact that it runs a last-gen Intel processor and a mobile GPU.\nAmong the many things we appreciate here are its movable 16MP webcam and excellent selection of ports. On test, however, it's its stunner of a display that hogs the spotlight. This height-adjustable, 34-inch, 5K 21:9 screen isn't just gorgeous; it's also bright with 500 nits of brightness and 98% coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut, which makes it ideal for video editors that work in that color space.\nDon't like upgrading to a new computer every couple of years? It's also expandable up to 4TB M.2 storage and 128GB DDR4 RAM so there's room to grow here.\nRead our in-depth HP Envy 34 All-in-One review\nFind the best deals on HP products with our HP coupon codes.\nThe best business computer: FAQs\nWhat computer is best for business?\nA recent development in the desktop PC world has been a modest diversification of the system case. The typical business PC comes in a mini-tower box, probably best suited under or beside your desk.\nBut a smaller case would be a better choice if space is at a premium. Dell, for example, delivers its Optiplex models in the mini tower, 'thin' desktop, and 'compact' small form factor sizes, each offering the same computing power but in a different case.\nThree other formats that have grown in popularity are:\n1. All-in-one, or AIO, combines the monitor with the base unit. The move to power-efficient components, the falling price of LCD panels, and the ubiquity of touch functionality make AIO an increasingly popular choice for businesses. The all-in-one PC resembles a slightly larger than normal LCD display containing the processor, hard drive, and memory built into the screen casing. The end result is a very elegant, clutter-free desktop PC.\n2. Ultra-small form factors, known as nettops or mini PCs, borrow many of their designs (and components) from laptops. They are laptops without a screen, input peripherals, and battery.\n3. HDMI dongles inspired by tablets and smartphones often share parts with the latter. These are usually used for display signage or in niche markets. They are usually not powerful enough for most tasks, but things will likely improve with the expansion of Thunderbolt technology.\nWhat is the difference between workstation vs desktop PC?\n\u2022 TechRadarPro Q&A with Anu Herranen, Director of New Product Introduction, Advanced Compute and Solutions at HP Inc.\nThe main thing here is that you must ignore the form factors. In this case, the question would be, what is the difference between a (regular) desktop PC and a desktop workstation? The answer is that the workstation has been developed for a specific professional workflow.\nIt is not just about the raw performance of a device's processor or other components. It is about how well they perform in specific tasks relevant to the work they are designed to do. Do they make that system easier and faster and remove unnecessary complexity so you can focus on the task and be more productive and creative?\nUsually, data scientists will not emphasize the color accuracy of a display. Still, they will care about having a device that can process huge data sets for hours without crashing mid-way. A graphic designer or VR developer, on the other hand, will care about processing jobs quicker by managing how power is split between the CPU and GPU, depending on the task.\nYou also need to get beyond the box. What software stack or operating system does the workstation need to run? Does the workstation need to run the full Adobe creative suite? Are the keyboard and other input devices optimized for the user's needs? Examples might include a VR headset or a set of separate programmable keys.\nSecurity and manageability in workstations are also designed to work seamlessly across the whole stack and conform to specific requirements defined by role and managed by IT departments. Devices are often configured to get the best out of a given software. They may even carry certifications that guarantee performance for certain software, such as those from Autodesk.\nAll of this adds up to a curated experience \u2013 a device dedicated in every way to a workflow and ready to go out of the box, saving days of configuration time.\nThe final key difference is that workstations are very expandable \u2013 designed with upgrading in mind. Whilst that is true of many PCs, workstations are engineered with this capability in mind. A workstation is designed to be a device that can expand with your needs over a long period of time.\nHow much RAM do I need for a business computer?\nYou can pick up plenty of desktop PCs and business computers with 8GB RAM \u2013 this will have once been enough, but you really need a minimum of 16GB RAM to work efficiently and effectively without any delays and bottlenecks.\nApplications are more demanding now than they've ever been, and even web browsing with multiple tabs consumes a significant amount of RAM, meaning if you're runnning with only 8GB, you might not be able to do much else without some major lag or hitting a performance wall. Ultimately, 16GB is enough for most day-to-day uses and, in Apple's case, its 16GB unified memory is plenty to even handle moderately intense tasks.\nIn Windows PCs, you ideally want 32GB if you're using intensive applications like Adobe software (Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro) or plan on doing multiple high-intensity tasks at once. Obviously, 32GB might set you back more in terms of cost, depending on the model and configuration, but you should target no less if you have more intensive needs.\nHow to choose the best business computer for you\nWhen choosing the best business computers for yourself, start by assessing the nature of your business, the number of computers you need, and the operating system.\nIf your work primarily involves using office apps, emails, web browsing, or data entry, an entry-level business PC should work perfectly well. If you're in architecture, graphic design, or any other field that demands the use of resource-intensive apps, then you'll want to opt for powerful computers with impressive graphic capabilities. We've reviewed the best photo editing PCs and best video editing PCs for professional content creation.\nHow much RAM you need will depend on how resource-heavy the apps you use are and whether you do a lot of multitasking. The more apps you run simultaneously, the more RAM you'll want for a smoother experience.\nYou'll want to evaluate what operating system works best for you. If your employees are used to working on Windows, sticking to that is more efficient than switching to a new system.\nConsider the size of the machines if you don't have a lot of desk space or want a neat workplace setup. You'll also want to consider the pricing of the computers and whether the seller offers discounts on bulk purchases.\nHow we test the best business computers\nOur team has gone hands-on with everything from the best business tablets and best business monitors to the best mini PCs to find out which business devices offer a genuine productivity boost. To test the best business computers, we first looked at their specifications, like the CPU, graphics, RAM, storage, connectivity, and dimensions. We considered the types and sizes of businesses they'd be suitable for and whether the tech configurations were expendable.\nWe assessed how well they handled multiple apps simultaneously, how smoothly they ran resource-heavy apps, and how easy the setup process was.\nWe evaluated the dimensions and weight of the computers to check whether they take up a lot of desk space and are light enough to be moved around easily. We also considered whether the computers had dual monitor capabilities, ports for external displays and swift wireless connectivity.\nWe tested out the best MacBook Pro laptops for when you need to get work done\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\n- Bryce HylandContributor\n- Collin Probst\n- Desire AthowManaging Editor, TechRadar Pro"

For every kind of business tasks, there's no beating this mobile workstation. However, I strongly recommend the Dell XPS 14, which is one of the best laptop computers around, and the Lenovo ThinkPad T14, which has one of the best keyboards you can get on any device.\nEvery work laptop in this guide has been extensively tested and reviewed by me and my team. These tests include running a range of office software, browsing and checking emails, taking a multitude of video calls, and conducting battery life tests for those who need to stay productive all day on the go.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nThis remarkable workstation has outstanding performance, impeccable build quality, and enterprise-grade features, making it the obvious top pick for demanding professionals.\nBest on a budget\nIt might not be the most powerful, but this budget laptop is ideal for business users looking for an affordable, highly capable machine that features everything everyday users will need.\nBest MacBook\nThis is a compact powerhouse with exceptional performance, seamless macOS integration, and a stunning display, making it ideal for professionals on the go.\nBest ThinkPad\nAll ThinkPads are great for business use, but I especially like the T-series line-up for general business use. The T14 is a prime example, and boasts one of the best keyboards on any laptop period.\nBest Dell\nThis is a stunning laptop for work and play - a true MacBook Pro alternative wrapped up in a beautiful, robust shell and with impressive performance across the board.\nBest HP\nAn excellent all-rounder, the HP EliteBook 845 G11 is well-built laptop pitched somewhere between a ThinkPad in performance and a MacBook in design, it that easily powered through all the business tasks we threw at it.\nLoad next products\nBest ultrabook\nThe latest Dell XPS 13 is an incredible and one of the top-rated ultrabooks we've reviewed. It's sleek, stylish, performance is great, and features all-day battery life too.\nBest 2-in-1\nThis ThinkPad X12 is a wonderfully capable 2-in-1 device, meaning that the keyboard can break away leaving you with a tablet that is capable of running a full Windows desktop class operating system.\nBest rugged\nThis is a rugged, durable laptop designed to withstand extreme environments while delivering reliable performance for field professionals.\nBest for creators\nThis is a large, powerful laptop with an expansive display, long battery life, and exceptional performance, making it perfect for demanding creative workflows.\nBest for enterprise\nThis is a Dell Latitude with a new name, and like the former range, the Pro 14 Premium is a good laptop for business and enterprise use, boasting some clever collaboration features and security features.\nBest business laptop overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need enterprise-grade performance: Perfect for engineering, architecture, or media.\n\u2705 You value a premium display: Excellent for creative tasks and presentations.\n\u2705 You require robust connectivity: Equipped to handle multiple peripherals seamlessly.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: This laptop is a premium investment.\n\u274c You prefer lightweight designs: Its weight might not suit frequent travelers.\n\u274c You need exceptional battery life: Moderate usage requires frequent charging.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Dell Precision 5690 is everything a business laptop should be\u2014powerful, reliable, and built for demanding professionals. Its premium price reflects its performance and capabilities, making it a standout choice for enterprise use.\nWhen it comes to the high-performance business laptops, the Dell Precision 5690 delivers in every area. It's built to handle demanding applications like 3D modeling, video editing, intense coding, and other heavy programs, all the way down to also being a phenomenal companion to knock out some emails on the go.\nAnd that promise bore out during our own tests. Using the laptop as our one and only device for several days, we experienced no issues when it came to getting down to business - from emails and spreadsheets to online browsing and project management. Alongside this, we also used it for photo and video editing, coding, and even gaming. It never broke a sweat. Our benchmarks even showed it should blast through engineering and CAD projects.\nBeyond its impressive performance, the 4K OLED display is gorgeous and an absolute dream for creative professionals, offering vivid visuals and high-color accuracy - a necessity for those in professional content creation.\nThe build quality is a great blend between robustness and being portable. It's definitely no MacBook Air or ThinkPad Carbon, but it's also not so thin that you're worried a drop onto the couch from too high might snap it. It's got a good weight to it, helping fill out the appeal of this being a workhorse you can rely on for your day to day professional computing needs. It's undoubtedly an expensive device, but this is a mobile workstation and when it comes to powering through a range of professional tasks, the Dell Precision 5690 proved flawless.\nRead our full Dell Precision 5690 review\nBest business laptop on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re looking for portability: Available in a range of sizes, the Acer Aspire 5 is perfect for commuters.\n\u2705 You want well-designed machine at a budget-friendly price: A great choice for professionals seeking value.\n\u2705 You want fair battery life: In our tests, we found the battery lasted around 6.5 hours during general use.\n\u274c You need high-end performance: Better suited for lighter workloads.\n\u274c You require extensive connectivity: You may need dongles or hubs for peripherals.\n\u274c You want a high-resolution webcam: At only 720p, the webcam does leave something to be desired.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Acer Aspire 5 is our best budget pick for a whole range of tasks - and considering the low price, we found performance was excellent, with up to an Intel i7 CPU and up to 32GB RAM to keep you working on the go.\nWe've long championed the Acer Aspire 5 for anyone looking for a cheap laptop that manages to balance a low price with good performance.\nIn terms of style, it's about as standard as a business laptop gets, and while not quite as slim-line as an ultrabook, it's relatively light (just 1.7kg), fairly robust, and ideal for on-the-go professionals.\nDuring our review, we found the keyboard was firm and comfortable for typing - always a benefit for a business laptop - while the 1080p matte-finish display was perfectly acceptable for online browsing, emails, running office apps, and the like. We tested out the base model, experiencing no problems when doing exactly that.\nAs a budget device, we did clock some areas where corners had been cut. While Acer claims the battery lasts 10 hours, it couldn't quite match that during our battery life tests, which hit 6.5 hours during general use streaming movies and running apps. We were also disappointed by the 720p webcam, which may be a deal-breaker for some professionals.\nHowever, for the price, we couldn't help but feel the Acer Aspire 5 gets the basics right.\nRead our full Acer Aspire 5 review\nBest MacBook for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need portable power: Ideal for professionals on the move.\n\u2705 You want top-notch visuals: The XDR display is perfect for creatives and media professionals.\n\u2705 You value the Apple ecosystem: Seamless integration with iPhones, iPads, and macOS.\n\u274c You prefer Windows OS: This laptop is exclusively macOS.\n\u274c You need budget-friendly options: It\u2019s a premium investment.\n\u274c You rely on legacy ports: Limited to USB-C without adapters.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) is Apple's ideal laptop for business professionals = ultra-portable and incredible powerful thanks to the M4 chip, there's a lot to love about this stylish machine.\nThe Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) is perfect for creatives and professionals needing high performance. It offers seamless macOS integration for productivity and collaboration alongside best-in-class Liquid Retina XDR display, a compact yet powerful machine formfactor, and so much more.\nWe found the M4 processor really drove this machine alongside the upgraded 16GB RAM, delivering pitch-perfect performance with no slowdowns or lag. Editing photos and 4K video was flawless, and the only limit we found here was when we tried editing 4K 120FPS footage from an iPhone 16 Pro Max. We could even game on this device without noticeable screen-tear (although it did give those fans a workout). In other words, it'll capably handle any office software, emails, and web browsing.\nOne of the main reasons we rank this as one of the best business laptops is the absolutely incredible battery life. In our tests, it lasted over 18 hours of web browsing on a single charge. For anyone who needs to stay on while on-the-go, that's impressive.\nSo, what are the downsides? Well, it's not as powerful as the M4 Pro and M4 Max models - and we wouldn't recommend upgrading if you have an M3 model, the numbers don't really justify it. But if your business supports macOS, this is the best MacBook for professionals.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) review\nBest ThinkPad laptop for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need business laptop that does it all: Portable and powerful, the T14 effortlessly handles almost all professional tasks.\n\u2705 You value a robust build: Like most modern ThinkPads, this one boasts MIL-STD-810H standards.\n\u2705 You want a top keyboard: We love ThinkPad keyboards for their design and deeper key travel, which makes writing incredibly comfortable.\n\u274c You want a bright, high-resolution display: We did find the screen is slightly dull compared to the likes of the MacBook Pro.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: This business laptop is around the $1000-mark, putting it in the mid-range bracket.\n\u274c You need an ultra-powerful device: While well-specced for business use, this isn't a mobile workstation.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Lenovo ThinkPad T14 is a true business laptop in every sense - from delivering excellent performance to its wonderfully comfortable typing experience.\nWhen it comes to choosing the best business laptop, you'll often find ThinkPads topping many lists. And for my money, the T-series line-up represents an excellent all-rounder for any professional.\nThe T14 is a powerful machine for business users - and while it's hardly a mobile workstation in this regard, it'll blast through a whole range of tasks and projects, capably handling web browsing, light photo editing, and flawlessly running all the usual office apps upon which businesses rely.\nIn our own tests, we experienced no issues in terms of performance, using the laptop for a range of business tasks. We were pleased with the port selection here, and build quality is also good - a robust machine built to MIL-STD-810H standards, making it a good pick for those on the commute. It certainly feels like it can take a knock or two.\nWhat really stands out here - and on most modern, traditionally designed ThinkPads - is the keyboard. Thanks to the ergonomic design and deep key travel compared to the likes of Dell and MacBook laptops, we found it perfectly built for long writing sessions (or short ones), and is about as close to using a separate, full-sized keyboard as you can get.\nFor a slightly slimmer but similarly built laptop, check out our Lenovo ThinkPad T14s review. And if the 14-inch screen isn't quite big enough, our ThinkPad T16 review offers an excellent alternative.\nRead our full Lenovo ThinkPad T14 review\nBest Dell business laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want one of the best devices ever made: Whether it's work or play, the XPS 14 shines as one of the best you can get, period.\n\u2705 You want exceptional performance: The new and improved new Intel Core Ultra 7 155H delivers brilliant results.\n\u2705 You want a long battery life: We clocked this one at around 10 hours use in our tests, which is impressive for a Windows laptop.\n\u274c You're on a budget: As you'd expect from Dell's premium range, it's not cheap.\n\u274c You prefer a laptop with the absolute best specs: Impressive though performance is, neither the CPU or GPU is the best around. I wouldn't call it a deal-breaker for business use, though.\n\u274c You just don't need a top-end laptop: With these specs and at this price, you might find it overkill for standard business use.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Dell XPS 14 remains one of the best laptops for business use and just about every other use, too. It capably powered through all tasks during our review, and compares favorably to the MacBook Pro if you're looking for a Windows alternative.\nWhether it's work or play, the Dell XPS 14 is. Even with the new line-up of business oriented-Dell laptops, I still don't think much can challenge this XPS model. If you don't need the workstation levels of power from Dell's Precision 5690, then this could very well be the next best thing.\nIt's beautifully designed, its chassis built from machined aluminum, and it looks and feels premium (admittedly, with the price-tag to match). Performance is similarly impressive, thanks in part to the inclusion of the excellent Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, which in our tests proved to be a capable alternative to an M3-powered MacBook Pro. Couple that with a dedicated RTX 4050 GPU and NPU on the chip for AI tasks, and you've got a pretty powerful business machine here.\nWe also ran a battery life test and while it couldn't match an M4 MacBook Pro, it lasted almost ten hours before requiring a a recharge. That's excellent for a Windows laptop, where six to eight hours tends to be the norm.\nTrue, it may not feature the very best specs available, and the cost can seriously rise when selecting higher-end configurations. But as a business laptop, it remains a phenomenal laptop for just about every user.\nRead our full Dell XPS 14 review\nBest HP business laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a well-specced business laptop: I really liked using the HP EliteBook 845 G11 for a range of business tasks, which is ploughed through with ease.\n\u2705 You want a laptop with good build quality: One of the stand-out features here is how well-made it feels in the hand.\n\u2705 You want a quiet laptop for shared workspaces: Even when I pushed it hard (in business terms at least), this laptop stayed near-silent throughout use.\n\u274c You need a cheap laptop: It's priced in the mid-range - I think it's a fair cost for what you get, but it's not the cheapest.\n\u274c You prefer the ThinkPad keyboard: While the typing experience was very good during my tests, it's not quite at the ThinkPad level for a laptop keyboard.\n\u274c You'd like a top-end screen: One of the few issues I had with the laptop was the display. It's hardly a deal-breaker to my mind, but some may prefer a brighter screen with a wider color gamut you'll get from the 2.5K model.\n\ud83d\udcbb The HP EliteBook 845 G11 proved to be a great laptop when I put it through its paces, easily tackling the full range of business tasks. The screen could be brighter, and after prolonged use, it did get a little warmer than some I've tested, but really, there's not a lot to dislike here.\nI really enjoyed my time with the HP EliteBook 845 G11 when I took it out for review. It's an exceptionally well-built and well-designed laptop that's squarely aimed at business use. Running office software, taking video calls, checking emails, it handled all this with total ease - and better still, did it in near-silence that makes it perfect for those in shared workspaces.\nEven the base configuration is ideally placed for conducting business tasks, but there are loads of configurations available to spec it better for your needs. This includes the upgradeable RAM and a wide selection of displays, from FHD right up to 2.5K that hits 100% DCI-P3 for those that need color accuracy.\nBuild quality is good, looking and feeling almost MacBook-esque, right down to the keyboard. Speaking of which, typing experience is also very pleasant - not quite up there with a ThinkPad, but still comfortable during all-day use.\nIn truth, I struggled to find much wrong with this device. The price may be higher than some would like, but I don't think the cost is outrageous, and I did notice it getting slightly warm during longer use. However, overall, there's plenty to like about HP's business-oriented laptop.\nRead our full HP EliteBook 845 G11 review\nBest business ultrabook\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You value portability: One of the lightest laptops in its class.\n\u2705 You need business-grade performance: Dell's lightweight laptop is an absolute powerhouse for its size.\n\u2705 You want an excellent screen: The XPS 13 features a gorgeous 3K OLED display that's bright and easy on the eyes.\n\u274c You need high-end graphics: Not built for intensive graphical tasks.\n\u274c You want a budget-friendly option: It\u2019s priced as a premium model.\n\u274c You need plenty of ports: As if often the way with slim and modern laptops, port selection is lacking.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Dell XPS 13 has long been a favorite of ours, and the latest model is a lightweight, reliable powerhouse ideal for high-performers and frequent travelers\nWe've been fans of the XPS 13, the smallest of Dell's professional laptop line-up, and the latest model (the Dell XPS 13 9350) continues that trend. Simply put, it's one of the best laptops for money - particularly if you prize powerhouse performance wrapped in a neat and portable package.\nThe design of the laptop is lightweight, but always felt very sturdy and robust during our tests, making it good for anyone regularly commuting or traveling. There's always some concern that ultrabooks like this mean the typing experience is hobbled. That's certainly not the case here. We found the backlit keyboard felt great during writing sessions, with a fair amount of key travel considering how thin the chassis is. Our main problem was with the business laptop's \"invisible\" trackpad - yes, it's responsive and features palm rejection, but we still found our fingers sliding beyond those unseen borders, resulting in the tapping of buttons that weren't there. We had the same complaints about the button-less touchbar resting above the keyboard.\nHowever, we liked the quad-array speakers, and 1080p webcam will be welcomed by business users taking regular online meetings. But where this laptop really shines, beyond its size and weight, is performance. During review, it delivered strong performance across the board, lapsing only in our gaming benchmarks. Even opening twenty tabs in Chrome and multi-tasking between them, the laptop suffered zero slowdown (and the way the browser eats memory, that's frankly a modern miracle). Overall, it's a powerful, quiet, and efficient powerhouse.\nRead our full Dell XPS 13 review\nBest 2-in-1 laptop for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need portability: Perfect for traveling professionals.\n\u2705 You want flexibility: Detachable design offers tablet and laptop functionality.\n\u2705 You value durability: With MIL-STD 810H standard, it's built to withstand rigorous use.\n\u274c You need a larger screen: The 12.3-inch display may feel cramped.\n\u274c You require high-end performance: Not ideal for heavy workloads like 3D rendering.\n\u274c You need extensive storage: Limited to 1TB configurations.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable Gen 2 is an ultra-portable 2-in-1 designed for professionals who need versatility and durability in a compact package.\nThe Lenovo Yoga ThinkPad X12 Gen 2 is a versatile 2-in-1 design with a detachable keyboard for the ultimate \"tablet-plus\" kind of feel. It's essentially a tablet that has a keyboard attachment, however that does not mean that it's limited, running a full desktop class of Windows OS.\nThe ThinkPad X12 Gen 2 is durable, great for notetaking and presentations on the go, it's super easy to use while out and about thanks to it's compact size, and it's overall quite fast when you use it.\nBut there are some issues with the two-in-one nature of the device. Storage is limited, we feel. And notably, we noticed the thin keyboard isn't as comfortable to use compared to traditional ThinkPads and if that's the main feature you want, check out the likes of the T14 or the slimmer ThinkPad T14s (check out the review here). As an alternative two-in-one, we're also big fans of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i (read our review here).\nHowever, if you're looking for a business-friendly tablet-meets-laptop type device, there's a lot to appreciate here, and even includes a stylus.\nRead our full Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Gen 2 review\nFind great deals on laptops with our Lenovo promo codes.\nBest rugged business laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need a rugged laptop: Designed to endure harsh environments, drops, and extreme temperatures.\n\u2705 You work in the field: Swappable parts and long battery life are perfect for mobile professionals.\n\u2705 You value durability: Built to withstand the toughest conditions while maintaining reliability.\n\u274c You prioritize portability: The 7.4 lbs weight makes it challenging for everyday travel.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: Its price point reflects its durability, not cutting-edge performance.\n\u274c You need a sleek design: This is built for utility, not aesthetics.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Panasonic Toughbook 40 is a rugged and reliable option for professionals working in extreme conditions. While its performance is average, its durability, battery life, and modular design make it an essential tool for fieldwork.\nThe Panasonic Toughbook 40 is ideal for field professionals who require a durable and rugged laptop. This isn't just for cops or firefighters, but this can be for construction crews, those doing 3D rendering and modeling on a job site, utility workers, railway engineers, heavy equipment operators, geologists, engineers, and even journalists - though not the kind that sits in a comfy ergonomic chair at a home office setup, more the kind that risks their life to get the story whatever the risk.\nOn the rugged side, we were pleased to see MIL-STD-810H and IP66 ratings, offering good protection when out in the field. In terms of performance, we were strongly impressed with this admittedly bulky business laptop. We ran all the usual office software, as well as try out 3D modeling software, and it never skipped a beat. The device also boasts a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), enhancing the laptop's AI capabilities.\nThe bright, glove-compatible touchscreen is great for outdoor use, even when it's a bit chilly, and the swappable components, such as the dual-battery setup, help ensure that you're good to go in the field even for extended periods of time.\nThe price reflects the durability aspect and the modularity. However, if you are looking for a laptop that feels like it could be thrown out of a plane and survive the drop (do not try this at home), you shouldn't be shocked that it's going to cost more than a laptop that you would get nervous setting down on a counter the wrong way.\nRead our full Panasonic Toughbook 40 review\nBest business laptop for creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need desktop-level power: Perfect for video editing, 3D rendering, and multitasking.\n\u2705 You want a large, vibrant display: The 16.2-inch screen offers ample space for creative workflows.\n\u2705 You require long-lasting battery life: Keeps you productive through long workdays.\n\u274c You prefer a lightweight device: Its size and weight may not be so great if you're a frequent traveler.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: This is a premium laptop, with a premium price.\n\u274c You don\u2019t need maximum power: Consider smaller, more affordable options for lighter workloads.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) is a dream machine for creators and multitaskers who need desktop-grade power in a portable form.\nThe MacBook Pro M4 Pro 16-inch is Apple\u2019s most powerful laptop, ideal for creative professionals who need a portable workstation that does not compromise on power. It features a large HDR display for exceptional clarity and remarkable productivity, it has dedicated desktop-grade performance with even the heaviest of creative workflows, and it's portable enough that you can take it just about anywhere in a backpack, bringing your creative projects everywhere you go.\nCompared to the older M3 Max model, we did notice a bump in numbers during our benchmark tests - although if you've got the predecessor, we wouldn't necessarily recommend upgrading just yet. The boost to performance isn't massively noticeable. In real-world tests, we were just as impressed, with the Apple machine powering through every task we threw at it, from running office apps and productivity software to high-res video and photo editing.\nImpressive all-round, then, and that goes for the battery life too - a key feature for any laptop for business professionals and on-the-go creatives. In tests, it lasted a jaw-dropping 21 hours and 32 minutes.\nWhile this laptop would work well for pretty much any task, it's wildly overkill if you are not one of the individuals who are doing a professional level creative job, if you're in intense coding or something similar. For prosumers or those who even just have a few lines of 4K video, you may want to check out the MacBook Airs too, or the cheaper chips. But, if money is no object, then this is the one you want.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) review\nBest business laptop for enterprise users\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a laptop specifically aimed at business use: Formerly known as the Latitude, the Pro 14 Premium is a business laptop through and through.\n\u2705 You want an excellent webcam: This laptop boasts Windows Hello support, IR sensor, 8MP HDR sensor, and privacy shutter.\n\u2705 You want top connectivity options: The Dell Pro 14 Premium has some of the best connectivity around, including Wi-Fi 7E for improved speeds.\n\u274c You need a cheap laptop: While not staggeringly expensive at base configuration, it's not a budget pick by any means.\n\u274c You need top build quality: As a standard business laptop, it lacks the robustness of the top-end XPS line-up.\n\u274c You need the best performance from the processor: We found CPU performance to be middling in our tests.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Dell Pro 14 Premium is part of what used to be known as the Latitude range, meaning it's fully specced for business and enterprise use. It's packed with security features, exceptional battery life, but the price feels a little steep for its overall performance.\nDell's Latitude range of laptops have long been a top pick for business and enterprise users - and the Dell Pro Premium is the new name for this range. Beyond the name-change, and some updated specs, it's effectively the same model most users will be familiar with.\nThe Dell Pro 14 Premium is a super-portable business laptop computer that to my mind is a good all-rounder in office and WFH settings. It's not the fastest I've ever seen, and it lacks the robust build quality of the excellent XPS line-up. But it does feature built-in security features, including a security slot among its port selection, and during tests, we found battery life lasted almost two full days before needing a recharge. That efficiency puts it on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite system.\nAlongside an impressive webcam set-up and Copilot support, the laptop also boasts something arguably more business devices should take advantage of: collaboration features like the optional collaboration touchpad, which displays key controls during Teams and Zoom calls.\nConsidering the \"premium\" moniker and cost, I would've like to see slightly better performance - the processor is, frankly, middling here. But for general enterprise duties, it's tough to beat a Dell.\nRead our full Dell Pro 14 Premium review\nBest business laptops: FAQs\nWhat are the best laptops for business?\nIt will depend on what sort of business tasks you're undertaking, but generally, the best Dell laptops and the best ThinkPad laptops are ideal for Windows users, while we've also reviewed the best business MacBooks and best MacBook Pro laptops for those who prefer macOS. These laptops for business users are tailored for work and are, in our experience, fast, robust, and reliable. All critical for those looking to boost productivity.\nWe've also found some - but not all - the best HP laptops are great if you're working to a budget, and many at the lower end of the range are absolutely perfect for running Microsoft Office, Google Docs, and general web browsing. Lenovo has been making an impressive push recently too.\nWhat features should I look for in a business laptop?\nWe asked Zach Noskey, Director of Portfolio Vision & Strategy at Dell Technologies, what he thought\nThere are many important features that differentiate a business laptop from a traditional consumer laptop. Specific capabilities to consider when purchasing a fleet of PCs will depend on the type of business and the role and responsibilities of employees, but below are a few broad areas to prioritize:\nCollaboration: With the growth of hybrid work, employees need the capabilities to collaborate and connect from anywhere. Business workers rely on best-in-class video and audio features for frequent conference calls. Look for a minimum FHD camera for quality picture, top firing speakers for improved sound, and Wi-Fi 6E and 5G for a variety of connectivity options.\nDesign: Workers need mobile and flexible form factors for working on-the-go. Business laptops should ideally be lightweight and small, but also include a 16:10 aspect ratio display for an optimal front of screen experience. Plus, they should be made with durable and premium materials built to last.\nPerformance: Performance is a given for maximum productivity. Choose business laptops equipped with the latest generation of processors available to run applications smoothly when multi-tasking and preserve battery life. CPU and GPU specifics, such as discrete graphics, will depend on the demands of a worker\u2019s role. Finally, look for systems with a minimum of 16GB of dual-channel memory and at least 512GB of SSD drive space.\nSecurity and support: It\u2019s not only about the end user experience. IT departments need enterprise-level hardware/firmware and software security features to prevent, detect and respond to threats wherever they occur. Plus, IT needs reliable service and support options for their fleet of PCs. Depending on the size of the business, companies might consider an all-in-one IT support option that handles all elements of hardware management, or choose a flexible offering that helps simplify deploying the latest PCs.\nWhat are the key differences between the best business laptops and laptops for home?\nWe asked Eric Ackerson, Senior Product Marketing & Brand Manager, Acer America\nThere are significant design and hardware differences between consumer and business laptops. In most cases, business models are made with more durable materials and construction to withstand the rigors of travel and toting the laptop to and from the office. This means they\u2019re typically built with more metal in the chassis as compared to plastic that\u2019s often used in consumer models. Many are MIL-STD 810H-certified with spill-resistant keyboards and touchpads to protect internal components from liquids. Shock-resistant features and semi-ruggedized designs help protect them from short drops. Business laptops focus on durability, reliability, performance and life span, which often means a long battery life and the ability to upgrade the laptop over time. Consumer laptops have more focus on style and value for today\u2019s computing needs.\nAnother key difference is in the software installed on the systems. Business laptops will come with Windows 11 Pro vs. Windows 11 Home. Windows 11 Pro has many features supporting business management and deployment, which aren\u2019t necessary for consumer computers. These laptops will typically have other manageability features built-in to aid IT departments in diagnosing, updating systems remotely and deploying to their workforce. In contrast, consumer laptops are often loaded with entertainment-focused applications for social media, gaming and digital hobbies that business workers do not need and IT departments may see as security risks. Simplifying the software pre-load for large quantities of business laptops purchased in bulk eases setup, deployment and management of these laptops.\nIn addition, Windows 11 Pro provides extra security features through hardware-based security, such as TPM 2.0, virtualization-based security (VBM) and hypervisor protected code integrity (HVCI). Software-based security adds advanced encryption, robust network and system security and intelligent safeguards, which improve over time against ever-evolving threats. Laptops designed for business may also come with sensors that detect people based on range and movement. These laptops can lock the screen when the user steps away and also blur the screen to off-angle viewing to prevent someone seeing the screen\u2019s content over a user\u2019s shoulder.\nAnother factor differentiating business models is the warranty. Consumer laptops typically have a one-year warranty, while commercial warranties may last up to three years and cover on-site service from a technician and the provision of spare parts.\nFinally, business laptops are more conservative in style and color in comparison to consumer versions, to keep a low profile and blend in commercial settings. Consumer models, particularly those designed for gaming, may come in bright colors and with multi-colored RGB keyboards.\nIn conclusion, there are significant differences between consumer and business laptops. While each type of laptop serves its purpose, it is important to consider needs and priorities before making a purchase. Whether you are looking for advanced security features or budget-friendly options, there is a laptop on the market to meet your needs.\nHow to choose the best business laptops\nFinding the best laptop for you is all about deciding what you consider most important and focusing on those needs before considering other requirements. If you work in an office, battery life might not be critical, but it might be vital for those working away from a desk.\nLaptop makers offer many devices, each aimed at a specific user and usage profile. Therefore it's essential to consider the role this system will play in the office and what it needs to support that. You should also check if your company has a preferred operating system. Both Windows and macOS are ideal for most work settings.\nHere are some of the aspects that we consider the most important.\nSpecs & performance\nThe performance available from a modern laptop can be awe-inspiring. Many more expensive models have potent processors, NVMe storage, and discrete GPUs - and if you're a creative professional, you'll want to see our guides to the best laptops for photo editing and the best laptops for video editing.\nTypically, cheap machines come with an Intel Celeron or Core i3 class processor, and they're only suitable for relatively light office tasks. Above them are devices that use the Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5, and these are the workhorses that can cope with most tasks by having lots of processing cores and multi-threaded processors. And on the top rung are the Intel Core-7 and Core-i9 mobile processors and the AMD Ryzen 7 class CPUs. These powerhouse systems can be used for very intensive tasks often allocated to desktop computers, and they can come with discrete GPU technology.\nFor integrated GPUs, the lesser machines have the old Intel UHD Graphics module, and in newer Intel chips, this has been supplanted by the Iris Xe GPU. Conversely, AMD systems have either the older Radeon Graphics or, the better Radeon 680M.\nThe discrete GPU options are usually based around either Nvidia RTX or AMD RX technology, with various performance tiers available. What's important to understand is that mobile GPUs aren't comparable to desktop equivalents. Therefore, don't expect an Nvidia RTX 3060 mobile GPU to perform like that same designation in a PCIe card for a desktop system.\nBecause of power limitations and heat generation, mobile GPUs tend to be cut down from the desktop regarding shaders, memory buses, and clock speeds.\nBattery Life\nThe extent of battery life depends on several factors, not least the battery capacity and how efficiently the system uses the stored power.\nWhile having a bigger battery is suitable for how long it will last without mains power, it tends to increase the machine's weight, and depending on the charger, it can take longer to recharge.\nOne of the downsides of more powerful processors is that they will consume more power, and the same is true for discrete GPUs over integrated, high-performance NVMe drives and exceptionally bright displays.\nHow this translates into the working life of batteries isn't easy to calculate. Still, the difference between a machine using power-saving mode with reduced screen brightness and another using performance settings with an intensive task can be substantial.\nThe better machines running standard office tasks or playing YouTube videos can last longer than ten hours, and the worst under four.\nIt is worth pointing out that the newest technology, i.e., Intel 13th Gen and AMD Ryzen 7000 processors, are much more power efficient than previous technologies. Older tech might be cheaper, but it won't last as long on battery, doing the same jobs as something with more modern silicon, as a rule.\nConnectivity\nHaving plenty of port selection is critical if you're hooking up a lot of different devices, from the best business monitors to the best office keyboards. However, This aspect is essential for those considering any of the best Ultrabooks and 2-in-1 designs especially often have limited external ports.\nThe solution to the limited port selection is to use a docking station. The very best laptop docking stations provide both port extensions and simultaneously charge a business laptop - ideal when working on-the-go.\nIn our experience, Thunderbolt is best, but the laptop must have at least one of these versatile ports to connect both power and data over a single connection. Achieving similar functionality over USB 3.2 Gen 2 USB-C is possible, but the bandwidth is less. That reduction impacts the flexibility, as the number of peripherals it can handle and the number of downstream ports is less.\nIf you can afford a machine with a Thunderbolt port(s) and a Thunderbolt docking station, then whatever other ports are on that laptop are largely unimportant.\nOne point about docking stations: they are usually rated for the watts they can deliver to an attached laptop, i.e., 65W or 83W. Some of the larger mobile workstation designs can draw up to 100W or more, and while these will charge on a docking station that can deliver 65W, it will take longer to charge fully.\nNetwork connections are often Wi-Fi, but some machines have an Ethernet adapter. However, if you have USB 3.2, a USB-to-Ethernet adapter is an inexpensive but valuable accessory.\nAs for Wi-Fi, some cheaper machines have Wi-Fi 5, but the better ones have Wi-Fi 6 or 6E. If you intend to connect over Wi-Fi, it might be helpful to know the Wi-Fi routers' technology and a specific system design to work best with them.\nSurvivability\nIt might seem an obvious thing to mention, but laptops get broken every day. They fail due to a manufacturing mistake, the owner being clumsy, unexpected vehicle accidents, and flood damage. The number of ways they can cease to be useful is a remarkably long list.\nCheaper machines tend to use an aluminum frame with plastic panels attached that aren't best suited to survive a drop or being doused with hot coffee, not least being outside in the rain. Higher-end machines tend to use more metal, making them intrinsically more likely to handle some abuse.\nBut, if you intend to work outdoors, in a wet or dusty environment, or have the skill of a lucky dip machine, then the best rugged laptops offer a robust and sturdy alternative. No machine is beyond being damaged by the creative things people do with them, but some are better suited to brush off accidents that would kill cheaper systems instantly.\nHow we test the best business laptops\n\u2705 More than 1,800 laptops, Chromebooks, and MacBooks reviewed\n\u2705 15 years of product testing\n\u2705 Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2705 Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe've tested over 18000 laptops, MacBooks, and Chromebooks suitable for work, including the best laptops for working from home, the best laptops for work and gaming, and the best laptops for teachers working in education.\nBefore we get to benchmarks and real-world testing, when reviewing the best business laptops we go through a familiarisation protocol. This is where we\u2019ll use the machine for a few days for general tasks to establish if it is all working as intended and highlight any potential issues that the designers overlooked.\nDuring this phase, we\u2019ve seen many problems, like hinges that cover up ports or trackpads unsuitable for adult-sized hands. Those issues are less common since many designs are derivatives of previous models with new motherboards rather than entirely new hardware.\nAfter testing the trackpad and keyboard, we usually remove the back of the machine to see inside the case unless we know a sticker is denying us access to the inside. In that scenario, it is usually possible to get a manual that reveals what we\u2019d see, and that is crucial for us to determine if the laptop can be user upgraded, stickers or not.\nMany of the thinner Ultrabook and 2-in-1 models are now surface mounting memory, stopping that from being upgraded by the owner. But even those tend to have an M.2 slot for the NVMe drive that allows larger enterprises to be used. For those that have run the same system for many years, it might also be helpful to see what the spec of the battery pack is for that to be potentially replaced when it becomes worn out.\nAfter we\u2019ve done that investigation and put the machine back in one piece, we begin our testing protocol, where we go through a selection of benchmarks that test different aspects of the hardware. These benchmarks include many synthetic tests like 3DMark, PCMark10, GeekBench, CineBench23, CPU-Z, CrystalDiskMark 8.04, and other real-world tools.\nThese give a good oversight on single and multi-core processing, GPU performance, NVMe speed, and battery life.\nThe battery test is part of PCMark10 that requires the screen to be dimmed to 120 nits and the performance setting of the machine put into a power-saving mode (but with the screen always active). The screen brightness is confirmed with the DataColor calibrator, and the test runs until the battery from total hits 20% of its capacity. From this test, it is possible to provide a ballpark time for how long a laptop will last without mains power.\nExactly how it performs will depend on how it is used and how demanding those tasks are. Still, the calculated time should reveal if a fully working day on battery power is possible.\nAll this data is then cross-checked with that collected from other testing sessions to establish where the machine fits into our bigger picture, specifically against other hardware that uses the same processor platform or against a previous model in the same series.\nYou can learn more about our testing process in How we test laptops and desktops: our reviewing process explained.\nFor more productivity-boosting devices, we've reviewed the best business computers and best business tablets.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSteve is B2B Editor for Creative & Hardware at TechRadar Pro.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nBigger than the typical NUC, but the ability to externally connect a full PCIe card is a game changer. Without the card dock, this is a nice system, but with the dock, it can become a mini workstation. If you want even more power, Beelink has Core Ultra options.\nPros\n- +\nPowerful platform\n- +\nDual M.2 Slots and 2.5GbE LAN ports\n- +\nEx Dock\n- +\nAffordable\nCons\n- -\nInternal access is difficult\n- -\nThe processor is mobile, not desktop\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra Mini PC review\nWe've seen several mini systems recently with an OCuLink port, which enables video cards to be connected externally. OCuLink uses Thunderbolt technology to extend the PCIe bus, but doing that offers less useable bandwidth than an x4 slot.\nThe Beelink GTi12 Ultra is aimed at the same market as those other mini systems but takes an entirely different approach that enables proper PCI cards to be connected externally.\nWith a slightly larger form factor than the standard NUC, measuring 158mm square and 55.8mm high, this design isn\u2019t meant for monitor mounting. That's still not huge, but the extra space has allowed for an internal PSU and the motherboard to support a full PCIe x8 slot.\nThe problem, as any person who has built a modern computer might realise, is that being able to physically attach a discrete desktop video card to the GTi12 Ultra is only part of the problem. More powerful video cards need additional power.\nThe Beelink resolution to that problem is the Beelink Multi-Functional EX Docking Station, an external box that the GTi12 Ultra can sit and connect to the PCIe port. This allows an external GPU to be slotted on and also powered externally. It also does other things that we'll discuss later.\nThis is a unique design, so far, and entirely sidesteps the issue of a mini system being hamstrung by GPU performance by turning it into a small desktop solution.\nThe GTi12 Ultra is the cheapest of three SKUs for the same design, and even with the GT Ultra addon, it's relatively inexpensive. However, you will need to purchase a video card to the performance level you wish, and that might cost substantially more, depending on which you want.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra: Price & availability\n- How much does it cost? From $639/\u00a3489.69/\u20ac584.96\n- When is it out? Available now\n- Where can you get it? Directly from Beelink or online retailer\nAt the time of writing, Beelink only had a single SKU of the Beelink GTi12 Ultra that came with 32GB of DDR5 memory and 1TB of storage. Available in two colours, defined as Frost Silver and Space Grey.\nTechnically, there are other options in the Beelink GTi14 Ultra product line that offer the same external GPU technology but with a choice of Intel Ultra series processors.\nThe one Beelink GTi12 Ultra model costs $639 (\u00a3489.69 or \u20ac584.96), and it's currently on pre-sale with a promise to ship within ten days.\nTo get the full experience of this hardware also requires the Beelink Multi-Functional EX Docking Station, which sells for $159(\u00a3121.85 or \u20ac145.55) from Beelink.\nIf we combine those prices, the machine and dock are just a couple of dollars short of $800, making this one of the more expensive mini systems around.\nHowever, Beelink is selling the two in a bundle for $738 (\u00a3565.56 or \u20ac675.59), making the dock only $99 more. When you consider it comes with a power supply, unlike most OCuLink docks, that's a bargain.\nThe machine is available through Amazon.com, and this reduces the price to $579, but the bundle with the dock isn't an option.\n- Value: 4 / 5\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra: Specifications\n| Item | Spec |\n|---|---|\n| CPU: | Intel Core i9-12900H(14 cores, 20 Threads) |\n| GPU: | Intel Iris Xe Graphics |\n| RAM: | 32GB DDR5-4800 (2400 MHz) (16GB x 2) Expandable to 96GB |\n| Storage: | 1TB Crucial P3 Plus |\n| Expansion: | 1x M.2 2280 PCIe Gen 4 |\n| Ports: | 1x Thunderbolt 4 port, 5x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, x HDMI, 1x DisplayPort 1.4a, 1x 3.5mm Audio Jack, 1x SD Card Slot, 1x PCIe x8 slot (x16 physically). |\n| Networking: | 2x 2.5GbE LAN, WiFi 6 (Intel AX200), Bluetooth 5.2 |\n| OS: | Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed) |\n| Base Power: | 35W-70W (configurable) |\n| PSU: | Integral 145W PSU |\n| Dimensions: | 158 x 158 x 55.8 (mm) |\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra : Design\n- Beautiful build quality\n- PCIe slot underneath\n- Nightmare upgrades\nConsidering the obvious thought that went into the outside and the specifications, the lack of joined-up thinking about users upgrading this machine was disappointing.\nThe design of the Beelink GTi12 Ultra is both a triumph and a fiasco, depending on what you intend to do with it.\nWhere it shows the engineering skills of Beelink is the quality of the construction, which is at a level even Apple might find acceptable. The top and sides are all milled from a solid piece of cast aluminium, and all the ports are either on the front or back, leaving the sides entirely clean.\nAir is drawn through many tiny holes on the plastic underside and, once heated, is ejected along the edge of the back top. Although there is so much exposed metal, some heat is also going to be radiated by the case.\nThe front has a USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, a Thunderbolt 4 Type-C port, an SD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack, although none of these are labelled in the review hardware.\nThe special feature on the front is the power button, as it includes a fingerprint sensor that is linked to Windows Hello on the system.\nThe rear has many more ports, although the 3.5mm audio jack is a duplication of the one on the front. These ports are labelled and include four more USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, plus another Type-C, dual 2.5GbE LAN ports, HDMI and DisplayPort outputs and the power inlet.\nThere is also one other hidden port that isn't on the front or back, and resides behind a rubber strip on the underside. That's a PCIe slot, though it's not made for you to invert the PC and jam a card into it but to extend the PCIe bus to the EX dock. More about that later.\nBeing bigger than a standard NUC design, the Beelink GTi12 Ultra has enough space inside for a 165W PSU. Therefore, the power inlet is a two-core cable directly to the mains power.\nSo far, this all sounds good, with only minor concerns about there only being a single Thunderbolt port.\nHowever, the elegance of this design takes a nosedive when you try to explore the possibility of an upgrade to memory or storage.\nGetting the underside off is relatively straightforward once you've removed the rubber plugs that cover the four screws and taken those off. Then you are confronted with a dust shield that requires another four screws. At this point, the memory and M.2 slots between you are the PSU and the internally mounted speakers.\nIt was at this point that I remembered that I wasn't being sponsored by iFixit, and gave up, probably another eight screws from my objective. I'd worked out that the PSU had some delicate ribbon cables attached and didn't want to damage anything.\nIn short, if you intend to upgrade this machine, and it does have an unused M.2 2280 NVMe slot waiting to be filled, then be prepared to go slowly and maybe refer to a breakdown video online to avoid disaster.\n- Design: 3.5 / 5\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra: Features\n- Intel Core i9-12900H (14 cores, 20 Threads)\n- 28 PCIe Lanes\n- Power boost\nWe've seen the Intel Core i9-12900H used in other mini PC designs before, like the Acemagic F1A, and it's one of the better Intel 12th-generation designs from the Alder Lake series.\nIt combines six P-cores, all with hyperthreading, with eight E-cores, giving up to twenty thread processing potential. However, the ratio on many multi-threaded tasks is less than 7:1, showing that the E-cores aren't wonderful at those tasks.\nThe best thing about this chip, other than its use of DDR5, is that it has 28 PCIe lanes, with PCIe 4.0 on the processor and PCIe 3.0 on the support chipset.\nIn this context, that makes it well suited for exposing the PCIe bus for the dock to access, even if that does take a significant amount of the available PCIe lanes.\nWhen you start trying to match the bandwidth of the available ports with those lanes, there is an obvious shortfall. That explains why the PCIe slot is only 8X and not X16, and it might also indicate why the machine was only given a single Thunderbolt port.\nThere are ways to make the bandwidth of PCIe more flexible by using PCIe switches, but ultimately, it can only stretch so far between competing I/O, and making it appear to be more than it is can be counterproductive.\nBeelink doesn't appear to have gone down that rabbit hole, thankfully, and while some restrictions are apparent, they're not so problematic that they slow the system down in any noticeable way.\nBecause the case is bigger, Beelink has the luxury of doubling the power limit on the Core i9-12900H, which is typically capped at 45W on most laptops that use it. Without battery power to consider and a sizeable, well-ventilated case, the power consumption has been increased to 70W, and the internal PSU still has enough extra to pass on plenty through the USB and Thunderbolt ports.\nThe extra power for the processor (and its GPU) has elevated the performance of this system by around 20%, and while that might seem modest for doubling the power consumption, it brings this system up to the level of 13th-gen Core i9-13900H in most respects.\n- Features: 4 / 5\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra: Performance\n- Great performance\n- Iris Xe graphics\n- EX Dock enhancement\n| Mini PC | Header Cell - Column 1 | Beelink GT Ultra | Acemagic F1A |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| CPU | Row 0 - Cell 1 | Intel Core i9 12900H | Intel Core i9-12900H |\n| Cores/Threads | Row 1 - Cell 1 | 14C 20T | 14C 20T |\n| RAM | Row 2 - Cell 1 | 32GB DDR5 (2x16GB) | 32GB DDR4 (2x16GB) |\n| Storage | Row 3 - Cell 1 | Crucial P3 Plus 1TB | 1TB RS1D0TSSD710 |\n| Graphics | Row 4 - Cell 1 | Iris Xe Graphics (EU96 | Iris Xe Graphics (EU96) |\n| 3DMark | WildLife | 15261 | 12610 |\n| Row 6 - Cell 0 | FireStrike | 5821 | 4944 |\n| Row 7 - Cell 0 | TimeSpy | 2028 | 1759 |\n| Row 8 - Cell 0 | Nomad Lite | 1375 | 1170 |\n| CineBench23 | Single | 1819 | 1830 |\n| Row 10 - Cell 0 | Multi | 11451 | 12494 |\n| Row 11 - Cell 0 | Ratio | 6.3 | 6.83 |\n| GeekBench 5 | Single | 1805 | 1768 |\n| Row 13 - Cell 0 | Multi | 9310 | 9657 |\n| Row 14 - Cell 0 | OpenCL | 20528 | 17365 |\n| Row 15 - Cell 0 | Vulkan | 19126 | 17157 |\n| CrystalDisk | Read MB/s | 5218 | 4786 |\n| Row 17 - Cell 0 | Write MB/s | 4751 | 4505 |\n| PCMark 10 | Office | 6067 | 6031 |\n| WEI | Row 19 - Cell 1 | 8.4 | 8.3 |\nCovering the Beelink GTi12 Ultra has been complicated, not least because changes made to the power profile of the Intel Core i9-12900H significantly impacted the processing power that this mobile chipset can deliver. In essence, Beelink successfully turned this portable CPU into a desktop one.\nTo explain this part of the story, we've put one set of benchmarks showing the Beelink GTi12 Ultra against the Acemagic F1A, a mini PC with the same CPU.\nDepending on what processing you are doing, the results range from slightly better to more than that, and the majority of the improvement is a boost in the GPU speeds.\nThis CPU has the older Iris Xe integrated GPU, not the Intel Arc seen on the Core Ultra processors.\nWhile it's important to see the raw performance in isolation, things take a significant turn when you unleash the capability of the PCIe slot and the EX dock.\nHere are some new numbers to consider, with the Beelink GTi12 Ultra being compared to another Beelink GTi12 Ultra with the EX dock and a powerful graphics card.\n| Mini PC | Header Cell - Column 1 | Beelink GT Ultra + Sapphire RX 7900 GRE | Beelink GT Ultra |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Graphics | Row 0 - Cell 1 | Sapphire RX 7900 GRE 16GB | Iris Xe Graphics (EU96) |\n| 3DMark | WildLife | 102954 | 15261 |\n| Row 2 - Cell 0 | FireStrike | 32414 | 5821 |\n| Row 3 - Cell 0 | TimeSpy | 17976 | 2028 |\n| Row 4 - Cell 0 | Nomad Lite | 20287 | 1375 |\n| GeekBench 6 | Single | 2629 | 2531 |\n| Row 6 - Cell 0 | Multi | 10684 | 10757 |\n| Row 7 - Cell 0 | OpenCL | 146143 | 16645 |\n| Row 8 - Cell 0 | Vulkan | 166028 | 20439 |\n| PCMark 10 | Office | 8295 | 6067 |\n| WEI | Row 10 - Cell 1 | 9.4 | 8.4 |\nThe video card in this test, supplied by AMD, is the relatively recent Sapphire RX 7900 GRE (Golden Rabbit Edition) with 16GB of GDDR6.\nThis card sells for around $550 and is a notch down from the RX7900 XT and XTX designs, which are AMD's most powerful GPUs. The GRE option was initially exclusive to China but has recently been released globally.\nThe numbers, as it's plain to see, are extraordinary.\nIn the 3DMark tests, the RX 7900 GRE boosts performance from more than fivefold to over fourteen times higher in the more complicated benchmarks.\nAnd, in the GeekBench OpenCL and Vulkan tests, it's more than eight times faster.\nIt should be said that with a high-end Nvidia card, like the RTX 4080 or an AMD RX 7900 XTX, these numbers would be even higher because these benchmarks are more about testing the GPU than the CPU.\nThat's a beautiful result, and it shows what investing an extra $700 on the EX dock and a decent video card can return. It's about twice the speed of a dedicated mobile workstation such as the Dell Precision 7780 and its Nvidia RTX 3500.\nBut does it make the Beelink GTi12 Ultra an alternative to a PC workstation? Maybe not.\nTo understand why it was important to put this system against a desktop workstation, like the Lenovo Thinkstation P2 Tower, a desktop system that uses the Intel Core i9-14900K and, in our tests, used the less powerful Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card.\nUsing the Blender Benchmark, the Intel Core i9-14900K scores 423.83, dramatically more than the 145.31 that the Intel Core i9 12900H delivers. Conversely, the RTX 4060 scored 3182.48, whereas the much higher specification RX 7900 GRE achieved only 2695.91.\nThis is not an apples-to-apples comparison, but it's also enough information to conclude that the mobile CPU in the Beelink machine can't push a GPU along like a powerful desktop CPU, like the 24 cores of the Intel Core i9-14900K.\nHowever, the Beelink GTi12 Ultra, combined with the EX dock and the video card we experimented with, costs around $1300, and the Lenovo Thinkstation P2 Tower with the quoted CPU and GPU was double that amount. The Dell Precision 7780 mobile workstation was more than three times the price.\nThis might not be the fastest solution, regardless of what video card technology is used, but it's still a cost-effective way to have a mini system with decent video performance and the ability to upgrade the graphics when you wish.\n- Performance: 4.5/ 5\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra : Verdict\nBefore saying anything else, we should explain that there are limits to what type of GPU this system can handle, as dictated by the EX dock.\nThe dock has an integrated 600W PSU, which is enough for most video cards since the Mini PC uses none of this power. However, the mounting for the video card is only for dual-slot designs, and some cards use three slots and won't fit. The power delivery is two PCIe 9-pin lines, although it could be made to fit other cards with power adapters.\nDepending on the card, it should be possible to put an RX 7900 XTX on this system or even an RTX 4080. But, the question that needs to be asked is whether a desktop system using an Intel Core Ultra CPU or an AMD Ryzen 9 might be a better option.\nPossibly, but it would take up much more room.\nWe didn't investigate other types of PCIe devices other than video cards with this hardware. Adding a dual or quad-port 10GbE card to this system or many other options that need an X8 PCIe slot would be possible. That's a significant advantage of using PCIe: being able to work with lots of technology, not just video cards.\nThe Beelink GTi12 Ultra is a lovely-looking Mini PC that includes most of the technology people typically want, and its price is reasonable.\nIt's a mystery why Beelink renamed this the GTi12 Ultra. Unlike the GTi14 machines, it doesn't have an Intel Core Ultra processor, and all the packaging on our review hardware called it the GT Ultra.\nWhatever that confusion is about, the idea of creating an inexpensive dock and extending PCIe through that is inspired. Well, more inspired than the engineering that buried the memory slots and the M.2 storage locations under sixteen screws, a power supply and some tinny-sounding speakers.\nIn the future, we hope that Beelink will do more machines with the PCIe slot feature because it's something its competitors haven't got yet, and it addresses the issue of GPU power in the best possible way.\nShould you buy a Beelink GTi12 Ultra?\n| Attributes | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | For the technology it uses, this isn't expensive. | 4 / 5 |\n| Design | Lovely looking system on the outside, an upgrade nightmare inside. | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Features | Lots of useful ports, including Thunderbolt, and that all-critical PCIe slot. | 4 / 5 |\n| Performance | Fastest system we've tested with this CPU, and adding the EX dock and a powerful GPU sends it into orbit. | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Overall | Innovative design that avoids OCuLink and delivers great performance for a mini PC. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want a mini with true desktop graphics\nOCuLink connection does enable external video cards to be powered by some mini PCs, but the technology isn't as elegant as the EX dock and the Beelink GTi12 Ultra.\nWhat is especially good about the Beelink GTi12 Ultra is that it is possible to buy a modest video card initially and then get something much more powerful if the need arises.\nYou want a fully featured design\nAlong with the PCIe expansion possibilities, the Beelink GTi12 Ultra has enough ports, including dual 2.5GbE LAN ports and Thunderbolt, to do almost anything.\nAnd, if you buy the EX dock, you could even add a 10GbE card using the external PCIe.\nDon't Buy it if...\nYou like to upgrade your machines\nSome Mini PC systems are very easy to upgrade, but the Beelink GTi12 Ultra isn't one of those. Getting access to the memory and the two M.2 NVMe slots involves dismantling much of the system; therefore, you will only want to do it once.\nYou want desktop PC level performance\nBeelink has done what it can with the processor in the Beelink GTi12 Ultra, but it's a mobile CPU designed for laptops. Compared with a desktop processor, it doesn't have the cores or performance of the top options.\nIt's not a bad chip, it is just not a desktop CPU.\nAlso Consider\nGeekom MegaMini G1\nThe MegaMini G1 is unlike any other SSF system you will likely encounter. Based on the Intel Core i9-13900K processor, it also has OCuLink, but it also has a discrete GPU inside with water cooling. You can't upgrade the RTX 4060 inside the case, but you can add an even more powerful GPU using the OCuLink connection.\nCheck out our Geekom MegaMini G1 revew\nGMKtec NucBox M7 Pro\nOne of the latest Mini PC designs from GMKtec, the M7 Pro retains the classic NUC scale but uses an AMD Ryzen processor and not Intel.

With 16 cores (six performance, eight efficiency, and two low-power, clocking up to 5.4GHz, it\u2019s designed to handle demanding multitasking, AI workloads, and creative applications with ease. Paired with Intel\u2019s Arc 140T GPU and a dedicated NPU, the EVO-T1 delivers up to 99 TOPS of AI acceleration \u2014 making it one of the most capable AI-ready mini PCs in its class.\nPhysically, the EVO-T1 maintains a palm-sized footprint (103 \u00d7 98 \u00d7 32 mm), yet it packs workstation-grade specs: up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM (64GB pre-installed in higher SKUs), triple PCIe Gen 4 M.2 slots supporting up to 12TB of storage, and a robust array of ports including USB4, OCuLink for external GPU support, dual 2.5GbE LAN, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and quad-display output. Its dual-fan cooling system keeps thermals in check without excessive noise, and the configurable power profile (up to 150W) allows users to balance performance and efficiency.\nWhile the barebone version offers flexibility for DIY builders, the 64GB RAM + 1TB SSD SKU provides the best value for most users, delivering plug-and-play convenience without compromising on speed or capacity. The lack of a pre-installed OS may be a minor hurdle for some, but it also gives professionals the freedom to deploy Linux, Windows, or custom environments as needed.\nThe EVO-T1 is best suited for developers, AI researchers, and creative professionals who need serious compute power in a small form factor. It\u2019s ideal for running local LLMs, training models, compiling code, editing media, or managing virtual machines. Thanks to its upgradeability and connectivity, it also serves well as a compact workstation, edge server, or even a home lab node.\nGamers may find the integrated Arc GPU limiting for AAA titles, but with OCuLink support, external GPU pairing is a possibility. Overall, the EVO-T1 is a forward-looking machine that blends performance, flexibility, and portability \u2014 perfect for users who demand more than what traditional mini PCs can offer and want the best mini PC with Intel technology.\nGMKtec EVO-T1: Price and availability\n- How much does it cost? From $899\n- When is it out? Available now\n- Where can you get it? Direct from GMKtec or via online retailers like Amazon\nThis machine can be bought directly from GMKtec for only $899 for the barebones SKU by clicking here.\nFor those in the UK/EU, you'll want to head the the company's new European store by clicking here. The barebones is \u20ac 799.99, the 1TB is \u20ac 1099.99, and the 2TB is \u20ac 1199.99.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nHowever, for a model with RAM, storage, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, the starting price is $999.99 for 64GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, with the option to upgrade to 2TB of storage for $1079.99.\nI'm seeing plenty of different configurations over on Amazon in the US and UK. That includes the 1TB model on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk. Although the $1300 / \u00a31201 price is a hefty increase for the joy of next-day delivery.\nHowever, I'd advise avoiding Amazon.co.uk, as this is a US-sourced import and the seller is asking an eye-watering \u00a32,465.11 for the top-end model. I'd recommend using GMKtec direct in this instance.\nYou can get a few dollars off by purchasing it via AliExpress, but not a huge discount.\nCurrently, there are three other mini PC designs utilising the same Ultra 9 285H platform. These include the Geekom IT15, the MinisForum M1 Pro and the Asus NUC 15 Pro+. The IT15 is roughly the same price, and the M1 Pro is only $695 for the barebones option.\nThe NUC 15 Pro+ is available in a wide range of SKUs with different Ultra processors, with models featuring the Ultra 9 starting from $1,469.99 on Amazon.com.\n- Value: 3.5 / 5\nGMKtec EVO-T1: Specs\nItem | Specification |\n|---|---|\nCPU | Intel Core Ultra 9 285H (16 cores: 6P + 8E + 2LP, up to 5.4GHz, 24MB L3 cache) |\nGPU | Intel Arc 140T (8 Xe cores, up to 2.35GHz, 77 TOPS INT8) |\nNPU | Intel AI Boost (13 TOPS INT8) |\nRAM | 64GB DDR5-5600 (32GB \u00d7 2 SO-DIMM), expandable to 128GB (up to DDR5-6400) |\nStorage | 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD (M.2 2280), expandable to 12TB via 3\u00d7 PCIe Gen 4 M.2 slots |\nExpansion | 3 \u00d7 M.2 2280 PCIe Gen 4 \u00d74 slots |\nPorts (Front) | 1 \u00d7 USB-C (USB 3.2 Gen 2, PD/DP/Data) - 3 \u00d7 USB-A (USB 3.2 Gen 2) - 1 \u00d7 3.5mm combo audio jack |\nPorts (Rear) | 1 \u00d7 HDMI 2.1 (8K@60Hz / 4K@144Hz) - 1 \u00d7 DisplayPort 1.4 - 1 \u00d7 USB4 - 1 \u00d7 Type-C - 2 \u00d7 USB 2.0 Type-A - 2 \u00d7 2.5GbE LAN - 1 \u00d7 OCuLink (PCIe Gen 4 \u00d74) - 1 \u00d7 3.5mm combo audio jack |\nNetworking | Wi-Fi 6 (AX200), Bluetooth 5.2, Dual 2.5GbE LAN |\nDisplay Output | Quad-display support via HDMI, DP, USB4, and Type-C |\nOS | Barebone (no OS pre-installed) or optional Windows 11 Pro |\nPower Supply | DC IN 19V 6.32A (120W) or 19V 7.89A (150W max) |\nAI Performance | Up to 99 TOPS (INT8) combined CPU/GPU/NPU |\nDimensions | 154 x 151 s 73.6mm |\nGMKtec EVO-T1: Design\n- Metal construction\n- Awkward access inside\n- Triple M.2 2280\nFor whatever reason, probably because this is the eleventh mini PC from GMKtec I\u2019ve reviewed, but I expected GMKtec to make the EVO-T1 entirely from plastic. Some of the case sections are, but there are also some metal case parts.\nThis gives the machine much more gravitas, as it equals or surpasses the construction quality that Intel had with its NUCs and that Asus offers today.\nThe slightly odd gold wrap on the top and left creates an attractive accent in gold to the main enclosure, which is a silk finish black. The machine is made to either lie flat or be vertically placed, and it comes with a VESA mounting plate for attaching it to a monitor.\nMeasuring 154 \u00d7 151 \u00d7 73.6 mm, this design is a bit bigger than a classic NUC, but not excessively large. Its brushed aluminium chassis feels premium and solid, with subtle venting along the sides and base to support its dual-fan cooling system.\nOne oddity is how the gold metal shroud connects to the rest of the EVO-T1, using three of the four feet that are threaded through to the underside of the case.\nThese feet need to be removed to get inside, and as they\u2019re completely smooth, this isn\u2019t easy. Once they are out, four small screws can be taken out to separate the case into two halves, with a large fan in one.\nWe\u2019ve seen cases that are much easier to get inside than this, though once past the three feet and four screws, you have full access to the dual DDR5 memory slots and the three 2280 M.2 slots. One of the M.2 slots is occupied with the supplied storage, unless you opt for the barebones option.\nOn the front panel, you\u2019ll find three USB-A ports (USB 3.2 Gen 2), a USB-C port supporting data, DisplayPort, and Power Delivery, and a 3.5mm combo audio jack. These are ideal for quick access to peripherals like external drives, headphones, or input devices. The rear panel is where the EVO-T1 truly shines: it includes a USB4 port, another Type-C connector, two USB 2.0 ports, HDMI 2.1 (supporting up to 8K@60Hz or 4K@144Hz), DisplayPort 1.4, dual 2.5GbE LAN ports, and a second 3.5mm audio jack.\nThere\u2019s also an OCuLink port, allowing users to connect an external GPU for serious graphical workloads or gaming. And, GMKtec already offers the AMD Radeon 7600M XT-- AD-GP1 External GPU Docking Station for those needing greater GPU performance.\nThe chassis is designed with modularity in mind. The top panel can be removed to access three M.2 PCIe Gen 4 slots, making upgrades straightforward. The system supports quad-display output, enabling creators to run multiple monitors for editing, coding, or trading setups. Cooling vents are strategically placed to optimise airflow without compromising the sleek silhouette.\nOverall, the EVO-T1\u2019s external design is both practical and forward-looking. It offers the kind of I/O and expandability usually reserved for much larger systems, all while maintaining a clean, understated look that fits into any workspace.\n- Design: 4.5 / 5\nGMKtec EVO-T1: Features\n- Intel Core Ultra 9 285H (16 cores, 16 Threads)\n- 28 PCIe Lanes\n- Intel Arc 140T GPU\nTThe Intel Core Ultra 200 series, particularly the Arrow Lake desktop CPUs, has drawn criticism from both enthusiasts and professionals for falling short of expectations. Marketed as a leap forward in AI acceleration, gaming performance, and energy efficiency, the series promised a flagship experience.\nBut early benchmarks and real-world usage revealed a different story. Many users found that chips like the Core Ultra 9 285K underperformed not only against AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9000 series but even against Intel\u2019s own previous-generation Raptor Lake CPUs.\nWhat Intel got right was power efficiency, but to achieve this objective, chip designers sacrificed multi-thread performance, and none of these processors have hyperthreading.\nThis is a problem from a mini PC perspective, as power management isn\u2019t the same issue the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H was designed to resolve, given there is no battery to manage.\nThe only advantage of having such a power-efficient chip inside a small PC is that it\u2019s unlikely to overheat with even a modest cooling system.\nThat said, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H features sixteen cores, allowing it to handle a decent number of tasks simultaneously, and it also has 28 PCIe lanes.\nThe lane breakdown is a single x8 Gen5 + three x4 Gen4 and eight Gen4(x1,x2,x4). That\u2019s a huge amount of bandwidth, and in this context, it allows plenty for USB ports, M.2 slots and OCuLink.\nIf this architecture has a weakness other than raw performance, it\u2019s probably the Intel Arc 140T GPU. The Intel Arc 140T integrated GPU, featured in Arrow Lake mobile processors, has struggled to meet expectations, especially when compared to AMD\u2019s latest integrated graphics.\nA significant issue here is that Intel has developed the Lunar Lake 140V GPU, which utilises second-gen XeSS cores; however, the 140T relies on the older Xe+ architecture, which limits its efficiency and gaming capabilities.\nWith AMD now rolling out the Radeon 880M and 890M, these have a superior software stack and higher GPU frequencies that give them the practical advantage in many scenarios.\nIntel has this odd notion that the same integrated GPU that is on the lowest 200 series processor is also fine for the highest, and for power users, the answer is to use OCuLink and attach a discrete GPU externally.\nThat\u2019s an option, but that increases the overall cost of the system to a point where a desktop PC might have been a more affordable choice.\nIf you don\u2019t need GPU performance, then the Intel Arc 140T GPU might not be a problem, but for those that want a more compelling experience, the latest AMD Ryzen designs and their GPUs look like a better choice.\n- Features: 4 / 5\nGMKtec EVO-T1: Performance\nMini PC | Header Cell - Column 1 | GMKtec EVO-T1 | Beelink GT Ultra (GTi12) |\n|---|---|---|---|\nCPU | Row 0 - Cell 1 | Intel Core Ultra 9 285H | Intel Core i9 12900H |\nCores/Threads | Row 1 - Cell 1 | 16C 16T | 14C 20T |\nRAM | Row 2 - Cell 1 | 64GB LPDDR5 (2x32GB) | 32GB DDR5 (2x16GB) |\nStorage | Row 3 - Cell 1 | Crucial P3 Plus 1TB | Crucial P3 Plus 1TB |\nGraphics | Row 4 - Cell 1 | Intel Arc Graphics 140T | Intel Iris Xe Graphics (96EU) |\n3DMark | WildLife | 24893 | 15261 |\n| Row 6 - Cell 0 | FireStrike | 8213 | 5821 |\n| Row 7 - Cell 0 | TimeSpy | 4363 | 2028 |\n| Row 8 - Cell 0 | Nomad Lite | 3436 | 1375 |\nCineBench24 | Single | 129 | 109 |\n| Row 10 - Cell 0 | Multi | 1141 | 705 |\n| Row 11 - Cell 0 | Ratio | 8.82 | 6.48 |\nGeekBench 6 | Single | 2973 | 2531 |\n| Row 13 - Cell 0 | Multi | 16097 | 10757 |\n| Row 14 - Cell 0 | OpenCL | 41700 | 16645 |\n| Row 15 - Cell 0 | Vulkan | 38605 | 20439 |\nCrystalDisk | Read MB/s | 5198 | 5218 |\n| Row 17 - Cell 0 | Write MB/s | 4726 | 4751 |\nPCMark 10 | Office | 7917 | 6067 |\nWEI | Row 19 - Cell 1 | 8.4 | 8.4 |\nMy performance assessment is one of those good cop, bad cop deals, so we\u2019ll start with the positive parts of this muddled equation.\nTo put it bluntly, this is the fastest Intel mini PC I\u2019ve ever tested. In most tests, it outperforms every machine that uses a Core Ultra 100 series processor, and it also smoked classic Core i9 12900H machines. I\u2019ve used one of these as the comparison machine, the Beelink GT Ultra, now rebranded the GTi12.\nAny test that\u2019s graphical, the Arc 140T is better than the Intel Iris Xe Graphics. The Iris X2 uses the Gen12 Xe architecture and has 96 execution units, whereas the Arc 140T is a Xe-LPG design that has 1024 shaders, equivalent to more than 128 execution units.\nIn theory, the 140T should be twice the speed of the Iris Xe, and in a few tests, it manages to achieve close to that. Also being built on a TSMC 5nm node, the 140T offers far better power efficiency and thermal management than the 10nm SuperFin construction that the Iris Xe is saddled with.\nSo this all looks good, surely?\nThere are two issues, one that is revealed by the PCMark10 bench data. The Beelink GT Ultra is roughly 75% of the performance of the EVO-T1, but it was also only about 75% of the cost when it was first launched. It can now be bought directly from Beelink with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for $579, making it an even better deal. You get performance, but at a price.\nWhat I can\u2019t offer here is any data on the latest AMD platforms to present, but hopefully, we\u2019ll see those soon. But my gut feeling is that the new Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 platforms will either match or be quicker than the Core Ultra 9 285H, mostly because they have a GPU that is rated at 8.6 TFLOPS, whereas the Intel silicon is 4.8 TFLOPS.\nThe only area where the Intel platform is likely to outperform convincingly is its AI Acceleration, which reaches 99 TOPS, compared to the AMD chip\u2019s 50 TOPS.\nWe\u2019ll be introducing some AI benchmarking shortly and exploring that in upcoming reviews.\nOverall, I'm not a fan of the 200 series, but this is as good as that line gets for the mobile chips.\n- Performance: 4.5 / 5\nGMKtec EVO-T1: Final verdict\nIt\u2019s hard to be critical of this design or specification, even if Intel appears to have lost the plot in the past couple of years with its processor designs.\nThe EVO-T1 is an exceptionally punchy platform that can take plenty of RAM and storage, making it a flexible solution that should cope with most tasks.\nIf you need even more GPU power, the inclusion of an OCuLink port could enable a discrete graphics card to deliver that. However, it can never match the performance levels of a system that connects an external GPU via PCIe directly.\nMy concern is that this is an expensive device that further blurs the lines between the cost of desktop systems and mini platforms. If this were $100 cheaper, I might be less focused on how this might be pricing itself out of some budgets, it\u2019s that fine a margin.\nBut on the plus side, this is the best-engineered mini system that GMKtec has made so far, and I can\u2019t wait to compare it to the same brand's AMD-powered EVO-X1.\nShould you buy a GMKtec EVO-T1?\nValue | Not a cheap system, but well made | 4.5 / 5 |\nDesign | Looks great if not the easiest NUC to open | 4 / 5 |\nFeatures | Powerful CPU and three M.2 slots | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Fastest Intel mini system so far | 4.5 / 5 |\nOverall | Great performance but hardly great value | 4 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want a powerful NUC\nIf you like Intel platforms and small form factors, then the EVO-T1 is the perfect option. This is the most powerful current Intel mobile platform, and this gives this little machine unprecedented flexibility.\nYou perform upgrades\nGetting into this NUC is a little convoluted but not impossible, and once inside, memory and storage slots are available to increase the RAM and drives. If you can afford it, you can put 128GB of DDR5 and 12TB of SSD capacity in this machine.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou only want it for light tasks\nThere is little point in spending this much money on a system if it\u2019s only going to be used for web applications or light office tasks. There are many more cost-effective options.\nYou need a discrete GPU\nWhile an OCuLink port is included with the EVO-T1, you will need an external OCuLink box and a power supply to run the external video card. Better choices would be either a machine like the Beelink GT Ultra (GTi12) that has a PCIe slot and cradle, or a desktop system with room for a video card. The same video card connected by PCIe will perform better than one connected by OCuLink.\nAlso Consider\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra Mini PC\nThis machine uses a 12th Gen Intel processor, but Beelink has added 13th and 14th Gen models to this series that all work with its Multi-Functional EX Pro Docking Station. This enables a PCIe 5.0 video card to connect directly to these machines for the best possible GPU performance (based on the card used). The Beelink GTi12 Ultra and the dock can be bought as a bundle for under $700, currently.\nCheck out our Beelink GTi12 Ultra Mini PC review\nMinisforum UM790 Pro\nA powerful AMD system using a Ryzen 9-class processor and the Radeon 780M GPU.

      "text": "Best mini PC of 2025: our top mini computers benchmarked for work and play\nWe put the best mini PCs, thin clients, and NUC boxes to the test\nMy team and I have tested over 100 of the best mini PC units - and I've selected my top picks for business, gaming, content creations, and everything in between.\nFor most people, the Apple Mac mini (M4) is a stellar mini computer that's well-priced, beautifully designed, and incredibly powerful, making it suitable for a range of tasks.\nFor a similarly mighty Windows mini PC, I really like what the Geekom AX8 Pro offers, while the Minisforum AtomMan G7 PT stands out as the best mini PC for gaming that the team has reviewed. And for those looking for a cheap mini PC, the GMKtec NucBox M5 Plus neatly balanced price and performance.\nBut there are plenty more featured in this round-up - each one benchmarked using industry-standard tools to explore performance across basic productivity like running office software through to heavy creative workloads to see where they shine (and why).\nUpdate: Since my last update, we've reviewed a string of new mini computers, with highlights including the GMKtec NucBox K10, the Bosgame M4, and the business-focused NiPoGi E3B 2025 Edition.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nBest mini PC overall\nSmall and stylish, our top-rated mini PC with its M4 processor is perfect for everyday office tasks, streaming movies, and even 4K video editing.\nBest on a budget\nBest budget mini PC\nWell-priced for the specs, this cheap mini PC proved to be an excellent performer with plenty of flexibility for most tasks and most people.\nBest for Windows\nBest mini PC for Windows\nA stylish machine that offered superb performance during our tests, and one of the best you can find running Windows OS.\nBest for gaming\nBest mini PC for gaming\nDesigned as a gaming mini PC, we loved how well this model handled AAA titles, alongside other graphically intense workloads.\nBest for video editing\nBest mini PC for video editing\nThe Minisforum UM790 Pro is a powerful small form-factor PC that impressed us with solid performance from office tasks to 4K video editing.\nBest for business\nBest mini PC for business\nFor a reliable, professional-grade device for a range of business uses, this model from Dell offers some great extras, including robust security features.\nLoad more products\nBest for creators\nBest mini PC for creators\nIf you're running creative tasks on your mini, we found this unit excelled at the task, particularly when using the full Adobe Creative Suite - a solid alternative to Apple.\nBest mini workstation\nBest mini PC workstation\nOnce we paired this device with Beelink's external GPU dock, we saw an astounding boost to performance, besting some mobile workstations.\nBest for small spaces\nBest mini PC for small spaces\nIt might not be the smallest mini PC we've reviewed, but this MSI NUC proved its worth and we really like the smooth performance and compact design.\nBest mini PC overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a mini PC that just works: This machine is ideal for anyone who wants to plug, play, create, and work.\n\u2705 You create content: We highly rate the Mac mini for anyone editing photos and videos, alongside running the usual office apps.\n\u274c You want a Windows machine: The Apple ecosystem isn\u2019t for everyone - especially in the NUC community.\n\u274c You want a mini PC you can upgrade: Unlike most Windows mini PCs, you don\u2019t have the luxury of upgrading this system at will.\nThe Apple Mac mini is our top choice for users who want a smooth and powerful computing experience that won\u2019t break the bank.\nSince first getting an M-series chip, the Mac mini has been the best mini PC around, and equipped with the latest M4 chipset only makes it even better. This is a device that\u2019s more than capable of everything from productivity tasks to photo and video editing. All on 16GB RAM, amazingly optimized by Apple.\nOur expert reviewer used the M4 Mac mini for general office tasks, admin, browsing the web - what I\u2019d call the essentials - and found the device worked perfectly. For 4K video editing in Adobe Premiere Pro and other intensive workloads, the machine still brilliantly kept pace, and remained virtually silent (perfect for shared workspaces). Playing games was fair, too, although you\u2019d never mistake the device for a gaming mini PC. And what about Apple Intelligence? It\u2019s been hyped to the Nth degree, but we found it\u2026fine. It was good, capable, but evidently still in its infancy. One to watch.\nBut overall, powered by the M4, the Apple Mac mini retains its lead above rivals. For performance, price, and size, there\u2019s just no beating it.\nRead our full Apple Mac mini (M4) review\nBest mini PC on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap mini PC with good specs: This model comes with either an AMD Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9 processor and 16GB RAM.\n\u2705 You want to upgrade: We found the M5 Plus was great for those who want flexibility from their mini PC.\n\u274c You need a super-cheap mini PC: Depending on your configuration, it\u2019s not the cheapest around, but for the specs, it\u2019s a very reasonably priced performer.\n\u274c You need USB 4.0 or Thunderbolt: They\u2019re completely absent here, although general port selection remains good.\nAfter an extensive review, we found the M5 Plus from GMKtec to be an affordable mini PC with plenty of positives and relatively few negatives considering the cost.\nAvailable in a range of configurations, from the cheap barebones options to a fully fledged mini desktop running Windows 11 Pro and sporting the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U, 32GB, and 1TB storage. At its cheapest, it retails for around $230 / \u00a3190, up to around $400 for the higher-end model - although I\u2019ve seen it regularly discounted.\nSpeaking of barebones, we were pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to open up the device and get inside - the top of the case can be easily prised away, and the four screws holding everything in place are clearly visible, unlike some we\u2019ve reviewed. For anyone familiar with building PCs, it won\u2019t take more than ten minutes to upgrade the RAM, storage, and reboot the system. For IT professionals, one of the best features here is the dual 2.5GbE LAN ports, making it a great pick for those creating a custom firewall with a suitable Linux distro.\nPerformance was good overall - in balanced mode, the unit was effectively silent, while the fans did start kicking in when we switched over to performance mode. As a budget mini PC, some corners have been cut. There\u2019s no metal enclosure here (although the plastic casing did a good job of keeping components safe and fans kept everything cool during use). Nor does it feature the latest Ryzen 7 processor, and still has a Radeon Vega 8 GPU. Not one for gamers and power users, then, but for general office and server duties, presentations, and running firewalls, most boxes are ticked here.\nFor a cheap mini PC, also consider the Beelink U59 (see our Beelink U59 review), which is half the price, but only has an Intel Celeron processor.\nRead our full GMKtec NucBox M5 Plus mini PC review\nBest mini PC for Windows\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a stylish mini PC with great performance: With an all-metal build, this model feels like true quality compared to others.\n\u2705 You want desktop-like specs: The AX8 Pro comes equipped with AMD Ryzen 9 chip and AMD Radeon Graphics 780M graphics for excellent performance.\n\u274c You need a mini PC on a budget: With a retail price of around $800, it\u2019s not a cheap device.\n\u274c You need a dedicated unit for video editing: We noticed a slight lag when editing high bitrate footage in Premiere Pro.\nWith its all-metal casing, stylish design, and high performance in our tests, the Geekom AX8 Pro is one of the best mini PCs running Windows, and a good pick for those that need a device for all-round use.\nPerformance across a host of software was impressive, even with apps that usually require extra compute like Photoshop, InDesign, and Premiere Pro. Check out the full review for our benchmark results, but needless to say, with the specs of this unit, it scored well across the board. It even proved solid for gaming - Fire Strike and Time Spy scores, especially for graphics and physics, prove that in medium settings, the AX8 Pro is well-equipped to tackle graphically intensive modern gaming titles.\nThe inclusion of USB 4.0 and 3.2 ports for connecting external monitors, external GPU, and storage for ultra-fast data transfers makes it suitable for photographers and video editors working with large data files. Having said that, we clocked some slowdown when we attempted to edit 4K video footage with a high bitrate, but nothing that interrupted our general workflow. In general, performance remained smooth and responsive whether conducting creative tasks or running basic office apps.\nUnder complex workloads, the fans did kick in, but the system remained cool and in any case, we didn\u2019t find them especially loud. Overall, a great all-rounder, ideal for demanding office work and medium creative applications.\nRead our full Geekom AX8 Pro mini PC review\nBest mini PC for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a mini PC for gaming: Looking like a small-form version of a traditional gaming PC, we found the design well-suited for those looking for the gamer aesthetic.\n\u2705 You want a mini PC that will tackle office and content creation: This machine easily powered through office tasks and photo and video editing.\n\u274c You prefer a subtle design: With its red and black motif emblazoned on the side, it\u2019s anything but subtle.\n\u274c You need a basic mini PC: Thanks to some high specs and expandability, this is better suited to those that want a performance boost.\nNot all mini PCs are capable of handling modern games - but the Minisforum AtomMan G7 PT doesn\u2019t have that problem. We ran the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Tekken 8 without any problems at all, and overall we found gaming performance was excellent.\nThat\u2019s not all it can do, of course - this isn\u2019t a one-trick pony, after all - and the machine also tackled the Microsoft Office suite well, too. Web browsing, word processing, and spreadsheet editing felt smooth. And when we turned our attention to content creation, Photoshop and Premiere Pro both performed well. However, we recommend taking advantage of the USB-C port to attach an external SSD, because there are storage limitations.\nSpecs-wise, the AtomMan G7 PT features an AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX chip, AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT GPU, and 32GB DDR5 dual-channel memory, which is expandable up to 96GB. You\u2019ll also find a 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe 5.0 SSD slot, with an extra M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 slot for expanding storage, too.\nThe design may be more gamer-oriented than a lot of other, subtler mini PCs, but beyond that, we don\u2019t have any real issues with the machine. Alternatively, the Asus ROG NUC 970 is a good 1440p gaming mini PC (see our Asus ROG NUC 970 review) - but it does have a higher price-tag.\nRead our full Minisforum AtomMan G7 PT mini PC review\nBest mini PC for video editing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to edit videos: In our tests, we found the Minisforum UM790 Pro tackled 4K editing with ease.\n\u2705 You want a well-specced machine at a reasonable price: Not the cheapest, but for the specifications on offer, it compares well against others on our list.\n\u274c You just want to run office apps: Although this mini PC will excel at general office usage, it might be overkill for some.\n\u274c You want a stunner of a device: Frankly, the design here is slightly plain - it won\u2019t be turning heads any time soon.\nImpressed by its size and strength, we found the Minisforum UM790 Pro is one of the best mini computers for video editing. Equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS CPU and AMD Radeon 780M GPU, in our tests it excelled in processor and graphics-intensive tasks, including gaming and 4K video editing. A number of our recommended mini PCs are up to the task, but compared to the likes of the Apple Mac mini and the AX8 Pro, this model is comparatively well-priced and well-specced, making it a good pick.\nFor creatives dealing with large files, the machine\u2019s 32GB DDR5 dual-channel RAM (expandable to 64GB) and dual M.2 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots (1TB installed) are well up to the task. Elsewhere, we were pleased with the port selection here, which includes USB 4.0 and HDMI 2.1 for connecting high-res displays. And yes, there\u2019s VESA mounting for those looking to tuck this mini PC away.\nDuring benchmark tests, the UM790 Pro proved to be a solid performer - and those high scores (see full review for more) translated into outstanding real-world performance when we ran Photoshop and Premiere Pro. We could even run games in a medium setting on this mini-beast without any issues.\nThe design might be plain, but it's practical, emphasizing functionality. While priced in the mid-range for a high-end mini PC, its strong performance and features justify the cost, appealing to those seeking powerful performance in a compact form. Alternatively, we\u2019d recommend the Apple Mac Studio for professional video editors.\nRead our full Minisforum UM790 Pro review\nBest mini PC for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an office-friendly device: Dell bills this as a \u201chigh-performance commercial desktop\u201d, and that bears out after our testing.\n\u2705 You want a reliable PC brand: As a recognisable brand, in general, you can\u2019t go wrong with modern Dell products.\n\u274c You want a cheap mini PC: No matter what way you slice it, this isn\u2019t a budget mini PC by any stretch of the imagination (or wallet).\n\u274c You need a content creation station: Like many Dell machines, this is better suited to business use than creating professional-grade content.\nWell-suited to office environments, the Dell Optiplex Micro Plus 7020 boasts a compact size that belies its power and abilities. It\u2019s worth noting that, after testing, we found this desktop to be designed - almost tailored - to the business use case. It\u2019s not a mini PC for graphics-based projects or heavy workloads and processing.\nWith that in mind, it performed remarkably well. It capably tackled multi-tasking and ran business apps with absolute ease. We tried it out by opening a multitude of spreadsheets and multiple windows while browsing the web, and saw no noticeable performance issues. Charts, graphs, images were all handled well. While lightweight, build quality feels robust enough to endure life in a busy office, or carried on the commute.\nPort selection is where we felt this mini PC was lacking. Yes, there\u2019s the usual array of USB-C ports, three DisplayPorts, but HDMI is an optional extra (we didn\u2019t have one on our review unit). If that\u2019s a deal-breaker, I strongly recommend checking out our Minisforum Venus NAB9 mini PC review, which we found also well-suited to the office environment and has two HDMI ports. We were also disappointed with the built-in 512GB storage, which is far from generous these days, and will likely require an external SSD or cloud storage back-up.\nStill, for business-grade performance, the Dell OptiPlex Micro Plus 7020 does everything you\u2019d need it to do, with a couple of configurations bumping the base unit\u2019s Intel Core i5 to Core i7 and switching 16GB RAM to 32GB, for those who need more power.\nSave on high-performance laptops and accessories with our latest Dell discounts.

In appearance, the Geekom A8 Max is fairly similar to the Mac mini, with its sleek, silver, matte aluminum casing (imitation being the highest form of flattery). But it\u2019s got the specs most creatives will need, even at pro-level.\nThis mini PC comes equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 chip with AMD Radeon 780M graphics (A Ryzen 7 variant is available). Rounding out the core specs is a 2TB SDD and 32GB DDR5-5600 MT/s RAM, expandable up to 64GB.\nIn our benchmark and real-world tests, performance was good. It\u2019s more than capable of running office apps, browsing the web, checking emails - as you\u2019d expect. But it\u2019s also perfectly equipped for editing photos or video editing up to 8K. Overall, we were impressed with the overall performance of the A8 Max - particularly how the AMD AI-enhanced processor handled the AI tasks accessible through the Adobe Creative Suite.\nHaving said that, with its integrated GPU, it\u2019s still going to struggle to power through any pro-grade 3D modeling or for playing games at max settings. And of course, while it will effortlessly run all your basic office apps and media streaming, if that\u2019s all you\u2019re intending to do, you\u2019ll find cheaper mini PCs capable of doing that.\nOverall, though, this one ticks the boxes most general content creators are going to need. Check out our Geekom AE8 mini PC review for a good alternative that\u2019s not dissimilar in specs or design.\nRead our full Geekom A8 Max mini PC review\nBest mini PC workstation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want extra power: Combining this mini PC with Beelink\u2019s external dock really gives this device a performance boost.\n\u2705 You want to future-proof the device: With the ability to swap out GPUs in the dock, you can upgrade this mini PC with the latest supported cards.\n\u274c You need a mini that\u2019s ready to go: If you want to take advantage of the full power of this machine, you\u2019ll need to get the external dock for supported GPUs.\n\u274c You need a cheap machine for video work: Costs add up here with the device, dock, and separate graphics card - and for that reason, a Mac mini or Mac Studio may be the better option.\nLet\u2019s get this straight - if you want the power of a true workstation, you\u2019ll absolutely want to opt for a traditional desktop or even a mobile workstation laptop. But if you\u2019re looking for a compact alternative, then the Beelink GTi12 Ultra with the company's external GPU dock is a good option.\nAs a standalone device, there\u2019s much to like about this large mini PC, which comes equipped with a Intel Core i9-12900H processor with double the power limit found on most laptops featuring the chip, 1TB SSD, and 32GB RAM expandable to 96GB. And for standard mini PC usage - running servers, office software, streaming media - it proved more than capable in our tests. Build construction also impressed us, the design and engineering perhaps matching the likes of Apple devices (well, almost). Port selection is also good, and includes one Thunderbolt 4 port, five USB-A, and one USB-C.\nBut this Nuc comes into its own when paired with the optional Beelink Multi-Functional EX Docking Station, letting you connect and power an external GPU. This ability to hook up PCI cards is, at present, the most unique approach we\u2019ve seen to beefing up the specs of a mini PC. We paired the device and dock with a Sapphire RX 7900 graphics card and benchmark testing showed it had about twice the speed of a mobile workstation like the Dell Precision 7780 with an Nvidia RTX 3500.\nCosts will begin to stack up here, as you\u2019ll need to buy the mini PC, the dock, and an external graphics card. So, for those on a budget, it\u2019s not going to be suitable. Nor can it really compete with the latest workstations with the highest-spec components. We should also note the dock only supports dual-slot video cards, so not every card will fit. But if you want a well-constructed mini PC with a graphics boost, it\u2019s worth exploring.\nRead our full Beelink GTi12 Ultra mini PC review\nBest mini PC for small spaces\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a serious space-saver: With an 0.8L chassis, this is a pleasingly compact mini PC suitable for areas where space is at a premium - and yes, it\u2019s VESA mountable, too.\n\u2705 You want a reliable day-to-day device: We used this as a general office mini PC and experienced no problems at all throughout testing.\n\u274c You need the smallest mini PC around: While it\u2019s one of the tiniest devices we\u2019ve reviewed, and deliciously handheld, it\u2019s not the smallest mini PC we\u2019ve ever reviewed.\n\u274c You need a creative workstation: With these specs, the MSI Cubi NUC 1M isn\u2019t designed for video editing, gaming, photo editing, or more strenuous graphical workloads.\nLooking for one of the smallest mini PCs around? Then you\u2019ll want to see the MSI Cubi NUC 1M. Measuring 135.6 x 132.5 x 50.10mm, it\u2019s one of the most compact devices we\u2019ve tested - although it\u2019s not technically the smallest mini PC on our books (for that, check out our Minisforum Mercury EM780 review).\nStill, as far as a saving on space goes, there\u2019s plenty to recommend here, with the device boasting up to an Intel Core 7 chip, a maximum of 64GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD. A barebones model is also available for those who want more freedom to build and upgrade their own unit.\nIn our tests, we found this machine effortlessly ran as a media server, streaming videos, supported multiple displays, and all the usual office software most people will need. With a raft of features, we\u2019d also suggest this mini PC would work for digital displays and as a data back-up device. During the two days of dedicated use, we experienced no problems at all.\nPossibly the best part about this mini PC, beyond its small size, is the port selection, where you\u2019ll find dual HDMI ports, two Thunderbolt ports, two 2.5G ethernet lines, four USB-A ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD Card reader.\nIt\u2019s not really designed for creative use, so don\u2019t go expecting it to be a space-saving mini PC for high-resolution photo and video editing.

You can also completely conceal them behind your monitor if they come with VESA mounting holes.\nToday's best mini PCs are a great alternative to bulky full-size desktops and all-in-one systems for all kinds of uses: from administrative workers doing data entry, to customer service specialists and call center offices, to creative professionals and students learning at home.\nWhat is the best use of a mini PC?\nMini PCs excel at everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, video streaming, and light gaming. You can easily connect them to your TV to play games and watch movies either via a platform like Netflix or through your own media server, with the effectively set acting as a monitor. With specs comparable to mid-range laptops, they don\u2019t have the necessary CPU and GPU to run more resource-intensive apps and games. In those circumstances, it may be worth investing in high-spec devices like the best video editing laptops, which are built for heavy workloads.\nWhat are the disadvantages of a mini computer?\nWhile the best mini PCs absolutely shine, they\u2019re not without a few downsides. When it comes to specs, mini PCs pale in comparison to modern desktop computers and the very best laptops. While you shouldn't have trouble using most as a space-saving alternative to the best laptops for graphic design or the best laptops for photo editing, it can make it difficult to use hardware-intensive apps and processes, like any of the best video editing software.\nUpgrading those lower-specced internals is usually out of the question. Even some of the best mini PCs can't be expanded with better components (at least, not without some technical knowledge and skill).\nThey also need to be run from the mains, so while they\u2019re an excellent portable option, you lack the built-in batteries found in laptops. Due to their form, some users may also experience issues with overheating. Mini PCs also lack peripherals, from screens to optical drives.\nHow much RAM do you need for a mini PC?\nAs with desktop computers and laptops, the best RAM is the most amount of RAM you can get within budget. It will make performance much more fluid, especially if you\u2019re using the mini PC for a lot of tasks. We recommend a bare minimum of 8GB memory, although 16GB and above is preferred.\nAre mini PCs good for gaming?\nIt all depends on which games you want to play. The very best mini PCs can ably run lightweight or older games - in fact, many use them as emulators. However, they will typically struggle with newer games, like the triple-A offerings from the likes of Rockstar. They simply don\u2019t have the required CPU and GPU to handle them.\nCan you connect a mini PC to a laptop?\nYes, you can connect your mini PC to a laptop and use it as a monitor - but it\u2019s also easy, as many mini PCs lack the required HDMI ports to output to the laptop screen. One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is by using remote desktop software.\nAre the best mini PCs better than laptops?\nIt depends how you intend to use your mini computer. While both are highly portable, mini PCs are more so, with a far smaller surface area. If you\u2019re working on the go, be aware of the sometimes limited battery life on laptops - if you\u2019re usually running off the mains, a mini PC may be the better choice.\nLaptops serve as a great all-in-one solution with everything you need to work and play. Accessories like the best office keyboards and the best monitors for a dual set-up are optional. They also come with a range of tech specs, with options for everyday computing tasks right up to the best gaming laptops.\nLike a traditional desktop computer, a mini PC is best when used in spaces with easy access to monitors (or TV), keyboards, and other peripherals on hand. For this reason, mini PCs are great for office use, allowing multiple users to access the device in a variety of locations. Cost is also a factor, as mini PCs tend to be cheaper than laptops.\nHow to choose the best mini PC for you\nWhen choosing which mini PC is best for you, there are several factors to consider - but first, it's important to be sure a mini PC is right for your needs.\nMini PCs, sometimes known as think clients or NUCs, are ideal for light use, such as web browsing and video streaming. Some can even handle casual gaming sessions. But you won't find the raw power offered by the likes of the best mobile workstations.\nDespite their name, mini PCs come in a range of sizes, from tiny machines like the Acemagician T8 Plus to the Apple Mac mini, which on the larger size. But they're all considerably smaller than a desktop, so if you're looking for a space-saver, they're ideal. You'll find plenty that even include a VESA mount for attaching the device to monitors to de-clutter the desk.\nIf a mini PC is best, consider how you'll be using your machine. In addition to general computer usage, mini PCs have been used as media servers, games emulators, and much more.\nFor smooth performance. a good CPU, GPU, and RAM are essential. We've included a selection of AMD- and Intel-powered thin clients here, all capable of delivering speed and performance for a range of uses.\nHowever, be sure to check your device's ports and connectivity. Some of the best mini PCs pack in plenty of Thunderbolt and USB ports, memory card slots, and HDMI connections, but some are less generous. If portability is a consideration, remember to check dimensions and weight. You'll find these details in our full mini PC reviews.\nWhen it comes to budget, mini PCs tend to retail for around $100 and up, although we recommend checking out our round-up of the best Prime Day PC deals and Black Friday mini PC deals, as you can make big savings when the sales are on.\nHow we test the best mini PCs\nWe've tested thousands of devices, from the best photo editing PCs to best video editing Mac and MacBook laptops and best business monitors. And we have extensive experience with small-form NUCs and thin clients.\nA lot of time and care goes into selecting the best mini PCs. Appliance-type mini-PCs often have a metal enclosure to help with passive cooling and more than one wired Gigabit Ethernet port. The best mini PCs are perfect for leaving unattended in a small network cabinet, rack, or locker, where they can be used as fixed-function mini-servers, such as a firewall for an office network or file storage for a small shop.\nThere's also a class of mini PCs that are small. These range from palm-sized to slightly more significant than a thumb drive, often with an HDMI male connector and built to be attached to the back of a TV or monitor for entertainment or web browsing on a big screen.\nAs such, selecting a mini PC is no easy task. First, we had to filter them based on size. We started from the tiniest ones, the thumb drive-sized PCs, up to the palm-sized devices, then moving to the TV-box-sized machines. In each size jump, we looked for the usage scenarios for each based on the capabilities of the CPU and amount of RAM and included ports, then we weeded out the ones with sub-par specs; this removed several dozen entries with the same Celeron CPUs and low RAM.\nOnce we got to the higher-spec entries, the winners started to show up either by expansion capabilities, unique features, or suitability for the purpose. Final filtering by brand name and support considerations is how we ended up with our selection of picks for the best mini PC for home and office.\nAs such, when testing which mini PC is best, we study several key areas. This includes build quality and form-factor - we want to see a robust machine, and the best materials available for the cost. This is especially true with mini PCs, as they're designed to be easily carried and used in multiple locations.\nWe explore the internal specs of each device, and how they compare with some of the other best mini PCs on the market. As part of this process, we also assess the upgradability of the device - from the options on offer to the ease of creating your perfect mini PC. This includes benchmarking performance of the CPU, GPU, and RAM. We're not necessarily looking for the most powerful mini PC. But we want to see suitable performance relative to a range of uses and budgets.\nPorts and connectivity are another area where we look at what's on offer - and how it compares with rival devices. Not everyone will need Thunderbolt 4, but we expect to see adequate slots on a mini PC to increase functionality and flexibility.\nPrice is always a consideration. Depending on how you use it, the most expensive mini PC you can buy may not offer genuine value for money. We've curated a selection of mini PCs here, from premium machines to the cheapest mini PC with great performance.\nYou can read more about our comprehensive testing methods in our guide How we test laptops and desktops: Our review process explained.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSteve is B2B Editor for Creative & Hardware at TechRadar Pro.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe chasm between what Intel is offering on the desktop and for Workstation is getting larger and brings the logic of machines like the Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Tower into question. However, things are worse when you consider its value proposition.\nPros\n- +\nIntel Core i7-13700\n- +\nLots of USB ports\n- +\nLarger case than P2 design\nCons\n- -\nW680 Chipset\n- -\nGigabit Ethernet\n- -\nM.2 PCIe 4.0, not 5.0\n- -\nBizarre ventilation management\n- -\nSlow professional graphics card\n- -\nLimited GPU and memory upgrades\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nLenovo ThinkStation P3: 30-second review\nHaving recently covered the Lenovo ThinkStation P2, we were interested to see what the P3 offers and if it addressed any issues we noticed with its predecessor.\nAgain, this is a W680 chipset motherboard combined with a Raptor Lake desktop CPU, and in our review hardware, it came with an Nvidia RX A2000 12GB GPU.\nOne of the critical problems of the P2 was that its tower case didn't allow for the larger video cards, which are exactly the ones that Workstation users might reasonably want.\nThe P3 has a much larger case with extra space for GPUs, and it also provides a sufficient frontal area for an externally removable 3.5-inch SATA drive bay.\nHowever, there are only two x16 PCIe slots, plus a single x1 PCIe and only five backplate positions. That's much less than a typical desktop gaming case, and if you use a video card that needs three slots, there isn't room for anything else here.\nThose things said this is a better design than the P2 as it has fewer internal restrictions.\nHowever, this machine is overpriced and being declared a 'Workstation' doesn't give it features that desktop machines haven't got. In fact, there are lots of features that desktop PC users have enjoyed for some time, like PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots and Thunderbolt ports, that are not in this system.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Tower Workstation is a study system designed for floor standing, and it can be supplied with lots of processing power, GPU performance, memory, and storage. Entry level for the P3 is inexpensive, but that doesn't make it a bargain by any means.\nLenovo ThinkStation P3: Price & availability\n- How much does it cost? From \u00a31006\n- When is it out? Available now\n- Where can you get it? Direct from Lenovo\nAs with many PC makers, Lenovo makes basic models of the P3 Tower Workstation, which purchasers are encouraged to then enhance as far as their budgets will take them.\nThe starting point for the P3 Tower is a 13th Generation Intel Core i5-13400 processor, 8GB of RAM and no storage or video card.\nOur review system, which has an Intel Core i7-13700 vPro CPU, 128GB of RAM, 512GB of NVMe storage, and an Nvidia A2000 12GB GPU, costs \u00a32,392.09 in the UK and $3,082.12 in the USA.\nFor those curious, Lenovo USA prices 32GB DDR4 4400MHz EEC memory at a penny short of $600 each, another $120 more per module than ordinary memory.\nIt's worth pointing out that on this platform, the ECC DDR5 feature is disabled even if the installed modules offer that, unfortunately. And also, Corsair Vengeance (CMK64GX5M2A4800C40) 4800MHz memory is about $70 per 32GB module from Amazon.\nThe RTX A2000 12GB is priced at $789, a price that would get you an MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super 16G Ventus 3X Black, or an XFX Speedster MERC310 AMD Radeon RX 7900XTX Black Gaming Graphics Card with 24GB through an online retailer.\nBuying this system fully populated isn't a cost-effective option, even if those items will be included under the warranty.\nLooking at competitor offerings, Dell doesn't have a system that fits well with the P3 Tower, but HP has the Z2 Tower, which is similar. The HP Z2 G9 Tower Workstation with a Core i9-14900K, 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 12GB is \u00a32351.99 inc. VAT in the UK. Lower priced than the Lenovo, with less RAM but improved CPU and GPU specifications.\nIn most respects, all PC builders appear to apply a price premium to any machine sold as a 'workstation' that often the equipment doesn't justify.\n- Value: 3 / 5\nLenovo ThinkStation P3: Specifications\n| Model: | Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Tower |\n|---|---|\n| CPU: | Intel Core i7-13700 |\n| GPU: | Nvidia RTX A2000 12GB |\n| RAM: | 128GB DDR5-5600 (4x 32GB) |\n| Storage NVMe: | 512 GB KIOXIA KXG8AZNV512G, 1x M.2 2280 NVMe slot unused |\n| Storage SATA: | 3x SATA III bays for 3.5 or 2.5 inch drives |\n| Ports: | 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 data transfer only2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 28x USB 2.02x HDMI 2.12x DisplayPort 1.42x Headphone jack 3.5mm 1x microphone jack 3.5mm1x SD Card reader |\n| Networking: | 1x 1GbE LAN port |\n| OS: | Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed) |\n| Biometrics: | None |\n| PSU: | Hunkey 750W fixed cables |\n| Dimensions: | 370mm(L) \u00d7 180mm(W) \u00d7 415mm(H) |\n| Weight | 10Kg |\nLenovo ThinkStation P3: Design\n- Bigger case than P2\n- Limited expansion options\n- Lacks Thunderbolt or USB 4.0\n- No 2.5GbE LAN\nThe big selling point of this machine over the P2 model is the larger case, which means, in theory, this system can be upgraded significantly. However, the design has a few quirks that reduce the internal volume, specifically a deep pocket on the front with the front-facing ports and an exposed SATA drive bay 7cm behind the front face.\nThe advantage of that recess is that it gives room for a carry handle at the front (none at the back), but it restricts the case to a single front fan and wastes about 8% of the potential volume.\nEven with this oddity, this case can physically take larger video cards, and we tested that by mounting the Sapphire RX 7900 GRE, a triple fan assembly that is 322mm long.\nBut mounting and running are two entirely different things, and that card wouldn't run because the provided Hunkey 750W PSU only has a single 6+2 PCIe power line, and the RX 79000 GRE needs two of those.\nTherefore, if you want to run a high-performance video card in this machine, budget for PSU replacement. You will need to find one that ideally has cable management but isn't oversized unless you don't intend to use the lower drive cages.\nThose taking that path need to be aware that both PCIe x16 slots are only accessible if the cards are only dual slot wide, as a triple-sized card will cover both x16 slots.\nIf this sounds excessively cramped for what looks like a decent-sized enclosure, it is.\nA contributing factor is that the Lenovo engineers responsible for this machine decided that the top and bottom of the case are effectively different thermal management zones, with the graphics card forming a barrier to heat in the bottom of the case.\nWhile there are some paths for air to travel from the front and side of the case, all the heat generated by the CPU, memory and front-mounted hard drive is ejected using a small 80mm fan from the rear. The heat from below that, which includes the PSU that vents internally (no, really\u2026), the M.2 slots, two floor-mounted hard drives, and the video card has one 120mm fan sucking air in the front and two expelling it out from the door.\nBy definition, the bottom of the case will be a low-pressure zone, probably pulling air down from above, making for truly abysmal airflow through the case.\nPerhaps Lenovo needs to research ventral exhausts and airflow balance because the P3 lacks either of these.\nThe pre-installed NVMe drive does have a custom heatsink at least, but Lenovo doesn't provide another for the other bay, and other than a power cable and a mouse, the system comes with none of the cables and items that a system might typically need.\nPorts are always different with workstations, but the ones on this system defy any logic.\nThe front has two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports and a single USB-C Gen 2, but none of that bandwidth is available on the back. Instead, there is a curious obsession with USB 2.0 ports, with four of those on the back, another two on the front, and another two on a backplate, a user-selectable option.\nWhy anyone would need so many USB ports on the machine is a mystery, almost as big as why this machine does not have USB 4.0 or Thunderbolt ports externally.\nWe did notice a Thunderbolt header on the motherboard, meaning that with the right addon card, Thunderbolt 3 might be able to be added to this system, but it isn't one of the options Lenovo offers.\nGiven the use profile of a Workstation where large amounts of data might be generated by the system, having the best methods of extracting that as a single gigabit Ethernet LAN port, USB 3.2 Gen 2, or a removable SATA drive seems, at best, silly.\nHaving Thunderbolt would be ideal, but the best alternative would be to install a 10GbE LAN card, limiting the system to a single video card in this instance.\nThe obvious conclusion from all these caveats to getting the maximum performance from this platform is that those who designed it weren't given a brief to deliver that type of system for whatever reasons.\nThe P3 is better than the P2, but this is a far cry from the performance potential of a gaming system, especially one that uses the new Z790 chipset.\nOverall, this is a better case and layout than the P2, but it falls short of what a custom-built system for performance computing might provide.\n- Design: 3.5 / 5\nLenovo ThinkStation P3: Features\n- Intel Core i7-13700\n- Intel W680 chipset\n- Port limitations\nLike the P2 previously, the processor in this Workstation is a Raptor Lake processor, the exact type that Intel had issues with just after launch.\nWe experienced no problems, but some have, so you are aware.\nThe Core i7-13700 is a 14th-generation part and has many of the classic features of the previous Core models but lacks the enhancements in AI that the new Core Ultra chips offer.\nIt has 16 cores (8 P-cores + 8 E-cores) and 24 threads, making it reasonably effective with problems that can be multi-threaded.\nFor Intel desktop systems, an overclockable version of this chip designated the i7-13700K, is available with clock enhancements, but Lenovo did not use that chip in our P3.\nA bigger issue, and one that blighted the P2 model, is the W680 chipset, a workstation-class platform that inexplicably doesn't support the LGA 1700 Xeon processor line.\nIt does support ECC memory, except the error-correcting part with this processor is disabled.\nIn our review hardware there are four 32GB modules, giving a total of 128GB of DDR5, and with more than one module, the bandwidth is effectively doubled over what the P2 we reviewed, with its single DDR5 DIMM, could offer.\nWhile the i7-13700K is a PCIe 5.0 processor, the chipset is only PCIe 4.0, and the I/O on this board appears to be wired to that. Therefore, this motherboard only has two M.2 NVMe slots, and both are only PCIe Gen 4x4, with no support for Gen 5 SSDs.\nEven using the chipset's PCIe 4.0 functionality, this system's port selection is poor. We've reviewed NUC-sized Mini PC systems with better port selection that cost a fraction of this system.\nEspecially disappointing is the lack of Thunderbolt technology, despite there being a Thunderbolt header on the motherboard. A workstation-class PC with a single gigabit Ethernet port is equally incomprehensible.\nIt should have Thunderbolt by default, PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots, and 2.5GbE, 5GbE, or 10GbE LAN ports, but it does not have ticks in any of these boxes.\nWhat it does offer is remarkably piecemeal and hardly what anyone building a powerful system would naturally gravitate to using.\n- Features: 3.5 / 5\nLenovo ThinkStation P3: Performance\n- Powerful CPU\n- Expensive RTX A2000 12GB\n| Workstations | Header Cell - Column 1 | Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Tower | Lenovo ThinkStation P2 Tower |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| CPU | Row 0 - Cell 1 | Intel Core i7-13700 vPro | Intel Core i9-14900K |\n| Cores/Threads | Row 1 - Cell 1 | 16C/24T | 24C/32T |\n| TPD | Row 2 - Cell 1 | 65W-219W | 125W-253W |\n| RAM | Row 3 - Cell 1 | 128GB (4x32GB) SK Hynix 5600 | 32GB (1x32GB) SK Hynix 5600 |\n| SSD | Row 4 - Cell 1 | 512 GB KIOXIA KXG8AZNV512G | SAMSUNG PM9A1a OEM 1TB |\n| Graphics | Row 5 - Cell 1 | RTX A2000 12GB | RTX 4060 8GB |\n| 3DMark | PCI Express | 23.85GB/s | 12.21GB/s |\n| Row 7 - Cell 0 | WildLife | 36309 | 66422 |\n| Row 8 - Cell 0 | FireStrike | 15611 | 27271 |\n| Row 9 - Cell 0 | TimeSpy | 6570 | 11155 |\n| Row 10 - Cell 0 | Port Royal | 3439 | 6125 |\n| Row 11 - Cell 0 | Steel Nomad Lite | 6165 | 10795 |\n| Row 12 - Cell 0 | Steel Nomad | 1344 | 2308 |\n| Blender Bench | CPU | 311.78 | 423.83 |\n| Row 14 - Cell 0 | GPU | 1822.1 | 3183.48 |\n| CineBench24 | GPU | 6948 | 10615 |\n| Row 16 - Cell 0 | Single | 116 | 127 |\n| Row 17 - Cell 0 | Multi | 1231 | 1369 |\n| Row 18 - Cell 0 | Ratio | 10.6 | 10.78 |\n| GeekBench 6 | Single | 2707 | 2992 |\n| Row 20 - Cell 0 | Multi | 16414 | 14540 |\n| Row 21 - Cell 0 | OpenCL | 73966 | 105942 |\n| Row 22 - Cell 0 | Vulkan | 73543 | 99006 |\n| CrystalDIsk | Read MB/s | 7079 | 7011 |\n| Row 24 - Cell 0 | Write MB/s | 5041 | 4915 |\n| PCMark 10 | Office | 8019 | 8777 |\n| WEI | Row 26 - Cell 1 | 9.2 | 9.6 |\nBefore any complaints that these systems weren't suitable for comparison, we accepted that view, but these were the specifications of the review hardware sent by Lenovo, not specified by us.\nThe P2 Tower was powered by a faster i9 processor with more cores, and it is possible to get the P3 Tower with that CPU installed. But one of the new Core Ultra series, which offers much better AI processing, isn't an option.\nDue to the reduced core count and clock speeds, the Intel Core i7-13700 vPro is about 70% of the speed of the Intel Core i9-14900K, and choosing that on the P3 Tower would increase costs by about $400.\nHowever, where things start to get more separated are those tests that are focused on GPU power, with the P2 using the RTX 4060 8GB and the P3 with the RTX A2000 12GB.\nThere are plenty of discussions about the advantages and disadvantages of retail consumer video cards over those made specifically for workstation applications, so I'm not going to rehash that here.\nWhat's important to realise is that the technology in the A2000 is from the previous Ampere generation, and it's effectively a variant of RTX 3060Ti with 12GB of memory.\nIn the graphics tests, it gets trounced by the RTX 4060 8GB, a card which I previously declared unsuitable for workstation use due to lack of memory.\nThe chin-rubbing moment comes when you realise that Lenovo is asking about the same money for the A2000 as you would pay for an Nvidia RTX 4070 12GB or an AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT 16GB. And, if you hadn't already guessed, those GPUs would make the A2000 weep irrespective of the test.\nWhat's even more concerning is that we recently reviewed the Geekom MegaMini G1 system with an integrated RTX 4060 GTX, and for around $1200, it delivered better graphics performance than the P3, even if its mobile processor couldn't match the Core i7-13700 vPro.\nBut being brutal, none of these cards are up to workstation use. Running local AI models on a video card requires much more memory, 24GB or more, and 12GB on a three-year-old G106 isn't even close to what's required.\nNvidia can dress up old silicon as professional graphics cards if it likes, but the numbers here speak volumes, especially the Blender GPU score.\nLenovo has options to address that requirement, like the RTX 5000 Ada Generation, but including that would triple the cost of this system, if not more.\nIf you want decent graphics but have no intention of running local AI models, then buy a retail RTX 4070 or an RX 4800 XT and get substantially more performance for the same money as an A2000.\nOne final warning about the A2000 is that it comes, oddly, with four Mini DP outputs and no full-sized DP or HDMI. Therefore, if you order this card and don't have Mini DP to DP cables handy, and these aren't common, you will have no way to run the machine when it arrives, as Lenovo includes none of these by default.\n- Performance: 3.5/ 5\nLenovo ThinkStation P3: Final verdict\nMany of the problems that the P3 has are the same ones as the P2 Tower, but with more physical space inside for them to stretch their legs.\nYet that extra volume isn't well used, and the ventilation system is especially poor.\nBut we're skirting around the elephant in this room, namely, the features that make a workstation different from a gaming PC.\nIn this context, those are workstation-class motherboards missing most of the latest features, such as USB 4.0 and the ability to properly use ECC memory.\nThe included PSU isn't suitable for a high-end video card, and in our model, that was a rebranding of the old RTX 3060. It is an old design that has been significantly overtaken by Nividia 40 series cards and most of the latest AMD Radeon RX line.\nWhen you realise that the poor port selection doesn't address the performance nature of workstations, you begin to wonder how we got here.\nWe could blame Lenovo for this disconnect, but the issue is how Intel shafted its workstation platforms by delivering such underwhelming chipsets as the W680 that can't accept Xeon processors.\nIntel has the W780 waiting in the wings and a new slew of Xeon processors that are compatible with it. Those looking for ECC memory support and more concurrent motherboard features might want to wait for those to appear, even if we assume they'll cost even more than the P3 Tower does.\nShould you buy a Lenovo ThinkStation P3?\n| Attributes | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | Expensive for what performance it has. | 3 / 5 |\n| Design | More space than the P2, but that space isn't well used. | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Features | A powerful desktop processor is saddled with a workstation motherboard that isn't well-featured. | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Performance | Fast processor combined with old GPU technology | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Overall | A workstation name, but not performance | 3.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou have money to burn\nTurning this system into a true workstation will probably involve spending at least three times the quoted price of the review hardware and maybe four times. It needs a better PSU, video card, 10GbE LAN ports and Thunderbolt, if it is even possible to add those things.\nHowever, with the new W780 series boards on the horizon, this might not be a sound investment.\nDon't Buy it if...\nYou generate large amounts of data\nThe lack of connectivity in this machine is a stumbling block to those who process large data sets before handing the results on. The best external connections are over USB 3.2 Gen 2 with a limit of 1,000MB/s. It's not ideal when you might have terabytes of data to shift on a regular basis.\nYou want something easy to upgrade\nIf you want to expand the capabilities of the P3 Tower, the limited slot layout and port selection are issues. Also, there isn't enough space inside for a larger PSU with cable management.\nWant to power-up productivity on the go we reviewed the best mobile workstations.\nMark is an expert on 3D printers, drones and phones.
