      "summary": "Kevin Sneader, Goldman Sachs’ Asia Pacific ex‑Japan President, highlighted the ongoing equity rally in China driven by domestic retail savings and improving investor sentiment, while noting that foreign capital still requires clearer policy signals and consistency. He emphasized the bank’s long‑standing presence in China and its focus on supporting clients amid a robust Hong Kong IPO boom, with 57 deals this year and 200 in the pipeline. In India, Sneader outlined continued expansion of the Mumbai office and a commitment to growth in investment banking, ECM, and equities, driven by domestic consumption and services momentum. He stressed that geopolitical tensions with the US may affect short‑term dynamics but should not derail the long‑term growth trajectory for both China and India, where Goldman plans to deepen its client footprint.\n",
