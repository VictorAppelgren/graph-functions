  "content": "Today, the mortgage interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.45%, according to the Mortgage Research Center, while the average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.40%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.65%.\n\nBorrowers paid an average rate of 6.45% on a 30-year mortgage. This was up from the previous week\u2019s rate of 6.44%.\n\nCurrently, the average APR on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.48%. This is higher than last week when the APR was 6.47%. The APR contains both mortgage interest and the lender fees to help give a more complete picture of loan costs.\n\nTo get an idea of how much you\u2019ll pay: a $100,000 mortgage with a 30-year fixed-rate loan at the current average interest rate of 6.45% will cost you about $629 including principal and interest (taxes and fees not included) each month, the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. That\u2019s around $127,119 in total interest over the life of the loan.\n\nToday\u2019s 15-year mortgage (fixed-rate) is 5.4%, down 0.48% from the previous week. The same time last week, the 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage was at 5.43%.\n\nThe APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.45%. It was 5.47% a week earlier.\n\nA 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage with today\u2019s interest rate of 5.4% will cost $812 per month in principal and interest on a $100,000 mortgage (not including taxes and insurance). In this scenario, borrowers would pay approximately $46,598 in total interest.\n\nThe current average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage (a mortgage above 2025\u2019s conforming loan limit of $806,500 in most areas) is 6.65%. Last week, the average rate was 6.65%.\n\nIf you lock in the latest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage, you will pay $642 per month in principal and interest per $100,000 borrowed, which amounts to $131,632 in total interest over the life of the loan.\n\nAfter reaching 7.04% in January, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has steadily remained in the mid-to-high 6% range. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate has hovered between the low-6% and high-5% range since its January peak of 6.27%.\n\nWhile rates dropped in mid-January 2025, experts aren\u2019t forecasting a significant decrease in the near future.\n\nWhen Can I Expect Mortgage Rates To Drop?\n\nMortgage rates are influenced by various economic factors, making it difficult to predict when they will drop.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions and global events also play a key role in shaping mortgage rates. If inflation rises or the economy slows, the Fed may lower its federal funds rate. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fed reduced rates, which drove interest rates to record lows.\n\nA significant drop in mortgage rates seems unlikely in the near future. However, they may decline if inflation eases or the economy weakens.\n\nOne of the first steps in buying a house is budgeting. To get a general idea of how much owning a home will cost, start by using a mortgage calculator to crunch the numbers.\n\nJust input the following data to get an idea of how much a house will cost:\n\nMultiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy\u2019s overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn\u2019t directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.\n\nHome buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.\n\nFurther, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term.\n\nWhat Is the Best Type of Mortgage Loan?\n\nMany home buyers are eligible for several mortgage loan types. Each program can have its own advantages:\n\u2022 Conventional mortgage. A conventional home loan is ideal for borrowers with good or excellent credit to qualify for competitive rates. Additionally, making a minimum 20% down payment helps you waive private mortgage insurance premiums.\n\u2022 FHA loan. An is best when applying with imperfect credit or a low down payment. You can put as little as 3.5% down with a credit score above 580. A minimum 10% down payment is necessary for credit scores ranging from 500 to 579.\n\u2022 VA loan. Borrowers with a qualifying military background may prefer a for its flexibility. A down payment may not be required. While you pay a one-time , there are no ongoing mortgage insurance premiums or service fees.\n\u2022 USDA loan. Applicants in eligible rural areas can buy or build a home with no down payment, although an upfront and annual guarantee fee applies. Additionally, income requirements apply and this program requires a moderate income or lower.\n\u2022 Jumbo loan. Homebuyers in a high-cost-of-living area will need to apply for a jumbo loan when the loan amount exceeds the Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s limits. The limit in most municipalities is $806,500 in 2025.\n\nHow do you get a lower mortgage interest rate? Comparing lenders and loan programs is an excellent start. Borrowers should also strive for a good or excellent credit score between 670 and 850 and a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less. Further, making a minimum down payment of 20% on conventional mortgages can help you automatically waive private mortgage insurance premiums, which increases your borrowing costs. Buying discount points or lender credits can also reduce your interest rate. How often do mortgage rates change? If you\u2019re shopping around for a mortgage, remember that you might be able to lock in a rate for 30 up to 120 days, depending on the lender. Note that some lenders charge a fee to lock your rate while others offer the service for free. Choosing between a fixed- or adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) depends on your financial situation. A fixed-rate mortgage suits those who want consistent monthly payments throughout the loan term without worrying about fluctuations in their rate or payments in response to market changes. If mortgage rates are low, securing a fixed rate can save you money in the long run. An ARM, on the other hand, may appeal to those who want a lower initial rate and monthly payment. However, you also run the risk of ending up with higher payments if your rate fluctuates. If you expect your income to rise, you may feel confident handling these potential payment increases. These mortgages can also work well for those who plan to live in a home for only a few years, as you might sell or move before the rate adjusts.",

      "text": "When shopping for a home, finding the house of your dreams is only half the battle. Unless you\u2019re paying cash, the second half of the homeownership challenge is finding a mortgage to finance that dream. How do you know which type of mortgage is best for you?\nIt\u2019s not as simple as choosing between a 15-year and a 30-year term\u2014or whether you prefer to pay a fixed interest rate for the life of the mortgage or to have an adjustable interest rate, or ARM. You\u2019ll need to take into account how much money you need to borrow, which is affected by the size of the down payment you\u2019ll make, as well as the state of your credit.\nThe best mortgage will always be the one that\u2019s a match for your financial goals. With so many options, however, finding that ideal fit could feel daunting.\nTo help you choose a mortgage with greater confidence, let\u2019s examine the six most common types of mortgages: conventional, jumbo, FHA, USDA, VA and 203(k). This information will help equip you to make decisions about the best mortgage to meet your needs.\nConventional Mortgage\nWhen you get a mortgage that\u2019s not backed by a government agency, you\u2019re likely getting a conventional mortgage.\nPrivate lenders, such as banks and credit unions, fund conventional mortgages. These loans are flexible in purpose, and you can use the proceeds to purchase either your primary or secondary residence. The amount you\u2019re able to borrow follows income and down payment guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and loan limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA).\nQualification guidelines for conventional mortgages often require a higher credit score than government-backed loans. According to Experian, it\u2019s possible to qualify for a conventional mortgage with a score as low as 620. Many lenders prefer borrowers with credit scores 660 or higher. If you have a higher credit score, especially one that\u2019s 740 or higher, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a lower mortgage rate when you choose a conventional mortgage.\nIn addition to credit score guidelines, conventional mortgages typically require a 20% down payment for the best rates. If you\u2019re putting down less, you\u2019ll likely have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) until you have 20% equity in your home. PMI is an insurance policy that protects the lender if you default on your loan.\nLenders charge PMI to protect themselves because borrowers putting down less than 20% have less \u201cskin in the game\u201d and stand to lose less if they default. PMI adds extra to your monthly mortgage payment, usually between 0.3 to 1.5% of your loan amount.\nConventional mortgages can be conforming or nonconforming. A nonconforming loan is known as a jumbo loan. We\u2019ll talk about that type of loan in the next section.\nConforming Conventional Loans\nConforming conventional loans do just that\u2014they conform to high-end lending limits set forth by Fannie Mae. For 2020, the conforming loan limit for a single-family home is $510,400 for most U.S. states and Puerto Rico.\nThere are, however, exceptions to the high-end limits if you live in areas designated as \u201chigh cost\u201d by the FHFA. There are 19 states and the District of Columbia with high-cost regions. If you live in one of these areas, the high-end loan limit for a single-family home goes up to $765,600.\nPros of Conforming Conventional Mortgages\n- Available from a wide variety of lenders, both local and online\n- Can be used for primary or secondary residences\n- Low down payment options (often from 0% to 3%)\nCons of Conforming Conventional Mortgages\n- Stricter qualifications than government-backed loans\n- Potential PMI requirements if you put down less than 20%\nWhen a Conforming Conventional Mortgage Might be Best\n- You\u2019re putting 10% to 20% down\n- You have a higher credit score (over 740)\nJumbo Mortgages\nA \u201cjumbo\u201d mortgage is a loan that falls outside the lending limits set by the FHFA. Because of this, jumbo mortgages are nonconforming conventional loans. If you\u2019re buying a luxury home, you\u2019ll likely be looking at a jumbo mortgage to accommodate the price.\nLenders see these larger mortgages as riskier than conforming loans since they\u2019re not guaranteed by any of the government-sponsored entities (GSEs). Thus, the qualification guidelines are often more stringent.\nBorrowers should have credit scores in the 700 range when applying for a jumbo loan. Experian notes that many lenders want scores 720 or higher and won\u2019t consider borrowers with scores lower than 600.\nJumbo loans have higher down payment requirements than conventional mortgages, usually in the 20% to 30% range. Lenders also like to see higher cash reserves for jumbo loan borrowers and debt-to-income ratios at a maximum of 36%.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for buyers to encounter higher but competitive interest rates and closing costs compared to conforming conventional mortgages and loans backed by GSEs.\nPros of Jumbo Mortgages\n- Higher lending limits to broaden your purchase options\n- Interest rates that are competitive with conforming conventional loans\n- Can help buy more expensive homes in areas not designated as high-cost areas by the FHFA\nCons of Jumbo Mortgages\n- Higher asset requirements than conventional conforming mortgages\n- Stricter qualifications than conforming conventional mortgages and government-backed loans\nWhen a Jumbo Mortgage Might be Best\n- You have substantial funds for a down payment and a high credit score\n- Your home purchase price is higher than $510,400 in most areas, or $765,600 in some high-cost regions\nGovernment-Insured Mortgages\nGovernment-insured mortgages are plentiful in the marketplace. A different government-sponsored entity guarantees each type of loan and has unique qualification procedures.\nThese loans make homeownership accessible to a wide range of low- to mid-income buyers, including first-time buyers, because of their flexible qualification and down payment criteria. We highlight four different kinds of government-insured mortgages below.\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) Loans\nFHA loans are guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and have qualification criteria that open the door for a variety of borrowers. With an FHA loan, your credit score and down payment are linked.\nBorrowers with a minimum 580 credit score qualify for the lowest down payment: 3.5% of the purchase price. If your credit score is a bit lower (in 500-579 range), you\u2019ll need to bump your down payment up to 10%. There\u2019s a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 43% for all borrowers, and these mortgages must fund a borrower\u2019s primary residence. For all borrowers, PMI is required for down payments less than 20%.\nPros of FHA Mortgages\n- Flexibility on credit score and down payment\n- Down payments as low as 3.5%\nCons of FHA Mortgages\n- Can only be used for primary residences\n- Low down payments require PMI\nWhen an FHA Mortgage Might be Best\n- You can only afford a small down payment\n- You have credit bumps in your past but a current good pay history\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Loans\nBacked by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA loans help low- to moderate-income buyers in designated rural and suburban areas. While it might seem to be only for farmland on the surface, USDA loans can buy primary residences for qualified applicants.\nBorrowers looking to buy a home in areas designated as eligible by the USDA need to meet strict income limits. These limits are specific to the locality where you\u2019re buying a home. Buyers under the USDA program typically don\u2019t qualify for mortgages from other sources. USDA loans are available from a wide variety of local and online lenders and, in some cases, directly from the USDA itself for some low-income applicants.\nThe USDA doesn\u2019t set minimum credit score guidelines. Borrowers with a score of 640 or higher are said to experience a more streamlined loan process. Down payments can be as low as 0%, but, as with an FHA or conventional mortgage, buyers will have to pay PMI if they put down less than 20%.\nPros of USDA Mortgages\n- No minimum credit score to qualify\n- Targeted for low- to mid-income households in rural areas\nCons of USDA Mortgages\n- Income and geographical restrictions\n- Will usually come with PMI, which adds to the monthly mortgage payment\nWhen a USDA Mortgage Might be Best\n- You\u2019re a lower-income buyer interested in buying a home in a qualified area.\n- You have a credit history that makes qualifying for other mortgages difficult.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Loans\nIf you\u2019re active duty or a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, or a family member of one, you might qualify for a mortgage backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. There\u2019s no limit on how much you can borrow, but there are limits to how much of the loan the VA will guarantee\u2014and that determines whether you\u2019ll have to make a down payment.\nVA loans have no down payment requirement as long as you don\u2019t buy a home more expensive than the VA home loan limit and aren\u2019t subject to PMI, which is unlike other mortgage types. Homes purchased using VA loans must be a primary residence for the service member or spouse. Active-duty personnel can use a VA loan to buy a home for a dependent.\nTo get a VA loan, qualified applicants can visit a wide variety of local or online lenders. Anyone applying for a VA loan will have to present a Certificate of Eligibility, or COE. Buyers who qualify should sit down with a mortgage officer at an institution that offers VA-backed loans.\nThere, you can explore the procedures, how much you can borrow and a unique detail called \u201centitlements\u201d\u2014how much of the loan the Department of Veterans Affairs will guarantee.\nPros of VA Mortgages\n- Flexible credit qualification\n- No down payment in most cases and no PMI requirements\nCons of VA Mortgages\n- Limited to active duty, veterans and qualifying family members of the U.S. Armed Forces\n- Must present a COE to prove eligibility\nWhen a VA Mortgage Might be Best\n- You\u2019re active duty, a veteran or a qualifying family member of the U.S. military\n- You\u2019re looking for a low down payment without having to pay PMI\nFor Fixer-Uppers: 203(k) Loans\nIf you\u2019ve got your eye on a fixer-upper home, it\u2019s worth taking a look at a 203(k) loan, guaranteed by the FHA.\nA 203(k) loan lets you take out one loan to cover the purchase of the home and the improvements you need to make. Unlike other types of mortgages, however, 203(k) loans have some specific nuances.\nFirst, any repairs funded by the loan must be completed within six months. Next, you can use the additional proceeds above the purchase price to pay for temporary housing while you or your contractor makes renovations. Finally, 203(k) loans can only be used by individual owners/occupants and qualified nonprofit organizations. You can\u2019t buy a second or investment property with this type of loan.\nWith 203(k)s, funds above the purchase price go into an escrow account. Contractors performing the repairs get paid out of the escrow account. It\u2019s also wise for borrowers to work with contractors who are familiar with the 203(k) process, so there aren\u2019t miscommunications on how to get paid.\nWith 203(k) loans, down payments are as low as 3.5%, yet interest rates trend higher than regular FHA loans. Credit scores are flexible, and buyers must have a minimum score of 500 to qualify. Borrowers also can expect to pay a loan program fee each month with their mortgage.\nThere is also an upfront mortgage insurance premium (MIP) payment required at closing. Your lender can help walk you through closing costs and program fees. The 203(k) loans are available from a variety of local and online lenders.\nPros of 203(k) Loans\n- A single loan to pay for your home and renovations\n- Can help buyers enter a more expensive housing market by renovating a home\nCons of 203(k) Loans\n- The lengthy approval process, which might not work for all housing markets\n- Investment properties don\u2019t qualify\nWhen a 203(k) Mortgage Might be Best\n- You\u2019re interested in buying a fixer-upper\n- You want a lower interest rate than credit cards to pay for home improvements\nWhich Type of Mortgage Is Best for You?\nNow that you have the basics about the different types of mortgages, you can start matching them with your dream home. A savvy next step is to sit down with a mortgage professional and discuss your finances and homeownership goals. Together, you\u2019ll find the best loan\u2014for your needs, your dream home and your specific real estate market."

      "text": "Compare the Best VA Loan Lenders of 2025\nBest VA Mortgage Lenders of 2025: A Closer Look\nForbes Advisor compiled a list of VA loan lenders that excel in various areas, including offering low fees, convenience and flexibility. Lenders\u2019 mortgage rates were based on recent market rates and compared to the national average. The lenders we compiled for this list had a minimum four-star rating.\nFlagstar Bank\nGuaranteed Rate\nNavy Federal Credit Union\nPenFed Credit Union\nPNC\nLoanDepot\nRocket Mortgage\nVeterans United\nGuild Mortgage\nTips for Comparing VA Loans\nVA loans have a number of benefits, including no-down-payment options, lower interest rates than conventional mortgages, lower minimum borrower qualifications and the ability to borrow up to 100% of the home\u2019s value. However, many lenders will institute their own standards. For example, they might apply a minimum credit score\u2014usually in the 580 to 620 range\u2014as well as a minimum debt-to-income ratio and down payment. For borrowers, this means shopping around for lenders that offer VA loans that match your financial needs. Not all lenders offer VA loans, so that\u2019s the first question you need answered when you start comparison shopping. Next, ask what their requirements are (credit score, DTI, down payment) and what interest rates they offer for VA loans. Comparison shopping often leads to lower interest rates, so be sure to collect as much information as you can. You can use a loan estimate from one lender to potentially negotiate a lower rate with another lender. Keep in mind that all VA loans also charge a funding fee. This is a one-time payment which is 2.3% of the total loan amount for first-time VA borrowers and 3.6% for people who have previously used the VA home loan program. VA borrowers who put 5% down can get a discount on this fee and some borrowers are exempt.\nCurrent VA Mortgage Rates\nWhat Is a VA Loan?\nThe mission of the VA home loan program is to assist servicemen, veterans and eligible family members in obtaining, retaining or adapting a home. The VA guarantees millions of loans for existing and newly-constructed homes since the program\u2019s inception. Among other benefits, VA loans allow for veterans to obtain home loans with no down payment. If you are eligible for a VA home loan, you can either work directly with the VA to assist with applying for and managing your loan (VA direct loan) or with a private lender (VA-backed loan).\nHow Does the VA Home Loan Work?\nWith a VA direct loan, the VA acts as your mortgage lender. You\u2019ll apply for your loan through the VA and manage it with them as well. That said, most VA loans are funded through private lenders. In the case of a VA-backed loan, a private lender\u2014not the VA\u2014originates and funds your loan. Lenders follow VA standards\u2014and possibly other standards, depending on the lender\u2014and are guaranteed to recover all or some of their losses from the VA should you go into foreclosure. This gives lenders the incentive to provide competitive interest rates and loan terms. One of the biggest benefits of a VA loan is that you have the option of putting zero money down. Because the VA guarantees the loan, lenders can feel confident about financing VA loans for borrowers who choose to forgo making a down payment.\nTypes of VA Loans\nThere are four main VA-backed home loan types:\n- Purchase loan. If you meet the eligibility requirements, this loan requires no down payment to buy a home and competitive interest rates. You can also borrow up to the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming loan limits.\n- Native American Direct Loan (NADL). This loan provides eligible Native American veterans and their spouses financing to purchase, build or improve a primary residential property on federal trust land. You can also refinance an existing NADL to another NADL to lower your rate.\n- Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL). Veterans can refinance their existing VA loan to a new VA-backed mortgage with a lower interest rate. Also called a \u201cstreamline\u201d refinance, this loan typically helps to lower monthly mortgage payments.\n- Cash-out refinance loan. For veterans who need cash, a cash-out refinance lets borrowers refinance their current mortgage and convert some of their home equity to cash for expenses such as home repairs, college payments and to pay off debts with higher interest rates.\nAdditionally, the VA also offers some specialized VA-backed loans:\n- Energy-Efficient Mortgage (EEM). This loan allows veterans to make energy improvements and updates to their residence, such as installing insulation, upgrading a furnace or adding storm doors. This loan is an \u201cadd-on,\u201d meaning it is combined with another VA-backed purchase loan or refinance.\n- Adapted housing loan. This program provides grants to veterans with service-related impairments who need to build, remodel or adapt a home to accommodate their disabilities.\n- Manufactured home loan. Provides financing for the purchasing of a manufactured home and the land on which the home will be affixed. Eligible veterans can also refinance an existing VA-backed loan on a manufactured home.\nVA Loan Requirements\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy your first home, or you don\u2019t have the funds for a large down payment, a VA loan could be a great option. However, the VA has set some minimum eligibility requirements.\nHow Do You Qualify for a VA Loan?\nServicemembers, veterans and surviving spouses that meet VA criteria are eligible for VA-backed loans. However, lenders require a certificate of eligibility (COE) to prove that borrowers meet VA requirements. You can get a COE through your lender, online or by mail by completing and sending in this form. Here are some of the VA\u2019s requirements:\n- Must be a current or former member of the U.S. military or National Guard or surviving spouse\n- Must meet the minimum length of service requirements, which vary depending on your branch of service and other factors\n- Must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien\n- Must meet the lender's credit and income requirements\n- Must use the property as your primary residence\nAdditionally, you\u2019ll have to meet your lender\u2019s credit and income requirements in order to qualify for a VA loan.\nWhat Is the Minimum Credit Score for VA Loans?\nThe VA does not set minimum credit score requirements in order to qualify for VA loans. However, lenders usually apply their own credit standard for VA loans, which might differ from other loan products they offer.\nWhat Are the Down Payment Requirements for a VA Loan?\nVA-backed loans do not have minimum down payment requirements. However, the less money you put down on a VA-backed loan, the higher the rate you will have to pay on the VA Loan funding fee. The amount of the fee will also depend on whether you have used a VA loan before. See the chart below for VA purchase loans\u2019 funding fee amounts based on down payment.\n| DOWN PAYMENT | FUNDING FEE | |\n|---|---|---|\n| First Time Using VA Loan | Under 5% | 2.3% |\n| 5% or more | 1.65% | |\n| 10% or more | 1.40% | |\n| Repeat VA Loan Borrower | Under 5% | 3.60% |\n| 5% or more | 1.65% | |\n| 10% or more | 1.40% |\nVA Loan Funding Fee\nThough VA-backed loans come with a host of benefits for eligible veterans, they do typically require borrowers to pay what is known as a VA loan funding fee. Required by law, the funding fee helps the VA fund its loan program. The amount of the funding fee varies depending on the loan type, your military category and whether you\u2019re a first-time or repeat home buyer. The most you\u2019ll pay is up to 3.6% of the total loan amount. In many cases, the funding fee applies if you choose to forgo making a down payment. You can choose to roll the funding fee into the total amount of the loan or pay it up front.\nVA Funding Fee Exemptions\nIt\u2019s worth noting that if you pay the funding fee but end up receiving VA compensation for a service-related disability, you may be eligible for a refund as long as the effective date of your compensation is on or before your loan closing date.\nVA Loan Closing Costs\nMost of the closing costs associated with VA loans apply to any type of mortgage, but a couple of the fees are unique and some are capped. Here are some of the closing costs you might encounter when taking out a VA loan:\n- VA funding fee. This fee helps cover the cost of the VA loan program and its government guarantee to lenders. Unless you are exempt, it costs between 1.4% and 3.6% of the loan amount.\n- VA appraisal fee. Like all home appraisals, a VA appraisal makes sure the home is worth at least as much as you\u2019ve agreed to pay for it. What\u2019s unique about this appraisal is that it also makes sure the home meets the VA\u2019s minimum property standards for being safe and sound.\n- Lender fees. On a VA loan, lenders can\u2019t charge more than 1% of the loan amount in fees, including those for loan origination, loan processing, lender appraisals, rate lock, escrow and closing.\n- Title search and insurance. Lenders require borrowers to pay for a professional title report confirming that a thorough search of public records has been performed and the homeowner will have undisputed ownership. They also require title insurance to protect themselves in case something was missed in the title search.\n- Buyer\u2019s inspection. This cost is also optional, but if you\u2019re purchasing a home, it\u2019s a good idea to pay a few hundred dollars for a professional home inspection. The inspector will look for problems with the home\u2019s roof, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, site drainage, and so on\u2014things that could cost you a lot of money to fix.\n- Pest inspection. Lenders usually require a professional pest inspection to make sure the home doesn\u2019t have an infestation or significant damage from wood-destroying insects such as termites or carpenter ants.\n- Recording fees. These are charges imposed by your local government for creating official documents to memorialize who owns the home and who has a lien against it. These documents help to protect your property rights (and the lender\u2019s).\n- Transfer taxes. If you\u2019re buying a home, your local government might charge a transfer tax due to the change of ownership. The fee is usually a percentage of the home\u2019s value and varies significantly by location.\n- Hazard insurance. You must have homeowners insurance and, if required, flood insurance in place before you can close on the home.\nVA Loan Discount Points\nDiscount points are an optional expense you can pay in exchange for a lower interest rate. Points are considered prepaid interest, and one point is equal to one percent of your loan amount, or $1,000 on a $100,000 loan. You can expect an interest rate reduction of perhaps 0.25 percentage points, depending on the lender and market conditions.\nMany types of mortgages allow you to roll points into your mortgage\u2014in other words, to finance them\u2014but VA purchase loans do not. If you want to buy points, you\u2019ll need cash to pay for them at closing. On a VA IRRRL, you may be able to roll up to two points into your loan.\nVA Loans Pros and Cons\n| PROS | CONS |\n|---|---|\n| No down payment required | Must be an eligible service member, veteran or surviving spouse |\n| No private mortgage insurance (PMI) | VA funding fee costs 1.4% to 3.6% of the loan amount unless you\u2019re exempt |\n| Easy to refinance if rates drop | The home must be your primary residence |\nAlternatives to VA Loans\nIf you aren\u2019t sure whether a VA loan is a good choice, comparing it to the alternatives may help:\n- Conventional mortgage. Doesn\u2019t have a funding fee but requires at least 3% down and will usually require PMI until your equity reaches 20%. May be used for a second home or investment property.\n- FHA loan. Doesn\u2019t have a funding fee but does have an upfront mortgage insurance premium as well as monthly mortgage insurance premiums. Requires at least 3.5% down. May be a good choice if your credit score is between 580 and 620.\n- USDA loan. Doesn\u2019t require a down payment but won\u2019t be an option unless you can\u2019t qualify for other loans. There are also income and location restrictions.\nHow To Apply For a VA Home Loan\nBuying a home can be an intricate process and making the commitment to purchase a home through a VA-backed loan is no different. But not to worry. Stay organized and follow this series of steps to help guide you through the VA loan home-buying journey.\n- Apply for your COE. It\u2019s vital that you obtain a Certificate of Eligibility. Lenders require it as evidence that you qualify for a VA loan.\n- Review your finances. Once you are approved for your COE, take a comprehensive look at your financial situation to make sure you are in a good position to buy a home. For instance, understand your credit profile, review all your monthly expenses and determine how much of a mortgage you can afford.\n- Shop for lenders. To get your loan, you will likely need to go through a private lender that provides VA loans\u2014as opposed to the VA\u2014such as a bank, mortgage or credit union. Housing experts state that it\u2019s best to meet with at least three lenders to ensure you\u2019re getting the best deal.\n- Start the prequalification and preapproval process. Prequalifying gives you an estimate of what loan you can qualify for and helps the lender assess your creditworthiness. With a <\nMethodology\nForbes Advisor reviewed 12 mortgage lenders that do business both online and in person throughout the United States.

If you\u2019ve never had a VA loan before or if you\u2019ve completely paid off a previous VA loan and sold the home, you\u2019re eligible to use your full entitlement. If you have an outstanding VA loan, you may have remaining entitlement that you can use to get a second VA loan.\nDo VA loans require PMI?\nVA loans don\u2019t require PMI. Even if you put down 0%, you won\u2019t have to pay any kind of monthly mortgage insurance premiums on a VA loan.\nIf you\u2019re eligible, is a VA loan a better choice than a conventional loan?\nA VA loan can be a better choice than a conventional loan if you don\u2019t want to put any money down and don\u2019t qualify for a down payment assistance program. If you can put down 20% or more, a conventional loan may be a better option because you\u2019ll avoid the VA funding fee."

      "text": "If you\u2019re planning on getting a mortgage to buy a home, keeping an eye on rates is a smart move. Rates can shift daily\u2014sometimes even hourly\u2014and what seems like an insignificant change can ultimately impact your monthly payment and the total interest you\u2019ll pay over time.\nMany buyers are drawn to the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage for its predictable payments and lower interest rates, which can lead to big savings compared to longer-term loans. However, this loan comes with potential drawbacks, namely higher monthly payments, so make sure your budget can handle it.\nCurrent 15-Year Mortgage Rates\nWhat Influences 15-Year Mortgage Rates?\nMultiple factors influence mortgage rates\u2014some are within your control, and others are not.\nExternal factors include Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions, overall economic conditions and the state of the housing market. The direction of the 10-year Treasury yield can also indicate the direction mortgage rates are trending, says Jennifer Bourque, loan officer at All Western and Forbes Advisor advisory board member.\n\u201cIt's not exact, but a good resource and easier to follow,\u201d says Bourque.\nThese broader forces shift daily and affect rates industrywide, regardless of your personal financial profile.\nFactors You Can Control To Get a Better 15-Year Mortgage Rate\nWhere you can make an impact is through personal financial factors, including your credit score.\n\u201cBorrowers want to keep their credit scores as high as possible to ensure they have the lowest possible rate,\u201d says Bourque. \u201cThere are more factors that go into calculating rates, but the easiest to control is their credit score.\u201d\nAdditionally, your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, income stability, employment history and the size of your down payment also come into play.\nFor example, borrowers with a high credit score, low DTI, steady income and job history who put down at least 20% are generally viewed as low-risk and typically receive more favorable mortgage rates.\nHow Have 15-Year Mortgage Rates Changed Over Time?\nRecently, mortgage rates have experienced notable fluctuations.\nBelow is a graph showing the average 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates over the past two years.\nHow Much Can You Save With a 15-Year Mortgage?\nHow much you can save with a 15-year mortgage compared to a longer-term option depends on several key factors. Use the Forbes Advisor 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage calculator for a quick side-by-side look at monthly payments and total interest costs over time.\n15-Year Vs. 30-Year\nMORTGAGE CALCULATOR\n15-year loan summary\nMonthly payment\nTotal cost\n(principal, interest)\n(down payment, principal, interest)\nDown payment\nTotal principal\nTotal interest\nCost per year (excluding down payment, taxes and insurance)\n30-year loan summary\nMonthly payment\nTotal cost\n(principal, interest)\n(down payment, principal, interest)\nDown payment\nTotal principal\nTotal interest\nCost per year (excluding down payment, taxes and insurance)\nDisclaimer: These calculations are based on estimates and may not be exact depending on your lender and personal credit profile.\n15-Year Vs. 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage: What\u2019s the Difference?\nA 15-year mortgage is a great fit for some borrowers, while others may gravitate toward a 30-year loan.\nCheck out these key differences between these loan terms to help you decide which option makes the most sense for you.\n15-Year Mortgage\n- Pay off in 15 years\n- Build home equity faster than longer-term loans\n- Pay less in interest over the life of the loan\n- Typically offers lower interest rates than longer-term loans\n- Usually comes with higher monthly payments\n- Offers less financial flexibility due to higher monthly costs\n30-Year Mortgage\n- Pay off in 30 years\n- Build home equity more slowly than longer-term loans\n- Pay more in interest over the life of the loan\n- Typically has higher interest rates than shorter-term loans\n- Usually has lower monthly payments\n- Offers greater financial flexibility thanks to lower monthly costs\nPros and Cons of a 15-Year Mortgage\nA 15-year mortgage comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages compared to a loan with a longer term.\n| PROS | CONS |\n|---|---|\n| Lower interest rates and shorter terms can lead to significant interest savings | Higher monthly payments than longer terms |\n| Build up home equity faster | Greater default risk due to the larger monthly payment burden |\n| Own your home outright sooner | Harder to qualify, especially for borrowers with tighter budgets |\n| Reducing your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio more quickly can make it easier to refinance at better rates and terms | Reduced cash flow may limit the ability to save, invest or cover unanticipated expenses |\n| Those with poor or limited credit history may face eligibility challenges or may only be approved for smaller loan amounts |\nWhat It Takes To Qualify for a 15\u2011Year Mortgage\nQualifying for a 15-year mortgage is similar to qualifying for a 30-year mortgage. Even so, minimum requirements may vary depending on the mortgage lender.\nHere are the requirements you can expect:\n- Down payment. Some lenders accept as little as 3% down\u2014or even 0%, depending on the loan type. However, the more you put down, the better your chances of scoring a lower interest rate. Also, keep in mind, if your down payment is less than 20%, you\u2019ll likely have to pay private mortgage insurance.\n- Credit score. Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 620 for a conventional 15-year loan. However, depending on the loan program and your financial profile, some may accept scores as low as 500. If you don\u2019t have much credit history, some lenders may consider alternative data, like consistent, on-time rent payments.\n- Debt-to-income ratio. Aim for a DTI ratio of 43% or lower to show lenders you can comfortably manage monthly mortgage payments, though some lenders may accept up to 50%. To calculate your DTI, lenders compare your gross monthly income to your existing monthly debts (such as credit cards, student loan payments and more).\n- Higher gross income. Because monthly payments are higher on a 15-year loan, some lenders may expect a higher income. Many apply the 28% rule, meaning your monthly mortgage payment shouldn't exceed 28% of your gross income.\n- Closing costs. Have enough funds to pay 3% to 6% of the purchase price.\n- Documentation. Expect lenders to require two years of federal tax returns, two years of W-2s, proof of stable income, bank and asset statements, a government-issued photo ID and your Social Security number. Lenders may require additional documentation if you\u2019ve experienced a derogatory credit event, such as a foreclosure or bankruptcy, or if you\u2019re in a lawsuit, to verify the status.\n8 Pro Tips To Get the Lowest Possible 15-Year Mortgage Rate\nMultiple complex factors influence mortgage rates\u2014many of which are out of your control.\nThe good news is that you still have control over several key areas that can help you score a lower rate. By optimizing your financial profile and doing a little research, you\u2019ll boost your chances of locking in a better rate than you might otherwise get.\nBourque also emphasizes the importance of speaking with a trusted mortgage advisor to assess your unique situation and create a strategy for securing the best mortgage rate.\nHere are other tips to help you lower your 15-year rate and save a bundle over the life of your loan.\n- Get your financial house in order: As you\u2019ve likely gathered by now, lenders are interested in a borrower\u2019s financial stability. They want borrowers to have steady employment and income, a solid credit score and a low-to-moderate DTI ratio. Give your credit score a boost before applying by reducing your credit card balances and paying bills on time.\n- Shop multiple lenders: Don\u2019t settle for the first quote. Compare at least three lenders\u2014check out banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers and online lenders\u2014to find the best rates and terms.\n- Consider an online lender: Online lenders sometimes offer lower interest rates than lenders that maintain physical branches, so research some of the best online lender options.\n- Increase your down payment: The more you put down, the lower your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio\u2014which lenders love. If it\u2019s financially possible, making a larger down payment makes you a more attractive, lower-risk borrower and could help you snag a lower rate.\n- Buy discount points: If you can swing the up-front cost and lenders offer the option, purchasing mortgage points can reduce your interest rate. Essentially an up-front interest payment, one mortgage point typically costs 1% of the loan amount and reduces the interest rate by 0.25%. For instance, buying one point on a $200,000 loan at 6.5% would cost $2,000 and lower your rate to 6.25%. However, crunch the numbers to see if you\u2019ll be in the home long enough to make the up-front cost worth it.\n- Ask about a temporary mortgage buy-down: Some lenders allow you to reduce your rate temporarily. In the common 3-2-1 buy-down, borrowers pay a lump sum up-front to reduce their rate by 3% in year one, 2% in year two, and 1% in year three. After that, the interest rate reverts to the original. This approach allows you to ease into higher payments, while also providing some early savings.\n- Monitor rate trends: Though predicting mortgage rate movements is far from an exact science, keeping an eye on key indicators, such as inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, can help you gain some insight on what a good rate is and when to make a move.\n- Lock in a low rate: Once you\u2019ve tracked the market and see a rate you like, don't wait too long. Locking in a mortgage rate can help you save thousands of dollars over your loan term.\nWhen Does a 15\u2011Year Refinance Make Sense?\nRefinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year term can lead to significant interest savings if the timing and conditions are right. Getting a shorter loan term usually means a lower interest rate and you also build equity faster.\nThat said, refinancing isn\u2019t always a slam dunk.\nWhen a Refi Works in Your Favor\nIf you still have at least 20 years left on your 30-year mortgage, refinancing to a 15-year loan could significantly reduce the interest you pay over the life of the loan. That\u2019s especially true if today\u2019s rates are at least 0.75 to 1 percentage point lower than your current rate, a common rule of thumb for when refinancing tends to start making financial sense.\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re already well into your mortgage\u2014say, you have fewer than 10 years to go\u2014refinancing may not benefit you. Specifically, the up-front closing costs and administrative fees could outweigh any interest savings.\nOther Reasons To Consider a 15-Year Refi\nRefinancing can also make sense for personal or lifestyle reasons.\nFor instance, if you're nearing retirement, switching to a 15-year mortgage could mean you're mortgage-free by the time you exit the workforce, providing financial peace of mind when living on a fixed income.\nOn the downside, the shorter mortgage term also means fewer years to take advantage of the mortgage interest tax deduction. So if you rely on that deduction to reduce your annual tax burden, it may be worth factoring that into your decision.\nFind Competitive Mortgage Rates Near You\nCompare lenders and rates with Mortgage Research Center\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nIs the 15-year mortgage rate the same as the APR?\nNo. The 15-year mortgage rate reflects the base borrowing cost. It\u2019s the starting percentage that determines interest charges on your loan. The APR, or annual percentage rate, includes the interest rate and additional costs tied to securing the loan, such as lender fees and other expenses. As a result, the APR is typically a higher rate and offers a more accurate picture of what you\u2019ll pay over time.\nWhat is a \u201cgood\u201d 15-year mortgage rate right now?\nReviewing mortgage rate trends over the past year (or longer) can provide some context for judging whether today\u2019s rates are favorable.\nHowever, keep in mind that the rate lenders offer you may be higher or lower than the average, depending on personal factors like your credit score, DTI ratio, loan type and how much you\u2019re putting down.\nHow low will the 15-year mortgage rate go?\nPredicting how low 15-year mortgage rates will go is tricky, due to the many complex factors influencing rate movements both directly and indirectly. That said, many experts expect rates to ease gradually over time, but not return to the ultralow levels seen during the Covid-19 pandemic."

      "text": "A fixed-rate mortgage is a type of loan that is secured by real estate and has an interest rate that remains unchanged during the mortgage term. These mortgages are ideal for borrowers who want to lock in their interest rate and always know what their monthly payment will be and how much interest they\u2019ll pay over the life of their loan.\nWhat is a Fixed-Rate Mortgage?\nFixed-rate mortgages are one of the most common types of real estate loans, along with adjustable-rate mortgages, which may see interest rate changes over time. Fixed-rate loans charge the same interest rate throughout the loan term. And, as mortgages, these loans are backed by your property, which your lender can seize if you default. Fixed-rate mortgages are common loans for financing both homes and commercial property.\nTo understand a fixed-rate loan, you should know these mortgage loan definitions:\n- Loan amount. How much you borrow.\n- Annual percentage rate. The rate you pay per year on money you borrow. Rates typically start at 2.86% to 3.40%, depending on the loan term.\n- Term. How long your loan lasts.\n- Amortization. The schedule on which your payments are based. Normally this is the same as your loan term, but it could be longer if you have a balloon mortgage, which requires a lump-sum payment at the end of the term..\n- Payment frequency. How often you make a payment\u2014typically monthly.\n- Payment amount. The required monthly or quarterly payment, which is calculated based on other factors (loan amount, rate, term, amortization and number of payments per year).\nHow Fixed-Rate Mortgages Work\nUsing a fixed-rate mortgage starts with a home loan application. Here are the steps:\n- After you decide you need a loan, pick a lender and apply.\n- When you apply, tell the lender you\u2019re interested in a fixed-rate loan.\n- If you qualify, the lender will offer you loan terms, typically 15 or 30 years.\n- Often, when they offer you a fixed-rate loan, lenders do so with multiple rate options\u2014with rates that go down as you pay more upfront to secure your loan.\nOnce you close on your loan, you\u2019ll make regularly scheduled payments (typically monthly). For each payment you make, a portion will cover the interest that accrues between payments, and the remainder will go toward mortgage principal. In the early years of your mortgage, a larger portion of each payment goes toward interest, while, in later payments, most goes toward principal.\nEvery fixed-rate mortgage has a set interest rate, a set payment schedule and a set term. For instance, a home loan might be at 3.75% for 30 years with monthly payments. A commercial property loan might be at 5% for 15 years with quarterly payments. In any event, with a fixed-rate loan, the borrower will know exactly what their payment is for the entire term of the loan.\nIf the loan is fully amortized\u2014meaning you won\u2019t be required to make a lump-sum, or balloon payment, at the end of the term\u2014and your never make an extra payment, you\u2019ll know exactly when the loan will be paid off and how much interest you\u2019ll pay over the life of the loan.\nIf you pay more than is required any given month, any extra money will go directly toward the principal outstanding on your loan. Just be sure to tell your servicer to direct the extra money to your principal. When you make extra payments, you\u2019ll pay off your loan earlier than your term suggests.\nFixed-Rate Mortgage Terms\nFixed-rate mortgages usually last between 10 and 30 years (the most common terms are 10, 15 and 30 years). There are some loans with shorter or longer terms, though longer can be hard to find.\nIf a loan is fully-amortized, then the loan will be repaid at the end of the term. If the loan isn\u2019t fully-amortized, then you may owe a balloon payment at the end of the term if you don\u2019t refinance or make extra payments.\nLonger-term loans usually require lower payments than shorter-term loans because the principal payments are spread out. However, interest rates are usually a little higher for longer-term loans because the odds of default are slightly higher.\nYou may want to get a shorter-term mortgage to:\n- Pay off the loan faster\n- Save money on total interest\n- Qualify for a lower rate\nWhile there can be clear advantages to shorter-term loans, you may want a longer-term loan if you want lower payments. Or, you may want the flexibility to make extra payments each month (when you can) that count directly against your loan principal.\nTypes of Fixed-Rate Mortgages\nIn addition to different terms, there are also different types of fixed-rate mortgages. For example, you can get a fixed-rate mortgage for both residential and commercial property, though they have different interest rates and terms.\nMost loans are fully-amortized and will be paid off at the end of the term, though there are also balloon loans that will require a lump-sum payment at the end of the term. You may also refinance to avoid a balloon payment.\nFixed-rate loans may also be classified as private loans or government-insured loans, such as those backed by the Federal Housing Administration or the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nFor residential loans, you can apply for conforming loans\u2014those that fall within federal guidelines that allow government-backed entities to purchase the loans and sell them to investors\u2014and nonconforming loans, including jumbo loans that are for amounts that exceed the limit for conforming loans.\nWhen to Use a Fixed-Rate Mortgage\nA fixed-rate loan may be your best option when:\n- You want to lock in a low interest rate\n- You want to know how much interest you\u2019ll pay over the life of your loan\n- You don\u2019t want to have to worry about refinancing later\nBut using a fixed-rate loan isn\u2019t always an option. If you have questionable credit or can only only afford a small down payment, you may not be able to qualify for a fixed-rate mortgage. If a fixed-rate mortgage isn\u2019t an option\u2014or if you can qualify for a loan with a higher rate\u2014then you may want to consider another type of mortgage.\nFixed-Rate Mortgages Vs. Adjustable-Rate Mortgages\nInterest rates for fixed-rate mortgages are constant for the entire term of a loan. An adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, on the other hand, has an introductory rate that remains constant for the first several years of a mortgage (typically five, seven or 10 years).\nAfter the introductory period expires, an ARM\u2019s interest rate changes based on an underlying index, like the prime rate. Then, the rate changes again periodically after the first adjustment\u2014usually every year.\nIn addition to ARMs, some lenders also offer variable rate loans. These loans are never set\u2014they fluctuate (or float) from month to month based on an underlying rate like the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or prime rate.\nFixed-Rate Mortgage Benefits\n- Your rate can\u2019t increase like on an ARM\n- You don\u2019t have to worry about affording your payment when rates adjust\n- You don\u2019t need to refinance\n- Prepayment penalties are rarer with fixed-rate than ARMs\nFixed-Rate Mortgage Drawbacks\n- Rates can\u2019t go down like ARM rates sometimes can\n- Fixed rates are often higher than introductory rates for ARMs\n- Loans are secured by your property, so you can lose the property if you default on payments\n- You may have to pay money upfront to secure the best rates"

      "text": "After reaching a peak of 7.04% in January 2025, mortgage rates retreated to the mid-6% range in March but then reversed course and have remained stuck in the 6.7% to 6.9% range since early May.\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.72% the last week of July, an increase of 5 basis points since the beginning of the month, according to Freddie Mac data. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.\nMortgage rates could stay elevated\u2014or even rise\u2014if President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies end up fueling inflation. Indeed, the Federal Reserve continues to delay cutting its key interest rate as it monitors inflation data. Consequently, many housing market analysts foresee mortgage rates only gradually easing by the end of 2025, if at all.\nFed Keeps Rates Unchanged for Fifth Consecutive Time\nIn a widely anticipated move, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\u2014the Federal Reserve panel charged with setting interest rates\u2014voted to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at its July two-day meeting. The federal funds rate is the overnight borrowing rate for commercial banks and credit unions and indirectly influences mortgage rates.\nHowever, there was a surprise twist: only nine members voted to hold rates steady, while two, Fed Vice Chair of Supervision Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller, dissented, voting for a quarter point cut. Dissents at the consensus-driven Fed are rare. The last time multiple governors voted against a decision was in 1993.\nThis decision maintains the 4.25% to 4.5% target range and marks the fifth consecutive meeting in which policymakers voted to hold the rate steady.\nAfter holding rates between 5.25% and 5.5% between July 2023 and August 2024, the Fed implemented three rate cuts between September and December 2024, totaling one percentage point. The committee has held rates steady since then, as it waits for clearer signs of how tariffs are impacting inflation.\nWhat This Means for Mortgage Rates and Home Affordability\nAs the Fed began raising rates in March 2022 to wrestle runaway inflation down to its 2% target, the housing market felt the squeeze. Mortgage rates surged to decades-high levels as home prices hit historic peaks amid fierce demand and scant inventory, shutting the door on many would-be buyers.\nNevertheless, the Fed\u2019s influence on home affordability is limited.\n\u201cOn housing affordability, Powell said the housing market is a special case, shaped by a long-term shortage and years of underbuilding,\u201d said Sam Williamson, senior economist at First American, in emailed commentary. \u201cWhile the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, the best contribution it can make is to maintain 2% inflation and maximum employment\u2014creating the stable economic backdrop needed to support housing over time.\u201d\nFed rate decisions aside, Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow Home Loans, said in emailed commentary that affordability challenges will remain, at least for the near future.\n\u201cExpect the housing market to remain stuck,\u201d Ng said. \u201cEven if mortgage rates edge slightly lower by late 2025, it won\u2019t significantly alleviate affordability pressures faced by the typical household.\u201d\nShould Buyers Wait for Rates To Fall?\nSome experts caution that waiting for mortgage rates to drop further can be a risky strategy.\n\u201cFor aspiring home buyers, the right time to buy really depends on your individual goals and financial situation,\u201d says Fred Bolstad, head of retail home lending at U.S. Bank. \u201cIf you are in the financial position to afford the payments on a home you find and love, there is no need to wait.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nThe next two-day FOMC meeting is set for September 16 and 17. In addition to its interest decision, the committee will release its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which will provide an updated outlook on key economic indicators, including GDP growth, inflation and unemployment, as well as interest rate projections for the near and longer term.\nSo, will the Fed finally resume rate cuts at its September policy gathering?\nWhile Powell emphasized in a post-meeting press conference that the committee will continue to follow inflation and labor market data to help guide its September rate decision, the two rare dissenting votes sent a potential signal that a rate cut could be on the table if more members align with this view.\nFollowing the July meeting, odds of a September rate pause were roughly 3-to-2, with about 60% of Fed watchers expecting the central bank to keep rates the same and around 40% anticipating a quarter-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool, a gauge that tracks market expectations for Fed policy rate decisions. These probabilities will likely shift as new data emerges and the meeting draws closer.\nThe rate you\u2019re offered on a mortgage will also depend on the lender you work with, its business costs and your financial profile. Ultimately, if you\u2019re looking for a home loan, compare your options with multiple mortgage lenders to find a good deal.\nMortgage Rate Predictions for 2025 and 2026\nHere\u2019s how some experts predict market conditions will affect the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the third quarter of 2025 and beyond.\nNational Association of Home Builders (NAHB): 30-year fixed rate will average in the mid-6% range by the end of 2025\nIn his analysis of key data from the April Macro Economic Outlook\u2014which remained the most current report as of July\u2014Eric Lynch, economist at NAHB, offered this prediction: \u201cAs of April 10, the current Freddie Mac 30-year fixed-rate mortgage sits at 6.62%. While it will not be smooth, NAHB anticipates the 30-year mortgage rate to average around this rate by the end of 2025, and just above 6% by the end of 2026.\u201d\nNational Association of Realtors (NAR): Rates will average 6.7% in the second half of 2025 and 6% in 2026\nNAR updated its mortgage rate forecast for the remainder of 2025, expecting mortgage rates to average 6.7%, up from a previously forecasted 6.4%, but upgraded its expectations for 2026, predicting mortgage rates will hit average 6%, down from 6.1%.\u201cThree percent, 4%, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, during the trade association\u2019s mid-year real estate forecast summit. \u201cBut 6% is very likely with the Federal Reserve ready to cut interest rates, you know, two, three, four, or even six rounds of rate cuts over the next twelve months, so I think the mortgage rate could go down.\u201d\nZillow Home Loans: Mortgage rates will remain in mid-6% range through 2025\n\u201cZillow forecasts mortgage rates will remain near the mid-6% range through the end of 2025,\u201d Ng wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cMortgage rates continue to fluctuate with daily economic news, yet they've remained largely confined within the 6%-7% range over the past year. This persistent range reflects an ongoing tug of war: signals of a gradually cooling economy put downward pressure on rates, while stubborn inflation keeps them elevated.\u201d\nFannie Mae: Revises mortgage rate forecast downward\nPer Fannie Mae's July Economic and Housing Outlook: \u201cWe forecast mortgage rates to end 2025 and 2026 at 6.4% and 6%, respectively, down from 6.5% and 6.1% in our prior forecast.\u201d\nFreddie Mac: Expect rates to remain high in 2025\nAccording to its January Economic, Housing and Mortgage Market Outlook, the only report published in 2025 as of July, Freddie Mac expects mortgage rates to stay \u201chigher for longer\u201d this year, with the slightly lower rates (compared to 2024) leading to a boost in refinance volume.\nMortgage Bankers Association (MBA): Rates will average 6.8% in the third quarter and recede slightly by the end of the year\nAccording to the MBA\u2019s July Mortgage Finance Forecast, the real estate finance association maintained its average quarterly mortgage rate projections from last month. The trade association predicts the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to average 6.8% in the third quarter of 2025 and end the year at 6.7%. The MBA expects an average rate of 6.6% in the first quarter of 2026.\nBOK Financial: Expecting rates to stay high in the coming months\n\u201cBased on recent inflation concerns across the economy, the Federal Reserve does not sound interested in rate cuts anytime soon,\u201d says Michael Merritt, senior vice president of customer care and default mortgage servicing at BOK Financial and Forbes Advisor advisory board member. \u201cAs such, I expect rates to stay in the [high-6% to low-7%] range over the next few months\u2014a similar range they have moved over the last month.\u201d\nJome: Mortgage rate movement will depend on Fed, economy\n\u201cWhen it comes to mortgage rates and inflation, beyond the usual impact of monetary policy and natural inflation trends, we may see additional inflationary pressure from potential tariffs on major trading partners,\u201d said Dan Hnatkovskyy, economist, housing market expert and CEO of Jome, a real estate company specializing in new construction home transactions. \u201cThis type of inflation could likely cause the Fed to pause rate cuts. \u2026 [B]ased on current trends and historical patterns, it seems unlikely that we\u2019ll see significant declines in Fed rates or mortgage rates this year, given the added inflationary pressures.\u201d\nFirst American Financial Corporation: Elevated rates are staying put for a while\n\u201cA 'higher-for-longer' mortgage rate environment will continue to dampen house-buying power,\u201d says Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American.\nBright MLS: Mortgage rates will remain elevated in 2025\n\u201cHigher rates are also keeping many homeowners from selling their home, as they are reluctant to trade in their very low mortgage rate for a much higher one,\u201d said Bright MLS Chief Economist Lisa Sturtevant, in recent commentary. \u201cAs home prices soften, sellers are going to be further reticent to sell because they are less likely to get the price they want for their home. What does this mean for the housing market in the second half of 2025? It is likely going to continue to be a slow market. Mortgage rates will remain in the mid- to high-6% range.\u201d\nJ.P. Morgan: Mortgage rates will remain above 6.5% in 2025\nAccording to financial services firm J.P. Morgan\u2019s February outlook for the U.S. housing market in 2025, \u201cThe higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop is here to stay, with mortgage rates expected to ease only slightly to 6.7% by the year end.\u201d\nWells Fargo: Federal funds rate cuts may offer modest mortgage rate relief\n\u201cWhile reductions in the federal funds rate should allow for additional mortgage rate relief later this year, we currently do not anticipate mortgage rates to recede below 6.5%,\u201d according to Wells Fargo in a recent report.\nRedfin: Mortgage rates will stay in the upper 6% range\nReal estate brokerage Redfin, a subsidiary of Rocket Companies, expects home prices to decline 1% year over year nationwide by the end of 2025, and mortgage rates to remain essentially unchanged in the 6.8% range.\nCurrent Mortgage Rate Trends\nMany industry experts forecasted last summer that rates would be in the mid-6% range by the end of 2024 and at around 6.25% by now.\nMeanwhile, an average 30-year fixed mortgage rate of 6.25% is nowhere in sight.\nHere\u2019s how rates have trended over the past five years for 15- and 30-year mortgages.\nRefinancing 2025: Act Now or Wait for Better Rates Next Year?\nTo evaluate whether or not a refinance would be realistic, you want to evaluate your reasoning. If the goal is debt consolidation, it could make sense, but if you\u2019re trying to reduce the payment, it could be more challenging to achieve in the current higher-rate environment. The only way to know for sure is to speak with a mortgage lender to explore your options.\n\u2014 Jenn Bourque, loan officer at Empire Home Loans and Forbes Advisor advisory board member\nAs far as waiting for better rates next year, most experts say it\u2019s risky to try to time the market.\nWhether 2025 is the right time for you to refinance depends on several factors, including the mortgage rate you got when you initially financed your home and how long you plan to stay in the home. Refinancing comes with closing costs, just like your original mortgage, so you want to make sure you\u2019re in the home long enough to recoup those costs and start saving on the lower refinance rate.\nThe number of times the Fed cuts interest rates and by how much may have some influence on mortgage rates, so monitoring the news can help you monitor trends. Refinance rates tend to be higher than purchase rates, but the two typically move in tandem.\nIf you must refinance when refinance rates are high, you still have options to reduce the rate.\n\u201cSome lenders offer \u2018float-down\u2019 options, which let you lock in a rate but improve it if market rates drop before close, says Tony Julianelle, CEO of Atlas Real Estate. \u201cIt\u2019s not free, but in a volatile rate environment, it can be worth the marginal cost.\u201d\nShould You Refinance If You Already Have a Good Rate?\nOver 40% of U.S. mortgages were originated in 2020 and 2021, when interest rates were at record lows. There were also some 14 million mortgage refinances during the same time.\nIf you were lucky enough to secure a mortgage during that period, 2025 may not be the ideal time to refinance, considering mortgage rates could stay well above 6% in the coming months.\n\u201cMost homeowners refinance to reduce their monthly mortgage payments with a lower interest rate,\u201d wrote Archana Pradhan, an economist at CoreLogic, in a recent report. Pradhan adds that only about 12% of mortgage loans have a rate of 6% or more, many of which were originated in 2023 and 2024.\nRecent Refinance Trends\nRefinance activity in July trended into negative territory week over week but remained strong compared to the same period a year ago, when mortgage rates were slightly higher.\nMortgage rates have remained well above 6.5% for most of 2025, leaving refinancing off the table for most, except for those with rates north of 7%. Another postponed Fed rate cut could indirectly maintain upward pressure on mortgage rates, impacting refinance demand.\nHere are recent trends in refinance activity, according to the MBA\u2019s Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey.\n| 2025 REFINANCE ACTIVITY | WEEKLY | ANNUALLY |\n|---|---|---|\n| Week ending July 4 | +9% | +56% |\n| Week ending July 11 | -7% | +25% |\n| Week ending July 18 | -3% | +22% |\n| Week ending July 25 | -1% | +30% |\n\u201cMortgage applications fell to their lowest level since May, with both purchase and refinance activity declining over the week,\u201d said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in emailed commentary. \u201cThere is still plenty of uncertainty surrounding the economy and job market, which is weighing on prospective homebuyers\u2019 decisions.\u201d\nRefinancing your mortgage can be a good financial move if you can qualify for a lower rate and shorten your loan term. Due to closing costs and fees associated with refinancing, many mortgage experts say refinancing makes sense only if you can reduce your current rate by at least 1%. Some strategies that could help whittle down your refinance rate include comparing rates from at least three refinance lenders, asking lenders about reducing closing costs, working to build your credit score, choosing a loan with a shorter term or buying discount points.\nHow To Shop for the Best Mortgage Rate\nRather than waiting it out for a rate that they like better, hopeful homebuyers should assess their personal financial situation\u2014if the house is right for them, and the upfront and monthly payments are affordable, it could be the right chance to make a move.\n\u2013 Matt Vernon, head of retail lending, Bank of America\nGetting an optimal rate on a home loan can save you a significant amount of money over time. Here are some tips that can help you get the best rate possible for your situation:\n- Keep your eye on rates. Mortgage rates are constantly changing. Keeping a close watch will make it easier to find and lock in a better rate.\n- Check your credit. When you apply for a mortgage, the lender will review your credit to determine your creditworthiness as well as your interest rate. In general, the higher your credit score, the better your rate will be. To get an idea of where you stand, check your credit before you apply and dispute any errors with the appropriate credit bureau to potentially boost your score.\n- Shop around and compare lenders. Consider options from as many mortgage lenders as possible to find the best deal for you. Prospective buyers have saved more than $1,500 over a loan\u2019s term by getting two quotes from lenders and saved roughly $3,000 when they sought five quotes, according to Freddie Mac.\nFind Competitive Mortgage Rates Near You\nCompare lenders and rates with Mortgage Research Center\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat\u2019s the difference between mortgage interest rates and APR?\nWhile the terms \u201cinterest rate\u201d and \u201cannual percentage rate (APR)\u201d are often used interchangeably, they\u2019re not the same. A mortgage interest rate reflects the cost you pay to the lender in return for borrowing money on top of your loan amount.\nThe APR on a mortgage, on the other hand, includes the interest and any other fees or penalties associated with the loan. Because of this, the APR can give you a better idea of how much you\u2019ll pay on a mortgage compared to just the interest rate.\nWhat is a mortgage rate lock?\nA mortgage rate lock is a guarantee that the rate you\u2019re offered in your mortgage application acceptance is the one you will eventually pay, assuming you close within a normal period of time and make no changes to your application.\nIn a period of rising or volatile interest rates\u2014like the present one\u2014it may be wise to lock in a rate that seems affordable for you.\nWhen should I lock my mortgage rate?\nIt can be tricky to time any market, and mortgage rates are no exception. If conditions are choppy and interest rates are likely to rise, it may be smart to lock in a rate that works with your budget and seems fair to you.\nBe sure to ask your lender about the consequences of not closing within the time frame specified in a rate lock agreement and also about what could happen if rates fall after you lock in a rate.\nHow do you calculate your mortgage payment?\nDepending on your loan type and other factors, the components of a monthly payment can vary but typically include:\n- Principal. The amount of funds you borrow from a lender for your mortgage.\n- Interest. The cost the lender charges you for borrowing the funds.\n- Property taxes. Payments are based on local property tax rates.\n- Homeowners insurance. A separate policy for insurance coverage based on the value of your home and property.\n- Private mortgage insurance (PMI). Typically only applies if you take out a conventional mortgage with a down payment below 20% of the purchase price.\n- Homeowners association (HOA) or condominium fees. Only applies if your property is part of an HOA or you own a condominium.\n- Escrow. An account reserved for property taxes, homeowners insurance and mortgage insurance, managed by the lender.\n- Additional costs. Examples of potential additional costs include home warranties and flood insurance.\nAlong with the above information, plug in the home price, down payment, interest rate and loan term into a mortgage calculator to determine the most accurate monthly mortgage payment estimate.\nWhat is the mortgage rate forecast for the next five years?\nGiven the many factors directly and indirectly impacting mortgage rates, predicting where rates will go in the years ahead is tricky.\n\u201cFive-year mortgage rates is a very hard trend to predict as there are a lot of variables that could impact the result,\u201d says Schulman. \u201cIn the next 18 to 24 months, we see further reductions in rates so long as the economy continues to improve.\u201d"

We\u2019re likely to see mortgage rates in the high 6% range well into the spring.\u201d\n- William Raveis Mortgage regional vice president Melissa Cohn. \u201cMortgage rates look to be rangebound in the next couple of months as inflation remains sticky and the impact of President Trump\u2019s policies is still unclear.\u201d\n- First American deputy chief economist Odeta Kushi. \u201cWith the Federal Reserve on hold and inflation proving sticky, longer-term rates, including mortgage rates, are expected to remain elevated within a narrow range. If inflation eases and the Fed begins cutting rates, mortgage rates could steadily retreat.\u201d\n- Zillow Home Loans senior economist Kara Ng. \u201cI expect mortgage rates to decline slightly by the end of the year, though likely not enough to provide significant relief for borrowers, and the path down may be bumpy. The future of mortgage rates remains uncertain, as it will depend on new information and how the markets interpret it.\u201d\nForbes Advisor's Insight on Current Mortgage Rates and the Housing Market\nRates will likely continue a slow downward trend through 2025. It\u2019s unclear, and a little too early to tell, how the Trump administration\u2019s policies will affect interest rates and the broader economy. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach, so we may see a rise in mortgage rates if tariffs impact inflation. Potential home buyers will be in a tight spot for the foreseeable future, though, as home prices will remain elevated this year and new construction continues to lag behind.\nSome buyers may need to move further away from higher-priced cities into more affordable metros to cut costs and buy a home sooner rather than later. For others, this could mean downsizing, foregoing amenities or important contingencies like a home inspection. However, be careful about giving up contingencies because it could cost more in the long run if the house has major problems that weren\u2019t fixed upon inspection.\nBuyers should also consider how long they\u2019re staying in a home before buying. People buying their \u201cforever home\u201d have less to fear if the market reverses, as they can ride the wave of ups and downs. However, buyers planning to move in a few years will have more risk to consider if the market plummets. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to shop at the outset for a real estate agent and lender who are experienced housing experts in your market of interest and who you trust to give sound advice. It\u2019s also essential to compare rates and terms among the best mortgage lenders to find a deal that fits your unique situation.\nHow To Compare Current Mortgage Rates\nComparison shopping often leads to finding the lowest rates when planning to purchase a new home or refinance an existing loan. Here's how to compare current mortgage rates and find the best fit for your financial situation:\n- 1. Compare rates and different lender offerings online. Be sure to look at the APR, not just the interest rate. The APR reflects the total cost of your loan on an annual basis and any discount points being charged. Pay attention to the fine print on the websites to see how those rates are determined.\n- 2. Evaluate online vs. physical lenders. Applying for a mortgage on your own is straightforward, and most lenders offer online applications. Online lenders may also offer lower rates and fewer fees than some brick-and-mortar lenders, so consider this when comparing current mortgage rates.\n- 3. Consider working with a mortgage broker. Mortgage brokers have access to a wide range of loan products and can help you shop for rates based on your qualifications. Working with a broker doesn\u2019t guarantee savings, but it\u2019s a great way to evaluate your options.\n- 4. Apply for a mortgage through various lenders. Regardless of whether you work with a mortgage broker, shopping for a mortgage can help you secure the most competitive rate. Applying for multiple mortgages in a short period of time won\u2019t affect your credit score as each application is counted as one query within a 45-day window.\nHow Today's Interest Rates Affect Your Monthly Payments\nIf you know how much you\u2019re borrowing, what type of loan you\u2019re getting and how many years you have to pay it back, you can use a mortgage calculator to check your monthly payment at different interest rates.\nFor instance, if you have a starting loan balance of $425,000 on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, here\u2019s approximately what you can expect to pay in principal and interest every month, excluding taxes, mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance and HOA fees:\n- At a 5% interest rate. $2,281 in monthly payments (excluding taxes, mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance and HOA fees)\n- At a 6% interest rate. $2,548 in monthly payments (excluding taxes, mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance and HOA fees)\n- At a 7% interest rate. $2,828 in monthly payments (excluding taxes, mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance and HOA fees)\n- At an 8% interest rate. $3,119 in monthly payments (excluding taxes, mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance and HOA fees)\nHow To Get the Best Mortgage Rate Today\nThough lenders decide your mortgage rate, there are some proactive steps you can take to ensure the best rate possible. For example, advanced preparation and meeting with multiple lenders can go a long way. Even lowering your rate by a few basis points can save you money in the long run.\nHere are some other ways you can improve your chances of getting the best deal:\n- Take stock of your financial situation. Before you fall in love with your dream home, make sure you can afford the monthly payments and other homeownership costs. Start by looking at your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio\u2014your total monthly debts against your monthly earnings\u2014to determine how much home you can afford.\n- Review your credit score. Lenders look at your credit score to evaluate the risk you pose as a borrower. A higher score gives you a better chance of scoring favorable mortgage terms. Paying down balances, not applying for new credit cards and loans and checking your credit report for errors can all improve your score.\n- Meet with several lenders. You don\u2019t have to go with the first lender quote you receive. You can shop around to find the best loan to fit your needs. Research various mortgage lenders and different loans you might qualify for to put yourself in a stronger position once you are ready to buy a home.\n- Crunch the numbers with a mortgage calculator. Once you know which type of loan you qualify for, you can estimate your monthly payments by punching your numbers into various mortgage calculators, such as a 30-year fixed mortgage calculator or mortgage amortization calculator.\n- Save money. The more you put down on a home, the less you\u2019ll need to borrow from a lender. This means lower monthly payments and more interest savings over the life of the loan.\nWhat Affects Current Mortgage Rates?\n- Federal Reserve monetary policy. The Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy indirectly influences mortgage rates. When the central bank raises the federal funds target rate, it has a knock-on effect by raising short-term interest rates. In turn, interest rates for home loans tend to increase as lenders pass on the higher borrowing costs to consumers.\n- Lenders. A lender with physical locations and a lot of overhead may charge higher interest rates to cover operating costs and make a profit. On the other hand, online lenders tend to offer lower mortgage rates because they have less fixed costs to cover.\n- Credit score. Your credit profile also impacts the mortgage rate you\u2019re offered. Borrowers with a strong credit history and good score (at least 670) usually receive a lower interest rate. High-risk borrowers with a poor credit score, on the other hand, typically receive higher interest rates.\nFind Competitive Mortgage Rates Near You\nCompare lenders and rates with Mortgage Research Center\nWhen applying for a mortgage, you must show that you're financially stable, so avoid quitting or changing your job\u2014unless it's for a higher salary\u2014right before or during your application process. Otherwise, lenders may regard your situation as too unstable to afford the monthly payments and deny you a loan. Talk to your lender before making any changes.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat\u2019s the difference between APR and interest rate?\nThe interest rate is the cost of borrowing money whereas the APR is the yearly cost of borrowing as well as the lender fees and other expenses associated with getting a mortgage.\nThe APR is the total cost of your loan, which is the best number to look at when you\u2019re comparing rate quotes. Some lenders might offer a lower interest rate but their fees are higher than other lenders (with higher rates and lower fees), so you\u2019ll want to compare APR, not just the interest rate. In some cases, the fees can be high enough to cancel out the savings of a low rate.\nWhen will mortgage rates go down?\nExperts say rates may gradually decrease over the course of 2025, but this depends mainly on inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions.\nWhy are mortgage rates so high?\nMortgage rates are high due to several economic factors. Supply chain shortages related to the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine caused inflation to shoot up in 2021 and 2022. A resilient economy and robust job market also increase inflation and mortgage demand.\nWhen inflation increases, the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its interest rate target for overnight lending between banks, and interest rates throughout the financial sector typically follow suit. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed raised its policy rate 11 times, leading to a surge in mortgage rates. After a few rate cuts in late 2024, the Fed has indicated it isn\u2019t certain there will be cuts in 2025. This means we can expect mortgage rates to remain around the same levels for now.\nWhen should you lock in your mortgage rate?\nYou should lock in your mortgage rate once you find a rate that fits your budget, especially when mortgage rates are predicted to increase. While it\u2019s uncertain whether a rate will go up or down between weeks, closing your loan can sometimes take several weeks to months.\nIf you don\u2019t lock in your rate, rising interest rates could force you to make a higher down payment or pay points on your closing agreement to lower your interest rate costs.\nWhat are points on a mortgage rate?\nMortgage points represent a percentage of an underlying loan amount\u2014one point equals 1% of the loan amount. Mortgage points are a way for the borrower to lower their interest rate on the mortgage by buying points down when they\u2019re initially offered the mortgage.\nFor example, by paying upfront 1% of the total interest to be charged over the life of a loan, borrowers can typically unlock mortgage rates that are about 0.25% lower.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that buying points does not help you build equity in a property\u2014you simply save money on interest."

      "text": "The personal consumption expenditures price index, commonly known as the PCE price index, is one of the main measures of inflation and consumer spending in the U.S. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes the PCE price index each month to track spending and inflation.\nWhat Is the PCE Price Index?\nPrices for goods and services change constantly, rising and falling as companies and consumers react to trends in the economy. When you measure these price changes across an entire economy, that\u2019s the rate of inflation.\nThe PCE price index looks at U.S. inflation by measuring changes in the cost of living for households. It tracks the prices of a basket of goods and services, each with different weightings, to reflect how much a typical household spends every month.\nThe weightings are important. Say the price of gasoline rises in a given month but the price of tomatoes falls. Gasoline represents a larger portion of a family\u2019s monthly budget, so it\u2019s weighted more heavily in calculating PCE. That means rising gas prices have a bigger impact on the overall index than cheaper tomatoes.\nThere are three key measures of U.S. inflation, the PCE price index, the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI). PCE is notable for a few reasons:\n- The PCE price index is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of prices in the U.S., so it plays an outsized role in setting interest rate policy.\n- Price data for the index comes from surveys of businesses, rather than what consumers say they\u2019re spending. This choice ensures PCE captures expenditures that are made on behalf of consumers, like health insurance paid for by employers or government assistance programs.\n- The basket of goods and services that backs up PCE changes regularly to account for substitution. When prices for one item rise, consumers shift their spending to cheaper alternatives, and the basket reflects those changes.\nThe Latest PCE Inflation Data\nThe most recent PCE price index data was released on May 31, covering the month of April. The headline April PCE inflation figure was +2.7% year over year, unchanged from the annual rate of +2.7% in March. Although there was no change, generally, PCE inflation has been trending downward since the most recent peak rate of +6.8% in June 2022.\nAnnual core PCE inflation in April also remained unchanged from March\u2019s adjusted reading of +2.8% year over year. The Fed uses the core PCE price index as its preferred measure of U.S. inflation.\nHow Is PCE Inflation Calculated?\nThe PCE index is calculated each month based on BEA data on personal consumption expenditures from a wide range of sources including:\n- Statistical reports from the U.S. Census Bureau and other government agencies\n- Administrative and regulatory agency reports\n- Reports from private organizations, such as trade associations\nIn its analysis, the BEA separates consumer goods and consumer services into three categories:\n- Durable goods. Items that last three years or longer, like cars and trucks, furnishings and household equipment, recreational goods and vehicles\n- Non-durable goods. Items that last less than three years, like food and beverages, clothing, gasoline and other energy products\n- Services. Things like housing, health care, transportation, recreation services, restaurants, accommodations, financial services and insurance\nThe PCE inflation rate is calculated by adding up the dollar amounts of all goods and services in a basket of goods and services, comparing the total to the prior month\u2019s figures. Some prices must be adjusted based on estimates because the data needed for calculation is only compiled quarterly, whereas PCE inflation is released monthly.\nAll consumption expenditures data are totaled at the dollar values seen in the various surveys and statistical reports noted above, and then adjusted to current dollar values based on seasonal adjustments and various monthly price indexes.\nThe BEA normalizes the data via a price deflator\u2014a ratio of the value of all goods and services produced in a particular year at current prices to that of prices that prevailed during a base year\u2014to get the monthly PCE index: the average monthly rate of inflation (or deflation) for the U.S. economy as a whole.\nCore Inflation vs. Headline Inflation\nInflation numbers are generally released in pairs: headline inflation and core inflation. Headline inflation accounts for every good or service included in an index; core inflation excludes food and energy prices as these are very volatile and can change substantially frequently.\nThis happens for a few reasons, such as when market participants speculate on energy and food and commodity futures. Because this isn\u2019t based on real consumer supply and demand, it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect inflation in the real economy. That\u2019s why economists often turn to core measures of inflation instead, which rise much more stably.\nCore PCE and the Federal Reserve\nCore PCE inflation plays an important role in the U.S. financial system because the Federal Reserve references it to gauge U.S. inflation when setting monetary policy.\nIn January 2012 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted PCE as its primary measure of inflation over CPI, another leading measure of consumer inflation. The FOMC did so for a few main reasons:\n- PCE adjusts its basket weights as people substitute more expensive goods and services for less expensive ones.\n- PCE includes more comprehensive coverage of goods and services.\n- Historical PCE data can be revised.\nPCE vs CPI: What\u2019s the Difference?\nCPI and the PCE index both measure U.S. inflation in similar but ultimately different ways.\n- Both measure changes in a basket of goods and services, but the CPI is based on survey data from tens of thousands of consumers instead of reports from businesses on what they sell.\n- CPI doesn\u2019t account for substitution or costs paid by others that consumers benefit from, like employer-sponsored medical costs, making PCE more comprehensive, less volatile and more accurate.\n- CPI is not revised once it\u2019s been published. That\u2019s because the CPI has been calculated using changing methodologies over time, preventing the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from refactoring historical CPI figures. When the methods for calculating PCE are revised, they are applied to historical data as well.\n- CPI tends to show higher rates of inflation than the PCE index. From January 1995 to May 2013, the average rate of headline CPI inflation was 2.4% whereas headline PCE inflation was 2.0%. Setting both indexes equal to 100 in 1995, CPI inflation was more than 7% higher than the PCE index in May 2013.\n- Even more recently there is still a big gap between the two benchmarks. Annual CPI inflation clocked in at 3.5% in March 2024 and 3.2% in February. That\u2019s faster than the March PCE pace of 2.7% and 2.5% in February."

      "text": "Compare the Best FHA Loan Lenders of 2025\nBest FHA Loan Lenders of 2025: A Closer Look\nPNC Bank\nRate\nMr. Cooper\nGuild Mortgage\nNew American Funding\nBetter Mortgage\nWhat Is an FHA Loan?\nEstablished by Congress in 1934 amid the Great Depression, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\u2014part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\u2014was created to help expand homeownership by facilitating access to affordable financing.\nDespite the name, FHA loans aren\u2019t funded by the government. Instead, the FHA insures loans issued by approved lenders. This federal backing means that if a borrower defaults, the FHA reimburses the lender for part of its losses. With that guarantee in place, lenders are more inclined to approve higher-risk applicants, broadening access to homeownership. Case in point? Over 80% of FHA loans in 2024 were issued to first-time buyers, according to HUD.\nHow Do FHA Loans Work?\nFHA loan borrowers pay an upfront fee and annual mortgage insurance premiums (MIP), which fund the loan guarantee program. If you put down 10% or less on the home, you must pay the annual premium for the full loan term. If your FHA down payment exceeds 10%, you pay the upfront fee plus the premiums for 11 years or until the loan term ends, whichever comes first.\nThe FHA typically requires borrowers to occupy the home within 60 days of closing and use it as their primary residence, with the intention of living there for at least one year.\nFHA loans are particularly popular with first-time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income borrowers who may not qualify for conventional loans, thanks to flexible credit requirements, low down payment options and competitive mortgage rates.\nFHA Loan Limits\nFHA loan limits cap how much you can borrow with an FHA-backed mortgage.\nThese limits are tied to the conforming loan limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and are updated annually.\nEach year, the FHA sets minimum and maximum loan thresholds\u2014known as the \u201cfloor\u201d and \u201cceiling\u201d\u2014based on local housing prices. Limits vary by county and are relative to the number of units in the property (up to four).\nUnderstanding these limits helps borrowers focus their home search on properties that qualify for FHA financing.\nHere are the 2025 FHA loan limits for one-unit properties:\n- Low-cost area (floor): $524,225\n- High-cost area (ceiling): $1,209,750\nFHA Loan Options\nWhile commonly referred to as a single product, \u201cFHA loan\u201d is more of an umbrella term for several loan types.\nHere\u2019s an overview of the most common FHA loan types:\n- FHA home purchase 203(b) loan: The most common FHA loan, this option allows borrowers with a 580 credit score to put down as little as 3.5%. The loan is especially popular with first-time buyers with limited savings or a shaky credit history. Borrowers with credit scores as low as 500 may qualify with a 10% down payment.\n- Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage: The 203(k) loan helps buyers or current homeowners purchase or refinance a property that\u2019s at least one year old and in need of repairs. A portion of the loan covers the purchase (or refinance), while the rest goes toward approved renovation costs\u2014all bundled into one mortgage.\n- Section 203(h) Mortgage Insurance for Disaster Victims: Designed for victims of federally declared disasters, this loan requires no down payment and helps homeowners rebuild or relocate after their primary residence is significantly damaged or destroyed.\n- Good Neighbor Next Door: This program offers eligible teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers and EMTs a 50% discount off the list price of HUD-owned homes in designated revitalization areas. The goal is to provide affordable primary residences while supporting community renewal efforts.\nFHA Loan Rates\nAnother advantage of FHA loans is that they often come with lower mortgage rates than conventional loans. Still, it\u2019s important to factor in the upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums, which can reduce those savings over time.\nFHA borrowers can usually choose between a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), though not all lenders offer ARMs. Like conventional loans, fixed-rate FHA loans lock in at the same rate for the entire loan term, while ARMs start with a lower rate that adjusts\u2014up or down\u2014after the initial period.\nBefore that period ends, you may want to consider refinancing or moving to avoid potential rate increases.\nRelated: Current FHA Loan Rates\nFHA Loans: Who Can Qualify?\nWhile FHA loans are popular among first-time buyers, all borrowers can apply, and there\u2019s no limit to how many times you can use one., In most cases, however, you can have only one FHA loan at a time.\nHere are the primary eligibility requirements:\n- Minimum credit score: 500 (with a 10% down payment) or 580 (with 3.5% down)\n- Down payment: As low as 3.5%\n- Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio: 43% or lower, though some lenders allow up to 50%\n- Primary residence: Must be your primary residence (with limited exceptions)\n- One loan at a time: Borrowers with existing FHA loans may not be eligible unless certain exceptions are met.\n- Mortgage insurance: Annual premiums are required, but borrowers can request cancellation once certain conditions are met.\n- Employment: Verifiable employment history\n- Stable income: Proof of steady income sufficient to cover monthly loan payments\nFHA Loan: Pros and Cons\nAs with any mortgage option, FHA loans come with advantages and trade-offs.\nHere\u2019s what to consider when deciding whether an FHA loan might work for you or whether another option would be a better fit.\n| PROS | CONS |\n|---|---|\n| Low down payment options: You can often put down as little as 3.5%, making homeownership more accessible for those with limited funds. | Strict property standards: Homes must meet FHA health and safety guidelines, which can complicate the buying process and limit available listings. |\n| Flexible credit requirements: Borrowers with credit scores as low as 500 may qualify, though a 10% down payment is required for scores below 580. | Primary residences only: FHA loans typically cannot be used for second homes or investment properties. |\n| Higher debt-to-income (DTI) ratio allowances: Borrowers applying for FHA loans may be approved with higher DTI ratios compared to conventional loans. | Mortgage insurance is required: Borrowers must pay annual mortgage insurance premiums for at least 11 years. |\n| Assumable loans: A future buyer may have the option to take over your FHA loan, helping them to potentially secure a lower interest rate. | Loan caps: FHA loan limits are significantly lower than conventional loan caps, restricting how much you can borrow. |\n| Covers manufactured and mobile homes: FHA financing can be used even if the borrower does not own the land where the home sits. | Less competitive in hot markets: Sellers may favor buyers with conventional financing or all-cash offers over FHA loan borrowers. |\n| Refinancing options: Borrowers may be able to consider several FHA refinance loan types. | Potential repair costs: Homes that do not meet FHA standards may require upgrades before loan approval, adding to upfront expenses. |\nHow to Apply for an FHA Loan: A Step-by-Step Guide\nThe FHA loan application process is similar to a conventional mortgage, but with a few extra requirements.\nHere\u2019s a simple guide to help you navigate each stage, from finding the right lender to closing the deal.\n- Shop FHA-approved lenders. Not all lenders offer FHA loans, so confirm that the lenders you\u2019re considering offer this type of loan while shopping around for the best rates and terms.\n- Gather your paperwork. You\u2019ll need to provide lenders with standard documents like proof of personal identification, your Social Security number, proof of income and employment, financial and bank statements and credit history.\n- Apply to your top picks. You\u2019ll typically have the option to start the application online. Some lenders may also allow you to apply over the phone or in person.\n- Get pre-approved. If your credit and finances pass an initial review, lenders will issue a pre-approval letter stating how much you\u2019re qualified to borrow. This letter is typically valid for up to 90 days and is essential when house hunting, as it helps you shop within your budget and shows sellers you\u2019re a serious buyer. Keep in mind, though, that pre-approval isn\u2019t a guarantee. Lenders still need to conduct a more thorough application review before final approval.\n- Review your loan estimates. Lenders are required to provide a loan estimate within three business days of your application. Carefully compare each loan\u2019s terms, fees and annual percentage rates (APR) to help you choose the best lender for your needs.\n- Schedule an FHA home appraisal. The home you select must meet the minimum FHA property standards. Your lender will arrange the appointment with an FHA-approved appraiser. Lenders often bundle the appraisal expense into the closing costs.\n- Exercise patience during loan underwriting. During this review phase, the lender double-checks your documents and eligibility. It\u2019s often the longest part of the lending process, so hang tight!\n- Close the deal and get the keys. Once approved, it\u2019s time to finalize the sale. Your lender will send you a closing disclosure outlining the loan terms, closing costs and any other fees. Read the documents carefully and bring sufficient funds for your down payment and closing costs when meeting with the closing agents.\nHow to Get the Best FHA Loan Terms and Rates\nSecuring the best FHA loan terms will largely depend on how much work you put in. The more research you do and the stronger your financial profile, the better your chances of landing a budget-friendly loan.\nHere are a few strategic moves you can make to boost your chances of getting the most favorable rate and terms:\n- Get quotes from multiple FHA-approved lenders.\n- Strengthen your credit score.\n- Reduce your debt.\n- Stabilize your employment and income.\n- Use a mortgage calculator to help determine how much home you can afford.\n- Ask lenders about purchasing discount points to reduce the rate.\nFHA Loan Not the Right Fit? Explore These Alternatives\nAn FHA loan can be a great fit for some buyers, but it\u2019s certainly not the only path to affordable homeownership. Depending on your financial situation and long-term goals, another type of loan might be a better match.\nHere are several FHA loan alternatives that may be worth considering:\n- Conventional loan: These loans offer more flexibility in terms of property types and don\u2019t require homes to meet FHA-specific standards. With a conventional loan, you also typically have the right to ask your lender to cancel your mortgage insurance once the principal balance of your loan falls to 80% of your home\u2019s original value. FHA loans, on the other hand, often require this type of insurance for the life of the loan.\n- VA loan: Available to eligible veterans, active service members and qualifying family members through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), VA loans offer no down payment, no private mortgage insurance (PMI), looser credit standards and competitive interest rates.\n- USDA loan: Designed to help low- and very-low-income buyers purchase homes in eligible rural areas, USDA loans offer 0% down, reduced mortgage insurance and flexible credit requirements.\n- Native American Direct Loan (NADL): This VA-backed loan helps eligible Native American veterans and their spouses buy, build or improve homes on federally recognized tribal land. This type of loan features no down payment, no mortgage insurance and reduced closing costs.\n- Home Possible Mortgage: Freddie Mac\u2019s program allows very low- to low-income borrowers to put down as little as 3% on a primary residence. Funding can come from flexible sources like family, employer programs or sweat equity, a financing option that allows borrowers to apply the value of their construction skills in place of cash to improve the property. Borrowers must receive homeownership education and pay mortgage insurance if putting down less than 20%.\n- HomeReady Mortgage: Fannie Mae\u2019s HomeReady loan is also aimed at low- to very-low-income borrowers and requires as little as 3% down, allowing funds from various sources. It accepts alternative credit data, such as positive rent payments, requires a minimum 620 credit score and first-time buyers must complete a homeownership education course. Borrowers who put down less than 10% enjoy reduced mortgage insurance compared to conventional loans, and the mortgage insurance can be canceled once the loan-to-value ratio drops below 80%. Eligible first-time buyers may also receive a $2,500 credit toward closing costs.\n- Proprietary loans: Some lenders offer specialized programs to help make homeownership more accessible. Shop around to find which lender may have unique options that align with your financial situation.\nMethodology\nForbes Advisor reviewed 11 mortgage lenders that do business both online and in-person throughout the United States. The lenders we reviewed represent some of the largest mortgage lenders by volume, which include banks, credit unions and online lenders.\nOur scoring methodology included capturing more than 10 data points, which covered interest rates, lender fees, loan types, discounts, accessibility and borrower requirements.\nThe best lenders for FHA borrowers excelled in areas that are historically important for this group including low- to average-credit score requirements, low lender fees and low interest rates.\nThe following is the weighting assigned to each category:\n- Loan costs: 30%\n- Speed: 20%\n- Credit requirements: 20%\n- Loan types offered: 20%\n- Access and availability: 10%\nSpecific characteristics taken into consideration within each category include APR, average interest rate, origination fees, minimum credit score requirements, discounts and customer service availability.\nWe also offered bonus points up to 5% of the score when a lender considers alternative credit data.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhere can I get an FHA loan?\nYou can apply for an FHA-backed loan through any FHA-approved lender. Options include traditional banks, credit unions, private mortgage companies and online lenders.\nWhat is the best way to get an FHA loan?\nIf you\u2019re new to the home-buying process, a great first step is to contact a HUD-approved housing counseling agency to get answers and guidance on FHA loans. Then, research and compare your top lenders and confirm they offer FHA loans.\nDo I need cash reserves to qualify for an FHA loan?\nFHA loans typically don\u2019t require cash reserves to qualify for single-family residences. However, if you\u2019re buying a three- or four-unit property, you\u2019ll need at least three months of reserves to qualify.\nCan anyone get approved for an FHA loan?\nNot everyone qualifies for an FHA loan. For one, U.S. citizenship or permanent residency is required. Additionally, borrowers must have enough funds for the minimum down payment. Those with a past Chapter 7 bankruptcy must wait at least two years after filing and demonstrate reestablished credit to be eligible."

      "text": "If you\u2019re in the market to buy a house soon, you might have come across the terms conforming and non-conforming loans. It\u2019s just one extra layer that adds to the confusion of buying a house, but knowing the difference can help you target the right kind of loan for your situation. And that can actually help you get the house you want, or even help you save money.\nKey Differences: Conforming vs. Non-Conforming Loans\nThere are different classifications of loans you can use to buy a home, and conforming and non-conforming loans are of the most common. A conforming loan meets the guidelines to be sold to either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, two of the largest mortgage buyers in the U.S. Non-conforming loans, on the other hand, are those that fall outside those guidelines, so they can\u2019t be sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.\nAll mortgages fall under one of these two umbrellas\u2014they\u2019re either conforming to Fannie and Freddie guidelines, or they\u2019re not. The differences between these two lead to some interesting after-effects that impact you\u2014the buyer.\n| Conforming loans | Non-conforming loans |\n|---|---|\n|\nLoans may be sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac | Loans may be held by lender, or sold to another lender |\n|\nMore likely to be cheaper | More likely to be expensive |\n|\nMore common | Less common |\n|\nLimited to $548,250 in most areas (and up to $822,375 in some high-cost-of-living areas) | Potentially no limits on loan size |\nWhat Is a Conforming Loan?\nA conforming loan gets its name because it conforms to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines. These two businesses were created by Congress in 1938 and 1970, respectively, with a specific job: to buy mortgages that other lenders, like your neighborhood bank, give out. This frees up your lender\u2019s cash so they can make more loans, and thus the process continues so more people can afford to buy homes.\nThe mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac results in them buying the majority of the mortgages banks give out. But in order to accept them, they can\u2019t be all willy-nilly; they have to be standardized and made under certain guidelines. That\u2019s where the conforming part comes in, and why there are so many underwriting rules with these loans: it\u2019s to standardize the loans so that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy them.\nConforming Loan Requirements\nYou\u2019ll generally need to meet these requirements in order to get a conforming loan:\n- Minimum credit score. 620\n- Maximum loan limits. $548,250 in most areas, but may be higher in some high cost-of-living areas (review your county\u2019s limits)\n- Maximum debt-to-income ratio. 43%\n- Minimum down payment required. At least 3% (although you may have to pay for private mortgage insurance if you\u2019re putting less than 20% down)\nConforming Loan Benefits\nSince lenders can offload the mortgage they just gave to you (and the risk of default with it) by selling it to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they often come with lower interest rates. This is one of the biggest reasons to choose a conforming loan: they\u2019re more likely to be cheaper.\nThere are a few smaller perks as well. Since the process is so standardized, it also means you\u2019re less likely to have any curve balls thrown your way, such as weird lender requirements. And since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own such a large amount of mortgages and it falls loosely under the purview of the government, you could get some additional federal protections too.\nFor example, during the Covid pandemic, there was a federal moratorium placed on foreclosures for homes with conforming mortgages. If yours wasn\u2019t a conforming loan and wasn\u2019t covered under other federal foreclosure moratorium programs (such as for FHA loans), you could be at risk of foreclosure during this time. In this case, your lender would be free to foreclose on your home if you don\u2019t pay, even if it wasn\u2019t your fault.\nConforming Loan Drawbacks\nMost people will be best served by a conforming loan, but there are some cases where this isn\u2019t true, which we will cover in the following sections.\nConforming Loans May Not Be Enough, Especially in High-Cost Areas\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy an expensive house, you might find that you need to borrow more money than a conforming loan can offer. The median home price in the U.S. is $217,500\u2014well below the $548,250 loan limit threshold in most of the country. Thus, for most of the country, a conforming loan will usually cover all but the fanciest of houses.\nBut as you move into higher cost-of-living areas, more homes will fall above those limits, even as they\u2019re adjusted higher to compensate for this. For example, the median home price in San Francisco is $1,097,800\u2014well above the $822,375 conforming loan limit in this area.\nYou Might Be Better Off With a Government-Backed Loan\nThere are a lot of government mortgage programs to help people afford a house who might not otherwise be able to. For example, VA loans help servicemembers and veterans afford homes and USDA loans help lower-income consumers living in primarily rural areas afford homes. And FHA loans can be very beneficial if you don\u2019t have as much savings, or if your credit score could use some work.\nIn any case, if you choose a conforming loan, you won\u2019t be able to take advantage of these special programs. On the flip side, while these special loans can get you into a home faster, they can also be more expensive since they usually come with additional fees.\nWhat Is a Non-Conforming Loan?\nA non-conforming loan is simply any mortgage that doesn\u2019t conform to the requirements set forth by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Non-conforming loans commonly include jumbo loans (those above Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits) and government-backed loans like VA loans, FHA loans or USDA loans.\nNon-Conforming Loan Requirements\nIf you\u2019re targeting a non-conforming loan, the requirements vary a lot more by the type of mortgage you\u2019re applying for, and the lender you\u2019re applying with. The requirements for a VA loan, for example, might be very different than for a jumbo loan. But in general, here\u2019s how they might compare:\n- Minimum credit score. 580\n- Maximum loan limits. Varies by program and lender\n- Maximum debt-to-income ratio. Varies by program and lender\n- Minimum down payment required. Varies by program and lender, but you may be more likely to be approved with a down payment of at least 20%.\nNon-Conforming Loan Benefits\nThe biggest benefit of non-conforming loans is that you can afford a more expensive home, if you\u2019re going for a jumbo mortgage. Non-conforming loans can also be handy if you\u2019re looking for one of the government-backed loan programs, including VA loans, USDA loans or FHA loans.\nIf everyone was limited to applying for just conforming loans, we wouldn\u2019t see as many people buying more expensive houses\u2014or, conversely, low-income, rural or military homeowners either. Non-conforming loans are more applicable to people who fall outside of the civilian middle class, whether they be lower-income, higher-income or a military member.\nNon-Conforming Loan Drawbacks\nSince mortgage lenders can\u2019t sell non-conforming loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to free up their cash, they\u2019re a bit riskier for the lender. This is especially true for jumbo loans, which aren\u2019t backed by any government guarantees. If you default on a jumbo loan, it\u2019s a huge blow to the lender.\nThus, lenders generally charge higher interest rates to compensate, and they can have even more requirements. For example, lenders who give out jumbo loans often require that you make a down payment of at least 20% and show that you have at least six months\u2019 worth of cash in reserve, if not more.\nConforming vs. Non-Conforming Loan: Which Is Best for Me?\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy a reasonably-priced house and don\u2019t need any of the special government-backed mortgage programs, it\u2019s usually best to go with a conforming loan because it\u2019s cheaper overall.

      "text": "Buying a home requires more than just saving up to get a mortgage and finding your perfect home. It also includes finding the right type of mortgage that\u2019s best for your budget\u2014loan term, interest rate and monthly payment all play a factor in what you can reasonably afford. An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) might be something to consider as you\u2019re exploring different borrowing options.\nWhat Is an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage?\nAn ARM, sometimes called a variable-rate mortgage, is a mortgage with an interest rate that changes or fluctuates during your loan term. Other loans typically have a fixed rate, where the interest rate doesn\u2019t change over the life of the loan.\nUsually, ARMs start off with a lower interest rate compared to fixed-rate mortgage rates but can increase (or decrease) over time.\nHow Does an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Work?\nWith a fixed-rate loan, you\u2019ll pay one set amount every month for the duration of your loan term, like 15, 20 or 30 years. If you keep the same loan with the same lender, your mortgage payment won\u2019t change.\nAdjustable-rate mortgages, on the other hand, have fluctuating interest rates. In most cases, the rate will stay the same for a set amount of time based on the lender and type of ARM you choose. This could mean the rate is the same for the first month or up to five years. For example, if you get a 5/1 ARM, your rate will remain fixed for the first five years and then will become variable for the rest of the term.\nBased on the terms you agreed to with your mortgage lender, your payment could change from one month to the next, or you might not see a change for many months or even years.\nRelated: Current ARM Rates\nTypes of ARMs\nThere are a few different types of ARMs: hybrid, interest-only and payment option.\nHybrid\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a buying option like 5/1 or 7/1 ARM, that\u2019s a hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage. For these types of loans, the interest rate is fixed for a set number of years\u2014like three, five or seven, for example. After that initial period, the rate adjusts annually or according to the terms set by the lender, which might be more or less frequent.\nThe first number is how long the interest rate is fixed and the second number is how frequently that rate changes after the initial period. For instance, using our same example from above, a 5/1 ARM means the rate is fixed for five years and then variable every year after that.\nInterest-Only\nAn interest-only (I-O) mortgage means you\u2019ll only pay interest for a set amount of years before you get the chance to start paying down the principal balance. With a traditional fixed-rate mortgage, you\u2019ll pay a portion of the principal and some of the interest every month but the total payment you make never changes.\nWith an I-O home loan, you\u2019ll have smaller monthly payments that increase over time as you eventually start to pay down the principal balance. The longer your I-O period, the larger your monthly payments will be after the I-O period ends. Most I-O periods last between three and 10 years.\nPayment Option\nWith a payment option ARM, you have a few different ways to pay back your loan.\n- Traditional: This method includes a traditional breakdown of principal and interest. It\u2019s similar to a fixed-rate mortgage, where you pay a part of your principal and interest every month. This is the only option to reduce how much you owe on your loan.\n- Interest-only: With this loan, you have the option to pay only the interest for a certain period of time, typically a few years, and then you pay both the interest and principal for the remainder of the loan. While paying only the interest does sound attractive, it can add up costs on the back-end when it\u2019s time to start paying off your loan balance.\n- Minimum (or limited): You can make the minimum payment for this one, but any interest you don\u2019t pay gets added onto the principal balance of the loan, which means you\u2019re essentially paying interest on interest. This option could be hard on your finances\u2014because regardless of your financial circumstance when your loan term ends, you\u2019re responsible for the total balance due.\nPros and Cons of an ARM\nWhile an ARM is one way to repay your home loan, it\u2019s not always the best way for everyone. Make sure to weigh the pros and cons before choosing this option.\nPros of an ARM\n- Lower initial rate: ARMs tend to have lower initial interest rates compared to fixed-rate mortgages. If you qualify for a low-interest ARM, you could pay a lot less in interest upfront.\n- Fluctuation could mean a drop in interest: Even though there\u2019s a chance your interest rate could go up, it could also go down. Since the rate is based on a benchmark, you could see a lower interest rate than what fixed-rate loans offer.\n- Payment caps: While an interest rate may go up, ARMs have payment caps, which limit how much your lender can increase the rate. The caps also control how many times a lender can bump up the rate. So, while your rate is likely to increase at some point, you might not face as big of an increase as you think.\nCons of an ARM\n- Potential rise in rates: After the initial period, your interest rate is set to rise, usually annually. If you aren\u2019t prepared for the adjustment, you could face a payment increase that you may not be able to afford.\n- Complicated structures: There isn\u2019t just one type of ARM\u2014there are many. Because of this, it can get confusing. If you don\u2019t understand all the moving parts and do your research, you could wind up paying more than you expected.\nARM vs. Fixed-Rate Mortgage: Which One Is Right For You?\nYou might want an ARM if:\n- This isn\u2019t a long-term home. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to stick around for the long run, you can take advantage of your home\u2019s low initial interest rate and sell it before the rate adjusts to a potentially higher one.\n- You expect to earn more. A fluctuating interest rate is best for borrowers who are financially comfortable to handle the uptick in costs. If you think your income is going to go up within the next few years, your bank account might be able to handle an ARM. Along with that, if you\u2019re a high earner right now, you could make extra payments toward your loan and pay it off early\u2014before the new interest rate starts. But make sure this is OK with your lender, so you don\u2019t get hit with a prepayment penalty.\nYou may want a fixed-rate mortgage instead if:\n- You\u2019re buying your forever home. For borrowers who are thinking about a home purchase they plan to keep for a long time, a fluctuating interest rate might not be your best option. If your goal is to live in the home for many years to come, a fixed-rate mortgage might be better for you since it is dependable and consistent.\n- You have a strict budget. Fixed-rate loans mean you\u2019re paying the same amount every month, so you know exactly what you\u2019re responsible for. ARMs might be too much for your finances if your budget is tight, even if the change is a few years down the road."

      "text": "There\u2019s so much to think about when buying a home. You want to choose the right neighborhood, get the lowest mortgage rate possible and find a property with all your desired amenities. But before you get too wrapped up in the details of homebuying, take a step back and consider how private mortgage insurance might fit into the equation. It\u2019s not exactly cheap, after all.\nWhat Is PMI?\nPrivate mortgage insurance, or PMI, is a type of mortgage insurance coverage required by some lenders when the mortgage borrower doesn\u2019t make a large enough down payment. This mortgage insurance doesn\u2019t actually protect you in any way. Instead, it\u2019s there to protect the lender from a major financial loss in case you\u2019re unable to repay your loan. If the property goes into a short sale or foreclosure auction and there isn\u2019t enough equity built up to cover the loss, PMI serves as a way to fill the gap.\nWho Needs PMI Insurance, and Can You Avoid It?\nConventional mortgage lenders require PMI when the down payment on a home loan is less than 20% of the purchase price, or when you refinance with less than 20% equity. Some government-backed loans, such as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, also require mortgage insurance, but it works a bit differently.\nOf course, saving up 20% of your home\u2019s value is easier said than done. The median sale price for an existing home in the U.S. was $392,800 in 2022, according to the National Association of Realtors. That means you need to save at least $78,560 to avoid PMI. Depending on your personal financial situation, location and lifestyle, that may or may not be realistic.\nThat\u2019s why paying PMI isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing if you can easily afford it. But if PMI would strain your budget or cause you to spend significantly more on a home than you\u2019d like, it\u2019s a good idea to avoid it.\nHow Much Is PMI?\nThe cost of private mortgage insurance ranges depending on the particular lender and how much money you actually put down on the loan. PMI is calculated as a percentage of your total loan amount and generally ranges between 0.58% and 1.86%. The larger your loan, the more PMI you will end up paying.\nThe cost of PMI is also influenced by your loan-to-value ratio (LTV). This represents how much you\u2019re borrowing in comparison to the total value of the property. The more you put down, the less you need to borrow, which gives you a higher LTV. For example, if you put 20% down on a home, your LTV should then be 80%. A smaller down payment\u2014and thus, lower LTV\u2014likely will require you to pay PMI until you reach that 80% mark. The lower your LTV, the higher the risk for the lender, which is why the cost of PMI often increases as your LTV decreases.\nFinally, your credit score also can influence the cost of PMI. The higher your score, the less risk you represent to lenders, so it may be possible to qualify for lower PMI with good credit.\nLet\u2019s look at an example of how much PMI can cost:\nSay you purchased a home for $500,000 and only put 10% down ($50,000). That means you borrowed a total of $450,000. Your lender charges you PMI of 1%, for an annual premium of $4,500 or $375 per month.\nThe good news? PMI is currently tax deductible. Previously, you could only deduct PMI through 2017. However, thanks to the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, Congress extended the deduction through Dec. 31, 2020. That means you can deduct PMI for tax years 2019 and 2020, as well as retroactively for 2018.\nMortgage Insurance vs. Homeowners Insurance\nMortgage insurance is a payment you have to make when you put down less than 20% on a home loan. Homeowners insurance, on the other hand, is coverage you\u2019re required to carry throughout your mortgage term\u2014and it\u2019s a good idea to have it even after you\u2019re mortgage free.\nThe cost of homeowners insurance depends on your home\u2019s value and location, the property\u2019s claims history, the level of coverage you buy, the deductible you choose and more. Homeowners insurance protects you\u2014the homeowner\u2014but it also indirectly protects the lender because your home is the collateral for your mortgage.\n| Mortgage Insurance | Homeowners Insurance | |\n|---|---|---|\n| When Is It Required? | Usually required with a down payment less than 20% | Always required on mortgaged property; optional for free-and-clear homeowners but highly recommended |\n| Who Does It Protect? | Protects the lender | Protects the homeowner\u2019s investment and the lender\u2019s collateral |\n| Who Does It Pay? | Pays the lender if you default on your mortgage | Pays the homeowner to repair or rebuild after a covered loss |\n| How Do You Pay It? | Can be paid up front, monthly or financed | Can be paid annually or in monthly installments as part of your mortgage payment |\nHow Do You Pay PMI?\nYour lender will arrange PMI through its own network of insurance providers. The terms of the plan, including cost and length of time you\u2019re required to pay it, will be provided to you at closing.\nYou can choose to pay the premium up-front as part of your closing costs, and then annually until you\u2019re no longer required to pay it. Alternatively, you can roll the premium into your loan and make monthly payments on top of your regular loan payments. Keep in mind that if you split up the payments, however, you\u2019ll pay interest on them, too. This can cause PMI to be much more expensive than you realize.\nHow Do You Get Rid of PMI?\nFortunately, there are a few ways to eventually get rid of PMI if you\u2019re required to pay it now. The first is to consistently make your payments until you have 20% equity in your home\u2014or an LTV of 80%\u2014at which point you can reach out to your loan servicer and request to cancel it. If you don\u2019t reach out, you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer before it\u2019s canceled automatically.\n\u201cA mortgage servicer is required to automatically cancel PMI when the [LTV] reaches 78% based on the terms of your loan when it originated,\u201d said Tyler Warrick, strategic financing advisor at Real Estate Bees and a mortgage broker serving clients in Arizona, California and Texas.\nHow To Get Rid of PMI Early\nYou may no longer need to pay PMI if your home value increases. In this situation, your LTV might reach 80% ahead of schedule. Contact your lender to ask about reappraising your home and canceling your PMI. You\u2019ll be responsible for the appraisal fee (typically a few hundred dollars).\n\u201cKeep in mind, your interpretation of your home\u2019s value may be different from an appraiser\u2019s opinion,\u201d Warrick said. \u201cThey will base this off of recent sales and comparable properties.\u201d\nFinally, if your cash flow has increased, making extra payments toward your loan principal can also help you reach an LTV of 80% sooner.\nThough you probably love the thought of getting rid of PMI as soon as possible, crunch the numbers first. Make sure that paying extra toward your mortgage is a better financial move than using the funds for other purposes, such as saving for retirement or paying off higher-interest debt.\nIs Private Mortgage Insurance Worth It?\nIf the idea of paying private mortgage insurance gives you pause, it should. PMI is an avoidable extra cost associated with buying a home.\nThat said, sometimes paying PMI is the right move; it can help you get into a home that would otherwise be out of reach. So before you make the decision to take out a home loan that includes PMI, do your research to ensure you understand what it is, if you need it, and how much it costs.\nForbes Advisor Mortgages Contributor Casey Bond contributed to this article.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhen can you drop PMI on an FHA loan?\nFHA loans don\u2019t have PMI, but they do have something similar called mortgage insurance premiums, or MIPs. With an FHA loan and a down payment of 10% or less, you\u2019ll pay MIPs for as long as you have the loan, no matter how much equity you have. With a down payment of more than 10%, you\u2019ll pay MIPs for 11 years.\nHow long do you pay PMI for?\nYou pay PMI until you have at least 20% equity in your home. The longer your loan term and the smaller your down payment, the longer it will take to accumulate 20% equity by making your monthly mortgage payments. You can check your mortgage amortization schedule or use a mortgage amortization calculator to see how long it\u2019ll take you to reach this point.\nIf your home\u2019s value increases significantly, you can talk to your lender about getting your home appraised to prove that your equity has reached at least 20%. You may be able to cancel PMI ahead of schedule this way.\nWhat does PMI cover?\nPMI reimburses your lender for a portion of your principal balance if you default on your mortgage. It doesn\u2019t reimburse you for anything, even though you\u2019re the one who pays for it.\nPMI still helps you as a borrower, however. Without mortgage insurance, lenders might not offer you a low down payment mortgage, or they might charge you a much higher interest rate. The less equity you have, the lower your incentive to keep up with your mortgage payments because you don\u2019t stand to lose as much if you end up in foreclosure. That\u2019s why lenders consider borrowers with little equity to be riskier."

Start by adding the total purchase price for the home you\u2019re seeking to buy on the left side of the screen. If you don\u2019t have a specific house in mind, you can experiment with this number to see how much house you can afford. And if you\u2019re considering making an offer on a home, this calculator can help you determine how much you can afford to offer.\nInput your down payment amount. Next, add the down payment you expect to make as either a percentage of the purchase price or as a specific amount.\nEnter your interest rate. If you\u2019ve already shopped around for a loan and have been offered a range of interest rates, enter one of those values into the interest rate box on the left. If you haven\u2019t prequalified for an interest rate yet, you can enter the current average mortgage rate as a starting point.\nChoose a loan term. To help calculate your monthly mortgage payment, enter a loan term up to a maximum of 30 years. If you haven\u2019t been approved for a loan term and interest rate, the rate you select here should correspond with the average rate you entered above. For example, if you choose a 15-year term, use the average rate for a 15-year mortgage. If, instead, you want a balance between low monthly payments and a shorter term, you can use this portion of the calculator to compare your options.\nAdd in taxes, insurance and homeowners association (HOA) fees. This portion of the calculator is optional, but it can help give you a more accurate picture of your potential monthly payments. If you have the information available, plug in your monthly property tax, private mortgage insurance (PMI), homeowners insurance and HOA fees. If you don\u2019t have these numbers in front of you, some information may be available through your real estate agent or your local property assessor\u2019s website.\nReview your loan details. Once you enter all of the relevant information on the left side of the screen, the calculator will auto-populate your payment breakdown on the right. This portion of the calculator lets you view your monthly payments as well as your estimated payoff month. Navigate to the amortization schedule tab to view how much of your annual payments will go toward interest and principal. You can also toggle between the annual and monthly view to see a breakdown of each monthly payment.\nHow To Break Down the Mortgage Payment Formula\nThe formula behind paying down a mortgage is complex, but it can be handy. It helps homeowners and would-be homeowners see what paying more money would mean for their monthly budget and their overall wealth profile.\nThe formula for calculating your mortgage payments is as follows:\nM=P[r(1+r)n]/[(1+r)n-1]\nSYMBOL\nMEANING\nM\nTotal monthly mortgage payment\nP\nPrincipal loan amount\nr\nMonthly interest rates (divide the annual rate by 12)\nn\nNumber of payments over life of the loan (multiply loan term in years by 12)\nA mortgage calculator has many benefits, and you can use it to:\nDetermine how much you\u2019ll pay over the life of your loan\nBreak down your monthly payments based on the estimated sale price, down payment and interest rate\nSet a price range to shop in\nCompare payments on different loan types\nSee what your mortgage payment may look like with homeowners insurance, taxes, private mortgage insurance and/or HOA fees\nThese calculators are free and available online, allowing you to experiment with different scenarios and variables whenever you please.\nCurrent Mortgage Rates\nTypical Mortgage Fees and Costs\nIf this is your first time shopping for a mortgage, the terminology can be intimidating. It also can be difficult to understand what you\u2019re paying for\u2014and why.\nHere\u2019s what to look for when reviewing your mortgage costs and fees:\nPrincipal. Principal is the amount of money you borrowed on the mortgage. A portion of each payment will go toward paying this off, so the number will go down as you make monthly payments.\nInterest rate. This is essentially what the lender is charging you to borrow the money. Your interest rate is expressed as a percentage and may be fixed or variable.\nProperty taxes. Property taxes are imposed by your local tax authority. This number can usually be viewed on your recorder or assessor\u2019s website\u2014wherever you access property cards and other real estate records.\nHomeowners insurance.Homeowners insurance is required to protect you and your lender in the case of damage to your home. If you\u2019re considering a home, ask the real estate agent if they have any information about current insurance costs. Otherwise, contact your local insurance agent to get a quote.\nMortgage insurance. Also known as private mortgage insurance\u2014or PMI\u2014this protects the lender in case you default on your mortgage. It typically ranges from 0.58% to 1.86% of your total mortgage amount and you will need to factor this in if your down payment is less than 20%.\nHOA fees. Homeowner Association fees may be required if you buy a property in a shared community such as a condominium complex. HOAs are private organizations set up to govern and maintain such spaces. The fees may be nominal, but they might make your monthly payments unaffordable.\nFind Competitive Mortgage Rates Near You\nCompare lenders and rates with Mortgage Research Center\nHow much house you can afford depends on several factors, including your monthly income, existing debt service and how much you have saved for a down payment. When determining whether to approve you for a certain mortgage amount, lenders pay close attention to your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.\nYour DTI compares your total monthly debt payments to your monthly pre-tax income. In general, you shouldn\u2019t pay more than 28% of your income to a house payment, though you may be approved with a higher percentage.\nKeep in mind, however, that just because you can afford a house on paper doesn\u2019t mean your budget can actually handle the payments. Beyond the factors your bank considers when pre-approving you for a mortgage amount, consider how much money you\u2019ll have on-hand after you make the down payment. It\u2019s best to have at least three months of payments in savings in case you experience financial hardship.\nAlong with calculating how much you expect to pay in maintenance and other house-related expenses each month, you should also consider your other financial goals. For example, if you\u2019re planning to retire early, determine how much money you need to save or invest each month and then calculate how much you\u2019ll have leftover to dedicate to a mortgage payment.\nUltimately, the house you can afford depends on what you\u2019re comfortable with\u2014just because a bank pre-approves you for a mortgage doesn\u2019t mean you should maximize your borrowing power.\nWhen determining how much home one can afford, what are some important costs that buyers typically overlook?\nJames Sias\nHead of Mortgage Revenue at Fifth Third Bank\nFred Chilton\nAdvisory Board Member\nIt\u2019s crucial as you set your budget for your new home to make sure you account for often overlooked costs above & beyond the purchase price. These expenses can often add hundreds or even thousands of dollars in additional expenses and should be factored into your overall budget.\nA couple of costs that are often a surprise for new homebuyers include:\nClosing costs: These costs, including loan origination expenses, title insurance, escrow, appraisal and other fees, typically run between 3-5% of the home\u2019s purchase price.\nPrivate mortgage insurance: If you put less than 20% down, buyers may need to purchase PMI as a requirement of their loan.\nHome inspection: It\u2019s critical to get a full home inspection done to help identify any potential issues with the property before you purchase it.\nProperty taxes: Buyers need to budget for property taxes today and in the future, as they have been rising in most markets in recent years.\nHOA fees: If the property is located in a community with a HOA, there will be monthly or annual dues the buyer will be responsible for.\nMoving costs: These are expenses related to hiring movers, renting a truck, packing supplies or even a storage unit, which can add up quickly.\nMaintenance and repairs: Few homeowners often underestimate the cost of maintenance and general repairs required to keep up their property. This can include things like plumbing, electrical, appliances repair or replacement, landscaping, roofing and other general maintenance.\nBeing aware of these and all the other expenses associated with buying a new home can help you make the best informed and realistic decision about your new home budget.\nWhen determining how much home one can afford, buyers often overlook several important costs outside of the standard loan origination fees. These include:\nProperty taxes: Property Taxes vary by location and can alter monthly payments significantly. It\u2019s important to estimate these based on the home\u2019s assessed value. You can also look property taxes up on the county tax assessor\u2019s website.\nHomeowners insurance: We know that homeowners insurance is part of your mortgage payment, but did you know that homeowners insurance premiums vary widely based on the home\u2019s location, size and even the roof age?\nMoving costs: These are not part of your mortgage closing costs, but if you\u2019re purchasing a home and moving, you\u2019ll sometimes have to shell out thousands of dollars to hire movers.\nA mortgage term is the period when a mortgage is amortized\u2014stated another way, it\u2019s the length of time you have to pay off your mortgage. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, though other terms also exist and may even range up to 40 years. The length of your mortgage terms dictates (in part) how much you\u2019ll pay each month\u2014the longer your term, the lower your monthly payment.\nThat said, interest rates are usually lower for 15-year mortgages than for 30-year terms, and you\u2019ll pay more in interest over the life of a 30-year loan. To determine which mortgage term is right for you, consider how much you can afford to pay each month and how quickly you prefer to have your mortgage paid off.\nPro Tip\nIf you can afford to pay more each month but still don\u2019t know which term to choose, it\u2019s also worth considering whether you\u2019d be able to break even\u2014or, perhaps, save\u2014on the interest by choosing a lower monthly payment and investing the difference.\nHow To Lower Your Mortgage Payment\nThere are a number of way you can lower your mortgage payment, such as:\nMaking a larger down payment\nIncreasing the amount of principal you pay on a monthly basis\nMaking a one-time lump sum payment toward your principal balance\nInformation provided on Forbes Advisor is for educational purposes only.

      "text": "You\u2019ve likely seen the Federal Reserve in the news, but maybe haven\u2019t paid much attention to it. But if you\u2019re a prospective home buyer paying attention to mortgage rates, you might want to keep an eye on the Fed\u2019s actions.\nWhy? The Fed sets a key interest rate that guides short-term borrowing costs, and these decisions indirectly affect mortgage rates.\nWhile mortgage rates rise or fall due to a combination of complex economic factors, predicting their ups and downs with certainty is like trying to pick winning lottery numbers. Understanding Fed rate decisions and projections can provide valuable insight into potential mortgage rate trends.\nUnderstanding the Federal Reserve\u2019s Role in Interest Rates\nEstablished by Congress in 1913, the Federal Reserve serves as the central bank for the U.S., working to ensure a stable financial system and a healthy national economy.\nThe Fed leverages monetary policy tools to achieve its so-called dual mandate goal of maintaining a 2% inflation average over time while striving for maximum employment.\nQuantitative Easing and Quantitative Tightening Explained\nQuantitative easing is a policy tool where the Fed buys U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS)\u2014a fixed investment product secured by a pool of mortgages\u2014to inject cash into the financial system and reduce borrowing costs.\nThe Fed applied quantitative easing during the onset of the Covid-19 crisis to help stabilize the economy. This approach raised bond prices and caused bond yields to decrease (bond prices and yields move in opposite directions). The lower yields led to reduced lending rates across the economy, including mortgage rates.\nHowever, when inflation skyrocketed in 2022, the Fed reversed course, employing quantitative tightening, selling its bond holdings or letting them mature without reinvesting. This process removed money from the financial system, increasing the bond supply, cooling demand and helping ease inflation.\nDue to their increased supply, bond prices fell. Meanwhile, yields rose, indirectly contributing to the run-up in mortgage rates.\nWhat Is the Federal Funds Rate?\nAnother key tool the Fed uses is setting the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the interest rate financial institutions reference to lend to each other overnight.\nBanks are required to have a minimum level of cash reserves. Any funds that exceed that level are available for short-term lending to other financial institutions that may need a reserve boost.\nThe Fed intentionally sets the target rate range at eight regularly scheduled meetings per calendar year through its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe committee is composed of 12 voting members\u2014a specific mix of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The committee reviews and discusses financial conditions and elect whether to raise, lower or pause rate changes in support of its dual mandate.\nFOMC meetings last two days, and the committee releases its interest decision in the afternoon of the second day, typically 2 p.m. ET.\nHere\u2019s the list of FOMC meetings for 2025:\n- January 28-29\n- March 18-19\n- May 6-7\n- June 17-18\n- July 29-30\n- September 16-17\n- October 28-29\n- December 9-10\nHow Much Do FOMC Decisions Impact Mortgage Rates?\nDecisions by the FOMC typically influence the prime rate\u2014a benchmark interest rate lenders reserve for their lowest-risk borrowers.\nVariable-rate loans such as home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are tied to the prime rate, and so tend to rise and fall with federal funds rate decisions.\nHowever, FOMC decisions do not set mortgage rates. Still, an example of the Fed\u2019s influence could be seen when mortgage rates fell in the summer of 2024 as the market anticipated a Fed rate cut in September.\nIndeed, at its September meeting, the FOMC voted for a jumbo-size 50-basis-point cut after keeping the rate range at 5.25% to 5.5% for 14 months. Yet, mortgage rates rose even as policymakers followed this with two more 25-basis-point cuts. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.\nThe table below shows how mortgage rates responded to FOMC rate decisions and market expectations for future Fed policy in 2024.\n| 2024 | FOMC MEETINGS 2024 | FEDERAL FUNDS RATE RANGE (%) | 30-YEAR FIXED RATE (MONTHLY AVERAGE %) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| January | January 30-31 | 5.25% to 5.5% | 6.64% |\n| February | 6.78% | ||\n| March | March 19-20 | 5.25% to 5.5% | 6.82% |\n| April | April 30-May 1 | 5.25% to 5.5% | 6.99% |\n| May | 7.06% | ||\n| June | June 11-12 | 5.25% to 5.5% | 6.92% |\n| July | July 30-31 | 5.25% to 5.5% | 6.85% |\n| August | 6.5% | ||\n| September | September 17-18 | 4.75% to 5% | 6.18% |\n| October | 6.43% | ||\n| November | November 6-7 | 4.5% to 4.75% | 6.81% |\n| December | December 17-18 | 4.25% to 4.5% | 6.72% |\nAre There Any Factors That Influence Mortgage Rates Directly?\nNo single factor directly influences whether mortgage rates rise or fall.\nHistorically, mortgage rates have closely followed the 10-year Treasury yield. Lenders set mortgage rates by adding a mortgage spread to the 10-year yield.\nThe spread sweetens the pot for investors in mortgage-backed securities. The 10-year Treasury and mortgage-backed securities tend to attract the same investors. However, compared to the 10-year Treasury, investing in an MBS is viewed as a far greater risk.\nHistorically, the spread between the 30-year, fixed mortgage rate and the 10-year yield has been between 150 and 200 basis points. However, it has largely remained above 200 basis points in recent years.\nInvestor demand for mortgage-backed securities can impact mortgage rates. Mortgage origination and refinance activity levels also play a role.\nMeanwhile, regardless of where mortgage rates are, you can still gain some control in lowering your rate by taking steps to strengthen your credit score, lower your debt-to-income ratio and shopping multiple lenders."

      "text": "You\u2019ve kept a steady job over the last few years and worked hard to improve your credit. Now you\u2019re ready to submit that loan application. Or are you?\nIn addition to your job history and credit, lenders will consider another major measure of financial health: debt-to-income ratio, or DTI. Learn more about what your DTI means, how it\u2019s calculated and how to get yours in great shape.\nWhat Is Debt-to-Income Ratio?\nYour debt-to-income ratio is a measurement lenders use to find out how much of your income goes toward paying off debt every month. It considers all your monthly debt payments in comparison to your gross monthly income, and is expressed as a percentage.\nWhen you apply to borrow money, lenders like to see a low DTI. This is a strong indication that you have enough cash to make your payments on time every month. A low DTI is also a great sign that you\u2019re in a solid place financially and can comfortably afford your lifestyle\u2014whether or not you plan to borrow.\nHow to Calculate Debt-to-Income Ratio\nTo calculate your debt-to-income ratio, start by adding up all your monthly debt obligations. This includes revolving credit, such as credit cards and other lines of credit, as well as installment loans such as student loans, car loans and personal loans. You also should include any child support or alimony payments you\u2019re responsible for making each month. Usually, you don\u2019t need to consider other expenses such as food, utilities and insurance.\nOnce you have all your obligations tallied, divide that number by your gross monthly income (that\u2019s what you earn before taxes, retirement contributions and other deductions are taken out). You\u2019ll end up with a decimal fraction, which you can multiply by 100 to get your DTI percentage. The equation looks like this:\nDTI = Monthly Debts / Gross Monthly Income\nFor example, say your debts are as follows:\n- Credit Card A: $500\n- Credit Card B: $350\n- Auto Loan: $150\n- Home Equity Line Of Credit: $200\n- Student Loan: $400\nThat gives you a total of $1,600 in monthly obligations. Now say your gross monthly income is $5,000. You would calculate your DTI as follows:\n$1,600 / $5,000 = 0.32\nMultiply the result by 100 and you have a DTI of 32%. In other words, 32% of your gross monthly income goes toward paying back debt.\nKeep in mind that even if your DTI is considered low, other monthly expenses can take a bite out of your budget. When borrowing money, it\u2019s important to consider how these other costs could affect your ability to stay on top of payments.\nTypes of Debt-to-Income Ratios\nGenerally, the equation above gets you your general debt-to-income ratio. However, some lenders like to break this number down even further to find your front-end and back-end DTI. You\u2019ll often come across these terms when applying for a mortgage.\nFront-end DTI measures your housing costs or potential housing costs only in relation to your income. Also known as the housing ratio, this calculation takes into consideration your monthly mortgage payment, private mortgage insurance and other costs associated with your home loan, divided by gross monthly income.\nBack-end DTI is the more comprehensive calculation. This version of DTI not only looks at your housing expenses, but all debt obligations such as credit cards and loans, divided by gross monthly income.\nWhat Is Considered a Good DTI Ratio?\nWhat counts as a \u201cgood\u201d DTI will depend on what type of loan you want. Some lenders allow a higher DTI, while others require a lower cut-off.\nIn general, lenders prefer that your back-end ratio not exceed 36%. That means if you earn $5,000 in monthly gross income, your total debt obligations should be $1,800 or less. However, some lenders might make an exception if you have excellent credit. In fact, it\u2019s possible to qualify for a loan with up to a 50% DTI as long as you\u2019re an otherwise highly qualified borrower.\nMortgage lenders, in particular, tend to have more hard-and-fast rules. They typically prefer a front-end DTI of 28% or less. That means your mortgage payments can\u2019t be any higher than 28% of your gross monthly income. So if you take home $5,000 per month, your mortgage payments shouldn\u2019t be any higher than $1,400.\nOn the other hand, conventional mortgage lenders, as well as FHA and USDA lenders, will typically allow a back-end DTI of up to 43%, giving your budget a little more wiggle room. VA loans usually require a back-end DTI of 41% or less.\nKnowing your front-end and back-end DTI can help you figure out how much house you can afford. If you apply for a mortgage and the payments would cause you to exceed either of these DTI requirements, you may have to go with a smaller loan or could be denied a loan altogether.\nHow DTI Impacts Your Credit Score\nNot only does your DTI impact your ability to secure a loan, it also indirectly affects your credit. That means even if you aren\u2019t trying to borrow money right now, a DTI that\u2019s too high could knock points off your credit score and make it tougher to secure an apartment or open a utility account.\nThe main reason DTI and credit are related is because the total amount of debt you owe affects approximately 30% of your FICO score. The lower the amount of debt you owe in relation to your available credit, the better for your score. Conversely, the more debt you have to your name, the worse its impact on your score. So if you have a high DTI, it follows that you are probably using a significant portion of your available credit.\nDTI also can impact your credit if you owe so much that you aren\u2019t able to keep up with payments. As the most heavily weighted factor in calculating your credit score, payment history makes up 35%. Just one missed payment can knock quite a few points off your score, so it\u2019s important to keep your debt levels manageable.\nHow to Lower Your DTI Ratio\nGenerally, if you\u2019re trying to lower your DTI, there are two things you can do: Increase your monthly income or decrease your outstanding debt. Here\u2019s a closer look at how to accomplish each of those goals:\n- Increase your monthly income. Increasing your income is easier said than done. Still, if lowering your DTI is a goal, finding ways to increase your pay is one way to do it. It might be time to negotiate a raise at work or take on a few extra hours of overtime. You also can turn a hobby or skill into a lucrative side hustle and bring in extra income on the side when your schedule allows it.\n- Decrease your outstanding debt. Your other option is to get rid of some debt so that your monthly payments are lower (or better, nonexistent). Bonus at work? Tax refund? Use these windfalls to make extra lump-sum payments on your debt. By lowering the amount you owe on a monthly basis, your DTI will drop, too.\nForbes Advisor Editor in Chief Mike Cetera contributed to this article."

      "text": "When you\u2019re shopping for a home loan, you\u2019ll see lenders advertise their best mortgage interest rate vs. APR, or annual percentage rate. They\u2019re required to show you both rates, because APR gives you a sense of the lender\u2019s fees in addition to the interest rate. As a borrower, you need to know if a lender is making up for a low advertised interest rate with high fees, and that\u2019s what the APR can tell you. If the APR is close to the interest rate, you\u2019ll know that the lender\u2019s fees are low.\nWe\u2019ll explain how lenders use APR vs. interest rate and how you can use your new understanding of these terms to save money on your home loan. Even if you already think you understand how APR works from your experience with credit cards and auto loans, there\u2019s a lot you may not know about how APR works for home loans.\nWhat Is an Interest Rate?\nAn interest rate is the cost to borrow money. When you borrow money to buy a home or a car, you pay interest. When you lend money, you earn interest. If you have a savings account or certificate of deposit, you\u2019re lending money to a bank and they\u2019re paying you a small return so you\u2019ll have an incentive to put your money there.\nInterest is usually expressed as an annual rate. Freddie Mac, which publishes a weekly Primary Mortgage Market survey, found in late August 2020 the U.S. average weekly mortgage rate was 2.91% on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\nWhat Is APR?\nAPR, or annual percentage rate, is a calculation that includes both a loan\u2019s interest rate and a loan\u2019s finance charges, expressed as an annual cost over the life of the loan. In other words, it\u2019s the total cost of credit. APR accounts for interest, fees and time.\nGoing back to Freddie Mac\u2019s Primary Mortgage Market survey, there\u2019s an important piece of additional information you need to know: The average interest rate of 2.91% comes with an average of 0.8 fees and points, or $800 for every $100,000 borrowed. So the national average APR on a 30-year fixed-rate home loan was 2.99% at the end of August.\nAPR vs. Interest Rate: Why These Numbers Matter in a Mortgage\nSince APR includes both the interest rate and certain fees associated with a home loan, APR can help you understand the total cost of a mortgage if you keep it for the entire term. The APR will usually be higher than the interest rate, but there are exceptions.\nOne is a no-closing-cost refinance: In this case, the interest rate and APR will be the same.\nAnother is an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). The APR for an ARM will sometimes be lower than the interest rate. This can happen in a declining interest rate environment when lenders can assume in their advertising that your interest rate will be lower when it resets than when you take out the loan.\nHowever, the APR on an adjustable-rate mortgage is only an estimate, because no one can predict what will happen to interest rates over your loan term. Your APR on an ARM will only be knowable after you\u2019ve paid off the loan.\nUsing APR to Compare Mortgage Offers\nComparing APRs is not the best way to evaluate mortgage offers. Instead, it\u2019s more useful as a regulatory tool to protect consumers against misleading advertising.\nFederal Regulation Z, the Truth in Lending Act, requires lenders to disclose a loan\u2019s APR when they advertise its interest rate. As a result, when you\u2019re checking out lenders\u2019 websites to see who might give you the best interest rate, you\u2019ll be able to tell from looking at the APR if the lender with the great interest rate is going to charge you a bunch of fees, making the deal not so great after all.\nPage 3 of the loan estimate that lenders are required to give you when you apply for a mortgage shows the loan\u2019s APR. By comparing loan estimates (mortgage offers), you can easily compare APRs.\nStill, most borrowers shouldn\u2019t use APRs as a comparison tool because most of us don\u2019t get a single mortgage and keep it until it\u2019s paid off. Instead, we sell or refinance our homes every few years and end up with a different mortgage.\nIf you\u2019re looking at two loans and one has a lower interest rate but higher fees, and the other has a higher interest rate but lower fees, you might discover that the loan with the higher APR is actually less expensive if you\u2019re keeping the loan for a shorter term, as the table below illustrates.\nYou\u2019ll need to use a calculator and do the math on the actual offers lenders are giving you to make this comparison for your own situation and see which offer benefits you the most, given how long you expect to keep your loan. Keep in mind that economic and life circumstances can change, and you might not end up moving or refinancing in a few years even if that\u2019s your plan now.\nWhich Loan Is Cheaper? Interest Rate vs. APR\n| | | ||\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Time into loan | Total costs [(interest+principal)*months]+ fees | Total costs [(interest+principal)*months]+ fees | Difference |\n| 3 years | ($843*36) + $10,000 = $40,348 | ($886*36) + $4,000 = $35,896 | $4,452: Loan 2 is cheaper |\n| 5 years | ($843*60) + $10,000 = $60,580 | ($886*60) + $4,000 = $57,160 | $3,420: Loan 2 is cheaper |\n| 7 years | ($843*84) + $10,000 = $80,812 | ($886*84) + $4,000 = $78,424 | $2,388: Loan 2 is cheaper |\n| 10 years | ($843*120) + $10,000 = $111,160 | ($886*120) + $4,000 = $110,320 | $840: Loan 2 is cheaper |\n| 11 years, 8 months | ($843*140) + $10,000 = $128,020 | ($886*140) + $4,000 = $128,040 | $20: Loan 1 is cheaper |\n| 15 years | ($843*180) + $10,000 = $161,740 | ($886*180) + $4,000 = $163,480 | $1,740: Loan 1 is cheaper |\n| 30 years | ($843*360) + $10,000 = $313,480 | ($886*360) + $4,000 = $322,960 | $9,480: Loan 1 is cheaper |\nEventually, you might pay off your mortgage and own your home free and clear, ideally before retirement\u2014unless you\u2019re the type who\u2019s happy to carry a low-rate mortgage so you can have extra cash to invest (with the hope of earning a higher return than your mortgage rate).\nBut each time you get a new loan, you pay closing costs all over again, except in the case of a no-closing-cost refinance. That means all the loan fees you pay should really be averaged out over, say, five years or however long you think you\u2019ll keep the loan, not 15 or 30 years, to give you an accurate APR. You can do this math yourself with an online APR calculator. This same logic can help you determine whether it makes sense to pay mortgage points.\nLoan Estimates, APRs and 5-Year Costs\nYour loan estimate accounts for the possibility that you won\u2019t keep your loan for its full term by showing how much the loan will cost you in principal, interest, mortgage insurance and loan fees over the first five years. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll keep your loan forever, comparing five-year costs can be more useful than comparing APRs. The five-year cost also appears on Page 3 of the loan estimate, right above APR.\nIf you do use APR to compare mortgage offers, make sure you\u2019re comparing offers for the exact same type of mortgage. Don\u2019t compare the APR on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage to the APR on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, or to the APR on a 5/1 ARM, because the comparison won\u2019t tell you anything.\nThat said, one situation where comparing APRs on slightly different mortgage types can be useful is when comparing a conventional 30-year loan to an FHA 30-year loan. The APR can give you an idea of how much more expensive the FHA loan may be due to its upfront and monthly mortgage insurance premiums.\nWhat Fees Are Included in Mortgage APR?\nFederal law requires lenders to include these charges in a mortgage APR:\nAPR may also include prepaid interest, any loan application fee, any underwriting fee and other lender charges.\nFederal law says lenders should not include these finance charges in a mortgage APR:\n- Title examination and title insurance fees\n- Closing agent\u2019s loan document preparation fees\n- Escrowed amounts for property taxes and homeowners insurance\n- Notary fees\n- Home appraisal fees\n- Pest inspection fees\n- Flood hazard determination fees\n- Credit report fees\n- Settlement or escrow agent fees\n- Attorney fees\n- Government-imposed recording fees\n- Government-imposed property transfer tax\nAll of these fees are third-party fees: The money you pay for them does not go to the lender. It goes to the title insurance company, the notary, the home appraiser and so on. That said, lenders often select affiliated service providers that they have a financial incentive to work with. For example, Quicken Loans, the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lender by origination volume (number of loans closed), is affiliated with Amrock, a title insurance, mortgage settlement and home appraisal company.\nBorrowers are free to choose which providers to work with for some of these services, which means that the borrower and the third-party providers, not the lender, ultimately control these costs. You might not be able to choose whether to pay them, but you might be able to influence how much you pay for them.\nTo see which services you can shop for, look at your loan estimate. These services are allowed to vary by lender. Title insurance is one item you can often choose the provider for.\nThe reality is that lenders won\u2019t always charge the exact same set of fees. They might even differ in what they choose to include in APR. So it\u2019s also important to ask your lender which fees are included in its APR if you want to have any hope of accurately comparing APRs between lenders. And remember that APR is only one factor that affects how much house you can afford."

      "text": "If you\u2019re a veteran in the market for a new house, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re considering a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan. And with good reason: A VA loan can help you finance a home purchase for as little as $0 down, even if your credit isn\u2019t in great shape, without having to pay mortgage insurance.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any cost to this option. If you choose to borrow a VA home loan, you\u2019ll have to pay a VA funding fee. The size of that fee will depend on a few factors, including the size of your down payment.\nBefore you get too far in the mortgage process, learn more about the VA funding fee and how you should budget for this potential loan cost.\nWhat Is the VA Funding Fee?\nVA loans are issued by private banks and lenders, but they\u2019re partially backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. That means if a borrower fails to repay the loan, the federal government pays a portion of those funds so that the issuing lender isn\u2019t out the entire remaining balance.\nVA loans also are reusable, meaning you can use your full VA entitlement\u2014the maximum amount the Veterans Administration will pay your lender if you default on your mortgage loan\u2014over and over again as long as you pay off the loan every time. This entitlement or guarantee reduces the lender\u2019s risk of approving a loan for a borrower who may have no down payment and a below-average credit score.\nIn order to support this loan program and ensure it remains sustainable, VA loans require a funding fee. This is a one-time charge that you have to pay at closing on a VA loan used to buy, build, improve or repair a home, or when refinancing an existing VA mortgage, unless you meet certain requirements.\nHow Much Is the VA Loan Funding Fee?\nVA loan funding fees fluctuate over time. As of January 2024, VA loan funding fees for VA-backed purchase and construction loans are as follows:\n| DOWN PAYMENT | FIRST-TIME VA LOAN BORROWER FEE | SUBSEQUENT VA LOAN BORROWER FEE |\n|---|---|---|\n| Less than 5% | 2.15% | 3.3% |\n| 5% more | 1.5% | 1.5% |\n| 10% or more | 1.25% | 1.25% |\nThe amount you are charged for the VA funding fee depends on how much money you put toward a down payment, as well as whether or not you\u2019ve used a VA loan before. If you\u2019ve used your full VA entitlement in the past, future uses are considered \u201csubsequent.\u201d\nSay, for example, you are a first-time VA loan borrower who puts no money down on a $250,000 loan. You can expect to pay a fee of $5,375 (2.15%). If you put down 10% instead\u2014$25,000\u2014you would be charged a fee of $2,812.50 (1.25%) on the remaining $225,000.\nKeep in mind these fees apply to purchase and construction loans only. If you\u2019re doing a VA cash-out refinance, first-time borrowers pay a 2.15% funding fee and subsequent borrowers pay 3.3%.\nMeanwhile, VA streamline refinances (also known as Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loans, or IRRRLs) charge a lower funding fee of just 0.50%.\nVA Funding Fee Exemptions\nNot all VA borrowers are required to pay the funding fee. As of 2024, you are exempt from the fee if you are:\n- Receiving compensation for a service-connected disability\n- Entitled to compensation for a service-connected disability, but you\u2019re receiving retirement or active-duty pay instead\n- Receiving Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) as a surviving spouse or child of a veteran\n- A service member with a proposed or memorandum rating, before the loan closing date, saying you\u2019re eligible to get compensation because of a pre-discharge disability claim\n- An active-duty service member who has received a Purple Heart (must provide evidence before or on the closing date)\nIt\u2019s possible to get the VA funding fee refunded if you later receive VA compensation for a service-connected disability. The effective date of that compensation has to be retroactive to before the date of your loan closing. For example, if you had a claim pending when you were securing your VA mortgage that was approved after the loan closed, you likely qualify for a refund.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure whether you qualify for the VA funding fee exemption, you can check your VA loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE). This document will note whether you\u2019re exempt or nonexempt. If you don\u2019t have a COE, you can apply for one on the VA loan website.\nHow To Pay the VA Funding Fee\nThe VA funding fee is due at the time the loan closes. You can pay it a couple of different ways.\nFirst, you can choose to pay the entire fee up front as part of your closing costs. That means you need to have the cash on hand at the time of closing. This option is the cheapest in the long run, though it\u2019s not always possible.\nIf you aren\u2019t able to come up with that much cash at closing, you also have the option of rolling the fee into your loan. This may be the more convenient option, but it also means you\u2019ll pay more over time since the fee is rolled into your principal balance and accrues interest.\nSay, for example, you borrow a 30-year, $250,000 VA mortgage at 6.5% interest with no money down. Your monthly principal and interest payment would be $1,580. If you had to pay a VA funding fee of 2.15%, that would be $5,375 out-of-pocket due at closing.\nHowever, if you rolled that $5,375 into your loan balance (for a grand total of $255,750 borrowed), your monthly payments would jump to $1,1616.\nRelated: Mortgage Calculator\u2014Estimate Your Monthly House Payments"
