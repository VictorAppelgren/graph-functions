      "text": "The line begins around the corner. It curls through a hedge and down Melrose, these excited young women in baggy jeans and baby tees, slicked-back center-parted buns, glossy pouts, and perfect, almond-shaped manicures, all patiently waiting for the doors of Rhode\u2019s Los Angeles pop-up to open and let them inside. It is a warm morning in February, and some have been here for hours, hoping to get that much closer to Hailey Bieber, the inspiration behind such beauty crazes as \u201cclean girl,\u201d\u201cvanilla girl,\u201dand \u201cstrawberry girl\u201d(the ingestible theme continues with \u201cglazed-donut skin,\u201d \u201clatte makeup,\u201d \u201cbrownie-glazed lips,\u201d and \u201ccinnamon-cookie-butter hair\u201d). Around 9,000 people will show up here over the course of six days for Rhode skin creams, face balms, lip glosses (or the ultra-Instagrammable phone-case holders), and more, but really they\u2019ve come for the model turned businesswoman who dreamed them up.\nWhat is it about Hailey Bieber? What makes her fans stop this particular 28-year-old on the street, paint facsimiles of her freckles on their faces, and wait in line to buy her $20 smoothie collab at Erewhon? What drives others to fixate on her flaws in comments sections, or even, she\u2019ll tell me later, follow and berate her in the street? For the former, it\u2019s her palpable warmth and kindness, her \u201990s-nostalgia-influenced style, her seemingly untampered-with good looks, and her charmed life as the devoted Mrs. Justin Bieber. From what I can tell, after several perilous hours spent online, her dissenters believe she\u2019s successfully executed an evil master plan to entrap their favorite childhood pop star into marriage and keep him from his one true love, which they believe to be his girlfriend from when he was 16, Selena Gomez. As in the case of most celebrity news, or really news in general, the negative version gets disproportionate airtime; disasters and villains sell.\nWhen I meet Hailey Bieber in March for lunch in Los Angeles at a homey neighborhood deli she and Justin frequent, the week\u2019s headlines have proclaimed that they are moving to Europe for Justin\u2019s mental health; they are in \u201ccrisis\u201d; he is \u201cmanic,\u201d \u201cdisengaged and disheveled,\u201d strange, and spiraling; and she is planning legal action against the creator of an inaccuracy-riddled video that purports to have done a Zapruder-style analysis of her preteen digital output cross-referenced with Justin Bieber concert appearances. (There has also been talk online that influencers are paid to join the pile-on.)\nHailey does not look particularly harrowed by any of this as she arrives in tiny black sunglasses, a cropped black tank top, low-slung black stretchy pants, and a black leather Phoebe Philo jacket\u2014a look that might be described as Pilates princess meets Terminator. She cheerfully orders the cinnamon roll French toast (which is exactly what it sounds like: a gloriously large cinnamon roll, halved laterally, battered and griddled) plus a black coffee to start, mushroom scramble with bacon to follow. I ask whether it\u2019s true the Biebers have plans to head for the border\u2014they wouldn\u2019t be the only ones newly flirting with expatriation\u2014and she just got back from the Saint Laurent show in Paris, which could be enough to make anyone consider an address on that side of the Atlantic. She smiles ruefully and looks away. \u201cI read that one. There\u2019s a new headline every two days that makes no sense,\u201d she says. A phalanx of paparazzi have begun to surreptitiously assemble outside. \u201cThere\u2019s no leaving LA for us,\u201d she assures me. \u201cWe love it here.\u201d Implied: despite everything. Her life is crazy, but her skin, it must be said, is perfect.\nHailey and her older sister, Alaia, were brought up in Nyack, a suburb just up the Hudson from New York City. Their mother, Kennya Baldwin, is a Brazilian-born graphic designer who met their father, the actor Stephen Baldwin, on a crosstown bus when they were both 19 and she was a student at Parsons School of Design; they were married three years later. Kennya was an early and lifelong adopter of what we\u2019d now call \u201cwellness\u201d (organic ingredients, emollients, lymphatic massage, sun protection) and instilled those principles in Hailey; Stephen, who struggled with substance abuse for a period in the \u201980s, impressed upon her the importance of self-control. It was a religious household\u2014both parents had a deep devotion to Christianity that arrived around when their daughters did. For a few years in her childhood, Hailey attended a Waldorf school that emphasized creativity and making things by hand; afterward she was homeschooled. She entered the fashion world as a model in her teens, married Justin Bieber at 21, and, finding herself launched in a new stratosphere of celebrity, a few years later started Rhode.\nRhode was a COVID-era idea, she tells me, but it had deep roots. She used her middle name, a family one from her mother\u2019s side, a reference to the woman who had taught her the importance of skin care. It would be a direct-to-consumer brand\u2014no middleman required\u2014and the product was better than anyone had expected: clean, basic formulas in attractive, minimal packaging at a decent price. \u201cI think from having worked with so many different makeup artists and trying different facialists, estheticians, all these different people,\u201d she says, \u201cI realized that it doesn\u2019t take much for you to have a good routine, and it doesn\u2019t take much for skin care to be great.\u201d\nHailey likes nothing more than a routine. She prizes preparation and does her research. I can confirm that she sleeps in layered unguents (the famed \u201cglazed donut\u201d look) and seems genuinely to want to know what you\u2019re using on your skin and why. \u201cThe number-one reason for Rhode\u2019s success is Hailey,\u201d Rhode\u2019s president, Lauren Ratner, tells me. \u201cI think the consumer is really smart, and really understands authenticity.\u201d That authenticity has driven the brand\u2019s impressive expansion. Rhode doesn\u2019t share figures, but Reuters and Business of Fashion reported in April that Hailey was exploring a sale and that Rhode could fetch more than $1 billion. That growth has had the effect of elevating her from the wife of a very famous and successful person to a very famous and successful person in her own right\u2014sort of like going from supporting act to costar. She had been a model who palled around with the other comely celebrity children, who married a pop star, who appeared in fashion campaigns, sure, but after Rhode she was that and a serious entrepreneur\u2014a beauty industry force to be reckoned with. \u201cI never, ever thought or expected it to turn into this,\u201d she says of Rhode, which will enter into a partnership with retail giant Sephora this fall, launching at stores in the US, Canada, and then the UK. \u201cIn my wildest dreams, it\u2019s already gone beyond what I would\u2019ve hoped for.\u201d\nWhen Justin announced in 2022 that he was putting his music career on pause and ceasing to tour or perform (with rare exceptions) to focus on his health, it was Rhode that kept them in the public eye. There he was a few steps behind her for the New York launch of a limited-edition lip treatment with Krispy Kreme, or posting Instagrams from a Rhode launch event in LA (he in oversized streetwear, she in figure-skimming silhouettes). The balance, it seemed, had shifted: He became, in some ways, her supporting act. And then in August of last year, they became parents, which threw their entire world off its axis.\nHailey, 28, always knew she wanted kids\u2014she thought she would have had more than one by this time. She had watched as her older sister had a baby girl in 2020, and remembers her own wild excitement at the news. But the timing wasn\u2019t right for her, she says. \u201cI was not in a place for that at all\u2026. Now I just think it happens to every person exactly when it\u2019s supposed to. I really, really, really believe that.\u201d Pregnancy transformed her in obvious physical ways, which she didn\u2019t mind: She was active and healthy, with trainers on call, and after a period of morning sickness, growing new life felt like a miracle every day. But she was surprised at how it changed her relationship to herself and how she related to the world.\n\u201cThe pregnancy was difficult for me to wrap my head around. It was a surprise, and you go through a lot of emotions,\u201d Hailey says. \u201cThere are certain warnings: Your life is never going to be the same again. It changes in good ways, but it\u2019s not going to be the same. You\u2019re never going to be just an individual without a child ever again. And you\u2019re not going to just be you and your partner, just the two of you. There was a lot for me mentally.\u201d It\u2019s the unexpected that scares her, she says, and from the very first moments, motherhood was full of it.\n\u201cGiving birth was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she says, despite having spent nine months diligently prepping. Breathing exercises, acupuncture, yoga, pelvic-floor therapy, workouts, walking, weight training: \u201cI was on that shit. I was doing everything. I felt stronger physically than I ever had before.\u201d But the spontaneous labor she hoped for didn\u2019t happen. She began leaking amniotic fluid at 39 weeks and was induced. The doctors used Pitocin, a medication that provokes contractions, and a Foley balloon, in which a catheter-like device is inserted into the uterus and inflated with saline to get the cervix to dilate: It\u2019s a famously uncomfortable combination. \u201cThat shit was so crazy. That was not fun. They broke my water. I went into labor and I labored for a few hours. No epidural, nothing.\u201d It was 18 hours from start to finish, mercifully shorter than the estimated 24, and then there he was, all seven-something pounds of him: Jack Blues Bieber, the glorious baby boy she\u2019d dreamed of, whose spirit she\u2019d felt for months.\nOnly, she was still bleeding\u2014a lot. Postpartum hemorrhage occurs in something like 1 to 5 percent of deliveries, and if not treated quickly can lead to hypovolemic shock (where the volume of blood decreases so much that your body can\u2019t get sufficient oxygen), organ failure, and death. \u201cWhich was a little bit scary,\u201d she calmly recounts, picking at her bacon, and not for the first time during our conversations I am reminded of the many occasions that Justin has cited her as a grounding, stabilizing force in an often erratic and unpredictable world. (\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of dumb things in my life,\u201d he writes to me by email, \u201cbut the smartest thing I\u2019ve ever done was marry Hailey.\u201d) \u201cI trust my doctor with my life,\u201d Hailey says. \u201cAnd so I had peace that I knew she would never let anything happen to me. But I was bleeding really badly, and people die, and the thought crosses your mind.\u201d\nThe doctors tried different medications to get her blood to clot; nothing was working. Her newborn baby was whisked away. \u201cYou start to get a little freaked out,\u201d she says. In even the best hospitals, a medical emergency can make a patient feel like a problem that doctors are racing to solve. She was reminded of the worst day of her life, when, during breakfast with Justin in Palm Springs in 2022, she experienced a transient ischemic attack, or \u201cministroke.\u201d (The cause was later revealed to be a blood clot from an undiagnosed patent foramen ovale or PFO, a small hole between the two upper chambers of her heart. She briefly lost control of her face and the ability to speak, and was hospitalized and later underwent surgery to resolve the PFO.) In the delivery room, Hailey\u2019s doctors inserted a Jada device, a vacuum apparatus that provokes uterine contractions. It hurt, and no one could guarantee this would stop the bleeding, but she had to endure the treatment for hours. \u201cI wanted to hold my baby. I wanted to be with him,\u201d she says of the fretful waiting period until she was finally in the clear.\nShe hasn\u2019t told the full story before, at least not publicly. Childbirth is often underplayed as natural, easy, intuitive, a private matter best left undiscussed in polite company, but things can go wrong, even with all of the money and access in the world, even when everything from the outside looks perfect. It feels important to her to share the truth. She says she doesn\u2019t regret a thing, and definitely wants at least one more baby, maybe more. She plans to take it \u201ca kid at a time.\u201d Because things go right too. Your partner suddenly sees you \u201clike, \u2018My woman is a god. A superhero. I could never.\u2019 \u201d She smiles. \u201cAt least that was the case for me.\u201d Says Justin of his family\u2019s expansion from two to three: \u201cI\u2019m walking in the days I always dreamed of.\u201d\nMotherhood brings you to the edge, Hailey realizes now. She worked her mental health like a muscle. She got a new therapist; she dug into her feelings; she took the placenta pills she was told might help prevent postpartum depression, and has kept taking the prenatal vitamins too. She felt the \u201chigh highs and low lows\u201d and rode the roller coaster of her hormones. It was hard: She didn\u2019t always recognize her body and struggled with postpartum body dysmorphia, \u201cself-hatred\u201d of a tenor she\u2019d never experienced before, she tells me. At her lowest she would scour cruel online comments for validation, confirmation that she looked as bad as she felt, and then get depressed when she found them, and mad at herself for looking. \u201cEvery day I have to talk to myself, like, Hailey, you had a baby,\u201d she says. \u201cYou grew a human. You birthed a human. It\u2019s okay. Give yourself grace. Give yourself time.\u201d\nHer body was a vehicle she\u2019d always had a good relationship with, thanks to a healthy diet, genetics, and a natural love of exercise. But it took longer than she expected to lose the last 15 or so pounds she\u2019d gained\u2014which she did, painstakingly, by working with a team of experts on \u201cthe building blocks,\u201d she tells me, everything from her pelvic floor to spinal and core realignment. She has had to come to terms with the fact that, just like her emotional self, her physical self will never be exactly the same. \u201cWhen people talk about \u2018bouncing back\u2019\u2014back where, because my hips are wider, my boobs are actually bigger than they were before. They did not go back. And great, I\u2019ll take it, but it\u2019s not the same body that it was before,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not the same person that you were before. You change head to toe. And I think there was a minute where I kept really hyper-fixating on getting back to what I was. And then I had to go through that acceptance of, I\u2019m not going back. So it\u2019s really about how do I want to move forward? Who do I want to be?\u201d\nWho she is today, the version of herself barreling into the future, is one she\u2019s proud of. \u201cI like who I am so much more than I ever have,\u201d she says. The word that comes up the most during our conversations is strong. She feels that strength, now that she\u2019s a mother. \u201cThere\u2019s an ease that comes with it, a confidence,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really start to give less of a fuck about so many things. You\u2019re just like, I don\u2019t have the time, actually. I don\u2019t have the energy.\u201d She has Jack to think about, an infant who depends on her every single day, whose smile reminds her of Christmas morning. (\u201cEveryone tells you that,\u201d she says, the corny thing about Christmas, \u201cbut it\u2019s really true.\u201d) \u201cHe\u2019s my priority. He is the most important thing to me.\u201d It sounds like motherhood has kept her rooted, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s been my biggest teacher so far,\u201d she says, \u201cthe biggest teacher in my relationship. You see your partner so differently.\u201d Justin is an amazing dad, she adds, a natural. \u201cI think you empathize with your parents a lot more. There\u2019s so much perspective that comes with it.\u201d\nPerspective means, in part, the long view: She\u2019s done trying to convince people who have the wrong idea about her. (Justin writes to me that Hailey is an easy target: \u201cShe\u2019s in the spotlight, and has the attention because of her effortless knack for style, business, art, and fashion. And the way she makes being a mom and wife look easy.\u201d) \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve fought so hard to try to get people to understand me, or know who I am, or see me for me. And people just don\u2019t want to sometimes,\u201d Hailey says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing you can do about that. I\u2019ve been in a position where I\u2019ve tried to tell my side of a story or correct a narrative or tell the truth of a lie and then they go, Well, she\u2019s lying. Imagine how trapping that feels.\u201d These days she has started to listen when she\u2019s told by those who love her to throw in the towel, step away from commentary, ignore all of it. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much from Justin, really. He\u2019s been doing this literally since he was a child and he has had to face the most scrutiny of any person that I know. He was like, \u2018Baby, trust me, I\u2019ve been here before many, many times. You\u2019re not going to win. There is no winning.\u2019 \u201d\nIt helps, she says, that her marriage is strong, she\u2019s happy, her husband loves her and their family. \u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d she says of most of what\u2019s written about her. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing: I have a real life. My real life is that I get to wake up to my beautiful family and my son and my friends and I have people that know me and love me and I love them.\u201d It\u2019s taken a lot of therapy to get here, and it helps to talk it through. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a processor. If I can just speak it out loud and process it, I usually can get there on my own.\u201d She gives the high sign to her security across the restaurant that we\u2019ve finished, and they start moving into gear. \u201cBeing postpartum is the most sensitive time I\u2019ve ever gone through in my life, and learning a new version of myself is very difficult,\u201d she says to me. \u201cAnd to be doing that all the while going on the internet every day and people being like, They\u2019re getting divorced and They\u2019re this and They\u2019re not happy: It is such a mindfuck. I cannot even begin to explain it. It\u2019s a crazy life to live.\u201d\nHailey found some solace in a quote from Ariana Grande, who countered criticisms about her body and weight loss for her role in Wicked by saying that she doesn\u2019t \u201cinvite it in anymore.\u201d \u201cIt was so true to me when she said that. I am in a space where I just don\u2019t accept it. I don\u2019t allow it anymore. We don\u2019t have to allow those things into our space if we don\u2019t want to.\u201d Some manage to sneak in anyway; she doesn\u2019t hand her social media entirely over to an assistant\u2014she even edits her own TikToks\u2014but she does set limits, and stays away from spaces she knows aren\u2019t good for her, to control what she can control.\nThat unfortunately doesn\u2019t include paparazzi. We have to navigate a group of them\u2014some seven or eight men, their faces obscured by enormous cameras\u2014to get to her sporty and spotless SUV. Hailey then drives us to the gated residential community she and Justin have called home for the past five years. There, we take a walk, circling a manicured park ringed by palatial estates. At its center is an empty playground. \u201cI think when he\u2019s older Jack will love this,\u201d she says. The Biebers have so far kept him away from the media, his face obscured in any images they share. Family outings have been limited. \u201cWe don\u2019t take him to a lot of places. We don\u2019t want anyone to\u2026. I mean, you\u2019ve just got to see how invasive it all is. It feels mean to put a baby into that.\u201d Almost on cue a 20-something woman who says she lives in the neighborhood appears on the path and slopes down to the picnic bench where we\u2019ve settled to ask for a selfie, plopping next to Hailey. For the third time during as many hours, she kindly acquiesces. When she\u2019s gone, Hailey raises her impeccable eyebrows (she\u2019s a client of famed brow entrepreneur Anastasia Soare, who is also, very conveniently, a neighbor). \u201cThat\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened in my neighborhood.\u201d To be fair, there isn\u2019t a ton of foot traffic.\nAt heart, Hailey is a homebody\u2014\u201ccomforting\u2026almost motherly,\u201d says Kendall Jenner, her frequent workout partner and one of her best friends since they met on a red carpet in 2012 in New York. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a hypochondriac,\u201d says Jenner, \u201cand if I was ever panicking about something, she would come in and just, like, nurture.\u201d (Jenner also describes her as \u201cgoofy,\u201d \u201cwitty,\u201d and \u201cwise beyond her years.\u201d) I ask Hailey what she does in her free time, for fun, acknowledging that for most it\u2019s putting their feet up and scrolling. She laughs, almost mystified. \u201cI\u2019m like, Damn, what\u2019s fun for me?\u201d She likes cooking, especially now that Jack is beginning to eat solids and she can experiment with recipes. \u201cI made these three-ingredient banana donut holes the other day, and he\u2019s not ready for them yet but I was just like, You\u2019re gonna love these when you\u2019re two!\u201d She loves grabbing dinner with girlfriends, or going out on date nights with Justin, and though they confess to a young married couple\u2019s love of Postmates, they\u2019re just as apt to host a horde in Palm Springs for Coachella, like they did in April (she wore a backless minidress and a new shade of Rhode peptide lip tint; he wore his usual oversized shorts and a grimace for the paparazzi).\nTaking care of her body is a big part of her life. She keeps a regular rotating schedule of strength training (\u201cI like having a butt\u201d) and sculpt classes and Pilates (both hot and reformer), sauna and cold plunge and yoga, chiropractors and breath work and stretching, facials, massages, and microneedling. Apart from all of that, she likes to stay put, at their house here, or out at their desert escape in Palm Springs, which is newly finished after a renovation. She\u2019s famous among her friends for usually being the first to have seen a new hit series all the way through. \u201cI\u2019m a cozy person. Our house is my element, and my sanctuary. It\u2019s where my heart is, for sure.\u201d It\u2019s where she feels safe, something she tells me multiple times during our day together.\nThis could sound limiting, a late-20-something confined to the grounds of her gated and guarded homes for fear of a ravaging public. But that\u2019s not it, not really. She has been busy exploring her interior world, now that Jack has blown it wide open. \u201cI cry a lot more than I did before.\u201d She\u2019s working on allowing herself to be vulnerable, \u201cto feel what I\u2019m feeling and be not okay, and be able to just really express that and feel safe with my friends to just be like, \u2018I\u2019m losing it today.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cI was so not confrontational before. It was not easy for me to express things that bothered me or when people were pushing or stepping over boundaries. And now I just feel so much more clear about, Hey, this does not work for me.\u201d (\u201cI see that in her every day,\u201d Jenner confirms. \u201cIt\u2019s been beautiful to watch.\u201d)\nWe get up from the bench and Hailey drives us back to her house, which is behind another gate and in a style that a Los Angeles real estate agent might call \u201cmodern farmhouse,\u201d though the mind reels at the farm that would be big enough to justify the designation. The driveway is choked with cars: black SUVs, splashier sports models in Day-Glo colors. Inside, we can hear the strains of a very familiar voice singing. She pauses before opening the door to the living room: \u201cI forgot Justin is recording,\u201d she says, sliding the door open an inch so their two blonde Yorkies, Piggy Lou and Oscar, can scoot out, \u201cotherwise I\u2019d say let\u2019s get cozy.\u201d\nShe kicks off her black patent block-heeled Repetto ballerinas in the hall, easy, relaxed, with a dog in her arms and the rest of the day to unwind and play with her son. Justin is still crooning inside. She smiles at the sound, a private happiness. It makes me think of something she said earlier, at the park, when I asked if she thought this vitriolic obsession with herself and her marriage would ever die down. \u201cWell, I thought seven years in it would\u2019ve already, and it hasn\u2019t. You would think after having a child, people would maybe move on, chill out a little bit, but no,\u201d she shrugs with a cheesy Who, me? grin: \u201cSo I guess these bitches are going to be mad.\u201d\nIn this story: hair, James Pecis; makeup, Hannah Murray; tailor, Gayane Mnatsakanyan.
