  "content": "President Trump set the lowest possible bar for his meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday, declaring that \u201cprobably in the first two minutes I\u2019ll know exactly whether or not a deal can get done,\u201d and insisting he was ready to walk away from the talks and let the two sides continue to fight it out.\n\nIn a rambling news conference, Mr. Trump reiterated that he planned to negotiate what he called \u201cland swaps\u201d and batted away the statements over the weekend by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that his country\u2019s Constitution prohibited him from giving away land to an invader.\n\nIn describing the meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters that \u201cI\u2019m going to Russia on Friday,\u201d and repeated a version of the same statement several minutes later. In fact, the meeting is set to take place in Alaska, which has not been part of Russia since 1867, when it was sold to the United States for $7.2 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see what he has in mind,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Putin, whom he has talked to over secure lines at least five times since he took office in January. He said he would judge \u201cif it\u2019s a fair deal.\u201d",
