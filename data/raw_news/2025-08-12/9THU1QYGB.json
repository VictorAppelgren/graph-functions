  "content": "People sitting their driving theory test will soon need to swot up on life-saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills, the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has decided.\n\nAll road users are being encouraged to learn the basics and know how to use a defibrillator in an emergency.\n\nIt's hoped the questions, which will be added to the car and motorcycle theory test in early 2026, could prevent avoidable deaths.\n\nDrivers are often first on the scene when someone suffers a cardiac arrest, says the DVSA.\n\nAdding the information into the official learning materials means that the 2.4 million learner drivers who take their theory test each year will have a better understanding of the skills to use in an emergency, it says.\n\nLearning materials have already been updated with the new content, including questions such as \"Who can use a public access defibrillator?\" - the answer being \"everyone\".\n\nA defibrillator gives a jolt of energy to the heart, which can help get it beating normally.\n\nThe devices are designed to be user-friendly, with clear instructions.\n\nIf CPR is given and a defibrillator used within the first minutes of collapse, survival rates could be as high as 70%, evidence suggests. Without it, fewer than one in 10 survive.\n\nIf someone is unconscious and not breathing normally, call 999 and start CPR straight away.\n\nThis can be \"hands-only\" CPR to deliver timely chest compressions to get blood pumping.\n\nOne of the new theory test questions is about the correct depth to push down.\n\nTo carry out a chest compression, the NHS advises:\n\u2022 None kneel next to the person and place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of their chest. Place the palm of your other hand on top of the hand that's on their chest and interlock your fingers\n\u2022 None position yourself so your shoulders are directly above your hands\n\u2022 None using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5 to 6cm (2 to 2.5 inches) on their chest\n\u2022 None keeping your hands on their chest, release the compression and allow their chest to return to its original position\n\u2022 None repeat these compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 times a minute until an ambulance arrives or for as long as you can\n\nJames Cant, chief executive of Resuscitation Council UK, said: \"We're delighted to be working with the DVSA and other partners to introduce CPR and defibrillator awareness into the driving theory test.\n\n\"By embedding these life-saving skills into such a widely taken assessment, we can help ensure that more people, from all communities, gain the knowledge and confidence to act during a cardiac arrest.\"",

      "text": "10,000 extra driving tests a month to clear backlog\n- Published\nThe transport secretary has pledged to reduce the number of learner drivers in England waiting more than five months to sit practical tests.\nHeidi Alexander said the government would aim to clear the backlog by next summer, providing at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month to help tackle the issue.\nCurrent driving test wait times are \"totally unacceptable\", she told parliament's transport committee on Wednesday.\nThere is a minimum six-month wait to book a driving test in several areas of the UK, according to data from the AA.\nThe transport secretary said the new measures would help reduce average waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026.\nIt means the government is set to miss its original target for waiting times by up eight months.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) had planned on cutting waiting times to seven weeks by the end of this year. It has blamed an \"increase in demand and a change in customers' booking behaviour\" for the backlog.\nIn order to tackle the delays, Alexander revealed plans to double training capacity so more driving examiners would be available.\nShe said she was also asking those in other DVSA roles who are qualified, but not longer examine, to temporarily \"return to the frontline\".\nShe said it would also reintroduce overtime pay incentives for everyone delivering driving tests.\nA record 1.95 million tests were booked last year, but the government would now consult on changes to the test booking system, Alexander added.\n- Published1 April\n- Published1 June 2022\n- Published23 April\nShe said there were plans to crackdown on test booking bots which she said were \"exploiting learners\".\nTest booking bots are automated software which can act much faster than a human to rapidly book an appointment on the DVSA website.\nSuch bots can secure multiple test slots and some companies have used this technology to resell driving test slots at inflated prices.\n'Massive impact on my life'\nLearner driver Millie Moyler is due to sit her test this summer - almost 18 months since she started looking for a slot in December 2023.\n\"It's had a massive impact on my life,\" the university student from High Wycombe told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nMillie said she had been held back by the delay and was \"hopeful\" she would pass her long-awaited first try in July.\nThe wait for a test used to be a mere 10 weeks, according to driving instructor Sue Howe.\n\"But since Covid, it's just so difficult to get a test,\" she told the BBC on Wednesday.\nThe instructor from Swindon said a shortage of examiners was to blame: \"If they're short of examiners, they just can't produce the tests.\"\nEmma Bush, managing director of AA Driving School, welcomed the \"further details of how the DVSA will meet its target waiting time of seven weeks by the end of the year\".\n\"Learner drivers have been dealing with frustratingly long waiting times to book a driving test since the easing of pandemic related restrictions several years ago,\" she said.\n\"Many people, particularly young people, need to pass their driving test for their job or to access education. Unblocking the system by creating extra tests will help ensure people are not being held back due to a lack of a driving licence.\"\nGet in touch\nHave you been waiting a long time for a driving test?"
