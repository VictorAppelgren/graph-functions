      "text": "First time playing the Powerball? Here's exactly how to ask the cashier for a ticket.\nThe Powerball jackpot continues to grow, reaching an estimated $1 billion ahead of the next drawing Wednesday night.\nThe current jackpot is the seventh largest U.S. lottery jackpot and third largest Powerball jackpot ever, according to lottery officials. It is second only to the $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot won in 2022 and the $1.586 billion Powerball jackpot, which was won in 2016.\nWhile there are regular Powerball players, a giant jackpot seems to get new players flocking to retailers to buy tickets \u2013 and they may not know what to say or how to play. We're here to help.\nHere\u2019s everything to know before stopping by your local store to buy a ticket.\nFeeling Lucky? Explore the Latest Lottery News & Results\nHow do you ask the cashier for a Powerball ticket?\nBuying a Powerball ticket can be a simple process if you know what you're doing.\nTo buy a ticket in-person, you can either ask for a \"Quick Pick\", where a computer will generate numbers randomly, or you can pick the numbers yourself. The cashier will also ask about \"power play.\" For an extra dollar, you may choose to \"power play,\" which multiplies all non-grand prize winnings by a factor of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10.\nFor \"Quick Pick,\" say this: \"I'd like a quick pick Powerball ticket.\" Then tell the cashier whether you want the multiplier or \"power play.\"\nTo pick your own numbers, say this: \"I'd like a Powerball ticket and I will pick my numbers.\"\nWith this option, you will fill out a playslip with your selections. Slips may also be up for grabs on the store floor, so you could fill it out before approaching the cashier. You will need to pick six Powerball numbers total: Five numbers between 1-69 and the Powerball number, which is one number between 1-26. Hand your slip to the cashier and you will receive a printout of those numbers. Again, you can choose to \"power play\" or not.\nNeed help choosing numbers? These are the most commonly drawn numbers.\nThe Powerball also offers \"double play,\" an add-on feature with a cash prize up to $10 million. For an additional $1 per play, \"double play\" gives players in select jurisdictions another chance to match Powerball numbers in a separate drawing, which happens after the regular Powerball drawing.\nHow much are Powerball tickets?\nPowerball tickets are $2 per play.\nThe \"power play\" is an additional $1 per play, and can multiply non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 times. \"Double play\" is also an additional $1 per play if selected, thus a single ticket could cost $4 if the player adds both \"power play\" and \"double play.\"\nThere are 23 states where it's allowed to buy lottery tickets with a credit card, according to NerdWallet. The other 22 states that offer the lottery can vary in what they accept for payment, from only cash to debit cards, gift cards and more. If you're unsure, check the rules for your specific state or territory.\nHow do you play Powerball? A beginner's guide to Powerball rules and potential prizes.\nHow late can you buy a Powerball ticket tonight?\nDepending on the selling jurisdiction, sales for Powerball tickets may cut off one to two hours before the drawing. Drawings are held at 10:59 p.m. ET every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday.\nHow do you find out if you won?\nFirst, remember to watch the Powerball drawing live, which is broadcast from the Florida Lottery draw studio in Tallahassee. Some local stations will air the drawings live, so check your local listings.\nYou can also stream it live on Powerball's website or watch clips on their YouTube channel.\nIf you aren't able to watch a drawing, you can always check your numbers on the Powerball's website. Enter the date range of your drawing and your numbers to see if there was a match. The Powerball will only show numbers that have won a prize.\nWhere can you buy lottery tickets?\nTickets can be purchased in-person at gas stations, convenience stores and grocery stores. Some airport terminals may also sell lottery tickets.\nYou can also order tickets online through Jackpocket, the official digital lottery courier of the USA TODAY Network, in these U.S. states: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Washington D.C. and West Virginia.

Winning Ticket is a Bearer Instrument. Note that your ticket is held in trust by Jackpocket as the courier, and a Ticket is a bearer instrument within the meaning of all applicable law, such that the holder of the ticket is presumed to be the owner of the ticket with all applicable rights in the ticket and its proceeds. Therefore, if you obtain possession of your Winning Ticket, do not lose your Ticket or allow others to possess your Ticket. Jackpocket attempts to mitigate this risk by placing the winning customer's name on the back of the Ticket following the ticket being deemed a Winning Ticket, however Jackpocket cannot be held responsible for any lost or stolen tickets or other tickets that, for whatever reason, are not in the winning customer's possession.\n9.
