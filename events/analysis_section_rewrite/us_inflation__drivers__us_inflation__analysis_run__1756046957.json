      "feedback": "Overall, the draft is cohesive at a macro-policy level and correctly ties regime shifts (inflation normalization, easing bias, a mid-4% 10Y) to AI-capex risk appetite and higher‑quality cash‑flow plays, but it needs a world‑class upgrade in structure, quantification, and sourcing discipline. Actionable edits: (1) reframe around SECTION FOCUS with a crisp, explicit causal chain from policy/FX/yields (GX057ADL7) to AI-enabled platform breadth, GMV/revenue visibility, and equity multiples, anchored by a first‑principles view of discount rates and cash flow, and explicitly state end‑to‑end mechanism and potential fragility; (2) build a formal scenario structure (Baseline Regime A; Upside: faster inflation normalization with faster easing; Downside: inflation surprise or policy misstep) with clearly defined triggers and invalidation points (e.g., a 25bp vs 50bp Sept cut, dollar strength, oil-price shifts, tariff re-escalation), and attach probabilities or ranges; (3) quantify aggressively using listed source data (Ford: 5% yield, forward P/E ~10.3x, Q2 EV segment loss ≈ $1.3B, F-Series leadership; Shopify/GMV and revenue cues from Q2’25; policy/FX/yield targets like 10Y near mid-4%); translate these into explicit impact on valuation (e.g., how much P/E or EV/EBITDA could compress/expand under each scenario); (4) sharpen the cross‑topic synthesis by adding a watch‑list of decisive signals (Sept decision path, real‑time yield curve moves, dollar trajectory, IEA oil-supply/demand prints, tariff-policy updates) with concrete thresholds; (5) reconcile conflicts and lay out bounds (oil oversupply versus inflation risk; tariff pause vs escalation; easing vs inflation persistence) and state where each signal would alter the thesis; (6) improve citation discipline by tying claims to the exact IDs (GX057ADL7 for macro-policy, J99EM2TPZ for oil, RHXDOHQQX for tariffs) and ensuring all critical data points (e.g., Shopify Q2’25 metrics) are complete and not truncated; (7) tighten prose to remove hedges and repetition and present a single, concise conclusion with a disciplined risk/return frame.",
