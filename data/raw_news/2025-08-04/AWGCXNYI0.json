  "content": "The future of B2B payments hinges on creating seamless, intelligent workflows driven by better data exchange, creating actionable context around settlement versus just chasing speed.\n\nEmbedded, integrated payment experiences that connect directly with business systems (like ERPs) are becoming more valuable than the underlying payment rail itself.\n\nB2B payment complexity lies in process, not just rails, with soft costs like reconciliation, fraud risk and workflow inefficiencies often outweighing the free hard costs of legacy systems like ACH or checks.\n\nWatch more: The Future of B2B Payments Is Embedded, Not Just Digital\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nB2B payments are the financial plumbing of the global economy. But beneath their surface of invoices, checks and ACH files lies a storm of complexity.\n\nWhile consumer payments dazzled with tap-to-pay and instant apps, B2B stayed stubbornly analog. Today, as interchange fees rise, check fraud balloons and chief financial officers hunt for efficiency, the next wave of B2B transformation may not come from the rail itself, but from the experience that surrounds it.\n\n\u201cWhen you start talking about added cost in B2B payments, you open up a can of worms,\u201d Murray Sharp, senior vice president of commercial B2B at Nuvei, told PYMNTS.\n\nThat\u2019s because B2B payments aren\u2019t just about transferring funds. They\u2019re loaded with context, obligations and information.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not just a consumer checking out online,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cYou have two systems trying to talk to each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference in the hard cost associated with money movement and the soft costs associated with the tasks and the workflow that happen in and around the payment,\u201d he added.\n\nThose soft costs are where the real pain lives. Despite digital innovation, nearly 40% of B2B payments in the United States are still made by paper check. But it\u2019s not just about resistance to change. The simplicity and universal acceptance of paper can still beat the disjointed user experience of many digital systems.\n\nIn B2B \u2014 where a transaction involves two businesses with distinct processes and platforms \u2014 that simplicity matters and is what has kept old systems alive.\n\n\u201cIf push comes to shove, you\u2019ll accept a check,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost ubiquitous. Everybody has an address or a P.O. box. You don\u2019t necessarily need tech to accept a check.\u201d\n\nThe next decade, however, is about replacing paper simplicity with digital intelligence that works just as smoothly, he said.\n\nFor B2B buyers and suppliers, the cost of a payment isn\u2019t just the fee but also the hours of manual reconciliation, the risk of fraud, the missed credit opportunities and the broken user experiences. Reconciliation can become a nightmare, especially in ACH credit push scenarios, where buyers initiate payments and remittance data is sent separately via email or portal.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an ACH credit push \u2026 you\u2019re probably hiring two or three people in the back office to reconcile those,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cAlthough ACH may be free in terms of hard costs, the soft costs can explode.\u201d\n\nAcross Europe and the United Kingdom, bank-to-bank payments have gained more traction \u2014 helped by regulation, standardization and cultural norms. In the U.S., they remain underused, often treated as an afterthought.\n\n\u201cFor most acquirers that serve B2B, bank-to-bank is treated as a secondary experience to card,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cAlmost always it\u2019s sort of a check-the-box or a throwaway.\u201d\n\nNuvei sees things differently, he said. The firm is betting on embedded experiences, where payment flows are not just digital, but deeply integrated into a business\u2019s core systems. This means connecting directly into the ERP \u2014 allowing invoices, payments and reconciliation to all flow in sync.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine [rails] with the software experience, it\u2019s not really the same,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing customers gladly pay higher fees \u2026 for an embedded experience that delivers them the outcomes they\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost innovation in B2B is less about a rail and more about the experience in and around the rail,\u201d he added, noting that this can include value-added services such as instant account validation to reduce errors and fraud, saved payment credentials so buyers don\u2019t need to re-enter bank data, and a unified experience where all payment types \u2014 card, ACH \u2014 are tracked in one system.\n\n\u201cCompanies want to do business with companies that are easy,\u201d Sharp said.\n\nWhy User Experience Is the Battlefield for B2B Payments\n\nOne of the most overlooked struggles in B2B is the tug-of-war between buyers and suppliers over who owns the process. Buyers want suppliers to key invoices into their portal. Suppliers want buyers to log in and pay through their own interface. The result can often be so-called portal fatigue.\n\n\u201cBoth sets of automation tools for AP and AR are designed to make the counterparty do the manual work,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that buyer-supplier relationships negotiate actual payment terms and rails when they\u2019re negotiating the agreement itself.\u201d\n\nThe fragmented experience isn\u2019t just annoying \u2014 it\u2019s inefficient and expensive. Payments get decoupled from invoices, reconciliation suffers and relationships strain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very focused on delivering this modern experience that allows for customers to take a payment on any rail via any channel and have everything tie back to their system of record,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cThe tooling is really there. What\u2019s missing is the education \u2014 and the will to change.\u201d\n\nWhat would it take for B2B payments to truly modernize?\n\nThe real value lies in data, specifically the kind that enables automation, transparency and accuracy, Sharp said. In this vision, B2B payments become part of a richer data exchange, reducing manual work and unlocking smarter workflows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less around the speed of settlement, but more around platform-to-platform connectivity,\u201d Sharp said.\n\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.",

      "text": "What keeps paper checks alive in the digital age? Despite their declining popularity for personal transactions, checks still account for nearly 40% of U.S. B2B payment volume. In fact, 68% of companies relied on checks for B2B payments in 2023, and 70% of businesses stated they have no plans to discontinue their use in the next two years.\nHowever, this persistence comes with a hefty price. Check fraud is rising, costing businesses an estimated $24 billion in 2023 \u2014 nearly double the amount recorded five years ago. Fraudsters target checks because they are easy to intercept, alter or counterfeit. According to a 2024 survey, 15,417 Bank Secrecy Act reports were tied to mail theft-related check fraud over a six-month period, amounting to $688 million in fraudulent transactions. Small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) are particularly vulnerable, with 24% reporting fraud incidents compared to 15% of the general population.\nWhy haven\u2019t businesses moved away from checks? Many perceive them as low-cost or \u201cfree,\u201d but manual processing creates hidden expenses. Time, labor and delayed payment cycles add to these costs, and fraud losses only amplify the financial burden. By contrast, digital payment systems offer advanced security features, including artificial intelligence (AI)-driven fraud detection, encryption and real-time monitoring. These tools minimize risks while providing faster transaction speeds and enhanced financial visibility.\nTransitioning to digital payments \u2014 as well as instant rails such as the RTP\u00ae network and the FedNow\u00ae Service \u2014 is more than just a fraud prevention measure \u2014 it is a way to future-proof financial operations. Businesses using instant payments report improved cash flow, lower overhead and stronger vendor relationships.\nAbout \u201cChecks at Risk: How Paper Payments Weaken Fraud Prevention\u201d\nThe \u201cMoney Mobility Tracker\u00ae,\u201d a collaboration with Ingo Payments, explores how the continued reliance on paper checks creates vulnerabilities in fraud prevention and how digital and instant payment innovations are helping businesses enhance security, reduce costs and streamline financial operations."

The upgrade brings the region onto Nuvei\u2019s global standard, giving merchants faster reconciliation, greater transparency, and improved cost efficiency.\nWith this extension, merchants gain access to the same real-time intelligence and detailed reporting available across Nuvei\u2019s global network\u2014all through a single, unified experience. At the point of authorization, they can now see the true cost of each transaction, powered by per-transaction interchange prediction data. Early adopters report a 60% reduction in manual reconciliation time, fewer fee-related inquiries, and over 8X more data points per transaction than legacy batch systems. This unlocks faster reconciliation, simplifies audit trails and compliance, and allows teams to focus on growth instead of manual investigation.\nMerchants in North America also gain access to four advanced financial reports previously available only in other regions, including Balance Reports, Settlement Summary, Chargeback Reports, and Movement Reports, delivering deeper insight and stronger cash flow forecasting.\n\u201cModernizing our North American infrastructure with our proprietary clearing and settlement capabilities is a major milestone for Nuvei,\u201d said Phil Fayer, Chair and CEO at Nuvei. \u201cMerchants in the U.S. and Canada now operate on the same platform as our customers in other global markets, gaining the transparency, consistency, and control needed to grow faster and compete globally. This update also benefits international businesses operating in North America by unifying their view across all regions, removing barriers, and supporting efficient global scale.\u201d\nImproved Transparency and Interchange Fee Visibility\nNuvei\u2019s proprietary platform gives merchants real-time, transaction-level visibility into how funds move and settle, including per-transaction insights into interchange fees powered by predictive data. This removes guesswork from forecasting, pricing, and margin planning, helping merchants reduce errors, improve profitability, and better anticipate financial performance.\nRules and reconciliation logic are automatically updated, removing manual effort and giving finance teams access to more accurate and timely data. Nuvei is also piloting AI-powered fee modeling to help merchants better forecast and optimize transaction costs.\nChargeback management is now fully integrated into the Nuvei Control Panel. Through direct connection to the card schemes, merchants gain full visibility into the chargeback lifecycle, including the ability to upload supporting documentation and interact directly with agents to contest disputes and resolve issues faster.\nUnified Global View Through Nuvei Control Panel\nAll clearing and settlement capabilities are managed via the Nuvei Control Panel - an intuitive, single-login interface that gives merchants end-to-end visibility across all markets, payment types, and currencies.\nThis eliminates fragmented tools and regional workflows, replacing them with a consistent user experience and unified reporting structure. Finance and operations teams spend less time resolving mismatches or investigating discrepancies and more time driving strategy.\nWhether managing global operations or focused on North America, merchants benefit from improved audit trails, simplified reconciliation, and scalable global consistency. Transaction-level data provides the granularity needed to track variances, analyze fee structures, and align finance operations across markets.\nFoundation for Future Platform Innovation\nThis expansion builds on Nuvei\u2019s recent investments in direct local acquiring capabilities in Canada and PINless debit and Least Cost Routing, supporting the company\u2019s broader goal of building a fully integrated global payments platform, reducing third-party reliance, boosting approval rates, and enabling more predictable, data-rich operations.\nThis modernization also sets the stage for upcoming innovations including programmable settlement flows, treasury optimization tools, real-time payouts, and next-gen clearing capabilities such as digital asset and stablecoin support, enabling merchants to move money faster, reduce costs, and unlock new growth opportunities globally.\nAbout Nuvei\nNuvei is accelerating the business of clients around the world. Nuvei\u2019s modular, flexible, and scalable technology allows leading companies to accept next-gen payments, offer all payout options, and benefit from card issuing, banking, risk, and fraud management services. Connecting businesses to their customers in more than 200 markets, with local acquiring in 50 markets, 150 currencies, and 720 alternative payment methods, Nuvei provides the technology and insights for customers and partners to succeed locally and globally with one integration.\nMONTREAL, July 24, 2025 \u2013 Nuvei today announced the addition of PINless debit and Least Cost Routing to its Authorization Optimization suite, improving its authorization rate for merchants in North America by up to 3.5 percentage points for applicable transactions.\nPINless debit and least cost routing are available now in the U.S., enabling eligible transactions to bypass traditional card rails in favor of lower-cost local debit networks. Nuvei continues to invest in foundational technology that uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to improve payment routing, augment transaction flows, and optimize revenue recovery.\n\u201cThese enhancements give merchants access to debit networks that can deliver both higher approval rates and lower processing costs,\u201d said Phil Fayer, Chair and CEO of Nuvei. \u201cOur smart routing engine gives merchants the flexibility to prioritize maximum approvals or cost efficiency based on their business objectives. It\u2019s about putting optimization in their hands and helping them turn payments into profit.\u201d\nThese enhancements are a key part of Nuvei\u2019s strategy to expand its footprint in North America by delivering locally optimized performance. As regulatory changes, issuer behavior, and consumer payment preferences evolve across the region, Nuvei\u2019s intelligent routing and authorization tools give merchants the control and flexibility needed to drive higher approvals, lower costs, and accelerate growth in one of the world\u2019s most competitive payments markets.\nSmarter Routing That Drives Revenue\nNuvei\u2019s smart routing engine uses real-time AI and machine learning to analyze every transaction and determine the most effective path to approval based on issuer behavior, network logic, card metadata, and regional preferences. Key routing capabilities include:\nIntelligent Routing \u2013 Routes transactions through the best-performing bank or card network\nPINless Debit Routing (U.S.) \u2013 Routes eligible debit cards through lower-cost networks, with fallback to Visa/Mastercard\nWith debit transactions now making up over 53% of online card volumes in North America and recent regulatory changes enabling multi-network routing, Nuvei\u2019s enhanced smart routing helps merchants optimize margin, performance, and speed without adding operational complexity.\nIntelligent Authorization That Maximizes Conversion\nNuvei\u2019s intelligent authorization stack ensures that once a transaction reaches the right place, it has the highest possible chance of being approved. These features work together to reduce friction, resolve soft declines, and adapt in real time to issuer requirements:\nSmart Auth Messaging \u2013 Dynamically configures payloads and message formats based on issuer-specific logic\nNetwork Tokens \u2013 Increases issuer trust and compatibility through Visa and Mastercard network tokens\nOne-Click Payments \u2013 Accelerates repeat transactions with frictionless token-based experiences\nSmart Retry That Recovers Revenue Instantly\nIf a transaction fails, Nuvei\u2019s Smart Retry capabilities step in to recover revenue in real time, with no disruption to the customer experience. Built into the Authorization Optimization Suite, Smart Retry uses advanced decisioning logic to analyze failure reasons and automatically reattempt transactions through the most promising alternate paths.\nNuvei\u2019s Smart Retry engine includes:\nAccount Updater \u2013 Automatically refreshes expired or replaced card credentials\nBank Failover Routing \u2013 Routes the transaction to a backup bank or APM if the primary path declines\nAuth Reconfiguration \u2013 Modifies message format dynamically based on issuer response codes\nFull Visibility and Control with AI-Powered Insights\nNuvei\u2019s Control Layer provides merchants with deep visibility into performance, real-time alerts, and actionable analytics.

Failure to satisfy the remaining conditions to the completion of the Arrangement may result in the Arrangement not being completed on the proposed terms, or at all. In addition, if the Arrangement is not completed, and the Company continues as a publicly-traded entity, there are risks that the announcement of the Arrangement and the dedication of substantial resources of the Company to the completion of the Arrangement could have an impact on its business and strategic relationships (including with future and prospective employees, customers, suppliers and partners), operating results and activities in general, and could have a material adverse effect on its current and future operations, financial condition and prospects.

Unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise indicates, the Forward-looking information contained herein represents the Company\u2019s expectations as of the date hereof or as of the date it is otherwise stated to be made, as applicable, and is subject to change after such date.

As we look to finalize our pending take-private, we are already executing on a highly compelling value creation plan, and we have initiated the process of adding 300-plus new roles across our product, technology, and commercial teams,\u201d concluded Fayer.\nFinancial Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023:\nTotal volume(a) increased by 27% to $61.3 billion from $48.2 billion;\nRevenue increased by 17% to $357.6 million from $304.9 million;\nNet income increased to $17.2 million from a net loss of $18.1 million;\nAdjusted EBITDA(b) decreased by 2% to $108.8 million from $110.7 million;\nAdjusted net income(b) decreased by 8% to $52.3 million from $56.8 million;\nNet income per diluted share increased to $0.10 from a net loss per diluted share of $0.14;\nAdjusted net income per diluted share(b) decreased by 13% to $0.34 from $0.39;\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures(b) decreased to $92.6 million from $97.5 million.\nFinancial Highlights for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023:\nTotal volume(a) increased by 30% to $183.1 billion from $141.2 billion;\nRevenue increased 20% to $1,038.2 million from $868.4 million;\nNet income increased to $17.8 million from a net loss of $14.8 million;\nAdjusted EBITDA(b) increased by 7% to $340.4 million from $317.3 million;\nAdjusted net income(b) decreased by 1% to $177.4 million from $179.3 million;\nNet income per diluted share increased to $0.08 from a net loss per diluted share of $0.14;\nAdjusted net income per diluted share(b) decreased by 4% to $1.16 from $1.21;\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures(b)increased by 4% to $288.0 million from $277.0 million; and,\nCash dividends declared were $42.3 million.\n(a) Total volume does not represent revenue earned by the Company, but rather the total dollar value of transactions processed by merchants under contractual agreement with the Company. See \u201cNon-IFRS and Other Financial Measures\u201d.\n(b) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures are non-IFRS measures and non-IFRS ratios. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. See \u201cNon-IFRS and Other Financial Measures\u201d.\nProposed take private transaction\nAs previously announced, on April 1, 2024 the Company entered into a definitive arrangement agreement to be taken private by Advent International (\u201cAdvent\u201d), one of the world\u2019s largest and most experienced global private equity investors, as well as a longstanding sponsor in the payments space, alongside existing Canadian shareholders Philip Fayer, certain investment funds managed by Novacap Management Inc. and Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, in an all-cash transaction which values the Company at an enterprise value of approximately $6.3 billion (the \u201cProposed transaction\u201d). Advent will acquire all the issued and outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares and any Multiple Voting Shares (collectively the \u201cShares\u201d) that are not Rollover Shares , for a price of $34.00 per Share, in cash. This price represents an attractive and significant premium of approximately 56% to the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) on March 15, 2024, the last trading day prior to media reports concerning a potential transaction involving the Company, and a premium of approximately 48% to the 90-day volume weighted average trading price per Subordinate Voting Share as of such date.\nThe Proposed transaction will be implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The Proposed transaction was approved by shareholders at a special meeting held on June 18, 2024 and received court approval on June 20, 2024. The Proposed transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of key regulatory approvals (a majority of which were received and/or for which the waiting period has expired as of the date hereof, with a limited number of approvals remaining outstanding), is not subject to any financing condition and, assuming the timely receipt of all required key regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nFollowing completion of the transaction, it is expected that the Subordinate Voting Shares will be delisted from each of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq and that Nuvei will cease to be a reporting issuer in all applicable Canadian jurisdictions and will deregister the Subordinate Voting Shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).\nCash Dividend\nNuvei today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized and declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per Subordinate Voting Share and Multiple Voting Share, payable on December 12, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 26, 2024. The aggregate amount of the dividend is expected to be approximately $14 million, to be funded from the Company\u2019s existing cash on hand. In accordance with the Plan of arrangement, shareholders are entitled to dividends with a record date prior to the effective date of the Proposed transaction. Should the Proposed transaction be completed before the record date, the dividend will not be paid. Accordingly, payment of the dividend will be made on December 12, 2024 if the Proposed transaction is not completed prior to the record date of November 26, 2024.\nThe Company, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar provincial or territorial legislation, designates the dividend declared for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and any future dividends, to be eligible dividends. The Company further expects to report such dividends as a dividend to U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. shareholders may be eligible for taxation as \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d and therefore may be taxable at rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A U.S. shareholder should talk to its advisor regarding such dividends, including with respect to the \u201cextraordinary dividend\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (US).\nThe declaration, timing, amount and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, as more fully described under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Information\u201d of this press release.\nConference Call, Financial Outlook and Growth Targets\nIn light of the Proposed transaction, Nuvei no longer holds earnings conference calls or provides a financial outlook or growth targets.\nAbout Nuvei\nNuvei (Nasdaq: NVEI) (TSX: NVEI) is the Canadian fintech company accelerating the business of clients around the world. Nuvei\u2019s modular, flexible and scalable technology allows leading companies to accept next-gen payments, offer all payout options and benefit from card issuing, banking, risk and fraud management services. Connecting businesses to their customers in more than 200 markets, with local acquiring in 50 markets, 150 currencies and 720 alternative payment methods, Nuvei provides the technology and insights for customers and partners to succeed locally and globally with one integration.\nNuvei\u2019s condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as issued by the IASB. The information presented in this press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and supplementary financial measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per basic share, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and Total volume. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from our perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company\u2019s financial statements reported under IFRS. These measures are used to provide investors with additional insight of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in Nuvei\u2019s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use these non-IFRS and other financial measures in the evaluation of issuers. We also use these measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. We believe these measures are important additional measures of our performance, primarily because they and similar measures are used widely among others in the payment technology industry as a means of evaluating a company\u2019s underlying operating performance.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA as a means to evaluate operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before finance costs (recovery), finance income, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, and legal settlement and other.\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures: We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures (which we define as acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a supplementary indicator of our operating performance.\nAdjusted net income: We use Adjusted net income as an indicator of business performance and profitability with our current tax and capital structure. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) before acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the related income tax expense or recovery for these items. Adjusted net income also excludes change in redemption value of liability-classified common and preferred shares, change in fair value of share repurchase liability and accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and legal settlement and other.\nNon-IFRS Financial Ratios\nAdjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share: We use Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share as an indicator of performance and profitability of our business on a per share basis. Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share means Adjusted net income less net income attributable to non-controlling interest divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, respectively. The number of share-based awards used in the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the Adjusted net income per diluted share calculation is determined using the treasury stock method as permitted under IFRS.\nSupplementary Financial Measures\nWe monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner that differs from similar key performance indicators used by other companies.\nTotal volume: We believe Total volume is an indicator of performance of our business. Total volume and similar measures are used widely among others in the payments industry as a means of evaluating a company\u2019s performance. We define Total volume as the total dollar value of transactions processed in the period by customers under contractual agreement with us. Total volume does not represent revenue earned by us. Total volume includes acquiring volume, where we are in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, gateway/technology volume, where we provide our gateway/technology services but are not in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, as well as the total dollar value of transactions processed relating to APMs and payouts. Since our revenue is primarily sales volume and transaction-based, generated from merchants\u2019 daily sales and through various fees for value-added services provided to our customers, fluctuations in Total volume will generally impact our revenue.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains \u201cforward-looking information\u201d and \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d (collectively, \u201cForward-looking information\u201d) within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

See \u201cNon-IFRS and Other Financial Measures\u201d.\n(b) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures are non-IFRS measures and non-IFRS ratios. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. See \u201cNon-IFRS and Other Financial Measures\u201d.\nProposed take private transaction\nAs previously announced, on April 1, 2024 the Company entered into a definitive arrangement agreement to be taken private by Advent International (\u201cAdvent\u201d), one of the world\u2019s largest and most experienced global private equity investors, as well as a longstanding sponsor in the payments space, alongside existing Canadian shareholders Philip Fayer, certain investment funds managed by Novacap Management Inc. and Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, in an all-cash transaction which values the Company at an enterprise value of approximately $6.3 billion (the \u201cProposed transaction\u201d). Advent will acquire all the issued and outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares and any Multiple Voting Shares (collectively the \u201cShares\u201d) that are not Rollover Shares , for a price of $34.00 per Share, in cash. This price represents an attractive and significant premium of approximately 56% to the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) on March 15, 2024, the last trading day prior to media reports concerning a potential transaction involving the Company, and a premium of approximately 48% to the 90-day volume weighted average trading price per Subordinate Voting Share as of such date.\nThe Proposed transaction will be implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The Proposed transaction was approved by shareholders at a special meeting held on June 18, 2024 and received court approval on June 20, 2024. The proposed transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of key regulatory approvals (a number of which were received and/or for which the waiting period has expired as of the date hereof, with several approvals remaining outstanding), is not subject to any financing condition and, assuming the timely receipt of all required key regulatory approvals, is expected to close in late 2024 or the first quarter of 2025.\nFollowing completion of the transaction, it is expected that the Subordinate Voting Shares will be delisted from each of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq and that Nuvei will cease to be a reporting issuer in all applicable Canadian jurisdictions and will deregister the Subordinate Voting Shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).\nCash Dividend\nNuvei today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized and declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per Subordinate Voting Share and Multiple Voting Share, payable on September 5, 2024 to shareholders of record on August 20, 2024. The aggregate amount of the dividend is expected to be approximately $14 million, to be funded from the Company\u2019s existing cash on hand.\nThe Company, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar provincial or territorial legislation, designates the dividend declared for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and any future dividends, to be eligible dividends. The Company further expects to report such dividends as a dividend to U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. shareholders may be eligible for taxation as \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d and therefore may be taxable at rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A U.S. shareholder should talk to its advisor regarding such dividends, including with respect to the \u201cextraordinary dividend\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (US).\nThe declaration, timing, amount and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, as more fully described under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Information\u201d of this press release.\nConference Call, Financial Outlook and Growth Targets\nIn light of the Proposed transaction, Nuvei no longer holds earnings conference calls or provides its financial outlook or growth targets.\nAbout Nuvei\nNuvei (Nasdaq: NVEI) (TSX: NVEI) is the Canadian fintech company accelerating the business of clients around the world. Nuvei\u2019s modular, flexible and scalable technology allows leading companies to accept next-gen payments, offer all payout options and benefit from card issuing, banking, risk and fraud management services. Connecting businesses to their customers in more than 200 markets, with local acquiring in 50 markets, 150 currencies and 716 alternative payment methods, Nuvei provides the technology and insights for customers and partners to succeed locally and globally with one integration.\nNuvei\u2019s condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as issued by the IASB. The information presented in this press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and supplementary financial measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per basic share, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and Total volume. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from our perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company\u2019s financial statements reported under IFRS. These measures are used to provide investors with additional insight of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in Nuvei\u2019s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use these non-IFRS and other financial measures in the evaluation of issuers. We also use these measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. We believe these measures are important additional measures of our performance, primarily because they and similar measures are used widely among others in the payment technology industry as a means of evaluating a company\u2019s underlying operating performance.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA as a means to evaluate operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before finance costs (recovery), finance income, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, and legal settlement and other.\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures: We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures (which we define as acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a supplementary indicator of our operating performance.\nAdjusted net income: We use Adjusted net income as an indicator of business performance and profitability with our current tax and capital structure. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) before acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the related income tax expense or recovery for these items. Adjusted net income also excludes change in redemption value of liability-classified common and preferred shares, change in fair value of share repurchase liability and accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and legal settlement and other.\nNon-IFRS Financial Ratios\nAdjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share: We use Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share as an indicator of performance and profitability of our business on a per share basis. Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share means Adjusted net income less net income attributable to non-controlling interest divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, respectively. The number of share-based awards used in the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the Adjusted net income per diluted share calculation is determined using the treasury stock method as permitted under IFRS.\nSupplementary Financial Measures\nWe monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner that differs from similar key performance indicators used by other companies.\nTotal volume: We believe Total volume is an indicator of performance of our business. Total volume and similar measures are used widely among others in the payments industry as a means of evaluating a company\u2019s performance. We define Total volume as the total dollar value of transactions processed in the period by customers under contractual agreement with us. Total volume does not represent revenue earned by us. Total volume includes acquiring volume, where we are in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, gateway/technology volume, where we provide our gateway/technology services but are not in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, as well as the total dollar value of transactions processed relating to APMs and payouts. Since our revenue is primarily sales volume and transaction-based, generated from merchants\u2019 daily sales and through various fees for value-added services provided to our customers, fluctuations in Total volume will generally impact our revenue.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains \u201cforward-looking information\u201d and \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d (collectively, \u201cForward-looking information\u201d) within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
