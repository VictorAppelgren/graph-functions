      "feedback": "The draft hits a solid regime-based framework and concrete catalysts, but to reach world-class quality it needs tighter formatting, sharper first-principles grounding, and precise, source-backed assertions. Actionable edits: (1) Enforce exactly four Movers lines (two Up, two Down) and place the Outlook/Swing Trade as a separate section, not inside the Movers; each line should be strictly: Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. Do not mix multiple drivers or long prose in a single line. (2) Ground every mover in a single, clear first-principles causal chain (policy regime tilt → cost/margins → risk premia and onshoring decisions → cross-border flows) and cite only IDs next to factual claims; for example tie EU exemptions/steel quotas to RHFWI02JT and 5M9M1KACF, CHIPS subsidies to 5M9M1KACF, India’s 50% tariff to DGG6HXUFZ, Druzhba/energy moves to CWVWSACA7, tariff receipts to DNG58CC09. (3) Replace vague or multi-element blurbs with concrete triggers and thresholds for watchlists (e.g., final EU exemption terms, CHIPS disbursement schedules, Intel equity discussions, any tariff escalations) and specify an invalidation rule per line. (4) Quantify probabilities with ranges derived from the sources (e.g., base-case 40–60%, upside 20–30%, downside 10–20%), and attach IDs to numeric claims; avoid single-point probabilities without justification. (5) Reconcile conflicting signals explicitly (e.g., government equity stake rumors vs. policy risk) by labeling as conditional per 5M9M1KACF and noting uncertainty; ensure coverage of core sources (RHFWI02JT, 9W8ZUIBDY, 5M9M1KACF, OFY11YO0I, AJTHKYXQ3, WLXM1819K, DGG6HXUFZ, CWVWSACA7, DNG58CC09). (6) Improve readability by breaking dense sentences, mapping each mover to a tidy base-case vs. alt-case tree with explicit catalysts and invalidation triggers, and ensure the Swing Trade section is included if the asset is tradable (provide Entry/Stop/Target/R-R/Trigger/Probability/Confidence) or a concise Outlook line if not; eliminate filler and ensure all factual elements are sourced.",
