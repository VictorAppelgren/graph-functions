      "feedback": "The draft violates the 4‑line rule (five lines are present) and the required 5‑field format. Remove the last “Down | 3‑6 months | 30.5‑30.8 % …” line entirely. Merge the two Up lines into one distinct scenario (e.g., “Fed cuts 1 %+ and CPI < 2 % (ust10y)”) and keep a second Up line that is not a duplicate (e.g., “Fed cuts 1 %+ and steepening of the ust2y‑ust10y spread (ust10y)”). Keep the two Down lines but rewrite them to fit the 5‑field template: “Down | 3‑6 months | Fed holds/raises rates (ust10y) and CPI > 2.7 % | Fed minutes, CPI Aug 13 | 35 %” and “Down | 3‑6 months | Rising national debt & loan‑demand contraction (ust10y, mortgage_rate) | Debt‑issuance schedule, mortgage application volumes | 20 %”. Ensure each line reads exactly: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism (include canonical handle in parentheses) | What to watch | Probability %. Remove the stray “70” confidence tag and any extra commas or fields. Add citations only where a specific fact or number is asserted (e.g., after the driver or probability). This yields four clean, actionable swing‑trade outlook lines that satisfy the format, map to canonical handles, and include catalyst windows.",
