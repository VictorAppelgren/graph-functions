  "description": "Hogsmeade has just received a facelift",
  "content": "We'll be heading back to the Wizarding World soon enough with a new Harry Potter Lego set based on Hogsmeade village, and I think this might be the best version yet.\n\nI'll admit that I was dubious to begin with. Didn't we recently get a wave of individual shops that could be combined into the ultimate Hogsmeade diorama? And weren't they already pretty great? Well, they are, but it turns out that this new Harry Potter Lego set leaves them in the dust; it's more atmospheric and detailed, crams in a lot of minifigures, and would look great as a Holiday-season display piece thanks to the snowy design.\n\nAlthough it's obviously a dead ringer for the movie design, you'll also feel right at home if you've ever been to Hogsmeade at the Universal theme parks. The most accurate version of the Three Broomsticks yet (complete with the actual three broomsticks above the lintel and that iconic wonky silhouette for the roof) is joined by Honeyduke's Sweet Shop, the Hog's Head pub, and the first Lego Zonko\u2019s Joke Shop. That means it has something for you even if you already have existing versions of Hogsmeade buildings.\n\nThis has apparently been made in the same scale as the previous Diagon Alley kit (which is available for at ), and has a similar design that can be closed up into a long 'street' scene a bit like a book nook. That means it isn't quite as detailed as Lego Gringotts Bank, which is arguably one of the best Lego sets for Potter fans, but is probably more practical to display.\n\nPersonally, I adore how it nails that Tim Burton-esque lopsidedness to the skyline; it's a distinct look that hasn't necessarily been done justice to date, at least to my mind. I enjoy the detail that has been stuffed into the store interiors as well, despite the reduced real estate; there are skulls, sweets, tills, menus, and more to be found if you look closely.\n\nLego Hogsmeade will be available to buy on September 4, 2025 via the Lego Store, but if you're a member of the free Insider program (e.g. you've signed in to the site), you'll be able to purchase it from September 1 instead.\n\nFor more toys, why not drop in on our guides to the best water guns or the best Nerf blasters?",

      "text": "Best Lego sets 2025, with expert recommendations from Star Wars to Marvel\nGet the most brick for your buck with these suggestions, chosen through hands-on experience\nIf you're trying to build a collection of the best Lego sets piece by piece, you're not exactly short on choice; there are so many options weighing down shelves at the moment that finding the right one for you can be like searching for a specific brick in a whole haystack of them. That's why the GamesRadar+ master builders and I have rounded up our favorites across a wealth of ranges.\nAll of these choices are based on first-hand experience, and we've personally reviewed each and every kit in this guide to the best Lego sets. As an example, I spent around a week constructing and critiquing our top choice \u2013 Rivendell \u2013 before putting it in pride of place on my shelf where it still stands today. (You can find out more in the 'how we test' section further down the page.) That's true for all of the models here, actually; I haven't recommended anything that we wouldn't want to buy or display ourselves.\nTo help you narrow things down even more, I've divided this page into sections based on the most popular ranges (like Star Wars and Harry Potter) alongside specs on complexity, time taken, and more. This should point you in the right direction if you're unsure how to choose the best Lego sets. Check back in occasionally, too; this guide will be updated each month with the hottest models as and when they land. There are a lot of upcoming Star Wars sets that caught my eye, for example, and I'm watching out for the teased Game Boy kit with great interest\u2026\nBenjamin has been writing about Lego for GamesRadar+ since 2018, and his bylines stretch back over a decade. He's been an avid Lego fan since he was a child, and is currently building the Great Deku Tree after finishing the Disney Castle (his white whale).\nJuly 22, 2025: New entries have been added to the 'Lego sets to look forward to in 2025' section, including Soundwave and the 3-in-1 Haunted Mansion. A 'currently testing' section has been added too. In addition, extra clarity has been added to the FAQ, how we test, and how to choose portions of this guide.\nJune 25, 2025: This page has been given an additional 'best Lego sets to come out in 2025 so far' section, complete with numerous kits that caught our eye and the reason why they were included here. New entries have been added to the 'Lego sets to look forward to in 2025' as well, because the previous ones have now launched. A 'curated by' section has also been introduced.\nMay 30, 2025: For this month's update, a 'Lego sets to look forward to in 2025' has been added to the FAQ section with a few kits that our team is excited to see.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nAlthough it looks good in pictures, this kit is jaw-dropping in person. Thanks to an abundance of hidden details and clever engineering choices, it's also a great conversation-starter that's worthy of being in pride of place.\nRead more\nBest Star Wars\nThere isn't a more iconic ship in all the Star Wars galaxy, and this kit does the idea justice at a price most of us will actually be able to afford. It doesn't skimp on detail despite that smaller size, either.\nRead more\nBest Harry Potter\nMany of the best Lego sets are conversation starters, but none more so than the Talking Sorting Hat. Besides looking fantastic, this thing will literally chat with you and sort all would-be wizards and witches into Hogwarts houses.\nRead more\nBest Marvel\nIt's surprisingly tough to find reasonably-priced Marvel sets that include every OG Avenger from the movies, so this one is already winning. However, it also recreates a downright iconic moment whilst being perfect for display or play.\nRead more\nBest Mario\nPremium kits like the Mighty Bowser are all good and well, but this Super Mario set will be a better fit for most people. Affordable yet deeply characterful, the Piranha Plant is the perfect desk or shelf buddy for any fan of the franchise.\nRead more\nBest retro\nIf you're a Lego fan of a certain age, you may remember putting the original castle together fondly\u2026 and this revised version lives up to those memories. The team's passion for its legacy is clear.\nRead more\nBest Lego set overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere's something breathtaking about this kit. Photos don't do it justice; they can't capture how sprawling, intricate, and well-considered Lego Rivendell is. It uses every trick in the company's playbook, and there's a sense of fierce creativity powering it.\nSeriously, I can't get over how good this thing looks. Lord Elrond's home bears a fearsome price tag and takes up a good chunk of real estate, but my god is it beautiful. It feels as if the team poured their collective heart and soul into the design.\n\u2705 You enjoy hidden details: Lego Rivendell is crammed with Easter eggs, and every inch hides a fun nod to the movies.\n\u2705 You want one of the prettiest Lego sets: Lego has used every trick and workaround for this kit. More importantly, it's gorgeous - those pastel roof tiles are beautiful, and the numerous trees add an eye-catching splash of autumnal color.\n\u274c You don't have much space: This kit is a sprawling build that will happily take up most of a table or shelf.\n\u274c You aren't keen on long builds: Even though I've seen some people finish it in around 15 hours, making the set took us something like 25. Be wary if you're low on time.\nFeatures: With more than 6,000 pieces and a width of 29 inches, this is a monstrously big kit that will steal the limelight in any space it occupies. Alongside three distinct dioramas that can be shown off separately or combined for a massive scene, it also comes with 15 minifigures (the Fellowship of the Ring alongside Bilbo Baggins, Elrond, Arwen, elves, and a visiting dwarf).\nBuild: Although it's not for the faint of heart due to its many pieces, 50 bags, and 20-hour build time, Lego Rivendell is all the more satisfying as a result. It's not necessarily difficult, either. Thanks to concise instructions that are incredibly clear, it avoids any kind of confusion as you put the set together section by section (the project is split into three manageable chunks).\nYou'll be kept amused by numerous facts and the daddest of dad jokes dotted throughout these books, too. Indeed, I'm disappointed that we don't see more of this in other kits.\nDesign: Sure, Lego Rivendell is an investment in terms of time and money. But good lord, the outlay is worthwhile. Few other sets are as intricate as this, and it's riddled with secrets that range from tiny maps of Middle-earth to Bilbo's red book.\nIn fact, there are more than a few cubby-holes that serve as cute little dioramas; every time you look at it, there's something new to discover. It's like the ultimate doll's house, and my nerd heart is very happy every time I visit the last homely house in the west on its shelf.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nBuild experience | Thanks to fun asides in the instruction booklets and hidden details that should delight fans, this is a joy to make. | 5/5 |\nAccessibility | It'll take you a while to build Rivendell, so even though it isn't 'complicated,' be prepared for an endurance race. It takes up loads of space, too. | 3/5 |\nInstruction quality | These are easily the best Lego instruction booklets I've ever seen. | 5/5 |\nExtra features | Rivendell is drowning in Easter eggs and hidden details that Lord of the Rings fans should adore. | 5/5 |\n\"If you ask me, Rivendell is one of the best Lego sets. As in, ever. It's a magnificent design that demonstrates everything these kits can be.\" Read more: Lego Rivendell (10316) review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nPremium quality\nThis enormous kit really is one of the most impressive and best Lego sets ever made thanks to its wealth of detail, expansive interior, and numerous minifigures from across the ages. The main downside is its astronomical price.\nIt's magic\nIt's an older and more expensive kit, but this grand rendition of Hogwarts is still one of our favorite sets because of the breath-taking scale and accuracy. The inclusion of microfigures and teeny rooms is a bonus.\nWish come true\nThe Disney World castle is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world, and it's recreated in perfect detail with this amazing kit. It really does the building justice and adds to it with an interior dedicated to different Disney characters.\nBest Lego sets: Star Wars\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOf the many spaceships flying across a galaxy far, far away, none are more iconic than Han Solo's battered pile of junk. There have been plenty of Millennium Falcon Lego sets before now, but this version of the Corellian YT freighter is much more affordable and easier to display.\nIt still packs an impressive level of detail despite being smaller, though; there's no mistaking its distinctive silhouette, even at a distance.\n\u2705 You want the most iconic Star Wars ship without breaking the bank: There are other Millennium Falcon sets out there, but this is the most reasonable in price. It doesn't compromise on quality, though.\n\u2705 You don't have lots of display space: Because this is a smaller kit that won't need an entire table to itself, it'll fit beautifully into most setups.\n\u274c You want, or already have, the bigger ones: Even though this is a fantastic kit, the bigger versions obviously boast more detail and come with a host of minifigures to crew them. Want the best of the best? Go for those.\n\u274c You're looking for a playset: Any young padawans wanting a toy they can play with will be disappointed with this one \u2013 it doesn't come off the stand and is too fragile to be carried around.\nFeatures: This is the smallest of Lego's Millennium Falcon kits at just 921 pieces, but I'd argue that it's the best for most people. For starters, it's not the mammoth undertaking the Lego UCS Millennium Falcon is, nor will it break the bank like that one does. In addition, you won't need a small warehouse to display this thing. It's a reasonable size and won't dominate the space it's in.\nBuild: In contrast to the other Falcon kits, this one isn't going to take you long to construct. You can be showing off your work within a couple of hours, and the process is pretty laid back on the whole. That doesn't mean it isn't satisfying, though. You'll spend a lot of time snapping panels together to make the ship's curves, for example, and the weighty 'click' as you connect them is oddly satisfying.\nIs it perfect? No. Certain portions are fiddly, and the instructions could be a lot clearer \u2013 it's not always obvious where you're putting new pieces. But these are niggles in the grand scheme of things. Plus, it gets a lot right; there aren't any stickers in sight, for starters.\nDesign: Even though this is the dinkiest of the four Lego Millennium Falcon sets available at the moment, it's still crammed with detail. As a case in point, there are some welcome but unnecessary Easter eggs which leave an impression precisely because they aren't needed. More specifically, you'll place studs that depict memorable scenes (such as A New Hope's holo-chess game) during the early stages of this build, but they're quickly covered up and never seen again. In much the same way, clever use of 'greebles' lend the kit that recognizably battered look without overcrowding its hull. Lego could have cut corners here, yet it didn't.\nThere are compromises, of course; the set's modest footprint makes that inevitable. There's a weird gap in the cockpit neck, for instance, and it's a shame the cockpit itself doesn't feature plastic windows. You can't display it off the stand, either. But on the whole, this Millennium Falcon achieves a lot in spite of any limitations. It looks fantastic at a distance or up close, and won't dominate your living space like the Ultimate Collector Series or Rise of Skywalker alternatives.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nBuild experience | There's something deeply satisfying about clicking the chassis into place and then covering it in greebles. | 4/5 |\nAccessibility | It's not the hardest Lego set you'll build, nor is it the easiest. There are quite a lot of small and fiddly pieces to contend with, though. | 3.5/5 |\nInstruction quality | The instructions have the thinnest of white lines around the pieces you have to add, so things could be a little clearer. | 3.5/5 |\nExtra features | Like most of the best Lego sets, this kit has lots of hidden details inside (like stud versions of the New Hope crew around the holochess table) that won't ever be seen, so are purely there for the builder's satisfaction. | 4/5 |\n\"Unless you're willing to drop a lot of money and display space, this is comfortably the best Millennium Falcon kit and one of the best Lego Star Wars sets overall. It isn't perfect, but comes pretty damn close \u2013 she's got it where it counts.\" Read more: Lego Millennium Falcon (75375) review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nBest premium\nWait, that's two mentions for the UCS Falcon in one guide? You betcha. If you have the credits to spare, you'll wind up with one of the most impressive models out there.\nBest cheap\nThis pair of BrickHeadz models is perfect as a gift for loved ones that adore Mando and his super-cute ward, Grogu. Whether it's for display or the toybox, this pair should delight fans.\nFor kids\nAlthough it's a fantastic display piece for adults thanks to its recreation of an iconic scene (plus, it includes a host of awesome minifigs), kids will adore this playset due to the many interactive elements present here.\nBest Lego sets: Harry Potter\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMost of the best Lego sets are conversation starters, but few take that as literally as the Talking Sorting Hat. Push down on the disguised lever to hear it bellow your Hogwarts House at you, with audio taken straight from the movie.\nWhen combined with a classy little stand with plaques for Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff, not to mention a minifigure of Harry and a teeny Sorting Hat, this kit is the perfect display piece.\n\u2705 You want a display piece: If you'd rather something made for display instead of a playset, this is arguably the best Harry Potter kit.\n\u2705 You want a conversation starter: It's impossible for this set not to impress your guests.\n\u274c You'd rather get Hogwarts: If you can only get one Harry Potter kit, and you'd feel glum if you didn't have Hogwarts castle itself, I'd avoid the Talking Sorting Hat.\n\u274c You want a playset: As previously mentioned, this is more of a display piece than a playset\u2026 even if it is fun to play with.\nFeatures: The main selling point of this kit is right there in the name \u2013 it talks. More specifically, it barks out quotes taken directly from the Sorcerer's Stone movie (or Philosopher's Stone, if you're in the UK). It also yells which Hogwarts House you belong in.\nWhile it can be displayed by itself, the Talking Sorting Hat comes with a stand from which to shout its decisions. This features a plaque for each house and a minifigure of Harry from his first year with a little Sorting Hat on his head.\nBuild: This is one of the more straightforward Lego kits I've cobbled together, and it'll only take you an hour or two to finish. Is it slightly tedious to slot in brown block after brown block? Sort of. But there's a thrill in seeing it all come together, and clever yet simple engineering underpins the whole thing.\nDesign: It's always amazing to see how a pile of plastic blocks can look so close to a set's inspiration, and it's no different here. This kit captures the movie version's wonky, battered, and slightly grumpy design perfectly. Even though a few stickers are used to represent patches and stitches, they're mercifully few in number and do a lot to elevate the overall build. The fact that the Talking Sorting Hat's mouth and eyebrows move when you press the top is icing on the cake.\nThe stand is a handsome thing that doesn't overshadow the rest of the set, either; it's a black and gold number with space for each Hogwarts House crest which, thankfully, are printed rather than stickered. When you throw in the Harry minifig (with the adorable little legs!) with his tiny Sorting Hat, this will certainly please fans.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nBuild experience | Because it isn't a massive nor overly complicated kit, you'll have a pretty pleasant time with this one. | 4/5 |\nAccessibility | This is a straightforward build for the most part, but there are some tricky bits when you start working on the inner mechanisms. | 3.5/5 |\nInstruction quality | There are clear red lines surrounding the pieces you have to add, so you won't feel lost. | 4/5 |\nExtra features | You won't find hidden Easter eggs here, but the fact this kit can talk makes it a winner. | 5/5 |\n\"I'd always thought that the Hogwarts kit would be my go-to Harry Potter set, but this is just delightful. It sits in pride of place on my desk.\" Read more: Lego Talking Sorting Hat review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nBest display\nThe newer, smaller Hogwarts model is probably a better purchase for most people than its larger cousin, mostly due to the fact it fits on a shelf rather than needing a whole table for display. It's just as accurate and detailed, though.\nBest premium\nIn terms of ambition, I'm not sure any Harry Potter kit comes close to Gringotts. It looks impossible, as if it's about to collapse under its own weight, but the magicians at Lego somehow make it work. It's crammed with detail as well.\nFor kids\nImaginative roleplay is a key component of any set for kids, and Potions Class is arguably best at providing that. It's carrying plenty of interactive little pieces children can use to make their brew, not to mention the likes of Snape and Hermione.\nBest Lego sets: Marvel\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere are plenty of Avengers-themed kits gracing shelves right now, but few assemble the original six like this. More importantly, it recreates one of the franchise's most iconic shots to display on your shelf or jazz up your kid's toybox.\nThat's because this kit is multitasking. Along with being an interactive set sporting plenty for children to play with (like blasters that fire studs or a bunker Hulk can bust), it's just as good at being a display piece. Transparent pieces hold the Avengers aloft in their iconic poses as they race through the Sokovian forest, giving it kinetic energy despite the minifigures being stock still.\n\u2705 You want something to display, or for your kids: This set strikes the perfect balance of being a cool display piece whilst also being ideal for kids to play with.\n\u2705 You're lacking display space: Although bigger and arguably better Marvel kits are out there, they take up a lot of real estate. This is much more manageable.\n\u274c You'd prefer the OG Avengers moment: I'm sure we'll eventually get a recreation of that shot in the original Avengers where the team forms a circle to face off against aliens.\n\u274c You want a showstopper: This is on the more modest side when it comes to Marvel sets, especially when you take the Sanctum Sanctorum, Avengers Tower, or Daily Bugle into account.\nFeatures: This kit brings us back to a simpler time where the team only has to worry about trickster gods and megalomaniacal robots. Recreating Age of Ultron's opening battle against Hydra, it includes minifigures for all six OG Avengers alongside semi-transparent stands so you can pose them mid-leap.\nIt's not a static piece, though. The blasters held by those Hydra soldiers actually fire, and you can \"Hulk smash\" a plank that hurls the diorama's bunker away.\nBuild: Seeing as it'll only take you two hours or so to build, this is a pretty accessible kit. Although the experience could have been monotonous thanks to the many white and gunmetal pieces, the designers keep switching it up to maintain your interest. I just wish the instructions were clearer.\nBeyond the fiddliness of putting your minifigs on their translucent stands, this is my one complaint.\nDesign: I've got to hand it to team Lego here \u2013 this set truly does provide something for everyone. On the one hand, kids will love playing with the core Avengers in their fight against evil thanks to interactive elements. On the other, adults are getting a handsome, dynamic display piece that's instantly recognizable.\nIt's cleverly constructed, too; minifigures are attached to the environment in smart enough ways that you barely notice the stands, and no model obscures another. There's absolutely no wasted space here.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nBuild experience | Putting the minifigures onto the translucent stands can be fiddly, but the build is a satisfying one on the whole. | 4/5 |\nAccessibility | This kit manages to find a balance between complexity and simplicity, but it does provide a challenge here and there. | 4/5 |\nInstruction quality | Unfortunately, most pieces aren't outlined or highlighted in the instruction booklet. This leaves you to play spot-the-difference. | 2/5 |\nExtra features | While you aren't going to find hidden secrets, the Hydra soldiers' blasters fire studs and the bunker can be blown up using Hulk. | 3/5 |\n\"There might be bigger and more impressive sets out there, but this one is arguably the best Marvel kit for most people thanks to how well it balances price with value\u2026 and interactivity.\" Read more: Lego The Avengers Assemble: Age of Ultron (76291) review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nBest premium\nIt's big and oh boy is it expensive, but you won't find a better premium Marvel kit. With multiple stories stuffed with references to the films alongside an army of minifigures drawn from across the Infinity Saga, this is a sight to behold.\nBest display\nIs there a more infamous glove in all of cinema? I doubt it. The Infinity Gauntlet that snapped away half of all life in the MCU is downright iconic, making it the perfect display piece for fans.\nFor kids\nBecause it includes many beloved heroes from the Infinity Saga, an airport to battle over, and a showstopper in the form of Ant Man's giant form, this ode to Civil War is a fantastic kid's playset - its begging for you to join in the fight.\nBest Lego sets: Super Mario\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nI've got a lot of time for showstopper kits like The Mighty Bowser, but sometimes all you need is a plucky little Piranha Plant like this. Mario's iconic foe looks perfect in brick form, and it's oozing character despite being just nine inches high.\nWhile it won't do much good as a toy for kids, grown up fans should look no further than this display piece. It says a lot that numerous members of the GamesRadar+ team snapped it up right away.\n\u2705 You want an affordable Mario set for adults: The Piranha Plant's middle-of-the-road pricing is greatly appreciated after expensive kits. It's designed as a display piece too, not a playset.\n\u2705 You want a small but eye-catching display piece: This will look fantastic on a shelf or desk.\n\u274c You're looking for a kids' playset: Your Piranha Plant is liable to break if played with, so it's not a good fit for children.\n\u274c You want a centerpiece: Got your eye on Mighty Bowser or the Mario and Kart set? This won't impress as much as those would.\nFeatures: This kit is a bit like Lego The Child in that it's an interactive character designed to go on a desk or your shelf. The Piranha Plant's head, mouth, and leaves can be posed as well, providing a touch more ownership over how it looks.\nAside from that, there are also some hidden Mario coins that can be put into a secret compartment, piggy bank-style. It's a cool touch that wasn't necessary, but is appreciated nonetheless.\nBuild: As a small-scale project without too much in the way of technical parts, the Lego Piranha Plant isn't going to tax you. In other words, it's ideal for anyone coming back to \u2013 or getting into \u2013 Lego as an adult.\nThe instructions aren't too bad either thanks to yellow lines surrounding pieces, and I enjoy the timeline that shows off this memorable enemy through the ages.\nDesign: I adore this cheeky chappy. Even though the set isn't very big, it's full of charm and personality. Just tilting the head to one side can imbue it with character.\nI'm impressed with how well a monster built largely of curves translates into Lego, too. This doesn't feel like a rough, best-effort approximation of a Piranha Plant; it's a faithful recreation even non-Lego fans will be happy to have on display at home.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nBuild experience | This is an easy-going process that won't take you all that long. | 5/5 |\nAccessibility | If you're returning to Lego after years away or are new to the for-adults range, this is the perfect entry-point. | 5/5 |\nInstruction quality | The instructions here are pretty easy to follow and feature a fun look back at the Piranha Plant's history. | 4/5 |\nExtra features | Being able to pose your Piranha Plant, along with the secret compartment, adds to the overall experience. | 4/5 |\n\"The Lego Piranha Plant is a relatively simple build, but one that snaps with personality once it all comes together. Those 500 pieces all work particularly hard in both value and impact on the overall figure, with each stud contributing to the finished product. Surprisingly large for its price, and with its own hidden secrets, this is a must-have for Mario fans.\" Read more: Lego Piranha Plant review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nBest premium\nThe King of the Koopas has his own, enormous Lego kit, and he's never looked better. This for-adults display piece shows off Bowser in all his glory with posable arms, eyes, mouth, and tail. In a neat touch, he can even shoot fire from his jaws.\nBest display\nIf you've been a fan of the moustachioed plumber since the SNES era, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better Mario display piece. Besides capturing the blocky look of Super Mario World perfectly, it actually moves if you crank the handle.\nFor kids\nSometimes, simple is best. This beginner box is the only way to get the interactive Mario figure, and he's the lynchpin of the entire range. The kit also has a starter course for kids to make, along with a couple of foes such as Bowser Jr.\nBest Lego sets: Retro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf there's a Lego set that deserves a hero's welcome with herald's trumpets and pageantry, it's this one. The Lion Knights' Castle is a throwback to classic kits from decades past, and it combines that nostalgia with modern advancements for the ultimate project\u2026 no matter whether you're new to Lego or a veteran of countless brick-based builds.\nThere's no denying that it's expensive. However, you're getting a lot of Lego goodness for your money here (including more minifigures than most sets combined). It is, in a word, magnificent.\n\u2705 You had the original: For those of you that owned the original Lego castles, it'll be nostalgia in brick form. This stronghold more than honors the sets that inspired it.\n\u2705 You're a Middle-Ages aficionado: Love visiting castles? Enjoy binging Lord of the Rings, D&D, or Game of Thrones? This is catnip for medieval / fantasy fans.\n\u274c You still have one of the original Lego castles: If you've got an OG Lego castle at home, this will obviously feel a bit redundant. It makes quality-of-life changes and features new minifigures, of course, but is an ode to those sets of old nonetheless.\n\u274c You're short of space: Like many of the best Lego sets, this one is suitably enormous. It can be a bit of a struggle to display, so bear that in mind before you hit the checkout.\nFeatures: Think of this set like a revival rather than a reboot. It shares a lot of DNA with the 1984 King's Castle, but builds upon it with modern advances. There's an army of 22 minifigures included within the box as well.\nBuild: This set is sizeable, but don't worry - it's not difficult to construct (aside from a drawbridge that may take a few goes to position correctly, anyway). Just because it's simple to put together doesn't mean it isn't clever, though. As per Rivendell, there are cunningly recycled elements used throughout the build.\nDesign: Crammed with hidden nooks and charming details (including a fun Easter egg for the 1978 'Yellow' Castle), this is the sort of project that's just as much fun to look at after it's finished as it is to build. The fact it can be displayed as a sprawling facade - allowing you to peek inside its many rooms and cubby-holes - or as a 'complete' building is another feather in its medieval cap.\nIn addition, there's a charming sense of narrative laced through every brick. Whether it's the varied army of minifigs or lived-in details for each room (including a medieval toilet, complete with a sponge on a stick\u2026), there's very clearly a story being told here. Discovering it as you build or after the castle is finished will delight all but the most cold-hearted soul.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nBuild experience | The wealth of Easter eggs and clever design choices make construction a joy. | 5/5 |\nAccessibility | This is a mighty task even for experienced builders. | 3.5/5 |\nInstruction quality | Thanks to clear examples and plenty of history to make fans feel misty-eyed, the instructions for Lion Knights' Castle strike a chord. | 4.5/5 |\nExtra features | There are more references, hidden details, and secret nooks than I've got time to discuss here. | 5/5 |\n\"The Lego Lion Knight\u2019s Castle is one of my favorite Lego sets to date. It\u2019s a glorious ode to the Lego castles of the '70s and '80s, and I can hardly think of a better way to celebrate Lego\u2019s 90th anniversary. It\u2019s a huge, gorgeous set, with a veritable army of classic-looking minifigs and a sublime interior, complete with a tiny cameo of the 1978 \u2018Yellow\u2019 Castle (375) that started it all. When I played with smaller Lego castles as a child, this impregnable Norman keep was the structure in my mind\u2019s eye. But even putting nostalgia to one side, it should be near the top of every Lego fan\u2019s wishlist.\" Read more: Lego Lion Knights' Castle review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nBest ship\nThis throwback is inspired by the 1987 model of the same name, but improves on the formula in almost every respect. Whether it's a sleeker body, more detailed panels for the cockpit, or a beefed up buggy, the new Blacktron is flying high.\nRoll out\nThe kit may be relatively new, but it recreates the original version of Optimus Prime from the 1980s cartoon. Lego is the perfect medium to create the Transformer; its blockiness and stark edges work well with Autobots and Deceptions alike.\nBest cheap\nPolaroid cameras have really come back around in popularity, so it's fitting that a Lego version of the beloved device is on the cards too. Along with that instantly-recognizable design, this one features Lego photos. Delightful.\nHow to choose Lego\nThere are more kits these days than anyone could know what to do with, and shopping for the best Lego sets is overwhelming as a result. Not sure where to start, or put off by the countless options? Don't worry, the GamesRadar+ team can help. We've covered sets for years now and have been Lego fans since childhood, so know a thing or two about choosing the right one for you.\nHere's what we'd recommend when hunting down Lego:\n\ud83d\udc6a Who are you buying for?\nIt may feel like an obvious question, but asking who you're buying for will help you hone in on the right kit. If you're shopping for a child, prioritize playsets (typically featuring lots of interactive elements) with a younger age-rating that promise imaginative roleplay. If you're shopping for grown-ups, take a look at models rated 18+. These are meant for display rather than play and will usually be more complex on the whole. That's not a one-size-fits-all classification because some kits are great for both audiences, but it's a start.\n\ud83e\udd29 What are you a fan of?\nThere are countless sets based on franchises nowadays from Star Wars to Wicked, so the first thing you should do after deciding who you're shopping for is deciding what you like. Chances are, you'll find a suitable kit from Lego. There are actually well over 20 brands recreated in brick form now, from Harry Potter to Gabby's Dollhouse.\n\ud83d\udcd0 How much display space do you have?\nThis may be the most important question to answer if you're buying a for-adults set; they can be pretty sizable. Make sure you check the dimensions before clicking 'buy' to avoid disappointment, because many of these models can be big.\n\ud83d\udd5c How long are you willing to spend building?\nThe coolest kits can take a long time to build, so take a look at the estimated time below each entry on this page to get an idea of what you're signing up for. Rivendell took me more than a dozen hours over several evenings, for instance, so wouldn't suit those short on time.\n\ud83c\udfd3 Is it going to be played with?\nSome Lego sets aren't made for children (honestly, I'm not just making that up) so won't hold up to play. As a case in point, Optimus Prime has a habit of coming apart at the waist if he's manhandled. Bear that in mind before buying something for your little one, or it's a one-way ticket to frustration.\nHow we test Lego\n- We've written dozens of Lego reviews\n- Our team has reported on Lego for more than six years\n- We visit toy conventions & events each year\nIt's our honor and privilege to test Lego and let you know which sets are worth buying, so we take the matter very seriously.\nTo start with, the GamesRadar+ experts (who have years of experience between them) won't ever recommend a product that they wouldn't be happy buying themselves with their own money. The cost of living is tightening purse-strings everywhere, after all, so knowing what is worth the cash comes in very handy.\nWe approach each listing on this page with distinct sections to help you understand what a kit is like quickly and easily. This includes:\n- Introduction: Our writers and I give you the basics here alongside 'buy if/don't buy if' breakdowns. This provides a TL;DR cheatsheet on whether a kit is worth your time.\n- Features: You'll find the set's elevator pitch here. What does it do differently, and are there any alternatives?\n- Build: What is the kit actually like to construct? Details on the build experience are found in this section, usually with notes on how long the set took to put together based on our first-hand experience.\n- Design: You'll find our thoughts about the look of the finished model here, with any highlights or drawbacks listed clearly.\nOnce that's done, our team uses a clear and easy-to-read ratings table. This breaks the set's individual elements down. Here's an example of what that looks like.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nBuild experience | How fun is it to put the kit together? | ?/5 |\nAccessibility | Is it easy to make? | ?/5 |\nInstruction quality | Are the instructions good, bad, or somewhere in the middle? | ?/5 |\nExtra features | What extras are hiding away in there? | ?/5 |\nIf you're curious to know more about our testing process here, be sure to check in on the full GamesRadar+ review policy. This provides details on how we write reviews for all kinds of products.\nCurrently testing\nWe're always making something here at GamesRadar+ HQ, whether it's for review or just for fun. So what are the team and I building this month? Here are our current projects:\nLego Great Deku Tree | View at Lego\nMy current project is this Legend of Zelda set that I've been eagerly awaiting for months. I'm a massive fan of the franchise and have played it since the days of Link to the Past, so any Lego kit taking us to Hyrule is a must-have in my eyes. I'm about a third of the way through at the time of writing (toward the end of July), and have already put Young Link's treehouse on display in my home office. Thus far, it's reminding me of Rivendell with its numerous asides within the instructions - always a good sign.\nBest Lego sets: FAQ\nWhat is the best Lego set of all time?\nIf I had to crown just one kit, it would either be Lego Rivendell - which has the top spot on our list of the best Lego sets overall - or the Ultimate Collector Series Millennium Falcon. The former looks beautiful, but hits the spot because it combines very clever engineering with a smart repurposing of pieces to serve different functions (those chair arms are hot dogs from old kits, for instance). It's also crammed with hidden secrets and cute little scenes, wrapped up in fan service strewn throughout the instructions.\nAs for the Falcon, it's a similar story. This is a phenomenally well-made model and brings to life one of cinema's most iconic ships in painstaking detail.\nWhich Lego sets are good for adults?\nFor those of us that are eager to get into grown-up Lego but don't know where we should start, check out the company's dedicated page. It features a wealth of options that will challenge and entertain you in equal measure. The Technic and Ultimate Collector ranges are great examples.\nI'd recommend starting small, though. Namely, it's worth checking out builds from the 'helmets' line like The Mandalorian or Luke Skywalker's Red Five helm. They're relatively simple yet awesome display pieces that aren't too overwhelming to construct. They don't take up loads of space either, making them easy to find a home for on your desk or shelf.\nWhat is the best Lego set to start with?\nIf you're looking to kick off your Lego journey, there are a couple of kits we'd point you toward. First, though, we've got to work out what you need. Are you buying for a child? If so, it'll depend on how old they are - and their interests. Young tots would do well with either the Classic range (which is essentially a box of bricks for them to do whatever they want with) or the bigger, more toddler-friendly Duplo, while kids that love to dress up as Elsa and co. should look at the Disney range.\nAs for adults, it depends what they're into - but the Botanicals series is a great entry-point. These look incredible on display but aren't a headache to construct. As for something more themed, I'd gravitate toward kits that are relatively small but rated 18+ like the Millennium Falcon, Architecture pieces, Star Wars helmets, or Book Nooks. These are simple but impressive when finished, and the latter models are particularly good for quick, satisfying results.\nWhich Lego sets should I look forward to in 2025?\nWith new kits hitting shelves each and every month, there's always something new you can look forward to when it comes to the best Lego sets. Because browsing the release schedule is a bit like staring down an avalanche, here are the kits I'd suggest keeping an eye out for.\nLego Transformers Soundwave | View at Lego\nWe already had a few Autobot kits on shelves, and these are great... but where have the Decepticons been hiding? Here's our answer. One of the coolest, most '80s Transformer ever is on his way to the Lego collection this August, and it looks fantastic.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Release date: August 4, 2025\nLego Haunted Mansion | View at Lego\nNot to be confused with the Disney ride or movie, this model is a 3-in-1 kit that can be made into the titular spooky house, a ghostly galleon, or a ghost train. It's more than enough to get me in the Halloween mood, so it's getting a shoutout here.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Release date: August 1, 2025\nLego Super Mario Prince Florian & Castle Bowser | View at Lego\nI've got a lot of fond memories playing couch co-op on Super Mario Wonder, and this set is pulled straight from the game. It's bizarre and delightful in equal measure. I'd love to see more kits based directly on the video games, so I can't ignore this one.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Release date: August 1, 2025\nLego Animal Crossing Blathers's Musuem Collection | View at Lego\nOf all the Animal Crossing kits I've seen so far, this is the first one that's made me go \"I need it right now.\" Blathers is one of my favorites, as is hunting down exhibits for his museum, so until my boy Brewster gets a model, this is getting my nod of approval.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Release date: August 1, 2025\nLego One Piece The Baratie Floating Restaurant | View at Lego\nThere are some great One Piece kits on the way, but the one that impresses me most is this monster kit. It's such a visually interesting design that immediately makes me want to explore and see what secrets I can find inside. For me, that's the sign of a great Lego set.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Release date: August 1, 2025\nLego Game Boy\nAlthough we don't know what it'll look like yet beyond a glimpse of the buttons, the fact that a Lego Game Boy is on its way was enough to make me lose my damn mind when it was revealed earlier this year. Keep an eye out for this one in October.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Release date: October, 2025\nThe best Lego sets to come out in 2025 so far\nHundreds of Lego sets arrive each and every year, but which of those can be considered the 'best?' The GamesRadar+ team and I spend a lot of time each month covering all the kits being released, and we always have opinions about them. These are our favorites so far, from January to now.\nLego How to Train Your Dragon: Toothless | View at Lego\nIs there a more adorable Lego set? I'm not sure there is. This Toothless model (released to tie in with the new live-action movie) is as cute as a goshdarn button, and I can see it selling like hotcakes. I'd be surprised if it wasn't under a lot of Christmas trees this Holiday season.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: July, 2025\nLego Nike Dunk | View at Lego\nIf you're into your fashion, this should immediately be on your radar. Nike brought out a Lego trainer (non-wearable, I'm afraid) in 2025, and the design is straight fire. It's a fun display piece or gift for the Nike fans in your household.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: July, 2025\nLego The Simpsons Krusty Burger | View at Lego\nAs a lifelong Simpsons fan that could probably spend the best part of a day quoting old episodes, I was psyched to see an all-new Lego kit based on the franchise for the first time in... well, years. Honestly, I don't know what took Lego so long to bring this back.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: June, 2025\nLego Book Nook: Hogwarts Express | View at Lego\nThe new Book Nook range that Lego's started has been one of the best in a long time; it's a neat idea that's also refreshingly novel. My favorite of the bunch would have to be the Hogwarts Express, as it feels perfect for the long and narrow format. It really does feel like you've got a little window into a scene.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: June, 2025\nLego Star Wars Jango Fett's Firespray-Class Starship | View at Lego\nIt was tricky choosing just one kit from May's release schedule, but if we had to only select a single entry, it'd be this. The Firespray hasn't been seen in Lego form for years, and this Ultimate Collector Series version does that legacy justice with a model that's as intricate as you'd hope.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: May, 2025\nMario & Standard Kart | View at Lego\nThis is a kit I honestly didn't expect to work (there are way too many curves to Mario for it to work as a Lego model, surely), but I'm happy to eat my words. Mario has never looked better than he does here, and it's a fabulous nod to the plumber that'd go nicely with Mighty Bowser and the Piranha Plant display kits.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: May, 2025\nLego The Lord of the Rings The Shire | View at Lego\nThis kit had been rumored for a long time, so it was great to finally go over hill and under hill to build Bag End in all its glory. Although it's smaller than the previous Lord of the Rings kits and your mileage on the neon green grass pieces may vary, there's no denying that it's an eye-catching kit with oodles of detail.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: April, 2025\nHogwarts Castle: The Main Tower | View at Lego\nIt's taking time, but Lego's attempt to make a full, minifigure-scale Hogwarts is coming to fruition. This is by far the most impressive kit of the bunch to date, with numerous iconic locations squirrelled away inside the most distinctive part of the castle.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: June, 2025\nLego Twilight The Cullen House | View at Lego\nThis ode to the the big-screen vampire saga caught plenty of us off guard thanks to its sudden announcement, and the build is certainly impressive. A wealth of Easter eggs and plenty of minifigures (to say nothing of a werewolf...!) made this February's standout kit by a mile.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: February, 2025\nLego Jurassic World Dinosaur Fossils: Tyrannosaurus rex | View at Lego\nThe Jurassic World fossil head display pieces have been going down a treat over the past year, so it was probably just a matter of time until a full-on skeleton hit shelves. The result is tremendously impressive, looks magnificent on display, and comes with some fan-favorite minifigures too.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: March, 2025\nLego Mario Kart Baby Peach & Grand Prix Set | View at Lego\nThe Lego Super Mario range has always been a favorite of ours, and the addition of Mario Kart double dash's down on what makes it so special - the baked-in interactivity, and the way it encourages you to create your own courses. The Grand Prix was the centerpiece of this first wave, and it gave 2025 a good start.\n\ud83d\udcc6 Released in: January, 2025\nWhat is Lego's best-selling set?\nEven though it's hard to say exactly what the best-selling Lego set is without breaking into the company's accounts, we wouldn't be surprised to find that the winner is from a major franchise. More specifically, Star Wars and Harry Potter kits dominate Lego's own bestsellers page. These fan-favorites create a lot of buzz... and understandably so.\nHowever, it's not all about pop-culture. Recreations of world monuments are always popular too, and vehicles (including those in the Technic range) have an enormous following. In fact, cars and ships make up more than a dozen entries on the bestsellers list we mentioned above.\nIt's entirely possible that something simple like the Classics Bricks and Animals pack beats the competition, though. This tried-and-tested option offers a wealth of building materials for your own designs, so it's perfect no matter whether the customer is a child or master builder.\nWant some present ideas? Be sure to drop in on these must-have gifts for gamers. As for more toys, don't miss the best Nerf blasters or the best water guns.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI've been writing about games in one form or another since 2012, and now manage GamesRadar+'s tabletop gaming and toy coverage. You'll find my grubby paws on everything from board game reviews to the latest Lego news."

      "text": "Best Nerf blasters to dominate the backyard battlefield with in 2025, chosen by experts\nBrilliant blasters for summer and beyond, to suit any budget\nSummer is well and truly here, and that means it's time to break out the best Nerf blasters. Regardless of whether you're embarking on backyard battles or taking your foam firefights indoors, tracking down the best Nerf guns for the job is a necessity. That's why the GamesRadar+ team and I have selected our favorite blasters for this guide, chosen based on personal experience.\nYou'll find options to suit any budget or age-range here as a result. Want something for your youngest kid? Try the Nerf Elite Jr. Rookie pack. Shopping for someone who's hunting down the biggest and best Nerf blasters that'll send foes running? A Nerf Infinite is your primary target. Plenty more advice on how to choose the best Nerf guns is available below, earned from years of hands-on testing. Nothing will be shown here unless we've tried it ourselves.\nBe sure to pop back later, too; unlike the best water guns, there's no use-by date for Nerf. They're great all year round, and more are on the way. I'm currently eying up the greatly expanded Gelfire range, for example, and a blaster that's high on my wishlist is the Warp Speed. It looks like an absolute monster, and I'm hoping to get it in for review soon. By the looks of things, it'll be a shoe-in for our list of the best Nerf blasters.\nBenjamin has been writing about Nerf blasters for more than five years, and he has decades of experience on top of that. A favorite of his was the original Longshot. He's currently finishing off his Nerf Infinite review.\nJuly 22, 2025: A 'how to choose' section with advice on selecting the best Nerf blasters has been added to this page, helping provide guidance on where to start when shopping for these toys.\nJune 26, 2025: This guide has been updated with a new entry and category, 'best premium Nerf blaster.' The N-Series Infinite has been chosen to fill this slot, and we've written about why it deserves a place in your collection below.\nMay 29, 2025: A new entry has been added to this page in an all-new category, 'best for siblings.' I chose the N-Series Duo Pack for this section, as it provides two blasters for the price of one.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nIf you want a fantastic all-rounder that's great for any age or situation, this is it. Building on the legacy of similar revolver-style blasters, this is more accurate and has a longer range than predecessors.\nRead more below\nFor young kids\nIf you're buying for younger Nerf warriors, the Jr. range is where you should start \u2013 and this is the best of them by a long way thanks to its superior ammo-count and accuracy. It's very affordable, too.\nRead more below\nFor grown-ups\nThis new addition to the line-up has completely changed the game - it removes the need to pick up darts after use, is rechargeable, and remains lots of fun. It's a must-have.\nRead more below\nBest long-range\nPrefer to keep your distance during backyard battles? This Nerf blaster has a particularly long reach of 120ft, making it the ultimate dart sniper rifle.\nRead more below\nFor siblings\nBuying toys for multiple kids can be an expensive headache, especially if they're prone to argue over the 'best' ones. This solves the problem with two identical but great blasters.\nRead more below\nBest premium\nThis blaster doesn't believe in the saying 'less is more.' Because it's packing a massive clip that can carry 40 darts, stopping to reload is a thing of the past here.\nRead more below\nBest Nerf blaster overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nShopping for the best Nerf blasters can feel like walking into a supermarket with no idea where things are, so I'd recommend cutting to the chase and getting this one. I've been messing about with the Agility for a few weeks now and continue to be impressed by both its versatility and accuracy. It's satisfying to use as well thanks to the pull-back primer.\nBest of all, it's affordable. This N-Series mainstay sits reliably under $10 / \u00a310, which makes it very tempting no matter who you're buying for.\n\u2705 You want the perfect all-rounder: Want a blaster that can do it all? Here it is. The Agility isn't too big, nor is it too small. It has respectable reach and accuracy too.\n\u2705 You want to keep costs down: This is one of the cheapest blasters in Nerf's arsenal, so you won't break the bank on it.\n\u274c You want something long-range: Even though the agility can fire darts a decent distance, there are better alternatives if that's important to you.\n\u274c You want somewhere to store spare darts: The Agility can only fit six darts in its revolving drum, and there's nowhere to put the other half-dozen included in the box.\nFeatures & design: It may look unassuming, but the Agility honors an illustrious legacy. Most ranges have included a revolver-style blaster over the past few years (such as the Commander RD-6 or Disruptor), and this N-Series sequel builds on that foundation. Much like its predecessors, it features a rotating barrel and a pull-back priming system. However, this time it fires N1 darts that boast greater range and are more accurate on the whole. My only quibble is that it forgoes the slam-fire mechanism of older models.\nSo far as looks go, the Agility matches other blasters in the N-Series range. That means it's a blend of eye-catching white, orange, and blue.\nPerformance: Although it's aggressively affordable, the N-Series Agility is the kind of blaster that outperforms expectations. My first thought after firing it was \"holy moly, this thing is powerful.\" Darts become a blur when they leave the barrel, and they are almost too fast to be tracked by the naked eye. They'll usually hit (or be within the ballpark of) your intended target as well.\nI found the pull-back priming system to be gratifying as well. There's something very tactile about the process, and you can get into a rhythm with it quickly. The downside is that you'll need somewhere to store your extra darts, of course, but I guess that's what pockets \u2013 or accessories you can put on the tactical rail \u2013 are for.\n\ud83c\udfc6 GamesRadar+ verdict:\nThere are options with a greater range or superior firepower, but I don't think any of them can match the Agility in its role as an all-rounder. Whoever uses it, be they young or old, won't feel left behind.\nRegardless of whether you're dipping your toe into the Nerf pond for the first time or are buying for someone who knows their way around these toys, the N-Series Agility will go down as one of the best Nerf blasters.\nRead more: Nerf N-Series Agility review\nBest Nerf blaster for younger kids\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDue to being smaller, lighter, and easier to use than other Nerf guns, the best Nerf Elite Jr. blasters are ideal for children aged six and up. However, the Rookie Pack sits at the top of that pile. For a start, it's crammed with value; along with a load of spare darts, this set contains targets to practice on. It's arguably the most satisfying to use, too.\n\u2705 Your kids find it hard to use normal Nerf blasters: The Jr. range requires less force to prime and fire, so young Nerf warriors will find them a lot easier to use.\n\u2705 You want something that'll last: Because this Nerf blaster is a decent size and is fairly accurate, your child shouldn't feel as if they've outgrown it any time soon.\n\u274c You don't want to spend too much: Even though you can get regular deals on the Nerf Jr. range, the Rookie Pack is still the most expensive of the bunch.\n\u274c Your kid doesn't struggle with 'normal' Nerf: This range is designed for use by younger children thanks to less force being needed to prime and fire, so it won't be needed if your kid is fine with normal Nerf blasters.\nFeatures & design: Like all other Jr. blasters, the Rookie requires less force to prime and fire than normal Nerf guns. Nevertheless, this one stands apart thanks to its increased ammo capacity, a stock for comfort, a scope, and practice targets for you to try your aim on. That bright blue, green, and orange colorway will make sneaking around difficult, but I'd argue there's something very charming about the design \u2013 it doesn't feel as if it's pretending to be 'realistic.'\nPerformance: Called the 'Rambler', this blaster beats other Elite Jr. equivalents in terms of functionality... and fun. To begin with, it can carry more darts at once than any other toy in the range. Along with less reloading, this means your kid can lay down a blistering rain of ammo thanks to the low pull-force on display here.\nIn addition, the Rambler is simply cooler to use than the others. Lining up your shots with the oversized but still-useful scope is a blast, and getting into a rhythm with its pump-action mechanism is oddly satisfying. It's a shame it doesn't use the clips of other Nerf guns for easier reloading, but hey ho \u2013 you win some, you lose some.\n\ud83c\udfc6 GamesRadar+ verdict:\nDo you have little ones who want to join in on Nerf battles but find it hard to use the 'proper' blasters? This is an ideal solution. The Elite Jr. range is so much easier to use than its siblings, and the Rookie Pack stands out from the crowd thanks to its eight-dart capacity and scope for more accurate shots.\nWhile other Elite toys are being phased out thanks to the new N-Series, this also seems to be sticking around for now. That means you don't need to worry about being out of date as soon as you grab the Rookie Pack.\nRead more: Nerf Elite Jr. Rookie Pack review\nBest Nerf blaster for adults\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOn paper, the Gelfire Mythic shouldn't work. Biodegradable ammunition that doesn't need cleaning up sounds too good to be true, and 'water-hydrated rounds' feel like a recipe for disaster. But in reality? This is one of the best Nerf guns we've ever used. It's not even a contest.\n\u2705 You hate picking up Nerf darts: Because the Gelfire Mythic fires water-hydrated rounds that dissolve on impact, you don't need to clean up afterward. Hooray for laziness!\n\u2705 You don't like faffing with batteries: This blaster is a rare one that can be recharged using a USB-C cable, and I'll never say no to that.\n\u274c You don't want to spend much: Due to being fitted with some fancy bells and whistles, the Gelfire Mythic will set you back a little more than other blasters.\n\u274c Everyone else uses 'normal' Nerf: This blaster fires much faster than others in the Nerf range, and it uses entirely different ammo. That gives it an unfair advantage if others are using classic Nerf.\nFeatures & design: The headline here would obviously be those gel pellets. Made from a biodegradable material that dissolves upon impact, these beads have a lot in common with Orbeez \u2013 you dunk them in water and they expand to many times their original size. A ridiculous 800 of these are then loaded into the hopper on top of the blaster.\nSpeaking of which, that blaster looks similar to Nerf's Rival range. It has many of the same perks, too; its appearance is less like an arcade raygun, it has rails for accessories, packs an extendable stock, features an adjustable rate-of-fire, and runs on a rechargeable battery. However, it stands out thanks to that battery being charged by a USB-C cable.\nPerformance: The Gelfire Mythic more than makes good on its promises. As I mentioned in my review, it's \"a mechanical marvel that changes the game\" with ammo able to go far beyond our expectations. Literally \u2013 their range is remarkable.\nThey're easy to set up, too. Simply drop these orange grains into a bucket of water, leave them for a couple of hours, and come back to find a tub of pellets that are sturdy enough to handle but will safely disintegrate after being fired. Seriously, they don't leave any sort of mess and help you avoid the dreaded dart pickup following a backyard battle. The prep is more of a faff, true, but the lack of pickup alone helps it feel as if it's the start of something big.\nIts other features are even better. Besides allowing you to forgo endless packs of AAs, it comes with the ability to spit out 10 rounds per second. Oh, and you won't need to shop for bonus ammunition anytime soon \u2013 there are 10,000 pellets in the box.\n\ud83c\udfc6 GamesRadar+ verdict:\nIf you're looking for one of the ultimate Nerf blasters, this is it. While it may be a bit much for young children (those pellets sting a little when fired up close), everyone else will be delighted with it. For pros and adults, you can't do much better.\nRead more: Nerf Pro Gelfire Mythic review\nThe best long-range Nerf blaster\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNerf has spent a long time perfecting its darts, but has only just struck gold \u2013 the ammo used in N-Series blasters like Pinpoint will go down as its best by miles. When loaded into this chic yet affordable toy, you're left with a more reliably accurate Nerf gun than we've ever seen.\n\u2705 You want reliable accuracy: Unlike other long-range blasters, this one will actually hit what you're aiming at more often than not. (Shocking, I know.)\n\u2705 You want something fun to use: It's weirdly satisfying to prime the Pinpoint's bolt-action mechanism or slam a clip of darts into the holder. That feeling doesn't get old.\n\u274c You're short on darts: Seeing as the Pinpoint offers excellent range, there's a very real chance you'll lose a dart or three. It only comes with 18 in the box, so get spares.\n\u274c You'll only use it in small spaces: Thanks to this being a long-range blaster, it's not going to shine in cramped environments.\nFeatures & design: As the name would suggest, Pinpoint is all about maximum accuracy. While you'll get better results across the board with those new and improved N1 darts, the Pinpoint pushes them to new heights thanks to a powerful bolt-action mechanism. Together with a scope and 10-dart clip for easy reloads, this is a very user-friendly option.\nThe white, blue, and orange look is certainly attention-grabbing too; while mileage will vary for some, I'd say it feels like something dragged from a sci-fi movie.\nPerformance: There's almost nothing negative I can say about the N-Series Pinpoint. This thing is one of the most accurate and satisfying Nerf blasters you're ever likely to use.\nFor starters, you'll actually hit the target you're aiming at more often than not. In the past, this\u2026 well, let's just say it was difficult to be a Nerf sharpshooter. With the Pinpoint, though, it's easy to hit your mark. In a refreshing change, the scope actually helps as well rather than being there for aesthetics only.\nNext, it's incredibly satisfying to use. The weighty ka-clunk of the bolt-action primer always puts a smile on my face, as does slamming a fresh magazine of darts into the blaster. A very occasional jam is the only downside I encountered after far too long mucking about with this in the GamesRadar+ office.\n\ud83c\udfc6 GamesRadar+ verdict:\nThere's always been a high bar for long-range Nerf blasters, and anything trying to fill that void is up against stiff competition. But the Pinpoint nails it. Thanks to a winning combo of satisfyingly tactile mechanics and unerring accuracy at a distance, I'd argue that this is the best sniper blaster Nerf has ever made.\nRead more: Nerf N-Series Pinpoint review\nBest Nerf blaster for siblings\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt can be a bit of a minefield if you've got more than one Nerf-obsessed kid at home, or you're hoping to buy your children their first blasters; arguments will inevitably spring up over who gets what. That's why the Duo Pack is punching so far above its weight. Despite being one of the cheapest options on this list, it provides two identical toys for the price of one. This nips any squabbling in the bud. Now there's bang for buck.\n\u2705 You're shopping for multiple people: You're getting two blasters for the price of one here, so the Duo Pack is great value for money.\n\u2705 Your kids argue a lot: If your children tend to have bust-ups over who gets what, this solves the problem by offering two identical blasters.\n\u274c You're buying for one person: Seeing as there are two identical blasters in this pack, it feels a little redundant if you're buying for just one person.\n\u274c You're shopping for younger kids: I wouldn't say the ring-pull mechanism on this blaster is hard to use, but young children may find it tricky.\nFeatures & design: The Duo Pack is a nice, simple combo of blasters that carry two N1 darts each (though you get 12 darts total in the box). After they're primed with a pull ring, using them is as easy as squeezing the trigger.\nI'd argue that they're some of the best-looking Nerf blasters out there too. The sleek, subtle design is a refreshing departure from their more outlandish siblings, and I appreciate the splash of red or blue paint to differentiate the two toys from one another.\nPerformance: Just like all other N-Series blasters, the Duo Pack is surprisingly punchy \u2013 ammo flies from the barrel like a bat out of hell, but the soft-tip darts mean no-one's going to get hurt. They're accurate too, for the most part; although I struggled to hit my mark when firing at something further away, these toys excel at short to mid-range.\nIn other words, they're perfect for smaller backyards, indoor battles, or as a secondary blaster that you pull out of your pocket in a pinch. Plus, they're a great choice if you're just testing the water. Not sure if your kids are going to like or get much use out of Nerf? These aren't too expensive, but still give a good indication of what it's all about.\nJust be aware that younger children may struggle to handle the ring pull. It's not tricky, per se, but it is a little stiff.\n\ud83c\udfc6 GamesRadar+ verdict:\nI'd expected these blasters to be a throwaway novelty, but they impressed me with their quality and value. If you're buying for a couple of kids or want to make your money go further, the Nerf N-Series Duo Pack is a decent choice. Yes, there are better singleton options in this price range. But none offer the same two-for-one value.\nRead more: Nerf N-Series Duo Pack review\nBest premium Nerf blaster\n6. Nerf N-Series Infinite\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSometimes, you need to go big or go home \u2013 and I'll let you guess which school of thought the Nerf N-Series Infinite subscribes to.\nAs the biggest entry in the range so far, this weapon of foam dart destruction is an intimidating sight on the backyard battlefield. Armed with more ammo than any other N-Series toy but still capable of the same accuracy, this is one of the best Nerf blasters if your budget can stretch that far.\n\u2705 You want the biggest blaster: You won't find an N-Series Nerf blaster that's bigger than the Infinite. Not yet, at least.\n\u2705 You hate reloading mid-game: Thanks to an ammo belt that can carry 40 darts (and space to store more), you're unlikely to reload much in Nerf games.\n\u274c You want something for younger kids: The sheer size of this blaster means young or particularly small children will struggle to carry it.\n\u274c You want to keep costs down: Although it's not necessarily bank-busting in cost, the Infinite is still pricier than most Nerf blasters.\nFeatures & design: The Infinite is what would happen if an '80s action hero designed a Nerf gun. This thing is big, with space for enough ammo that you can spray and pray all day. Actually, its clip holds up to 40 darts at once\u2026 and can fit more in the belt's storage area. That means firing off endless volleys is as simple as pulling the primer and squeezing that trigger.\nThe Infinite doesn't look as overbearing as this makes it sound, of course. As with all N-Series toys, it's colored orange, white, and blue in a friendly array. It's also surprisingly comfortable to use considering its size (so long as you aren't a younger or smaller child, anyway \u2013 then it'll be much too unweildy).\nPerformance: Seeing as it's an N-Series blaster and is packing N1 darts, the Infinite is noticeably more accurate than the likes of a Nerf Elite toy. It boasts a better range as well, allowing you to hit your mark much more easily in the heat of Nerf battle.\nThat's not the blaster's headline feature, though \u2013 it's the ammo capacity. With dozens of darts in the clip that are pushed into place on a rotating belt every time you prime the mechanism, you won't have to worry about reloading like everyone else. Yes, picking up after yourself once the game is over will be more of a pain. But while playing, you'll feel unstoppable. It was all I could do not to laugh maniacally while yelling \"say hello to my little friend!\" as I tested this thing out.\n\ud83c\udfc6 GamesRadar+ verdict:\nWhen you mix the Infinite's staggering ammo capacity with its range, accuracy, and comfort, you get a true winner. Even though it's more expensive than most other N-Series blasters, it's amongst the best so far as performance goes.\nHow to choose the best Nerf blasters\nLooking for the best Nerf guns but unsure of what to settle on? Don't worry, I've got you covered. The GamesRadar+ writers and I have been covering Nerf for years, so have plenty of advice on what to prioritize. Here's what I always ask myself when considering which blaster to grab next.\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc66 Who are you buying for?\nIf you can figure out the target audience, you'll narrow down the list considerably. Shopping for kids aged 7 and up? The N-Series or Elite blasters are the way to go. Buying for teens or adults? Try Gelfire, Rival, or Hyper blasters. As for young kids from 5 to 6, don't miss Nerf Elite Jr.\n\ud83c\udfe0 Where will the blaster be used?\nAlthough it's impossible to say with certainty that it'll only be used in one specific place or circumstance, it's worth bearing in mind when you're looking for Nerf blasters. If it'll only ever be used in the house or around a friends' place, getting a super long-range option like the Pinpoint might not be much use - you'd be better off with something small and mobile, such as the N-Series Agility.\n\ud83d\udd0b Do you want to avoid batteries?\nIf you're keen for minimum fuss, steering clear of blasters that require batteries is a good idea. (There's nothing worse than endlessly swapping out AAs.) It'll always state clearly on the product itself or our recommendations whether the toy in question needs power, which should give you a heads-up before checkout.\nNerf darts info & deals\nFinding the best Nerf blasters is just the beginning; unless you're happy running around picking up darts during every session, you'll need more to stay in the game for as long as possible. To help you prepare (and avoid the ignominy of pausing the game so you can gather ammo), I've broken down what Nerf darts there are here\u2026 including what they're compatible with. That's because it's crucial to buy the right darts for your blaster. Some won't work with certain Nerf toys, while others are a completely different shape or size.\nYou can find a brief overview below, with more information (along with deals) available further down the page.\nDart type | Description |\n|---|---|\nNerf N1 | This brand-new dart is the result of over a decade's testing. They fly faster and more accurately than anything we've seen before, and are only compatible with N-Series blasters. |\nNerf Elite | Bog-standard Nerf darts. They're compatible with almost everything that isn't an Ultra, Hyper, or Rival blaster. |\nNerf Gelfire | This entirely new invention differs from everything else here - the rounds are water-hydrated, so start out tiny and get bigger. Only compatible with Gelfire blasters. |\nNerf Ultra | Nerf darts that fly further than normal Elite ammo. Only compatible with Nerf Ultra blasters. |\nNerf Hyper | Because they're pellets rather than darts, these won't work in anything that isn't a Hyper blaster. |\nNerf Rival | Another set of pellets that will only fit Rival blasters (they're bigger than Hyper pellets, so won't work on those either). |\nNerf N1\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\n- Compatible with: Nerf N-Series blasters\nThese darts are the first new design in years, and they're specially made to fly further, faster, and more accurately than anything that's come before. I've been hands-on with a variety of the N-Series blasters they're built for, and these beauties really are better than anything else from Nerf.\nHowever, bear in mind that they won't work with any other kind of Nerf blaster; they'll only fit the N-Series range. The same goes both ways, as Elite or Ultra darts aren't going to work in N-Series blasters either.\nNerf Elite\n- Compatible with: Nerf Elite, Elite 2.0, Fortnite, Minecraft, DinoSquad, Zombie Strike, MicroShots, AlphaStrike, Halo, AccuStrike Elite, and Modulus blasters\nOften seen as the 'classic' Nerf dart, this is the most common and readily available ammo by a long way. That means plenty of third-party equivalents are up for grabs if you want to save money.\nBetter yet, they can be used on a vast array of blasters (but not the new N-Series). Be sure to check first, but chances are, the blaster you have at home can fire Elite darts.\nNerf Gelfire\n- Compatible with: Nerf Gelfire blasters\nThis is the most unique invention Nerf has under its belt, and it's totally different to anything else in the range. You see, these aren't darts; they're water-hydrated rounds that burst on impact. They biodegrade naturally too, so no clean-up is needed... though it should be noted that they need exposure to water for a prolonged period to be usable, so aren't an instant fix.\nJust don't try to load them into anything else. They'll only work with Nerf Gelfire blasters.\nNerf Ultra\n- Compatible with: Nerf Ultra blasters\nAlthough they won't hold up to the newer N1 darts, Ultra ammo is designed to be more accurate and have a longer reach than Nerf Elite rounds. Indeed, they're supposed to be able to go 120 feet.\nSadly, that means they won't fit into any other blaster. Want to use them on your Nerf Elite toys? Sorry, no can do. They'll only work with Nerf Ultra.\nNerf Hyper\n- Compatible with: Nerf Hyper blasters\nYou'll immediately notice what sets this ammo apart from other Nerf toys at a glance - they're balls, not darts. Used in the Hyper range for more competitive play, they're loaded via hopper rather than the usual clip or revolving barrel.\nDespite looking very similar to Nerf Rival ammo, bear in mind that Hyper rounds are not compatible with any other kind of blaster.\nNerf Rival\n- Compatible with: Nerf Rival blasters\nRival ammo is very similar to Hyper in that it's spherical rather than a dart. It's also designed for an older, more competitive scene and is fed via hopper.\nNevertheless, they can't be used in Hyper toys and are exclusive to Rival blasters. Be aware of that before hitting checkout to avoid disappointment.\nBest Nerf guns: FAQ\nWhat Nerf gun is best?\nAlthough you'll get a very different answer depending on who you ask, we'd argue that the best Nerf gun is 2022's Pro Gelfire Mythic. Packing a unique new kind of round that shatters safely on impact and leaves nothing left behind to pick up, it's an innovative design that side-steps one of the biggest problems with toys like this (finding all your darts afterward).\nHowever those wanting a more traditional blaster that balances price with performance should consider the Nerf Elite 2.0 Commander RD-6. Sure, it doesn't necessarily have a party trick either in terms of extendable stocks or removable barrels. But it still manages to hit hard and can be fired multiple times rather than having to be primed after each shot. It's not too bulky either, so younger Nerf warriors won't be weighed down (the Nerf N-Strike Elite Strongarm is also a contender for much the same reason, but that one's not so widely available anymore).\nMeanwhile, those with a larger budget should consider the Nerf Fortnite AR-L. As well as looking awesome thanks to being a perfect replica of the video game weapon, it has a motorized mechanism that allows users to fire 10 darts in quick succession. It uses the cheap Elite darts as well, so you won't have to spend a fortune stocking back up.\nWhich Nerf gun is the most powerful?\nIf you're hunting down the most powerful Nerf gun, you'll want to keep an eye out for motorized blasters. These use batteries to increase the speed at which they fire darts, allowing them to spit out ammo at a blistering pace. So far as we're concerned, few can beat the Nerf Hyper Mach 100.\nAble to fire at a rate of 110 feet per second, the Mach 100 is an absolute monster that is quicker and more precise than most rivals. You can get off-brand alternatives that can potentially outstrip it, of course, but no official Nerf gun can compare to this Hyper model. Just bear in mind that it fires foam pellets rather than darts.\nShould I buy the new Nerf N-Series?\nThanks to the introduction of Nerf N-Series in 2024, things have really changed for the toy range. Besides replacing the current, venerable 'Elite' dart with an all-new N1 alternative, it's the first major overhaul in years that isn't just a spin-off brand.\nThat's because those darts are bigger than their predecessors, which means they won't work in older blasters - and vice versa. However, they're also a lot more accurate and can fly further. That means you'll want to upgrade your gear if you want the best Nerf guns.\nThat is the reason N-Series blasters seem to be superseding what's come before; they aren't compatible with the existing ranges. Despite the older blasters sticking around (and the Pro Gelfire series still going strong), I'd guess that the N-Series/N1 darts will become the new norm in time.\nHonestly, that's no bad thing. The old Elite darts were great, but N1 is so much more accurate on the whole. I've tested them myself and the difference was immediately obvious; it's a lot easier to hit your mark.\nShould I try third-party alternatives?\nHoping to save a little money and grab one of Nerf's rival blasters? There are certainly enough to choose from. Although the likes of Xshot may be the best known (and seem to be the closest match to classic Nerf Elite toys), I've got a lot of time for the Gel Blaster Surge XL. This uses tiny water-activated pellets just like Nerf's Gelfire range, and it's every bit as satisfying to fire.\nHowever, if you want to make sure your existing darts work, it's probably best to stick with Nerf - especially if you've grabbed the N-Series range, because that ammo is exclusive to the new Nerf blasters and can't be used with anything else.\nLooking for more ways to stay entertained?

      "text": "This Lego Toothless set is going to charm the heck out of How to Train Your Dragon fans\nMark my words, this new Lego set is going to be a mega popular gift this year\nTo be perfectly honest, I think this new Lego set is bang out of order. For starters, anything this cute should be illegal. Secondly, I guarantee that it's going to part fans from their money like no-one's business this Holiday season.\nThe new Lego set in question? How to Train Your Dragon: Toothless. With an exaggerated cartoon design that makes the dragon even more adorable than normal (he's got a much bigger head with massive eyes and iddy biddy legs), this kit is in danger territory for any fans of the animated or live-action films.\nLego How to Train Your Dragon: Toothless | $69.99 at Lego\nThis kit is made up of just under 800 pieces, features a fish snack and plasma blast accessories, and stands at 7in (16cm) tall. It's available for pre-order now and will arrive by July 8. Thanks to that 18+ age-rating, it's also designed as a display piece rather than a toy.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You adore How to Train Your Dragon\n\u2705 You're buying it as a gift for fans\n\u2705 You want a simple, straightforward project\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You're buying for kids who want a playset\nPrice check:\n\ud83d\udcb2 None (exclusive to Lego Store)\nUK price:\n\u2b50 \u00a359.99 at Lego\nAU price:\n\u2b50 AU$109.99 at Lego\nBecause it's just seven inches tall and is made up of 784 pieces, Lego Toothless is ideal for newcomers and veterans alike. It doesn't matter if you're new to the best Lego sets or haven't made a model in years; this one won't take too long to construct (probably a single evening) and isn't overly complicated. That small stature means it isn't going to completely take over the space it's in, either. This is a tasteful addition to a setup, not an in-your-face centerpiece.\nPersonally, my favorite feature is the movable head and fish accessory for the dragon to chow down on. Even though it sounds simple, being able to pose the head and mouth however you like adds a lot of personality to the model \u2013 something I praised in my Lego Piranha Plant review, because that kit takes a similar approach. Plus, him clutching the fish snack in his jaws only adds to the set's already puppy-like pose. Honestly, it's enough to melt your heart.\nLego How to Train Your Dragon: Toothless is available to pre-order exclusively via the Lego Store, and it'll arrive July 8. If you sign in to Lego's free Insider program (it's basically a reward for having a login) before purchasing, you can also start earning points at the same time.\n- Amazon Lego deals: Save up to $28\n- Walmart Lego deals: Get up to $35 off\n- Best Buy Lego deals: Up to $25 off\n- Lego Store deals: Save up to 40%\nLooking to build up your collection for less?

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nWant a cool display piece from the Harry Potter range that won't bankrupt you or require a room of its own to display? The Lego Talking Sorting Hat wins ten points for Gryffindor. The fact that it yells out quotes from the movie is a unique selling point too, so it isn't just for show.\nPros\n- +\nA literal conversation starter\n- +\nWon't take up loads of space on display\n- +\nHandsome Hogwarts House stand to show it off on\nCons\n- -\nSadly not full-size\n- -\nSome stickers are used\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nThe Lego Talking Sorting Hat is a conversation starter \u2013 and I mean that literally. As its name would suggest, this set is the talkative sort.\nIf you're a millennial like me who grew up working out which Hogwarts House we'd belong to, this stuff is goddamn catnip. Using sound-bites from the first Harry Potter movie, it'll 'sort' you into Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, or Hufflepuff at the push of a button. That makes the Lego Talking Sorting Hat an absolute delight if you have friends round.\nEven as a mute model, it'd be cool. But as one that actually yaps away when interacted with? It becomes an instant contender for the best Lego sets.\nFeatures\nPrice | $99.99/\u00a389.99 |\nAges | 18+ |\nPieces | 561 |\nMinifigures | 1 |\nBuild time | 1 - 2hrs |\nDimensions | H: 7in (18cm) / W: 10.5in (27cm) / D: 11in (28 cm) |\nItem Number | 76291 |\n- Actually talks\n- 561 pieces\n- Comes with stand and minifig Harry\nThis kit is pure magic, so let's get the bad news out of the way first: it isn't to-scale. Rather than being a full-size version of the hat, this is only 9.5in (24cm) tall and 561 pieces strong.\nIt's all on the up-and-up from there, though. Lego Talking Sorting Hat features a pressable top that you can push down like a lever, causing it to cycle through a random series of quotes which end with the kit bellowing the Hogwarts House you belong in.\nIt comes on a sleek black and gold stand as well, so won't just be laying about. This features the icons of Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw, along with a minifigure of Harry himself wearing the Sorting Hat.\nBuild\n- Takes roughly 1-2hrs\n- An easy-going build\n- A couple of prominent stickers\nAs a smaller build with just over 500 pieces, the Lego Talking Sorting Hat isn't going to take you long to finish. Indeed, I smashed through it in about an hour \u2013 it would take two at most.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nIt'll be a pleasant experience. The project isn't particularly taxing, and despite a few tricky moments where you may accidentally drop a piece inside the half-built model (which leads to you rattling it upside down like a salt shaker), it's easygoing on the whole. There are only a couple of stickers too, which are prominent \u2013 and thus anxiety-inducing \u2013 but satisfying when placed correctly.\nDesign\n- Expressive, despite not being 1-to-1\n- Doesn't take up much space on display\n- Some stickers, but not many\nLego can verge into the uncanny valley with its larger character models (such as Chewbacca), and that's why droids, helmets, or objects like the Talking Sorting Hat work so well when turned into bricks. This kit may have doorstop eyes and a big hole for a mouth, but it's surprisingly expressive nonetheless. That mouth moves when the lever is pushed, for example.\nEven though the kit can't capture its inspiration's exact look due to the many folds and curves, it also does a great job selling you on this being the Sorting Hat despite any differences. Take one glance at that face and I suspect you'll know exactly what it's supposed to be. That's impressive.\nThe stand is classy too with its mix of black, gold, and printed house banners. I'm particularly fond of the mini Harry wearing an even smaller Sorting Hat, because it perfectly captures that moment from the film and provides a quick hit of nostalgia. Speaking of which, a hidden Sword of Gryffindor is a nice touch\u2026\nThere's some clever planning here as well. Aside from technical pieces that let some of its pieces move, there's an easily accessible compartment that lets you get at the battery without any fuss.\nIs it disappointing that the set used stickers rather than printed-on pieces in some cases? Yes. And when they're as prominent as they are here, applying them can be tense. However, they're mercifully few in number and look pretty great when added; they provide some much-needed wear and tear via patches.\nShould you buy the Lego Talking Sorting Hat?\nIf you're looking for a Harry Potter set you can have on display without taking up masses of space and one that serves as a (literal) conversation starter for your guests, the Lego Talking Sorting Hat is worth its weight in gold Galleons. It's perfect as a gift too, not to mention a relaxing project for grown-ups who don't want taxing builds.\nThe model not being full-size might disappoint some, and it isn't a playset so won't appeal much to kids (who are better off with the many classroom kits). However, it'll delight the intended adult audience\u2026 all without breaking the bank.\nRatings\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nBuild experience | It's not a particularly complicated set aside from a couple of fiddly bits, nor one that'll take you ages to build, so construction is a pleasant time. | 4/5 |\nAccessibility | Although the majority of this build is straightforward, it's not all plain sailing as you work on the inner mechanisms. | 3.5/5 |\nInstruction quality | Clearly visible red lines surround the pieces you need to put down, so you shouldn't get confused with what comes next. | 4/5 |\nExtra features | There aren't any hidden Easter eggs or references, but hey - this set can actually talk. | 5/5 |\nBuy it if...\n\u2705 You want a fun but relaxing build for adults\nThis will take an evening at most and is an enjoyable project from start to finish.\n\u2705 You want more than a model\nThanks to its ability to speak, this set is an absolute delight if you have guests popping over. It doesn't take up much room on display either, which is a bonus.\nDon't buy it if...\n\u274c You're expecting it to be full-size\nSadly, this is a miniature version of the hat. Sorry folks.\n\u274c You want a playset\nBuying for kids? This isn't the one. It's designed with adults in mind as a display piece.\nHow I tested the Lego Talking Sorting Hat\nThis review sample was provided by the publisher.\nI spent a few hours casually putting this set together while doing other tasks at the same time. And yes, I was humming the Harry Potter theme tune for most of that time.\nFor more on our process, don't miss this guide to how we test Lego.

But for me, the Talking Sorting Hat might be my favorite Wizarding World kit... and it's never been cheaper than it is now. More specifically, it's $79.95 at Amazon right now rather than $100. Meanwhile, UK readers can grab it for \u00a369.99 at Very instead of \u00a390.\nEven though it won't dominate a room like the full Hogwarts Castle kit (be it the old microfigure one, the smaller 18+ display piece, or the new modular version made up of numerous sets), the Sorting Hat is a first-class conversation starter. And I mean that literally; besides looking awesome, it can be pressed to speak. That's part of the reason it found itself on our list of the best Lego sets.\nLego Harry Potter Talking Sorting Hat | $99.99 $79.95 at Amazon\nSave $20 - This kit has literally never been cheaper than it is now, breaking a record and outdoing the average of around $83 we've seen for the past several months.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You want a fun, interactive display piece\n\u2705 You're looking for a conversation starter\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You're expecting it to be full size\nPrice check:\n\ud83d\udcb2 Walmart | $79.95\nUK price:\n\u00a389.99 \u00a369.99 at Very\nAs I pointed out in my Lego Talking Sorting Hat (76291) review, there's something magical about this set - and although I apologize for the dad joke, it's true. With lines taken straight from the first movie, the Lego Sorting Hat will yell out which Hogwarts House it thinks you should be in at a press of the button. Its mouth will also move when you activate it, helping bring the set to life.\nThe ability to chatter isn't a common feature for Lego, and it's a struggle to think of many kits that do the same thing (the best examples I can come up with are the Mario, Peach, and Luigi figures). It's a great novelty that'll get everyone talking, particularly because guests are likely to think it's 'just' a model.\nIs it a shame that certain pieces use stickers to represent wear and tear rather than printed blocks? Sure. That's always a bummer when it comes to Lego, because it's fiddly and you're stuffed if you have unsteady hands. But that doesn't dampen the fun of it on the whole, and they're thankfully few in number.\nSimilarly, the fact it's not full size is a bit disappointing but isn't a deal-breaker. The Sorting Hat being smaller makes it easier to show off, unlike so many premium Lego. The fact it comes with a classy black stand featuring each Hogwarts house crest and minfig Harry wearing a teeny Sorting Hat adds to this, giving it a more sophisticated look than it may otherwise have.\nEssentially, I'd recommend this kit if you want a Lego Harry Potter model that won't break the bank or need a full Room of Requirement to set up in. It's also ideal as a gift for fans of the Wizarding World, so take note if you're hunting down last-minute presents.\nLooking for discounts on bricks?

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThis is a truly magnificent set marred only by a few disappointing stickers. Its unique build is a bafflingly brilliant example of the company's out-of-the-brick engineering, and the exterior of Lego Gringotts Bank itself is one of the finest-looking modular buildings to date. The price point is a big ask for those looking to simply sandwich the modular between its Diagon Alley neighbours, but judge this monster build as a standalone Harry Potter Collector\u2019s Edition megalith and it\u2019s right up there with the Wizarding World\u2019s greatest Lego sets. This magical modular has whetted our appetite for a big ol\u2019 Hogsmeade set. (Please, Lego?)\nPros\n- +\nYou won't find another Lego set like it\n- +\nOne of the coolest-looking 'modulars' ever\n- +\nSurprisingly sturdy when attached\n- +\nWe love the dragon\n- +\nChocked full of details from the movies\n- +\nThe mine-cart track is really neat\n- +\nThe Grand Hall really does look grand\n- +\nNice selection of minifigures\nCons\n- -\nThat entrance sticker\n- -\nDisappointing exterior window stickers\n- -\nWe would have liked to have seen the larger, second dome on the roof\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nTo call the Lego Gringotts Bank (76417) one of the most anticipated additions to Billund\u2019s brick-built wizarding world is an understatement. At the end of 2020, the Lego Diagon Alley (75978) kit was released to critical acclaim and remains one of the best Lego sets available on the market right now. But one building in particular was suspiciously absent - Gringotts itself.\nIt took a couple of years for fans to finally get the announcement they\u2019d been waiting for... but not necessarily the one they expected. Instead of a simple modular addition that would sandwich itself between the existing Diagon Alley buildings, the new Lego Gringotts Bank was a near 5,000-piece behemoth. And the magical bank was only the half of it - literally. Below the fa\u00e7ade sits its impenetrable underground vaults, and a mine cart to boot.\nEven though Lego made it clear that the bank could be parted from this imposing underground section and still serve as a modular building, the reception was mixed. Some brick builders thought it looked incredible, while others questioned why they had to purchase a set with an MSRP of $429.99 / \u00a3369.99 just to get the modular building they\u2019d been waiting for. And yet, we deny any Lego Harry Potter fan who wasn\u2019t at the very least intrigued. Because one thing\u2019s for sure - there\u2019s never been a Lego set quite like the Lego Harry Potter Gringotts Wizarding Bank.\nSo, we\u2019ve brought our key (and our wand) to find out what's lurking in this magical set\u2019s vaults\u2026\nLego Gringotts - features\n| Price | $429.99 / \u00a3369.99 |\n| Ages | 18+ |\n| Pieces | 4,801 |\n| Minifigures | 13 |\n| Height | 30\" (75cm) |\n| Width | 13\" (32cm) |\n| Depth | 10\" (25cm) |\n| Item Number | 76417 |\nThe Lego Harry Potter Gringotts Wizarding Bank towers at a jaw-dropping 75cm, making it one of the tallest Lego sets ever produced. It\u2019s also one of the largest, comprising a humongous 4,801 pieces. When it comes to Lego Harry Potter, only Hogwarts Castle (6,020 pieces), Diagon Alley (5,544 pieces), and Hogwarts Express (5,129 pieces) contain more bricks.\nAlongside Gringotts Bank, the underground vaults, and the Ukrainian Ironbelly, this set comes with three gold galleon coins. These exclusive items are a bit of an Easter egg and can be paired with the Hogwarts Icons (76391) set (MSRP $299.99 / \u00a3259.99).\nAll this has been a long time coming. Go back to 2011 and Lego\u2019s dated but still excellent first stab at Diagon Alley (10217) featured only three buildings, and the centerpiece was Gringotts' magnificent marble-clad bank - but it absolutely pales in comparison to this much more ambitious (not to mention screen-accurate) kit.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nLego Gringotts Bank \u2013 how easy is it to build?\n- 4,801 pieces\n- Mostly simple building techniques\n- The Ukrainian Ironbelly dragon is a really fun build\nThis mammoth project is spread across four instruction booklets and comprises 31 bagged sections and three separate builds: the Gringotts vaults, the Ukrainian Ironbelly dragon, and the bank itself. Booklet one is dedicated to one of two sections that make up the vaults, while booklet two tackles the second section and finishes with the dragon. Booklets three and four are dedicated to the Bank itself.\nUnsurprisingly, the vaults feature a good portion of solid, structural building, but bits of landscaping and the neat little vaults themselves provide plenty of interesting respite. The two sections slide into each other to create a rigid cross shape that\u2019s secured by two 11-hole Technic Beams. Once you\u2019ve added the vaults, you then build the mine cart and lay the tracks, which is a lot of fun.\nDespite the apparent complexity of this cavernous base, it\u2019s impressively simple and features fewer Technic pieces than you might expect.\nThe dragon is a little more fiddly, but it's a simply delightful build that takes a while to complete thanks to the abundance of tiny pieces, providing both detail and ample articulation to form a variety of poses.\nIt\u2019s nice that Lego chose to save the main course \u2013 and most involved build \u2013 until last, Gringotts Bank itself. As is often the case with Lego modular buildings, what earns them their 18+ rating isn\u2019t so much the difficulty, but the tedium of adding row after row after row of 1 x 1 pieces or thin strips to make up walls.\nIf you\u2019ve built a \u2018modular\u2019 before, it\u2019s relatively standard fare. You begin by laying down tens of titles before gradually building up the walls and moving up through each floor respectively. Placing tile after tile onto SNOT bricks to build up that marble veneer sure is tedious, but it\u2019s also hugely rewarding because the results are quite simply jaw dropping.\nThere are a couple of clever building techniques that are worth highlighting too. The first being the use of 1 x 1 tiles with clips and 1 x 1 round plates with bar handles to create the tilting pillars on the building\u2019s frontage. And the second is a few skewed windows, ingeniously implemented by attaching each via a Technic pin, so they lean accordingly.\nI'm less positive about another feature that fans will also groan at, though. This set doesn\u2019t boast Lego\u2019s most generous number of printed pieces, but stickers were always going to feature heavily regardless. All told, you have to stick down 50 of the things, and when you\u2019re working on a set that\u2019s this expensive, getting the \u201cGringotts Bank\u201d stickers correct above the entrance is a bit of a heart-in-your-mouth moment. However, one of the sticker sheets is on a metallic film, used to represent the magical-looking windows in the Grand Hall, which is a nice addition.\nAll told, the build took me a whopping 12 hours and 40 minutes to complete, at a relatively brisk pace, too. The three separate builds and multiple instruction booklets make it a great set to put together with friends. And even though large Lego sets are always fragile up to a point, and interlocking the two criss-cross vault sections certainly justifies the 18+ rating, the time is largely spent simply laying down Lego bricks and watching the build come together. It's a lot of fun. Younger builders will certainly have fun playing with the minifigures and dipping in and out of a project that involves plenty of simple sections, with adult supervision of course.\nLego Gringotts \u2013 design\n- A jaw-dropping Lego set\n- Two very disappointing stickers\n- Stunning interior considering the available space\nThe burning question from Lego fans all over the Wizarding World since this precarious-looking set\u2019s announcement has been: how robust is it? Well, 'surprisingly robust' is the answer. This isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to display in a busy thoroughfare, but I\u2019ve done a few wobble tests \u2013 especially during the photoshoot \u2013 and I never felt like it was going to topple or break apart under its own weight. The danger zone comes when the two sections are attached/detached.\nAlright, so picking up a modular building is never easy. Bendy baseplates can quickly separate from foundations, and it doesn\u2019t take much force to break apart a wall. Having to line up a hulking modular, while pressing it down to secure it in place or lifting it off, only to jolt from the sudden separation of pieces, sounds terrifying. Thankfully, the underground vaults\u2019 ingenious cross-shaped design affords you the room to place and remove the modular while keeping your hands firmly beneath the baseplate at all times.\nRemarkably, nothing but gravity is holding the underground vaults and the bank together when they\u2019re attached. The modular simply sits atop the vaults, with four 2 x 2 x 1 corner pieces preventing the baseplate from sliding off. This isn\u2019t surprising as you can't attach studs to the underside of a baseplate. A multi-plate base, fixed onto the vaults via Technic pieces or studs, could have arguably proven more dangerous.\nIn short, there\u2019s safety in the fluidity of motion when moving the building on and off its cavernous plinth.\nSeparated or connected, the entire playset truly is a sight to behold. Starting from the bottom, the mine-cart tracks are a neat playability feature and the drab vaults are much more detailed and interesting than photographs convey. Round the back is a stream of transparent, blue bricks used to create the Thief\u2019s Downfall, a waterfall used to wash away the enchantments of any nefarious visitors.\nThree of the four vaults open to reveal surprises: 687 holds Harry\u2019s family fortune, 713 holds the Philosopher's Stone, and the Lestrange vault features a single goblet that, when pushed, rains goblets to simulate the Gemino Curse. There\u2019s also an area with a chain and a feeding schedule scrawled onto a rock, so you can recreate the dragon\u2019s breakout scene from the final film in the series.\nAnd the details don\u2019t stop there. Stalactites and stalagmites adorn the cavern\u2019s roof and base respectively, while lanterns hang off the vaults and tiny green bricks represent pockets of algae and mosses. To summarize, it's a well thought-out design.\nThat extends beyond how it looks, by the way. Two working signals can be used to control the mine cart, so it stops immediately outside of 687 or 713 or continues right down to Bellatrix\u2019s vault.\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian Ironbelly is a delightful sidebuild that pieces together much like the Lego Hungarian Horntail Dragon (MSRP $49.99 / \u00a344.99), with an exclusive, printed headpiece. Like the Horntail, the articulated wings are a joy to put together and the cloth that represents the flaps of skin is slightly stretchy and virtually impossible to crease. Its feet also feature two 1 x 1 tiles with clips so it can be attached to the bank\u2019s dome. Pair this with the fire piece that attaches to its mouth and you can recreate its position atop the Gringotts Bank from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando Resort.\nMoving up to the bank itself, the four-storey frontage is about as close to the prototype as you can imagine at this scale. Stack it up against an image of the aforementioned Gringotts Bank from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and the proportions and angles are near-perfect. The skewed pillars are a highlight. They're created by mounting pillar pieces onto 1 x 1 tiles with clips and then cleverly locking them in place by constructing a cornice around them.\nThe SNOT-brick construction to create the beautiful marble walls is another highlight, and will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s a fan of Lego\u2019s modular buildings or the fantastic Sanctum Sanctorum (76218) in particular (MSRP $249.99 / \u00a3214.99).\nSure, we\u2019re not convinced by the few slivers of grey bricks \u2013 likely included to add a little weathering \u2013 and it\u2019s a shame the designers weren't able to replicate the marble cornice at the bottom of the two balconies. But we\u2019re splitting bricks here, because the overall design really is that good.\nWhat\u2019s not good is the two stickers used to represent the engraving above the front entrance. This is the focal point of the entire build and by splitting the name into two stickers: \u201cGRINGOT\u201d and \u201cTS BANK,\u201d you\u2019re left with what appears to be three, awkward words. Lego has stretched a single sticker across multiple pieces before, so we can't fathom why one long sticker wasn't used here. Ideally, it would have been printed but even then it would have been difficult to position the characters close enough together at the join to create a seamless word. But in a set this expensive, this innovative and this jaw-dropping, it's a real shame that this wasn\u2019t remedied.\nAnother sticker-related problem is the side windows. We reckon physical frames like those on the front of the bank would have looked much better, serving as a tantalizing glimpse into the interior. But Lego\u2019s decision to go with stickers isn\u2019t the main problem, it\u2019s the fact that these stickers are placed on transparent, frameless panes (they should have been black). What you end up with is a sticker surrounded by a thin, see-through border, which can look very untidy in the wrong light. If you plan on lighting the interior of your Gringotts, we\u2019d recommend leaving off the stickers altogether, since the flat panes will look much better than light bleeding through the gaps between the stickers.\nStill, replicating Gringotts\u2019 sprawling Grand Banking Hall in Lego was always going to be a challenge and I think the designers have done a great job with the available space. I'm impressed that they managed to fit in five banking desks on the ground floor, as well as the centerpiece chandelier, but it\u2019s not bursting with Easter eggs and details just for the sake of it. And that\u2019s a good thing. Keeping the interior relatively clean and not at all cluttered adds to the sense of space and grandeur. The decision to make the second floor a mezzanine was a neat choice, too, meaning you get a little extra interior detail, while creating the illusion of a towering ceiling.\nMove to the building\u2019s roof and you'll find that the dome lifts off to reveal a tiny, doorless room. It lifts off a little too easy for my tastes, due to the perched dragon, but it\u2019s yet to fall off. The rest of the roof isn't attached and slides off to gain better access to the interior. Stickers aside, the roof is perhaps the only disappointing aspect of this fine modular building\u2019s design. In the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the front dome is a secondary dome to the larger one that serves as a window light to the Grand Banking Hall.\nThis is the dome that the dragon bursts through and it\u2019s represented here, only by a few clear windscreen-type pieces. We like how one is missing, with a few scattered transparent pieces used to represent shards of glass, but in a model that\u2019s this ambitious, we can\u2019t imagine a secondary dome was beyond the capabilities of this set\u2019s talented design team, and it would have been the icing on the cake.\nNot that there aren't some extra flourishes. The modular building is flanked via an attractive side wall, complete with a side entrance into the Grand Banking Hall, and a miniature building and side alley. Both of these inclusions should allow the set to butt against adjacent buildings in seamless fashion. The side building is the Magical Managerie, which is a real building from Diagon Alley, although it would appear some artistic licence has been used in its creation. It\u2019s also worth noting that the building left of Gringotts Bank at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter features a similar miniature tower and spire.\nFinally, the cobbled street in front of the bank looks fantastic. It\u2019s a simple mix of rounded plates, which work beautifully together to create a convincing cobbled effect.\nLet's cap off by visiting the 13-strong roster of minifigures. It's a respectable haul. For comparison, Diagon Alley retails for slightly more and contains just one additional minifigure, while the Hogwarts Express (MSRP $499.99 / \u00a3429.99) admittedly contains 20.\nThe minifigures represent two different films: The Philosopher's Stone and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The former is Rubeus Hagrid and a young Harry Potter, with the latter comprising an older Harry Potter, Dragomir Despard, Bellatrix Lestrange, Griphook, Bogrod, Ricbert, a Death Eater, and two guards. The Ravenclaw scholars among you may point out that Griphook was also in The Philosopher's Stone, but he\u2019s in Deathly Hallows garb. You also get two generic goblins that will suit mock-ups of either film.\nDragomir and Bellatrix are each two characters in one. Spin their heads around to reveal the faces of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively, with suitable hair pieces also included to complete the Polyjuice transformation.\nIn essence, the minifigures look good. You don\u2019t tend to get the same level of arm, hip, and foot printing that\u2019s prevalent on many Star Wars minifigures when it comes to Lego Harry Potter, but outfits do tend to be simpler. Griphook and the two generic goblins are the only examples that feature arm printing, but every figure apart from Hagrid and the two guards have alternate faces.\nBellatrix is my favourite. She features exquisite printing all over her dress \u2013 front and back \u2013 as well as an instantly recognisable hair piece and a fantastic, characteristically evil/snooty expression.\nShould you buy the Lego Harry Potter Gringotts Wizarding Bank?\nHonestly, I\u2019d rather spend a night in Azkaban than score the Lego Harry Potter Gringotts Wizarding Bank. Giving a set this innovative, this lovingly designed, and this jaw-dropping anything less than a perfect five stars just doesn\u2019t feel right. Especially when it's the stickers that are the biggest letdown.\nBut this is a holy grail playset. It\u2019s the fourth largest and fourth most expensive Lego Harry Potter build of all time. And darn it, I just can\u2019t let go of the split entrance engraving: \u201cGRINGOT TS BANK\u201d. Add to that the untidy window stickers and the lack of a rear dome for the dragon to burst through and I can\u2019t quite conjure that extra half star, but it's close.\nIf you\u2019re a Lego Harry Potter fan who\u2019s been saving up your galleons to pick up this set, it\u2019s a no-brainer. On the whole it\u2019s a stunning modular building \u2013 maybe even one of Lego\u2019s best. I was won over by the surprising level of detail in the underground vaults, and if you can look past those pesky stickers, the modular\u2019s frontage is a nearly perfect representation of the magical bank.\nThe marble architecture has been expertly executed, every inch of the interior has been put to good use, and the Magical Managerie is a fun little side build to latch onto other modulars. And on top of all that, you\u2019ve got one of the coolest dragons Lego has ever built. You just won't find another Lego set like it.\nYou do have to feel for anyone shelling out extra for the underground vaults when all they want to do is implement the modular into Diagon Alley, but despite my initial reservations when this set was announced, it works so well. I wouldn't be surprised if some forgo that long-anticipated Diagon diorama in favour of displaying this magical set how the designers intended.\n4.5 points to Gryffindor \u2013 ahem \u2013 Lego!\nBuy it if...\nYou're a thirty-something millennial\nIf you\u2019ve taken the Pottermore Sorting Hat Quiz so many times you\u2019re now unsure whether you\u2019re Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, can remember queuing outside of a Waterstones at midnight before heading home to read the Order of the Phoenix in one sitting and are still, secretly awaiting your Hogwarts acceptance letter, then I\u2019d suggest taking the Floo Network to your nearest Lego store.\nYou own the Lego Diagon Alley kit\nMuch has been said about the redundant underground vaults for anyone wanting to attach the bank to the modular Diagon Alley, but I reckon a clever set of shelves could sort that problem with the various shops and Gringotts Bank on one shelf and the vaults beneath. Regardless, this will definitely prove the centerpiece of your Diagon Alley diorama.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou can't justify the gold galleons\nThere\u2019s no doubt about it, this is an expensive set. And if you\u2019re not willing to pick this one up at the expense of other Harry Potter builds, fear not. Diagon Alley: Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes (76422) (MSRP $89.99 / \u00a384.99) looks to be the start of a range of smaller Diagon Alley builds, so I'm already crossing my wands for a smaller, more affordable Gringotts in the years to come.\nYou're not into modular buildings\nEven if you\u2019re not a Harry Potter fan, this is an excellent modular building in its own right. But if modulars simply aren\u2019t your thing then you\u2019re unlikely to enjoy building and displaying this set. Perhaps the Lego UCS X-Wing is more your thing?\nHow we tested the Lego Harry Potter Gringotts Wizarding Bank\nOur reviewer \u2013 a Hogwarts alumnus \u2013 swears he put this entire set together in one sitting after it was sent to us by Lego. However, we suspect the involvement of reparo.\nMost muggles will construct this set across multiple sittings, and the modular nature and four instructions booklets make it an ideal set to build with a friend or two.\nFor more information on our procedure, take a look at how we test products.\nFor more brick-based goodness, don't miss our guides to the best Lego Star Wars sets.

No matter whether you're seeking out weapons of water warfare for your kids or Super Soakers to blast your friends with over summer break, you'll find something to suit you here. The GamesRadar+ team and I have rounded up some suggestions here to help you find the right water pistols for you, saving precious time that could be spent in the backyard.\nThese recommendations span a range of price points and age-ranges, so there should be Super Soakers and water pistols listed below to fit any need. Want an affordable all-rounder that doesn't complicate things with bells and whistles? Try the Hydro Frenzy, our top choice. Hoping to find something a little more advanced, on the other hand? Look no further than SpyraThree. This premium option is one of the best water guns ever made, and it's tricked out enough to make other blasters look ridiculous.\nThis guide is going to keep being updated as the season progresses, too. Plenty more water pistols and Super Soakers are on the way, like the Power Drench that pulls water straight from a hose connector for pressurized shooting. Similarly, I'm testing the SpyraGravity right now \u2013 a water bomb-throwing blaster that does something we've never really seen before from the best water guns. Basically? It's time to let loose the hounds of (water) war!\nBenjamin has written about water guns, Super Soakers, and toys for years. He also spent a significant chunk of his childhood dedicated to destroying the foe (AKA his friends) with a water pistol in hand. He's currently reviewing the SpyraGravity water bomb thrower, alongside the entry-level SpyraGo.\nQuick list\nBest all-rounder\nKeen to cut loose? You can't do much better than this when it comes to water guns. The Hydro Frenzy fires two streams in random directions, so there's no escaping its wrath.\nRead more\nBest for siblings\nBuying for multiple children, but hoping not to spend too much? This is a great option in terms of value for money, and it impresses thanks to an ingenious reload system.\nRead more\nBest for adults\nWhy limit yourself to water pistols when you can get a blaster that also fires Nerf darts?

Take note of this water gun. Although you can fire it in 'normal' mode, remove the barrel to reveal a secondary fuction \u2013 two flexible tubes. The pressure from firing causes these to twist in every direction, and that sends streams of H20 all over the place. It's brilliantly chaotic, utterly random, and impossible to dodge.\nThe Hydro Frenzy isn't just about mayhem, nor is it a bog-standard water pistol \u2013 this is a three-in-one blaster with a couple of very different settings. You can lock the barrel's two tubes in place for a traditional jet of water, or pull the nozzle back to let them loose. Do so and they'll dance all over the place when you fire, shooting at random in practically every direction. Adjust the nozzle again for an even wider blast radius.\nIn terms of looks, this Super Soaker is pretty classic; it's an in-your-face blend of white, orange, and green, with a sizeable but rounded tank at the back. There are no fancy stocks or triggers here.\nI'll admit, I wasn't expecting great things when I first broke it out of the box... but closer inspection revealed how wrong I was. For starters, yes \u2013 freeing the two tubes and firing results in a delightfully mad shower of H20 that made me want to cackle. It's one heck of a trump card in backyard battles, because there's next to no way of avoiding it.\nHowever, there's more to it besides the mode listed above. Sliding the barrel forwards secures those tubes and allows you to fire 'normally.' The latter catapults two jets of water straight ahead, and besides being quite accurate, their range is surprisingly good. In essence, this is a great multi-purpose option.\n- Read more: Super Soaker Hydro Frenzy review\nBest water guns for siblings\n2. Super Soaker Dunk-Fill 2-Pack\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe problem with most water pistols is that there's usually only one, and they're often quite expensive. This isn't much good if you have multiple kids, because 'one' doesn't exactly divide very well and stocking up on more can get expensive quickly. That's what's so appealing about these Super Soakers; they come as a pair.\nThey also fix one of my biggest gripes with the best water guns - the faff of having to wait while your blaster refills slowly from the tap, bucket, or hose. That's precious time which could be spent drenching everyone else, and I'm sure we could agree that's just not cricket. However, the Dunk-Fill sidesteps all that by... well, doing what it says on the tin. You simply dunk the things and off you go.\nOK, it's not quite as simple as that. You actually have to make sure they're dunked upright, and you'll need a bucket or something similar so the tank is totally submerged. But so long as you follow that simple rule, it works like magic. No, seriously \u2013 it packs an ingenious little door in the canister's bottom that opens when you thrust it into a body of water, loading the blaster in seconds. It then shuts when you lift the blaster up, so none of your precious cargo escapes.\nMost importantly, the Dunk-Fill 2-Pack is lots of fun to use as well. It's a good old-fashioned pump-action water gun so is really easy to get the hang of regardless of age, and it doesn't require much strength to activate either. While it isn't going to match other entries on this list at a distance, it'll do the job nicely at short to mid-range. The inclusion of a second blaster makes it ideal for siblings too, so you shouldn't have issues with arguments over who gets what here.\nBest water guns for adults\n3. SpyraThree\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere are water guns, and then there's the SpyraThree. This is the most impressive water pistol I've ever seen, hands down \u2013 and it's not even close.\nDesigned with a \"what if we made Super Soakers for grown-ups\" mentality, it's a weapon of mass water destruction that is unbelievably accurate, fast-firing, and fun to use. It fills up quickly thanks to a clever retrieval system that's as easy as pushing a button, too, so you'll dominate the game if you bring this to a water fight.\nThe SpyraThree gets all sci-fi up in the water gun industry, and it almost looks like something you'd find on the set of an Alien movie (if it weren't for the bright blue or red coloring). That extends to a digital display showing how much ammo you have left.\nAlongside this fancy tech is an auto-refill feature where you dunk the end of the blaster into water and hit a button, multiple fire modes (single-shot League, Burst, and the spray-n-pray Open), and fast USB-C charging. This does make the SpyraThree kinda weighty, but not to the point it's uncomfortable. Speaking of which, a textured rubber grip helps in that regard.\nTime for a little honesty \u2013 I was sceptical about the SpyraThree before my review sample arrived. I had my doubts that it could outperform high-end Super Soakers despite the marketing fluff, and it was pricey enough to make me wince. Then I pulled the trigger. Oh boy, was I wrong.\nThis is the Mona Lisa of water guns; it's a marvel. The accuracy and speed of each shot left me speechless, while the fancy tactical display (not to mention the premium build material) makes it feel every cent of its price. I was able to knock down targets across my garden practically every time, all while being able to tell how many shots I had left in the tank without having to guess. When combined with the drastically different fire modes, this is the complete package.\nReloading is a breeze too, though you will need a larger bucket of water to refill the SpyraThree properly.\nBest water guns - short range\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThis isn't your average water gun; it's precision-engineered to cause delightful carnage on the battlefield. Rather than shooting a single stream, the blaster fires a double-helix of H20 to drench anyone in front of you no matter how much they try and dodge.\nIt's all down to a spinning cylinder at the end of the barrel. Using the gun's pump will cause that cylinder to whirl, sending out twin jets of water that are almost guaranteed to hit something. That makes the Twister perfect for folks who charge headlong into action - it's capable of blasting multiple people at once.\nAlthough it requires force to activate properly (meaning very young warriors should look elsewhere), this is balanced out by not needing to aim. We're a terrible shot so ended up being grateful for that during our hands-on tests.\n- Read more: Nerf Super Soaker Twister review\nBest water guns - capacity\n5. Super Soaker Hydra\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're keen to avoid refilling your blaster every few minutes, this particular Super Soaker is one of the best water guns there is. It offers a ridiculously large capacity of 65 fluid ounces (1.9 liters), so you're set for the long haul with this one.\nAlthough that makes the Hydra fairly heavy, it's still straightforward for kids to fire if they're strong enough to wield it fully loaded. That's due to an easy-fire mechanism. Rather than a pump system, air pressure, or brute force, it uses a handle that you just pull to unleash a watery deluge.\nAnd we mean deluge. This isn't a dribbling dollar-store pistol. The Hydra means business, and it's capable of utterly drenching your opponents.\nBest water guns - for young kids\n6. Super Soaker Fortnite HC-E\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're hoping to get the best water guns without splashing out both literally and figuratively, this Fortnite-themed Super Soaker is a fair place to start. While it isn't as powerful as other blasters, it's cheap and will do the job very nicely. It's a damn sight better than dollar-store equivalents, too.\nPlus, few water pistols look this cool. Based on Fortnite's Hand Cannon, it's a pitch-perfect recreation of the gun from the video game (albeit in family-friendly purple and orange). And even though it's prone to some leakage, the HC-E's low cost and awesome design make up for that.\nIt doesn't require pumping up either - just fill it, aim, and pull the trigger. That makes this one a great Super Soaker for children who want to get into the action as quickly as possible.\nBest water guns - FAQ\nWhat is the most powerful water gun?\nIf you're looking for the best water gun that balances price with power, the Super Soaker Hydra is a front-runner with few rivals. Thanks to a handle pump that unleashes a deluge of water, it'll completely drench opponents in no time at all. Although it'll get through its 65 fl oz (1.9L) tank faster than you'd expect, there aren't many alternatives within the same price range that can challenge it.\nMore premium options offer an even stronger performance. We've yet to go hands-on with it, but the SpyraTwo has been making waves in recent years (quite literally). Indeed, the company claims that it is the \"world's strongest water gun\". This is thanks to an electric pump that fires pellets of water rather than the usual stream.\nWhich water gun shoots the farthest?\nAfter a lot of research, we've discovered that the Stream Machine TL 750 might just have the longest range of all the water guns we've looked at - more specifically, it can fire \"up to 70 feet\", which is a whole lot more than the majority of the competition. Want a water gun that can shoot the farthest? Take a look at the Stream Machine.\nBy way of context, your average water pistol can shoot a distance of 5 to 40 feet. The vast majority tend to fall around the mid-30s, and the bare minimum range we'd recommend is 10 feet unless you're opting for power (as is the case with the Super Soaker Soakzooka) or sheer soaking capability.\nHow much does the most powerful water gun cost?\nIf you're looking to get your hands on the most powerful water gun to make your friends run for cover, you can expect to pay $20 / \u00a320 as a bare minimum for the privilege (a Super Soaker Hyrda costs roughly that amount, for example). However, top-of-the-line blasters can set you back a fair bit more so we'd expect prices to rise to the region of $30 / \u00a330 at most. Basically, the more powerful your water pistol is, the more expensive it's going to be.\nWell, we say 'at most'. There are super-advanced blasters that'll really knock your socks off like the SpyraTwo, but those will put a significant dent in your wallet of $100 / \u00a3100 or more.\nFor more offers everyone can enjoy, be sure to check out the top board games for kids and board games for families.
