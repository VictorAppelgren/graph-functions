  "description": "A major change in U.S. policy is forcing many organizations to rethink their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.",
  "content": "A major change in U.S. policy is forcing many organizations to rethink their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. In January this year, President Donald Trump signed that formally reversed federal DEI mandates. These orders directed agencies to dismantle internal DEI offices, eliminate DEI training programs, and withdraw equity-focused funding, calling such efforts \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and \u201cideologically driven.\u201d\n\nFor over a decade, DEI has influenced the way teams are built, people are supported, and communities are included in decision-making. It drove innovation, improved team performance, and helped people from overlooked backgrounds feel seen, heard, and included.\n\nTrump\u2019s new orders push back against DEI, replacing it with \u2018merit-based\u2019 hiring, raising concern about what\u2019s lost in the process. The shift left many teams unsure of how to move forward, especially those who\u2019ve built their culture around inclusion. Organizations are reassessing policies, directing legal and cultural shifts, and working to preserve inclusive values even as federal priorities move in a different direction.\n\nThe Executive Orders Behind the Disruption\n\nTrump's move to dismantle DEI efforts began with two executive orders signed within days of taking office, setting off immediate ripple effects across federal agencies and beyond. These orders marked an , affecting not just government operations but also private contractors who rely on government partnerships.\n\nExecutive Order 14151, titled \"Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\" directed the termination of what it calls \"discriminatory programs\" going by the name of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The order instructed agencies to shut down DEI offices, cancel equity-centered grants and contracts, and eliminate DEI performance requirements for employees, contractors, and grantees. Federal agencies were given broad mandates to dismantle these programs \"to the maximum extent allowed by law.\"\n\nExecutive Order 14173, \"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,\" took a different approach by revoking several prior orders focused on equal employment opportunity and workplace diversity. This order directed agency heads to submit reports by May 20, 2025, identifying \"the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners\" in their sectors and outlining specific steps to deter DEI programs that might constitute illegal discrimination.\n\nA third order, Executive Order 14281, signed in April, aimed to \"eliminate the use of disparate impact liability in all contexts to the maximum degree possible.\" This targets a legal theory that holds employers liable for policies that disproportionately affect protected groups, even without intentional discrimination.\n\nThe administration frames these changes as a return to \"merit-based\" hiring, arguing that identity-focused practices are discriminatory and unlawful. However, the orders don't define \"illegal DEI,\" creating uncertainty for organizations trying to understand what's permissible. This ambiguity has prompted many companies to scale back or completely eliminate their DEI programs, even as legal challenges to the orders work their way through the courts.\n\nThe effects of Trump's executive orders are moving beyond policy changes into measurable workplace outcomes. , of 965 U.S. companies with active DEI programs before November 2024, reveals the tangible consequences organizations are facing.\n\nThe numbers show immediate shifts in hiring and retention patterns. One in five companies has eliminated DEI initiatives entirely, with 74% citing the changed political climate as their primary reason. Among companies that cut programs, 57% report hiring fewer people from underrepresented groups. The decline is particularly pronounced for women of color (37% decrease), LGBTQIA+ candidates (33% decrease), and men of color (33% decrease). By comparison, only 12% reported decreased hiring of white men.\n\nThe workplace culture impacts are equally significant. Nearly half of the companies that reduced DEI efforts report declining employee morale, while 36% struggle with retention of diverse talent. Leadership representation has also shifted, with 30% noting fewer people of color in leadership roles and 24% reporting fewer women in leadership positions.\n\nPerhaps most concerning, 18% of organizations report increased incidents of workplace discrimination or bias following DEI program cuts. 25% acknowledge reputational damage, suggesting the changes extend beyond internal operations to external perceptions.\n\nThe survey reveals divided opinions among business leaders about these changes. Some view DEI elimination as removing divisive elements, with one respondent noting it \"restored a sense of fairness.\" Others express disappointment, with leaders describing the loss of \"safe spaces\" and being worried about being \"worse off as a company.\"\n\nThese patterns suggest the executive orders have created a ripple effect that extends across public agencies, private companies, nonprofits, and educational institutions. The changes are reshaping not just policies but fundamental aspects of how organizations attract talent, build leadership, and maintain workplace culture.\n\nHow the Changes are Impacting Organizations and Workplaces\n\nThe executive orders affect government agencies, federal contractors, private companies with federal funding, nonprofits, and educational institutions tied to federal grants. Even organizations without direct contracts are experiencing ripple effects as partners and industry peers adjust policies to comply.\n\nOrganizations that eliminated DEI programs report Employees who valued these initiatives feel abandoned, making them more likely to seek opportunities elsewhere. Recruitment has become more challenging, particularly with younger workers, while unclear communication about policy changes has damaged internal trust.\n\n, especially women, black professionals, and other underrepresented groups who prioritize inclusive workplaces. Hiring for these groups has slowed, and fewer younger candidates are applying. Internally, trust has weakened, opportunities feel less equitable, and problem-solving has suffered due to reduced diverse perspectives.\n\nWithout DEI initiatives, companies struggle to attract diverse talent. Skilled candidates who value inclusion often bypass employers that don't demonstrate clear commitment to equity, intensifying competition for talent in an already tight market.\n\nStepping away from DEI can damage both public perception and internal culture. Externally, organizations may appear out of touch, hurting brand image and stakeholder trust. Internally, the absence of DEI structures can allow bias or discrimination to go unchecked, weakening morale and creating unsafe work environments.\n\nSome companies, like have scaled back DEI programs amid political pressures. Others, including Costco, Apple, and Microsoft, maintain their inclusion commitments. Cutting DEI risks backlash from progressive employees, investors, and customers, while maintaining programs may provoke conservative opposition. Organizations must navigate these competing pressures, particularly as black consumers' buying power is projected to nearly double by 2030, underscoring the business case for inclusion.\n\nThe Trump administration's executive orders have created significant uncertainty for organizations across all sectors. Federal agencies are intensifying enforcement of civil rights laws, potentially creating legal risks for companies that maintain DEI programs. This has left businesses facing a difficult decision. Some are dismantling programs to avoid potential scrutiny, while others are maintaining their diversity commitments despite the political shift.\n\nOrganizations don't have to navigate these changes blindly. Clear, honest communication with employees and stakeholders helps maintain trust during this transition period. Companies should continue focusing on essential practices like fair hiring, equitable career development, and respectful workplace policies, regardless of what these efforts are called. Legal reviews of existing programs can help identify potential compliance issues while preserving inclusive practices.\n\nThe key is balancing political realities with organizational values and goals. Companies that stay committed to inclusion, even if they rebrand their approach, can continue attracting diverse talent and driving innovation. Those that abandon these efforts entirely risk losing valuable employees and damaging relationships with customers and stakeholders who value diversity.\n\nSuccess requires both flexibility and strategic thinking. Organizations that communicate transparently, review their policies carefully, and maintain inclusive cultures will be better positioned to weather this period of change while keeping the benefits of diverse, engaged teams.",

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. Longstanding Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. These civil-rights protections serve as a bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all Americans. As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans.\nYet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d (DEI) or \u201cdiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\u201d (DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation.\nIllegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex.\nThese illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American men, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities. Yet in case after tragic case, the American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\nThe Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work. I therefore order all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements. I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\nSec. 3. Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal Government. (a) The following executive actions are hereby revoked:\n(i) Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations);\n(ii) Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce);\n(iii) Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity); and\n(iv) The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce).\n(b) The Federal contracting process shall be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws. Accordingly:\n(i) Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), is hereby revoked. For 90 days from the date of this order, Federal contractors may continue to comply with the regulatory scheme in effect on January 20, 2025.\n(ii) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Department of Labor shall immediately cease:\n(A) Promoting \u201cdiversity\u201d;\n(B) Holding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking \u201caffirmative action\u201d; and\n(C) Allowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin.\n(iii) In accordance with Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), the employment, procurement, and contracting practices of Federal contractors and subcontractors shall not consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin in ways that violate the Nation\u2019s civil rights laws.\n(iv) The head of each agency shall include in every contract or grant award:\n(A) A term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government\u2019s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and\n(B) A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\n(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall:\n(i) Review and revise, as appropriate, all Government-wide processes, directives, and guidance;\n(ii) Excise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and\n(iii) Terminate all \u201cdiversity,\u201d \u201cequity,\u201d \u201cequitable decision-making,\u201d \u201cequitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,\u201d \u201cadvancing equity,\u201d and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate.\nSec. 4. Encouraging the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI Discrimination and Preferences. (a) The heads of all agencies, with the assistance of the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work identified in section 2 of this order.\n(b) To further inform and advise me so that my Administration may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policy, the Attorney General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI. The report shall contain a proposed strategic enforcement plan identifying:\n(i) Key sectors of concern within each agency\u2019s jurisdiction;\n(ii) The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern;\n(iii) A plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles (whether specifically denominated \u201cDEI\u201d or otherwise) that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences. As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars;\n(iv) Other strategies to encourage the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal civil-rights laws;\n(v) Litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest; and\n(vi) Potential regulatory action and sub-regulatory guidance.\nSec. 5. Other Actions. Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly issue guidance to all State and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds, as well as all institutions of higher education that receive Federal grants or participate in the Federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., regarding the measures and practices required to comply with Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023).\nSec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 7. Scope. (a) This order does not apply to lawful Federal or private-sector employment and contracting preferences for veterans of the U.S. armed forces or persons protected by the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.\n(b) This order does not prevent State or local governments, Federal contractors, or Federally-funded State and local educational agencies or institutions of higher education from engaging in First Amendment-protected speech.\n(c) This order does not prohibit persons teaching at a Federally funded institution of higher education as part of a larger course of academic instruction from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the unlawful employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order.\nSec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 21, 2025."

      "text": "Corporate DEI Under Fire: How Companies Are Responding to Trump's Executive Order\nThe landscape of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in corporate America is undergoing significant changes following recent executive actions by President Donald Trump.\nOn January 21, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order titled \"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,\" which seeks to eliminate DEI policies and programs across federal agencies and within private industries that do business with the federal government.\nThis directive has prompted varied responses from corporations, with some scaling back their DEI initiatives due to legal and political pressures, while others remain committed to fostering inclusive workplaces.\nHow Companies Are Responding to the Executive Order\nScaling Back DEI Programs\nTarget Corporation: Target announced on January 24, 2025, that it will end several of its DEI programs, including its Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) initiatives, citing an evolving external landscape. (Them, 2025)\nMeta Platforms, Inc.: Meta has also reduced its DEI initiatives, reflecting a broader trend among major corporations to reassess their diversity commitments in response to political and legal pressures. (Business Insider, 2025)\nCompanies Standing Firm on DEI\nCostco Wholesale Corporation: Costco's shareholders recently overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to investigate the company's DEI policies, with 98% voting against it. This decision underscores Costco's commitment to its DEI initiatives despite external pressures. (Reuters, 2025)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.: CEO Jamie Dimon has strongly defended the company's DEI efforts, highlighting their importance to innovation and financial results. JPMorgan continues to uphold its diversity initiatives amidst the changing political landscape. (Business Insider, 2025)\nInvestor and Market Reactions\nWall Street\u2019s Response: Investor sentiment is divided. Some shareholders urge companies to maintain DEI commitments, viewing them as essential to long-term growth, while others advocate for a neutral approach to avoid legal entanglements.\nConsumer Sentiment Trends: Recent surveys indicate that 70% of Gen Z and Millennial consumers prefer to buy from companies that prioritize workplace diversity. (Business Insider, 2025)\nStock Performance and Risk: Companies that make abrupt changes to DEI policies risk reputational damage, employee disengagement, and stock fluctuations due to investor uncertainty.\nRebranding DEI Strategies Without Political Backlash\nSome corporations are reframing their DEI efforts under different terminology:\nInclusive Leadership Development: Replacing \u201cDEI training\u201d with leadership-focused programs that highlight diverse perspectives without political connotations.\nWorkplace Culture and Innovation Programs: Shifting language toward \u201cworkplace culture enhancement\u201d rather than explicit DEI branding.\nBroadening Diversity Strategies: Expanding programs beyond race and gender to include economic diversity, skills-based hiring, and professional development for all employees.\nKey Takeaway: Simply renaming initiatives isn\u2019t enough. Employees, job seekers, and investors demand measurable impact rather than performative rebranding efforts.\nChallenges in Employee Engagement and Retention\nInternal morale is emerging as a significant concern as companies alter their DEI strategies:\nEmployee Pushback: Workforces previously engaged in DEI programs are expressing frustration over abrupt changes, leading to lower morale and potential retention issues.\nRecruitment Challenges: Companies that cut diversity hiring programs may struggle to attract top talent, as job seekers increasingly prioritize inclusive workplaces, as 70% of Gen Z & Millennials prefer inclusive workplaces ([Business Insider, 2025])..\nTrust and Transparency: Business leaders must carefully communicate policy changes to avoid eroding trust within their organizations.\nThe Future of Corporate DEI: What Happens Next?\nThe corporate response to Trump\u2019s executive order is more than just a policy shift.\nIt\u2019s a turning point for businesses, employees, and job seekers.\nSome companies are stepping away from DEI due to legal and political pressures, while others are reinforcing their commitment to inclusion, recognizing that workplace diversity isn\u2019t just about compliance. it\u2019s about business growth, innovation, and long-term success.\nWhat does this mean for you?

      "text": "Controversy surrounding \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d (DEI) programs is neither new nor surprising. But since the beginning of 2025, increased challenges and scrutiny of the term DEI itself has called into question the state of its future existence.\nAt the start of his administration, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders aimed at putting an end to illegal \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d (DEI) policies and programs, now referred to as \u201cillegal DEI.\u201d The executive orders, while mainly directed at federal government agencies, also impact other sectors, including private companies, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations. Accordingly, it is important that employers from all industries stay updated with the current state of DEI because although the executive orders do not change the existing law regarding discrimination, they have prompted scrutiny, suspicion, investigation and enforcement activities on DEI programs and policies.\nFirst, Executive Order 14151, titled \u201cEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\u201d asserts that the Biden Administration has \u201cforced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name \u2018diversity, equity, and inclusion\u2019 (DEI) \u2026\u201d The order directs, among others, \u201cthe termination of all discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and \u2018diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\u2019 (DEIA) mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government \u2026\u201d Executive Order 14151 also directs federal agencies, departments, and commission heads to \u201cterminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law \u2026 \u2018equity-related\u2019 grants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees.\u201d\nSecond, Executive Order 14173, or \u201cEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunities,\u201d revokes several prior orders aimed at equal employment opportunity and the promotion of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. One of Executive Order 14173\u2019s directives are to the heads of all agencies to submit a report, within 120 days of the order (by May 20, 2025), \u201ccontaining recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\u201d The report must include \u201cthe most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern\u201d and a \u201cplan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles \u2026 that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\u201d\nThe executive orders do not define \u201cillegal DEI,\u201d and currently, at least two lawsuits had been filed challenging these orders. However, despite the legal challenges, the executive orders have prompted many major companies to scale back or dismantle their DEI programs altogether. While the impact of these measures on the workplace remains to be seen, it is clear government agencies will be looking for \u201cillegal DEI\u201d and there is a potential increase in litigation with lawsuits testing the definitions of the executive orders\u2019 terms and provisions.\nOn March 19, 2025, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) jointly released two technical assistance documents that was said to be \u201cfocused on educating the public about unlawful discrimination related to \u2018diversity, equity, and inclusion\u2019 (DEI) in the workplace.\u201d The jointly released document titled, \u201cWhat To Do If You Experience Discrimination Related to DEI at Work,\u201d describes what \u201cDEI-related discrimination\u201d can look like and who can be affected by it. Among the description of DEI-related discrimination include:\n(1) disparate treatment, \u201cwhere an employer takes an employment action motivated (in whole or in part) by race, sex, or another characteristic;\u201d\n(2) limiting, segregating, and classifying employees based on race, sex, or other protected characteristics, \u201csuch as Employee Resource Groups (ERG) or other affinity groups\u201d that limit membership in workplace groups to certain protected groups and \u201cseparating employees into groups based on race, sex, or another protected characteristic when administering DEI or other trainings;\u201d\n(3) \u201cworkplace harassment, which may occur when an employee is subjected to unwelcome remarks or conduct based on race, sex, or other protected characteristics\u201d; and\n(4) \u201cretaliation by an employer because an individual has engaged in protected activity under the statute, such as objecting to or opposing employment discrimination related to DEI \u2026\u201d\nThe technical assistance document also noted that \u201c[d]epending on the facts, DEI training may give rise to a colorable hostile work environment claim\u201d and \u201c[r]easonable opposition to a DEI training may constitute protected activity if the employee provides a fact-specific basis for his or her belief that the training violates Title VII.\u201d The EEOC and DOJ do not provide any examples of these facts that may give rise to workplace harassment or retaliation based on DEI, but it is fair to anticipate that sooner rather than later, we will see lawsuits testing what those facts are.\nWhile President Trump\u2019s first two executive orders aimed at DEI has increased the potential for litigation with challenges to DEI policies or programs, there is one theory of liability that the Trump Administration has aimed to eliminate: \u201cdisparate-impact\u201d discrimination.\nOn April 23. 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14281, titled \u201cRestoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy,\u201d which aims \u201cto eliminate the use of disparate impact liability in all contexts to the maximum degree possible.\u201d \u201cDisparate impact\u201d liability is a legal theory where an employer can be held liable for facially neutral policies or practices that have a disparate impact on a group of applicants or employees based on a protected characteristic, even without intentional discrimination. According to the executive order, disparate impact liability \u201crequires individuals and businesses to consider race and engage in racial balancing to avoid potentially crippling legal liability. It not only undermines our national values, but also runs contrary to equal protection under the law and, therefore, violates our Constitution.\u201d\nHowever, while Executive Order 14281 directs federal agencies to \u201cdeprioritize enforcement of all statutes and regulations to the extent they include disparate-impact liability,\u201d it does not immediately change the law, and disparate impact remains a recognized theory of liability. Accordingly, employers should continue to monitor their policies and practices for potential disparate impact.\nMoreover, employers with existing DEI policies or programs should conduct an audit, preferably by an attorney, of their DEI policies and programs to identify potential risks. Again, while the executive orders do not define \u201cillegal DEI,\u201d based on the EEOC and DOJ technical assistance document, employers should consider that any recruitment policy or program that sets quotas for persons of certain protected characteristics, or any program that limits, segregates or classifies applicants or employees based on race, sex or other protected characteristics, are risky and likely to lead to lawsuits.\nFinally, employers have responded in various ways to President Trump\u2019s executive orders, from scaling back to dismantling their DEI programs, to reaffirming their commitment to DEI. Based on these various responses, it is uncertain what the future of DEI will look like. The only certainty for now is that the fight for and against DEI continues. The scrutiny and investigation into DEI policies and programs continues and more lawsuits will likely follow. Therefore, it is important for companies to stay updated with new developments in this area of the law. Consult your counsel with questions you may have about your DEI policies and programs.\nThis AALRR publication is intended for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon in reaching a conclusion in a particular area of law.

      "text": "- 1 in 5 Companies Eliminated DEI Since Trump\u2019s Reelection\n- Majority of Companies That Made Cuts to DEI Are Hiring Fewer Underrepresented Workers\n- 1 in 3 Companies That Slashed DEI Efforts Are Promoting Fewer Underrepresented Employees\n- Business Leaders Report Mixed Feelings About Their Company\u2019s DEI Cuts\nIn July, Resume.org surveyed 965 companies that had diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs before November 2024 to understand how these initiatives have changed since President Trump\u2019s election.\nMajor takeaways:\n- 1 in 5 companies eliminated DEI since Trump\u2019s reelection\n- 10% of companies with DEI programs reduced their investment\n- 57% of companies that eliminated DEI report decreases in hiring of one or more underrepresented groups\n- 1 in 3 companies that cut DEI programs report promoting fewer underrepresented workers\n- Half of companies that cut DEI say morale is down, and 1 in 5 say reports of discrimination and bias are up\n1 in 5 Companies Eliminated DEI Since Trump\u2019s Reelection\nSince President Trump\u2019s reelection in November 2024, 20% of companies have eliminated their DEI programs entirely. Among the 80% of companies that still have a DEI program, the majority (71%) say it hasn\u2019t changed, but 11% report reducing their efforts.\nOf those that scaled back or cut DEI altogether, the top reason \u2014 cited by 74% of business leaders \u2014 is a shift in the political climate.\nMany companies that haven\u2019t eliminated DEI initiatives since Trump\u2019s election are considering doing so. About 16% are likely to eliminate their program by the end of 2025, and another 7% expect to do so within the next four years.\nWhile some companies are backing away from DEI, business leaders are conflicted. Most agree that these initiatives meaningfully improved diversity and inclusion and are key drivers of employee satisfaction and retention.\nMajority of Companies That Made Cuts to DEI Are Hiring Fewer Underrepresented Workers\nAmong those that eliminated DEI programs, 57% report hiring fewer underrepresented workers. More specifically, 37% say hiring of women of color has declined, along with 33% who report fewer LGBTQIA+ hires, 33% who report fewer men of color being hired, and 26% who say hiring of people with disabilities has declined. About 13% report fewer white women being hired.\nIn contrast, the decline in hiring white candidates has been notably smaller: 12% report a drop in hiring white men.\nThese disparities suggest that reductions in DEI efforts disproportionately affect already underrepresented groups.\n\u201cEliminating DEI programs, particularly due to political pressure, is short-sighted and creates long-term risks,\u201d says Kara Dennison, head of career advising at Resume.org. \u201cCompanies that cut DEI programs are hiring fewer underrepresented employees, leading to reduced innovation, lower performance, and weaker talent pipelines. Many report declining morale and rising incidents of discrimination, signaling damage to culture and psychological safety.\n\u201cDEI initiatives shouldn\u2019t be political; they should be strategic. They can help attract top talent, foster inclusive leadership, and boost retention, especially among younger and more diverse employees. Companies that abandon DEI risk reputational harm, disengagement, and an inability to adapt to an increasingly global, values-driven marketplace.\u201d\n1 in 3 Companies That Slashed DEI Efforts Are Promoting Fewer Underrepresented Employees\nNearly half of companies (47%) that pulled back on DEI report a decline in employee morale, and 39% say they\u2019ve reduced benefits that were originally tied to DEI.\nAdditionally, more than one-third of companies report a drop in both retention (36%) and attraction (35%) of diverse talent. Roughly 3 in 10 acknowledge fewer promotions for underrepresented employees (30%) and decreased leadership representation for people of color (30%). Meanwhile, 24% report fewer women in leadership roles. Some companies are experiencing reputational damage (25%), and 18% report an increase in workplace discrimination or bias-related incidents.\n\u201cSlashing DEI programs often leads to immediate declines in morale and retention, especially among underrepresented employees who no longer feel supported or valued. DEI fosters belonging and psychological safety, which are critical to employee engagement and loyalty. Without it, trust erodes and turnover increases,\u201d says Dennison.\n\u201cRemoving DEI signals that inclusion is no longer a priority, which can encourage harmful behavior and silence affected voices. This creates a toxic culture, weakens future leadership, and puts both reputation and performance at risk.\u201d\nBusiness Leaders Report Mixed Feelings About Their Company\u2019s DEI Cuts\nWhile many companies reduced or eliminated DEI programs in response to political pressure or shifting priorities, reactions from business leaders reveal a stark divide in how those decisions are perceived internally.\nSome respondents expressed frustration with DEI efforts, describing them as counterproductive or harmful to workplace culture. Several saw DEI initiatives as performative or divisive, and felt their removal restored a sense of fairness:\n- \u201cIt has caused more problems than it solved. White employees felt discriminated against, causing workplace tension.\u201d\n- \u201cDEI in the workplace was a totally worthless program. Really did nothing for the employees but possibly hindered development.\u201d\n- \u201cDEI was very divisive. Good that we eliminated it.\u201d\n\u201cMy company\u2019s DEI practices were very obviously performative and didn\u2019t drive any real change or improvements at all.\u201d\nOthers voiced disappointment or concern about the consequences of pulling back on diversity initiatives. They pointed to reduced morale, reputational damage, and the loss of progress made in recent years:\n- \u201cIt seems to have stalled due to budgetary concerns and possibly due to the political environment. I would prefer that it have been maintained, if not expanded.\u201d\n\u201cDEI was valuable, and I\u2019m very disappointed that it has been eliminated.\u201d - \u201cWe are worse off as a company and our place in society since dropping the DEI policy.\u201d\n- \u201cI thought DEI created a safe space for us all. It allowed us to feel represented. The company removed them with no notice and did not provide any mention of it or reasoning.\u201d\nMethodology: Resume.org commissioned this survey, and it was conducted via Pollfish in July 2025.
