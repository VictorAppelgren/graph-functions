  "title": "For a Reporter, Writing About Bear Attacks in Romania Was a Homecoming of Sorts",
  "description": "A reporter visiting Romania, where she was born, found that humans\u2019 ancient relationship with bears there had fallen out of balance.",
  "content": "Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\n\nBetween 10,000 and 13,000 brown bears live in Romania, which has the largest population of the animal in Europe outside Russia. Brown bears are embedded in Romanian national identity. But human encroachment on wild lands \u2014 and ursine population growth since a 2016 hunting moratorium \u2014 has thrown the human-bear relationship out of balance.\n\nBear attacks are rising. Rural villagers have been mauled while tending to their fields. Since 2016, bears have killed 20 people, according to a report by the National Institute for Research and Development in Forestry.\n\nRukmini Callimachi, a reporter on The New York Times\u2019s Real Estate desk, was born in Romania and was a young girl when her family fled the country\u2019s Communist rule in 1979. She spent enough of her youth there to understand the symbolism of the bear.\n\nThis summer, while on a reporting trip in Romania, Ms. Callimachi found that a source of national pride had also become a problem. The Real Estate section published her story this month.",
