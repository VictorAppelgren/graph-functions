  "title": "Review: 'Long Story Short' is a moving tale of a modern Jewish American family",
  "description": "The animated Netflix series from Raphael Bob-Waksberg, creator of 'BoJack Horseman,' centers on a middle-class Jewish family and their interpersonal relationships.",
  "content": "\u201cLong Story Short,\u201d premiering Friday on Netflix, is the sweet, melancholy, satirical, silly, poignant, hopeful, sometimes slapstick cartoon tale of a middle-class Jewish family, told nonchronologically from the 1990s to the 2020s. For all its exaggerations \u2014 and unexaggerated portrayals of exaggerated behaviors \u2014 it is remarkably acute, and surprisingly moving, about relations between parents and children and brothers and sisters and about the passage of time and the lives time contains. The eight-episode season is bookended with funerals.\n\nOn a plane ride home, Avi Schwooper (Ben Feldman), his last name combining his parents\u2019 Schwartz and Cooper, plays new girlfriend Jen (Angelique Cabral) a recording of Paul Simon\u2019s \u201cThe Obvious Child,\u201d in which a character goes from a baby to a married man in the space of a verse. \u201cThat\u2019s time, right?\u201d he says, setting a theme and a strategy. In the episodes that follow, we\u2019ll see relationships begin and end; children born and grown, not necessarily in that order. Things change, things fall apart, things last.\n\nCreated by \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg \u2014 Avi is drawn to resemble him \u2014 and designed by Lisa Hanawalt (who inspired and designed the \u201cBoJack\u201d characters and created \u201cTuca & Bertie\u201d), it has the look of a children\u2019s book, bright, colorful and busy, aggressively two-dimensional, with wobbly bold lines and squiggly patterns. Deceptively sophisticated and wonderfully expressive, it is full of lifelike details, without being made to resemble life.\n\nAvi\u2019s parents are Naomi Schwartz (Lisa Edelstein), intense and serious, and Elliot Cooper (Paul Reiser), laid-back and humorous. Avi, who writes about music, will go on to marry Jen (blond, gentile); Hannah (Michaela Dietz) is their smart, socially isolated daughter. Avi\u2019s sister Shira (Abbi Jacobson), the angry middle child, will start a family with Kendra (Nicole Byer), a Black woman who is Jewish by choice. Younger brother Yoshi (Max Greenfield) is a bit of a lost soul \u2014 \u201csometimes I just feel like the extra one,\u201d he\u2019ll say \u2014 diagnosed as an adolescent with ADD, dyslexia and executive function disorder. (\u201cI never gave him enough attention,\u201d Naomi says, rushing to claim the guilt. \u201cNow he has a deficit.\u201d)\n\nThough each episode is a piece in the mosaic, each has its own story to tell: Yoshi selling mattresses that come in a tube; Avi mixed up with self-righteous parents as he campaigns to remove wolves from Hannah\u2019s school (the wolves, by contrast, are drawn realistically); Kendra at work at a birthday arcade called BJ Barnacles; Yoshi on a nocturnal adventure in San Francisco \u2014 the show is set around the Bay Area \u2014 with a former friend of his sister, attempting to retrieve a lost bag; Shira attempting to make her mother\u2019s knishes; an improvised shabbat in a desert motel. There are inside family jokes (\u201cIs not a schnook,\u201d Cousin Moishe) that will pay off after a while; a school holiday pageant (\u201cHanukkah, Ramadan, Kwanzaa too / We tolerate them all, but there\u2019s nothing like Christmas,\u201d runs a song in the background). Yoshi has a bar mitzvah; Naomi is honored for her charitable work. Occasional weird inventions are folded in: a \u201chambulance\u201d delivering ham; food trucks selling potato ice cream and soup on a stick; something called Pacifier Shirt Syndrome, caused by rubbing a dropped pacifier on a short.\n\nAlthough I suspect this subject is interesting only to (us) Jews, it took a long time for any sort of Jewish specificity to make it to the screen, especially given who built the movie business. (Assimilation was the name of the game for a people blamed for a scapegoated race.) Even now, it doesn\u2019t happen all that much. You could sense it on \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d see it on \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d a lot. There are the current Netflix rom-com \u201cNobody Wants This,\u201d with Kristen Bell in a relationship with Adam Brody\u2019s rabbi, and the recent Adam Sandler-produced \u201cYou Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah.\u201d And there is the odd Holocaust drama.\n\nBut in this moment, with its confounding mix of classical antisemitism, fake anti-antisemitism brandished as a weapon against universities and what gets called antisemitism simply because it\u2019s critical of Israel, it\u2019s not a bad thing to get a relatively straightforward look at a contemporary American Jewish family. Together, the characters represent the spectrum of religious attitudes \u2014 from atheist to convert, selectively to very observant \u2014 but all are steeped in the culture.\n\nHannah, whose gentile mother makes her \u201cnot Jewish,\u201d wonders if her wanting a bat mitzvah might be \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, if Adolf Hitler saw you, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be doing the math on technically how halachically Jewish you are,\u201d says her father. \u201cHe\u2019d throw you in the oven with the rest of us. \u2026 If you\u2019re Jewish enough for Hitler, you\u2019re Jewish enough for me.\u201d\n\nThat the show can be a little obscure from time to time \u2014 I had to look up \u201cMoshiach\u201d to get one joke \u2014 just deepens its world. But anyone who\u2019s ever shared a family joke, or wanted to ask a question of someone no longer around to answer it, or compared notes with a sibling on a parent never fully understood will recognize themself here.",

      "text": "- Share via\nThis fall, there are more than a few mysteries to be uncovered, whether it\u2019s by a group of retired amateur sleuths, an FBI task force, a group of children living in small-town Maine or the only unhappy woman in the world \u2014 trust us, the last isn\u2019t as dour as it seems (there are donuts). If you would rather stay grounded in reality, streaming documentaries with subjects ranging from Sarah McLachlan to Martin Scorsese to the American Revolution will do just the trick while giving you perspective about the music and film industries and America\u2019s Founding Fathers. But if you prefer to detach and have some laughs, there are several comedies and dramedies that will do just that. And that\u2019s the democratic nature of television \u2014 there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\u2018The Thursday Murder Club\u2019\n(Netflix, Aug. 28)\nThe first of Richard Osman\u2018s wonderful series of novels concerning a group of British retirees who recreationally solve murders has become an almost-straight-to-Netflix feature with a cast that in olden times would have guaranteed a long theatrical ride. Helen Mirren plays Elizabeth, with a background in intelligence; Pierce Brosnan is Ron, a combative ex-trade unionist; Ben Kingsley plays Ibrahim, a shy former psychiatrist; and Celia Imrie is Joyce, the chirpy newcomer, with Naomi Ackie as Donna, the bored police officer who falls under their collective spell. (Plus David Tennant, Richard E. Grant and Jonathan Pryce, if that isn\u2019t enough British thespian firepower for you.) As a fan of the books, I will approach it with some trepidation, but I will absolutely approach it. \u2014 Robert Lloyd\nThe Irish actor stars as an idealistic editor in chief of a Midwest newspaper that he\u2019s trying to revive with the help of his ragtag staff.\n\u2018Task\u2019\n(HBO, Sept. 7)\nCrime dramas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes one stands out from the crowd and keeps you hooked. The latest HBO series from Brad Ingelsby, who famously brought us Kate Winslet in a Delco accent in \u201cMare of Easttown,\u201d may well do that. Like \u201cMare,\u201d it is also set in Pennsylvania, but this time the story revolves around an FBI agent named Tom played by Mark Ruffalo, who is charged with leading a task force to uncover who is behind a string of robberies. Parallel to his story is that of Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) and his best friend Cliff (Ra\u00fal Castillo), sanitation workers who are trying to make ends meet. Secrets, twists and turns lie ahead that bridge their stories together and make you question the gray areas between good, bad, wrong and right. \u2014 Maira Garcia\n\u2018Black Rabbit\u2019\n(Netflix, Sept. 18)\nBetween TV series (\u201cOzark\u201d), films (\u201cCarry-On\u201d), podcasts (\u201cSmartLess\u201d) and commercials (State Farm Insurance), Jason Bateman is one of the busiest performers in Hollywood. He returns to Netflix in a limited series, \u201cBlack Rabbit,\u201d which teams him with Jude Law. The project features Law as Jake Friedkin, the owner of New York\u2019s popular Black Rabbit restaurant and VIP lounge who runs into trouble when his brother Vince (Bateman) returns years after going on the lam after running up a mountain of gambling debts. Bateman also directs the first two episodes, and is an executive producer along with Law. \u2014 Greg Braxton\n\u2018Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery\u2019\n(Hulu, Sept. 21)\nSweet nostalgia. Lilith Fair was the first music festival I ever attended as an awkward, introverted teen, and it was the first time I was surrounded by thousands of (mostly) women who I knew felt absolutely free to be themselves. Of course I\u2019d want to relive that. For those who need a refresher, Lilith Fair was a traveling music festival founded by Sarah McLachlan and others to prove the sexist standards that existed in the music industry in the 1990s were morally and financially wrong. Featuring artists like Sheryl Crow, Liz Phair, Queen Latifah, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor, the Indigo Girls and many others, the festival made more than 130 stops over its original three-summer run. Directed by Ally Pankiw and touting Dan Levy as one of its producers, \u201cLilith Fair: Building a Mystery\u201d mined over 600 hours of never-before-seen footage and features interviews with the festival\u2019s organizers, musicians and fans. \u2014 Tracy Brown\n\u2018The Lowdown\u2019\n(FX, Sept. 23)\nSterlin Harjo, who last gave us \u201cReservation Dogs,\u201d is back with another Oklahoma-set series, a noir excursion loosely based on citizen journalist Lee Roy Chapman. Ethan Hawke, here called Lee Raybon, is a Tulsa amateur \u201ctruthstorian\u201d and rare book dealer, working and living in a store where the cool people hang out. His yen to cure civic rot in the light of day brings him into the orbit of a powerful family, including a suicide (Tim Blake Nelson), a widow (Jeanne Tripplehorn), and a candidate for governor (Kyle MacLachlan). Kaniehtiio Horn, the Deer Lady on \u201cRez Dogs,\u201d plays his ex-wife because in a show like this, any wife is bound to be an ex, with Ryan Kiera Armstrong as their Nancy Drew of a teenage daughter, and Keith David bringing his formidable Keith David-ness. \u2014 R.L.\nFX\u2019s \u2018The Lowdown,\u2019 starring Ethan Hawke, is centered on creator, writer and director Sterlin Harjo\u2019s Oklahoma hometown.\n\u2018Slow Horses\u2019\nSeason 5 (Apple TV+, Sept. 24)\nThe long, and for some of us agonizing, wait is over for the best spy drama on TV. Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) and his MI5 Slough House misfits are at it again, bumbling into all manner of international and inner-departmental intrigue, with their signature results of mess and mayhem. Computer-genius man-child Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung) plays a central figure in this year\u2019s race against time, River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) continues to agonize over the plight of his aging grandfather (Jonathan Pryce) and his own determination to get back to the Park, where Second Desk Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) remains under the authority of twitchily incompetent First Desk Claude Whelan (James Callis, having a grand old time.) Pulling everyone\u2019s strings is, of course, Lamb \u2014 whether goading his assistant Catherine Standish (Saskia Reeves), locking horns with Taverner or talking his way out of virtually any situation, Lamb is the most noisome, flatulent, stringy-haired super spy ever to grace any screen and it is impossible to imagine a world without him. \u2014 Mary McNamara\n\u2018House of Guinness\u2019\n(Netflix, Sept. 25)\nArthur Guinness, the founder of the world\u2019s most iconic beer, had 21 children. Only 10 of them survived to adulthood and only four represent the family in this Netflix series. But in the hands of creator Steven Knight, best known for \u201cPeaky Blinders,\u201d four appear to be quite enough. Following their father\u2019s death, Arthur (Anthony Boyle), Edward (Louis Partridge), Benjamin (Fionn O\u2019Shea) and Anne (Emily Fairn) must navigate all manner of tensions and threats, including the draconian terms of their father\u2019s will, violent Fenian protests (Guinness senior was a Protestant who believed in Catholic rights but not Irish self-rule) and various affairs of the heart \u2014 Anne smolders early on at the sight of brewery overseer Sean Rafferty (James Norton). Many creative liberties were taken, no doubt, but the inevitable \u201cSuccession\u201d meets \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d (by way of \u201cRebellion\u201d) description is apt enough. As the adverts for the black stuff say, it is a lovely day for Guinness. \u2014 M.M.\n\u2018IT: Welcome to Derry\u2019\n(HBO, October)\nYou just can\u2019t put a terrifying clown down. Almost 40 years have passed since Stephen King terrified readers with \u201cIT,\u201d his massive novel about a vicious clown named Pennywise who targets the children of Derry, Maine. A 1990 miniseries and two theatrical films followed. \u201cWelcome to Derry\u201d continues the \u201cIT\u201c-verse as a prequel set in the 1960s before the \u201cIT\u201d and \u201cIT Chapter 2\u201d films. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd reprises his portrayal of Pennywise as the series unveils the origins of the menacing clown, while also spotlighting a group of residents wrestling with their own fears and demons. Andy Muschietti, who directed the \u201cIT\u201d films, helped develop the series and is one of the executive producers. The cast includes Jovan Adepo and Taylour Paige. \u2014 G.B.\n\u2018Boots\u2019\n(Netflix, Oct. 9)\nChoosing to join the military can be construed as a major act of patriotism, but oftentimes it is a very personal decision that involves a lot of a sacrifice \u2014 choices like where you will live, what you do on a day-to-day basis and who you work with are dictated. Enter Cameron Cope (Miles Heizer), a gay, bullied high school graduate who isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s next until his best friend Ray McAffey (Liam Oh) \u2014 the only person he\u2019s come out to \u2014 suggests they join the Marines. Cameron imagines the military to be like summer camp, until reality sets in. This dramedy is set in the \u201890s, when being gay in the military was still grounds for discharge, so not only does Cameron have to endure the brutality of boot camp, he has to keep his sexual orientation a secret. The series is based on \u201cThe Pink Marine,\u201d a memoir by Greg Cope White, who serves as a writer. \u2014 M.G.\n\u2018DMV\u2019\n(CBS, Oct. 13)\nYour local department of motor vehicles may seem like the very last place to get a laugh, but CBS has managed to pull it off. Its new workplace comedy centers on a ragtag group of employees who work at an East Hollywood DMV: Gregg (Tim Meadows), a former English teacher; Colette (Harriet Dyer of \u201cColin From Accounts\u201d), a driving examiner with few boundaries; Vic (Tony Cavalero), a former bouncer; Cici (Gigi Zumbado), an outspoken photographer; and Noa (Alex Tarrant), a handsome surfer whom Colette has her eye on. They\u2019re led by newly minted manager Barbara (\u201cSNL\u201d alum Molly Kearney, delightful to see onscreen again), who becomes dismayed when some consultants arrive \u2014 no matter where you work, that\u2019s never a good sign. Despite work and interpersonal turmoil, they make a fun and funny team that should be a welcome addition to CBS\u2019 fall lineup. \u2014 M.G.\n\u2018Mr. Scorsese\u2019\n(Apple TV+, Oct. 17)\nAmong the biggest challenges for documentary filmmakers of major figures is figuring out not only how to gain access but also the trust of your subject. The ability to get them to open up can turn an interesting documentary into a great one. And when the subject is Martin Scorsese, one of America\u2019s great auteurs, you want the full portrait of a director who helped shape cinema with iconic films like \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d \u201cGangs of New York\u201d and, most recently, \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Director Rebecca Miller (\u201cShe Came to Me,\u201d \u201cPersonal Velocity\u201d) seems up for the task, having created a five-part docuseries that\u2019s billed as the definitive portrait of 82-year-old Scorsese and will premiere at New York Film Festival this fall. \u2014 M.G.\n\u2018Nobody Wants This\u2019\nSeason 2 (Netflix, Oct. 23)\nThere will inevitably come a time when the drip-drop of wholesome, rom-com-level video content of Pamela Anderson and Liam Neeson on their \u201cNaked Gun\u201d promotional tour will loosen its grip on my social media algorithms, and I\u2019ll return to longing for a fictional romantic comedy to fill the void. That\u2019s where Adam Brody \u2014 who really propelled the art of the neck-hugging smooch combo \u2014 and Kristen Bell come in. The first season made millennial hearts squeal with its pairing of Brody and Bell \u2014 two decades after they rose to fame in the early aughts on teen dramas \u201cThe O.C.\u201d and \u201cVeronica Mars,\u201d respectively \u2014 in a delightful will they/won\u2019t they set in L.A. Bell is Joanne, a woman who often regales about her single life on the podcast she co-hosts with her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe), while Brody\u2019s Noah is a progressive rabbi who is newly single. But can their relationship make it past hurdles that include their careers, family and religion? The first season ended with a showstopping kiss that suggested they\u2019re willing to give it a try. The sophomore outing promises to unpack what that looks like. Let\u2019s just hope no one in this couple-with-obstacles is proposing a five-year waiting period to deal with personal matters before really giving it a go. (IYKYK.) Plus, \u201cGossip Girl\u201d alumnus Leighton Meester, Brody\u2019s wife IRL, joins the fun, playing Joanne\u2019s childhood nemesis. \u2014 Yvonne Villarreal\n\u2018Star Wars: Visions\u2019\nVol. 3 (Disney+, Oct. 29)\nDave Filoni\u2019s rise at Lucasfilm is proof enough that some of \u201cStar Wars\u2019\u201d best storytelling has happened in animation. My favorite has been \u201cStar Wars: Visions,\u201d an anthology series where international animation houses have been given the freedom to explore their ideas about the Force and the galaxy far, far away outside of the constraints of the franchise\u2019s existing canon. For the first season, Lucasfilm tapped Japanese anime studios for nine shorts, which featured a range of stories including those that centered an ex-Sith ronin, a Jedi Padawan turned lead singer of a rock band and even a Force-wielding droid. The series went even more global for its second season, with studios from Europe, Asia and South America being among those that were enlisted for their takes. The upcoming third season brings the focus back to Japanese anime, with sequels to three of the shorts from Season 1 \u2014 including my favorite, \u201cThe Village Bride\u201d \u2014 among the lineup. \u2014 T.B.\n\u2018Last Samurai Standing\u2019\n(Netflix, November)\nWhen I saw this series described as \u201c\u2018Sh\u014dgun\u2019 meets \u2018Squid Game,\u2019\u201d I had two competing reactions. There was the part of me that was slightly skeptical seeing a logline that leaned on two of the biggest Asian-led shows ever, but the part of me that grew up on a steady diet of chanbara is excited by the idea of a battle royale with samurai \u2014 and that part has completely won out. Based on the historical novel series \u201cIkusagami\u201d by Shogo Imamura, the Meiji-era set \u201cLast Samurai Standing\u201d will involve 292 warriors assembled at a temple in Kyoto for a deadly game with a massive cash prize. Considering the Meiji period was when the samurai became obsolete, the potential for social commentary mixed in with high-stakes combat seems pretty high. \u2014 T.B.\n\u2018Pluribus\u2019\n(Apple TV+, Nov. 7)\nIf you thought the grainy footage of Ariana Grande surreptitiously licking a doughnut inside an L.A. shop a decade ago sent shivers down your spine \u2014 health codes matter, people! \u2014 the first teaser for Vince Gilligan\u2019s new TV opus is just as chilling to behold. Ditching \u201cBetter Call Saul\u2019s\u201d signature cinnamon roll pastry for the hole-y American staple, the trailer for the new series takes place in the dead of night at an office building and settles on a woman, in a pink uniform, licking the tops of doughnuts one by one \u2014 ASMR at its eeriest \u2014 before placing them back in their box as a sign that reads \u201cHelp yourself!\u201d with a smiley face comes into focus. Uh, what? The series reunites Gilligan with \u201cBetter Call Saul\u2019s\u201d Rhea Seehorn, who was the show\u2019s beating heart with a ponytail as Kim Wexler, a skilled lawyer who gets caught up in the antics and schemes of Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman. In this genre-bending sci-fi drama, she is the most miserable person on Earth who must save the world from happiness \u2014 it\u2019s the sort of TV premise that feels like it was tailor-made for my 2025 fatigue. In addition to Seehorn, the series stars Karolina Wydra (\u201cSneaky Pete\u201d) and Carlos-Manuel Vesga (\u201cThe Hijacking of Flight 601\u201d), and guest stars Miriam Shor (\u201cAmerican Fiction\u201d) and Samba Schutte (\u201cOur Flag Means Death\u201d). It\u2019s already been picked up for a second season so you can go in knowing there are no commitment issues. \u2014 Y.V.\n\u2018The American Revolution\u2019\n(PBS, Nov. 16)\nThe combination of PBS and Ken Burns (with co-directors Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt and writer Geoffrey C. Ward) returns again to improve your mind and remind you that history is not something that can be edited to suit the whims of a king or dictator, but also that it is made up of a variety of stories from a spectrum of participants. In these parlous times, when conspiracy theories are mistaken for truth and experts for enemies, those who might most profit from \u201cThe American Revolution\u201d are perhaps least likely to watch it, but in the course of this six-part, 12-hour foundational tale, anyone is bound to learn something. It will certainly have things to say about how Black and Indigenous people participated in this long moment. And if you have it, send money to your local public broadcaster, who needs it more than ever. \u2014 R.L."

      "text": "The fertile mind of \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019s\u2019 Lisa Hanawalt hatches the surreal \u2018Tuca & Bertie\u2019\n- Share via\nA few episodes into Lisa Hanawalt\u2019s new, terrifically funny animated series \u201cTuca & Bertie,\u201d there\u2019s a moment when a puffin in a pink suit calls a crowded auditorium to attention. In the process, she tidily summarizes the show\u2019s twisted and (yet undeniably human) perspective.\n\u201cLadies and gentle-birds,\u201d the emcee begins, \u201cand plants, humans and sometimes inanimate objects that talk \u2014 what a weird world!\u201d\nEven for Netflix viewers who may be coming to \u201cTuca & Bertie\u201d from Hanawalt\u2019s other television job \u2014 character designer and producer of the biting yet melancholy Hollywood satire \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d created by her longtime friend Raphael Bob-Waksberg, who also executive produces the new show \u2014 the statement can\u2019t be denied.\nFeaturing stand-up stars Ali Wong and Tiffany Haddish as a pair of bird best friends at the cusp of their 30s, their home of Birdtown is a freewheeling dreamscape where the subway is a snake and freeways loop like roller coasters around cat-infested yarn hillsides and lakes of grape jelly. A few scenes incorporate snippets of live action and claymation and, at one point, Bertie drives her car off the road and her profanity, spilling from the window in puffy balloons of text, builds a bridge to safety.\nAt times capturing a hallucinogenic meeting between \u201cBroad City\u201d and Tex Avery, \u201cTuca & Bertie\u201d stands in a strange territory all its own.\n\u201cHaving worked on \u2018BoJack\u2019 for \u2014 now I\u2019m working on the sixth season \u2014 it felt fun to me to have an opportunity to break the rules a bit and create a different universe where things are a little more loosey-goosey and surreal,\u201d says the 35-year-old Hanawalt on a recent phone call. \u201cAnd closer to my personal work, where plants can walk around and wear clothing, and there are boobs on buildings. That really is more like my comics and my own little world.\u201d\nBut for all the visual goofiness, playful puns and anything-goes sense of comic adventure, \u201cTuca & Bertie\u201d remains grounded in very human realities. Though rendered in candy-colored hues and framed by a sunny, dance-funk soundtrack, the series fearlessly but beautifully makes room for issues around childhood trauma, social anxiety and sexual harassment in a way not dissimilar from \u201cBoJack\u2019s\u201d candid depictions of depression.\n\u201cI want to get into that dark stuff because that\u2019s part of growing up as well, and that\u2019s what I like about working with Raphael,\u201d says Hanawalt. \u201cWe\u2019re both really drawn to things that are both extremely funny, silly and surreal, and then extremely dark and relatable.\u201d\nThat said, while \u201cBoJack\u201d and \u201cTuca & Bertie\u201d from a visual standpoint were born of the same imagination, they exist a great distance from one another.\n\u201cI have zero interest in creating \u2018BoJack 2\u2019,\u201d Hanawalt says. \u201cI like things a little a grosser, more surreal, more bodily humor, and I\u2019m interested in different story lines. \u2018BoJack\u2019 is not the show I would have created or written, and \u2018Tuca & Bertie\u2019 is not the show that Raphael would write.\u201d\nWhile TV has grown more adept with nuanced story lines that years ago would have struggled for airtime or even an appropriate level of honesty if forced to run between detergent ads, there\u2019s something about Hanawalt\u2019s line-drawn, anthropomorphized aesthetic that creates a powerful Trojan horse for much heavier material.\nWhether it\u2019s Tuca reflecting on the loss of her mother or Bertie describing a nightmarish incident from her childhood, the mix of image and storytelling makes an emotional impact that live action struggles to approach.\n\u201cSomething about making them cute little birds kind of makes it more universal,\u201d Hanawalt says. \u201cIf you\u2019re seeing a human on-screen you have a very specific association with whatever human you\u2019re seeing; they remind you of someone. But if it\u2019s a cartoon animal, then it\u2019s not as specific, it\u2019s more universal, so maybe it\u2019s easier to project yourself onto that.\n\u201cWe love looking at animals and thinking about their interior lives, and that\u2019s a big part of it too. Because I just really like drawing them,\u201d she adds. \u201cMaybe it makes it even more shocking at times.\u201d\nBefore Hanawalt\u2019s drawings helped illustrate a struggle with depression in \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d she was an indie cartoonist and illustrator who produced three books. Born in Palo Alto and a graduate from UCLA in 2006, the independent-minded Hanawalt needed some persuading before agreeing to work on \u201cBoJack,\u201d which she feared would dominate too much of her time. The series debuted in 2014, and that same year she won a James Beard Award for humor with a comic about chef Wylie Dufresne that ran in the late, lamented food magazine Lucky Peach. Still, making her own series wasn\u2019t always the goal.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to make a lot of plans because I\u2019m just worried I\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a surprise to me when \u2018BoJack\u2019 actually got picked up by Netflix; it was a surprise to me when it actually aired and when it got picked up for another season. It was a surprise to me that \u2018Tuca & Bertie\u2019 actually came to fruition.\n\u201cEvery time I get the opportunity to do something, I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, sure, why not? I\u2019ll give it a chance.\u2019 But I never actually expect it to go anywhere,\u201d she adds with a laugh.\nIn her 2016 book, \u201cHot Dog Taste Test,\u201d you can find early cameos from what would grow into \u201cTuca & Bertie\u201d with stories of an outgoing toucan attempting to buy a swimsuit and a sweater-wearing songbird struggling with intimacy as she moves in with her boyfriend. When Bob-Waksberg first began talking with her a few years ago about creating her own show outside of \u201cBoJack,\u201d Hanawalt considered an anthology-style series, but those characters began to stand out.\n\u201c[Tuca] was inspired by my id, the most selfish parts of myself. She\u2019s just a character who likes herself; I just know what she\u2019ll do in every situation,\u201d Hanawalt says. \u201cBertie felt more like what I\u2019m like in real life. I\u2019m actually a little more introverted and anxious. And then when we were talking about show ideas, it just kind of made sense to pair these two characters together and make a show about female friendship.\u201d\nHaving already gotten to know each other on the stand-up circuit, Haddish and Wong had an immediate chemistry as Tuca and Bertie. As Bertie\u2019s live-in boyfriend Speckle, Steven Yeun (of \u201cWalking Dead\u201d and the indie hit \u201cBurning\u201d) displays a deft comic touch, and the series also features a number of big-name cameos courtesy of Hanawalt\u2019s connections to \u201cBoJack\u201d as well as the stand-up scene (along with hosting a podcast with comic Emily Heller, Hanawalt\u2019s romantic partner is Adam Conover of TruTV\u2019s \u201cAdam Ruins Everything\u201d).\nBut in another instance of grounding a decidedly unreal show in reality, Hanawalt also wanted to depict how young women \u2014 or bird-women \u2014 at the cusp of growing up sound and behave. Citing \u201cBroad City\u201d and Hulu\u2019s \u201cPen15\u201d as inspirations, Hanawalt says, \u201cI just love shows that show how funny and gross women actually are, because that\u2019s how I am with my friends, and I don\u2019t see that represented as often as men being men.\n\u201cA lot of adult animation gets pretty raunchy, but it\u2019s all from a male perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cI definitely wanted [\u2018Tuca & Bertie\u2019] to be an adult show with adult themes.\u201d\nWhile this includes more nudity and frank discussion about sex and sexuality than perhaps expected (\u201cPerverts will love it,\u201d Hanawalt says dryly), there\u2019s also the welcome inclusion of a slapstick standby in at least one perfectly timed, perfectly placed flatulence joke. Upon being reminded of the scene, Hanawalt expresses pride in her work.\n\u201cI really carefully chose that fart noise,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, never thought that I would have such strong opinions in a sound mix. I\u2019ve never done this before, whatever, but I was like, \u2018Uh, can we get a smaller fart?\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d she adds with a laugh, \u201chow much funnier it made it.\u201d\nFollow me over here @chrisbarton."

      "text": "- Share via\nFrom the mad sprite Ed Grimley to Oliver Putnam, the flamboyant, forever failing Broadway director he plays in Hulu\u2019s \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d \u2014 for which he\u2019s nominated for an Emmy \u2014 Martin Short has a gift for playing colorful characters who take up a lot of space. This summer he\u2019s become eligible for a different category of Emmy as well, as host of ABC\u2019s \u201cMatch Game.\u201d (Also big, also colorful.)\n\u201cYou reach a point where you\u2019ve done everything,\u201d Short, 75, said by Zoom recently, about taking that job. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t done that. It could be fun \u2014 or it could be a big mistake. And that kind of challenge is still provocative to me.\u201d\nIn Season 4, Hulu\u2019s always surprising true-crime comedy sends up movies and movie actors \u2014 to hilarious and highly watchable effect.\nYou were nominated as lead actor in a comedy this year, but your co-star Steve Martin wasn\u2019t. Did that occasion any interesting conversations between you?\nOh, yeah. Steve called me up midafternoon and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out all day and I\u2019ve been hiking and hiking. Heard anything about the Emmys yet?\u201d But I think Steve\u2019s pretty confident in who he is, what he does.\nIn 1982, you won an Emmy for writing on \u201cSCTV.\u201d As a Canadian, did an American award mean something special to you?\nAbsolutely. Being in Canada, you weren\u2019t in an igloo somewhere; you were living 50 miles from the border. You got CBS, NBC, ABC \u2014 my whole world from the time I was born was watching American television. I knew every show that was on in every hour or half-hour of prime time, on all three networks. And of course, the family in those days watched one show together, so usually parents dictated anyway.\nDid any of that find its way into your own work?\nWhen I was in my 20s, I\u2019d put in a circle beside some script \u201cDVD\u201d or \u201cSL\u201d \u2014 \u201cDo Dick Van Dyke\u201d or \u201cStan Laurel.\u201d You\u2019re not going to do your own style. You don\u2019t have one. I had a lot of \u201cJL,\u201d Jack Lemmon. There was a kind of rhythm, a fast staccato he could get. You were just delighted to see him.\nWhen I was 12 and 13, television was mainly variety shows, Jackie Gleason, Red Skelton, Danny Kaye. And you respond to the sketches and you\u2019re influenced by them. I mean, I was most influenced by Nichols and May; they had a Broadway show that was basically variety, and they played sketches.\nWhen did you first feel you wanted to be part of that world?\nOh, very late. In my mid-20s, I would say.\nBefore then?\nI was in social work. I was about to do a master\u2019s [degree], and I took a year off to explore this interest I had in theater \u2014 \u2019cause I was doing plays, Shakespeare and all these things, with [future \u201cSCTV\u201d co-stars] Eugene Levy and Dave Thomas at McMaster University in Hamilton [Ontario]. And in the course of this year I gave myself, I got the show \u201cGodspell,\u201d and that begat other things. But I thought of myself as musical performer, an actor \u2014 maybe I\u2019d be Sinatra someday. That\u2019s where I was thinking. Not, \u201cI want to be Jerry Lewis.\u201d\nWhat are the pleasures of being in a double act with Steve Martin, and a triple act with Selena Gomez?\nWell, even when I was a cast member at \u201cSNL\u201d and having a relatively successful year, I was in two pieces a show. So I think less is more. What\u2019s great about sharing a stage or sharing a television show is that the camera is not always on you. And then when they see you, they kind of like to see you again \u2014 hopefully. I came from Second City improv; to me, the reaction was as powerful as the action. You look at a film like \u201cThe Philadelphia Story,\u201d and Cary Grant is dealing with a drunken Jimmy Stewart, just reacting. But Cary\u2019s just as funny.\nWhat\u2019s it like working with Selena, who\u2019s from a different generation?\nShe\u2019s a different generation, but she\u2019s also just a sweet, lovely person \u2014 you can be lovely at 80, lovely at 20, or the opposite. But also she\u2019s a pro, she knows her lines, she\u2019s on time. I think the thing that\u2019s been most beneficial to the success of the show is that the three of us work in a similar way \u2014 loose, fun, laughs on the set, mistakes laughed at, no tension. Because that\u2019s the only thing you can control. You don\u2019t know if the film\u2019s going to be any good, but you can control the working situation.\nYou\u2019re very physical in \u201cOnly Murders.\u201d Do you have any sort of regimen to stay in shape?\nI think a lot of that\u2019s DNA and luck. But I always have done Pilates, which is all about stretch and core.\nIs there also a psychological element to how you fly through the world?\nI think it all goes to health. I remember when I was turning 30 I decided to get into the best shape I\u2019d ever been in in my life. And I was going to the gym and working out, and two days before turning 30 I pulled my back lifting weights and could barely walk, and felt like I was 90. But I have great health; I don\u2019t get up [and] go, \u201cOh that\u2019s right, I\u2019m not spry anymore.\u201d That might affect my behavior. But I don\u2019t put an age on myself, because I don\u2019t feel restricted by age."

      "text": "How Orthodox Jewish families are finding ways to support their trans children\n- Share via\nZiva Mann remembers how joyful and smiley her daughter was as a child \u2014 the family even gave her the nickname \u201cGiggles.\u201d\n\u201cShe was just sunshine,\u201d Mann said. That changed around second grade, when her joy began to fade. \u201cShe got sadder and sadder,\u201d Mann recalled. \u201cIt was like watching someone disappear.\u201d\nMann later realized that her child\u2019s growing sadness was connected to a struggle to reckon with her gender identity.\nHer daughter came out as transgender at home in Massachusetts four years ago. \u201cMom, I\u2019m a girl,\u201d Mann remembers hearing her say. Though she was surprised by the news, she quickly came to admire her daughter\u2019s bravery.\nSince then, the family has striven to find the best ways to support Ellie within their modern Orthodox community, where tradition and strict gender roles shape daily life. They\u2019ve managed to find emotional and spiritual resources close to home at a time when transgender rights are under attack nationwide.\nRaising a trans child in Orthodox Jewish communities\nTwo of the three biggest branches of Judaism in the U.S. \u2014 Reform and Conservative \u2014 support the rights of transgender people, but it can still be challenging for trans youth to find an inclusive congregation.\nSchools in Orthodox Jewish communities are typically divided by gender, and most synagogues have separate seating sections for men and women \u2014 sometimes on different floors.\n\u201cOrthodoxy today is just binary,\u201d said Myriam Kabakov, co-founder and executive director of Eshel, an organization supporting LGBTQ+ people in Orthodox environments. \u201cYou\u2019re either male or you\u2019re female. So if a trans person is in between transitioning, very often they will be asked not to come to synagogue.\u201d\nShe said even after someone has fully transitioned, rabbis should allow them to sit where they feel comfortable. But that acceptance is not guaranteed.\nTo connect parents and trans children with inclusive synagogues, Eshel developed a program called \u201cWelcoming Shuls,\u201d where people can confide in spiritual leaders who will treat them with respect.\nAccording to Kabakov, about 300 rabbis and 160 families with trans members have joined their listings. Deslie Paneth is among them. She lives on Long Island and has traveled far to find support for Ollie, her transgender son.\n\u201cOne night, I said to my husband, \u2018I need help, I don\u2019t know how to navigate this,\u2019 \u201d Paneth said. \u201cWithout Eshel, I don\u2019t know how this would have turned out for any of us.\u201d\nBalancing tradition and change\nMann defines herself as modern Orthodox, meaning she strives to uphold Judaic law while embracing the values within her family.\n\u201cThe only time we break the rules is to save someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause a life is more important than all of the rules.\u201d\nRespecting her daughter\u2019s identity felt akin to saving her life, so Mann didn\u2019t feel the need to talk to God about it. She said who her daughter is as a person mattered more than the gender she thought she had.\nMann has heard of families with trans children who were asked to leave their synagogue, but this didn\u2019t happen to her. Before discussing Ellie\u2019s identity with other relatives, Mann reached out to her rabbi. He assured her that her daughter would be treated with dignity and respect.\n\u201cHe offered us a blessing,\u201d Mann said. \u201cThe strength, the love and the grace to parent a child who\u2019s walking a difficult path.\u201d\nFinding a place to belong\nMann feels lucky to have found support, both in religious spaces and among family members, which has helped Ellie be her joyful self again. Some Orthodox families have faced a tougher process.\nPaneth recalled her son, before starting his transition around 2017, was deeply religious and they enjoyed sitting together at synagogue.\n\u201cHe tells me still today that, especially around the holiday times, it hurts him that he can\u2019t sit next to me in temple,\u201d Paneth said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably my child that has the strongest commitment to Judaism from an emotional connection.\u201d\nA rabbi told Paneth that Ollie is welcome to come to services, but he would now be expected to sit among the men. This is part of the reason why Ollie has not returned to synagogue since his transition.\nFaith and identity at a crossroads\nOllie believes that his relationship with religion splintered as a student in an all-girls Orthodox Jewish high school. As he started raising questions about gender equality, none of the answers sufficed.\n\u201cI\u2019m still convinced that if I wasn\u2019t trans, I would still be a religious Jew,\u201d the 27-year-old said.\nHe initially told his parents he was a lesbian. But since attending a secular college, making LGBTQ+ friends and feeling trapped during the pandemic, he decided to speak with them again. \u201cIf I was going to survive this, I had to come out with my parents as trans and start medically transitioning.\u201d\nHe had top surgery in 2022 and soon after met his girlfriend at JQY, a program for Jewish LGBTQ+ teens. The couple now lives together in New York.\nOllie doesn\u2019t think of himself as Orthodox, and says he would like to find a new path toward God. Paneth understands and still includes him in the Jewish holidays. Ollie appreciates it.\nBecause he first connected to God as a girl, it doesn\u2019t feel natural to him to embrace traditions that are typical for Jewish men, like wearing a kippah.\n\u201cI don\u2019t do any of the tasks that men do religiously because I\u2019m the same person I always was,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I look different, my relationship to God didn\u2019t change.\u201d\nMaking synagogues more inclusive\nKabakov said many LGBTQ+ Jews eventually decide to leave Orthodoxy, but for those who wish to remain, Eshel and some spiritual leaders offer support.\nRabbi Mike Moskowitz, who works at an LGBTQ+ synagogue in New York, thinks of his job as helping people understand how they can be their authentic selves and still feel accepted by their religion. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Judaism is the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOrthodoxy, the people, are the problem.\u201d\nThe counseling he provides for trans children and their parents is specific to each person, but in general, he offers fresh interpretations of the Hebrew Bible.\n\u201cThose who want to be transphobic say the Bible says you can\u2019t wear misgendered clothing,\u201d Moskowitz said. \u201cI think a response is that trans folks are not wearing misgendered clothing. They\u2019re wearing gender-affirming clothing.\u201d\nHe, like Kabakov, believes there\u2019s a trend in Orthodoxy toward more inclusivity, but there\u2019s more work to do.\n\u201cDiscrimination is unholy,\u201d he said. \u201cUnity is coping through kindness and being able to replace the weight of oppression with the elevation of love.\u201d\nHern\u00e1ndez writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "\u2018Nobody Wants This\u2019? More like nobody wants you to root for love more\n- Share via\nBack in the 1920s, a comedy called \u201cAbie\u2019s Irish Rose,\u201d about a Jewish boy married to a Catholic girl and the havoc that plays among their families, ran for more than five years on Broadway in spite of terrible reviews. (\u201cPeople laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success,\u201d wrote Robert Benchley, then a Life magazine theater critic.)\nIn 1972, CBS revived this concept as \u201cBridget Loves Bernie,\u201d about a Jewish boy married to a Catholic girl, etc., etc., whose intermarriage theme occasioned some controversy, though stars David Birney and Meredith Baxter later wed in real life.\nAnd now, after a suitable cooling-down period, comes \u201cNobody Wants This,\u201d arriving Thursday on Netflix \u2014 a brave title \u2014 with Kristen Bell as the nice Gentile girl (she\u2019s not religious) and Adam Brody as the nice Jewish boy (a rabbi, yet). As in the earlier iterations, it is your job to root for them, and you will not find it hard to, so likable and attractive are they both, and so loudly does the series cry \u201crom-com!\u201d Bell, of course, is America\u2019s sweetheart with a bit of attitude, and Brody has an easy way that makes his every utterance seem arrived at in the moment in spite of the fact that he is starring in something of a contraption.\nOver lunch in East L.A., the actors discussed pairing up for a rom-com series, stepping into their respective roles and how the show portrays love at a more mature age.\nTo begin: Noah abruptly breaks it off with his fiancee, Rebecca (Emily Arlook), after he finds her wearing the engagement ring he kept in a locked drawer and hadn\u2019t actually given her yet. Joanne is in the cycle of bad dates rom-com heroines must endure before the good relationship comes along. At a party thrown by a mutual friend, they flirt and banter and, after some clearing of the decks, they get together and, beating back fearfulness, mostly stay together.\nIt\u2019s bouncy and pleasant, with likable \u2014 or eventually likable \u2014 characters, some of whom will present problems for the couple along the way. But the stones in their path are for the most part easily kicked aside, and once the relationship is established, there\u2019s no real concern \u2014 until near the end, when serious questions must be faced \u2014 that things won\u2019t work out. Noah and Joanne are unselfish people whose constitutional truthfulness robs the series of one of situation comedy\u2019s main engines \u2014 the lie \u2014 for the better. Indeed, more tension is generated by wondering whether the writing will run down predictable paths than what will become of the lovers. It does a little, but not quite as much as one might expect, which is rather refreshing.\nAs in most every romantic comedy since the world began, they are attended by quirky friends and relatives. Noah has a brother, Sasha (Timothy Simons, from \u201cVeep\u201d), a cheerful lug with little ambition, a wife, Esther (Jackie Tohn) and a daughter, Miriam (Shiloh Bearman), whose bat mitzvah will play a climactic role; Joanne has a divorced sister, Morgan (Justine Lupe, from \u201cSuccession\u201d), \u201cmy best friend and my worst enemy,\u201d with whom she affectionately bickers. Surreptitiously bonding over being the \u201closer siblings,\u201d Sasha and Morgan get to be funny without the burden of carrying the central story. I would happily watch the two of them in their own show.\n1. Timothy Simons, left, plays Noah\u2019s brother, Sasha. (Adam Rose / Netflix) 2. Justine Lupe, right, stars as Morgan, Joanne\u2019s sister. (Hopper Stone / Netflix)\nJoanne and Morgan share a popular home-recorded podcast, also called \u201cNobody Wants This,\u201d in which they talk about sex, but not, as Joanne likes to insist, only about sex \u2014 \u201cI just want them to feel empowered,\u201d she says of their listeners. \u201cIt\u2019s textbook fourth-wave feminism.\u201d They\u2019re on the verge of a deal with Spotify and making them as rich as Noah\u2019s family \u2014 though, like everyone here, they are apparently doing quite well already. (Series creator Erin Foster shares a podcast with her sister Sara, \u201cThe World\u2019s First Podcast.\u201d)\nThere are parents, naturally, whose temperaments must vary widely for maximum contrast and humor. Hers are whimsical and separated, a gay dad (Michael Hitchcock) and a mother (Stephanie Faracy) who has gone whole hog into spiritual practices and experiments. His, who live in a giant Sherman Oaks McMansion, are long-married immigrants \u2014 a father (Paul Ben-Victor) who is understanding and a mother (Tovah Feldshuh) who is not. It\u2019s she who cries \u201cshiksa!\u201d on seeing Joanne with Noah at temple. (\u201cTechnically it\u2019s a Jewish insult that means you\u2019re impure and detestable, but these days it just means that you\u2019re a hot, blond non-Jew,\u201d Noah explains. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a perfect description of me,\u201d replies Joanne.)\nAll the resistance, beyond Morgan habitually giving her sister a hard time (\u201cYou\u2019re sort of a bad person, relative to a man of God \u2026 I could see you with a cult leader.\u201d), comes from Noah\u2019s more insular world \u2014 it seems a little heavy-handed at times, but as a secular Jew married to a lapsed Catholic, I don\u2019t run in those circles. So I don\u2019t know.\n(Let me say, though, that you can\u2019t judge a shiksa by her cover. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lauren Bacall, Tina Louise, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Lisa Kudrow, Peggy Lipton \u2014 all Jewish. Also, Joanne doesn\u2019t know what \u201cshalom\u201d means? And you might like to know, because I looked it up, that rabbis, depending on the denomination, do marry outside the faith.)\nThere has always been plenty of Jewishness in screen culture, from the Marx Brothers to Mel Brooks, from Sid Caesar to \u201cSeinfeld\u201d to \u201cBroad City,\u201d \u201cBrooklyn Bridge\u201d to \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d The first talking picture, \u201cThe Jazz Singer,\u201d starred Al Jolson as a cantor\u2019s son who wanted to go pop. Yet historically it\u2019s been more often implied than specific. (I am always gratified when a bit of Yiddish drops into dialogue.) That religion, or lack of it, enters into the story in a fairly substantial way, makes \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d a member of a relatively small club, setting it apart from most romantic comedies \u2014 though of course the couple-from-different-worlds angle is a pillar of the form, a cornerstone of the culture, which in itself knows no race, creed or religion. We\u2019re suckers for that stuff. \u201cAbie\u2019s Irish Rose\u201d played 2,327 performances."

      "text": "Depressed? Sure. But \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019 brought plenty of laughs in its run\n- Share via\nFew TV births are preserved in virtual amber, but \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg can point to the exact moment his show was born, which he shared on Twitter in March: A screen capture of an email he sent in 2010 to former high school buddy and comic artist Lisa Hanawalt: \u201cHey, do you have a picture of one of your horse guys, by himself? I came up with this idea for a show I\u2019d like to pitch. Tell me what you think: BoJack the Depressed Talking Horse.\u201d\nA decade later, BoJack the depressed talking horse has hung up his hat, following six seasons, 77 episodes on Netflix, and two prime-time Emmy nominations. With him goes the legacy of one of the most unusual, insightful, adult animated TV series ever. And yes, that five-word concept Bob-Waksberg sent out in an email described the show to a T.\n\u201cIt was a deep look at one man/horse\u2019s journey through his depression, the people around him, his loved ones and family,\u201d says executive producer and \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d actor Aaron Paul, who voiced multiple characters, including Todd Chavez. \u201cWe watched this horse/man trying to navigate his way through life, and live side-by-side with his depression.\u201d\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1eJMig5Ik4\nHorses and animation aside, \u201cBoJack\u201d was never meant for the younger set \u2014 nor was it entirely about a depressed equine/man. (In BoJack\u2019s universe, no one found it unusual that humans and animal-human hybrids existed side-by-side.)\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking to do another cartoon show,\u201d says Bob-Waksberg. \u201cI thought about what I have not seen a ton of, and at the time Netflix was a relatively new platform and what they were doing with their shows were these highly serialized stories, which I hadn\u2019t seen much in western adult animation.\u201d\n\u201cRaphael always wanted to take the show into a deep place and examine things that are not always looked at in a comedic animation series,\u201d says Alison Brie, who voiced BoJack\u2019s best friend Diane. \u201cThe way he went into depression, alcoholism, dementia, regret, life in Hollywood was astounding and exciting.\u201d\nGetting \u201cBoJack\u201d from concept to air was far from an overnight endeavor. Tornante Television\u2019s Steve Cohen and Noel Bright, who served as executive producers, saw a spark in Bob-Waksberg, a relatively untried East Coast transplant with no animation experience, and invited him in for meetings to discuss ideas.\nNetflix\u2019s \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019 binge-worthy? Beyond snaring the likes of Will Arnett, Aaron Paul and Amy Sedaris, there isn\u2019t much to graze on in this adult-oriented comedy available Friday.\n\u201cToward the end of this meeting he pitched \u2014 well, blurted out, to call it a pitch is an overstatement,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cWhat was striking about it was, \u2018What do you do when you don\u2019t have happiness?\u2019 That notion left us wanting more.\u201d\nThus, the crew assembled: Bob-Waksberg shares a manager with Will Arnett, who signed on to executive produce and voice BoJack, and then Paul came on board. Bright says they attracted the attention of Netflix\u2019s director of original series, Blair Fetter (who hadn\u2019t necessarily been looking for animation, but was convinced after another charismatic pitch by Bob-Waksberg). Then Bob-Waksberg had to persuade Hanawalt to come on board as the production designer/producer.\nEnsuring Hanawalt would sign on was a key call: Her drawings have a warm, hand-drawn quality (though the show\u2019s animation was created on computers), watercolor shades, eye-popping colors and dozens of tiny details that gave texture and depth to her \u201cBoJack\u201d creations. (Prior to \u201cBoJack,\u201d she\u2019d published one book of her work, \u201cI Want You\u201d; during the show\u2019s run, she went on to create the recently renewed Netflix series \u201cTuca & Bertie.\u201d)\nTrailer for \u201cBojack Horseman\u201d Season 6 on Netflix.\n\u201cI prefer animation that shows the human hand a little bit more,\u201d she writes in an email. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the budget for hand-drawn animation, but little details helped to give the designs and backgrounds more character.\u201d\nFinally, Mike Hollingsworth joined the team as supervising director and \u201canimation expert,\u201d says Bob-Waksberg. \u201cHe brought a lot of the silliness to the show, at least in the beginning \u2014 he\u2019s a real cartoon guy in ways Lisa and I were not. To me, a lot of the magic of the show is the three-headed monster of me, Lisa and Mike collaboratively.\u201d\nStill, the show was never just colorful artwork and scripts that tackled subjects like suicide, drug abuse and #MeToo moments, says Arnett. \u201cIf you\u2019d made the show just overtly about BoJack being depressed and alcoholic, it might not be as funny \u2014 and people might not be inclined to tune in. It\u2019s got a little bit of everything. It\u2019s a funny show about a guy struggling with addiction, and that\u2019s OK to laugh about.\u201d\nFive seasoned entertainment journalists predict the shows and performances the Television Academy will honor with Emmys; do you agree with their picks?\n\u201cAll the story lines were so human and heartfelt and real,\u201d says Amy Sedaris, who voiced characters including Princess Carolyn. \u201cEverybody could relate to it in so many ways.\u201d\nIn the end, Netflix called a halt to \u201cBoJack\u201d and Bob-Waksberg went on to do Amazon\u2019s animated \u201cUndone.\u201d And the no-longer-rookie animation show creator says he\u2019s happy as long as he can keep doing the unexpected.\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 or \u2018Star Wars,\u2019\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cI want to burn up any cachet I have by doing small, weird and niche stuff. Hopefully, I have room to do that before no one wants to work with me again.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nInterviewing Larry David at his Santa Monica production offices comes with photographic documentation of the entrance and a note to pull in and park as straight as possible in order to be courteous to the building\u2019s other residents.\nBut when I arrived on a recent Wednesday morning, someone had taken up two spots.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s Larry,\u201d laughs Laura Streicher, co-executive producer of creator and star David\u2019s famously cringe-inducing chronicle of social transgression, \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a pig parker.\u201d\nThe phrase is one of many that have entered the vernacular from the HBO comedy series, which first premiered in 2000, restarted after a six-year gap in 2017 and will (supposedly) conclude with its forthcoming 12th season, premiering Feb. 4. Originating in Season 8, \u201cpig parker\u201d means someone who is self-absorbed and greedy enough not to take the time to park between the lines, an act that will inevitably lead to utter bedlam and the destruction of a democratic state.\nWe gathered together the TV experts at The Times to preview our most anticipated new and returning TV shows of 2024. Here are 14 to keep an eye out for.\nAlthough \u201cCurb\u201d is largely improvised, there is an outline for each episode and a story arc for the season. Some of the terms made famous by the show stemmed from conversations, ideas or situations that happened decades ago, even before David and Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s legendary NBC sitcom, \u201cSeinfeld.\u2019\u2019 Others, like the titular euphemism of Season 9\u2019s \u201cA Disturbance in the Kitchen,\u201d derive from more recent events \u2014 in this case, what a real-life waiter told David to explain why his meal was delayed. (In the episode, David\u2019s character decides to investigate the situation and gets into a fight with the chef.)\nWhatever their provenance, all usually allow David\u2019s alter ego to serve as a cathartic Everyman for both the real David and those watching at home: He is a pretense-free embodiment of everything that members of polite society wish they could say but don\u2019t. Then again, for most of us, fighting in a restaurant, blowing up a business deal over a broken toilet seat, talking during a prayer service or going to all-out war with a coffee shop owner or another patient in the doctor\u2019s waiting room would mean shame, social ostracism, possibly jail. On \u201cCurb,\u201d it\u2019s simply par for the course.\nThe language of the series has even bled into David\u2019s personal life, as it\u2018s become increasingly difficult to separate the man behind \u201cCurb\u201d from his character on it. (David has not necessarily discouraged this conflation; he once told a journalist during a panel at the Television Critics Assn. press tour that \u201cTV Larry is just a quarter of an inch away from real Larry. Real Larry plays TV Larry.\u201d)\n\u201cI used to fight with people. I\u2019d ask someone the time and they\u2019d go \u2018I dunno.\u2019 And I\u2019d go \u2018It\u2019s just the time!\u2019 I can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n\u2014 Larry David\n\u201cAs the show got more popular, it\u2019s given me a little more liberty to behave in the way that the character behaves, which is the way I\u2019d like to behave,\u201d David says. \u201cAt a dinner party now, I\u2019ll always be the first to leave. And people just expect it.\u201d\nThere is a downside, though.\n\u201cI can\u2019t fight with people anymore,\u201d David laments. \u201cI used to fight with people. I\u2019d ask someone the time and they\u2019d go \u2018I dunno.\u2019 And I\u2019d go \u2018It\u2019s just the time!\u2019 I can\u2019t do that anymore. I can\u2019t have any confrontations because I\u2019ll be filmed. And I\u2019ll be on the internet. So I have to be on my best behavior when I\u2019m out amongst them.\u201d\nLarry David aficionado Adam Papagan takes The Times on his \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d tour, which doubles as a love letter to low-key Westside establishments.\nNowadays, David usually takes notes on his phone because it\u2019s more inconspicuous than a notepad \u2014 and because he says he was \u201cbereft\u201d when he lost a pocket journal of ideas 20 years ago (imagine if that wound up on EBay). Ideas then go into what series executive producer and showrunner Jeff Schaffer dubs the \u201cGoogle search\u201d: A desk drawer in David\u2019s office that\u2019s filled with spiral notebooks brimming with hand-written transcriptions of these observations.\nIt\u2019s unlikely any of these musings or encounters will stop when \u201cCurb\u201d ends, which David insists is happening even if fans are dubious of a creator who already ended the series\u2019 fifth season (in 2005) with an episode titled \u201cThe End\u201d and almost ended last season with his character dying.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like [Larry\u2019s] done having spirited conversations with the populace of the Westside of Los Angeles,\u201d says Schaffer.\nBefore the sun sets on \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d one last time, David, Schaffer and some of the series\u2019 most prominent cast members shared the backstories behind a handful of \u201cCurb\u2019s\u201d greatest moments.\nPretty, pretty, pretty good\nOf all the catchphrases associated with \u201cCurb,\u201d David\u2019s drawn-out refrain that things are \u201cpretty, pretty, pretty good\u201d when they most definitely not has become the show\u2019s de facto tagline. It\u2019s first used in the series\u2019 third episode as a form of shorthand, relating information to one character that\u2019s the opposite of what the audience already knows: Here, Larry ponders how, or if, to tell his then-wife Cheryl (Cheryl Hines) that his quest to get driving directions didn\u2019t go swimmingly. It\u2019s also been used on the show as a stall tactic or avoidance strategy during other encounters and conversations Larry does not want to have.\nThe bit began in David\u2019s days as a stand-up in the 1980s, when he\u2019d joke that you could never really tell your parents how you feel: \u201cYou can be on the verge of suicide with your head in the oven and [they\u2019d say] \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m good. I\u2019m doing good.\u2019\u201d\nBut the phrase would be nothing without its setup.\nHines trained at improv theater the Groundlings. She says that \u201cone of the ideas behind their teaching of improv is to not ask questions in an improv. But in \u2018Curb,\u2019 I have to.\u201d For the first three seasons of the show, she never even got an outline of the script.\n\u201cI never know what they\u2019re shooting in other scenes,\u201d she explains. \u201cA lot of the time, I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s been shot or what\u2019s been said. By the time he tells me what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s bad. So my only reaction is, \u2018What are you saying? Why did you do that? Why would you do that?\u2019\u201d\nBeloved Aunt\nWhen Cheryl and her family mourn a relative in Season 1, Larry offers to help by writing the obituary \u2014 but submits it with an unfortunate typo that turns the word \u201caunt\u201d into a similarly spelled vulgarity most often directed at women.\nDavid says this story line came from an actual typo a New York Times reporter told him about that, luckily, did not make it into print.\nIt\u2019s also one of the few times the show has made Larry\u2019s infraction accidental.\nDavid jokes that \u201cmy character is malleable.\u201d\nSometimes, Schaffer explains, we\u2019ll get \u201csharp-as-a-tack Larry, who\u2019s calling somebody on something. Or, if the scene calls for it, slightly oblivious Larry who\u2019s gonna keep pounding and not knowing he\u2019s stepping in it further.\u201d\nRobert B. Weide, who was \u201cCurb\u2019s\u201d principal director and an executive producer on its first five seasons and still directs episodes of the show, admits that he will \u201coccasionally give somebody a line if I thought it was funnier.\u201d While directing this episode, he gave Paul Dooley, who played Cheryl\u2019s father, the line \u201cI\u2019m just glad you weren\u2019t in charge of the headstone.\u201d\nLarry trips Shaq\n\u201cCurb\u2019s\u201d knack for showing how easily an innocent interaction can devolve into mob rule is epitomized by the Season 2 episode \u201cShaq.\u201d There, Larry and his best friend Richard Lewis (played by David\u2019s actual childhood friend, comedian Richard Lewis) have floor seats at a Los Angeles Lakers game. Things are going fine until Larry stretches out his long legs and accidentally trips, and injures, star player Shaquille O\u2019Neal. He\u2019s subsequently booed out of the stadium.\n\u201cThe only impetus was that I have sat on the floor and I have stuck my legs out and I thought, \u2018Oh, this would be funny if one of them tripped on my legs,\u2019\u201d David says plainly of the episode\u2019s conception.\nStunt performer Eric Mansker officially took the fall for O\u2019Neal and director Dean Parisot filmed that moment with just background performers. (Weide says it\u2019s Mansker we see in the overhead shot but that O\u2019Neal took a less severe fall onto mattresses so as to better sell it.) Other aspects of the episode were shot at what was then called the Staples Center with a crowd watching.\n\u201cI knew he was going to be tripped but I didn\u2019t expect the crowd to start booing,\u201d Lewis recalls. \u201cSome of the people that were sitting very far away, they might not have seen the cameras, but they would have recognized us.\u201d\nIt\u2019s \u201can example of not knowing what\u2019s real,\u201d he adds. \u201cAm I just being me or am I acting?\u201d\nIn this case, he says both the real and the fictitious Richard Lewis wanted to get outta Dodge: He remembers walking up the flight of stairs to get out of the arena with his jacket over his face.\nSusie\u2019s standoff\nSusie Essman started on \u201cCurb\u201d as a supporting player, appearing in the first season as the wife of Larry\u2019s manager (and frequent partner in shenanigans) Jeff Greene (Jeff Garlin). But she really came into her own as Larry\u2019s foul-mouthed and flamboyantly dressed nemesis in the Season 2 episode, \u201cThe Doll.\u201d\nInspired by David\u2019s own desire to give one of his daughter\u2019s dolls a haircut, the episode features Larry and Jeff stealing a doll from Jeff and Susie\u2019s daughter to make amends for another child\u2019s toy receiving a new \u2019do. It fails miserably and, aided by a perfectly cued score from music editor Steve Rasch, a western-style standoff ensues.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when that was established, that Jeff and Larry would live in fear of Susie,\u201d Essman recalls.\n\u201cI never try to top Susie Essman. I just have to live and breathe.\u201d\n\u2014 Jeff Garlin\nThat Susie stays married to Jeff despite a separation and his continued philandering is perfect, says showrunner Schaffer, because her presence feels organic to the story. (Later in the series, Susie tells Jeff that, if they were to split up, there\u2019s no way she\u2019d give him a \u201cnice divorce.\u201d)\n\u201cIf they\u2019re gonna be engaged in skullduggery, you need someone that they\u2019ve got to skulk around,\u201d Schaffer says. \u201cAnd that person can\u2019t be living now in a townhouse in Venice.\u201d\nGarlin, whose comedy background includes time at Chicago\u2019s the Second City improv house, says, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with comedic actors before, who liked doing \u2018a top.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cA top is where the scene\u2019s over, you\u2019ve said your line, and they want to talk when you\u2019re done,\u201d Garlin explains. \u201cI never try to top Susie Essman. I just have to live and breathe.\u201d\nEssman loses her voice on days where she has to scream in a scene.\n\u201cThat said, I go home that night and I sleep really, really well because I\u2019m so relaxed,\u201d she admits.\n\u2018Get in that a\u2014\u2019\nOne of the few people who can impart life lessons onto Larry is J.B. Smoove\u2019s Leon Black. Appearing in \u201cCurb\u2019s\u201d sixth season when Larry and Cheryl take in his sister Loretta (Vivica A. Fox) and her family after Hurricane Edna and then never leaving, Leon will go along with a lot of Larry\u2019s schemes because he also doesn\u2019t suffer fools.\nIn the sixth season\u2019s fourth episode, \u201cThe Lefty Call,\u201d Leon advises Larry that the only way to stand up to a bully is to \u201cget in that a\u2014.\u201d (In other words, stand up for yourself.) And as with much of the magic of \u201cCurb\u2019s\u201d improvisational style, the scene reflects David and his character\u2019s teachable moment simultaneously.\n\u201cThat was the first thing we ever did together and Larry had never heard the term before,\u201d Smoove says. \u201cHe was so perplexed as to what \u2018get in that a\u2014\u2019 meant \u2026 So it really became a lesson [for him] while we were doing the scene. There have got to be five versions of that scene, easily \u2026 One involved lighter fluid and a cigarette lighter \u2026 I called it an \u2018a\u2014 arsonist.\u2019\u201d\nAnonymous Donor\nWhat\u2019s more obnoxious than someone who wants a plaque for being a good Samaritan? The people who say they don\u2019t want the recognition but also tell everyone that they\u2019re the so-called \u201canonymous\u201d donor. Not surprisingly, David knows someone who did this. Also not surprisingly, this ate at him enough that he put it into the show. So David\u2019s friend and frequent \u201cCurb\u201d guest star Ted Danson returned to play a heightened version of himself as the titular \u201cAnonymous Donor\u201d during the show\u2019s sixth season.\nSchaffer sees the episode less as David passive-aggressively acting out a grudge fantasy than him being \u201ca defender for social justice.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also one of many episodes that winks at our culture\u2019s obsession with celebrity: Two men who are household names because of their television successes, but with vastly different reputations, go to war over who actually is the better person.\n\u201cMy reputation is being nice,\u201d Danson concedes. \u201cSo you can play that up and scrape away the fact that, actually, it\u2019s false in many ways and irritating to Larry. Or Larry can be obnoxious in his truth-telling \u2026 about things that don\u2019t really need to be raised to that level of intensity.\u201d\nPlus, Danson says, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t allow a character on TV to be that obnoxious if you did not know that he was actually a kind, funny, sweet man at heart.\u201d\nOne thing that is hard for Danson about the show? Because of \u201cCurb,\u201d people believed he divorced his wife and sometimes \u201cCurb\u201d co-star Mary Steenburgen. (On the series, he is now, appropriately enough, dating Larry\u2019s ex-wife, Cheryl.)\n\u201cIt was hard even in make-believe-land to be separated and divorced from my wife,\u201d he says.\nDanny Duberstein\n\u201cCurb\u2019s\u201d knack for playing on the meta was in full gear during its seventh season. It gave the fan community what it wanted \u2014 a reunion with the cast of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d \u2014 while also mocking our need for it with David\u2019s unavoidable self-sabotaging.\nBut it wasn\u2019t just David who poked fun at his foibles. \u201cSeinfeld\u201d co-star Michael Richards acknowledges his real-life racist rant at the Laugh Factory in 2006 when, in the series, he sees Leon at his dressing room door. As a favor to Larry, Leon has disguised himself as \u201cDanny Duberstein,\u201d a certified public accountant who was adopted into a Jewish family and survived a diagnosis of (fictitious except for the show) Groat\u2019s disease.\nLeon, clearly, has not done any reading on these topics. And when Larry is late, he\u2019s left alone with Richards to convince him otherwise.\n\u201cLeon is now a character within a character, which is even another level to what Leon can bring to this scene,\u201d Smoove says. \u201cI like that, even as Leon\u2019s supposedly being Danny Duberstein, I\u2019m still selling something to Michael Richards.\u201d\nPalestinian Chicken\nAs with \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cCurb\u201d is a Jewish show simply by the fact that its lead is Jewish. And the series has never shied away from hot-button or taboo topics across cultures: In the ninth season, a fatwa is issued against Larry; in the 10th, which aired in 2020, he dons a red MAGA hat to keep people away from him; last season, he helped himself to a pair of shoes worn by a Holocaust victim when his were ruined.\nIn one of its most famous episodes, the Season 8 entry \u201cPalestinian Chicken,\u201d \u201cCurb\u201d took on one of the thorniest subjects of all when Larry falls in love with the delicious chicken at a restaurant run by an antisemitic family \u2014 and attempts to date one of its employees, played by Anne Bedian.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s hit the Jew card,\u2019\u201d David explains, adding that \u201cCurb\u201d is about putting him \u201cany place where someone with a 12-year-old mentality should not be.\u201d To wit, it\u2019s in this episode that Larry\u2019s behavior inspires Jeff to coin the term \u201csocial assassin.\u201d\nClean up your mess\nAlthough it\u2019s set in the world of one-percenters on L.A.\u2019s Westside, \u201cCurb\u201d is frequently an attack on elitism. In the Season 11 episode \u201cThe Watermelon,\u201d Kaley Cuoco guest stars as Heidi, Larry\u2019s optometrist, who cannot be bothered to clean up the Pirate\u2019s Booty she drops on the floor. This is a sticking point not just for Larry but for his friend Freddy (Vince Vaughn), who is dating Heidi but cannot let this transgression slide.\n\u201cSometimes the more specific you are with a real area and culture, the truth is that it\u2019s more universal,\u201d says Vaughn, whose character is the half-brother of Marty Funkhouser, played by the late Bob Einstein. He adds that what entertains the audience is how certain people and characters react to these situations: \u201cWhether you\u2019re reading a book or watching a movie or a show, the more rich and specific a world is that you step into, it\u2019s aesthetically more interesting.\u201d"
