      "text": "This article is produced and financed by NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology - read more\nCooking fumes can create respiratory problems for chefs\nCooks live less long on average than people in most other occupational groups. Changes in their working environment could result in better health for many.\nChefs who spend a lot of time inhaling cooking fumes are at increased risk of respiratory problems, new research from NTNU suggests.\nChefs are among the occupational groups in Norway with the lowest life expectancy.\nThe average life expectancy for people in this profession has risen to around 76 years the past few years, but it remains among the most vulnerable occupations.\nThis may be due to several factors, including lifestyle.\nA shorter life expectancy for chefs is not limited to Norway. Several European studies document increased mortality among chefs.\n\u201cIn the field of occupational medicine, it\u2019s not enough just to look at occupational groups as a whole. One useful method may be to look at individuals within the same occupation who are subjected to different types of exposure,\u201d says Sindre Rabben Svedahl, a doctor in the Occupational Medicine centre at St. Olavs Hospital.\nSvedahl recently completed his doctoral thesis on the working environment and health of cooks.\n\u201cHow much time do you spend frying foods?\u201d\nSome chefs deal mostly with purchasing or have more administrative roles, so they are not necessarily exposed to as many cooking fumes.\nIn this survey, nearly 900 chefs responded to a questionnaire about their work.\n\u201cOne of the questions was \u201cHow much of your working day consists of cooking on a flat top griddle, grill or frying pan?\u201d says Svedahl.\nThe research team hoped to identify any relationship between cooks who spent a lot of their working day frying foods, and chefs who had other roles.\nThey found a connection between exposure to cooking fumes and a form of bronchitis.\nRespiratory problems more common\nThe results are consistent with other research in the field. Earlier studies also suggest that chefs are plagued more by respiratory issues than most people.\nThese include disorders like asthma, emphysema and rhinitis, which is a chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa.\nAs part of the NTNU studies, 24 volunteers were briefly exposed to cooking fumes. This is a small sample number and the exposure was short, so the experimental results are far from definitive.\nHowever, they showed that the respiratory tract has a tendency to respond even to this modest exposure.\nThe cooking profession has a relatively high dropout rate, but this is unrelated to respiratory problems.\nThe NTNU studies show that unfavourable working hours are the most common reason that chefs quit, while muscle and skeletal complaints are the most common medical cause.\nMany cooks choose to hold out despite experiencing respiratory issues at work and the possible health consequences they can lead to in the long term.\nMaybe cleaner air just hasn\u2019t been a priority.\nCalling for common industry regs\nMinimizing cooking fume exposure as much as possible can prevent respiratory problems for chefs.\nOne problem is that there are no regulations that specifically address the situation cooks face.\n\u201cThere are some general rules related to particulate matter in the air, but none specific to the cooks\u2019 working environment,\u201d says Svedahl.\nBut different particles are different. Some may not affect one\u2019s health in the least. Cooking fumes include fat and fatty acids droplets that are so small that they can be inhaled deep into the lungs.\nSeveral carcinogens have been identified in the fumes.\nIn a competitive industry, where margins are often small, employers don\u2019t feel they can afford to invest in the necessary technology to reduce chefs\u2019 exposure to fumes \u2013 at least not as long as competitors will be saving money by not doing it.\n\u201cThe solution might be to establish regulations for the entire industry,\u201d says Svedahl.\nSeveral years follow\u2013up\n\u201cAs part of Svedahl\u2019s PhD project, we\u2019ve also started a \u2018prospective cohort\u2019 at the Occupational Medicine centre. Starting in 2010 and continuing for five years, we interviewed as many cook apprentices from Tr\u00f8ndelag and M\u00f8re og Romsdal counties as we could get our hands on about their working environment and health,\u201d says consultant Bj\u00f8rn Hilt at St. Olavs Hospital.\nHilt is also an adjunct professor at NTNU and has been one of Svedahl\u2019s advisors.\n\u201cOur intent is to follow them in their cooking career and track the conditions in their working environment over several years. A prospective cohort is relatively rare in the working environment context. We have high expectations for what we\u2019ll learn over the years. Then we\u2019ll know what individual cooks have to deal with and can try to correlate the working conditions with various health conditions that arise later,\u201d says Hilt.\nResearchers have carried out the work with the support of NHO\u2019s Working Environment Fund.\nImportant for support\n\u201cThe working environment and health of cooks is a topic we\u2019ve been working on for many years. At first only at the St. Olavs Occupational Health centre, but later also in collaboration with the Department of Industrial Economics and Technology Management (I\u00d8T),\u201d says Kristin V. Hirsch Svendsen, a professor at NTNU\u2019s I\u00d8T. She was Svedahl\u2019s other advisor.\nThis collaborative effort has so far generated four master\u2019s projects and two doctoral theses since 2001. Ann Kristin Sjaastad defended her dissertation on what chefs are exposed to in 2010 at I\u00d8T.\nShe investigated which substances are found in cooking fumes.\n\u201cThe fact that we can now show that this exposure results in poorer lung health is important in order to get support for implementing measures in the industry,\u201d says Professor Svendsen.\nCreating a healthy working environment in professional kitchens is important and can help prevent both illness and premature death, the research group concluded.\n----------"

      "text": "You are more exposed to PM2.5 cooking an omelette in your kitchen than standing on an average London roadside, a study has claimed.\nVentilation firm Zehnder UK asked five volunteers to place an indoor air quality monitor inside their home for five days, writing down their activities as well as potential variables such as whether their window was open or not.\nOne volunteer\u2019s home recorded consistently low levels of PM2.5 throughout the five days but experienced a peak of 68\u00c2\u00b5g/m\u00c2\u00b3 when they cooked an omelette and used a grill.\nThis is almost three times the average level of 23\u00c2\u00b5g/m\u00c2\u00b3 recorded in London by the roadside.\nOne volunteer was a smoker who was joined by friends to smoke throughout an evening. Over a period of two hours, the PM2.5 level jumped from a safe level of 1.3\u00c2\u00b5g/m\u00c2\u00b3 to 839\u00c2\u00b5g/m\u00c2\u00b3.\nA dangerous level of PM2.5 is considered to be anything over 76\u00c2\u00b5g/m\u00c2\u00b3.\nAnother volunteer recorded a large spike of 85 \u00c2\u00b5g/m\u00c2\u00b3 at around 7am when his wife was using hairspray as she got ready for work.\nRupert Kazlauciunas, technical product manager at Zehnder UK said indoor air quality is \u2018dangerously overlooked\u2019.\n\u2018We spend as much as 90% of our time indoors \u2014 yet mention air quality and our thoughts immediately turn to large lorries pumping fumes, cars clogging our roads or factories belching out smoke,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018The chemicals and particles we breathe in our homes and workplaces actually pose a far more dangerous threat to our health than most people realise.\n\u2018Smoking, perhaps, is not a huge surprise, but cooking, using cosmetics and even just having pets or vacuuming our carpets can raise dust particles to harmful levels.\u2019\nPhoto Credit \u2013 PixabayThe dangers of indoor air pollution have been highlighted in several recent studies.\nGlobal Action Plan asked the National Air Quality Testing Services (NAQTS) to conduct four experiments with four families in different UK locations in April and May 2019.\nEach study monitored the level of ultrafine air pollution particles over a 24-hour period inside and outside the four families\u2019 properties, which found that ultrafine particle pollution levels were on average 3.5 times higher inside than outside, peaking at 560 times outdoor air pollution.\nResearchers said this is due to a combination of indoor activities such as cooking or burning wood alongside outdoor pollution from transport, which travels inside, creating a build-up of pollution inside the home, with pollution peaks taking longer than outdoors to disperse.\nUltrafine particles have the potential to have greater health impacts than PM10 or PM2.5 pollutants because they are smaller and evidence suggests they can be more easily absorbed into the body.\nAnother study said UK households are experiencing dangerous levels of indoor air pollution due to \u2018significant\u2019 levels of formaldehyde, a human carcinogen that is found in adhesives in wood products such as MDF, carpets, furniture, paints and varnishes."
