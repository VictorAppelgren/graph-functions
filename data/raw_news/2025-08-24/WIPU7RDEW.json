  "description": "CarFest returns for the 14th and final time to Laverstoke Park Farm in Overton, Hampshire.",
  "content": "CarFest has returned for the 14th and final time to Laverstoke Park Farm in Overton, with next year's festival moving to Silverstone in Northamptonshire. The festival, founded by radio presenter Chris Evans in 2012, was met with pushback from residents in its first year. Campaigners even challenged, external the festival's license, but lost. But now, more than a decade since the event's live music and vintage cars first arrived next door, how do locals feel about it leaving?\n\nTrudy Knapman said she thought some people in the village would miss the festival, which provided \"excitement, something to do\". \"If you live in London you have lot's to do but this is one thing that does happen here,\" she said.\n\nBarista Sharon Driver said the cafe she worked at would lose some customers due to the move. She said: \"I think it will affect sales. Over the weekend, its a funny thing, we can be busy in the morning but in the afternoon people are at the festival so it changes.\" \"But we will miss the different people coming in.\"\n\nRebecca King said she was not bothered by the move, but some young people might be. \"Some people my age do go. I personally don't but a lot of people love it for the music,\" she said. \"Young people might miss it, but there's plenty of other festivals around.\"\n\nKaren Watts lives in Overton and is a borough councillor for Basingstoke and Dean. She said the event met some opposition from residents before it came to the village, but \"on the whole\" people came to love it. \"People had apprehension about it, about the traffic and what it would mean for the village,\" she said. \"I think generally that's changed and a lot of residents I know do go to the festival and I think people are sad to see it go.\"\n\nAnne said she was pleased to see the festival move away to Silverstone. She said: \"The village is a bit dead when CarFest is around and there are lots of cars zooming past. \"I've never been and I'm quite happy about it actually.\"\n\nBuilder Andy Wright said he though people from Overton would still go to CarFest in Silverstone. He said: \"I think it's a shame - the period leading up to it everyone gets excited about it. \"I'm sure it will be missed but I'm sure there'll be people from Overton who will be making their way to Silverstone now.\"",
