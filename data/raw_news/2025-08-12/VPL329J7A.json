  "title": "AI Startup Perplexity Makes Bold $34.5 Billion Bid for Google's Chrome Browser",
  "description": "The bid for Chrome is far above Perplexity's own valuation.",
  "content": "The bid for Chrome is far above Perplexity\u2019s own valuation.\n\nRun by Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity is no stranger to headline-grabbing offers: it made a similar one for TikTok US in January, offering to merge with the popular short-video app to resolve U.S. concerns about TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership. OpenAI, Yahoo and private-equity firm Apollo Global Management have also expressed interest in Chrome as regulatory pressure threatens Google\u2019s grip on the industry. Google did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The company has not offered Chrome for sale and plans to appeal a U.S. court ruling last year that found it held an unlawful monopoly in online search. The Justice Department has sought a Chrome divestiture as part of the case\u2019s remedies.\n\nPerplexity did not disclose on Tuesday how it plans to fund the offer. The three-year-old company has raised around $1 billion in funding so far from investors including Nvidia and Japan\u2019s SoftBank. It was last valued at $14 billion. Multiple funds have offered to finance the deal in full, Perplexity said, without naming the funds. Alphabet\u2019s shares were up 1.6 percent in afternoon trading. As a new generation of users turns to chatbots such as ChatGPT and Perplexity for answers, web browsers are regaining prominence as vital gateways to search traffic and prized user data, making them central to Big Tech\u2019s AI ambitions.\n\nPerplexity already has an AI browser, Comet, that can perform certain tasks on a user\u2019s behalf and buying Chrome would allow it to tap the browser\u2019s more than three billion users, giving it the heft to better compete with bigger rivals such as OpenAI. The ChatGPT parent is also working on its own AI browser. Perplexity\u2019s bid pledges to keep the underlying browser code called Chromium open source, invest $3 billion over two years and make no changes to Chrome\u2019s default search engine, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters. The company said the offer, with no equity component, would preserve user choice and ease future competition concerns.\n\nAnalysts have said Google would be unlikely to sell Chrome and would likely engage in a long legal fight to prevent that outcome, given it is crucial to the company\u2019s AI push as it rolls out features including AI-generated search summaries, known as Overviews, to help defend its search market share. A federal judge, Amit Mehta, is expected to issue a ruling on remedies in the Google search antitrust case sometime this month. \u201cJudge Mehta is a pretty orthodox guy. It\u2019s very possible that he would hold off on requiring a sale until the appeals process is worked out and that could be a very lengthy period of time,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, professor at University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.\n\n\u201cIt would go to the DC Circuit, which is skeptical of forced divestitures, and it\u2019s possible it would even go to the Supreme Court after that. So that process could run out for a couple of years.\u201d Perplexity\u2019s bid is also below the at least $50 billion value that rival search engine DuckDuckGo\u2019s CEO, Gabriel Weinberg, suggested Chrome may command if Google was forced to sell it.
