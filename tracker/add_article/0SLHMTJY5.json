The statement affirms U.S. recognition of Venezuela’s 2015 National Assembly as the legitimate government and urges the court to give its views respectful consideration. The filing does not address the legal merits of the bonds but signals U.S. support for the opposition’s position. Gold Reserve’s bid to acquire PDVH shares remains subject to court approval and regulatory clearance.",
