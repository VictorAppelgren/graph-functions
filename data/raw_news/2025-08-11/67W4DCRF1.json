  "description": "Two proposed ballot measure in Massachusetts would repeal the state's 2016 legalization of recreational marijuana sales if approved by voters in next year's election.",
  "content": "Two proposed ballot measure in Massachusetts would end legal sales of recreational marijuana, despite the widespread popularity of regulated adult-use cannabis in the Bay State. If passed, the ballot measures would prohibit sales of recreational weed in Massachusetts while retaining regulated sales of medical cannabis.\n\nThe two similar ballot proposal were filed by Caroline Cunningham, who campaigned against a proposal to legalize psychedelics in Massachusetts, according to a from online cannabis news outlet Marijuana Moment. The psychedelics was opposed by nearly 57% of voters in the November general election last year.\n\nProposals Outlaw Weed Sales, But Not Possession Of Small Amounts Of Pot\n\nUnder both proposed ballot measures, titled \u201cAn Act to Restore A Sensible Marijuana Policy,\u201d the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana including up to five grams of cannabis concentrates would continue to be legal for adults aged 21 and older. Adults would also be permitted to gift cannabis to other adults without compensation. Possession of between one ounce and two ounces of weed would be decriminalized, although offenders would be subject to civil fines of up to $100 for the infraction.\n\nThe measures would repeal sections of Massachusetts\u2019 cannabis legalization law, which was approved by nearly 54% of voters in 2016, that authorize recreational cannabis retailers. The proposals would also repeal access to regulated cannabis products by adults and provisions that legalize the home cultivation of marijuana.\n\nThe two proposed ballot measures differ only slightly, with one setting potency limits on medical cannabis. If that version is approved, state regulators would be required to limit the potency of marijuana flower to 30% THC, while cannabis concentrates would be capped at 60%. Concentrates with more than 5mg THC per metered dose would also be banned. Concentrate products that \u201cfail to clearly provide metered, or otherwise measured, standard delivered servings\u201d of 5 mg THC would also be prohibited, as would products that contain more than 20 5mg doses.\n\nMassachusetts Recriminalization Initiatives Face Hurdles To Appear On Ballot\n\nThe two ballot proposals face a long road to approval in next year\u2019s general election. The petitions for the initiative must first pass muster with the state attorney general\u2019s office to ensure they meet constitutional requirements, with a decision due on September 3.\n\nIf the initiative petitions are approved, backers would be required to gather at least 75,574 signatures from registered voters to file with the Secretary of the Commonwealth by December 3, according to a from the Telegram & Gazette.\n\nIf enough verified signatures are submitted, the proposals will be sent to the Massachusetts state legislature for consideration. If the legislature declines to do approve the initiatives, the supporters of the proposal would be given until July 1, 2026, to collect an additional 12,429 signatures to place the proposal on the ballot for next year\u2019s general election. The initiatives would then need the approval of a majority of voters to become law.\n\nThe proposed ballot measures come as the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission struggles to effectively regulate that state\u2019s cannabis industry and protect public health. Just last week, the agency issued a public health and safety announcing that more than 500 different products that had already entered the market were contaminated or potentially contaminated with mold or yeast.\n\nSteve Reilly, head of government relations at Massachusetts-based licensed cannabis multistate operator Insa, says that problems with the state\u2019s cannabis regulator are not sufficient grounds to scrap recreational cannabis legalization.\n\n\u201cThe voters in Massachusetts have already made their decision clear when choosing to legalize adult-use cannabis,\u201d Reilly writes in an emailed statement. \u201cIt is important not to conflate the shortcomings of the Cannabis Control Commission with the fundamental merits of the program itself. The existence of regulatory challenges does not mean the program is flawed in principle; it means oversight must improve.\n\n\u201cThe ballot questions propose to effectively legalize cannabis through illegal operators while shutting down the legal framework in place. Elected representatives on Beacon Hill are actively working to address industry-related issues and strengthen the system,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe solution is not to abandon a voter-approved program simply because regulators have fallen short, it is to ensure that those tasked with oversight are held accountable and that reforms are implemented to make the industry fair, transparent, and effective.\u201d\n\nThe proposed ballot measures will have to change the minds of voters to be successful at the ballot box. In April 2024, a from MassINC Polling Group found that 65% of Massachusetts residents think that legalizing marijuana in the state was the right decision.",

      "text": "Politics\nMassachusetts Would Recriminalize Recreational Marijuana Sales Under 2026 Ballot Initiatives Being Reviewed By Attorney General\nThe attorney general of Massachusetts has published dozens of proposed initiatives for the 2026 ballot\u2014including a pair that would roll back adult-use marijuana legalization in the state.\nAttorney General Andrea Joy Campbell\u2019s (D) office released a total of 47 initiative petitions filed by 19 groups ahead of a deadline on Wednesday. It will now review each of them to determine if they can be legally certified.\nThe two marijuana measures, which would eliminate the commercial adult-use market while maintaining patient access under the medical cannabis program and continuing to allow lawful possession of up to an ounce of recreational marijuana, is being spearheaded by Caroline Cunningham, who previously fought against a psychedelics legalization ballot initiative that voters ultimately rejected last year.\nUnder the new measures\u2014titled \u201cAn Act to Restore A Sensible Marijuana Policy\u201d\u2014adults 21 and older could still possess up to an ounce of cannabis, only five grams of which could be a marijuana concentrate product.\nPossession of more than one ounce but less than two ounces would be effectively decriminalized, with violators subject to a $100 fine. Adults could also continue to gift cannabis between each other without remuneration.\nBut provisions in the state\u2019s voter-approved marijuana law that allow for commercial cannabis retailers and access to regulated products by adults would be repealed under the proposal.\nAdults\u2019 right to cultivate cannabis at home would also be repealed.\nThere are two versions of the initiative. They\u2019re largely identical\u2014except that one would set THC potency limits on medical marijuana, requiring the Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) to prohibit flower in excess of 30 percent THC and concentrates over 60 percent THC or that have more than 5mg THC per metered serving. There would also be a ban on cannabis concentrates that \u201cfail to clearly provide metered, or otherwise measured, standard delivered servings\u201d of 5 mg THC and on packages of concentrate that exceed 20 metered or measured servings.\nAfter reviewing all of the proposed initiatives to determine if they\u2019re consistent with constitutional requirements for ballot placement, the attorney general\u2019s office will then certify them and issue finalized summaries, clearing proponents to start signature gathering.\nThey will need to turn in 74,574 valid signatures from registered voters to the secretary of state\u2019s office by December 3, initiating a separate verification process to certify the signatures.\nWhether the cannabis measures make the cut is yet to be seen. Voters approved legalization at the ballot in 2016, with sales launching two years later. And the past decade has seen the market evolve and expand. As of last month, Massachusetts officials reported more than $8 billion in adult-use marijuana sales.\n\u2014\nMarijuana Moment is tracking hundreds of cannabis, psychedelics and drug policy bills in state legislatures and Congress this year. Patreon supporters pledging at least $25/month get access to our interactive maps, charts and hearing calendar so they don\u2019t miss any developments.\nLearn more about our marijuana bill tracker and become a supporter on Patreon to get access.\n\u2014\nRegulators are also working to finalize rules to allow for a new cannabis consumption lounge license type, which they hope to complete by October.\nSeparately, in May CCC launched an online platform aimed at helping people find jobs, workplace training and networking opportunities in the state\u2019s legal cannabis industry.\nState lawmakers have also been considering setting tighter restrictions on intoxicating hemp-derived products and a plan to allow individual entities to control a larger number of cannabis establishments.\nAlso in Massachusetts, legislators who were working on a state budget butted heads with CCC officials, who\u2019ve said they can\u2019t make critical technology improvements without more money from the legislature.\nPhoto courtesy of Philip Steffan."

      "text": "Last year was a roller coaster for the cannabis industry. Both presidential candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, came out in favor of reforming the nation\u2019s marijuana laws. But when it came to ballot measures, efforts to legalize adult-use failed in Florida, North and South Dakota.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all bad news. Nebraska legalized medical marijuana, making it the 39th state to allow for medicinal use of cannabis. And in December, the Drug Enforcement Administration held its first meeting about the effort to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug\u2014it is currently in Schedule I, the same category as heroin and LSD.\nEven though federal reform remains at a standstill, the majority of Americans live in a state where marijuana is legal. Currently, 24 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational use for adults 21 years and older and 39 states have medical programs. Cannabidiol (CBD), another active ingredient in cannabis that is associated with some medical benefits but does not get users high, is federally legal. And an additional 10 states have passed laws to permit the use of products containing CBD and small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the compound in marijuana responsible for getting people stoned. That leaves only one state\u2014Idaho\u2014that does not allow for any kind of state-sanctioned marijuana or cannabis-derived product use.\nWhen it comes to hemp-derived THC, which packs the same punch as weed and is federally legal, nearly all Americans can go to a smoke shop, wellness store or gas station and pick up some edibles or vapes. Despite all of this, marijuana is still illegal at the federal level.\nWith President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House later this month, cannabis company executives, advocates and lawyers are optimistic about 2025 being a good year for the budding industry.\nThe legendary litigator David Boies, who has brought a case seeking to federally legalize state-licensed marijuana, told Forbes late last year that a second Trump term will bode well for weed. \u201cWe are much more likely to see positive change,\u201d said Boies. \u201cTrump\u2019s default is to let the states have it. His inclination is to let people do what they want.\u201d\nIn the states that have legalized cannabis, there has been a lot of growth. New York, which had a rocky roll out plagued with a wild west of unlicensed pot shops, is gaining traction and surpassed $1 billion in legal cannabis sales just two years after its launch. California, which is home to the nation\u2019s largest legal marijuana market, just legalized Amsterdam-style cafes where customers can toke up.\nPaul Armentano, deputy director of nonprofit marijuana legalization advocacy group NORML, says that while it is exciting to ponder changes at the federal level, 2025 will be defined by changes made in individual states.\n\u201cI think the last four years showed us the reality that executive actions can only go so far,\u201d says Armentano. \u201cThe fact is that the Biden Administration was arguably the administration with the most sympathy for marijuana policy reform that we've ever had but the power to change federal marijuana laws doesn't lie with the President. That power lies with Congress.\u201d\nAnd with both chambers of Congress controlled by Republicans, who have historically not embraced cannabis legalization, he is not optimistic about federal reform. \u201cIt's possible that the Trump Administration might lean on some of these lawmakers to prioritize this issue, but there's certainly no indication from past history that that is something the administration would do,\u201d says Armentano.\nAs for the DEA rescheduling process, the next hearing will be held on January 21. But do not expect a quick decision.\n\u201cThis is a long process with lots of twists and turns, and anybody who tries to speak definitively with regard to either what the outcome is going to be or when we're going to have that outcome is speaking out of turn,\u201d he says. \u201cWe're probably still talking years. I know nobody wants to hear that, but that's just reality.\u201d\nRegardless of the outcome and timeline, this year should be one filled with cannabis making headlines. Here\u2019s where the cannabis map could expand in 2025.\nHawaii\nHawaii was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through the state legislature in 2000 but has not been able to legalize a recreational market. The archipelago\u2019s lawmakers tried to pass adult-use in 2024, but the bill passed by the Senate died in committee. The governor, house and senate are all controlled by Democrats, which is a good sign for cannabis reform.\n\u201cI would dare say that Hawaii is the jurisdiction where the prospects are the most realistic for legalization this session,\u201d says Armentano.\nPennsylvania\nThe Keystone State legalized medical marijuana in 2016 and Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, the state\u2019s former attorney general, is in favor of recreational cannabis. Every state bordering Pennsylvania has legalized adult-use cannabis, except for West Virginia which has a strict and limited medical program.\n\u201cThe nation is now looking at Pennsylvania to be the next large state to legalize adult-use cannabis,\u201d advocacy group Responsible PA said in a statement after Democrats retained their one seat majority in the House. \u201cThe conversation will also undoubtedly become a major budget item for PA lawmakers heading into 2025.\u201d\nAlthough Republicans control Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate, there is some bipartisan support for legalization. Governor Shapiro said that he will add recreational cannabis legalization in the state budget request this year again, which would be the third time he has done so.\n\u201cFolks are going across state borders in order to purchase it and paying taxes to those states. They should be keeping their money right here in Pennsylvania,\u201d the Governor told TribLive.\nWisconsin\nSixty-three percent of Wisconsin residents favor legalizing marijuana and 86% support medical marijuana, according to a Marquette University Law School poll. While the Senate rejected a bill proposed by the Assembly that featured state-run dispensaries in 2024, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a year-end interview that there is hope for a medical program but no hope for a recreational program.\n\u201cA red line for us is that we do not want, like it has in almost every other state, medical marijuana to lead to recreational marijuana,\u201d Vos told the Sentinel. \u201cI think there is a legitimate, compassionate purpose for medicinal, I don\u2019t really see any reason for recreational.\u201d"

      "text": "A proposed ballot initiative in MA would roll back marijuana legalization. Will it pass?\n- Two of the proposed laws, both filed by Caroline Cunningham, would repeal provisions in the current marijuana law that allow for the drug to be sold commercially in the state.\n- Proposed laws and constitutional amendments must go through a long process to make it to the statewide election ballot in November 2026.\n- Polls taken since legalization have shown that Massachusetts residents largely approve of marijuana legalization.\nA group of Massachusetts citizens have filed an initiative petition to roll back marijuana legalization in the state, according to the MA attorney general\u2019s office.\nOn Aug. 6, the attorney general\u2019s office announced that 19 groups had filed 47 initiative petitions for new proposed laws or constitutional amendments.\nTwo of the proposed laws, both filed by Caroline Cunningham and signed by about 14 others, would repeal provisions in the current marijuana law passed in 2016 that allow for the drug to be sold commercially in the state. However, the process to become law is lengthy, and there are other challenges in its way.\nWhat do the marijuana initiatives say?\nThe two proposed laws on marijuana are largely similar.\nBoth titled \u201cAn Act to Restore a Sensible Marijuana Policy,\u201d they would repeal Chapters 94G and 64N in the Massachusetts general laws, which are sections that regulate the use, distribution and taxation of recreational marijuana.\nIt would also repeal adults\u2019 right to cultivate cannabis at home.\nIt would decriminalize possession of more than one ounce but less than two ounces, and a violation of the law would only be a civil offense with a fine $100. While retail sales wouldn\u2019t be allowed, adults would still be able to gift cannabis to each other.\nMedical marijuana would stay legal under the proposals, but one would tighten THC limitations.\nWill the initiatives succeed?\nProposed laws and constitutional amendments must go through a long process to make it to the statewide election ballot in November 2026.\nFirst, the attorney general\u2019s office must review whether the petitions meet certain constitutional requirements to be filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. They will announce whether it\u2019s been approved for certification on Sept. 3.\nIf the initiative petition for a proposed law is approved, the initiatives proponents are then required to gather 75,574 signatures from registered voters to file with the Secretary of the Commonwealth by Dec. 3.\nOnce those signatures are verified, it will be sent to the state Legislature in January for its approval.\nIf the Legislature does not enact the proposal, the proponents must then gather an additional 12,429 signatures from registered voters by July 1, 2026, to place the initiative on the November 2026 ballot.\nThe proposed laws are likely to face a few challenges along the way. Massachusetts has increasingly legalized marijuana and reduced criminal charges associated with the drug. Voters made recreational cannabis legal in 2016, and retail sales became legal two years later. In 2024, Gov. Maura Healey pardoned misdemeanor marijuana possession convictions before March 13, 2024. And this year, the Democrat-controlled state House passed a bill that would expand marijuana laws, including increasing the purchase and possession limit from one to two ounces of marijuana.\nIn July the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission reported that total marijuana sales in the state have surpassed $8 billion.\nPolls taken since legalization have also shown that Massachusetts residents largely approve of marijuana legalization. The MassINC Polling Group found in April 2024 found that 65% of Massachusetts residents think that legalizing marijuana in Massachusetts was the right decision."
