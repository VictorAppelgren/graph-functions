The company’s debt‑to‑equity ratio of 107 % signals high leverage, while analysts see a modest €400 k profit in 2026 if growth targets are met. Market sentiment is bearish, with the stock trading well below its estimated fair value of €1.6, reflecting concerns over profitability and capital structure.",
