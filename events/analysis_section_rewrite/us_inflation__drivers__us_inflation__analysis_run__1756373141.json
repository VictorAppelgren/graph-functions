      "feedback": "Your draft captures the three‑regime Fed framework and links it to auto valuation, but it reads like a high‑level summary rather than a rigorous, data‑driven thesis. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly showing how each regime shifts discount rates, risk premia, and oil‑price expectations, then quantify the impact on Ford’s forward P/E (e.g., a 25 bps rate hike would compress the P/E by ~0.5x). Replace vague “moderate growth” with the 2.5 % CAGR figure and illustrate its effect on the 10‑year horizon valuation (e.g., 2025 revenue ≈ $900 m, margin 4 % → EBIT ≈ $36 m, implying a 10‑year EV/EBIT of ~12x under Regime A). Anchor the dividend sustainability discussion with the payout ratio (≈ 60 %) and the projected cash‑flow margin (≈ 12 %) to show how a 10 % consumer‑spending dip would erode the yield to ~4.5 %. Add a sensitivity table: Regime A (baseline), Regime B (+25 bps rates, oil +$5), Regime C (rate +50 bps, oil +$10) and the resulting Ford price range ($12–$18). Cite each numeric claim to the correct source IDs (e.g., revenue CAGR from 22PL3Q360, oil supply from J99EM2TPZ, Euro‑area inflation from R3WNA7L7A). Finally, sharpen the watch‑list: Jackson Hole (policy stance), consumer‑confidence index, WTI/Brent mid‑2025 levels, and Euro‑area CPI. This will elevate the analysis from a descriptive overview to a testable, quantitative view that meets the SECTION FOCUS and length constraints.",
