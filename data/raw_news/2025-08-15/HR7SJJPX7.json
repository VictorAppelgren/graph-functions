  "description": "Dillian Whyte is a veteran who has fought at the highest levels. But at his age, can he handle Moses Itauma.",
  "content": "The last time Dillian Whyte fought on such a big world stage, he was getting knocked around by Tyson Fury and basically looked like he was done boxing meaningful matches. But on Saturday, Whyte, at the age of 37, has another chance to headline a big-time show. The problem? Moses Itauma, one of the best prospects in the sport, is looking to duplicate Fury\u2019s performance by knocking out Whyte. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Moses Itauma vs. Dillian Whyte, including the odds, their records and a prediction on who will win.\n\nWhen Whyte fought Fury three years ago, he was certainly the underdog. But some believed he still had a chance (and he was only a relatively modest +350 underdog). And then Fury went to work blasting him with punches. Will Itauma do the same?\n\n\u201cI'm up against it [vs. Itaumi], but it's a good place to be. I haven't got anything to lose, so it's good to be in this position. I've got nothing to prove to myself,\u201d Whyte said this week. \u201cI've far surpassed where I've come from. Sometimes, I think to myself: I\u2019m 37 years old, I've got a wife, kids, and I'm one of the best fighters in the world. Sometimes, it's unbelievable. I'd love to get a chance to avenge my defeats, and I'd love to fight for a world title again. I don't think I did myself justice last time. Sometimes, you're there but not really there, and I think that's what happened in the Fury fight.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s \u201cnot really there\u201d against Itauma, that potentially could be a dangerous problem.\n\nEven though Itauma hasn\u2019t faced anybody at Whyte\u2019s level (even if Whyte\u2019s prime was at least a half-decade ago), the 20-year-old has impressed observers with his power and skills.\n\n\u201cDillian is a big name, good opposition,\u201d Itauma told the Toe2Toe podcast, via Sky Sports. \u201cIt's for me to go in there and do the job. I've got to box to a game plan. If I box to the game plan, it shouldn't be a long night.\u201d\n\nConsidering none of his last eight opponents have lasted into the third round, Itauma makes a good point. And Whyte, while considered a tough guy, has been knocked out in all three of his losses. That could make for a bad combination and a short night for Whyte.\n\nBut those are lofty expectations for Itauma, his trainer said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the whole, \u2018Oh, Moses blows him [Whyte] away in a couple of rounds,\u2019\u201d Ben Davison said, via Boxing Scene. \u201cBecause if there was any other heavyweight boxing Dillian Whyte \u2014 any other heavyweight \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t be saying he was a one- or two-round job. Not one other heavyweight. No one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that can\u2019t happen, but if that was to happen, [Itauma] deserves credit for that. For that to just be, \u2018Ah, it\u2019s expected.\u2019 What? Where\u2019s that come from? It\u2019s a good name, a great chance for him to show where he\u2019s at, but also, at the same time, it\u2019s a big step up for him as well.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s more info on the Moses Itauma vs. Dillian Whyte showdown that U.S. viewers can watch on DAZN PPV for $49.99 beginning at 12:45 p.m. ET on Saturday.\n\nItauma is the hefty betting favorite at -900 (bet $900 to win $100), while Whyte is the +550 underdog (win $550 on a $100 wager). I don\u2019t think taking Whyte\u2019s money line is an outlandish decision, but maybe wait to see if it gets to +600 close to the fight. Otherwise, you could go with Itauma by stoppage at -400. If you\u2019re interested in an over-under, you could go under 3.5 rounds at +162.\n\nIf you were looking for a fun parlay for this weekend\u2019s action of boxing (and this is only for entertainment purposes), I might take Itauma to stop Whyte at -400, Nick Ball to beat Sam Goodman by decision at +187 and Filip Hrgovic to beat David Adeleye at -500. If all those hit, you\u2019d earn a $330 profit on a $100 wager.\n\nWhyte, by far, will be the biggest name so far on Itauma\u2019s resume. For Itauma (12-0, 10 KOs), the most recognizable name on his list of opponents is the long-faded Mariusz Wach. In his last two fights, though, Itauma\u2019s opponents were a combined 43-2. For what it\u2019s worth, Itauma is on an eight-fight stoppage streak.\n\nWhile amassing a 31-3 (21 KOs) record during his 14-year career, Whyte has proven he can beat B-level and below fighters (at least he could when he was his prime). But when faced against true world class competition, he\u2019s fallen to fighters like Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Alexander Povetkin. His biggest victories came against Povetkin in their rematch, Joseph Parker and Derek Chisora twice when Chisora was closer to his prime.\n\nThough he never won a world title, Whyte has had a productive career, and he\u2019s been in some rugged, exciting fights. Hopefully, he will look back on his career and feel proud. But this won\u2019t end well for him vs. Itauma, who\u2019s too young and too powerful for Whyte. Say, Itauma by fourth-round stoppage.",

Get Sky Sports or stream with no contract on NOW \ud83d\udcfa\n- Choose the Sky Sports push notifications you want!\nItauma plans to make Whyte - who has fought the likes of Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua - the highest-profile addition to his growing list of victims.\n\"Dillian is a big name, good opposition,\" he told the Toe2Toe podcast. \"It's for me to go in there and do the job. I've got to box to a game plan. If I box to the game plan, it shouldn't be a long night.\"\nThe bout marks Itauma's first time headlining a major show but he's undaunted by the occasion and is instead relishing the occasion and the step up in quality.\n\"This is my first headline show, it's in Saudi Arabia against Dillian Whyte and I'm only 20 years old,\" he said.\n\"Just having that comes with pressure, but I love a bit of pressure. I acknowledge it, but I don't feel it. I know it's there, but I don't let it sink in - only because it does me no favours. I'm ready to perform Saturday night.\"\nUsyk next?\nThe ruthless manner in which Itauma has dismantled every opponent so far has sparked calls for him to be fast-tracked into the world title conversation.\nAlready ranked first by the WBO, a dominant win over Whyte would only intensify talk of a showdown with undisputed heavyweight king Oleksandr Usyk.\n\"One day, inshallah,\" Itauma added. \"I'm learning my Arabic since I've been out in Saudi!\n\"I think it will happen. I think Joseph Parker and Agit Kabayel do deserve the opportunity to fight for those belts. But you don't get what you deserve nowadays, you get what you negotiate for.\n\"If I am able to beat Dillian Whyte in good fashion, and I'm already ranked No 1 with the WBO, so I do feel I'll be in a position to fight him.\""

      "text": "The last time Dillian Whyte was knocked out, he went on to reel off 11-straight wins and set himself up for a title shot. Now that he\u2019s coming off another stoppage loss, his rematch vs. Alexander Povetkin on Saturday could make or break the rest of his boxing career. And it could put him back into heavyweight title contention. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Alexander Povetkin vs. Dillian Whyte, including the odds, their records and a prediction on who will win.\nThe first time Whyte and Povetkin met last August, Whyte was winning the fight on the scorecards and had knocked down Povetkin twice in the fourth round. But in the process of trying to put Povetkin away for good in the fifth, Povetkin caught Whyte with a beautiful uppercut that sent him to the canvas in a heap. It was the knockout (and one of the best comebacks) of the year.\n\u201cI was a fighter a long time before I was a boxer. I\u2019ve been knocking people out for a long time,\u201d Whyte said. \u201cI carry a lot of power in both hands. Povetkin is a very cagey guy and an experienced guy, a very patient guy. He\u2019s a tough guy as well. Last time I didn\u2019t land properly and he went down, but he showed resilience by getting up and then he stopped me. This time when I hit him, he\u2019ll stay down.\u201d\nEven though he\u2019s coming off that knockout loss, Whyte is still the betting favorite. Probably because he performed well against Povetkin up until the moment he got caught but also because Povetkin is 41 and because his career seemingly is winding down. There\u2019s no doubt, though, that Povetkin can be tricky in the ring and that he still has plenty of power.\nOh, and don\u2019t call his uppercut of Whyte a lucky punch.\n\u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t a lucky punch,\u201d Povetkin said this week. \u201cPeople who think that don\u2019t understand boxing. I was training on that punch from the left and the right side. There was nothing about a lucky punch in this case.\u201d\nWhyte probably understands this as well. But that hasn\u2019t stopped him from questioning why he\u2019s had to wait seven months for a rematch or whether Povetkin really tested positive for COVID-19 that forced a postponement on the rematch. Maybe he\u2019s trying to psyche out Povetkin. Maybe he\u2019s just talking trash to draw in more viewers.\nEither way, Whyte realizes this is a must-win fight. And the way he\u2019s transformed his body tells the tale.\nSaid Whyte: \u201cI don\u2019t care if I have to throw two jabs and move or get in and throw power punches and rough him up. I\u2019ll do whatever I have to do. I\u2019m not worried about a career-best performance, I\u2019m worried about getting the win. My mindset is I\u2019ve got a job to do and I\u2019ll do whatever I need to do to get it done \u2026 It's the biggest fight of my career. I\u2019m coming off a loss to the guy. The good thing is this is heavyweight boxing. One fight changes everything.\u201d\nHere\u2019s more info on the Alexander Povetkin vs. Dillian Whyte showdown that U.S. viewers can watch on DAZN beginning at 2 p.m. ET on Saturday.\nAlexander Povetkin vs. Dillian Whyte odds\nIt makes sense that Whyte would be the betting favorite against Povetkin even though Povetkin knocked him out last time (Povetkin is much older and was getting beat up by Whyte before the stoppage). But the money keeps coming in on Whyte. As of Friday, Whyte was a -400 favorite (bet $400 to win $100) on Bet 365, but when the rematch was first announced, he was only -275. Povetkin, meanwhile, is +275 (earn $275 on a $100 wager).\nSports Betting Dime has virtually the same odds with Whyte at -400 and Povetkin at +280. If it were me, I\u2019d avoid the Whyte money line and bet on him to win by KO/TKO at -175. He was trending that way in their first encounter, and I think he\u2019ll finish the job on Saturday. You could pick Whyte to win by KO in either rounds 4-6 or 7-9, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough value for you there at +350.\nIf you like Povetkin to pull off another upset, you could pick him to win by KO/TKO at +333.\nAlexander Povetkin vs. Dillian Whyte records\nPovetkin is a former heavyweight titlist and Olympic gold medalist, and though he\u2019s had a successful career and has built an impressive record of 36-2-1 (25 KOs), he\u2019s never beat the absolute best of the division. His two losses came to Wladimir Klitschko and Anthony Joshua. In my eyes, Whyte is not as good as those fighters but is still better than Povetkin\u2019s best wins (Carlos Takam, Marco Huck).\nWhyte has waited years as a mandatory title opponent to finally get his shot at a belt. Then, his KO loss to Povetkin wiped out that opportunity. But if Whyte (27-2, 18 KOs) wins the rematch, he, once again, will be considered one of the five best heavyweights in the world.\nAlexander Povetkin vs. Dillian Whyte prediction\nWhyte is dead serious about this rematch. And he should be. Eddie Hearn, Whyte\u2019s promoter, said this week that \u201cif he loses against Povetkin, [a shot at a heavyweight championship] is out\u2014and it's not just out for six months or a year. That could be out forever.\u201d Obviously, Povetkin is still dangerous. But Whyte might be a little more cautious this time around and look to box a little more. Until the late rounds when Whyte stops Povetkin. Say, Whyte by stoppage in the ninth round."

      "text": "Trainer Ben Davison has worked with all shapes and styles of fighter. From the southpaw skills of Billy Joe Saunders to the towering trickery of Tyson Fury and the athletic power of Anthony Joshua, the coach has seen a lot.\nArguably, some of his finest work is coming with fast-rising heavyweight Moses Itauma.\nBoxingScene\u2019s 2024 Prospect of the Year is tabbed by most hardcore aficionados as one of the sport\u2019s brightest hopes.\nItauma, 12-0 (10 KOs), will next face veteran contender Dillian Whyte in a notable step up this Saturday on DAZN PPV from ANB Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nStill only 20, Itauma \u2013 a Slovakian-born British southpaw raised in Chatham, Kent \u2013 is expected to have his way with Whyte.\nAccording to Davison, that should not be the case at this stage of his career. But such is the buzz around Itauma that it is widely believed that Whyte will join Mariusz Wach, Demsey McKean and Mike Balogun on his growing highlight reel.\nWach lasted two rounds, as did Balogun. McKean was gone in one. Itauma knocked the three men down five times in all over the course of his past three starts.\nItauma\u2019s manager, Frank Warren, has talked extensively about his belief in the talent his fighter has.\nDavison knows it has got to the point where Itauma \u2013 having his fourth fight in 13 outings in Saudi Arabia \u2013 is expected to shine brightly every time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the whole, \u2018Oh, Moses blows him [Whyte] away in a couple of rounds,\u2019\u201d Davison said. \u201cBecause if there was any other heavyweight boxing Dillian Whyte \u2013 any other heavyweight \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t be saying he was a one- or two-round job. Not one other heavyweight. No one.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that can\u2019t happen, but if that was to happen, [Itauma] deserves credit for that. For that to just be, \u2018Ah, it\u2019s expected.\u2019 What? Where\u2019s that come from? It\u2019s a good name, a great chance for him to show where he\u2019s at, but also, at the same time, it\u2019s a big step up for him as well.\u201d\nDavison understandably takes a cautious approach, though the numbers are in line with public perception.\nItauma boasts an 83 per cent KO ratio, and Whyte, 31-3 (21 KOs) has been stopped in all of his three losses, which have come against Anthony Joshua, Alexander Povetkin and Tyson Fury.\nJoshua went on to become a two-time, unified heavyweight titlist, while Fury was the lineal and WBC heavyweight champion at the time of their April 2022 affair.\nWhyte avenged the Povetkin loss, and he has won three since a Fury uppercut turned his lights out at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. His current streak includes victories over Jermaine Franklin, Christian Hammer and Ebeneezer Tetteh.\nItauma is unlike any heavyweight out there, and Davison has been working with him to enhance the fighter\u2019s own style.\n\u201cI'll be honest I thought he lacked identity,\u201d Davison said of his start with Itauma. \u201cI thought he had a great skill set, but [his identity] wasn\u2019t very clear. The way I explain it is, this is the chunk of the tree and then we\u2019ve got branches, we can branch off it \u2026 this is the fundamentals, this is what the rest of my work comes off. I think that\u2019s what he's developed now.\u201d\nItauma was on Davison\u2019s radar long before the prospect turned pro.\nHe had already been making waves in gyms in the UK as an amateur, and he visited Davison\u2019s gym to spar Jeamie TKV, who is trained by Barry Smith at Davison\u2019s Performance Centre in Essex, UK.\nItauma has boxed just 25 rounds as a pro. Whyte is approaching 200. And it is rounds that Davison would like to see Itauma start to bank.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s so cliche, but it would do him the world of good,\u201d Davison added. \u201cDo you have to have it? No, he\u2019s getting rounds in the gym. So again, he\u2019s got a good enough IQ and he\u2019s got an understanding now of, I can see the signs of what would make the rounds an issue. I now understand why that would happen and how to prevent that from happening.\u201d\nBut rounds are proving tough to get.\nItauma\u2019s power, tactics, speed and movement have left everyone floundering. The two opponents who went the distance with him managed to do six rounds in his third and fourth fights.\nAnd the pressure must be mounting, with the expectation not just on Itauma but on Davison, too. But the coach is well-qualified for it, having marshaled Tyson Fury through his return and coached Anthony Joshua on some big nights.\n\u201cYeah, of course, you get that,\u201d Davison admitted. \u201cObviously [Itauma is] probably as big of a prospect as you\u2019re going to have, to be honest, but I\u2019ve had other big prospects as well. It\u2019s part and parcel for the game.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s there, unless you\u2019ve got a lad that not many people know about, in six-rounders, eight-rounders, 10-rounders, whatever, then there\u2019s not much pressure on. But the rest of them, it\u2019s the same as working with somebody at a very high level. There\u2019s always going to be pressure, but that\u2019s what motivates and keeps you disciplined and makes sure you make the right moves at the right time.\u201d\nThat is crucial, and there is no rush at Itauma\u2019s age.\nAt the same time, Davison is bullish about what he has.\n\u201cThere isn't anybody that I would hesitate to put him in with,\u201d he said, before qualifying the statement. \u201cWhen I say that, there\u2019s a difference between \u2018That fight makes more sense than that fight,\u2019 because that fight might be just as hard, but there\u2019s more to gain fighting that person.\u201d\nIt was Turki Alalshikh, the Saudi power broker, who fired off a message on X that Itauma versus undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk, 24-0 (15 KOs), is the fight to make. Itauma is unranked in Ring\u2019s top 10, but he is No. 1 in the WBO, No. 2 in the WBA, No. 6 in the IBF and No. 11 with the WBC.\n\u201cYeah, so that is a prime example,\u201d Davison said, asked about the mention of Usyk-Itauma. \u201cThat is the one for me, because I think if it was a six-round fight, I would put my money on Moses. But it\u2019s a 12-round fight. That\u2019s not necessarily anything to do with gas tank; that\u2019s just to do with experience in a sense of having to think at that level for that duration. But like I said, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do that fight.\u201d\nIt comes down to patience and, as Davison said, making the right moves at the right time.\nWarren, Itauma\u2019s promoter, is the master at that. Given a heavyweight\u2019s propensity to develop later, there is no blind rush with Itauma; one false move among the big men and things can change with a single punch.\n\u201cThat can happen at any level, any weight in boxing,\u201d said Davison. \u201cBut especially with a heavyweight.\u201d\nTris Dixon covered his first amateur boxing fight in 1996.

      "text": "Tyson Fury is one of boxing\u2019s most prolific trash talkers. If he doesn\u2019t like you (or he pretends he doesn\u2019t like you) or doesn\u2019t feel like you deserve respect, he will literally shout out about it from every rooftop he can find. But whether he\u2019s actually thinking about retiring after Saturday night\u2019s fight vs. Dillian Whyte or he actually has some respect for his opponent, Fury has been calmer than normal this week. Whether that means anything for his heavyweight championship fight remains to be seen. Either way, here\u2019s everything you need to know about Tyson Fury vs. Dillian Whyte, including the odds, their records and a prediction on who will win.\nFury is coming off two impressive knockouts of Deontay Wilder. While Whyte has more technical skills, he has less punching power than Wilder. So, maybe Fury doesn\u2019t feel he has to be quite as cautious against Whyte, because the threat of a one-punch knockout doesn\u2019t loom quite as large.\nStill, Fury clearly knows Whyte is dangerous.\n\u201cDillian Whyte is a good fighter,\u201d Fury said. \u201cHe is a good, strong, solid man. He\u2019s big. He\u2019s strong. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s game. He\u2019s got good power. He\u2019s knocked out a lot of men. He\u2019s had a good learning career as well. He\u2019s got a lot of experience in the fight game. He\u2019s definitely a man that needs a lot of respect. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve given all this training camp we\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve had everything I can possibly do to train for this. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t left any stones unturned. I\u2019ve trained as hard for Dillian as I have for Wilder or Klitschko.\u201d\nFury, though, also has been more wistful in the leadup to this fight. Perhaps it\u2019s because he\u2019s actually serious about possibly retiring.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing journey,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom where I started all those years ago to the ups and downs and being away from boxing and being fat as ****, 28 stone. To coming back and being mentally out, a druggie and an alcoholic\u2014all of the rest of the stuff\u2014I\u2019m not ashamed of it. It\u2019s a part of who I am. To coming back and getting back to the top of the world and having three big fights with Deontay Wilder over there in the U.S., and now being back in England after all these years, four years away, and now I\u2019m fighting my old pal Dillian Whyte back at home for all the glory and all the belts. Who would have thought it?\u201d\nIt's true. Despite his mental and physical issues, Fury has been a heavyweight champion since he beat Wladimir Klitschko in 2015. Whyte, meanwhile, has never tasted that kind of glory. He\u2019s been a top-five heavyweight for the past several years, but he\u2019s never had the career-changing opportunity he\u2019ll get vs. Fury.\n\u201cThis is one of those fights where I\u2019ve been working on being adaptable,\u201d Whyte said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to adapt, make smart decisions, when I need to do what and how I need to do it, and how I need to approach what I\u2019m doing. So that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no strategy here. That\u2019s it. I just need to go in there and do my thing.\u201d\nHere\u2019s more info on the Tyson Fury vs. Dillian Whyte showdown that U.S. viewers can watch for $69.99 on ESPN+ PPV beginning at 2 p.m. ET on Saturday.\nTyson Fury vs. Dillian Whyte odds\nWhile Fury is the solid betting favorite, more people seem to be wagering on Whyte. As of this writing, Fury is a -450 favorite (bet $450 to win $100), while Whyte is the +350 underdog. It\u2019s the lowest odds I\u2019ve seen for Whyte so far, so if you took him at +450 when the fight was first announced, you\u2019re probably feeling pretty good about that. Fury, meanwhile, has been as wide as -700, so if you like Fury to defend his championship, now\u2019s a decent time to bet on him.\nIf you want to get a little more specific, betting on Fury to win by KO/TKO is -125 and by decision at +240 (to me, it\u2019s a 50-50 proposition for how Fury could win this fight, so perhaps the points decision is the slightly better value). If you like Whyte, I might take him to win by stoppage at +450 (or if you\u2019re really brave, a Whyte decision victory would pay off at 22/1). I wouldn\u2019t even mind getting even more granular than that with a Fury stoppage in rounds 7-12 at +187.\nTyson Fury vs. Dillian Whyte records\nFury is undefeated at 31-0-1 (22 KOs), and he\u2019d certainly like to retire undefeated (if he, in fact, does retire). Though Fury has one of the most unique set of skills of any heavyweight champion in boxing history, his resume still isn\u2019t that fantastic. He squeaked by Wladimir Klitschko in 2015, and though he probably should have been awarded all three of his fights vs. Deontay Wilder, Fury went 2-0-1 with 2 KOs. His victories vs. Otto Wallin (in 2019) and Dereck Chisora (in 2014) look even better in retrospect. But is this a Hall of Fame resume? Maybe not.\nWhyte (28-2, 19 KOs) has had some nice victories and some tremendous letdowns. In the biggest fight of his life, he managed to hurt Anthony Joshua early in their 2015 matchup but then was knocked out in the seventh round. He also, a little surprisingly, got knocked out by Alexander Povetkin in 2020. But Whyte has good wins as well, stopping Povetkin in their rematch, outpointing former titlist Joseph Parker, and beating Chisora twice in fantastically exciting bouts.\nTyson Fury vs. Dillian Whyte prediction\nIf this fight happened two years ago, I\u2019d be inclined to pick Fury to win by decision. But considering how aggressive and powerful Fury was vs. Wilder and considering Whyte\u2019s chin can be shaky, I think Fury will knock out Whyte. It\u2019ll be difficult, though, and Whyte\u2019s power might cause problems for Fury early. In the end, it\u2019ll be Fury by stoppage in the eighth round.\nUPDATE: If you took Fury to win by stoppage in rounds 7-12, you missed it by 1 second. That\u2019s because Fury laid out Whyte with a massive uppercut late in the sixth round, Whyte got up wobbly and the referee stopped the fight at 2:59 of the sixth round. But still, that\u2019s great news if you picked Fury to win by KO/TKO, and you picked up an additional $80 with your $100 wager.\nWith the victory, Fury made a $33.6 million purse, while Whyte walked away with $7.4 million."
