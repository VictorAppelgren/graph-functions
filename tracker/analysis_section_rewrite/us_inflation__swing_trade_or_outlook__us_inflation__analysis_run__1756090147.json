      "feedback": "The analysis has solid regime anchors and a credible macro-crypto linkage, but it currently sacrifices tight navigable structure and testable actionability; to reach world-class quality, tighten the Movers & Scenarios to four lines with exact 2 Up and 2 Down lines, each line anchored to a single regime transition (A→B or B→C) and to a concrete catalyst (e.g., inflation near 2% or ETF/crypto inflows), and ensure “What to watch” is a crisp, data-driven trigger (e.g., specific CPI/ payroll ticks, ETF inflows, or policy signals) rather than broad narrative; calibrate the probabilities strictly to material evidence (e.g., 60% for near-term Ups citing Nvidia/Santos catalysts and 85% odds of a Sep 25bp cut from the text, 40% and 30% for Downs with explicit invalidation logic) and cite only IDs that actually back those numbers (OGK8WLL69, 17F49LURJ, S1OY7ISLY, EPJYXB7DX, NL5YYTLF2, etc.). For format, convert the Outlook block into Swing Trade lines for tradable assets (BTC/ETH) or compress to a single crisp Swing Trade if you treat them as one instrument, including Direction, Horizon, Entry ranges anchored to 110k–125k BTC and 4k–5k ETH, Stop, Target, R/R, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability, and Confidence; keep the lines paired with precise price anchors and a single, testable invalidation rule (e.g., policy stasis beyond 6 weeks or a hawkish inflation surprise) drawn directly from the cited material. Reconcile numeric anchors that appear in multiple places (e.g., BTC 110k–125k and ETH 4k–5k) by adopting a single cited range per line and aggregating cross-asset implications via the same regime logic rather than duplicating ranges, and ensure every factual claim has an in-text citation tied to the SOURCE IDs only. Finally, prune nonessential macro prose, align every line to a crisp causal chain (inflation/disinflation → discount rates → asset valuations → crypto flows), and embed the core transmission through macro pricing, crypto flows, and cross-asset contagion so the Swing Trade is deeply testable against Regime A→B→C dynamics (OGK8WLL69; UPV3X2MQ6; EPJYXB7DX; SGB2PAZGK; NL5YYTLF2; 17F49LURJ; ILYC1M41F).",
