      "title": "Italy leads on Gaza medical evacuations as US freezes humanitarian pathways",
      "summary": "Italy has carried out a large-scale medical evacuation of Gazan children, treating over 180 minors and 396 relatives, in a labor-intensive humanitarian effort coordinated with multiple ministries and international agencies. The operation faces challenges such as incomplete medical records, dehydration, and the need for long-term housing and cultural mediation for families who cannot return to Gaza. A tragic death of a patient at Pisa’s hospital highlights the risks involved. In contrast, the United States has suspended all visitor visas for Gazans, citing security concerns, a move that contrasts with Italy’s openness and raises legal and diplomatic questions. The article underscores Italy’s commitment to humanitarian principles amid a broader crisis in Gaza and the divergent approaches of European and U.S. policy makers.",
