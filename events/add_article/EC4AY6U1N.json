      "summary": "Scientists worldwide have condemned a July Department of Energy report that downplayed climate change, arguing it cherry‑picked data and misrepresented scientific consensus. The report, produced by a hand‑selected team of contrarians, was used to justify fossil‑fuel policies amid the Trump administration’s broader rollbacks of environmental regulations. The scientific rebuttal, assembled in less than a month, warns that the DOE review could become a foundation for future climate policy and highlights the administration’s continued efforts to undermine climate action.",
