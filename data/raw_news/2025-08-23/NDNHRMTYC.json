  "title": "Every Pixel device announced at Made by Google this week: 10 Pro Fold, Watch, Buds, more",
  "description": "Google just unveiled its newest phones, smartwatches, and earbuds. Here's our full recap with all the specs, features, and availability details.",
  "content": "Get more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\n\n\nIt's that time of the year again. No, not Apple's product launch -- that's next month. I'm talking about Made by Google 2025. The tech giant held its annual event on Wednesday, where it showed off its upcoming releases; namely the Pixel 10 series, Pixel Watch 4, and the Pixel Buds 2a.\n\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\n\nWe managed to get a sneak peek at the devices ahead of the big day, and we're here to share everything we know. Admittedly, none of the hardware announcements are super surprising. We've had a pretty good idea that the aforementioned devices were going to be headliners, especially since Google unveiled the Pixel 10 series early in July.\n\nIt isn't all hardware reveals, however, as the event packs a few notable surprises -- including new smartphone features like Magic Cue and Pixelsnap. Google provided a more entertaining look during its presentation, but here's a quick breakdown of all the products and software updates being shown off at Made by Google.\n\nGoogle's Pixel 10 series is the star of the show. The line consists of four models: the base Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Unlike the previous generation, this batch isn't an overhaul of the Pixel line. It primarily builds on what the Pixel 9 line brought to the table.\n\nPixel 10: Starting with the base model, the Pixel 10 sports a 6.3-inch Actua display, 12GB of RAM, and a new 5x telephoto camera alongside the 50MP wide and 48MP ultrawide lenses. This new option delivers 10x optical image quality and Super Res Zoom up to 20x, letting you capture high-quality close-up shots from further away. Pricing starts at $799, and the model will be available in Obsidian (black), Indigo (blue), Frost (white), and Lemongrass (green).\n\nPixel 10 Pro: The Pro model is similar in size, sporting a 6.3-inch Super Actua display that outputs at a new peak brightness of 3,300 nits. Notable upgrades include 16GB of RAM, a purported 30-hour battery life, and a better 5x telephoto lens, allowing the Pixel 10 Pro to support 100x Pro Res Zoom for great-looking closeups. Prices start at $999, and it'll be available in Obsidian (black), Moonstone (gray), Porcelain (white), and Jade (green).\n\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\n\nPixel 10 Pro XL: The Pixel 10 Pro XL has many of the same features and specifications as the Pixel 10 Pro, with one major difference: It has a 6.8-inch Super Actua display. Prices start at $1,199, and it'll be available in the same colors as the 10 Pro.\n\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is larger than the previous generation, boasting a 6.4-inch Actua outer display and an 8-inch Super Actua inner display. Google made interesting design changes, namely what it describes as a \"new gearless, high-strength hinge\" that allows the 10 Pro Fold to survive over 10 years of constant opening and closing.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable phone to feature an IP68 rating, providing complete protection against dust and allowing it to survive brief submersion underwater. Its closest competitor, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, only supports an IP48 rating. Pricing for the Fold starts at $1,799, and it'll be available in two colors: Moonstone and Jade.\n\nAll four models run on Google's new Tensor G5 chipset, which the company says is 60% more powerful than the previous generation Tensor G4. Each smartphone boasts 30-hour battery life, key support from Gemini AI, and receives seven years of software and security updates. Preorders for the Pixel 10 series have begun, August 20, with open sales availability starting next week on August 28.\n\nYou will have to wait a while to order the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, as it won't be available until October 9.\n\nGoogle is once again utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to elevate the user experience. This time, the company is focused on improving AI assistance on its smartphones to make certain features easier to use. Additionally, Google is making an interesting design change that could revamp the way people interact with their Pixel phones.\n\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone cache (and give it a serious speed boost)\n\nMagic Cue: Magic Cue is another personal assistant AI, but one that's more proactive. Instead of waiting for your input, the feature anticipates your needs and suggests actions or provides information \"based on the context of your phone.\" For example, let's say you're calling your airline about an upcoming flight. Magic Cue will instantly bring up your flight details during the call.\n\nCamera updates: All Pixel 10 models will receive two new camera features. First is Camera Coach, which will provide suggestions on how to set up shots or recommend certain camera modes to use. Auto Best Take allows the phone to combine similar photographs into one perfect image. Then there's the improved Add Me. While functioning much like before, the feature now lets you add the photographer to bigger group photos.\n\nPixelsnap: Pixelsnap is a new magnetic technology that will be included on all Pixel 10 phones. It allows users to snap Qi2-compatible wireless chargers, stands, and grips to the back of the device. If that sounds familiar, iPhones have supported similar technology for years.\n\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\n\nTo coincide with the implementation of Pixelsnap, Google will be rolling out supporting accessories. The Pixelsnap Charger ($40) provides Qi2 wireless charging up to 25W. The Pixelsnap Charger with Stand ($70) does the same thing but sports a stable dock to support smartphones. Then there's the Pixelsnap Ring Stand ($30) for hands-free viewing. Google will also release special Pixelsnap compatible phone cases at $50 each.\n\nGoogle is revealing the Pixel Buds 2a, a new budget-friendly version of the Pixel Buds 2 Pro. Housed inside the familiar egg-shaped case, the company says this pair is the first A-Series earbuds to feature Active Noise Cancelation with Silent Seal 1.5 to block out outside noise. To hear the surrounding environment, users can activate Transparency Mode to allow sound to pass through.\n\nGoogle's Pixel Buds 2a shares multiple features with the Buds 2 Pro, including 11mm dynamic drivers, support for spatial audio, and a 5-band equalizer for adjusting the bass, treble, and other parts of the audio. The buds run on the Tensor A1 chipset and boast a 20-hour battery life with the charging case.\n\nAlso: I compared the new $130 Pixel Buds to Apple, Sony and Bose - here's how Google wins\n\nThe Pixel Buds 2a will be available on store shelves on October 9 for $130, and in two colors: Hazel (black) and Iris (light blue). Preorders open today, August 20. There is no word on when the Pixel Buds 3 Pro will roll out. However, if Google follows the same pattern with the Buds Pro and Buds 2 Pro, expect new earbuds next year.\n\nRounding out the list is the Pixel Watch 4. Google's future wearable introduces multiple design updates and extra safety features.\n\nLike the Pixel Watch 3, this model sports an Actua 360 domed display made out of tough Corning Gorilla Glass. However, this generation's touchscreen is 10% larger than before and 50% brighter, boasting 3,000 nits. Its battery sees an improvement too, now lasting a purported 40 hours on a single charge for the 45mm model and 30 hours for the 41mm watch.\n\nAlso: I tried Pixel Watch 4 - and these are my 7 favorite upgrades in Google's new watch\n\nBoth sizes are gaining 25% faster charging speeds, along with a redesigned charging system that now flanks the side edge of the watch instead of the middle surface. How this plays out in the real world remains to be tested.\n\nThe most significant design change, however, is that the Pixel Watch 4 can actually be repaired. Google says the wearable is its \"first watch designed with serviceability in mind\" as users are able to replace the display and battery.\n\nMany safety features found on the Pixel Watch 4 are carryovers from the Pixel Watch 3. You have Loss of Pulse, which allows the Watch 4 to call for an ambulance if it detects that your heart has stopped beating. Fall and Crash Detection contacts emergency services if it detects that you've had a bad fall or were in a car accident.\n\nThere is a new feature in all this. Pixel Watch 4 LTE has an SOS satellite communication function that enables users to contact emergency services if they're ever in a location without any cellular or Wi-Fi connections.\n\nAlso: The best smartwatches 2025: I wore these for weeks and found the perfect one for your wrist\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 will be available in two different sizes: 41mm and 45mm, with colors correlating to a certain size. The 45 Pixel Watch 4 will have three colors for its wrist bands: black, white, and gray. The 41mm Pixel Watch 4 keeps the white and black wrist bands, but also throws in Iris blue and Lemongrass green bands.\n\nThe 41mm Pixel Watch 4 will retail for $350, while the 45mm model will be a bit more expensive at $400. Preorders go live today, August 20. The wearable is set to hit store shelves on October 9.",

I had just wrapped up testing Samsung's $1,900 foldable phone, and Google all but confirmed the new Pixel phones would look identical to last year's, spoiling the surprise ahead of this week's event.\nThe question I had going in was simple: Was this a lack of ambition or a sign of unwavering confidence?\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nIt took only minutes of hands-on time to find the answer -- and realize just how wrong I was about which Pixel model I would actually want this year. No, the designers at Google haven't run out of ideas for decorating a glass rectangle; instead, they've improved something that was already great. And one model in particular left the biggest impression on me.\nThe Pixel 10 just barely missed the mark\nGoing into the Made by Google event, I was fully prepared to slap my wallet down for the standard Pixel 10 model, ending a seven-year streak of buying the XL/Pro variant. The writing was on the wall: A dedicated telephoto lens would give the base Pixel the camera bump it needed to rival its Pro siblings, Qi2 wireless charging with integrated magnets set the stage for Android's MagSafe moment, and a charming Indigo color (pictured above) had my caseless habits drooling.\nBut a closer examination of the device and its spec sheet revealed some not-so-obvious shortcomings. First, fitting a dedicated telephoto lens into the rear camera bar meant that Google had to downgrade to smaller main and ultrawide sensors, resulting in camera samples that, based on my albeit limited sample size, lacked color accuracy and contrast compared to the Pro models.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nGoogle is also launching a new dock mode that passively displays the time, weather, photos, and even smart home controls when the Pixel 10 is mounted on the new PixelSnap charging mount. However, the standard Pixel 10 lacks the LTPO technology -- which allows the display to refresh from 1Hz to 120Hz -- found on the Pro models, meaning it's less power efficient when docked.\nBy the end of my Pixel 10 demo, the glossy back cover of my Indigo unit was plastered with fingerprint marks -- a gentle reminder of why the most expensive phones on the market opt for satin finishes instead of shiny glass.\nI almost folded for this Pixel model\nThat left me with the Pixel 10 Pro phones, including a Fold model that features slimmer front screen bezels, a larger battery, the same Qi2 charging as the Pixel 10, and a $1,799 price tag that makes you think twice. Coming from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which greatly improved in lightness and ergonomics this year, I was fully prepared for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to feel outdated.\nInstead, the device felt balanced and, frankly, much more durable in the hand. Google's done something extravagant with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold; it's the first foldable phone ever to be certified with an IP68 rating, making it both water- and dust-resistant. Why has this never been done before? The mechanical nature of foldable phones, with all their hinge systems and rail maneuvers, makes it nearly impossible to fend off dust-sized particles.\nAlso: Google just settled the foldable phone debate with one number - and I hope Samsung is watching\nAchieving this engineering feat automatically puts the Pixel 10 Pro Fold ahead of the competition when it comes to longevity and reliability. (Again, the designers at Google are clearly not out of ideas.)\nThen came the bad news. Like previous years, Google's most expensive hardware product is a tier below the Pro and Pro XL models when it comes to general specs like camera and charging, a choice that makes the Pro Fold a tough sell against more capable, non-folding flagships. This model also charges at up to 30W wired and 15W wireless, compared to the Pro XL's 45W wired and 25W wireless.\nThat leaves two, and one big difference\nGoogle has kept the feature parity between its Pro and Pro XL models fairly balanced over the years, and from a bird's-eye view, that remains true in 2025. But then you start to notice the minor ways in which the XL model pulls ahead and wonder if the gap has ever been larger.\nLike with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, charging and endurance are the most notable differences between the Pro and Pro XL. The latter has both a larger battery (5,200mAh vs. 4,870mAh) and faster wired and wireless charging. It's also the only Pixel model this year to support the new Qi2.5 standard, allowing it to pull in wireless energy at a 25W rating.\nI've also found the Pro XL model's larger 6.8-inch screen more optimal for Google's various new AI features, whether it's for displaying Magic Cues in messages and phone calls, or photo tips when Camera Coach is turned on, cementing it as the phone I'll likely upgrade to this summer."

Here's how I help friends and family decide\nLike clockwork, a new iPhone has made its way through the rumor mill in August, and users are beginning to wonder if they should buy what's currently available or wait until fall to see how things play out.\nBased on past trends, there's a good chance Apple will unveil the iPhone 17 series in September. So, should you pick up an iPhone 16 from your local Apple store today or play the long game?\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you\nHaving tested every major smartphone release over the past several years and helped numerous family and friends overcome this exact dilemma, here's the decision tree I use that works every single time.\n1. Do you need a new phone right now?\nPretty simple, right? If you're currently using a handset that's severely damaged or defected in a way that prevents it from completing your daily tasks, then it's time to buy a new phone right now.\nI've had friends say that they'd be willing to power through another month with a heavily cracked iPhone if it meant they could just buy the next-generation model. However, that doesn't take into consideration the fact that Apple typically sells its newest iPhones weeks (if not longer) after they're officially unveiled to the public.\nAlso: You can download iOS 26 public beta right now - how to install (and which iPhones support it)\nSo, what's expected to be a month's wait time can easily become two months or more, depending on which configuration and model you buy. That's to say, if you need a new phone today, don't wait -- buy one ASAP.\n2. How much are you looking to spend?\nEvery new iPhone launch has a big unknown: pricing. So, your current (and expected) budget should also be considered as you decide which model to buy. Apple's done a commendable job stabilizing iPhone prices over the years, with the base model typically starting at $799, the Pro at $999, and the Pro Max at $1,199, so most people would assume the iPhone 17 series will cost about the same.\nBut there are a few more variables factoring into this year's iPhone launch. First, Apple is expected to release a new iPhone 17 Air (or Slim) model that features a thinner and lighter design than the standard variant. If it follows Samsung's price strategy with its ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Edge, we can be looking at an iPhone that's priced just below the Pro models.\nAlso: Should you buy a refurbished iPhone 15 from Apple? Only if these factors matter to you\nOngoing tariff and trade talks have also led market analysts to believe that Apple will raise the price of iPhones starting this September. According to Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, the iPhone 17 Air, Pro, and Pro Max may see a $50 price increase, or a 4-5% bump from last year, in order to offset the cost of new components and exports. Here's a snapshot comparison to the iPhone 16 series.\niPhone 16 prices | iPhone 17 prices (expected) | |\nStandard | $799 | $799 |\nAir/Slim | - | $949 |\nPro | $999 | $1,049 |\nPro Max | $1,199 | $1,249 |\nIf the potential price increase gives you pause, then it may make more financial sense to buy an older iPhone model like the 16 or 15, or even the new but accessible iPhone 16e (starting at $599). Apple typically reduces the price of the last-generation iPhone model by $100 when a new one is released, so there's a good chance you'll be able to buy the iPhone 16 for as low as $699 later in September -- should you choose to wait things out.\nAlso: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why you should do it before installing iOS 26 public beta)\nLastly, while carriers and retailers typically offer aggressive trade-in and buy-one-get-one deals when a new phone is released, these deals are not without their catches and fine print.\nMost \"free phone\" offers by major carriers usually come in exchange for locking into a long-term contract or upgrading to a pricier data plan. That's not to say that the deals aren't worth it; for the right customer, they can really net you a new iPhone without much extra work. Just remember to do your due diligence before agreeing to anything.\n3. Do the rumored iPhone 17 features excite you?\nWhile none of these rumored features have been confirmed or made official by Apple, they give us a glimpse of the next iPhone's potential. Here's a list of expected changes this year, pulled from industry experts, supply chain analysts, and more.\n- The iPhone 17 Air will feature the thinnest and lightest design, with a new display size, a titanium frame, and a revamped camera bar.\n- Apple will likely replace the iPhone 17 Plus with the iPhone 17 Air, as consumers have shown the least interest in the former model.\n- The iPhone 17 may adopt a smaller \"metalens\" technology that allows the Face ID sensor and Dynamic Island module to take up less space on the display. This also allows Apple to shrink the phone's bezels and increase the screen size to 6.3 inches.\n- Only the iPhone 17 Pro models will have a new scratch-resistant, antireflective display panel. Like Apple's nanotexture offerings for MacBooks and iPads, it may come at an extra cost.\n- The iPhone 17 Pro models will feature a new 48-megapixel telephoto camera that can capture at 8x optical zoom (up from 5x).\nAlso: iPhone 17 Rumors: Latest News and Leaks - CNET\nThe expected color options are:\n- iPhone 17: Black, White, Steel Gray, Green, Purple, and Light Blue\n- iPhone 17 Air: Black, White, Light Blue, and Light Gold\n- iPhone 17 Pro: Black, White, Gray, Dark Blue, and Orange\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: Black, White, Gray, Dark Blue, and Orange\nBottom line: Buy now or wait?\nIf you need a new phone immediately and cannot wait up to two months, you should buy an iPhone 16 (or other existing model) right now. The iPhone 16's current features, including an A18 chip that can power Apple Intelligence tools, Action Button, Camera Control, and Wi-Fi 7 support, will remain relevant for years to come, so you're not missing out on much by opting for last year's model. There's also a good chance that you'll find a deal or price drop on the iPhone 16 today.\nAlso: We tested iOS 26 on the iPhone 16 Pro - these 5 features make the update worthwhile\nIf you're in less of a hurry, wait until September to see what Apple has to offer with the iPhone 17 series. Perhaps the iPhone 17 Aiir/Slim model will appeal to you more than expected, or Apple introduces a camera feature that solves one of your biggest pain points. Just be prepared for anything to happen, including a higher price across the board -- or none at all.\nWhen is the iPhone 17 event?\nApple has traditionally held its iPhone launch event on the second Tuesday of September, the week after Labor Day. If that holds true this year, we can expect the keynote to happen on September 9, with preorders and public availability soon to follow."

Google's latest Pixel 10 Pro phone has an upgraded Tensor G5 processor, which makes it more powerful than any Pixel phone ever. If you have an older Pixel, you may wonder if the new flagship is worth the upgrade and why.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nThe Pixel 10 lineup is the first to get Pixelsnap wireless charging, which is Google's response to Apple's MagSafe on the iPhone. While older Pixel phones supported wireless charging, the Pixelsnap features strong magnets to hold accessories like a battery pack or wallet.\nThis is just one of the many changes coming with the Pixel 10 Pro. Here's how the new flagship compares to previous models, including the Pixel 9 Pro, 8 Pro, 7 Pro, and 6 Pro.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 9 Pro\nThe Pixel 10 Pro's biggest upgrade is its performance, as it features a pretty significant performance boost compared to the 9 Pro. The new Google Tensor G5 processor features a more efficient 3nm process node and can deliver up to 36% faster performance than the Pixel 9 Pro. Both models have the same camera 50MP main camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens camera.\nAlso: Google Pixel phones just got a major Bluetooth connectivity upgrade - why 6.0 is such a big deal\nIf you have a Google Pixel 9 Pro, you may find that the new 10 Pro doesn't show much of a physical change. The current flagship has some new features, but it's more of an iterative upgrade to the previous model than anything else, with almost identical dimensions and a similar design.\nIf you're wondering whether upgrading to a Pixel 10 Pro from the previous model, the magnetic Pixelsnap wireless charging may make it worthwhile.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 8 Pro\nThe notable Tensor G5 processor will make the most difference in the 10 Pro's performance compared to the Pixel 8 Pro, but the new flagship also features a brighter display, improved battery, and an upgraded selfie camera.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nThe Pixel 8 Pro's rear camera set is the same as the new 10 Pro, but the front-facing camera is a big upgrade, going from 10.5MP to a 42MP sensor. The display on the new flagship supports a higher peak brightness, going from the 8 Pro's 2,400 nits to 3,300 nits.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro has 16GB of RAM, an increase from the 12GB in the 8 Pro, to boost its day-to-day performance a bit more.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 7 Pro\nThe older the Pixel model you have, the bigger the upgrade the Pixel 10 Pro represents. Compared to the Pixel 7 Pro, the 10 Pro features a brighter, more resistant display, a better camera array, support for Wi-Fi 7, and faster, more capable performance.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nThe Tensor G5 is undoubtedly a major upgrade from the Pixel 7 Pro's Tensor G2, giving the 10 Pro a noticeable difference in everyday use. This, along with bringing the RAM from 12GB to 16GB, should deliver snappier performance and the ability to run AI tasks with more ease.\nWhile the Pixel 10 Pro doesn't feature a complete overhaul of the full camera array that you've come to love in the Pixel 7 Pro, it does have some huge improvements. The Pixel 10 Pro's rear triple camera system adds a 48MP telephoto lens to what used to be a dual-camera system in the 7 Pro. The new flagship's ultrawide camera has a 48MP sensor that outshines the 7 Pro's 12MP sensor, and the front-facing camera goes from 10.8MP to 42MP.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 6 Pro\nComing from the Pixel 6 Pro to a Pixel 10 Pro is a no-brainer and will deliver the biggest upgrade for users. The camera array alone is fully updated, with more powerful sensors that have higher sensitivity -- not to mention the set of more recent Pixel-exclusive photography software features to upgrade your experience from capturing to editing.\nAlso: I compared the new $130 Pixel Buds to Apple, Sony and Bose - here's how Google wins\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro's new Tensor G5 processor is the best Pixel chipset available and a massive upgrade from the Pixel 6 Pro's original Tensor chip. If you're a Pixel 6 Pro user, this means you'll see a cleaner, snappier performance with the new smartphone.\nThe 6 Pro has an 800-nit peak brightness, which is only a fraction of the Pixel 10 Pro's 3,300 nits of peak brightness. As far as protection, the new 10 Pro has the Gorilla Glass Victus 2, a newer finish than the 6 Pro's Gorilla Glass Victus."

How they compare\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Pixel Buds 2a are Google's newest midrange earbuds.\n- Solid features for less than top competitors.\n- Big upgrades in battery, durability, and connectivity.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nTo complement the premium Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google's latest midrange earbuds, the Pixel Buds 2a, aim to offer a near-premium experience for $100 less. The Pixel Buds 2a borrow some of their premium sibling's best features and boast major upgrades over the first-generation A-series earbuds.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nAt $130, the Pixel Buds 2a aren't the cheapest earbuds on the market, but they make meaningful strides over their similarly priced competitors. Here's a brief overview of how they stack up to Apple, Bose, and Sony.\nBattery life\nCompared to their predecessor, the Pixel Buds 2a promise up to five more hours of continuous listening time, depending on whether active noise cancellation (ANC) is enabled. With the charging case, they promise 27 hours of total listening time.\nLooking at competitors in similar tiers, the Pixel Buds 2a beat the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, Sony LinkBuds Fit, and Apple AirPods 4 in continuous playtime. However, the AirPods 4 charging case promises three more hours with ANC disabled.\nMicrophones\nThe Pixel Buds 2a sport four microphones, two in each earbud. These microphones aid in noise cancellation and voice pickup for hands-free calling. Sony's midrange LinkBuds Fit have the same microphone lineup, while Bose and Apple's midrange earbuds have one more mic.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nHowever, Google's secret to ensuring the buds' tiny, rounded form factor still achieves superb voice pickup and quality noise cancellation lies in its custom Tensor A1 chip, the same audio processor in the Pixel Buds Pro 2.\nRelying on microphones alone, the traditional bud-and-stem design typically produces better voice pickup due to more earbud real estate and a microphone pointing toward your mouth.\nGoogle's chip was designed with AI-powered noise processing in mind, aiming to make the Pixel Buds a tiny yet mighty pair of earbuds. The Pixel Buds 2a are also equipped with Bluetooth Super Wideband, a technology that builds on the Bluetooth hands-free protocol and allows you to take and make calls with your earbuds.\nSuper Wideband expands the bandwidth for calling over Bluetooth, resulting in clearer, more natural-sounding speech.\nDust and water resistance\nCompared to the first-generation A-series buds with an IPX4 rating, the Buds 2a have an improved IP54 dust and water ingress rating. Although water resistance is usually the star of the earbuds show, increased dust resistance means your earbuds are safer from solid particles like dust, sand, or hair.\nAlso: Google just settled the foldable phone debate with one number - and I hope Samsung is watching\nSony's LinkBuds Fit and Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds sport an IPX4 rating, while Google's Pixel Buds 2a and Apple's AirPods 4 have an IP54 rating. The first number indicates dust resistance, and the second number indicates water resistance.\nAlthough IP54 doesn't mean your earbuds are completely dustproof or waterproof, it does mean that the earbuds can keep out enough dust to avoid interference with performance.\nThe Google Pixel Buds 2a are available for preorder in Iris and Hazel."

Although I've been mostly satisfied with the experience, there have been issues that left something to be desired with versions 1 and 2. The latest iteration, however, has solved those issues and has finally proved that the Pixel Watch is a contender in the smartwatch market.\nIf you're unsure about upgrading to the Pixel Watch 3, let me offer five reasons why I'm glad I made the jump from the Pixel Watch 2.\n1. Battery life\nBattery life on the Pixel Watch 2 wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great. I was lucky to get 24 hours from a single charge, and that's with the watch going into bedtime mode from 9:30 PM to 7:30 AM. By the time morning arrived, the battery would often have between 10% to 15% left... and that's only if I'd gone for a short run on the previous day. On Saturdays, I do a 13-mile run and inevitably the battery would be dead sometime before Sunday morning.\nAlso: Google Pixel Watch 3: Key specs, features, price, and everything else you need to know\nSince I opted for the larger version of the Pixel Watch 3, I can now wake up with nearly 50% of my battery remaining (on short-run days) and between 20% to 30% on long-run days. That's a huge change. Although I don't wake up with an alarm (other than one of my cats being vocal), I always check my watch to see what time it is. If the watch battery dies in the middle of the night, I'm out of luck.\nThank you, Google.\n2. Bigger display\nMy eyes aren't what they used to be, and the Pixel Watch 2's small display has been getting harder and harder to see without my glasses. When on a run, I'd have to squint to just barely be able to see my pace and heart rate.\nWith the 45mm Pixel Watch 3, that's no longer the case. Although I do still have to squint a bit to read notifications, it's still not nearly as bad as it was with the previous iteration.\nThere are some watch faces that aren't exactly friendly to aging eyes, but most of them are a vast improvement over the previous takes (especially with the 45mm version). Of course, the bigger screen also allows for more information to be displayed, but how much, of course, depends on the watch face you use.\n3. Running splits\nBack when I used a Samsung watch, one of my favorite features was the running splits. Essentially, the watch would call out times for each mile run. Although my times are getting slower and slower with each passing year, I still like to see where I am at.\nThis is especially helpful during my 13-mile runs, so I can pace myself. Running a too-fast pace on a longer outing can make for a painful end, but now that the Pixel Watch includes splits, I don't have to worry about it. It also helps me clock miles if I'm running an unfamiliar route. Every time the watch vibrates, I know another mile has passed. The Pixel Watch 2 did not include this feature, and it was greatly missed.\n4. Smoother animations\nOne of my issues with the previous Pixel Watches was that the animations were bad. Swiping from tile to tile or scrolling through notifications was often a jumpy, jarring experience. Given the cost of those devices, you'd think Google would have ensured the UI worked as smoothly as possible. This is especially so, given how smooth the Apple Watch animations are.\nWell, the third time's the charm, and the Pixel Watch 3 animations are buttery smooth.\n5. Better performance\nI'd become used to the sluggish performance of the Pixel Watch 2, to the point that when I first started using the Pixel Watch 3, I was shocked at how much better it performed. My first thought was, \"This is how the Pixel Watch should have performed all along!\" The days of poorly performing Google smartwatches are over, and the Pixel Watch 3 has (once again) made me a believer.\nAlso: Hands-on with the Pixel Watch 3: The three features Google got right\nI will say, however, that the 45mm Pixel Watch does have a leg ahead over the 41mm watch. The latest Pixel Watch features the same CPU and coprocessor as the Pixel 2. Also, it includes the same amount of RAM and storage. Part of the reason for the improved performance is that the Pixel Watch 3 has a dynamic refresh rate (from 1Hz to 60Hz), whereas the Pixel Watch 2 had a fixed 60Hz refresh rate. My guess is that WearOS 5 also helps.\nWhatever Google has done, I find the difference between the Pixel Watch 2 and the Pixel Watch 3 to be clear. Some might not find the difference to be all that obvious, but for those who really look for such things, it's there, thanks to the sum total of all the constituent pieces that come together to make the best watch Google has produced to date.\nYou can purchase a Pixel Watch 3 from the official Google Store. The 41mm version runs $350 and the 45mm version runs $400."

That's because of the extra convenience I get with my Mac Mini and a bunch of MagSafe-compatible chargers, power banks, and other travel accessories.\nI always have second thoughts about shifting to Android because it would hinder my workflow and require new backpack accessories. But the Google Pixel 10 is the first smartphone in months that I'm considering dropping iOS for.\nAlso: Camera Coach on Pixel 10 helps you take better photos as you shoot them\nIf you've been on the fence about switching from an iPhone, the new Pixel 10 phones are the best alternatives you can buy right now. The Pixel 10 seems like the perfect Android phone to switch to. Here are three features that have sold this iPhone user on the Pixel 10.\n1. PixelSnap is a long-awaited addition\nWhen I first shifted from my iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 16e, I thought I'd miss ProMotion the most, but it was MagSafe that had made its mark over the years. I realized how dependent I was on MagSafe when I couldn't use any of those accessories with Apple's budget phone.\nI'm more confident about switching to the new Google Pixel 10 because it will not make my MagSafe accessories ineffective.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nThe Google Pixel 10 series includes a new feature called PixelSnap, a Qi2-based MagSafe alternative for Android. This means, theoretically, I can use my new Baseus PicoGo 5,000mAh power bank, Shiftcam SnapStand Max, and more without any issues.\nThese are some of my travel essentials, and I won't need to purchase separate on-the-go accessories just because I got a new phone. The addition of PixelSnap is my favorite upgrade on the new Pixels.\n2. Smarter voice assistant\nApple Intelligence hasn't been up to the mark, at least for me. While Visual Intelligence is useful, I prefer Samsung's Galaxy AI suite of features on my Galaxy Z Fold 7. Moreover, I've been using Gemini Live more than expected and way more than I have ever used Siri on my iPhone.\nWhile Siri can't get reminders right or call my contacts in one go, Gemini Live has helped me organize my room and solve daily life problems. It is now getting support for more Google apps like Keep and Maps. So, I can add my thoughts to Google Keep without needing to touch my phone. Since I use Google apps in my workflow, Gemini makes things easier and more intuitive.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nWhile I can access Gemini on my iPhone without any issues, Google's new Pixel-exclusive AI features make a strong case for switching. I'm looking forward to experiencing the new Magic Cue -- which is supposed to deliver more personalized and contextual AI -- and Camera Coach, which is touted to help compose shots better.\n3. Telephoto camera on the base model\nThe base iPhone 16 doesn't have a telephoto camera, whereas the iPhone 16 Pro sports a comparatively small 5x periscope sensor. I've used the latter, and it struggles in low light. To compare, the Google Pixel 10 Pro features a larger sensor with 5x optical zoom, and the base Pixel 10 also gets an additional zoom lens with the same optical zoom.\nI'm not expecting exceptional zoom quality from the Pixel 10's telephoto camera because it is a smaller sensor. However, it should be better than the iPhone 16's 5x digital zoom. I like shooting architecture photos, and having 5x optical zoom on a $799 phone is a welcome addition.\nAlso: Why I recommend this $400 Google Pixel over competing models from Samsung and OnePlus\nApart from these three features, I'm also looking forward to going back to the Pixel for all the Google extras. From fun features like Add Me and Best Take to useful Circle to Search and Magic Eraser, all of them add to the Google Pixel experience. While I'm not a fan of comparatively thicker bezels, the Pixel 10's brighter and stronger display is another nice-to-have addition that should make the experience better."

      "text": "Google just teased its new flagship phone early - Here's what we've gathered\nThe next Made by Google event isn't until next month, but Google has spilled the beans early by officially unveiling the Pixel 10. The Google Store has been updated with a new header video showing off the upcoming smartphone. The short clip only displays the device from a single angle, but still manages to reveal quite a lot.\nAlso: The best Google Pixel phones to buy in 2025\nThe Pixel 10 bears a striking resemblance to the Pixel 9, sporting the same isolated camera island on the back. We saw only a single color option in the video -- a matte gray with a shiny border. A recent leak states that the phone will be available in four colors: Obsidian (black), Indigo (blue), Frost (light gray), and Limoncello (a yellowish-green). It appears that Google revealed Frost in the teaser.\nIf you look closely, you'll notice three lenses peering from behind the glass. It's possible we're looking at the Pixel 10 Pro since the Pro models have three lenses. However, recent rumors claim that the base model will also have a triple camera setup.\nNew camera tech\nUsing the Pixel 9 Pro as an example, it's possible the Pixel 10 will have a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto option. That last camera could be something special. According to a June report from Android Headlines, Google is adding a macro functionality to the 5x telephoto sensor, turning it into a \"Tele-Macro\" lens.\nThis combination will apparently improve macro photography by allowing users to be further away from a subject. It is also said to improve the overall quality. Whether or not this Tele-Macro will be present on every Pixel 10 model (or if it's even real in the first place) is unknown.\nAssuming that this is the base Pixel 10, it is very possible that the other rumors are, at the very least, somewhat correct. The future smartphone will not be a complete overhaul of the previous generation. Instead, it will be a refinement of the series, introducing upgrades in key areas, such as the new Tensor G5 chipset to improve performance.\nIf you're ready for an upgrade and want to get your hands on the Pixel 10, Google is offering an exclusive offer to anyone who signs up for email notifications. On August 20, you'll receive a promotional coupon code and instructions on how to redeem it in order to get a discount on a \"specified Google Pixel 10 device\".\nExactly how much the discount will be or which Pixel 10 model is eligible are unknown at the time of this writing, but it's likely to be around $100, similar to what we saw last year with the Pixel 9.\nMade By Google 2025 kicks off on August 20 at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST, and we're likely to see Google unveil more than just new phones. Specifically the new Google Pixel Watch 4 -- the next smartwatch in the lineup -- and new Pixel Buds Pro.\nLooking for the next best product?

Google's latest Pixel 10 Pro phone has an upgraded Tensor G5 processor, which makes it more powerful than any Pixel phone ever. If you have an older Pixel, you may wonder if the new flagship is worth the upgrade and why.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nThe Pixel 10 lineup is the first to get Pixelsnap wireless charging, which is Google's response to Apple's MagSafe on the iPhone. While older Pixel phones supported wireless charging, the Pixelsnap features strong magnets to hold accessories like a battery pack or wallet.\nThis is just one of the many changes coming with the Pixel 10 Pro. Here's how the new flagship compares to previous models, including the Pixel 9 Pro, 8 Pro, 7 Pro, and 6 Pro.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 9 Pro\nThe Pixel 10 Pro's biggest upgrade is its performance, as it features a pretty significant performance boost compared to the 9 Pro. The new Google Tensor G5 processor features a more efficient 3nm process node and can deliver up to 36% faster performance than the Pixel 9 Pro. Both models have the same camera 50MP main camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens camera.\nAlso: Google Pixel phones just got a major Bluetooth connectivity upgrade - why 6.0 is such a big deal\nIf you have a Google Pixel 9 Pro, you may find that the new 10 Pro doesn't show much of a physical change. The current flagship has some new features, but it's more of an iterative upgrade to the previous model than anything else, with almost identical dimensions and a similar design.\nIf you're wondering whether upgrading to a Pixel 10 Pro from the previous model, the magnetic Pixelsnap wireless charging may make it worthwhile.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 8 Pro\nThe notable Tensor G5 processor will make the most difference in the 10 Pro's performance compared to the Pixel 8 Pro, but the new flagship also features a brighter display, improved battery, and an upgraded selfie camera.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nThe Pixel 8 Pro's rear camera set is the same as the new 10 Pro, but the front-facing camera is a big upgrade, going from 10.5MP to a 42MP sensor. The display on the new flagship supports a higher peak brightness, going from the 8 Pro's 2,400 nits to 3,300 nits.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro has 16GB of RAM, an increase from the 12GB in the 8 Pro, to boost its day-to-day performance a bit more.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 7 Pro\nThe older the Pixel model you have, the bigger the upgrade the Pixel 10 Pro represents. Compared to the Pixel 7 Pro, the 10 Pro features a brighter, more resistant display, a better camera array, support for Wi-Fi 7, and faster, more capable performance.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nThe Tensor G5 is undoubtedly a major upgrade from the Pixel 7 Pro's Tensor G2, giving the 10 Pro a noticeable difference in everyday use. This, along with bringing the RAM from 12GB to 16GB, should deliver snappier performance and the ability to run AI tasks with more ease.\nWhile the Pixel 10 Pro doesn't feature a complete overhaul of the full camera array that you've come to love in the Pixel 7 Pro, it does have some huge improvements. The Pixel 10 Pro's rear triple camera system adds a 48MP telephoto lens to what used to be a dual-camera system in the 7 Pro. The new flagship's ultrawide camera has a 48MP sensor that outshines the 7 Pro's 12MP sensor, and the front-facing camera goes from 10.8MP to 42MP.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 6 Pro\nComing from the Pixel 6 Pro to a Pixel 10 Pro is a no-brainer and will deliver the biggest upgrade for users. The camera array alone is fully updated, with more powerful sensors that have higher sensitivity -- not to mention the set of more recent Pixel-exclusive photography software features to upgrade your experience from capturing to editing.\nAlso: I compared the new $130 Pixel Buds to Apple, Sony and Bose - here's how Google wins\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro's new Tensor G5 processor is the best Pixel chipset available and a massive upgrade from the Pixel 6 Pro's original Tensor chip. If you're a Pixel 6 Pro user, this means you'll see a cleaner, snappier performance with the new smartphone.\nThe 6 Pro has an 800-nit peak brightness, which is only a fraction of the Pixel 10 Pro's 3,300 nits of peak brightness. As far as protection, the new 10 Pro has the Gorilla Glass Victus 2, a newer finish than the 6 Pro's Gorilla Glass Victus."

This deal applies to all color options except Peony (pink).\nI had a chance to attend the Made by Google event back in August 2024, and after the keynote wrapped up, I was more excited to go hands-on with the baseline version of the Pixel 9 than the Pro or the Pro XL. Why? Because the Pixel 9's accessibility makes it a fascinating device, and one I recommend for a handful of reasons.\nAlso: I changed 10 settings on my Pixel phone to significantly improve the user experience\nI'm spoiling this review right at the top, but it's true. Google's latest entry-level flagship, the Pixel 9, is here, with prices starting at $799. Even though its hardware is a minor improvement over the Pixel 8, it's an impressive phone overall. It offers a new design, slightly upgraded performance, slightly better cameras, a slightly bigger battery, and a host of new AI features.\nGoogle has positioned the Pixel 9 as the default Android alternative to the iPhone 16, partly because it looks like one. Google gave the entire Pixel 9 family flat sides with rounded corners, which makes it look like something from a design lab in Cupertino. The good news is that it makes these phones look and feel great.\nIn fact, they're my favorite-looking Pixel phones yet. The Pixel 9 feels especially unique while still offering a premium feel that's blissfully cold to the touch when you pick it up. The sides are aluminum, while the front and back feature Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The whole thing is IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, and it's just the right size for use with one hand.\nAnother characteristic of the Pixel is its nice display, and the Pixel 9 definitely has one. It features a 6.3-inch Actua display that is a tenth of an inch bigger than the Pixel 8. The sharp 2424x1080 resolution, OLED panel, and 120Hz dynamic refresh rate give the Pixel 9 exceptional visuals, whether you're just reading email or watching your favorite movie. This year, the screen can reach way up to 2,700 nits of brightness, making it one of the brightest Android phones you can buy.\nAlso: I replaced my Pixel 9 Pro XL with the 9a for a month - and it was pretty dang close\nAlso, its performance feels better. Powered by the new Tensor G4 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of storage, the Pixel 9 is a screamer. It's one of the most responsive Android phones I've used all year, and that's just with the standard version of this phone.\nThe cameras are also impressive. Google kept the same 50MP main camera as last year but swapped the old 12MP ultra-wide for a new 48MP 123-degree camera. Photos are simply stunning on this phone, and Google's post-processing algorithms do a great job of retaining details and contrast. Video quality is also very good, especially with the company's Video Boost technology. This phone can easily rival any device that costs $200+ more.\nIf there's a downside to the hardware, it's the inclusion of the lower-quality 10.5MP selfie camera, whereas the Pro phones get a new 42MP camera. There's also an extra telephoto camera on the Pro model, so you won't get the same zoom quality on the regular Pixel 9.\nRegarding this phone's AI features, Google has jammed quite a bit into the Pixel 9. Not only does it ship with the company's Gemini chatbot out of the box, but thanks to the Tensor G4 processor, it also comes with Gemini Live, so you can have real-life conversations with it.\nAlso: I found a physical keyboard for my Pixel 9 Pro that isn't a joke\nIt requires a Google One AI Premium plan, but you'll get one for free if you buy a Pixel 9. I've asked it numerous questions that were similar to web queries (\"What's the best place to live near New York City that's relatively affordable,\" \"How many stars are in the sky -- wait, in the galaxy?\") and it answered them all with ease -- even with speech interruptions. It's in the early stages, but it's exciting technology that could change how we use our phones.\nYou also get features like Add Me, which allows you to take a picture of your friends, then have them take a picture of you in the same place, and merge the two so no one's left out. I've played around with it during my testing, which worked surprisingly well. There are also some nice updates to Magic Editor for framing your photos.\nGoogle also included two new AI-powered apps on the Pixel 9 series: Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio. With the former, you can organize your screenshots and search through them with AI prompts, allowing you to easily reference information like Wi-Fi passwords or recipes.\nMeanwhile, the latter lets you generate images on the fly and customize them with text, stickers, and other effects. I've enjoyed using both apps in my limited testing time, but I'll need to play with them over the long run to see whether they're worth it.\nAlso: The best Google Pixel phones to buy in 2025\nI found battery life to be quite good. There's a 4,700mAh cell inside that can last all day on a charge and then some, which means you won't need to worry about this phone's battery after a long day. Google includes 45W charging support on the Pixel 9 series, which is awesome, but you'll need to buy a separate wall adapter to take advantage of it. In addition, there's 15W wireless charging (not Qi2, notably) and 5W reverse wireless charging called \"Battery Share.\"\nZDNET's buying advice\nIf your budget is $800, it's hard not to recommend Google's Pixel 9, especially while it's on sale at $250 off. Sure, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a tough competitor, but I actually think this is the better buy. It gives you access to some useful new AI features, and you get all the perks of the Pixel experience, like excellent software, display quality, and cameras.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL models may be flashier, but the baseline version of Google's flagship phone should not be overlooked.\nThis article was originally published on August 22, 2024, and was updated on June 6, 2025\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nCNET: Tariff Pricing Tracker: We're Watching 11 Products You Might Need to Buy\nSmartphones are among the most affected by the new US tariffs, with devices imported from China and Vietnam facing steep duties that could raise retail prices by 20% or more. Brands like Apple and Google, which rely heavily on Asian manufacturing, may either pass these costs on to consumers or absorb them at the expense of profit margins.\nThe tariffs could also lead to delays in product launches or shifts in where and how phones are made, forcing companies to diversify production to countries with more favorable trade conditions."

If you want to try this update but are hesitant because you've noticed your Android phone or tablet already feels too sluggish, clearing app and browser caches can give it a fresh boost and free up some storage space.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nOver time, cached data can accumulate, become corrupted, or simply get outdated, which may slow down your device. Restarting your phone often helps, but a targeted cache-clear is a quick way to boost responsiveness without upgrading hardware.\nIn this guide, I'll show you how to clear cached data on Android. If you're an Apple user, here's how to clear the cache on an iPhone.\nHow to clear cached data from Android apps\nWhat you'll need: Any Android device. The exact steps may vary slightly by manufacturer, but the general process remains the same.\n1. See all the apps installed on your Android device\nOpen Settings, go to Storage, and tap Apps. If you don't see a dedicated Apps entry, use the search area in Settings to quickly find it.\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Android phone to give it an instant battery boost\nAlso in the Storage menu, some Android devices now include a \"Free up space\" suggestion via the Google Files app. To use this, open Files, tap the three-line menu in the top-left, and select Clean. Review each suggestion (e.g. unused apps, large files, duplicates) and follow the steps to delete any files you no longer need.\n2. Clear cache for individual apps\nTap an app you've installed (avoid system services), then select \"Storage and cache,\" and tap \"Clear cache.\" Don't tap \"Clear storage\" unless you want to reset the app completely.\nAlso: I changed 10 Samsung phone settings to instantly improve the user experience\n3. Repeat for other apps\nRepeat for any apps that use a lot of space. You can start with data-heavy hogs like social apps or streaming services.\nAlso: How to factory reset your Android phone without unlocking it\nAlso, while you're in the Apps menu, some Android versions make it easy to see which apps take up the most space. Simply look for the three-dot menu in the top-right corner and select Sort by Size.\nNote: Some Android phones may have a built-in clear all cache option available. Under Settings > Storage > and App Cache, look for a 'Select All' button at the top.\nHow to clear cache from Chrome\nWhat you need: The Chrome app on your Android 16 device.\n1. Go to History settings in Chrome\nOpen Chrome, tap the three-dot menu > History > Clear browsing data.\n2. Choose the data you want to delete\nSelect the time range and check \"Cached images and files\" (and any other data you wish to remove). Then tap \"Clear data.\"\nAlso: My 7 favorite new Android 16 features include delights for every Pixel user\nEach option explains what it does and how it affects your experience. For example, clearing cookies and site data will log you out of many or all websites, while clearing cached images and files might cause Chrome to load images slower next time you visit a site.\n3. Optional: A simpler shortcut\nOn newer versions of Chrome for Android, tapping the menu button displays an option called Clear Browsing Data. When you select this, a pop-up will appear asking you to clear browsing data from a specific period. If you select More Options, you'll be taken to the Browsing Data screen, where you can choose the data to delete and select the time range.\nFAQ\nWhat does cached data mean?\nCache stores temporary files -- like images, scripts, and other resources -- to speed up apps and websites. Clearing it removes these files without affecting personal settings or login credentials.\nAlso: How to clear your TV cache (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)\nFor example, in the Facebook app, cached data might include profile pictures, photos, and videos. Deleting cached data from the Facebook app will remove these temporary files on your device, but won't log you out.\nWill clearing cache delete my app data?\nNo. Clearing cache only removes temporary files. Your accounts, settings, and app data remain intact.\nWill clearing cache make my device faster?\nYes. It frees up storage and removes potentially corrupted or outdated files, which can resolve slowdowns and glitches.\nHow often should I clear cache?\nWhenever you notice slowdowns or app glitches. For most users, every three to six months is sufficient.\nAlso: I made 5 simple changes on Android to instantly make my phone sound better\nIs clearing cache only for storage?\nClearing cache can also fix app issues by forcing apps to rebuild their temporary files. It's a quick troubleshooting step, not just a storage cleanup.\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2023. It was fact-checked and thoroughly updated on August 15, 2025 to reflect the new Android 16 update.\nLooking for the next best product? Get expert reviews and editor favorites with ZDNET Recommends."

With advanced features such as voice assistants, crash detection, call and text support, and long battery lives, modern smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra 2 or the Google Pixel Watch are far more than just an accessory. Thanks to powerful sensors they've become one of the most popular health and fitness trackers, too.\nYour smartphone may limit your smartwatch choice, but there are affordable smartwatches from Garmin, Withings, and others from Amazfit that offer more limited application support priced in the $250 to $500 range.\nBest smartwatch deals of the week\n- $200 (save $100)\n- $500 (save $150)\n- $359 (save $70)\n- $200 (save $100)\nWhat is the best smartwatch right now?\nBased on my extensive hands-on testing and insights from experts, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is my pick for the best smartwatch overall due to its powerful processor, long battery life, third-party application support, storage capacity, high-quality titanium materials, sleep-tracking capabilities, women's wellness features, and advanced workout metric feature suite. If you're not an Apple user, read on to see how watches from Samsung (including its newest Galaxy Watch Ultra), Google (including its newest Pixel Watch 3), Garmin, Withings, and Amazfit compare to find the best smartwatch for your needs and your wrist.\nAlso: The best sports watches you can buy\nThe best smartwatches of 2025\nThe Apple Watch maintained the same form factor and basic design for eight years, but all of that changed in 2022 when Apple released the radical new Apple Watch Ultra, built and optimized for the outdoor adventurer. The Ultra 2 builds on the Ultra with a new processor, a much brighter display, twice the storage capacity, and the use of recycled titanium materials. Apple also announced a matte black titanium Ultra 2 this year, with all of the same specifications and performance as the 2023 model.\nAlso: Apple Watch Ultra 2 vs. Watch Ultra: Is it time to upgrade?\nWhy we like it: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the most rugged and capable Apple Watch to date and offers a bright, flat 49mm display made of scratch-resistant sapphire glass and 3000 nits maximum brightness. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is larger than the Series 10, but the titanium case helps keep the weight down, and it is far lighter than competing sports watches.\nApple's WatchOS 10 launched with APIs for custom workouts, and third parties have released new versions of applications to support this advanced training functionality. We tested the TrainingPeaks integration and this capability is a serious shot across the bow of dedicated GPS sports watches. WatchOS 11 brought even more to challenge legacy sports watches with training load, a Vitals app to inform your readiness, sleep apnea detection, and a customizable Summary tab in the Apple Fitness app on your iPhone.\nWho it's for: Beyond the build quality and advanced training functions, no other smartwatch supports as many applications and utilities as an Apple Watch, clearly making it the best smartwatch available today. Its capability to serve as a primary means of communication also makes it tough to beat.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you are not an iPhone user, then don't even consider an Apple Watch Ultra 2 since it doesn't connect to an iPad or MacOS computer. There are great options from Google and Samsung if you own an Android smartphone.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 tech specs: Display: 49mm, 410 x 502 pixels OLED sapphire glass | Battery life: 36 hours | Dimensions: 49 x 44 x 14.4mm | Weight: 61.3 g | Water/Dust resistance: 100m with IP6X | LTE cellular option: Yes\nWhy we like it: The Apple Watch Series 10 looks similar to the Series 9, but improves the user experience with narrower black borders, larger displays, and a much thinner form factor, making it the thinnest Apple Watch ever. Despite the reduction in thickness, the Apple Watch Series 10 still functions for more than a day, and now it charges up much more quickly so you can top it off while you get ready for the day.\nAlong with an improved display, the Series 10 also gets a new processor. For the first time, buyers can also choose a glossy jet black color aluminum watch that has a 30-step anodization process for a stylish and classy look.\nAlso: I replaced my Apple Watch Ultra with the 46mm Series 10 for a month, and it's surprisingly capable\nWho it's for: Sleep apnea is a condition that is very common today, yet it is reported that 80% of the cases are undiagnosed. The Apple Watch Series 10 can help indicate whether or not you should seek medical evaluation for the condition. If sleep apnea is not treated, it can lead to hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiac issues.\nAlso, like the Apple Watch Ultra 2, the Series 10 watches now support the integrated water temperature and depth utility that can turn on automatically as you enter the water. A Tides app is also available to help you track conditions for more than 115,000 beaches and surfing areas around the world. The lack of a precision start for GPS tracking is a limitation preventing me from selecting the Series 10 as my primary smartwatch.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you are not an iPhone user, then don't even consider an Apple Watch Series 10 since it doesn't connect to an iPad or MacOS computer. There are great options from Google and Samsung if you own an Android smartphone. If you want a more rugged Apple Watch, consider the Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nApple Watch Series 10 tech specs: Display: 416 x 496 pixels (46mm) and 374 x 446 pixels (42mm) OLED | Battery life: 18 hours | Dimensions: 46 x 39 x 9.7mm (46mm) and 42 x 36 x9.7mm (42mm) | Weight: 36.4 grams (AL 46mm) and 30 g (AL 42mm) | Water/Dust resistance: 50m with IP6X | LTE cellular option: Yes\nWhy we like it: Google's third-generation Pixel Watch 3 is sure to please the masses with two size options, improved displays, and software enhancements that provide a richer user experience. This watch integrates several Fitbit features, including improved heart rate sensors and GPS tracking, making it secretly the best watch available for both Fitbit and Google Pixel fans.\nWho it's for: Google incorporated a running workout builder that gathers your health data over a two-week period and then creates a program that adapts to your data regularly. Real-time guidance is provided as you run, advanced metrics are tracked and then Google shows you how to improve the metrics, a Daily Readiness Score is provided even if you are not a Fitbit Premium subscriber, and Cardio/Target load features are available. The Cardio and Target load features may even trump some of the best sports watches.\nBottom line: If you're a Fitbit fan and are looking for the latest and greatest Fitbit in a watch form factor, then the Google Pixel Watch 3 is the wearable for you. If you also enjoy Google's take on wearables and want years of updates, then this is the watch to consider.\nOne of the best functions of the Pixel Watch 3 that even beats out the Apple Watch is the focus on safety. While the Apple Watch can appear in your Find My application, and you can share your location with family and friends, that's a passive setting that requires people to physically check the app to find you. The Pixel 3's Safety Check feature allows you to set a check-in timer whenever you're moving from point A to B and want your emergency contacts to be notified if anything goes wrong -- the most reliable feature I've seen on any wearable I've tested. It also supports immediate emergency alerts/SOS and fall detection alerts, similar to the latest Apple Watches.\nThe new Loss of Pulse Detection feature is available for US owners. This feature has the potential to save lives and I look forward to hearing of success stories soon since my own father could have possibly been saved by this feature.\nReview: Hands-on with the Pixel Watch 3: The three features Google got right\nWho should look elsewhere: If you use an iPhone, don't even think about the Pixel Watch 3. Google WearOS watches used to work with iOS, but that is no longer the case so you need an Android phone to use this watch. It's also not the best option for those looking for a rugged watch due to its proud display and minimalist form factor.\nGoogle Pixel Watch 3 tech specs: Display: 1.2-inch (41mm) and 1.45-inch (45mm) AMOLED | Battery life: 24 hours with AOD | Dimensions: 41 x 41 x 12.3mm and 45 x 45 x 12.3mm | Weight: 31 g (without band) and 37 g | Water/Dust resistance: 5 ATM/IP68 | LTE cellular option: Yes\nWhy we like it: Apple took a shot across the bow of serious GPS sports watch brands with the Apple Watch Ultra series, and now Samsung joins the party with the large Galaxy Watch Ultra. Samsung branded it the same way as Apple, along with a familiar orange button and waterproof silicone band. A few other advanced features found in Apple's model are present in the Samsung model, which is a great thing for Android phone owners, especially Samsung Galaxy phone owners.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a unique square design with a round watch face, an interesting magnetic lug system, three buttons on one side, gesture support, advanced running dynamics, and more. Samsung's Galaxy AI is present in the form of wellness insights that combine into a daily score to help guide you to optimal performance, including healthy sleep levels.\nReview: The Galaxy Watch Ultra convinced me to replace my Apple Watch in less than a week. Here's why\nWho it's for: The Watch Ultra runs the Samsung-powered Google Wear OS 5.0 with One UI Watch 6.0, meaning it still looks like a Samsung smartwatch, but also supports Google Assistant, Google Maps, Google Wallet, Google Play Store, and more Google apps.\nIt has an operating system optimized for the round watch design with a virtual rotating bezel. Fall detection, messaging, phone calls, and more are available on the watch, with advanced fitness data such as VO2 Max and advanced running dynamics data also supported.\nAt $649, it is the most expensive Samsung Galaxy watch, but it is still $150 less than Apple's competing Apple Watch Ultra 2. There are some fantastic deals available and solid trade-in options, so if you are considering this watch, make sure to check out the latest prices on Samsung's website.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you use an iPhone, don't even think about the Galaxy Watch Ultra. Google WearOS watches used to work with iOS, but that is no longer the case so you need an Android phone to use this watch. The Galaxy Watch Ultra is also a very large watch so if you have smaller wrists then consider the Galaxy Watch 8.\nGalaxy Watch Ultra tech specs: Display: 1.5 inch, 480 x 480 pixels Super AMOLED | Battery life: Two to three days | Dimensions: 47.4 x 47.1 x 12.1mm | Weight: 60.5 grams | Water resistance: 10 ATM+IP68 | LTE cellular option: Yes\nWhy we like it: Samsung's latest smartwatch for the masses, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, was unveiled along with the Galaxy Watch 8 at the July 2025 Unpacked event in New York. It brings back the physical rotating bezel along with a new cushion design inspired by the Galaxy Watch Ultra.\nIn addition to the bezel, this is the first WearOS watch that includes Google Gemini out of the box, so all of the power of Google's AI assistant is now on your wrist. Samsung's Galaxy AI is also included so you have a powerful companion available.\nWho it's for: The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is a lovely watch with advanced support for runners, with a Running Coach that's offered for free after you complete your running test. A dynamic running program guides you as you run so that you can maintain your heart rate or pace to achieve your goals.\nIf you want to closely manage your health, the Watch 8 Classic provides an antioxidant test, ECG, sleep apnea detection, body composition, and more so that you always know your key health and wellness metrics.\nAlso: I ran with Samsung's Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and it both humbled and motivated me\nWho should look elsewhere: If you use an iPhone, don't even think about the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. Google WearOS watches used to work with iOS, but that is no longer the case -- you need an Android phone to use this watch.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7 tech specs: Display: 1.34-inch 438x438 Super AMOLED | Battery life: Up to 40 hours | Dimensions: 46 x 46.4 x 10.6 mm | Weight: 63.5g | Water/Dust resistance: 5ATM | LTE cellular option: Yes\nWhy we like it: While millions own various smartwatches there are still millions more who have yet to discover the benefits of a smartwatch, but thanks to Kospet then you can pick up a new high quality smartwatch for $150 or less. The M3 Ultra 2 has a square form factor while the T3 Ultra 2 has a round form factor.\nWho it's for: The watches are made with quality materials, are attractive, have brilliant AMOLED touchscreen displays, provide accurate satellite positioning capability, and are some of the most affordable available in the market today. The integrated heart rate monitor is not as accurate as I hoped, but it does connect to external sensors for improved accuracy.\nThe smartphone companion app is well-designed and capable, with a customizable home screen, plenty of personalization options, third-party service connectivity, and much more. However, it did take several hours to update the firmware, with me repeatedly having to choose manual update in the app, so you may need to be patient with the updates.\nAlso: I found a tough smartwatch that won't break the bank - and it's not a Garmin\nWho should look elsewhere: If you want a smartwatch with extensive application support then the Kospet models are not for you and you should consider a Samsung, Google, or Apple Watch model.\nKospet T3 Ultra 2 tech specs: Display: 466 x 466 pixels OLED | Battery life: 35 hours | Dimensions: 48 x 48 x 13.7mm | Weight: 83.8 g | Water resistance: 5 ATM | LTE cellular option: No\nWhy we like it: The Venu X1 is the first Venu series watch to feature a LED flashlight, but more than that it has a massive 2-inch AMOLED square display in a sleek 7.9 mm thick body. It offers much of what we see in the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED, but for those of us who are not professional athletes and are looking for a Garmin-branded watch that looks a bit like an Apple Watch Ultra 2 or Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.\nWho it's for: The integrated speaker and microphone also supports calls from the wrist, voice commands, and access to voice assistants via a connected smartphone. In addition to its smartwatch functions, the Venu X1 supports all of the amazing Garmin functions and vast ecosystem. This includes subscription music support, Garmin Pay, Connect IQ app support, and the superb Garmin Connect smartphone application.\nReview: Garmin Venu X1\nWho should look elsewhere: There is no support for multi-band GPS and ECG measurements, but positioning with multiple satellite systems has still proven to be very accurate. If you want the most accurate positioning then you should consider a Forerunner or Fenix model.\nI've taken ECG measurements for testing on various watches, but my results are always normal so it has no actual utility for me so the lack of ECG is not important to me. However, millions can benefit from early detection so if you need the ECG capability then look to another Garmin model capable of this feature.\nGarmin Venu X1 features: Display: 390 x 390 pixels AMOLED Battery life (GPS): 16 hours | Dimensions: 41 x 46 x 7.9 mm | Weight: 34 grams (40 grams with ComfortFit band) | Water resistance: 5 ATM | LTE Cellular option: No\nWhy we like it: One company that continues to push the limits of what you can buy for just under $300 is Amazfit. The Amazfit Balance 2 offers an elegantly designed smartwatch with Amazon Alexa support and the ability to answer calls via a Bluetooth connection to your watch, just like all other non-cellular smartwatches. It runs the latest Zepp OS 5 operating system, built for a lean and mean experience.\nWho it's for: The\nReview: As a golfer, this is the smartwatch I recommend most on the course\nAmazfit provides the Zepp smartphone application that provides an exhaustive experience to track every detail of the data captured by the various sensors. The one flaw is that the application may be overwhelming for some users and thankfully, Amazfit continues to refine and simplify the application to make it more useful for Amazfit Balance 2 owners.\nThe speakers and microphone support phone calls, your preferred voice assistant, and the Zepp Flow AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT technology. The Zepp Coach function also uses AI to help plan workouts and provide fitness insights in both the free and premium options.\nWho should look elsewhere: While the Amazfit Balance 2 is a powerful health and fitness watch, it has limited support for third party apps so if you are looking for a phone replacement then this is not the model for you.\nAmazfit Balance 2 tech specs: Display: 1.5-inch, 480 x 480 pixels AMOLED | Battery life: 21 days | Dimensions: 47.4 x 47.4 x 12.3 mm | Weight: 43 grams (w/o strap) | Water resistance: 10 ATM | LTE Cellular option: No\nWhy we like it: Withings is focused on providing advanced health and wellness products with the ScanWatch series available to capture data from your wrist. The Withings ScanWatch Nova continues to provide 30 day battery life in a hybrid watch with support for Android and iOS smartphones. It looks like a luxury watch with the included metal band, yet can be used for tracking activities with a quick switch to the included silicone band.\nTo navigate the watch, it's as easy as rotating the crown button through the various displays and pressing in to make selections. There is no back button, so you will need to scroll through the available screens in each widget to get to the back option on the display to return to the original main display carousel.\nReview: One of my favorite smartwatches has a timeless analog look - and the features I need\nWho it's for: With a hybrid design, the Withings ScanWatch Nova has standard analog watch hands on its face with a small OLED display that you can scroll through with the rotating crown button. The ScanWatch Nova can also perform an ECG assessment, measure blood oxygen levels, track your heart rate throughout your day, measure sleep, obtain skin temperature throughout the day and night, and track your general physical activity.\nThe ScanWatch Nova merges elegance and fitness tracking in one attractive device. I like being able to capture key health and wellness data while also satisfying my desire for a gorgeous analog device. At $600, it's a rather expensive piece, so I'd recommend this watch to consumers who are really committed to the look.\nWho should look elsewhere: The minimal watch provides very limited data on the small display so if you are looking for a big colorful display on your watch then consider one of the other watches in this list. There is also no integrated GPS so if you need to track the route of your workout, then consider a watch with GPS tracking.\nWithings ScanWatch Nova tech specs: Display: 0.63-inch OLED| Battery life: 30 days | Dimensions: 42 x 42 x 11 mm | Weight: 63 grams | Water resistance: 10 ATM | LTE Cellular option: No\nWhat is the best smartwatch?\nMy pick for the best smartwatch is the Apple Watch Ultra 2. It may be debatable if an iPhone is the best smartphone or not, but it is clear the Apple Watch is the wearable to beat -- especially for Apple users. The Ultra 2 is lauded by athletes and product reviewers as the best Apple Watch ever made.\nIf you're an Android user, you may prefer a Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra -- the newest of the company's smartwatch lineup. I picked up the LTE model that provides cellular connectivity independently from my phone, but when paired with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it's a perfect combination of elegance and power. The new Google Pixel Watch 3 may also catch your eye with its minimalist elegance and two size options to fit all wrist sizes.\n| Smartwatch | Price | Battery life | Display size |\n| Apple Watch Ultra 2 | $799 | 36 hours | 49mm |\n| Apple Watch Series 10 | $399 | 18 hours | 46mm and 42mm |\n| Google Pixel Watch 3 | $350 | 24 hours | 41mm and 45mm |\n| Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra | $650 | 40 hours | 47mm |\n| Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic | $550 | 18 hours | 46mm |\n| Kospet Tank T3 Ultra 2 | $150 | 35 hours | 48mm |\n| Garmin Venu X1 | $800 | 16 hours | 47mm |\n| Amazfit Balance 2 | $300 | 33 hours | 47mm |\n| Withings ScanWatch Nova | $600 | 30 days | 42mm |\nWhich is the right smartwatch for you?\nIf you're in the Apple ecosystem, we highly recommend the Apple Watch Ultra or Apple Watch Series 10 due to the easy connectivity and convenience of features like Apple Pay and Apple Music.\nThe Google Pixel Watch 3 is the prime option for Pixel owners and for those Android smartphone users who want the best available from Google. It doesn't have the battery life of a Samsung Galaxy Watch, but there are other compelling features that stand out.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Watch 7 are great smartwatches built to last with stellar sensors and the ability to work with Android devices.\nHowever, finding the best smartwatch for you can be more complicated, especially if you're looking for one that fits a specific use case. Check out my expert recommendations below.\nChoose this smartwatch... | If you need... |\nApple Watch Ultra 2 | The best, longest-lasting smartwatch with buttons to quickly launch your favorite apps or perform critical functions. It's a durable, rugged watch that can be your iPhone companion in all situations. |\nApple Watch Series 10 | A well-rounded smartwatch for fitness and communication. There's also Crash Detection, which can detect when you're involved in a car crash and connect you to emergency services. |\nGoogle Pixel Watch 3 | A compelling smartwatch for Pixel and Android smartphones. The Pixel Watch 3 also serves as the best Fitbit available, along with possibly the best watch for helping keep you safe. |\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra | An Apple Watch Ultra 2 competitor from Samsung with similar design elements. It's a Google Wear OS-powered device for Android owners and removes the influence of the Apple Watch Ultra in convincing people to move away from an Android phone. |\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic | A watch with a rotating bezel that fits in well with the user interface optimized for the round watch face. It supports Google Assistant, Google Maps, Google Wallet, Google Play Store, and more Google apps. |\nKospet Tank T3 Ultra 2 | A very affordable smartwatch that surprises with its build quality, long battery life, and accurate location positioning. It's a solid first smartwatch for Android and iOS owners. |\nGarmin Venu X1 | A smartwatch with a big vivid display, but are not interested in an Apple Watch Ultra 2 or Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra then the Venu X1 is the one for you. It is one of the slimmest watches available and you can make and receive calls, use your voice assistant, have 3rd party apps, and more. |\nAmazfit Balance 2 | An affordable smartwatch that punches above its price. It's sleek, rugged, and has long battery life. The powerful Zepp smartphone application provides access to a wealth of health/fitness data while supporting calls and Amazon Alexa. |\nWithings ScanWatch Nova | A hybrid watch that looks like a luxury watch with analog hands, metal band, and high quality fit and finish. Hidden inside this elegant exterior is the power of the Withings health and wellness ecosystem. |\nFactors to consider when buying a smartwatch\nSmartwatches serve as companions to our smartphones, and there are several things to consider as you explore the many options available to you. Several factors will help you quickly narrow down available candidates, so let's take a closer look and help you select the best smartwatch for you.\nPrimary smartphone: Start by looking at the phone in your hand. If you own an iPhone, then you can consider an Apple Watch, or a watch running an operating system that is not powered by Google's Wear OS. If you own an Android smartphone, forget about buying an Apple Watch, as they do not even work with an iPad or Apple computer, let alone your Android. Android users can consider Google Wear OS watches, as well as those running a real-time operating system like Amazfit offers.\nPrice: Most smartwatches are priced in the $250 to $400 range, so there is not a lot of variance in price, especially if you use your smartwatch daily and want a reliable watch. Apple offers the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 2, while there are some specialized Google Wear OS and Garmin watches that can cost more than $1,000.\nBattery life: Expect your smartwatch to last a full day and night, so you can track your sleep and then charge it while you get ready for work. A few new smartwatches are now easily lasting 48 hours between charging, with some pushing that another day or two so we are seeing improvements in battery life.\nCellular connectivity: While smartwatches serve as companions to our smartphones, some models support cellular connectivity. If you buy one of these then you will need a watch line with your carrier, but these are typically $10 per month. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra include LTE support by default, but you are not required to enable cellular service. Cellular capability is great for those who want to leave their phones behind and still remain connected for communications, application usage, and safety.\nHow we test smartwatches\nAll of the smartwatches included in this list were chosen based on how they performed when tested in the real world by the ZDNET team. When we test smartwatches, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.\n- Daily wear: We wear the smartwatch as our primary watch with communications, applications, and other elements being tested as if it was our only smartwatch.\n- Application selection and performance: One aspect that makes smartwatches different than standard watches is the support for applications. We load up the watch with apps and then test the performance and functionality of those applications. Apple excels in the area of third party application support with Google's Play Store improving each year. Garmin, Amazfit, and others also are expanding the number and selection of apps available on watches.\n- Workouts: Smartwatch makers have embraced health and fitness so we take our smartwatch out for running with GPS, rowing on the Hydrow, biking on trails, and walking with the family. GPS and heart rate data is tracked and then we evaluate the accuracy against proven GPS sports watches.\n- Sleep and activity tracking: Sleep tracking has improved with smartwatches over time and we evaluate them as compared to smart rings and other watches. Nighttime is also a good time to charge your smartwatch, so you may choose not to use your watch to track sleep so your watch can serve faithfully all day and into the night.\nFor a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive smartwatch testing methodology.\nLatest news on smartwatches\nGoogle just announced that it will hold its next product launch event in August, and we are sure to see new Pixel Watch models that should improve upon the Pixel Watch 3. We'll be testing any new watches that are released, and will update this list accordingly.\nFAQs on smartwatches\nAre there any smartwatches I should avoid?\nThere are many reasons why a person might want a smartwatch, so depending on your needs, it's hard to recommend watches that will satisfy everyone. However, based on my testing, there are a couple of smartwatches that you may want to leave off your list of considerations as you conduct your research.\nFossil has been offering smartwatches for a long time, and I still have a working Fossil Wrist PDA that is powered by Palm OS and has a tiny stylus. For the past few years, Fossil has been making Google Wear OS-powered smartwatches and offering a fairly compelling option with some unique styles. However, in January 2024 Fossil Group announced that it would no longer be releasing smartwatches, with the last Gen 6 model released in 2021. You can still find some Fossil watches available, and Fossil Group stated that they will continue to update the watches for the next few years, but be careful when you are considering one of these watches.\nThere was a great promise with a luxury Wear OS watch in 2022 when Montblanc released the Summit 3 smartwatch. While we provided a preliminary review as we looked for a future update that was supposed to add some core functionality, that update never came, and the watch sits idly by running the same older version of Wear OS on a processor that is now a couple of generations old. It's a lovely luxury watch so if you want a basic smartwatch with those good looks, maybe you can find one on sale.\nHow do I set up my smartwatch?\nWatches in our list, other than Google Wear OS or Apple Watch models, are typically set up by downloading and installing the associated companion smartphone application and then pairing the watch with that application. Some Google Wear OS watches also use this method since those models have additional applications beyond what Google provides on Pixel Watch.\nIf you own a Google Wear OS smartwatch, primarily from Google or Samsung, then the Google Watch or Samsung Wearable application must first be installed on your Android smartphone. Google Pixel Watch models also now have Fitbit integrated into the watch, but to take advantage of this vast health/fitness ecosystem the Fitbit smartphone application is also required. Samsung also has its Samsung Health application so pairing and setting up a Google Wear OS watch is a bit of a process that generally requires two or more smartphone applications.\nApple Watch users turn on the watch and then follow the prompts to pair it to an iPhone, often with the iPhone camera scanning an image that appears on the Apple Watch face. Apple has the Watch smartphone application preloaded on the iPhone so set up is quick and easy. If you had a previous Apple Watch then you can also have all of that data synced over to a new model, which makes upgrading Apple Watch models one of the experiences that keep people upgrading on a regular basis.\nCan you use a Samsung or Google watch with an iPhone?\nGoogle Wear OS watches used to work with both Android and iPhone devices, but the latest versions of Wear OS from Samsung and Google only support Android smartphones. iPhone users should stick with the Apple Watch, while Android phone users should seriously consider a Google Pixel Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch model.\nGarmin, Amazfit, and Withings watches work flawlessly with both Android and iPhone devices.\nCan I text from a smartwatch?\nYou absolutely can! However, most of their screens are too small to type on, so you'll compose messages with speech-to-text or other dictation functions or choose from several generic, auto-generated responses.\nGarmin watches support quick-response text messaging via a connected Android smartphone. Apple restricts third-party text messaging on the iPhone.\nCan you use a cellular Apple Watch as a standalone device?\nWhile you can leave your iPhone at home while you run, go to the store, or stroll on the beach, you must have an iPhone turned on and connected to the internet at this other location. This is one reason why connecting to an iPhone and switching to an Android makes the Apple Watch useless with an Android phone.\nAfter initial setup, a cellular-enabled Samsung Galaxy Watch or Google Pixel Watch can act as a stand-alone mobile device. With the latest Galaxy Watch 7, Watch Ultra, or Pixel Watch 3 running Wear OS, many more apps can be used on the go, so you can leave the phone behind in most cases.\nWhat are the hot new features in the latest smartwatches?\nHealth and fitness tracking have been the areas with the most innovations and improvements in the last few years. While these watches are not medical devices, they have sensors, algorithms, and applications that help you track trends in your heart rate, stress levels, and blood oxygen levels, even allowing you to detect when ovulation occurs. You can use it as a basic ECG to check if further investigation is needed. The latest Galaxy Watch can also measure your body composition; testing indicates it matches other methods reasonably well.\nThese smartwatches can also serve as capable GPS sports watches to track the details of your outdoor activities. Exercise guidance is provided on the watch with connected health applications on your smartphone so you can keep track of your progress, too.\nWhat's the future of wearable technology?\nWe will likely continue to see expansion of the health and wellness features in smartwatches, but what's next on the horizon for these wrist-based computing devices? With increased connectivity and widespread adoption, smartwatches will likely become more integral to our daily lives. This may include connectivity to other devices in our lives. For example, as you approach your electronic door lock, your paired smartwatch could unlock your door so you can keep both hands on your groceries or luggage when you return home.\nPeople also regularly have video calls with family and friends, not just coworkers, so future smartwatches may integrate tiny cameras so that users can communicate in this same manner while out and about.\nIn addition, as AI continues to integrate into our lives, having this technology available in our watches should help provide data faster and more accurately than simple web search queries that we may carry out with Siri or Google Assistant. Samsung integrates AI in its Energy Score metric, Amazfit integrates an AI coach in its Zepp companion smartphone application, and Google uses AI to screen calls, translate voice recordings, and customize your run coaching based on your performance.\nWhat's the best smartwatch for health monitoring?\nAll smartwatches today integrate advanced heart rate sensors, temperature sensors, blood oxygen sensors, and more, as our health data is tracked 24/7. Samsung led the way with its smartwatch health monitoring, which includes body composition, advanced sleep tracking, ECG, blood oxygen, running power, and even blood pressure measurements.\nGoogle acquired Fitbit, and now the Fitbit ecosystem is deeply incorporated into the Pixel Watch experience. This includes helpful insights, personalized running workouts based on your sleep, activity, and lifestyle, and more practical and helpful feedback to optimize your health and wellness.\nApple has advanced its health monitoring technology, and WatchOS 11 brings even more capability with detailed data measurements in its Vitals application. Training Load is also now available, challenging the likes of Garmin, Coros, and Polar with this advanced fitness metric.\nCan smartwatches monitor blood sugar?\nThe FDA released a safety communication to the public that advises consumers not to use smartwatches or smart rings that claim to measure blood glucose levels without piercing the skin. That said, there are indeed FDA-authorized blood glucose level devices that attach to your body and then send that data to smartwatch applications so that you can use your smartwatch to view the readings from an approved device.\nDevices, like those from Dexcom, send real-time glucose data directly to a compatible watch. For Dexcom monitors, this includes most versions of the Apple Watch. Make sure to check both your glucose monitor and your smartwatch compatibility before deciding whether or not to use your smartwatch to connect to your monitor and smartphone.\nWhat about tracking blood pressure?\nThere are a few models out there that can measure health stats like blood pressure, which are great for giving you a general idea of how your health journey is going so you can keep your doctors up-to-date with your healthcare plans. However, they're not as accurate as a blood pressure monitor, so you shouldn't rely solely on your smartwatch to monitor your heart or general health.\nSamsung provides blood pressure monitoring via its Galaxy Watch models in countries outside the US, with rumors that Apple may launch watches supporting this functionality in 2025.\nShould I choose a smartwatch based on compatibility?\nEric Potter, USA weightlifting Level 1 Coach and Performance Coach at Future Fitness, encourages people to choose a smartwatch based on compatibility, recommending an Apple Watch for iPhone users and a Samsung Galaxy Watch for Android fans. He notes that both smartwatches can track steps, heart rate, and exercise, but there are also crucial differences.\n\"The Apple Watch has a larger interface allowing for easier viewing,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy Watch is cheaper than the Apple Watch, and the battery life tends to last longer.\"\nLatest updates\nJuly 2025: We added coverage of the new Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, which we tested after attending the Samsung Unpacked event in NYC this month. We replaced our former pick for the best Samsung watch for most people, from the Galaxy Watch 7 to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. We also added news of Google's upcoming product launch event.\n- June 2025: We added the new Amazfit Balance 2 and Venu X1 to the list, replacing the Balance 1 and Venu 3S. We also added information on smartwatch news in 2025, and added additional details to each top product."

Google's second-generation flagship earbuds debuted last fall with improved noise-canceling capabilities, a smaller bud shape, enhanced sound quality, and Google Gemini integration.\nAlso: The best Prime Day 3 deals 2025: Our favorite 140+ sales live now\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 normally retail for $229, but they're currently on for $179 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. During this sale, all colors except Wintergreen are on sale.\nI recommend these earbuds over AirPods for Android users, as any smartphone running Android 6.0 or newer can access the Pixel Buds' best features.\nI tested the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and enjoyed their great sound and effective noise cancellation. Despite the earbuds' small shape, they have intuitively placed touch controls on the buds' outer edge. Instead of swiping up and down for volume control, the Pixel Buds promote left/right swipes for volume control.\nReview: Google Pixel Buds Pro 2\nThe Pixel Buds boast 12 hours of continuous audio playback with ANC turned off, plus an additional 30 hours with the charging case. Out of all the premium earbuds on the market from Apple, Samsung, Sony, or even Bose, Google's buds offer the most listening time on one charge.\nHow I rated this deal\nZDNET's rating system grants these 30% savings a 3/5 Editor's deal rating. Since Google's earbuds were released relatively recently, and they're packed with future-proof features, comfort, and a long-lasting battery life, I've bumped up this offer to a 4/5 Editor's deal rating. At their $160 sale price, these premium earbuds are cheaper than all of their Android-focused competitors while offering full utility to almost every Android user.\nWhen will this deal expire?\nDeals are subject to sell-out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings.

A new lineup of Google phones, earbuds, and, my personal favorite, smartwatches, is coming to Android users, Google announced at its Made by Google event earlier this week.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 is Google's latest smartwatch, and the wearable comes packed with new, intriguing features that raise the bar across the smartwatch board. I got to try several of them out ahead of the smartwatch's official launch, and they impressed me and got me excited to wear the watch myself.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nWhile the features of the fourth-generation smartwatch are new, the price of the watch will stay the same, at $350 for the 41mm and $400 for the 45mm. The 41mm watch cases come in matte black with an obsidian active band, polished silver with a porcelain active band, champagne gold with a lemongrass active band, and polished silver with an iris active band.\nOn the 45mm, the watch cases include matte black with an obsidian active band, polished silver with a porcelain active band, and satin moonstone with a moonstone active band.\nPreorders for Pixel Watch 4 begin on Aug. 20, and the smartwatches hit shelves on Oct. 9.\n1. New charging dock\nI had to fumble with the charger on the Pixel Watch 3 several times to land the smartwatch's charging mechanisms in the right place. It's annoying and tedious. The Pixel Watch 4's charging port erases this problem with its new orientation. Instead of flat charging that required a user to perfectly align the magnets to initiate a charge on Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 falls immediately into place with the side-charging port.\nPlus, Google says the Watch 4 is its longest and fastest-charging watch to date, with a 25% faster charging speed.\n2. Satellite communications\nSeveral smartwatches have satellite communications. What separates them from Pixel Watch 4 is Google's first-of-its-kind standalone smartwatch with satellite communications. Most satellite-enabled smartwatches require a phone to connect to. The Pixel Watch 4 doesn't.\nAlso: The best satellite phones of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nIt's powered by Snapdragon's processor, which connects to geostationary satellites to guide you and connect you when you're off grid. This feature is smart, unique, and useful to outdoor adventurers or those with poor connectivity. It is available on the Pixel Watch 4 LTE.\n3. Improved health features\nOutside of being a smartphone's wrist-side companion, a smartwatch is built to health-track with sensors and functionalities you can't find on a Pixel phone. Google is making investments in both sleep and activity tracking with the Pixel Watch 4.\nThe watch gets Google's most accurate sleep tracking and sleep stage detection to date. Additionally, the sensors can more acutely detect variations in skin temperature.\nNow, when users are exercising and forget to record their workout, Google automatically detects and classifies activities while also recording heart rate information. The AI-powered feature learns from your workout regimen to accurately classify these activities over time.\nAlso: Is all this data about our health good for our health?\nThe Watch 4 also uses Gemini as a personal health coach that's been developed with Fitbit to create customized sleep and activity regimens tailored to the user. Whether a Watch 4 user is running their first marathon or aiming for a new PR in the gym, Gemini offers up training plans and advice along the way.\nGoogle also unveiled on Wednesday that it's revamping the Fitbit Premium experience to make the app feel and act more like a personalized health coach.\nI didn't get to try this revamped Fitbit, as the revamp arrives on watches in October, but Google says it will adapt to and create custom routines, generate workouts based on the data it's collected on your activity level and sleep quality, and offer check-ins and adjustments mid-workout.\n4. Watch faces adapt to customizable themes\nAs somebody who loves form equally, if not more, than function, I can't deny myself an aesthetic touch. Google's wearable comes in the form of watch faces that adapt to customizable themes, so that your display is cohesive, personalized, and, in my opinion, cool to look at.\n5. Brighter display\n3,000 nits seems to be the magic number for watch brightness this tech season. Google upgraded its smartwatch, matching the brightness of Samsung's recently released Galaxy Watch 8 and Apple's Ultra Watch 2. The display was bright and vivid.\nAlso: Google is officially replacing Assistant with Gemini - and there's only one way to keep it\nAdditionally, Google developed a domed Actua-360 display that's made to be more glanceable and complement the new edge-hugging buttons that take up more of the Pixel Watch screen.\n6. Replaceable battery\nFor the first time, Google is making the Pixel Watch 4's battery and display replaceable. This is a major stride for both customers and sustainability and seems to be one way the tech giant is addressing the issue of e-waste. Once your Pixel Watch 4's battery dies or its display cracks, you can replace it with a new one and avoid buying a new watch altogether.\n7. Goodbye, Hey Google\nIf you wanted to activate Google's assistant on previous watches, you'd have to say Hey Google. Now, all you have to do is raise the smartwatch and start speaking for quicker query activation.\nThis update makes triggering Gemini quicker, convenient, and conversational."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI tried every new AI feature on the Google Pixel 10 series - my thoughts as an AI expert\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Google's new Pixel 10 lineup incorporates a handful of new AI-powered features.\n- They include photo editing with speech, language translation that uses your voice sample, and prediction of users' needs.\n- The Pixel 10 Series also includes a one-year subscription to the Google AI Pro plan.\nGet more ZDNET: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nThe generative AI explosion means that nearly every phone launch in the past year has been accompanied by its own suite of AI features. Google's launch of its Pixel 10 Series is no different, with some new features Google hopes might draw in new users from other devices.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nAt its Made by Google event, Google unveiled the new Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and Pixel 10, as well as the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a. Beyond fun new phone colors, better camera systems, and other hardware upgrades, AI is at the core, powered by the new Google Tensor G5 processor.\nThe chipset, co-designed with Google DeepMind, can run Gemini Nano on the device, the engine powering all these new AI experiences. Here's a full round-up of the new AI features and my personal hands-on experiences with each.\n1. Magic Cue\nWhile AI tools like chatbots can be helpful, they require you to context-switch to other tabs, ask your question, go back to whichever window you were originally working out of, and paste it in. In order to upgrade that experience and level up the assistance, AI needs to predict your needs -- which is exactly what Magic Cue aims to do.\nAlso: I tried the standard Google Pixel 10 and didn't miss the Pro models one bit\nThe Magic Cue feature suggests relevant information and actions based on what you're doing. For example, in the demo featured in the image above, the user was calling an airline, so Magic Cue automatically surfaced the flight details to prevent scrambling to find them while on the call.\nIn another demo, the user got a text asking where the reservation was. Instead of the demoer having to find the details, Magic Cue surfaced the reservation information based on what was in the user's inbox. Then, all the user had to do was tap and send it. Since the feature leverages the Google Tensor G5 chip, information is processed locally on the device.\n2. Daily Hub\nSticking with the trend of making information as accessible as possible, the new Daily Hub feature found in your Discover feed puts all of the information you need in one place. It also includes an integration with Magic Cue, which gathers insights from your apps.\nAs seen in the image, it can remind you of actions from your Google Keep and Gmail, including dinner plans, reservations, and flight details. In practice, it is very similar to Samsung's At a Glance feature, just native to the Google experience powering Pixel.\n3. Voice Translate\nOne use case where generative AI really excels is language translation. Because LLMs have a deep grasp of language and how people speak -- including conversational and non-linear speech -- speech translation has gotten a lot more accurate. As a result, many smartphone manufacturers, like Apple, are incorporating AI translation in their own products, and Google unveiled its own.\nWith Voice Translation, you can hear a translation in real time while on a phone call. The most noteworthy part is that it copies the sound of the speaker's voice, making the new audio sound as free-flowing and natural as possible. There is also a really helpful transcript you can follow to help keep track of the dialogue even further.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but the Google Pixel 10 has me reconsidering my loyalty\nWhen I demoed the feature, I was pleasantly surprised at how quick it was, and most importantly, at how well it copied my voice to make me sound like I was actually speaking German. At rollout, Voice Translate works when translating to or from English with Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, and Indonesian.\n4. Camera Coach\nA good chunk of the new AI features are focused on elevating your photo-taking and editing experience. The new Camera Coach feature aims to take the guesswork out of taking a photo, using Gemini's multimodal capabilities to help you snap the perfect shot by suggesting angles, lighting, and camera modes.\nBeyond step-by-step instructions, Gemini will even generate a sample image of what you should aim for in the final product. For example, in a demo, the user was trying to take a photo of a plant leaf but had the angle off-center. Gemini generated the image of the leaf positioned correctly, so then all the demoer had to do was match the visual by adjusting his position.\nAlso: Google just copied the worst feature of modern iPhones (but not all hope is lost)\nOne of the features I was most impressed by was Camera Coach's ability to recognize what was being shown in the display, down to the specific location. For example, in the image above, the Camera Coach asked the demoer what they wanted to be shown in the photo by identifying that it was a waterfront view, and that it was Chelsea Piers in New York, alongside the Hudson River.\n5. Edit with Ask Photos\nProducing a good photo is equal parts capturing the right shot and post-production editing to optimize it. However, photo editing can often be tricky (especially if you're inexperienced), as there are so many little tools often used in combination. This new feature allows you to describe the change you want using natural language and have the AI make the changes instantaneously.\nAlso: I tried Pixel Watch 4 - and these are my 7 favorite upgrades in Google's new watch\nFor example, the image at the top of the article was very nicely framed, but it had a distracting glare. Instead of having to find the right tools, you can just say that you'd like to remove the glare, and in a couple of seconds, it's done. Other, more general applications include asking it to \"make it better\" resulted in actions like straightening it out and improving the lighting.\n6. Improved the Add Me feature and Auto Best Take\nWhile the Add Me and Auto Best Take features are not new, Google upgraded them to make them even more helpful. The Add Me feature, which lets people add the photographer to the photo, now works with photos with an even bigger group of people.\nMeanwhile, Auto Best Take automatically finds the best picture in which everyone looks great, where previously you would have had to manually select which ones you wanted to combine.\nBonus: Google AI Pro plan one-year subscription\nGoogle's AI Pro Plan costs $20 per month and packages all of Google's best AI offerings. These include the best models in Gemini and standalone tools, including expanded access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, NotebookLM, Deep Research, Veo 3, and Jules."

Luckily, there are no tricks up its sleeve, just some good magnetic attraction. At ZDNET, I test dozens of MagSafe accessories, from battery packs to wallets, phone cases, tripods, and more. Plus, plenty of other experts have reviewed even more niche MagSafe gear, like SSDs and voice recorders.\nAs a tech editor, I can test out tons of super handy gadgets and gizmos for my phone that I otherwise would never bother checking out on my own accord, and I love a functional (and fun) tech accessory. And as a mobile accessory expert, there are genuinely a few that I reach for nearly every day that stand out from the mountains of MagSafe gear I've tried.\nAlso: Apple's iOS 26 and iPad OS 26 public betas are releasing any minute now\nMy Torras MiniMag battery pack is slim enough for even my tiniest bag, and my bedside table will never be empty of my Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charger. I'd recommend these to anyone looking to level up their phone's functionality, or who's curious to jump into the world of MagSafe for the first time. Most picks are under $100 and won't break the bank.\nMy absolute favorite MagSafe accessories\nThis wallet quickly shot to the top of my rotation and became a favorite in my wallet collection, so much so that it is ZDNET's pick for best MagSafe wallet. While this wallet is very similar to others you can buy, its value is insane. You get a quality vegan leather wallet, strong magnetic hold, five card slots -- including a dedicated ID pocket, notches for easy card access, and five colors to pick from -- all for under $30.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of MagSafe accessories, but this new wallet stand is my ideal iPhone companion\nWhen I tested this wallet, I was most impressed with how functional the dedicated ID slot is and how purposeful every element is. Each feature, like the notches allowing easy card access, was thoughtfully designed, implemented, and truly upgraded the accessory experience. Plus, ESR offers some of the most fun colors I have seen in a long time, including pastel pink and purple (and some universal neutrals, if that's your preference).\nESR customers on Amazon said they were pleased the Aura wallet came in vibrant colors, and liked the strong magnet, dedicated ID slot, and ample storage it provides. Some customers said that the wallet offers excellent value for the price, and it has a five-star rating on ESR's website.\nAlso: The best MagSafe wallets you can buy\nThis Torras MiniMag Battery Pack is the thinnest wireless charger I've tested, and I've had the chance to review a lot. It has no kickstand or added features, but its 5,000mAh capacity is comparable to other packs I've tested. If you're buying a battery pack for the first time, I recommend this one over anything else. Thanks to its slim profile, you'll be able to use it in more situations than not, and if you spend around $50 on a battery anyway, it might as well be multifunctional. The pack provides 18W USB-C charging or 7.5W wireless charging, too.\nAlso: This ultra-thin battery pack I tested is a must-have travel gadget (and it works with MagSafe)\nThe MiniMag is a practical option that ensures you always have a battery pack. I was delighted with its performance, especially for its thin design. Despite the pack's smaller stature, it does not compromise on charging or speed, and I love that the device also comes in pink.\nI love this battery pack so much I bought both colors. Torras users on Amazon said that they liked the quick charging speed, lightweight profile, and slim design of the Torras MiniMag battery pack. However, some said the battery gets too hot. Keep in mind that most battery packs do experience warming with use.\nThe Moft MagSafe tripod and stand combine a sophisticated, sleek design with maximum functionality. I love the affordable yet luxurious look the Moft stand offers. I also find it convenient to take impromptu photos, work from my desk, and watch my favorite shows. You can also use this stand as a selfie-stick-like grip or bump it into a larger tripod (pictured), which is perfect for summer travels.\nThe stand is not only a content creator's dream, but also works well for the everyday tech consumer (that's me, don't be fooled). It's been a great accessory for my walking desk and for following recipes in the kitchen. Newer versions of this stand from Moft also include a spot for up to two cards, so if you need card storage and a stand function, this accessory is for you.\nAlso: The best iPhone accessories of 2025\nMoft customers on Amazon said they liked the stand's fun colors, firm hold, and practical design. Some customers experienced slight wear issues due to the vegan leather construction, but like most products, you will see some wear with daily use.\nAnker's MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station for iPhone is still a wireless charging dream months after my initial purchase, and it's also ZDNET's pick for best wireless charger. This MagSafe charger features 15W charging, offers a stand component for my iPhone, charges all my Apple devices simultaneously, and folds up easily for quick transport and storage. The charger also comes with a wall adapter, which isn't always guaranteed.\nAlso: I found a Qi2 charging station that can do it all (and Apple users will love it)\nI first purchased this Anker charger after ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz tested it last year. I was looking for a safe and functional 3-in-1 charger to reduce the number of cords I needed to pack while traveling. This device is the solution. Unveiled at CES 2023, this 3-in-1 is worth your money if you own an Apple Watch and a pair of AirPods and want a great charger at home and on the go.\nI also enjoy Anker's UFO version of this charger, but if you're only going to purchase one 3-in-1 charging setup, it should be this one. A stand configuration is preferable for daily nightstand use, and you don't need to buy both setups.\nVerified Amazon customers gave this Anker charger 4.6 out of 5 stars. They liked the compactness and convenience of the design, and the easy-to-use setup, foldability, and magnetic strength. However, some customers said the simultaneous charging wasn't consistent.\nOther MagSafe products we think you'd like\nBest desktop MagSafe accessory\nBaseus Nomos 5-in-1 Desktop Charging Station\nI love this desktop multi-charger so much that it's remained on my desk months after I initially tested it. The charger is a bit expensive, but it offers MagSafe charging with an adjustable stand, several ports for additional charging, a retractable USB-C cable perfect for powering up all the battery packs I test, and a digital display for output.\nWhat is the best MagSafe accessory?\nOur favorite MagSafe accessories according to style, function, added features like kickstands, and more. Maybe you're looking for a battery pack to boost your phone or a handy place to store your metro card? We've got you covered with top-tested accessory picks from Torras, Moft, and more.\n| MagSafe accessory | Price* | Type |\n| ESR Aura MagSafe Wallet and Stand | $25 | MagSafe wallet for card and cash storage. |\n| Torras Slim MiniMag Battery Pack | $60 | Slim and portable MagSafe battery pack. |\n| Moft MagSafe Snap Phone Tripod Stand | $40 | Multifunctional, magnetic phone stand. |\n| Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station | $110 | 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless charging dock. |\n*MSRP at time of publication\nWhy should you trust me?\nI test tech for a living, whether the gadgets are mobile accessories, MagSafe gear, or power banks. I have strong opinions on what makes a tech product worth your money, because I know that budgets are tight and there's no greater disappointment than wasting a paycheck on a middling device. I do my research, checking competing websites for the newest products, reading Reddit threads and Amazon reviews, speaking with researchers and analysts about what makes a particular device good or bad, and, when in doubt, testing everything out for myself.\nFor this story, each primary pick is a product I've had the opportunity to test and still truly use in my everyday life. If I included additional products of interest, I consulted and cited ZDNET's experts who have used them. I considered price, quality, and use cases for poolside gadgets, among other things, to curate this list. While there is plenty of different tech I could have recommended to you, these are the MagSafe accessories that I think are the very best.\nWhich phones are MagSafe compatible?\nMost of the iPhone 12 through the iPhone 16 models are MagSafe compatible. Unfortunately, the iPhone 12 and 13 Mini models don't feature MagSafe and, therefore, cannot be used with MagSafe accessories. The latest iPhone 16e isn't compatible, either. However, MagSafe rings that are sold separately can convert non-MagSafe cases into MagSafe-compatible cases.\nAlso: How to add MagSafe to your Android phone (and why you'll love it)\nHow do I know my iPhone is MagSafe compatible?\nThe iPhone 12 through iPhone 16 models (minus the Mini and a few select models, like the 16e) feature MagSafe technology. If you're not sure what type of iPhone you have, go to Settings > General > About, and you'll see what model your phone is.\nDo I need a specific case to use MagSafe accessories?\nIdeally, you should equip your phone with a MagSafe phone case, which also helps to protect your phone and strengthen the magnetic connection if you add MagSafe accessories. You can find MagSafe phone cases at Apple or other retailers, such as Amazon and Best Buy.\nTechnically, you can use many MagSafe accessories without a case on select devices, but the grip is less likely to be secure.\nAlso: 5 reasons why I always use a MagSafe phone case (and you should too)\nWhat does RFID mean?\nSome MagSafe accessories, like wallets, often advertise RFID protection. According to the Department of Homeland Security, RFID refers to radio frequency identification. This technology uses radio waves to identify people or objects.\nThere are devices that can read information contained in a wireless device or \"tag\" from a distance without making any physical contact or requiring a line of sight -- for example, the chips in credit or debit cards. Wallets that feature RFID-blocking technology prevent these devices from accessing information stored in protected chips, which can help to stop your bank information from being compromised."

Instead, it competes by adding quality-of-life features -- a couple of which are industry-firsts for a foldable phone.\nIf you are ready to upgrade from a slab phone to a foldable one, now is the best time to do so. However, it can be confusing to make a decision when both Google and Samsung book-style foldables are so good this year.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nHere's how the new Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold compares to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, and which one is the best for you.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold if\u2026\n1. You work in a dust-prone environment\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first book-style foldable to sport an IP68 rating, which means it is truly resistant against minute dust particles. In comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rated IP48 for dust and water resistance, so it is protected against solid particles bigger than 1 millimeter. Since dust particles are smaller than 1mm, there's no guarantee that a Z Fold 7 will do well against dust.\nAlso: Google just settled the foldable phone debate with one number -- and I hope Samsung is watching\nIf you live in a place susceptible to dust or work in a dusty environment, the Google foldable will serve you better. It isn't dustproof, per se, but you can get extra peace of mind when using it in those environments.\n2. You are shifting from an iPhone\nIf you can't wait for a foldable iPhone and want to switch to a book-style foldable this year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the phone to buy. While switching to a Samsung foldable is equally easy/tedious, you'll be able to retain your iPhone's MagSafe-compatible accessories if you buy the Google foldable.\nThe Pixel 10 series comes with a new feature called PixelSnap. It is like MagSafe, where you get magnets to attach a slew of accessories. The new tech is based on Qi2 standards and offers 15W wireless charging on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. So, if you have MagSafe-compatible charging pads, power banks, or even tripods, they should theoretically be compatible with the new Google phones. This makes shifting to an Android foldable easier for an iPhone user.\n3. You want a more affordable folding phone\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best (if not the best) book-style foldables you can buy right now. It weighs less than most slab flagship phones and feels like a 'normal' phone in the hand. But it also carries a massive $2000 price tag. If you don't want to spend two grand on your new phone, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the way to go.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nThe new Google foldable undercuts its Samsung rival by $200. The base 256GB storage variant is priced at $1,800. You can currently purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 7 for as low as $1,700 on Amazon, but that's the current discount price. Once it goes on sale, you should be able to find discounts on the Pixel foldable, too.\n4. You want to use all the Gemini AI features for a year\nIf you are new to the AI world and want to try the best of Google AI features for free, Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the way to go. The company is offering a year's worth of Gemini AI Pro subscription for free with its Pixel 10 Pro series. This means you can get enhanced features like access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Veo 3 for AI-generated videos, 2TB of cloud storage, and previews of upcoming AI tools. By contrast, Samsung is giving six months of free access to the same service with its Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nYou should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 if\u2026\n1. You want the slimmest and lightest folding phone\nI love my Galaxy Z Fold 7 for its slim and light design. In fact, it is more comfortable to hold and use than big flagship phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Samsung's own Galaxy S25 Ultra. At 215 grams, it is one of the most comfortable phones to use on the market right now. Plus, it measures just 8.9mm when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded, which feels surreal at times.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nSamsung has almost perfected the form factor with its latest foldable. If you want a foldable phone without the foldable design quirks, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the phone for you (if you are a right-hander, because hinge edges are still very sharp for left-handed people).\n2. A folding phone's crease bothers you\nWhen I first unboxed the Galaxy Z Fold 7, I was amazed by the inner screen's flatness when I rubbed my hand over it. If you have used a folding phone before but couldn't live with it because of a gigantic crease running down the middle of its big screen, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be a breath of fresh air for you.\nSamsung's new folding phone features the smallest crease in its segment. You can still see it at certain angles, but it won't bother you at all. In comparison, Google's crease situation still needs work.\n3. You want a polished suite of AI features\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 can run Gemini, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold can't run Galaxy AI features. That's not to say the Google phone doesn't have exclusives. The new Magic Cue and Camera Coach features are worth trying.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nHowever, Galaxy AI has a more tried-and-tested suite of comparatively more polished AI features, such as AI Select, a damn good object eraser, and more. You can also avail free six months of Gemini AI Pro to try Veo 3, NotebookLM, etc., with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\n4. You want to buy a foldable in the next few weeks\nIf you want to buy a new folding phone in the next month, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is your only choice because the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't go on sale till October 9. That's seven weeks after launch. By contrast, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is already available and might persuade potential Pixel buyers, especially at the new price.\nI have yet to use the Pixel 10 Pro Fold as a daily driver, so I don't have an opinion on the cameras or battery life. While it packs a bigger cell than its counterpart, I'll only be able to tell the difference after I have used it in daily life. Both phones run Android 16 out of the box and are promised to receive up to seven years of OS and Android security updates, so they should last long."

Finally, Android is invited to the magnetic snap party, with the Pixel 10 being the first Android to support wireless charging with a magnetic snap and the Qi2 charging standard. Google is launching Pixelsnap alongside three accessories to start, with an entire ecosystem of branded accessories coming down the road.\nSince the technology here is based on the Qi2 wireless charging standard, any of the MagSafe accessories previously marketed for iPhones will work on the Pixel 10. This opens up a ton of options for Android users who were previously relegated to workarounds and third-party products with varying degrees of success.\nThe Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) announced its pursuit of a standardized system for Apple and Android devices as far back as two years ago, but magnetic Qi2 charging technology built into the phones has been sorely missing from Android devices for years.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nThis is despite the fact that Androids were the first to offer wireless charging over 10 years ago, but have since been outpaced by the iPhone's MagSafe feature, which has spawned an entire ecosystem of products from wallets to chargers to other accessories.\nGoogle's branded products releasing today include the Pixelsnap ring stand for $29, which just props your phone up on a surface and acts as a secondary grip, the Pixelsnap charger that snaps to the back of the phone but has a wired connection for $39, and a combo charger with a stand for $69.\nYou can expect a host of new products in the Pixelsnap ecosystem soon, including everything we see from MagSafe products like car mounts, grips, wallets, and other unique accessories.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nAll of the new Pixel 10 models will support PixelSnap wireless charging, reaching speeds of up to 25W, the Qi2 standard for both iPhones and Android devices.\nFor Apple, this means losing its majority market share in the MagSafe accessory category, since many of the devices that were previously marketed for the iPhone will now work on the Pixel 10. If additional Android models open up to this feature (and they most certainly will), it will no longer be a selling point unique to the iPhone."
