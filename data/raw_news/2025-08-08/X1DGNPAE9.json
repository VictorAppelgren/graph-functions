  "description": "Julie Chen Moonves addresses Ashley Hollis\u2019 attempt to switch her eviction vote during an unprecedented live moment on 'Big Brother'",
  "content": "Big Brother fans were treated to an all-time moment in the show\u2019s 27-season history on Thursday, August 7, during a live eviction episode when houseguest Ashley Hollis cast her vote, then re-entered the diary room to try and change it.\n\n\u201cToo late,\u201d host Julie Chen Moonves told Entertainment Weekly in a story published Friday, August 8. \u201cWe didn\u2019t count her change of heart.\u201d\n\nBig Brother 13 winner and current houseguest Rachel Reilly seemed to spark the moment. She cast her vote to evict Kelley Jorgensen, then passed Ashley, 25, in the hallway, where Rachel, 40, appeared to stop and plead for her to vote the same way.\n\nThe conversation, inaudible to TV viewers, lasted far longer than it typically takes between votes, before Ashley finally entered the diary room. When Chen Moonves asked for her vote to evict, Ashley appeared to struggle for several seconds before voting to evict Kelley, 29, over Jimmy Heagerty.\n\nOn the way out, she passed Will Williams, who was about to cast his vote. The two spoke briefly in another unheard conversation before Ashley pivoted and returned to the diary room to change her vote \u2014 a Big Brother first.\n\nChen Moonves, stationed outside the house during live episodes, was unable to do anything in the moment but say \u201cno, no, no\u201d into her microphone. It is unclear if Ashley was able to hear her.\n\n\u201cI think Ashley may be one of these people who responds to whoever is the last one to have her ear,\u201d Chen Moonves said Friday. \u201cAshley\u2019s conversation in the hall with Will after she already voted to evict Kelley influenced her decision and then she tried to change it.\u201d\n\nAs much as Ashley struggled with her decision, Chen Moonves didn\u2019t seem to have much sympathy for her. She said Ashley had the chance for strategic discussions once the nominations were set. The houseguests have several minutes after the weekly Block Buster competition, in which Riley Jeffries removed himself from the chopping block this week, to discuss what to do.\n\n\u201cEveryone must play their own game,\u201d she said. \u201cShe could have discussed what to do with her housemates in the house after I announced who remained on the block. That is what that time is for when I lay out and let them be, not when we begin calling people to the diary room.\u201d\n\nAshley\u2019s vote \u2014 which Chen Moonves confirmed to viewers was for Kelley\u2019s eviction \u2014 ultimately didn\u2019t matter. Jimmy, 25, was ultimately evicted by a 9-2 vote.\n\nBig Brother airs on CBS on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at 8 p.m. ET. Fans can watch live feeds from the house anytime on Paramount+.",

      "text": "Since the U.S. edition of Big Brother premiered in July 2000, the CBS reality game show has become a pop culture phenomenon.\nEach season, viewers dedicate themselves to watching the houseguests\u2019 every move, thanks to not only the TV episodes but also the 24/7 live feeds online as well as countless Twitter accounts and Reddit threads that follow the series day in and day out.\nJulie Chen Moonves has served as the host of Big Brother and all of its editions since day one \u2014 even after her husband, Les Moonves, was ousted from his role as CEO of the network in September 2018 over sexual misconduct allegations. (He has denied having any nonconsensual encounters.)\nBig Brother has had multiple iterations since its premiere, including all-stars seasons in 2006 and 2020, a streaming-only version titled Over the Top in 2016 and two celebrity editions so far.\n\u201cI had no idea if it was going to last past season 1,\u201d Chen told CBS Local in July 2018. \u201cAnd if we did get through season 1, I thought I was going to get fired \u2014 the critics didn\u2019t like me, they didn\u2019t like the show. We went through some major changes between season 1 and season 2, and first and foremost we have fans who were extremely loyal ever since season 1.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cWe have a lot of fun changing the game so that each year we have our loyal fans coming back, new fans check it out, and here we are! I really don\u2019t see any signs of us slowing down. It\u2019s like an addiction at this point; it\u2019s a guilty pleasure.\u201d\nAnd 20 years in, the show has continued to make history. In February 2019, Tamar Braxton became the first-ever Black winner in the U.S. franchise\u2019s run. Making her victory even sweeter, the R&B singer received a unanimous vote from her former housemates to take home the $250,000 grand prize over former NFL running back Ricky Williams.\nFrom Eddie McGee to Jackson Michie, scroll down to take a look back at every Big Brother, Celebrity Big Brother and Big Brother: Over the Top winner from 2000 to 2022!"

      "text": "The Big Brother motto is \u201cExpect the Unexpected,\u201d and the CBS reality series has served up some satisfying blindsides over the years.\nLiving together in a house cut off from the rest of the world often means that houseguests sniff out exactly who their fellow houseguests plan to vote for on eviction nights. However, contestants sometimes manage to conceal their plans until it\u2019s time to deliver the fatal blow and send someone packing.\nKeep scrolling for a look back at the craziest blindsides in Big Brother history:\nMarcellas \u2014 Season 3\nThe Power of Veto may have been a new development in season 3, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Marcellas Reynolds\u2019 use of it \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 from going down as one of the worst moves in Big Brother history.\nDuring week 9 of the 2002 season, Marcellas was nominated for eviction alongside Amy Crews. He then won the Power of Veto, giving him the opportunity to take himself off the block. However, he decided not to use the power, feeling certain that Amy would be evicted over him.\nMarcellas\u2019 ally Danielle Reyes then voted to evict him and Head of Household Jason Guy cast the tie-breaking vote sealing his fate. Marcellas was so unprepared to leave the house that he quickly grabbed some of his clothes from a dresser before he walked out.\nEven Big Brother host Julie Chen Moonves couldn\u2019t resist reproaching Marcellas for the foolish move; she playfully hit him on the head during his exit interview.\nDr. Will \u2014 Season 7\nDr. Will Kirby is widely regarded as one of the best Big Brother players of all time, but even he can be surprised. During the show\u2019s first all-stars season in 2006, Will formed an alliance with Janelle Pierzina based largely on flirting.\nAt final four, Janelle and Erika Landin realized that Will and Mike \u201cBoogie\u201d Malin were using them to further their own games and had no real loyalties to anyone but each other. When Janelle won the final Veto competition of the season, she cast the sole vote to evict Will, taking both him and Mike by surprise.\nKeesha \u2014 Season 10\nKeesha Smith fully trusted in her final three deal with Dan Gheesling and Memphis Garrett during the 2008 season. What she didn\u2019t know was that Dan and Memphis had formed the Renegades alliance early in the game and intended to bring each other to the finals.\nAt final four, Memphis won the last Power of Veto competition, allowing him to cast the sole eviction vote. He and Dan decided to keep Jerry MacDonald over Keesha, feeling that Jerry was less of a physical threat.\nKeesha was shocked and hurt when she learned about the plan. \u201cWhoever the f\u2013k sends me out of here better not think that they\u2019re getting my vote, that\u2019s for damn sure!\u201d she yelled.\nShane \u2014 Season 14\nAfter winning season 10, Dan returned as a coach in 2012. During week 3 of the season, the coaches were given an opportunity to play as individuals, and Dan, Mike, Janelle and Brittany Haynes then entered the game.\nDan went on to play even more ruthlessly than he had the first time around. At final four, he pulled off the biggest blindside of the season by convincing his No. 1 ally Danielle Murphree to leave her showmance partner, Shane Meany, on the block after she won both Head of Household and the Power of Veto. Dan told Danielle that he would use his sole vote to evict Ian Terry, but he voted against Shane instead, leaving both Shane and Danielle in shock.\nAustin \u2014 Season 17\nAustin Matelson joined the ranks of Big Brother players betrayed by those closest to him during the 2015 season. He and Vanessa Rousso made a final two deal during week one, but that didn\u2019t stop Vanessa from casting the sole vote to evict Austin at final five.\nAustin was so sure that Vanessa would keep him safe that he didn\u2019t wear shoes to the eviction ceremony. He walked out of the house barefoot after telling Vanessa that she didn\u2019t have the jury votes to win the game.\nPooch \u2014 Season 24\nJoe \u201cPooch\u201d Pucciarelli felt so confident about his position in the house that he volunteered to go on the block next to Taylor Hale \u2014 who went on to win the season \u2014 when Jasmine Davis was Head of Household in July 2022.\nAlthough Pooch was initially a pawn, Jasmine and her Girls Girls alliance decided to shift the target onto him after learning that Pooch was aligned with several of the men in the house, including Daniel Durston and Kyle Capener.\nDespite thinking he was safe, Pooch was unanimously evicted by a 12-0 vote on eviction night, and the term \u201cgetting pooched\u201d became a running gag for the rest of the season.\n\u201cFor it to be 12-0 is shocking. I thought I would have heard from one person, but obviously, they were all on the same page,\u201d Pooch told Chen Moonves after his elimination. \u201cWhen I heard 12-0 I genuinely felt, \u2018Oh cool, I\u2019m straight.\u2019\u201d\nHisam \u2014 Season 25\nHisam Goueli thought his third week in the Big Brother house would be smooth sailing when his Professors alliance member Felicia Cannon became Head of Household in August 2023. He had no idea that Felicia was planning to backdoor him, meaning nominate him for eviction after the Veto Competition was played so he didn\u2019t even have a chance to compete for his safety.\nTo make matters worse, Hisam told his alliance members that he didn\u2019t want any of them to pick him to play for the Veto since he had already won too many competitions.\nHisam was stunned when Felicia named him as the replacement nominee after Jag Bains won the Power of Veto and took himself off the block. After Hisam was unanimously evicted days later, he exclusively told Us Weekly it was \u201chard not to feel betrayed\u201d by his alliance members.\n\u201cI\u2019m devastated. Of course I\u2019m hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go back to the conversations you [had] and you\u2019re realizing people are telling you things that are not true and you believe them because you trust them.\u201d"

      "text": "The Big Brother 27 cast took to the backyard for the legendary swimsuit photoshoot.\nAll 17 houseguests soaked up the sun as they posed in their swimwear in Us Weekly\u2019s exclusive first look. The women dazzled in a variety of beach-ready styles, from bikinis to one-pieces. The guys rocked board shorts, with some opting to cover up while others went shirtless.\nBig Brother icon Rachel Reilly brought the fire as she stunned in a red ruffled one-piece. She completed the look with a pair of shades. While Reilly, 40, is a Have Not during the first week, she was granted safety from eviction. Cliffton \u201cWill\u201d Williams, Zach Cornell and Ava Pearl were also named Have Nots but also received immunity.\nWill, 50, kept it laid back as he opted for a black polo and shades. Zach, 27, was all smiles in his salmon shorts and sunglasses. Ava, 24, brought the good vibes as she stunned in a red long-sleeved one-piece with cutouts. The aura painter completed the look with a floppy sun hat with a sunflower in its brim.\nHead of Household (HOH) Vince Panaro wore striped shorts and a brown beanie. He went sans shirt to show off his tatted arm. Vince\u2019s nominees \u2014 Amy Bingham, Ashley Hollis and Isaiah \u201cZae\u201d Frederich \u2014 were in good spirits as they were all smiles for the camera.\nAmy, who successfully entered the game after being undetected as The Mastermind\u2019s accomplice, wore a red halter swimsuit top paired with a black sarong. Zae, 23, donned blue swim shorts, sunglasses and slides. (The salesperson made headlines earlier this week after he used a slur on the live feeds but immediately backtracked his comment.)\nWhile Ashley, 25, has been under fire all week after taking a two-hour-long shower in the HOH room, she brought the heat with her swimwear photo. The attorney wore a magenta bikini and a multicolor sarong. She gave a sweet smile as she posed on a lounge chair.\nKatherine Woodman, Kelley Jorgensen, Mickey Lee, Lauren Domingue and Morgan Pope showed off their toned physique in their bikinis. Adrian Rocha and Rylie Jeffries opted to go shirtless. Keanu Soto and Jimmy Heagerty kept it cool with a tank and shorts combo.\nBig Brother 27 kicked off on Thursday, July 10. As the players have settled into the Big Brother house, they\u2019re gearing up to vote out the first person of the season. The nominees not only have the Power of Veto in play but also the BB Blockbuster, this season\u2019s version of the AI Arena from last year. On eviction night, the three nominees will compete in a live competition to be removed from the block.\nBig Brother continues on CBS tonight with a 90-minute episode starting at 8 p.m. ET. Fans can watch live feeds from the house anytime on Paramount+."

I think she\u2019s a sweet person. I was grateful she was in the house,\u201d Amy, 43, exclusively told Us Weekly on Friday, July 25, following her eviction. \u201cJust having someone closer in age and a mother just made me feel better being in the house because nobody really understands like missing your kids.\u201d\nAmy added that it was \u201cnice to have\u201d Rachel, 40, by her side in the house for those hard moments. However, their fast friendship put a target on Amy\u2019s back right away.\n\u201cI was happy to have her there until it was bad for my game,\u201d she said.\nAmy acknowledged that she knew from a \u201cstrategic\u201d perspective, she \u201cshould have distanced herself\u201d from Rachel. However, both she and her son had a feeling before going into the Big Brother house that the friendships she would make would be her downfall.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I\u2019m gonna be a target because of the friends I make in the house.\u2019 And my son even told me, \u2018Ma, I\u2019m so afraid you\u2019re gonna make friends with the wrong people in the house. That\u2019s gonna be your downfall,\u201d she told Us. \u201cAnd he called it, he knew it, but I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m a loyal friend in real life. I\u2019m a loyal friend in the game. I don\u2019t know how to be anything else. It\u2019s just who I am.\u201d\nEven trying to hide a close connection is a struggle for Amy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to do that. I don\u2019t know how to keep things under wraps,\u201d the insurance agent quipped.\nAmy was voted out of the game on Thursday, July 24, in a unanimous vote. While Amy was \u201csurprised\u201d Rachel and fellow ally Ashley Hollis didn\u2019t throw her a vote to keep her, she understands why they ultimately went with the house.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me that they weren\u2019t gonna vote for me. I thought they would vote for me, but it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about stuff like that. Save your game. I\u2019m already out. I don\u2019t need a vote or two. It really doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\nWhen Amy walked out the door, she candidly called Jimmy Heagerty \u2014 the Head of Household who put her on the block \u2014 a \u201csnake.\u201d Amy explained she decided to take that moment to share her true thoughts about Jimmy and the \u201clies\u201d he\u2019s spread.\n\u201cI wanted to call him out so much throughout the show \u2026 It was hard to watch him lie and listen to his lies. Like, I really was struggling,\u201d she told Us. \u201cHe is charismatic and funny. I\u2019ll give him that and he is so fun to be around. So he has that going for him.\u201d\nBig Brother airs on CBS on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at 8 p.m. ET. Fans can watch live feeds from the house anytime on Paramount+."

      "text": "Big Brother host Julie Chen Moonves has an opinion on the state of the Big Brother 27 house \u2014 and it\u2019s probably not what fans are expecting.\n\u201cI think Kelley [Jorgensen] has become the dark horse,\u201d Chen Moonves, 55, told Entertainment Weekly in an interview published Friday, August 1. \u201cAs long as the BB Block Buster exists, she can keep this going. She is good at comps and focused.\u201d\nKelley, 29, has caught the ire of Big Brother fans for volunteering to be nominated for eviction each week of the game so far. In weeks 1 and 3, she won the BB Block Buster competition on eviction night to earn her safety, and in Week 2, was able to win an individual power of veto competition to save her game.\nIn the Week 3 eviction, which aired Thursday night, July 31, Kelley\u2019s win resulted in Adrian Rocha being evicted in an emotional 8-4 vote. Adrian, 23, is a Big Brother superfan, and on his way out the door, accused his fellow houseguests of playing scared in the game\u2019s early weeks.\nChen Moonves agreed, with one notable exception.\n\u201cI think he had the assessment right,\u201d she said. \u201cI do agree that no one but Kelley is taking risks and playing hard.\u201d\nCompare that to some of the criticism Kelley has faced from former Big Brother houseguests.\n\u201cIm sick I wanted Kelley Gone #bb27,\u201d Big Brother 19 winner Josh Martinez wrote via X after Kelley saved her game on Thursday.\n\u201cI think that dummy Kelley will go home tonight,\u201d Big Brother 8 winner Dick Donato added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what she gets for volunteering to be on the block. And even dumber thinking volunteering to be on the block would \u2018help her resume.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThis bish has Happy Gilmore level luck,\u201d wrote Big Brother 20\u2019s Angela \u201cRockstar\u201d Lantry.\nWhile Chen Moonves defended Kelley, she still had sympathy for Adrian, who told fans before the season about the extensive training he put himself through to prepare for the Big Brother house. That included sleeping on the floor to simulate being a \u201cHave Not,\u201d and building his own version of common competitions in his backyard.\nWhile in the house, he often spoke about how he was playing the game for his family, hoping to win the $750,000 grand prize to help them.\n\u201cEveryone knows Adrian is a good kid who loves the game, came to the house for his family and has no enemies,\u201d Chen Moonves said. \u201cThey were gutted knowing he was going to get evicted. They didn\u2019t want to hurt him, but it\u2019s the nature of the game.\u201d"

Each week, Big Brother challenges its stars with new tasks and twists as they compete to be named Head of Household or secure the Power of Veto, determining who will be evicted from the house. A group of eliminated houseguests form the Jury, which ultimately chooses the winner when two contestants remain. Viewers are also able to vote for America\u2019s Favorite Houseguest, which was introduced in 2007 and awards $25,000 to the fan-favorite player.\nThe Big Brother franchise originated in Europe in the \u201890s. As of summer 2023, the show airs in 63 countries around the world. The U.S. edition is the longest-running in the franchise to date.

He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a rep for the family said in a statement to Us Weekly. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, while explaining her decision to halt her Las Vegas residency, Clarkson revealed that Blackstock was suffering from an illness, though she did not specify the exact condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she said in a statement shared via Instagram on Wednesday, August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The pair welcomed daughter Savannah in June 2002 and son Seth in November 2006. (Blackstock later became a grandfather in January 2022 when Savannah gave birth to her first baby, son Lake, with Quentin Lee. She announced in July 2025 that she is pregnant with the couple\u2019s second baby.)\nClarkson and Brandon \u2014 whose father was her former manager Narvel Blackstock \u2014 began dating in February 2012 and tied the knot one year later in October 2013. The pair welcomed daughter River in June 2014 and son Remington in April 2016. During their marriage, Brandon served as Clarkson\u2019s manager.\nIn June 2020, Clarkson filed for divorce from Brandon after nearly seven years of marriage. The exes finalized the proceedings in March 2022, and Clarkson was granted primary custody of their two children. (The twosome had a messy battle in court over property and finances.)\nIn January 2024, Clarkson reflected on her divorce from Brandon, revealing that their marriage was not her idea.\n\u201cI never wanted to get married the first time,\u201d she told People. \u201c[Brandon] had children, a religious background, and it was important, I think, for him. But I\u2019ve never been that person.\u201d\nClarkson explained that her hesitancy stemmed from what she\u2019d seen her loved ones deal with, adding, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been through a couple divorces in my family, I just don\u2019t like to put any weight on it.\u201d\nIn March, Clarkson shared a rare glimpse into her coparenting dynamic with Brandon during an appearance on Kylie Kelce\u2019s \u201cNot Gonna Lie\u201d podcast.\nWhile discussing kids\u2019 double standards for their mothers and fathers, she sarcastically confessed, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that I keep in \u2026 because coparenting is fun.\u201d\nBlackstock is survived by River and Remington and his two older children, Savannah and Seth."

      "text": "Julie Chen Moonves reacts to Big Brother player trying to change eviction vote (exclusive) Nice try, Ashley. By Dalton Ross Dalton Ross California Dreams was better than Saved by the Bell. There, I said it. EW's editorial guidelines Published on August 8, 2025 07:44AM EDT 1 Comment Julie Chen Moonves and Ashley Hollis on 'Big Brother' season 27. Credit: cbs Each week, Big Brother host Julie Chen Moonves will weigh in on the latest events inside the house exclusively with Entertainment Weekly. This week, she reacts to Mickey taking out an ally, Ashley hilariously trying to change her vote, Jimmy leaving the house, and the full-blown showmance between Rylie and Katherine. Julie Chen Moonves on 'Big Brother' season 27. Matthew Taplinger/CBS ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Mickey just sent one of her biggest allies out of the house instead of nominating Vince, who Morgan even told her was \"my number one guy\" \u2014 which would seem to be even more of a reason to get rid of him. Make it make sense for me! JULIE CHEN MOONVES: What you may or may not be able to make out by watching the show is how universally liked Vince is in the house. He has done an excellent job of making himself seem loyal to so many of his housemates and he doesn't come across as threatening. He seems like a harmless, likable loyal housemate. I think with Mickey nominating Jimmy it was the disloyalty she felt like he personally betrayed her (and Morgan). She found out he was playing with others as if he was aligned with them and only them. On top of that, when he was HOH. he didn't consult Mickey (or Morgan) about his nominations or moves and he spent an awful lot of time laughing and bonding in the HOH room with Katherine and Lauren. This was a woman scorned move. It became personal. Mickey Lee on 'Big Brother' season 27. cbs Oh, the drama, Julie! We have to talk about Rachel convincing Ashley to vote out Kelley, and Ashley then leaving the Diary Room, talking to Will, and running back in attempting to change her vote to Jimmy. Tell me about the decision to let those conversations in the hallway play out, and then not allowing Ashley to change her already cast vote. I think Ashley may be one of these people who responds to whoever is the last one to have her ear. Ashley's conversation in the hall with Will after she already voted to evict Kelley influenced her decision and then she tried to change it. Too late. We didn't count her change of heart. Everyone must play their own game. She could have discussed what to do with her housemates in the house after I announced who remained on the block. That is what that time is for when I lay out and let them be, not when we begin calling people to the diary room. Ashley Hollis on 'Big Brother' season 27. cbs 'Big Brother' star Adrian Rocha is shocked to learn actual eviction votes The Mastermind from 'Big Brother' speaks in exclusive interview Now that he is out of the house, what's your take on Jimmy's overall game this season and why he was out there talking to you this week? Jimmy is not the first person to play more than one side of the house. This season alone we see so many people doing that\u2026 Morgan, Vince, Zach to name a few. He, unfortunately, got busted by Mickey while she had all the power and he was never given the chance to explain himself or apologize or work out some kind of deal to save his game. It was the perfect storm that did him in more than his overall gameplay. Jimmy Heagerty on 'Big Brother' season 27. cbs Finally, we have our first big showmance of the season. What do you make of Rylie and Katherine's connection inside the house? I think it's adorable. I like that they got to know each other first as friends and got to show each other that their feelings for one another are more important than the game. Rylie was ready to sacrifice his game for Katherine. Be sure to watch BB Unlocked Friday night when you will get to see never before seen video of these two taking their relationship to a new level!
