He has won six Premier Leagues, two FA Cups, for League Cups, the Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup. The 32-year-old was a key member of City\u2019s 2022-23 treble triumph.",

      "text": "Manchester City have signed Ederson from Benfica for a British record fee for a goalkeeper. The 23-year-old Brazilian joins Pep Guardiola\u2019s side after two seasons in the Primeira Liga.\nBenfica released a statement on Thursday morning say that they had reached an agreement with the Premier League club to sell the goalkeeper for \u20ac40m (\u00a334.9m).\nThe goalkeeping situation was one of Guardiola\u2019s biggest problems during his debut season in England despite the signing of Barcelona\u2019s Claudio Bravo for \u00a313.75m. The Chilean failed to impress and Guardiola, in the end, resorted to rotating him and Willy Caballero as City finished third in the league, 15 points behind Chelsea at the top, and were eliminated from the Champions League in the last 16 and lost an FA Cup semi-final to Arsenal.\nJoe Hart spent the season on loan at Torino and the England No1 is now likely to leave the club on a permanent deal.\nEderson becomes City\u2019s second summer signing, after the capture of the Monaco midfielder Bernardo Silva for \u00a343.6m.\nThe club have sold their young Turkish striker Enes Unal for \u00a312m to Villarreal while releasing Caballero, Ga\u00ebl Clichy, Jes\u00fas Navas and Bacary Sagna, who had all reached the end of their contracts.\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"
