  "content": "WI > > I'M SCARLET FU. TIM: I'M TIM STENOVEC. WELCOME TO \"BLOOMBERG CRYPTO.\" SCARLETT: A LOT OF THE TALK CENTERED ON THE DEBUT OF THE WORLD LIBERTY TOKEN ENDORSED BY PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY. TIM: THE LATEST CRYPTO BUSINESS IN LINE FOR U.S. LISTING. SCARLET: WE SPEAK TO THE CEO OF HYBRID LIQUID STRATEGIES PART OF EIGHT DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY TREND. TIM: FIRST, LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MARKET. YOU ARE SEEING QUITE A BIT OF GREEN. RISK OFF DAY FOR STOCKS AND BONDS AND NOT SO MUCH FOR CRYPTO. BUDGET CONCERNS IN DEVELOPED WORLD COUNTRIES RESURFACING. IT IS ALL GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO THESE THREE CRYPTOCURRENCIES. BITCOIN UP 1.8, 1.9%. ETHER MOVING BETWEEN RED AND GREEN BUT UP .3%. HITTING AN ALL-TIME HIGH OF $4800 PER TOKEN JUST LAST WEEK. SCARLET: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A TWO DAY CHART OF THE MARKET CAP, A CRYPTOCURRENCY TIED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY. IT BEGAN TRADING YESTERDAY AND CANNOT BE BOUGHT AND SOLD ON THE OPEN MARKET. EACH TOKEN IS WORTH $.30 BUT THE MARKET CAP COMES UP TO $6 BILLION, PUTTING IT AT THE 32ND OR SO BIGGEST TOKEN BY MARKET CAP. TIM: DEBUTS AND MAKES MONEY AT LEAST ON PAPER. IT CONTINUES THE EMBRACE OF CRYPTO. THE SEC COMMISSIONER REPEATING THE STANCE OF WELL-BEING -- WELCOMING DIGITAL ASSETS. > > AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, WE SAW A LOT OF EFFORT TO SUPPRESS CRYPTO AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES. I THINK THAT IS ONE THING THE PRESIDENT DID ON HIS THIRD DAY WHEN HE ISSUED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF THE CLEAR GOAL THAT WE NEED TO MAKE UNITED STATES WHERE THE LEADERS IN DIGITAL ASSETS. SCARLET: LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THE CRYPTO SPACE AND TURN TO ASSET STRATEGY COMPANIES. ANNOUNCING AN 880 $8 MILLION DEAL TO LAUNCH THE HYBRID LIQUID EXCHANGE. DAVID SCHAMIS IS THE CEO. THAT IS A LOT OF WORDS EXCHANGED . PUT IT INTO CONTEXT. WHAT DOES HYBRID LIQUID EXCHANGE DO AND HOW DOES THE HYPER LIQUID TOKEN FIT IN? DAVID: THE COMPANY IS LESS THAN THREE YEARS OLD, AMAZINGLY AND HAS NEVER TAKEN ANY OUTSIDE MONEY, PRIVATE EQUITY. IT HAS 10 EMPLOYEES BASED IN SINGAPORE AND HAVE A RUN RATE OF OVER A BILLION DOLLARS ANNUAL FREE CASH FLOW, AN AMAZING THING. IT IS ALSO AMAZING HOW A FEW PEOPLE DON'T MUCH ABOUT IT. WHEN WE RAISE THE CAPITAL TO BUY THE TOKEN IN THE DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY COMPANY, WE REACH OUT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. I SPOKE TO TWO VERY WELL-KNOWN CRYPTO PERSONALITIES, PEOPLE YOU GUYS WOULD KNOW MY NAME WHO I WILL NOT MENTION ON THIS SHOW WHO HAD NEVER HEARD ABOUT US. TIM: THEY ARE NOT ALONE. DAVID: IT IS AN EXCHANGE LIKE A COINBASE BUT ALSO ITS OWN LAYER ONE BLOCKCHAIN LIKE ETHEREUM OR BITCOIN. IT HAS ALLOW THEM TO BUILD AN EXCHANGE THAT IS VERY SLEEK, VERY EFFICIENT, THAT YOU CAN TRADE REALLY EFFICIENTLY WITH A LOT OF LIQUIDITY ON BUT ALSO HAS ALLOWED THEM TO CREATE AN ECOSYSTEM THAT OTHERS CAN BUILD ON TOP OF IT. SO PHANTOM, THE CRYPTO WALLET, RECENTLY STARTED ALLOWING PERKS, VERY POPULAR IN THE CRYPTO WORLD, LOUD TRADING ON THEIR APP. INSTEAD OF BUILDING IT THEMSELVES WHICH IS HUGE AND COMPLICATED, THEY LITERALLY JUST LINKED INTO HYPER LIQUID EXCHANGE SYSTEM. THERE IS A REVENUE SHARING THING AND NOW PHANTOM IS IN THE BUSINESS LIKE THAT. TIM: WHY IS IT THE RIGHT HORSE TO BET ON IN THIS SPACE? THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF OPTIONS OUT THERE. OTHERS ARE MORE POPULAR, WAR -- MORE WELL-KNOWN. WHAT IS TO SAY THERE IS ROOM FOR THIS? DAVID: I LIKE BETTING ON THINGS LESS WELL-KNOWN BEFORE THEY BECOME BETTER KNOWN. TO MEET THAT IS THE RIGHT STRATEGY. I THINK BITCOIN IS STILL A PERFECTLY GOOD BY TODAY. THERE IS STILL ROOM TO GO IN MY OPINION BUT WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF GROWTH IN BITCOIN. I THINK THIS HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. THE HYPER LIQUID TOKEN. THE OTHER THING IS IT IS NOT EASILY OWNED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE ONLY PLACE THE HYPER LIQUID TOKEN TRADES RIGHT NOW IS ON THEIR OWN EXCHANGE. THE HYPER LIQUID EXCHANGE IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO U.S. FULL. SCARLET: WHY IS THAT AN ADVANTAGE AND NOT A DRAWBACK? DAVID: BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING A DIGITAL ASSET COMPANY THAT IS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE. WE WILL TRADE ON THE NASDAQ. YOU CAN BRIGHTEN YOUR FIDELITY OR ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT OR WHATEVER, WHERE IS BUYING THE TOKEN IS A LOT MORE COMPLICATED. IF YOU WANT TO BUY BITCOIN TOMORROW, THAT IS NO PROBLEM, YOU CAN BUY BITCOIN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS SITTING RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK. TIM: THIS IS A TOKEN ON THE RADAR OF REGULATORS? WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS ON THE RADAR AND THE LEGISLATION THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNED INTO LAW WHEN IT COMES TO DIGITAL ASSETS. IS THIS ON THE RADAR OF FOLKS IN WASHINGTON? DAVID: I DON'T KNOW. TIM: DOESN'T CONCERN YOU THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS? DAVID: I'VE NOT HEARD OF THIS BUBBLING TO THE LEVEL OF WASHINGTON BEING SUPER FOCUSED ON IT AND I THINK THAT ON ONE HAND IT IS A TOP 10 COIN, I THINK THAT THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING HERE THAT IS PARTICULARLY CONTROVERSIAL. IT IS A LIKE A LOT OF OTHERS AND ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXCHANGE WE THINK IS GOING REALLY QUICKLY AND PROFITABLY. SCARLET: IS THAT A USE CASE? DAVID: THE EXCHANGE THAT GENERATES THE FLOW BY SPEC THE COIN ON A REGULAR BASIS. NEARLY EVERY DAY THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE ASSISTANCE FUND THAT IS PART OF THE EXCHANGE AND SOMETHING LIKE 97% OF THEIR FREE CASH FLOW THEY USE TO BUY BACK. SO UNLIKE BITCOIN OR YOUTH OR WHERE THERE IS NO USER OF THEIR BURNING THE COIN ON A REGULAR BASIS, HERE YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FREE CASH FLOW, BEST MAJORITY GOING TO BUY THE COIN. TIM: WELL THAT REMAIN IN PERPETUITY? DAVID: I EXPECTED TO. TIM: IF IT DOESN'T COME WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PRICE? DAVID: IF THERE ARE LESS BUYERS AND MORE SELLERS, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO PRICE GENERALLY. WE THINK THAT ALL THIS WAS THE BEST MONTH HYPER LIQUID HAD AND THE SECOND BEST WAS JULY. WE SEE A GROWTH TRAJECTORY THAT IS REALLY EXCITING. RECENTLY A VERY LARGE, OJI BITCOIN OWNER, WE DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS, -- A LARGE BITCOIN OWNER, WE DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS, THEY DECIDED TO SELL AND COULD HAVE PICKED ANY PLACE BUT THEY WENT THERE. I YEAR AGO OR SIX MONTHS AGO THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED BUT THE HYPER LIQUID COMMUNITY WAS THRILLED THAT THE OG CHOSE HYPER LIQUID TO SELL AND BUY. SCARLET: YOU CONTRACTS WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WITH A YEAR AGO, WHERE DO YOU THINGS -- SHE THINKS HEADED SIX MONTHS AND A YEAR FROM NOW? DAVID: AS IT CONTINUES TO GROW IN MORE PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT IT, IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO TRADE. AS MORE PARTNERS COME ON BOARD, LIKE PHANTOM, THAT CAN LEAK INTO THE ECOSYSTEM. THEY HAVE DONE THEIR PARTNERSHIP ANY SMART WAY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO PARTNER WITH COINBASE AND YOU WANT TO GO MEET BRIAN ARMSTRONG, HAVE MEETINGS, MEET DEALS, HAVE LAWYERS INVOLVED, IT IS COMPLICATED. HERE THEY LOAD IN ARE YOU LEAK INTO THEIR SYSTEM. THERE ARE FEW LINES OF CODE YOU PUT IN AND YOU ARE IN. IT IS A VERY SMART AND GENIUS WAY. SCARLET: FRICTIONLESS. DAVID: A GOOD WAY TO SAY IT. TIM: THAT IS DAVID SCHAMIS. LET'S GET BACK TO THE WORLD LIBERTY FINANCIAL TOKEN DEBUT YESTERDAY. WE HAVE BEEN COVERING THE STORY. I WAS SHOCKED EARLIER TO READ A STORY ABOUT THE SPECIFIC TOKEN ITS RATING THAT DEBUTED YESTERDAY AND FIND OUT THE TRUMP FAMILY NET WORTH HAS BEEN ECLIPSED PRETTY REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS HAVE BEEN ECLIPSED BY THE VALUE OF THEIR CRYPTO HOLDINGS. HOW HAS THIS TOOK PLAYED INTO THAT? > > THE TRUMP FAMILY IS INVOLVED WITH LIBERTY FINANCIAL, BOTH DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND ERIC TRUMP ARE COFOUNDERS OF THIS COMPANY. IT HAS ITS OWN STABLECOIN AND THIS CRYPTOCURRENCY THAT STARTED TRADING YESTERDAY AND THE FAMILY ALSO GETS A CERTAIN PERCENT OF REVENUE FROM WORLD LIBERTY FIVE FINANCIAL -- LIBERTY FINANCIAL. IT ROSE YESTERDAY BUT TODAY IS NOW DOWN A LITTLE BUT STILL WITH THAT, THIS IS A TOKEN THAT NOW HAS A MARKET CAP OF NEAR $6 BILLION. THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG BOOST FOR THE TRUMP FAMILY. SCARLET: IS THERE A USE CASE FOR THIS TOKEN? > > THIS IS USED WITHIN THE WORLD LIBERTY FINANCIAL BLOCKCHAIN. IT ALSO INTERACTS WITH THEIR UST ONE STABLECOIN. WE ALSO NOW KNOW AS WELL THAT THERE WILL BE A TREASURY COMPANY THAT THE TRUMP BROTHERS ARE INVOLVED IN THAT WILL BE -- WAS A BIOTECH COMPANY THAN A FINTECH AND NOW IT IS HOLDING CRYPTO TREASURY OF WORLD LIBERTY FINANCIAL TOKENS THAT WILL HOLD $1.5 BILLION. THEY ARE HOLDING THAT AS WELL AS PEOPLE TRADING IT ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. TIM: AND THE PRESIDENT'S INVOLVEMENT OR STEVE WITKOFF'S INVOLVEMENT, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEIR INVOLVEMENT RIGHT NOW? HOW ARE THEY LISTED? > > THE PRESIDENT IS NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY. ALL TRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT, DO GET A CERTAIN PERCENT AFTER THE COMPANY REACH CERTAIN TARGETS WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY MET. THEY DO GET SOME REVENUE FROM IT . IT IS FROM WHAT WE KNOW BEING HELD INDEPENDENTLY IN A BLIND TRUST. THE PRESIDENT IS NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED BUT HIS SONS ARE COFOUNDERS AND VERY MUCH INVOLVED WITH THE COMPANY AND SIMILAR WITH THE STEVE WITKOFF'S SON WHO IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE COMPANY. SCARLET: FANTASTIC CONTEXT. SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THERE HAVE BEEN A RUSH OF CRYPTO LISTINGS AS THEY EMBRACE -- AS THE ADMINISTRATION EMBRACES IT. THERE IS AN UPCOMING IPO. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? > > THEY LAUNCHED THE IP OVER GEMINI TODAY SEEKING TO RAISE $317 MILLION THROUGH THE IPO LISTING 16.7 MILLION SHARES AT A PRICE OF 17-19 DOLLARS PER SHARE. THIS IS A CRYPTO COMPANY THAT DOES A BIT OF EVERYTHING. THEY HAVE A CRYPTO EXCHANGE, THEY OFFER A STABLECOIN, A CREDIT CARD WITH CRYPTO REWARDS. AT ONE OF THE LATEST OF THE CRYPTO COMPANY IS TO DO THESE TYPES OF OFFERINGS. WE HAVE SEEN A CIRCLE AND BULLISH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS BOTH IN THE CRYPTO SPACE HAVE LARGE IPO'S THAT JUMPED MONTHS THEY STARTED TRADING. I AM SURE GEMINI IS HOPING FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR. SCARLET: THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN ON BLOOMBERG CRYPTO SOON. COMING UP, A LOT MORE. TIM: WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK WITH REBECCA RETTIG, AS GP DATA IS PUT ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. CHECK US OUT ON THE TERMINAL. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a > > SOLANA IS FASTER AND MORE DESIGNED FOR HIGH PROCESSING SPEED. WHEN I SAW THE BIG DEBATE, ABOUT STABLECOINS, THIS IS A HUGE OVERSIGHT. I THINK SOLANA IS ACTUALLY THE STORY AS FAR AS STABLECOINS GO. TIM: THERE HAVE IT, THE REX FINANCIAL CEO GREG KING SPEAKING LAST WEEK. FOR NOW ON SOLANA AND BLOCKCHAIN, REBECCA RETTIG JITO , CEO OF LABS, INC. WE WANTED YOU ON FOR A FEW REASONS. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED LATE LAST WEEK FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT POSTED DATA ON PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN'S INCLUDING BITCOIN, SOLANA AMONG OTHERS. DID ANYTHING CHANGE ABOUT THE DEAD AS A RESULT OF BEING POSTED ON THESE BLOCKCHAIN'S? > > THE DATA DIDN'T CHANGE BUT THE VERIFIABILITY AND THE USABILITY OF IT DID CHANGE IN TERMS OF WE NOW HAVE AN ABILITY TO STREAM THIS TYPE OF DATA INTO ALL SORTS OF APPLICATIONS. PEOPLE CAN GO BACK MANY YEARS AND SEE AND VERIFY IT AND LOOK AT ITS ACCURACY. I DON'T THINK THE UNDERLYING DATA HAS CHANGED BUT THE NATURE OF THE DATA HAS CHANGED AND THAT IS WHEN A CRITICAL FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN GENERALLY AND IT HELPS FACILITATE WHAT WE THINK OF AS INTERNET CAPITAL MARKETS WHERE HE BRING FINANCE AND MORE ROBUST WAY AND THIS IS ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS DOING THAT. SCARLET: IT INCREASES ACCESS TO THIS DATE OUT. IT IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE ON THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE AND IF YOU HAVE A BLOOMBERG TERMINAL YOU CAN ACCESS THAT THEY ARE BUT TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE USING DECENTRALIZED PLATFORMS THAT THEY NOW HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DATA. REBECCA: THEY DO AND THERE ARE FEATURES THAT TAKE OFF CHAIN DATA AND MAKES IT ABLE TO STREAM INTO THE NEW DIGITAL TYPES OF FINANCIAL APPLICATIONS. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ARTICLES. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TAKEN DATA AND MADE IT STREAM MOBILE INTO DECENTRALIZED FINANCE APPLICATIONS. THIS WILL BE ABLE TO BE USED IN A MUCH MORE ROBUST AND DISTRIBUTED WAY. TIM: I AM WONDERING ABOUT TRUST AND SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRUST OF THIS DATA. IT TAKES ON NEW MEANING AFTER WHAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, SPECIFICALLY A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT FIRED THE HEAD OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AFTER THE JOBS REPORT THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE FOR THE MONTH OF JULY IN TERMS OF TRUST IN A WORLD WHERE I THINK PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING GOVERNMENT DATA BECAUSE THEY ARE HEARING THAT IT IS QUESTIONABLE FROM THE HIGHEST SOURCES IN GOVERNMENT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. DOES THIS DO ANYTHING FOR TRUST OF GOVERNMENT DATA? I DON'T KNOW IF IT DOES BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRESS RELEASE FROM THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT, IT TALKS ABOUT A VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF TECHNOLOGICAL HASH BUT A TYPE OF WAY TO GRAPHICALLY ENSURE THE VERIFIABILITY OF THE DATA. A LOT OF VERY TECHNICAL WORDS BUT WHAT IT MEANS IS IT IS REALLY A WAY TO AUDIT AND VERIFY THE DATA IS CORRECT AND TO PUT IT ONTO THE BLOCKCHAIN AND IT AN IMMUTABLE WAY WHERE IT CAN'T BE CHANGED AND TAMPERED WITH AND CAN BE SEEN IN PERPETUITY FROM THE TIME IT WAS PUT ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. YOU CAN GO 10, 20, 50 YEARS FROM NOW AND STILL SEE THE SAME HASH WITH THE SAME INFORMATION IN A TOTAL TAMPER WAY. SO THAT PROVIDES CONFIDENCE TO THE FOLKS WHO MAY NOT HAVE FULL FAITH IN THE DATA AS IT IS BEING DISTRIBUTED, PARTICULARLY IF THE DATA IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING. IF YOU TAKE A STEP BACK, WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT IS MAKING DATA LIKE GDP AVAILABLE ON THESE PLATFORMS, PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN'S? REBECCA: I WOULD SAY THAT OUR GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN USING VARIOUS TYPES OF BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS ARE BLOCKCHAIN'S THEMSELVES FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT COULD THE EU HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING AND PUTTING CERTAIN TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RECORDS ON BLOCKCHAIN'S OR POSTAL TYPE OF INFORMATION ON BLOCKCHAIN'S. THE SAME HAS HAPPENED IN SINGAPORE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN VARIOUS TYPES OF SANDBOXES AND THIS IS THE U.S. REALLY KEEPING UP WITH THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGY AND MAKING SURE NOT JUST THAT THE U.S. IS THE CRYPTO CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AS THE PRESIDENT SAID A NUMBER OF TIMES BUT ALSO THAT THE U.S. IS STAYING ABREAST OF WHERE THE ECONOMY IS GOING AND ENSURING THAT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT WORKS AND IT IS IN LINE WITH THE WAY THAT THE REST OF THE ECONOMY WORKS. SCARLET: SO IT IS SYMBOLIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH. COMING UP, CREDIT CARDS VERSUS STABLECOINS. MORE ON THE COMPETITION FOR CHEAPER AND FASTER PAYMENTS. WILL CRYPTO DISRUPT THE CREDIT CARD SPACE? THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: BIG RETAILERS LIKE AMAZON AND WALMART TRYING TO CREATE THEIR OWN STABLECOIN. THE NEXT GUEST SAID CREDIT CARD COMPANY SHOULD BE WORRIED AS THE STABLECOINS COULD BE THE NEW WAY CUSTOMERS GET REWARDS POINTS. PAUL, MAKE THE CASE FOR WHY CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FACE THE THREAT FROM STABLECOINS. PAUL: THANKS FOR -- THANKS FOR HAVING ME. I AM QUITE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE GROWTH OF STABLECOINS IN GENERAL, PARTICULARLY AS A PLACE TO STORE CASH BUT AS A PAYMENT TECHNOLOGY, THEY ARE MUCH MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY ARE FAST, CHEAP. THE THING WITH CREDIT CARDS IS THEY STILL ARE VERY HIGH SWIPE FEES IN THE U.S. COMPARED TO ALMOST EVERY OTHER MARKET. RICHARD DURBIN HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THIS FOR YEARS BUT THEY ARE STILL 1.5% TO 3% ON ALL TRANSACTIONS. THAT IS GREAT IF YOU REALLY ARE INTO CREDIT CARD REWARDS POINTS AND IF YOU DO WELL AT COLLECTING THEM AND CLEARING THEM QUICKLY AND SPENDING THEM WELL FOR SOME PEOPLE REALLY BENEFIT FROM IT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET THE BENEFITS OF THE REWARDS AND THE RESELLERS PAY THE TRANSACTION COSTS WHICH YOU DON'T GET WITH STABLECOINS HEARD THE STABLECOINS CAN OFFER REWARDS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T OFFER INTEREST ON THAT TREASURIES AND STUFF TO BACK THE VALUE. BUT THERE IS A KIND OF REWARDS OPTION IN THEIR. IT CAN BE QUITE A CHALLENGE. TIM: TALK ABOUT THE BUY-IN YOU WOULD NEED TO SEE FROM CONSUMERS TO DO THIS. WHEN WE STILL HAVE A CREDIT CARD, WE DON'T THINK OF THE INTERCHANGE FEE OR TRANSACTION FEE. THAT IS COMPLETELY ON THE RETAILER, THE MERCHANT WHERE WE ARE BUYING WHATEVER GOOD OR SERVICE COULD WHAT IS THE BUY-IN YOU HAVE TO GET FROM THE CONSUMER TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR? PAUL: YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THIS AS SEAMLESS AND ALMOST UNNOTICEABLE AS POSSIBLE. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CREDIT CARDS AND STABLECOINS IN THE SENSE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PRELOAD YOUR ACCOUNT TO SPEND WHEREAS CREDIT CARDS COME YOU CAN CLEAR THE BALANCE AT THE END OF THE MONTH. YOU CAN ALSO USE IT FOR BORROWING BUT IF A RETAILER COMBINED WITH A STABLECOIN ISSUER AND A BY NOW, PAY LATER COMPANY, PERHAPS YOU CAN SQUARE OFF ALL OF THOSE THINGS. ULTIMATELY THE WAY IT IS GOING TO WORK IS IT THE YIELDS -- STABLECOIN ISSUERS CAN SHARE IT AND IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE COST OF TRANSACTION FEES AND WHAT CREDIT CARDS CAN OFFER, MAYBE THE REWARDS WILL BE GREATER AND MAYBE THAT IS WHAT WILL DRAW CONSUMERS IN. SCARLET: YOU COVER BANKS AND WRITE ABOUT BANKS OFTEN. HOW DO THEY FIT INTO ALL THIS? PAUL: THEY WILL WATCH THIS VERY CLOSELY. RETAILERS CANNOT ISSUE THEIR OWN COINS SO THEY WILL NEED TO PARTNER WITH SOMEBODY LIKE A CIRCLE THAT RUNS U.S. D.C. BUT YOU CAN BET THE BANKS BY JP MORGAN, BANK OF AMERICA, THE OTHER CARD COMPANIES WILL KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON DEVELOPMENTS AND TRY TO FIND THEIR OWN WEIGHT TO DO SOME PARTNERSHIPS WITH AMAZON'S, WALMARTS, AMERICAN AIRLINES OF THE WORLD. TIM: IF YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE ENTICING FOR CONSUMERS, YOU CAN CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR FOR THOSE DEALS. THANKS MUCH FOR CHECK OUT HIS COLUMN ON THE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL AND BLOOMBERG.COM/OPINION. THAT WILL DO IT FOR BLOOMBERG CRYPTO. JOIN US NEXT WEEK. WE WILL BACK SAME TIME, SAME PLACE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.",
