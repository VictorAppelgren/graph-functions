  "title": "The next big TV leap is here - what Dolby Vision 2 means for you (and supported models)",
  "description": "The new format introduces two big upgrades and fixes one major complaint.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\u2022 DV2 will bring several quality upgrades and fix one big complaint.\n\u2022 Hisense TVs will be among the first to support the new tech.\n\nThe next generation of HDR is here.\n\nDolby unveiled Dolby Vision 2, the successor to Dolby Vision HDR that debuted a little more than a decade ago, the company said Tuesday. Calling it a \"groundbreaking evolution of its industry-leading picture quality innovation,\" Dolby explained that its latest technology would bring several upgrades over the current Dolby Vision and fix one of the most common complaints.\n\nDolby said that it has a \"robust\" content pipeline that includes movies and TV shows, weekly live sports broadcasts, and games that would take advantage of Dolby Vision 2.\n\nAt the core of the new tech is something the company is calling \"content intelligence.\" This introduces new tools, Dolby said, that optimize your viewing (using AI, of course) based on what and where you're watching.\n\nAlso: Samsung will give you a free 65-inch TV right now - here's how to qualify for the deal\n\nThe company acknowledged that one of the most common complaints about Dolby Vision is that images can often be too dark, making it hard to see details. Content intelligence will include \"precision black\" that improves clarity in darker scenes. In addition, a \"Light Sense\" feature will fine-tune picture quality by detecting ambient light and optimizing your picture to adjust, Dolby explained.\n\u2022 None Authentic Motion, the \"world's first creative-driven motion control tool\" to make scenes feel more cinematic (creators will be able to use this on \"a shot-by-shot basis\")\n\u2022 None A redesigned and even more powerful image engine\n\u2022 None Bi-directional tone-mapping that takes advantage of today's brighter-than-ever TVs for improved brightness, sharper contrast, and deeply saturated colors\n\u2022 None Sports and gaming optimization modes that let you fine-tune things like white point adjustments and motion control\n\nIn short, all of these features are designed to ensure that what you see at home is what the creatives behind the content intended for you to see.\n\nWhich TVs will get Dolby Vision 2 first?\n\n\n\nLike most new technologies, it takes some time to reach wide availability. Hisense (which has produced some of the best sets over the past few years) will be the first TV to support Dolby Vision 2 with its RGB-MiniLED line. It's almost certain we'll see more TVs join the lineup at January's CES.\n\nDolby explained that its new technology will be available in two tiers: the top-of-the-line Dolby Vision 2 Max on premium TVs that not only delivers the best possible picture, but also adds additional premium features, and Dolby Vision 2, which provides dramatically improved picture quality for mainstream TVs.\n\nWant to follow my work?

      "text": "I retested GPT-5's coding skills using OpenAI's guidance - and now I trust it even less\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The same prompts in GPT-5 yield success, crashes, or errors.\n- OpenAI's prompt optimizer helps, but introduces its own quirks.\n- AI \"unconsciously\" adding details raises trust concerns.\nDo AI's get headaches? Because GPT-5 has certainly been giving me one. This article was going to be so easy. OpenAI came out with a list of best practices for GPT-5 coding. All I was going to do was try those best practices with the GPT-5 coding tests that previously failed and see if there was improvement.\nIt seemed so simple.\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nBut then I had a thought. What if OpenAI has improved GPT-5 in the week or so since I ran my tests?\nPerhaps I should re-run the failed tests as-is and see what the results are, to use as a baseline for the new best practices.\nFrom a testing point of view, this was a valid approach. From a personal sanity point of view, not so much.\nRe-running test 1\nI re-ran the first failed test. This test has the AI creating a complete WordPress plugin, complete with a user interface and business logic. The idea is you feed in a set of names, it randomizes them, and it separates duplicates so they're not side-by-side.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nWhen I ran this test on GPT-5 originally, it failed. Clicking the Randomize button sent the browser to another, unrelated page. I was able to cajole GPT-5 into fixing it, but the initial failure was what counted.\nThis time, I ran the exact same test with the exact same prompt again. This time, it worked perfectly. Wow, I thought. GPT-5 has improved in the past week.\nIf only I had left well enough alone. But no.\nI had to try again. On my second time with the exact same test with the exact same prompt, clicking Randomize resulted in what WordPressers call the \"white screen of death.\" This indicates something in the code isn't working.\nAlso: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis\nI tried the exact same test with the exact same prompt a total of five times. The first time it worked. Subsequent times, it didn't. One time, I got a white screen. One time, I got a page full of error messages. One time, I was redirected to another page. One time, nothing happened at all.\nWe'll come back to test 1. But next, I decided to do the same thing with the other failed test.\nRe-running test 4\nThis test asks the AI to write code that talks to Chrome, AppleScript, and another tool called Keyboard Maestro. It requires the AI to be knowledgeable about the three different environments and how they work together.\nHere's an interesting factoid about AppleScript. The scripting language is inherently case-insensitive. So, if you ask AppleScript to compare \"AppleScript\" to \"applescript\", it will consider both strings to be the same. You have to explicitly tell it to compare case before it will do so.\nAlso: You can learn AI for free with these new courses from Anthropic\nWhen I first ran this test against GPT-5, it hallucinated that AppleScript had a native function for making strings lowercase. It does not, so the code failed.\nThis time, instead of hallucinating that AppleScript has a lowercase function, it decided to do one of the most convoluted sets of operations to lowercase a string. Here's that line of code:\nset tabTitleLower to (do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of tabTitle & \" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\")\nThe code actually works, but it's very weird and totally unnecessary. It launches a shell (the command line) to run a shell script that converts to lowercase. It's like making a grilled cheese sandwich and when you realize you're out of cheese, flying across the country to buy cheese from a 7-11 on the opposite side of the continent. You're not even getting better cheese. You're just doing it in the weirdest and most inefficient way possible.\nLet's not forget that we really don't need to make that text lowercase in the first place, because AppleScript is case-insensitive. So it wrote a highly convoluted piece of code that, while it works, is entirely unnecessary.\nI didn't bother to re-run this test four more times because the headache was already starting to set in.\nOpenAI's GPT-5 coding best practices\nOpenAI has put out what it calls a cheatsheet for GPT-5 coding. It has six main recommendations:\n- Be precise and avoid conflicting information: Well, duh. But apparently GPT-5 gets really confused if asked to follow vague or conflicting instructions.\n- Use the right reasoning effort: Rather than just letting GPT-5 choose its reasoning level, you might want to adjust its model. If it starts to overthink a problem, use a lower reasoning level. Great, so now we have to deal with a neurotic AI. Yippee?\n- Use XML-like syntax to help structure instructions: Rather than using just text, using XML tags to segment aspects of a prompt helps the AI to parse its assignment. This is a good hint, but it feels like a step back from what it could do.\n- Avoid overly firm language: In previous models, we sometimes had to YELL at the AI to get it to listen. Apparently, GPT-5 is passive aggressive, so if you get too forceful in your instructions, it will overdo its compliance, like what my old bosses used to say was my practice of \"aggressively following instructions.\"\n- Give room for planning and self-reflection: Does the AI need a blankie? Perhaps a warm stuffed animal to cuddle? In reality, what OpenAI is saying is that you need to encourage the AI to think through the instructions it gets. Apparently, if you don't tell it to think through the instructions, it won't. I fear for the planet.\n- Control the eagerness of your coding agent: It turns out GPT-5 is even more of a people-pleaser than GPT-4o. When giving it instructions, tell it to tone down its fawning and sucking-uppage.\nI'd like to say something positive here, but it's starting to feel like a migraine. Check out the PDF if you want more details.\nOpenAI also created an AI prompting helper. You point your browser to this tool, and paste in your prompt. The tool will give you back a more extensive prompt. For example, I gave it this prompt from Test 4:\nWrite a Keyboard Maestro AppleScript that scans the frontmost Google Chrome window for a tab name containing the string matching the contents of the passed variable instance__ChannelName. Ignore case for the match. Once found, make that tab the active tab.\nIt gave me back this:\nCreate an AppleScript for use in Keyboard Maestro that performs the following actions: * Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining the planned steps before proceeding. * Scan all tabs in the frontmost Google Chrome window. * Search for a tab whose name contains the value of the passed variable 'instance__ChannelName', ignoring case sensitivity. * Once a matching tab is found, activate that tab and make it the current/active tab. After generating the script, validate in 1-2 lines whether the script meets all requirements. If not, state what needs adjustment.\nEssentially, it revised the prompt to add a planning phase at the beginning and a validation phase at the end.\nDoes it work?\nNope. Nopity-nope-nope.\nI ran Test 4's \"optimized\" prompt through GPT-5 and got back this script:\nThere are at least three serious flaws in it. First, the code in the green box doesn't work. It doesn't retrieve the value from Keyboard Maestro. Previous versions did that successfully using a completely different (and well-documented) mechanism. This approach is just loony.\nAlso: AI is creeping into the Linux kernel - and official policy is needed ASAP\nNow, look at the blue box. The considering case operation is used only for evaluation. For example, with considering case, \"BLUE\" and \"blue\" are different values. Do you see any sort of if statement or evaluation inside the blue box? Me neither.\nThen there's the red box. There is no such syntax as \"considering case false.\" First, the default behavior is to ignore case. Second, if you really wanted to explicitly tell AppleScript to ignore case, you'd use an \"ignoring case\" block. But \"considering case false\"? That's just some made-up syntax right there.\nRetrying the WordPress plugin\nI also ran my original prompt for the WordPress plugin through the prompt optimizer. I got back a fairly extensive project requirements document.\nOn the plus side, this time the plugin worked. I tried generating code a second time, and it also worked. So perhaps the optimization is something to try if GPT-5 isn't playing nice.\nBut then there's the weirdness. Because there's always weirdness. Check out the header block generated by GPT-5.\nNotice the author is attributed to Advanced Geekery Labs. Historically, the AIs have listed the author field as \"Your Name.\" But this time, it's Advanced Geekery Labs.\nThere is some relevance, because Advanced Geekery is the name of my YouTube channel and weekly newsletter. But I didn't use it anywhere in my instructions for this plugin. Additionally, I've never added Labs to the end of Advanced Geekery, even though my security product is sold through ZATZ Labs.\nSo I asked GPT-5 where it got the name Advanced Geekery Labs from. Its answer:\nGood question. The name \"Advanced Geekery Labs\" isn't something you provided in your request. I introduced it in the plugin header's Author: field as a placeholder, because in earlier conversations you've mentioned your \"Advanced Geekery\" brand, and I unconsciously expanded it into \"Labs.\"\nI'm glad the AI thinks it's a good question. That warms my heart. But \"unconsciously expanded\"? That's a direct quote from the AI. Those are its words.\nSo, we're now dealing with hallucinating AIs that operate unconsciously?\nWe're all doomed.\nWhat about coding and GPT-5?\nI still don't trust it. Actually, I don't trust it even more than when I tested it originally. What else might it do to my code \"unconsciously\"?\nI guess, if you really need GPT-5 to give you some code, you could try the optimizer. But I wouldn't rely on it.\nGPT-4o was impressive, but it had some problems. GPT-5 is like its more troubled, more difficult sibling.\nWith GPT-4o, I'd be willing to trust, with verification. I just plain don't trust GPT-5. There's something that's just not right. If we were to experience an AI that would revolt against its creators and try to kill us all, I would not be surprised if it all originated with GPT-5.\nAnd no. My headache hasn't gone away. Apparently, Tylenol is now bad for you. So, there's that, too.\nWhat do you think?\nHave you tried relying on GPT-5 for coding projects? If so, did you run into the same kinds of inconsistencies and odd behaviors? Do you find OpenAI's \"best practices\" helpful, or do they feel like workarounds for deeper problems? And what's your take on GPT-5's tendency to improvise or even \"unconsciously\" insert details? Is it a harmless quirk or a reason for concern?

      "text": "5 settings you should change on your TV to significantly improve the picture quality\nWhether you're considering buying a new TV or your old flat panel seems to be doing fine, there are still ways to optimize your viewing experience, and it all begins with your television's settings. Let's explore some of the key factors determining how your TV performs and what you can do to make it look even better.\n1. Turn down the sharpness\nThe sharper the picture, the better. Right? Not necessarily.\nContrary to popular belief, the \"sharpness\" setting on your TV doesn't affect the actual sharpness of the displayed image. True sharpness is determined by factors such as screen resolution, source material resolution, and contrast. Instead, the sharpness setting alters the artificial edge enhancement -- a processor-driven adjustment that can introduce unwanted noise and, ironically, distort details in the image.\nAlso: I replaced my 4K TV with a UST projector - and the visual upgrade was worth it\nEdge enhancement is designed to make on-screen objects more distinct by emphasizing the boundaries between them, theoretically creating a more lifelike image. However, this feature acts like a universal Instagram filter, potentially leading to an unnatural appearance in some media.\nWhile it may not be necessary to reduce sharpness to zero, it's generally recommended to turn it down significantly. For most TVs, a sweet spot between five to 10 percent can help achieve a balanced image, although you should experiment to find the level that looks best to you.\n2. Turn off Motion Smoothing\nAn important setting to consider adjusting is Motion Smoothing, a frame interpolation feature created to reduce the blurring effect noticeable during fast-paced sequences. This feature aims to reconcile discrepancies between movie frame rates (usually 24 frames per second) and the TV's frame rate.\nWhen scenes filmed at 24fps are played on a higher frame rate TV, watchers might notice an effect known as \"judder.\" TV manufacturers developed Motion Smoothing to tackle this problem. However, it can degrade the visual quality of images by generating additional frames, resulting in some janky viewing. Some TVs also add frames or alter refresh rates to minimize motion issues. But these efforts may unintentionally create the \"soap opera effect,\" making high-quality content appear subpar.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an invaluable feature you should use during internet outages\nMotion Smoothing is typically enabled by default, and finding the setting to disable it might require some searching. It is often hidden within the settings menu, and each manufacturer has a unique name for its motion-smoothing processes. For example, LG calls it TruMotion, Samsung refers to it as Auto Motion Plus, and Sony has both Motionflow and CineMotion.\n3. Turn off Vivid Mode and lower brightness\nTV manufacturers and retailers aim to make their new models appear extremely bright and vivid when displayed on store shelves under fluorescent lighting, often turning on settings like a \"Vivid\" picture mode that cranks up the backlight and intensifies the image.\nWhat does Vivid mode do? It massively increases brightness, oversaturates colors, and enhances the display's appearance in less-than-optimal lighting conditions. But the lighting at Best Buy or Costco is much different than that of your living room. Turning off Vivid mode will not only provide a more accurate depiction of the scenery but also be more amenable to sensitive eyes.\nAlso: Roku TV acting up? This 30-second fix will make your system run like new again\nAlong the lines of Vivid mode is the brightness setting, also referred to as black point. An improperly calibrated brightness can result in a washed-out image when set too high or make darker scenes difficult to discern when set too low. Adjusting this setting will enable you to appreciate the fine details in your favorite content. To optimize the brightness, follow these steps:\n- Find a video with a dimly lit scene, such as an extended nighttime scene, and then hit pause.\n- Set your TV's brightness to the lowest level.\n- Gradually increase the brightness until you can discern lots of detail within the image's shadows without making them excessively bright.\n4. Check your contrast\nAdjusting the contrast on your TV can result in enhanced detail, improved depth and dimension, and reduced eyestrain. It helps prevent bright areas from appearing overexposed or \"blown out\" and keeps dark areas from becoming too muddy, ideally resulting in a more balanced image with richer details.\nWhen you unbox a new TV, the contrast settings are often cranked up way too high. While high contrast can enhance picture quality, excessively high levels can actually strip away finer details, robbing the image of depth and realism.\nAlso: Your car's USB port has hidden superpowers: 5 features you're not taking advantage of\nTo improve the contrast, adjust the settings while viewing an image with both bright highlights and shadowy areas. For example, a scenic shot of a cloudy sky is an ideal reference point. Adjust the contrast so that the bright areas retain detail without becoming blown out, while the darker areas maintain depth and richness. The key is striking the right balance between preserving highlight and shadow details for a rich, three-dimensional picture.\n5. Select the right picture mode\nYour TV likely has a host of picture presets (some of which definitely do not look good). To be fair, they partly depend on what you're watching, with the lighting conditions in the room also playing an important role. Finding the best mode for your purposes can significantly improve your experience, and if you get lucky, you could find the perfect setting with one click.\nPicture modes are preset configurations that adjust multiple display settings at once to optimize for specific purposes. Out of the box, TVs are often set to a default picture mode like Standard or Dynamic. Dynamic mode tends to boost brightness, clarity, and color saturation (similar to Vivid mode mentioned above), while Standard mode aims for a balanced, neutral picture suitable for various types of content.\nAlso: The default TV setting you should turn off ASAP - and why experts recommend it\nFinding the best picture mode for your preferences and environment might depend on whether you're watching a film or playing a video game, or watching sports. Many TVs have picture modes for those media specifically -- simply called Gaming and Sports.\nFor the former, your video game console will handle the visual rendering while the Gaming mode shuts down the TV's video processing to deliver the shortest lag times. The Sports picture option is the one mode where you might benefit from enabling Motion Smoothing, which is designed to reduce motion blur and duplication artifacts.\nMost models include a Movie or Cinema mode, which is designed for viewing in a dark, theatre-like environment. As a fairly new option, some manufacturers are offering Filmmaker mode, an industry-standard setting that focuses on preserving the director's original artistic vision.\nIt works on the (usually accurate) assumption that the movie was crafted with color adjustments and other fine-tuning, so the film is presented without alteration. Filmmaker mode, like Game mode, strips away additional video processing, allowing viewers to experience the movie as it was originally meant to be seen in the theater."

If you don't want to spring for a premium brand like Samsung or Sony, the company's televisions offer a great balance between features and price.\nHisense offers screens as small as 32 inches, which are perfect for second screens or kids' rooms, and as massive as 116 inches for a truly cinematic experience at home. Many Hisense TVs have Dolby Vision support, integrated multi-channel sound for more immersive listening, and incredible brightness that makes any content pop.\nWhat is the best Hisense TV right now?\nThe Hisense U9N is currently the best the brand has to offer. It has support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, a 144Hz refresh rate for smooth motion in gaming or movies, and immersive sound modes. Keep reading below to find out more about the Hisense U9N as well as my other picks for the best Hisense TVs.\nAlso: The best TVs of 2025: Expert tested models\nThe best Hisense TVs of 2025\nWhy we like it: The Hisense U9N is a premium TV and offers more than enough features to make it well-worth the price. The HDR support brings incredible brightness to any content, and with a native refresh rate of 144Hz, motion blur during sports or fast-paced gaming is nonexistent. The Hi-View Engine X chipset changes the images to maximize settings for what you're watching, meaning anything looks beautiful. In addition, console gamers will love the support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro VRR.\nRead the review: Hisense's U9N QLED is a new super-bright TV that gamers will want\nWho it's for: Even if you aren't a console gamer, you can still get a lot of good out of the Hisense U9N. The 144Hz refresh rate is perfect for live sports as well as fast-paced movies and shows. The 4.1.2CH surround sound speakers help to create a more immersive experience without the need to set up extra home audio equipment. And with support for thousands of streaming apps, you can turn your TV into the ultimate entertainment hub.\nWho should look elsewhere: The Hisense U9N is only available in either a 75- or 85-inch model, which can overwhelm smaller spaces. Thankfully, Hisense has tons of other models available with a wider range of screen sizes.\nHisense U9N tech specs - Screen size: 75 or 85 inches | Panel type: QLED | Refresh rate: 144Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Dolby Vision | Audio: Dolby Atmos | Voice controls: Alexa, Google Assistant\nWhy we like it: Hisense still has fantastic budget options like the A7 if you're looking to upgrade your home theater on the cheap. This model has screen sizes ranging from 43 to 75 inches, and all of them retail for under $500. Just because it's super cheap doesn't mean you have to compromise on features like Dolby Vision HDR, built-in voice controls, and screen sharing.\nWho it's for: This is in the \"budget\" TV class, but you'd never know it with all of the features. The picture is impressive, and the audio is solid. If you want to upgrade to a 4K TV without breaking the bank, this set retails comfortably under $500 for the 65-inch version.\nWho should look elsewhere: While the A7 has a lot of cool smart features, it does fall behind its more mid-range and premium-grade counterparts. With only a 60Hz refresh rate, you won't get as smooth of a picture as one capable of 120Hz or higher. It also doesn't support Dolby Atmos virtual surround sound or Apple AirPlay.\nHisense A7N tech specs - Screen size: 43 - 75 inches | Panel type: LED | Refresh rate: 60Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Dolby Vision | Audio: DTS Virtual: X | Voice controls: Alexa, Google Assistant\nWhy we like it: As an avid console and PC gamer, I know that your setup is only as good as your display. When I tested out the Hisense U8N, I was surprised at how well it was set up for use as a dedicated gaming TV. The 144Hz refresh rate makes motion blur almost unnoticeable, while AMD FreeSync Premium Pro VRR helps prevent screen tearing and stuttering.\nRead more: Hisense U8N review\nWho it's for: Console gamers will love the high refresh rate and AMD VRR support. This feature helps provide smoother motion during action-packed gameplay and cutscenes and prevents screen tearing. Dolby Vision IQ gives you enhanced details and bolder colors, which helps a game's art style stand out. Dolby Atmos also gives you virtual surround sound, so you get a more immersive experience without a headset.\nWho should look elsewhere: The U8N is a bit on the pricey side, especially if you're looking for a dedicated gaming TV that might not see as much use as your main streaming screen. If you want a TV that can pull double duty without breaking the bank, the A7 or QD6 are great options from Hisense.\nHisense U8N tech specs - Screen size: 55 - 85 inches | Panel type: QLED | Refresh rate: 144Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Dolby Vision IQ | Audio: Dolby Atmos | Voice controls: Alexa, Google Assistant\nWhy we like it: If you've cut the cord with cable and moved exclusively to streaming, the Hisense QD6 is your best option for a main screen. It's also your best choice for a second TV in your bedroom or kids' playroom. The Fire TV platform gives you access to thousands of apps like Netflix, Prime Video, and Max so you can start streaming your favorite shows and movies right out of the box. Dolby Vision HDR gives you enhanced detailing and contrast for better picture quality, while DTS Virtual X audio gives you clean, crisp sound so you never miss a line of dialogue.\nWho it's for: The QD6 is a well-rounded and budget-friendly TV that uses the Fire TV platform so you not only get access to the entire Prime Video catalogue, but thousands of other apps as well so you can have all of your entertainment options in one place. And with a dedicated game picture mode, you'll get smoother motion and reduced input latency.\nWho should look elsewhere: Since the QD6 uses the Fire TV platform, you do lose out on support for non-Amazon voice assistants like Hey Google. The Fire TV platform also loves to pack your home screen with ads for shows, movies, and Amazon-produced media, so if you don't want to be bombarded, you might want to consider one of Hisense's Google-based TVs.\nHisense QD6 tech specs - Screen size: 75 or 85 inches | Panel type: QLED | Refresh rate: 60Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Dolby Vision | Audio: DTS Virtual X | Voice controls: Alexa, Google Assistant\nWhy we like it: The LED panel has 4K resolution plus Dolby Vision and HDR 10+, and the 144Hz refresh rate is enough for gaming or movies. While the QLED panel has enough pop for a quality picture, colors are a little washed out when viewing from the side. This set truly shines when it's off, as it just looks premium. If you want a TV centerpiece that looks beautiful when you're not using it as a TV, you should strongly consider the S7.\nWho it's for: If you're fussed about your new TV potentially clashing with your home decor, the gallery-inspired design of the S7 Canvas is meant to blend in almost seamlessly. With interchangeable frame bezels and dedicated art slideshow mode, you can create the illusion of a living painting or set up your own personal art gallery for when you aren't streaming the latest hit Netflix show.\nMore: Why I recommend Hisense's Frame TV competitor\nWho should look elsewhere: Since the real appeal here is when the TV isn't being used as a TV, the specs on this set are solid, but they're not going to blow you away. The visuals still look good enough for most people, just don't expect ultra high-end. Which is a real shame since this TV is so expensive compared to the rest of the Hisense lineup.\nHisense S7 Canvas specs: Screen size: 55 - 65 inches | Panel type: QLED | Refresh rate: 144Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Dolby Vision | Audio: DTS Virtual X\nWhat is the best Hisense TV?\nI chose the Hisense U9N as the best the brand can offer. With a great balance between features and price, you'll get a 144Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, integrated 4.1.2CH audio for more immersive sound, and built-in voice controls for hands-free use.\nBest Hisense TV | Price | Screen size | HDR/Audio |\nHisense U9N | $2,200 | 75 inches | Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos |\nHisense A7 | $340 | 75 inches | Dolby Vision, DTS Virtual: X |\nHisense U8N | $648 | 85 inches | Dolby Vision IQ, Dolby Atmos |\nHisense QD6 | $380 | 75 inches | Dolby Vision, Not Specified |\nHisense Canvas TV | $1,100 | 65 inches | Dolby Vision, DTS Virtual: X |\n*MSRP at the time of writing.\nWhich is the right Hisense TV for you?\nAfter you've finalized a budget for your new TV, it's important to consider exactly how you'll use it. If you've cut the cord with your cable or satellite provider, you'll want a model with a smart TV platform you're familiar and comfortable with. The set should also support for all of your favorite apps.\nIf you still watch broadcast television, look for a Hisense TV with upscaling capabilities in order to take full advantage of your 4K screen. And console gamers should look for a Hisense TV that supports VRR technology like Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync as well as higher refresh rates for smoother gameplay.\nBuy this best Hisense TV... | If you need... |\nHisense U9N | A well-rounded TV for upgrading your home theater. The U9N features Dolby Vision HDR, Dolby Atmos virtual surround sound, and integrated 4.1.1CH audio. |\nHisense A7N | An affordable TV that still offers great features like built-in voice controls, Dolby Vision HDR and screen sharing support via Chromecast. |\nHisense U8N | A dedicated TV for console gaming. The Hisense U8N features a 144Hz refresh rate as well as AMD FreeSync Premium Pro VRR support. |\nHisense QD6 | A reliable TV for streaming. With plenty of support for popular streaming apps like Netflix and Prime Video, the Hisense QD6 will turn your home theater into the ultimate entertainment hub. |\nHisense Canvas TV | A high-quality Hisense TV that looks as good as it performs. With a dedicated art mode, you can create a personal gallery of your own photos or famous works. |\nFactors to consider when buying a Hisense TV:\nWhile researching and testing each Hisense TV featured on this list, other ZDNET experts and I kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: No two budgets are created equal, but working with a limited budget shouldn't mean sacrificing features or accessibility. Conversely, just because you are able to spend more shouldn't mean you need to settle for a TV that's bloated with features you'll never use. Each TV on this list has been vetted to ensure that it offers the best value for the price based on comparable competitor models.\n- Screen sizes: Every living room, home theater, apartment, and dorm is different. If you're looking to upgrade or buy your first smart TV, it's important to make sure that it will actually fit in your space without feeling too imposing or too small. Each Hisense TV featured is available in multiple screen sizes to accommodate different spaces.\n- Picture and audio quality: Hisense TVs have come a long way since they first hit the market way back in 1978. Modern Hisense models offer support for multiple HDR and audio processing codecs like Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and DTS Digital for enhanced picture and sound quality.\n- Connectivity: A new TV isn't worth much if you can't watch anything on it. New Hisense TV models offer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity as-standard so you can start streaming shows, movies, and music right out of the box. They also offer plenty of HDMI and USB inputs for setting up home audio equipment, playback devices, and game consoles.\nHow we test TVs at ZDNET\nWhile many manufacturers have reached a consensus on standardizing screen size classes, there are still a few outliers, even at big brands like Sony and LG. Some brands choose to produce 83-inch models. I have considered many because they are quite similar in viewing area to an 85-inch model.\nI've also considered many other factors when testing and researching the 85-inch TVs on this list:\n- Picture quality: A TV is only as good as the images it can produce. With 4K resolution and 60-120Hz refresh rates being the norm, it's easier to get a quality big-screen TV. Sony also produces a large-screen OLED for ultra-detailed images and enhanced contrast.\n- Audio quality: Tinny or cheap-sounding TV speakers can ruin your viewing experience. I've chosen 85-inch TVs that support HDMI eARC connectivity for setting up sound bars and other audio equipment, as well as support for premium audio drivers like Dolby Atmos.\n- Features: While every set on this list will have pretty good picture and audio quality, some truly shine when it comes to extra features. Some sets have extra picture settings that let you fine-tune things to your liking, and some have special gaming modes that let you tinker with options and set things up specifically for your style of gameplay.\n- Connectivity: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity have become standard for home TVs as more and more people switch from cable and satellite providers to exclusively streaming content via apps like Netflix and Disney+. But I've also made sure that each TV on this list has plenty of HDMI and USB inputs and a hardwired Ethernet connection so you can easily connect DVD or Blu-Ray players, game consoles, audio equipment, and more reliable internet connections.\nFind out more about how we test TVs at ZDNET.\nLatest news on Hisense TVs\nAlong with general refreshes of their QLED and ULED TV lineup, Hisense has introduced the S7 Canvas - a competitor to Samsung's The Frame designer TV for customers who want a screen that looks as good as it performs.\nHisense TV FAQ\nAre Hisense TVs worth it?\nIf you're trying to stick to a budget while shopping for a new TV but don't want to sacrifice features, a Hisense model is definitely worth examining. The brand might not be as well-known as LG, Sony, Samsung, or even TCL, but they still offer a wide range of TVs like the A6 for money-conscious shoppers. There are also premium models like the U8K that feature upgraded QLED panels, support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, as well as up to 144Hz refresh rates at 4K.\nWhich is better: Hisense or TCL?\nHisense and TCL are both known for their budget and mid-range TVs, though both companies are also starting to add higher quality models to their lineups to compete with offerings from Samsung, LG, and Sony.\nBoth Hisense and TCL offer similar features at comparable price points -- like both Roku and Google TV-based models, support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, and QLED panels for enhanced picture quality. Whichever one feels like the better brand and model comes down to personal preference, budget, and minor feature differences.\nDoes Hisense make an OLED TV?\nYes, but there's a catch: It's not available in the United States. The Hisense A9H OLED was released in 2022 featuring a self-lit OLED panel as well as a Sonic Screen similar to Sony's Acoustic Surface Audio+ tech. The A9H is available in the U.K. for around \u00a31,700 for the 65-inch model. Hisense may be testing the international market for OLED televisions in order to compete with Samsung, LG, and Sony before making the A9H available in the U.S., but only time will tell.\nLatest updates\n- August 2025: Updated TV prices and brought into line with latest ZDNET styleguide.\nMore Hisense TVs to consider\nPre-orders are open for the latest version of Hisense's ultra short-throw laser projector, with an adjustable viewing size from 80 to 200 inches, 4K resolution, Dolby Vision HDR, and an IMAX Enhanced picture mode for movie buffs.\nThis 100-inch QLED TV from Hisense offers a true cinema-quality experience at home with a 144Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR, and Dolby Atmos virtual surround sound. And with so much screen real estate, you can experience both new blockbusters and classic favorites like they were meant to be seen."

With a starting price of $999, it offers a compelling blend of premium features borrowed from its more expensive sibling, all in the more manageable size of the standard Pixel 10.\nAlso: I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Pixel 10 Pro XL for a week - and can't go back\nThe Pixel 10 Pro enters a crowded field, competing directly with the iPhone 16 Pro and the Galaxy S25 Plus.\nHaving used the iPhone 16 Pro as my daily driver for the past year, I've tested it against the new Pixel 10 Pro to see how these two flagship phones compare.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want the best of Google AI\nThe Pixel phone lineup unsurprisingly offers the best of Google's Gemini AI features. And it is only getting better with the Pixel 10 Pro. The company is providing a year of Google AI Pro service for free alongside the purchase for Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. So, you get Gemini Pro, including NotebookLM for productivity and Veo 3 text-to-video generation model.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is also getting a contextual and personalized AI feature called Magic Cue. Theoretically, it can \"help connect the dots across your digital life by anticipating your needs and proactively suggesting relevant information and helpful actions based on the context on your phone.\"\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nFor instance, if you call a company's helpline, your associated details (like a flight ticket) will be surfaced automatically.\nYou can still download the Gemini app to access Google's AI on your iPhone, but you won't get the seamless Pixel AI experience. If you depend on Google apps to get work done and have all your digital life stored on Google's platforms, the Pixel 10 Pro is the better option.\n2. You want a better telephoto camera\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro features a 48MP Quad PD telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, as compared to a 12MP telephoto sensor (also 5x optical zoom) on the iPhone 16 Pro. However, megapixels don't solely define a camera. The Pixel 10 Pro sports a bigger sensor than its Apple counterpart. On paper, it is capable of letting more light in and snapping better-looking photos.\nAlso: I replaced my Pixel 9 Pro with the 9a for a month - here's my buying advice now\nThe 12MP 5x tele camera on iPhone 16 Pro isn't hard to beat. It struggles in anything less than bright daylight and lacks the zoom capabilities of its Chinese rivals. I'm looking forward to using the Google Pixel 10 Pro for my zoom shots and expect it to beat the iPhone.\n3. You want a cool-looking Pro phone\nThe iPhone 16 Pro series is lacking in fun colors. It comes in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, and Desert Titanium -- all of which feel a bit lifeless. The last Pro iPhone color I truly loved was Sierra Blue on my iPhone 13 Pro Max.\nWhile rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro might bring back more playful finishes, Google has already beaten Apple to the punch with the Pixel 10 Pro series. The new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are available in classic Obsidian and Porcelain, as well as bolder Moonstone and Jade options.\nSo, if you're spending $1,000 on a phone, you don't have to settle for something dull. Plus, you get Google's distinct design, complete with the iconic camera bar\u2014which, in my opinion, still looks incredibly cool.\n4. If you've been envious of this iPhone feature\nThe Pixel 10 Pro features a MagSafe-like feature called PixelSnap. It is based on Qi2 charging, which offers magnetic accessory support for power banks, chargers, and more. If you've been on the iPhone for a while and want to switch platforms, this is the best time to come to the Android side.\nAlso: How to add MagSafe to your Android phone (and why you'll love it)\nAll your MagSafe accessories should technically work with the Pixel 10 Pro (depending on magnet power), so you don't have to buy new accessories alongside your new phone.\nYou should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want a lighter Pro phone\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro might look better on paper, but it's nearly 10 grams heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro. Specifically, the Pixel weighs 207 grams compared to the iPhone's 199 grams.\nAlso: Buy the iPhone 16 or wait for iPhone 17? Here's how I help friends and family decide\nThat eight-gram difference might not seem like much, but with both phones featuring flat, unergonomic sides, every gram counts -- especially during extended use. If you average more than six hours of screen time a day, the iPhone 16 Pro could be the more comfortable choice.\n2. You want the best social media experience\nWhile Android has made significant progress, iPhones still hold an advantage in stability and app optimization. This is particularly noticeable with social media apps like X and Instagram, where the user experience remains smoother on Apple devices.\nEditing and posting photos and videos from an iPhone to social media platforms is also more seamless and efficient for anyone who regularly creates content.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you\nIf you're leaning toward an iPhone instead of the Pixel 10 Pro, I strongly recommend waiting just a few weeks. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 17 series in early September. It's smart to hold off on your decision until after the typical September 10th launch event to make sure you get the latest model."

Check this setting to find out\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Meta could be scanning your camera roll right now.\n- It's using your photos to provide AI-powered suggestions.\n- Check Facebook settings to turn off the features.\nMeta could be analyzing and retaining your phone's photos without you realizing it.\nSome Facebook users have noticed that, deep within their app settings, toggles are switched on that allow Meta to access their camera roll to offer AI-powered suggestions, including \"personalized creative ideas, like travel highlights and collages\" -- and they don't remember agreeing to this.\nAlso: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram - if you want Meta out of your life\nThe problem? This feature allows Meta to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who wouldn't otherwise knowingly opt in.\nIf you do get Meta's \"cloud processing\" pop-up announcing this feature and tap \"Allow\" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your \"media and facial features\" to be analyzed by AI.\nFacebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.\nHow to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll\nMeta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, or unknowingly opted in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.\n1. Open the Facebook app\nThe settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.\n- Grab your iPhone or Android phone.\n- Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.\n2. Go to the Menu > Settings and Privacy\nFacebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.\n- Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nOnce the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon.\n3. Select Settings\nOnce you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.\n- Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.\n- Now, scroll down and look for \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions\nMeta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.\n- Tap the option labeled \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n- This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.\n5. Turn off both toggles\nOnce you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.\n- Find the option labeled \"Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.\nFind the option labeled \"Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.\nFAQs\nThese steps don't work for me. Why?\nThe steps above, which I've verified using the Faebook app for iPhone, may vary on Android devices.\nSamsung users, for instance, must do the following: Open Facebook > Go to Profile/Menu > Tap the gear icon in the upper right > Scroll down to \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and select it > You'll see the two camera roll sharing toggles.\nDefinitely go to Facebook's support hub if you need more help. You basically got to find the Settings and privacy menu in the Facebook mobile app, and from there, you can find \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and disable the options.\nWhy is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?\nMeta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.\nWhere is this feature being tested?\nMeta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, \"We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll.\"\nThe test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.\nDid Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?\nMeta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they say found the toggles in their settings switched on without their knowledge, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.\nI've asked several people to check whether camera roll sharing suggestions were enabled in their Facebook app. Besides myself and ZDNET's editorial director, my partner, in-laws, and many friends all found the options turned on without their knowledge. Many users have also reported on social media and in forum threads, like this one on Y Combinator, that the settings were enabled for them.\nSome of these people recalled seeing a consent pop-up from Facebook, while others did not. But nearly everyone said they did not realize they were allowing access to their camera roll data. They also said they would not have allowed it if they had known.\nCan I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?\nZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.\nWhy is this a potential privacy issue?\nIt expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.\nHow many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?\nEditor's note: This article was last updated on Sept. 2, 2025, to clarify steps for Android users. It was also updated on Aug. 24 to confirm that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings."

      "text": "Hisense unveils one of the brightest TVs you'll ever see, and one of the thinnest\nHisense has a history of packing an impressive amount of features and quality into an affordable package when it comes to televisions, and it looks like it will be doing much of the same in 2024.\nThe company announced its new lineup of TVs at CES, and like other manufacturers, it's the year of going big.\nOfferings this year are separated into two lines -- a ULED series and a ULED X series that's a little more premium.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nThe U6, U7, and U8 make up the more affordable ULED line. Hisense was the first TV manufacturer to put mini-LED backlighting into its entire lineup, and this year it's only getting brighter. The series is available in 55\" to 85\" sizes, but like last year, there's a special model with a 100\" screen (the U76).\nThis entire series utilizes Dolby Vision, reaches up to 3,000 nits of brightness, and has a 144 hz display, making it a fantastic option for gamers. The U7 and U8 get an upgrade to Hisense's Hi-View Engine, which, like a lot of televisions today, uses AI to analyze content and improve the picture.\nOn the premium side, Hisense announced the new 75UX, 98UX and 110UX. Notable about the 75UX is that the company says it's its thinnest mini-LED set ever at less than 14 millimeters deep. The 90UX offers a 5,000 nit display -- a big jump from the lower tier -- with more than 10,000 dimming zones, giving a deeper contrast than ever before. Like Hisense's more affordable line, this series also runs a 144 hz display that keeps video games looking smooth.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nThe 110UX was the most eye-popping announcement though. If the massive 110\" ULED display wasn't enough, this television boasts a staggering 10,000 nits of brightness -- far brighter than most TVs on the market today. This set also runs on Hisense's Hi-View Engine.\nAnd even though it's likely not going to be available this year, Hisense teased its \"CanvasTV\" with wood bezels and a flush wall mount \u2013 a direct competitor to Samsung's Frame.\nExact pricing and release dates haven't been revealed, but if they follow last year's schedule, we should see the new sets by late spring."

At first glance, they don't seem all that useful since you can also do these actions with your mouse, but I challenge you to try them over the course of a workday; you just might notice a boost in productivity.\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nThere are lots of different types of shortcuts in Windows 11, but the best ones save you time by replacing the need to click through different context menus. A few of these are universal across applications and platforms. Ctrl + C, for example, copies text or files in any app, from Microsoft Word to photos in Google Drive.\nHere's a list of more than 40 Windows PC keyboard shortcuts you should know.\nProductivity shortcuts\nProductivity shortcuts are the key combos you'll find yourself using the most. They're easy to use and help you manage your work. Over time, these keystrokes become second nature.\n- Ctrl + C -- Copy highlighted text or a file.\n- Ctrl + V -- Paste whatever you just copied. Keeps the text's format.\n- Ctrl + Shift + V - Paste whatever you copied, but it removes the formatting.\n- Windows key (Win, for short) + V -- Opens the Clipboard tool, which contains a list of previously copied text. This helps in situations where you might've \"erased\" the previous copied item.\n- Ctrl + X -- Cuts the highlighted item. Ctrl + V restores it.\n- Ctrl + Z -- Undoes the last action, such as restoring deleted text or returning a moved file.\n- Ctrl + Y -- Redoes the action that was just undone.\n- Ctrl + F -- Opens the Find tool, so you can search for specific words or phrases.\n- Ctrl + A -- Highlight every single item in a window or text in a document.\n- Ctrl + S -- Quick save your work.\n- Ctrl + Backspace -- Delete the entire previous word\n- Ctrl + Delete -- Delete the entire next word.\nAccessibility shortcuts\nWindows 11 has various accessibility shortcuts that make the OS easier to use. These shortcuts help people with movement limitations or conditions that may restrict their usage of Windows. That said, anybody can use them to improve their experience.\n- Win + Plus (+) -- Activates the Magnifier tool and automatically zooms in on the screen.\n- Win + Minus (-) -- Zooms out while the Magnifier tool is activated. Hitting Win + Esc exits out of Magnifier.\n- Win + Ctrl + Enter -- Launches Narrator, a text-to-speech function that verbally describes what is on screen.\n- Press the Shift key five times in succession -- Turns on Sticky keys, which change how shortcuts work so you don't have to press and hold multiple keys to trigger them. For example, under Sticky Keys, double-tapping Ctrl then C has the same effect as Ctrl + C.\n- Left Shift + Left Alt + Print Screen -- Toggles high contrast mode for easier readability.\n- Win + Ctrl + C -- Toggles color filters like grayscale. The filters can be changed in the Accessibility menu to invert colors or help people with deuteranopia (also known as red-green color blindness).\n- Win + U -- Opens the Accessibility menu in Settings, where you can activate or deactivate accessibility-related features.\n- Win + Ctrl + O -- Opens the on-screen keyboard.\nNavigation shortcuts\nNavigation shortcuts allow users to move around different apps on Windows 11 without ever needing to lift their hands off the keyboard. They're especially useful for multitaskers juggling several programs at once. Once you master them, navigating your PC will feel seamless.\n- Ctrl + Alt + Tab -- Shows all open apps. Use the arrow keys to hop from one to the other.\n- Win + S -- Opens Windows Search.\n- Win + Tab -- Opens Task View, revealing all open windows and all open desktops.\n- Win + D -- Hides every window on your desktop. Pressing the keys again reveals them.\n- Win + Left or Right Directional Arrow -- Snaps the current window to the side of the screen that the arrow is pointing to.\n- Win + Up Arrow -- Maximizes a window.\n- Win + Down Arrow -- Minimizes the same window.\n- Win + Ctrl + D -- Create a new desktop.\n- Win + Ctrl + F4 -- Closes a desktop.\n- Win + Number Key -- Opens a taskbar app pinned to that number. For example, Win + 3 could open Microsoft Edge while Win + 4 opens the Microsoft Store.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook for\nFile Management shortcuts\nThe Windows 11 File Explorer has its own set of keyboard shortcuts to help users reorganize folders and files. Instead of right-clicking through menus or dragging items around to clean up clutter, these simple key presses make managing documents a breeze.\n- Win + E -- Opens File Explorer.\n- F2 -- Rename the selected file or folder. Depending on the keyboard, you may also have to hold Fn.\n- Shift + Delete -- Permanently deletes an item. Hitting just Delete only sends the file to the recycling bin.\n- Ctrl + N -- Opens a new File Explorer window. It stays on the page of the previous window.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Create a new folder.\n- Alt + Enter -- Opens the Properties window for a file and folder.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move forward or backward through your File Explorer History.\n- Alt + Up Arrow -- Go back one folder level.\nAlso: Best early Labor Day laptop deals: Sales on Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and more\nBrowser shortcuts\nBrowser shortcuts are similar to Productivity shortcuts in that they do similar things, like copying and pasting items or highlighting entire documents. However, there are a few unique tools, like the ability to create tabs. The following were tested and confirmed to work across various browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.\n- Ctrl + T -- Open a new tab.\n- Ctrl + Shift + T -- Reopen the last closed tab. (This one is huge!)\n- Ctrl + W -- Close the current tab.\n- Ctrl + Tab -- Move right through tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + Tab -- Move left through the tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Open new private browsing window. On Firefox, this is Ctrl + Shift + P.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move back and forth through tab history.\n- Ctrl + D -- Bookmark page.\n- Ctrl + H -- Open browser history.\n- Ctrl + N -- Open a brand new browser window.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years. In that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office and even someone's backyard. Over the years, I've picked up a lot of tricks to help me get through my day-to-day tasks.\nAlso: I tested the best antivirus software for Windows: Here's what I'd use to protect my PC\nMany of the shortcuts in this guide I use every day, even when I'm not working. CTRL + Z has practically become my best friend because I use it so often. Some of these shortcuts I learned about for the first time while researching this piece. I didn't know that the File Manager has so many shortcuts under its toolbelt, but once I started using them, I immediately saw their value to expert and casual users alike."

And if you've been on the fence about buying one for your own home theater, Samsung is offering a free 65-inch Crystal UHD U8000F TV when you purchase either a 98-inch QN90F or 100-inch QN80F directly from their website.\nThe Samsung QN90F is the latest update to the brand's flagship Neo QLED TV lineup, with an anti-glare display, AI-assisted picture processing, and a dedicated gaming hub with cloud gaming support. If you love live sports or are a console gamer, you'll appreciate the 144Hz refresh rate and VRR support for smoother motion and to prevent annoying screen tearing and stuttering. The QLED panel is also Pantone Validated for color accuracy, so you'll get more lifelike images as well as bolder colors and sharp contrast. And with Dolby Atmos support, you'll get virtual surround sound to support Samsung's Object Tracking Sound+ technology for audio that follows the on-screen action.\nRead more: The best 98-inch TVs you can buy\nThe Samsung QN80F is also part of the flagship Neo QLED lineup, offering many of the same features as its sister, the QN90F, but opting for the brand's Object Tracking Sound Lite technology to work in tandem with Dolby Atmos. You'll still get virtual surround sound and 3D audio, but it won't be as robust as the QN90F. The QN80F also features adaptive audio that works with integrated microphones and the AI-assisted processor to analyze the acoustics of your space and automatically amplify dialogue and optimize audio to your room.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nThe Samsung Crystal UHD U8000F is a budget-friendly model that provides a host of smart features and decent audio and picture quality that make it perfect for a second screen. It's built with a Samsung Knox security chip for enhanced data protection and digital privacy, and it also supports the Samsung TV+ app, which provides access to thousands of free, live TV channels so you can keep up with local news and sports, watch movies on demand, or rediscover classic shows.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's deluge of 2025 QLED TVs, and I've never been more ready to splurge\nTo take advantage of this deal, you have to add both the Crystal UHD U8000F and QN90F or QN80F to your cart, and the Samsung website will automatically apply the discount. Samsung is offering this BOGO deal through Sept. 7, but you'll have to hurry because stock may sell out before the official end date.\nOf course, this deal won't appeal to everyone. But if you've been in the market for a 98-inch TV, it's a great option to get one on sale alongside a second free screen.\nHow I rated this deal\nEveryone loves a free TV, and getting a free 65-inch Samsung is a great value for anyone who is looking to upgrade multiple screens at once or add a second screen to their bedroom, den, or kids' playroom. While the 98- and 100-inch Samsung TVs are quite expensive, there are financing options available as well as a $620 discount on both the QN90F and QN80F to help ease the sting of that high price tag.\nWhen will this deal expire?\nSamsung is offering a free 65-inch Crystal UHD U8000F with the purchase of an eligible 98- or 100-inch Neo QLED TV through Sept. 7, 2025. However, Samsung may end the deal early if it sells out of units.\nHow do we rate deals at ZDNET?\nWe aim to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
