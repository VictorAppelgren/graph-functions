  "description": "The El Salvador-born migrant was ordered to report to ICE custody on Monday, and could be deported to Uganda in the future.",
  "content": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys say federal prosecutors offered him a deal that would see him deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges before he was released from jail on Friday, but are now threatening to send him to the African nation of Uganda as early as next week. The El Salvador-born migrant was ordered to report to ICE custody on Monday, and could be deported to Uganda in the future. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\n\nAbrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador but lived in Maryland when the Trump administration mistakenly deported him in March, was released from federal custody Friday but still faces trial on criminal charges brought by the administration during his controversial removal. Federal prosecutors offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty and served \u201cany sentence imposed by the Court,\u201d his attorneys said in a filing on Saturday\u2014an offer they called a \u201clast-ditch effort to forestall\u201d his eventual release on Friday. Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers also filed a letter from Costa Rica\u2019s ministry of public security, confirming they received an offer from the U.S., and would provide Garcia with refugee status and not seek to detain or deport him back to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released to his family in Maryland on Friday. On Friday afternoon, government attorneys notified Abrego Garcia to report to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement custody in Baltimore on Monday, and that he could be sent to Uganda \u201cno earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),\u201d according to a pair of letters attached by Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers to the filing. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia argued that the efforts show both the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security were \u201cworking in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea,\u201d calling the efforts \u201cvindictive\u201d and asking for the case to be dismissed.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a sheet metal apprentice and father of three living in Maryland, became one of the most visible individuals impacted by the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts after court filings revealed his deportation to El Salvador and imprisonment in the country\u2019s controversial CECOT prison came after an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d The Trump administration doubled down on the deportation and stalled efforts to return him to the country, insisting that Abrego Garcia was linked to the notorious gang MS-13. Abrego Garcia finally returned to the U.S. in June to face federal charges over an alleged conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens. The charges, which were brought by a federal grand jury indictment, relate to a 2022 incident when Abrego Garcia was stopped for speeding in Tennessee with eight passengers in a vehicle. Abrego Garcia told officers that the passengers were other construction workers. He was not charged with anything at the time and given a warning after officers noted he was driving with an expired driver\u2019s license. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.",

      "text": "Topline\nKilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man whom the Trump administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador\u2014but repeatedly insisted would not be brought back\u2014has returned to U.S. after all after the Trump administration indicted him on charges of transporting undocumented immigrants, after repeatedly claiming without evidence he belonged to gang MS-13.\nKey Facts\nAbrego Garcia is now back in the U.S., Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed at a press conference Friday, after a federal grand jury indicted him on two criminal charges for conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens.\nHe has been indicted based on allegations that he participated in a years-long scheme to transport undocumented migrants from the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas to interior parts of the U.S., according to a court filing made public on Friday, with Bondi claiming the alleged activities were Abrego Garcia\u2019s \u201cfull-time job.\u201d\nThe indictment also makes more serious allegations against Abrego Garcia, including that he was a member of MS-13, trafficked firearms and narcotics, and allegedly abused women who were being transported, but he was not charged based on any of those allegations, and Bondi said Friday they are so far just allegations made by other co-conspirators in the case.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s return comes after the Trump administration had repeatedly insisted it could not bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S.\u2014despite an order from the Supreme Court to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return\u2014claiming the immigrant was out of the government\u2019s jurisdiction now that he was in El Salvador.\nBondi told reporters Friday that El Salvador\u2019s government had allowed Abrego Garcia to return to the country, despite previous claims from President Nayib Bukele that he could not have the man returned.\nAbrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March despite a 2019 court ruling prohibiting the government from deporting him there due to fears of persecution, and while the Trump administration admitted in court filings that the man\u2019s deportation was an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d the government has dug its heels in on the deportation, claiming Abrego Garcia is a \u201ccriminal\u201d whose deportation was warranted.\nTrump Officials Repeatedly Said They Would Not Bring Abrego Garcia Back To The U.s.\nThe Trump administration insisted prior to Abrego Garcia\u2019s indictment he would not be brought back to the United States. Bondi said in April that Abrego Garcia was \u201cnot coming back to our country,\" and said that if Bukele returned him, the U.S. would send him back to El Salvador. (Bukele said days prior to Bondi\u2019s comment he did not have the authority to return him.) Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during a March testimony to Congress that Abrego Garcia \u201cwill never\u201d return to the U.S., saying if \u201che were to come back to this country, he would be immediately removed again.\u201d Similarly, White House\u2019s immigration lead, Stephen Miller, said in an Oval Office meeting with Trump that if Bukele returned Abrego Garcia, \u201che would be deported the second time to El Salvador,\" and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \u201cThere is never going to be a world in which this is an individual who is going to live a peaceful life in Maryland.\u201d\nWhat To Watch For\nAbrego Garcia will now be prosecuted in the U.S. for his criminal charges, and it\u2019s unclear how long that could take. Bondi said Friday that Abrego Garcia will return to El Salvador after his prosecution is over and he finishes serving any potential sentence, if convicted.\nWhat Does The Indictment Allege?\nThe indictment alleges Abrego Garcia and other alleged co-conspirators \u201cconspired to bring undocumented aliens to the U.S. from countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador and elsewhere,\u201d despite knowing they were undocumented. Abrego Garcia allegedly \u201cknowingly and unlawfully\u201d transported \u201cthousands\u201d of undocumented migrants, charging them money for the transportation, the indictment alleges, and the government claims Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators worked with known criminal groups including MS-13. The indictment also alleges Abrego Garcia would sometimes transport firearms and narcotics for resale in Maryland, and that he and his co-conspirators would intentionally change their routes and use cover stories to evade detection. Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators allegedly transported people using \u201cunsafe\u201d methods, such as transporting children in the \u201cfloorboards of vehicles.\u201d The indictment also details an alleged instance in which Abrego Garcia and others were pulled over by law enforcement in Tennessee, and Abrego Garcia allegedly lied and said they were traveling from working on a construction job in St. Louis.\nWho Is Kilmar Abrego Garcia?\nAbrego Garcia is a father of three who lived with his wife and children in Maryland before being deported in March. He first entered the U.S. illegally at age 16 in 2012, and had resided in the country since, going on to marry a U.S. citizen. In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested in the parking lot of a Home Depot on allegations that he and other people were \u201cloitering,\u201d and law enforcement accused him of being a member of MS-13, citing the fact he was wearing Chicago Bulls clothing. Abrego Garcia and his family have denied that he has any associations with the gang, and experts cited by the BBC have cast doubt on the Trump administration\u2019s evidence tying him to MS-13. He was not charged at the time with any crimes. A judge granted Abrego Garcia \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d in 2019, which gave him temporary protections from deportation and work authorization in the U.S., and prohibited the government from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador specifically, given the possibility he could face gang violence if he returned. Abrego Garcia was then pulled over by immigration enforcement officials on March 12 and subsequently detained and sent to El Salvador, prompting a legal battle over his removal that had not yet been resolved as of his reported return to the U.S.\nKey Background\nAbrego Garcia has become a focal point in the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to clamp down on immigration and ramp up deportations. The Maryland man was one of hundreds of people removed from the U.S. through deportation flights this year that Trump carried out under an 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act. The deportations, which included people with no criminal records, have been challenged in court, with a federal judge ruling last month the Trump Administration could not use the Alien Enemies Act to deport people it alleged were gang members. Deportation flights reached their highest point of Trump\u2019s second term last month, according to The New York Times. The president has declared a national emergency at the southern border, bringing in U.S. military forces to supplement Border Patrol agents. Trump has also revoked thousands of international student visas in the wake of pro-Palestinian protests throughout several U.S. colleges last year and recently issued a travel ban on over a dozen countries mostly located in the Middle East and Africa, citing national security and public safety concerns."

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump insisted Tuesday a photoshopped image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2014who the administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador\u2014proves he was an MS-13 gang member, doubling down on a conspiracy the president promoted earlier this month on social media.\nKey Facts\nTrump, in a contentious exchange with ABC News\u2019 Terry Moran, insisted that Moran agree with him that Abrego Garcia has \u201cM, S, 1, 3\u201d tattooed above his knuckles, citing an obviously doctored image Trump shared twice on social media earlier this month to prove Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang, despite scant evidence, no criminal record in the U.S. and his lawyers and family members denying any gang affiliation.\n\u201cTerry, do you want me to show you the picture? He had M, S, as clear as you can be, not interpreted,\u201d Trump said as Moran tried to change the subject to Ukraine.\nThe claim stems from tattoos Abrego Garcia has on his knuckles that show a marijuana leaf, a smiley face with \u201cx\u201d over the eyes, a cross and a skull\u2014his tattoos do not include the actual \u201cMS-13\u201d stamp, according to an image El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted of Abrego Garcia meeting with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., in El Salvador.\nSome social media users have suggested the marijuana leaf represents \u201cM,\u201d the smiley face represents \u201cS\u201d and the cross and skulls are cover-ups for a \u201c1\u201d and \u201c3,\u201d though Trump seemed to insist during Tuesday\u2019s interview the actual letters and numbers were tattooed on Abrego Garcia\u2019s hands.\nTrump fueled speculation that there could be hidden meaning behind the tattoos when he posted a photo of himself from the Oval Office holding an image of Abrego Garcia\u2019s hand with \u201cM, S, 1, 3\u201d pasted above each knuckle on April 18 and again on April 21, writing \u201cthis is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States.\u201d\nThe White House, when asked if Trump believes Abrego Garcia actually has \u201cM S 1 3\u201d tattooed on his knuckles, said \u201cask any law or immigration enforcement official who\u2019s been on the ground about Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s tattoos: they\u2019re MS-13.\u201d\nContra\nSome gang experts told CBS it\u2019s unclear whether Abrego Garcia\u2019s tattoos include any MS-13 symbolism. University of Nevada Assistant Professor Robert Lovato said he spoke to current gang members who said they don\u2019t believe Abrego Garcia\u2019s tattoos represent MS-13. Multiple experts noted that symbols used by gangs in tattoos, such as a skull, are also used by the general public.\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cThat was photoshopped? Terry, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d Trump said during the ABC special marking his 100th day in office Tuesday. \u201cHe had \u2018MS-13\u2019 tattooed. Terry . . . Terry. Do you want me to show you the picture?\u201d\nTangent\nTrump told ABC he \u201ccould\u201d bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., contradicting government lawyers\u2019 claims that the decision rests with El Salvador.\nKey Background\nAbrego Garcia was deported in March to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order allowing him to stay in the country after a judge found he could be targeted by gangs if he returned to his home country. He was deported because the document Immigration and Customs Enforcement used to determine the final list of deportees slated for one of the March 15 flights to El Salvador did not note his protected status, an ICE official recently admitted in court. A district court judge ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., and the Supreme Court said the administration must \u201cfacilitate\u201d his release, but government lawyers have claimed the decision is in El Salvador\u2019s hands since he is a citizen there and in the custody of the Salvadoran government. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, meanwhile, has suggested he can\u2019t return Abrego Garcia without U.S. approval. Trump administration officials have pointed to an interview police who detained Abrego Garcia in a Home Depot parking lot in Hyattsville, Maryland, in 2019 conducted with a confidential informant who said Abrego Garcia was a member of the Long Island-based outpost of the gang, despite his lawyers saying he\u2019s never been to New York. The detective also noted in court documents released by the Trump administration that Abrego Garcia was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents\u2019 faces printed on the bills, which the detective said is clothing sometimes affiliated with gang culture.\nFurther Reading\nWhite House Doubles Down On Erroneous Deportation Of Maryland Dad (Forbes)"

      "text": "Topline\nKilmar Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration early this year, was released from custody in Tennessee on Friday, according to multiple outlets, heading back home to Maryland as the Trump administration threatens to deport him again.\nKey Facts\nAbrego Garcia is on his way to reunite with his family in Maryland for the first time since his deportation in March, Fox 17 reported.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys recently said he would be transported by a private security firm with \u201cexperience providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in criminal cases.\u201d\nThe Maryland man is awaiting a Jan. 27 trial on human smuggling charges that he has pleaded not guilty to.\nAbrego Garcia is \u201cgrateful that his access to American courts has provided meaningful due process,\u201d according to a statement from lawyer Sean Hecker reported by multiple outlets.\nThe Trump administration said last month it would try to undo Abrego Garcia\u2019s temporary deportation protections and deport him to a third country before his trial.\nHours after Abrego Garcia\u2019s release, the Department of Homeland Security informed his attorneys that ICE \u201cmay\u201d deport him to the African country of Uganda, according to Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin, who cited federal sources and documents.\nForbes has reached out to Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys for comment.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

The Justice Department admitted in a filing his deportation was caused by an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Abrego Garcia was deported because of a \u201cclerical error.\u201d Xinis said Abrego Garcia was deported without legal justification, ordering his return and noting he was granted withholding of removal in 2019 after fleeing from gang violence in El Salvador in 2011. The Trump administration later accused Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 member, baselessly claiming his hand tattoos proved the association. The Supreme Court eventually stepped in, ordering the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return to the U.S. He was brought back to the U.S. in June after several White House officials insisted he would not return. The day Abrego Garcia returned, he was detained on human smuggling charges linked to a 2022 traffic stop for speeding with eight passengers. Abrego Garcia was not charged with anything during the stop and given a warning about an expired driver\u2019s license. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty and will go to trial in January."

      "text": "Topline\nAttorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia want their client kept in a Tennessee jail over fears the federal government may try to deport him before his trial on human smuggling charges, according to multiple outlets, casting doubt on the Justice Department\u2019s purported plans to instead try Abrego Garcia on the charges before deporting him.\nKey Facts\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys asked the judge on Friday to extend the Maryland man\u2019s stay in jail because the Justice Department \u201chas made directly contradictory statements on this issue in the last 18 hours, and because we cannot put any faith in any representation made on this issue by the DOJ.\u201d\nThe lawyers were referencing a statement reportedly made by a Justice Department attorney Thursday who told a judge the U.S. wants to deport Abrego Garcia deported to a \u201cthird country\u201d\u2014instead of El Salvador, where he was initially deported in March.\nLater, Justice Department spokesman Chad Gilmartin told the Associated Press it intended to try Abrego Garcia on the smuggling charges before any deportation was carried out.\nThere is not a trial date for Abrego Garcia on the federal smuggling charges.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s previously asked the Tennessee judge to order the man\u2019s return to Maryland, where he would stay with his brother, as a way to prevent his deportation, according to Politico.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nWhat Are Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s Charges?\nAbrego Garcia was indicted by a federal grand jury on two criminal charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens, counts linked to a 2022 traffic stop in which he was pulled over for speeding. Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged Abrego Garcia\u2019s activities were part of a \u201cfull-time job.\u201d Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported in March to El Salvador, was brought back to the U.S. after the Trump administration revealed the charges. Previously, multiple Trump officials and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele insisted they did not have the power or authority to bring Abrego Garcia back to U.S. soil.\nKey Background\nAbrego Garcia worked as a construction worker in Maryland before his deportation in March, living with his wife and three children. He was granted withholding of removal in 2019, providing him temporary protections from deportation and work authorization. The deportation protection is a crux within the lawsuit challenging his removal from the U.S., which became a flashpoint for President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping anti-immigration agenda. The Trump administration did not charge Abrego Garcia with a crime when he was deported, arguing in the proceeding weeks his removal was justified because he was allegedly a member of the MS-13 gang. His attorneys have denied associations with the gang.\nFurther Reading\nHere\u2019s How Many Times The White House Insisted Abrego Garcia Wouldn\u2019t Be Brought Back To The U.S. (Forbes)"

The Government of Costa Rica intends to provide refugee status or residency to Mr. Abrego Garcia upon his transfer to Costa Rica. The Government of Costa Rica assures the Government of the United States of America that, consistent with that lawful immigration status and Costa Rican law, it does not intend to detain Mr. Abrego Garcia upon his arrival in Costa Rica. The Government of Costa Rica further assures the Government of the United States of America that it will not remove Mr. Abrego Garcia to any third country, including Mr. Abrego Garcia's home country, without Mr. Abrego Garcia's consent. The Government of Costa Rica intends to treat Mr. Abrego Garcia in a manner that is consistent with its obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, done at Geneva on July 28, 1951; the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, done at New York on January 31, 1967; the Convention against Torture DESPAC H O MI N ISTRO DE SEGURIDA D PUBLICA So n Jose.

  "argos_summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El\u202fSalvador by the Trump administration, has been released from federal custody after being indicted on human\u2011smuggling charges.  His attorneys claim prosecutors offered a deal to deport him to Costa\u202fRica if he pleaded guilty, but have now warned that he could be sent to Uganda instead.  Court filings show Costa\u202fRica\u2019s willingness to grant him refugee status and that ICE has notified his lawyers he must report to Baltimore and could be removed to Uganda within 72 hours.  The case highlights the U.S. government\u2019s attempts to coerce a guilty plea while simultaneously threatening further deportation to a third country.",
