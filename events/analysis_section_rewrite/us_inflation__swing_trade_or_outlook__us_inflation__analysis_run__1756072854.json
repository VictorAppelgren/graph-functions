      "feedback": "Your draft has a solid three-regime framing and credible data anchors, but to reach world‑class quality, tighten the Movers/Scenarios into four exact lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with a single, clear horizon, and attach probabilities strictly to regime-linked outcomes; drop the Neutral line and ensure each line rests on a single driver (Regime A, B, or C or tariff/auto shock) with a crisp causal chain to price and policy catalysts; explicitly anchor the four lines to measurable catalysts (e.g., Jackson Hole guidance, wage/inflation signals, August trade/export ratios, tariff pass‑through) and attach ID citations to every numeric claim or asserted fact; make the probabilities consistent with the text (e.g., Regime A ~22–28% depending on the line, Regime B ~28%, Regime C ~25%, tariff/autos shock ~25% using NL5YYTLF2, EPJYXB7DX, 0J41Q7KTX, S15934PBQ, CDBMWIUTB, U6HXAJR4J); ensure each line uses the exact required format: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability%; for Down lines, tie to a concrete invalidation (e.g., hawkish shift or tariff escalation) and for Up lines to credible policy or productivity progress, with one short, testable trigger per line. Then convert the outlook into a Swing Trade if Ford is tradable: add a single line (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability% | Confidence%), preferably anchored to Ford’s 5% yield and ~8–10x forward P/E (with cited sources like 5.18% yield, 8–10x P/E, 1.3B EV losses) and a neutral-to-positive EV-cycle outlook, plus explicit price/technical levels and a stop under a tracked support. Finally, enforce a concise source‑conflict reconciliation: pick one coherent valuation anchor (e.g., Ford’s dividend/cash‑flow thesis with ROIC discipline from 22PL3Q360) and note any conflicts (e.g., yield vs P/E ranges) with a brief tie‑back to NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, EPJYXB7DX, and S15934PBQ, so every factual claim has an ID and the overall map remains auditable.",
