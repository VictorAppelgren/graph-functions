  "content": "Morning everyone.New South Wales\u2019s environment watchdog failed to reveal for four years a report linking elevated levels of lead in children\u2019s blood to current mining, new documents reveal.\n\nPlus: Australian Indians are bewildered and concerned by the hostility towards their community by anti-immigration campaigners. Elsewhere, Giorgio Armani has been remembered as the man most responsible for the way we dress after he death at 91, and in sporting news Collingwood have silenced the Adelaide crowd.\n\u2022 \u2018Why us?\u2019 | In the wake of the anti-immigration marches, Amar Singh (above) \u2013 a one-time Australian of the Year local hero award winner \u2013 and others remain shocked and concerned over the racist targeting of Australia\u2019s Indian diaspora community. \u201cWe pay our taxes.

He was 91. Our fashion editor says he was the architect of how we dress and our obituary highlights, among other things, how Richard Gere\u2019s outfits in American Gigolo made the brand\u2019s reputation.\n\u2022 Trump \u2018danger\u2019 | The world during Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency has entered a period of danger with \u201ccertain similarities to the 30s\u201d, especially in foreign policy, according to Mitch McConnell, the veteran Republican former Senate leader.

Much more important, argues Prof Peter Whiteford, a public policy expert, is the impact it has had on many of the victims \u2013 with trauma for very many, including some deaths by suicide. It has been called \u201cthe social engineering of shame\u201d.\n\nWith their debut album Now Would Be A Good Time released during their current European and UK tour, the Melbourne indie band Folk Bitch Trio tell Katie Cunningham about the vicissitudes of rock\u2019n\u2019roll and singing about \u201cthe turmoils of being in your 20s, and the pathetic little tragedies that you have\u201d.\n\u2022 AFL | Collingwood blocked out the noise from a raucous home crowd at the Adelaide Oval to beat the Crows by 24 points and advance to the preliminary final, thanks largely to a devastating 15-minute burst in the third quarter.\n\u2022 Football | Sam Kerr is poised to make her long-awaited return for Chelsea on Friday night (Saturday in Australia) after 20 months out because of a serious knee injury when the Women\u2019s Super League season gets under way.\n\u2022 Rugby union | England\u2019s women have warned that they will be \u201cpredators not prey\u201d as Australia go into their Ashes clash against the hosts at the women\u2019s World Cup on Saturday needing to win.\n\u2022 Tennis | Novak Djokovic stands in the way of Carlos Alcaraz reaching his third grand slam final in a row when they take to the court in the US Open on Friday New York time.\n\nThe Age reports details on a series of meetings Daniel Andrews has held with Chinese business figures in the past year.

      "text": "Carlos Alcaraz took his final leave from Rod Laver Arena this year consumed by frustration. Losing at the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, was painful enough, but Alcaraz\u2019s disappointment was particularly down to how he had lost.\nNovak Djokovic had visibly begun to struggle with a leg injury early in their four-set quarter-final, but instead of focusing on his own game, Alcaraz found himself staring across the net and thinking too much about his opponent\u2019s condition rather than about what he needed to win. While the Spaniard\u2019s focus wavered, Djokovic\u2019s difficulties inspired his most offensive, decisive tennis, and he willed himself to a miraculous victory.\nThat meeting was the last encounter in what has become one of the most unusual rivalries the sport has seen. At 38 and 22 respectively, Djokovic and Alcaraz were born 16 years apart. Their first meeting at the Madrid Open in May 2022, won by Alcaraz, occurred two days after his 19th birthday and two weeks before Djokovic turned 35. Considering that significant age gap, just one match between them would have been a fortunate outcome.\nInstead, when they enter Arthur Ashe Stadium for their semi-final match on Friday, they will have met on every single major stage in professional tennis: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, the Olympic Games and ATP Finals. Djokovic leads their head-to-head 5-3 and those meetings have included some of the most memorable matches in the sport, from Alcaraz\u2019s recovery to win his first Wimbledon title in 2023 to Djokovic\u2019s career\u2011completing Olympic gold medal triumph last year.\nThe contrasting dynamics of their careers have always been at the forefront of this match, with the Serb desperately fighting to maintain his high level despite his advancing age while Alcaraz attempts to mature and grow as he moves closer to his physical peak.\nThis tournament has underscored both of those challenges. After spending his early years succeeding despite his wavering focus and impulsive shot selection, Alcaraz has never been more consistent. The 22\u2011year\u2011old is seeking to reach an eighth consecutive final and a third major final in a row. The confidence he has gained from an immense summer has afforded him his first run to a grand slam semi-final without dropping a set. Alongside his improved concentration and clarity of thought on each point, the development of Alcaraz\u2019s serve into an increasingly consistent weapon has been invaluable.\nDjokovic, meanwhile, has reached a point in his career where he simply does not know how his body will respond to the difficulties of trying to compete against the best players in the world across a gruelling grand slam tournament while in best\u2011of\u2011five\u2011sets format. His physical difficulties at the grand slam tournaments throughout this year have been clear warning signs. However, he is still performing at such a high level and he is as resilient as ever, which he reinforced with a mental masterclass in his four-set win over the No 4 seed, Taylor Fritz, on Tuesday.\nOn a basic level, this semi-final pits Alcaraz\u2019s immense offensive weapons and variety against Djokovic\u2019s ability to absorb and neutralise such attacking pressure, responding with relentless depth, direction changes and spotless decision-making. But in a match-up between two of the most complete players in history, how they adapt in the heat of battle will determine the winner. Back in Australia, Djokovic\u2019s physical struggles left him with no choice but to attack at all costs. As he served supremely well and smothered Alcaraz with his forehand aggression, the Spaniard just did not know how to respond.\nThere will be moments when Djokovic tests Alcaraz\u2019s patience and shot tolerance but, considering the uncertainty around his physicality and the No 2 seed\u2019s efficient run through the draw, a similarly offensive-minded performance is surely the 24-time major champion\u2019s best chance of winning. Alcaraz, of course, can dominate anyone in the world from the baseline but he will have to return better than in Australia, rein in his impulsive instincts and fare better in the advantage-court backhand battle, which Djokovic dominated in his recent wins over the Spaniard. One positive outcome for Alcaraz is that, unlike in Melbourne, they will compete in the daytime here, the livelier day conditions augmenting his unparalleled ball pace and spin.\nThings, of course, will unlikely be any easier in the final for the victor. Jannik Sinner, the world No 1 and defending champion, will take on Felix Auger-Aliassime in the second semi-final on Friday night. The Canadian has performed admirably this week, but Sinner will be heavily favoured to win.\nFrom Djokovic\u2019s perspective, one of the most interesting things about this period of his career is how everything has come full circle. Having spent his earlier years as the third man, tasked with taking down the duopoly of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he now occupies the same position against two players born almost two decades after him. Although the odds are stacked against him \u2013 as they were 17 years ago \u2013 the simple goal is to frustrate Alcaraz and Sinner for as long as he can."

      "text": "Giorgio Armani dressed all of us. Whether or not you ever had the money for a jacket with an Armani label, you wore a jacket that he invented. He was the mastermind of contemporary style, the architect of how we dress now. If you have worn an unstructured suit with a T-shirt to a wedding; if you have worn muted neutrals to work; if you have thought it might be chic to paint your living room grey: that was Armani.\nArmani was working until his final days. Invitations had already been sent out for his next show, to be held on 28 September in the 14th-century courtyard of Milan\u2019s Palazzo Brera. A spectacular party to accompany the show was planned as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the brand, which he founded in the summer of 1975.\nOn my phone I have dozens of videos of Armani taking catwalk bows at the end of his Milan ready-to-wear and Paris haute couture shows. For the past decade, everyone in the audience at each of his shows has been aware of being in the presence of a living legend. Each brief catwalk appearance has felt like a moment to capture, because even legends don\u2019t live for ever.\nThose videos tell the story of a dignified, determined man, who even a decade ago, at 80, was taking bows in fitted navy T-shirts that showed off an impressive physique. In his last few years the walk became slower, the wave less muscular, but he was still immaculate.\nAt his January haute couture show in Paris, he wore a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo, smiling as he walked on the arm of a favourite model, blue eyes still piercing. In June and July this year, he was absent from his menswear and haute couture shows for the first time but oversaw fittings via video link from home, and corresponded with reporters over email.\nNewspaper house style requires that we refer to him as Armani, but he was always Mr Armani, not just to the industry at large but to close colleagues. The fashion industry has long been a first-name-term world, even at the highest levels \u2013 backstage, Donatella is Donatella, and Karl was Karl \u2013 but the most commercially successful European fashion designer of the past century was never Giorgio, or even Armani, but always Signor or Mr Armani.\nHis persona was elegant, detached and a little unknowable. On the occasions when I interviewed him \u2013 at his home in Milan, at Paris haute couture fashion week, and on his yacht, Mariu \u2013 he was courteous and polite, an impeccably gracious host, but always with a note of reserve.\nThe Armani story begins with a suit. In the late 1970s, Armani took the trousersuit, filleted out all the stuffiness and tradition, and replaced it with a veneer of urbane sophistication and a spritz of louche sex appeal. In doing so, he reinvented power dressing for the late 20th century.\nMore than that, in fact: he redefined what it meant to look modern. Armani intuited how the once pin-sharp divisions between a starched world of work and a warm-slippered domestic bubble were already beginning to soften, in the 1970s and 1980s, even before the internet came along to annihilate them. His supple tailoring appealed to a generation who aspired to a different kind of success, who wanted to make it big but without losing their soul. They didn\u2019t want to get stuck in the same office until they earned their carriage clock, but rather to prowl and preen around the city.\nAs lifestyles shifted, Armani tailored a new silhouette to fit. \u201cStyle for me is a mood that can be applied to everything,\u201d he once said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought fashion is much more than just clothes: it is a way of being.\u201d An Armani suit made a new generation feel like big beasts of the urban jungle. If you aspired to be an architect or an actor or a media hustler or an agent, this suit spoke to who you wanted to be. He took the suit, which had been stuck in the 9-to-5, and gave it both street smarts and bedroom appeal.\nArmani was fond of saying that \u201cthe essence of style is a simple way of saying something complex\u201d, a quote he borrowed and altered from Jean Cocteau (\u201cstyle is a simple way of saying complicated things\u201d). What he did: he took a man\u2019s suit, and he took out the shoulder pads.\nHe removed the lining, which changed the way the fabric hung: it was less taut, with a certain carefree swagger. He lowered the buttons of the jacket, and made the trouser legs a little fuller. He perfected the silhouette during the 1970s, and when the world saw it on screen on Richard Gere in American Gigolo in 1980 it seemed to capture something about modern life. In an Armani suit, a man looked primal and hungry, but somehow sophisticated and urbane at the same time. It was a heady mix of power and sex, money and ego.\nArmani was an outspoken critic of the rampant overproduction of modern fashion, criticising other designers for making too many collections. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for my collections to stay in the shops for three weeks before they become obsolete,\u201d he wrote in an open letter in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t work like that and I find it immoral.\u201d\nFor the first two decades of the 21st century, Armani\u2019s refusal to engage with trends \u2013 he never fundamentally changed either the clothes he designed or his own style \u2013 led to him being criticised as behind the times and out of touch. It turned out he was, once again, ahead of his time.\nA shift to sustainability has meant his point of view that clothes should be both designed and constructed to last has come back into fashion. He once said: \u201cElegance is not about being noticed, it is about being remembered.\u201d He is gone but will never be forgotten."

      "text": "Adelaide entered the arena on Thursday night to flamethrowers and a saxophonist. Collingwood entered to a cacophony of boos and exited with a ticket to a preliminary final at the MCG. It was hostile territory, but the Magpies have a long history of excelling in that type of scenario. It is something they lean into and embrace. It\u2019s their natural fighting stance. You just knew that the team, its leaders, its management and its supporter base would have been totally undaunted by what confronted them.\nCollingwood won this qualifying final by 24 points with extreme pressure through the middle and with a fortification down back. They are such a diligent and competent team at patrolling the middle of the ground. Their forwards close in on defenders trying to exit. They have the special awareness and the collective buy-in to execute the plan, and it creates anxiety and forces errors. All night, the Crows were hurried and second guessing themselves.\nThe Pies won it with one of the best games Darcy Moore has played in a long time. The captain was outstanding all night, reading the ball off Adelaide boots and picking them off repeatedly. Moore had deft footwork, perfect timing, sticky hands and furious fists. A number of teams have worked his locks this year, dragging him deep and isolating him one-on-one.\nBut Adelaide couldn\u2019t get a proper handle on him. His one blemish came when he inexplicably forfeited the ball across half-back, gifting the ball to his opposite number Jordan Dawson who converted with a 45m dribbler. Moore had able support from Billy Frampton and particularly Brayden Maynard, whose second efforts and shin shuddering tackles rattled the Crows. Everything about Maynard screams imminent provocation but he never lets the Pies down in games this important.\nAnd Collingwood won it with a blistering patch in the third term, booting four goals in quick succession, three of them from left-foot snaps, and all of them coming after decisive centre clearance wins. Adelaide\u2019s cause looked lost but they have shown that they can adapt and pick themselves up from seemingly hopeless positions. Luke Pedler was thrown a lot deeper than the norm and responded with two goals, and when Riley Thilthorpe marked strongly and converted on the cusp of the last change, the home side was back in it. But Collingwood completely shut the game down in the final term, a goalless quarter that went into neutral until Jamie Elliott, a threat all night, slammed home the winner.\nCollingwood\u2019s midfielders and small forwards brought the heat too. The Pies of 2022 and 2023 were content to lose the clearances and attack from half-back. Now they fight like buggery to keep it in their forward 50. They close in, bear down, tighten the noose and test the opposition\u2019s nerve and skill. And they were the smarter and more patient team at key moments.\nThey would get the precise measure of their kicks \u2013 15.5m just to be sure, ensuring they weren\u2019t called to play on. They straddled the line of what constitutes insufficient intent. They\u2019d buy a few seconds here, a few metres there. In contrast, the Crows were a bit headless, and a bit bomby. Their frustrating night was summed up by the sub Brodie Smith, just when his team was pressing hard in the final term, blazing away and ignoring several teammates in open space while Moore marked unopposed next to the goalsquare.\nOf course, the spectre of Izak Rankine hung heavily. There are far more important issues at play here. But the Crows were in a catch 22 of Rankine\u2019s making. They had two home finals. They had Taylor Walker\u2019s 300th game. They had a city and supporter base climbing out of trees to get onboard. But Rankine\u2019s slur and suspension hung over everything. And underpinning everything was the knowledge that the better they played, the worse it was for him. Now his season is still alive, but Adelaide are going to have to play a hell of a lot better than that against GWS Giants or Hawthorn if they are going to progress.\nThe residual animosity certainly had the crowd wound up. There was very little that they didn\u2019t boo. They booed every decision that didn\u2019t go their way. They booed Dan Houston. They booed the goal umpires. They booed the people manning the Arc. They were particularly vociferous with their boos for Isaac Quaynor. You know things are morally askew when it\u2019s the person on the end of the slur who\u2019s being booed. He played very well indeed, so they had plenty of opportunities to get stuck into him.\nTo bolster their travelling army, Collingwood chartered four buses at subsidised rates. Anticipation and optimism often ensure a raucous outbound journey. But the win is crucial for the return trip. Those four buses turned around and drove all through the night and are probably lobbing at Southern Cross station as you read this. Collingwood has had four finals in Adelaide and they\u2019ve won them all \u2013 a club and a team that relishes being the hunter and the hated."

And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name.

For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services.

It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.\nBrowser web storage\nBrowser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in \"local storage\" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.\nCookies\nA cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.\nDevice\nA device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.\nGoogle Account\nYou may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.\nIP address\nEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about how we use location information.\nNon-personally identifiable information\nThis is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.\nPersonal information\nThis is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.\nPixel tag\nA pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.\nReferrer URL\nA Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.\nSensitive personal information\nThis is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.\nServer logs\nLike most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These \u201cserver logs\u201d typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.\nA typical log entry for a search for \u201ccars\u201d looks like this:\n123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=cars -\nChrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -\n740674ce2123e969\n123.45.67.89\nis the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user\u2019s ISP. Depending on the user\u2019s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.25/Mar/2003 10:15:32\nis the date and time of the query.http://www.google.com/search?q=cars\nis the requested URL, including the search query.Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7\nis the browser and operating system being used.740674ce2123a969\nis the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they\u2019ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).\nUnique identifiers\nA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.\nUnique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.\nOn other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device\u2019s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device\u2019s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.\nAdditional Context\nActivity on Google Services\nIf you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account\u2019s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.\nIn some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.\nYou can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity.\nactivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\nWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.\nThis information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.\nYou can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.\nads you\u2019ll find most useful\nFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for \u201cpizza.\u201d Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.\nadvertising and research services on their behalf\nFor example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don\u2019t reveal information about individual people.\nAndroid device with Google apps\nAndroid devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions.

Learn more about Google Play Services.\nappropriate safeguards\nFor example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can\u2019t be linked to other information about you. Learn more\nbenefits the public\nFor example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.\ncustomized search results\nFor example, when you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you\u2019re signed out. If you don\u2019t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.\nCustomizing our services\nFor example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.\ndata controller responsible for processing your information\nThis means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.\ndeliver our services\nExamples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:\n- We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video\n- We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account\n- Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share. Learn more\n- A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a \u201ccheck-in\u201d button that appears in your Gmail\n- When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.\ndetect abuse\nWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action.

And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.\nInformation about things near your device\nIf you use Google\u2019s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google\u2019s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more\nlegal process, or enforceable governmental request\nLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn\u2019t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.\nmake improvements\nFor example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it\u2019s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.\nmay link information\nGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more\nour users\nFor example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

Learn more\nPlaces you label like home and work\nYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for ads.\nYou can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account.\nprotect against abuse\nFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).\npublicly accessible sources\nFor example, we may collect information that\u2019s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google\u2019s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business\u2019s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.\nrely on cookies to function properly\nFor example, we use a cookie called \u2018lbcs\u2019 that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser.

We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.\nuse the information we collect across our services\nDepending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:\n- When you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. Learn more\n- If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. Learn more\n- The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.\n- If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn more\n- If you\u2019re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.\nViews and interactions with content and ads\nFor example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.\nVoice and audio information\nFor example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like \u201cHey Google,\u201d Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more\nyour activity on other sites and apps\nThis activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.\nLearn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps."

      "text": "One of the great lost albums in rock history is to finally see the light of day, as Bruce Springsteen announces the release of the electric version of his 1982 album Nebraska.\nThe original was famously recorded in the bedroom of his New Jersey home, unaccompanied, on a four-track tape recorder rather than a multitrack studio setup. Springsteen attempted to work the songs up into more fleshed-out versions but felt the studio versions lacked the ghostly drama of the originals, and \u2013 to some confusion in his fanbase and record label \u2013 insisted on releasing the stark four-track takes.\nDespite the move away from the full-bodied sound of hit albums Born to Run and The River, Nebraska reached No 3 in the US and UK and is seen as one of the most distinctive and influential albums in Springsteen\u2019s catalogue.\nAs recently as June, Springsteen was denying that the electric versions existed: \u201cI have no recollection of it, but I can tell you there\u2019s nothing in our vault that would amount to an electric Nebraska,\u201d he told Rolling Stone. But he later updated the journalist, saying: \u201cI checked our vault and there is an electric Nebraska record, though it does not have the full album of songs.\u201d\nThose electric versions have now been pulled from the archives and will be included on a five-disc expanded edition of Nebraska, to be released on 17 October in CD and vinyl formats. The \u201celectric Nebraska\u201d disc contains versions of Nebraska\u2019s title track plus its songs Atlantic City, Mansion on the Hill, Johnny 99, Open All Night and Reason to Believe.\nIt also features Downbound Train and Born in the USA, which both appeared in different versions on the Born in the USA album in 1984, for which Springsteen re-embraced studio recording and created the biggest hit album of his career.\nThe electric Nebraska version of Born in the USA has been released alongside the album announcement. It\u2019s a radically different take to the later version that hit the US and UK Top 10, with a more brooding vocal melody and outlaw-country backing.\nAlso in the expanded album edition is a 2025 remaster of the original album; a disc of Nebraska outtakes, featuring unreleased songs such as Gun in Every Home, Child Bride and On the Prowl; and a disc plus a Blu-ray of a live concert from Count Basie theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey.\nThe release is timed to coincide with a biopic that documents this chapter in Springsteen\u2019s life.\nEntitled Deliver Me from Nowhere and written and directed by Scott Cooper, it stars Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen alongside Jeremy Strong as manager Jon Landau, Odessa Young as semi-fictional love interest Faye Romano, Stephen Graham as Springsteen\u2019s father and Paul Walter Hauser as Mike Batlan, who oversaw the Nebraska recording sessions at Springsteen\u2019s home.\nThe film, released 24 October, explores Springsteen\u2019s burgeoning fame after the successful single Hungry Heart and his quest to write, record and release Nebraska in a way that honours the original sessions.\nSpringsteen has been digging further into his archive lately. In June, he released Tracks II: The Lost Albums, a box set of seven full-length unreleased albums of material he made between other album projects. It was the sequel to his 1998 box set Tracks.\nHe said a Tracks III box set, made up of individual tracks rather than full lost albums, is also incoming. \u201cStill a lot of music in the vault, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve finished and is ready to be released,\u201d he told Rolling Stone in June. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of when we have time to put that out, considering that I have a variety of other things that I\u2019m interested in releasing soon also \u2026 I suppose it\u2019ll come out in the next three years or so.\u201d"

      "text": "A surgeon who froze his legs so they would require amputation to satisfy a sexual obsession before making nearly \u00a3500,000 in insurance claims has been jailed.\nNeil Hopper, a 49-year-old vascular surgeon, was given 32 months after he pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud by false representation. This related to claims made to insurance companies that his legs had been amputated because of sepsis rather than self-inflicted injury.\nHe also admitted three charges of possessing extreme pornographic images relating to videos from a website called the EunuchMaker.\nDespite reassurances from NHS officials, former patients of Hopper are now seeking legal advice over the treatment they received from him for fear it was not needed.\nAt Truro crown court on Thursday, Judge James Adkin heard that Hopper was identified after investigations into Marius Gustavson, who ran the website. Gustavson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years at the Old Bailey last year for leading an extreme body modification ring. It carried out male castration, penis removal and other procedures on people as young as 16.\nHopper worked for the Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust from 2013 until he was suspended from duty in March 2023 after his initial arrest. He was suspended from the medical register that December and the court heard his wife is seeking a divorce.\nThe trust has said the criminal charges against him did not relate to his professional conduct, adding: \u201cThere has been no evidence to suggest any risk to patients.\u201d\nHowever, former patients \u2013 including some who underwent amputations \u2013 have contacted the medical negligence firm Enable Law with concerns about their treatment.\nHopper dishonestly made a false representation to Aviva and Old Mutual Health that his \u201clegs had been amputated because of illness rather than self-inflicted injury\u201d, the court heard.\nIn April 2019, he used dry ice to freeze his legs to the extent they were no longer viable and required amputation. This had long been an ambition of his and he had a sexual interest in it, the court was told.\nAfter the amputation, he made claims to the insurers that resulted in payouts of \u00a3466,653.81. He spent the money on a campervan, a hot tub, wood burner and building works.\nIn addition to jailing Hopper, the judge made a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years and set a timetable for a proceeds of crime investigation to recover some of the funds he fraudulently obtained. The court heard that Hopper would lose his home.\nThe surgeon spoke of his amputation in interviews in 2023 with the BBC and in a documentary with the Welsh language channel, S4C. The court was told he \u201cenjoyed the attention\u201d the publicity generated, and he was shortlisted in the European Space Agency\u2019s search for an astronaut with a disability.\nThe General Medical Council placed restrictions on his practice in April 2023 and he has been suspended from the medical register since December 2023.\nAfter Hopper was charged, a Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust spokesperson said: \u201cThe charges do not relate to Mr Hopper\u2019s professional conduct and there has been no evidence to suggest any risk to patients. Mr Hopper worked at the Royal Cornwall hospitals from 2013 until he was suspended from duty in March 2023, following his initial arrest.\u201d"

      "text": "The New South Wales environment watchdog sat on a report for four years linking elevated levels of lead in children\u2019s blood to current mining, and promised mining companies they would not do any \u201cfinger-pointing\u201d, new documents tabled in state parliament show.\nThe documents include internal emails released under freedom of information laws that show the scientist who produced the report into lead exposure in Broken Hill was at one point texting the Environment Protection Authority every two days asking when it would be published.\nAccording to an email from a manager summarising her briefing to the mining companies, when the agency did release the report, it told them the EPA would \u201cquietly load it onto the LeadSmart website and not tell anyone\u201d, and said they would ensure there was \u201cno fanfare or media release\u201d and that they were \u201cnot doing any finger-pointing at the mines\u201d.\nThe NSW Greens said the documents, tabled in the state parliament last week, exposed a \u201cconcerning culture\u201d within the EPA, with the party\u2019s mining spokesperson, Cate Faehrmann, expressing alarm that it had taken four years before the research was finally published in late 2023, and accusing the EPA in parliament of suppressing it.\nProf Mark Taylor delivered his report summarising all of the existing published scientific research on environmental lead risks at Broken Hill, where there has been long-term mining of the metal, to the EPA in 2019.\nEmails show lead mining companies in Broken Hill were given access to the report and its findings at least a year before it was made available to the general public.\nA NSW EPA spokesperson said the community was provided with the draft report in 2020.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nTaylor was commissioned to lead the review by the Broken Hill Environmental Lead Program, which was established under the EPA in 2015 as part of a $13m state government commitment to address the issue of lead exposures and elevated blood lead levels in children in Broken Hill.\nThe report stated the level of lead in the blood of almost half (49%) of children under five and more than three-quarters of Indigenous children (76%) in the town remained elevated, and found the available research made clear that both past and current emissions from mining operations were the \u201cleading source\u201d of environmental exposure in the western NSW town.\nWhile the report did not look at the harms related to elevated levels of lead in children\u2019s blood, the NSW government\u2019s LeadSmart website states unborn babies, infants and young children are most at risk of harmful health effects from lead, particularly on \u201cbrain development, which may cause behaviour and learning problems that can last a lifetime\u201d.\nThe documents, which were released to a Mudgee community group opposing proposals for a lead mine in their region, have revealed the email correspondence between Taylor and EPA officials beginning in March 2022 when he begins to \u201cchase up\u201d when his report would be made publicly available.\nTaylor eventually became so frustrated that he wrote in a 28 June 2022 email: \u201cEventually, I will just send it to the library \u2013 it\u2019s becoming so old it\u2019s embarrassing it\u2019s not out.\u201d\nThe EPA officials acknowledged it was a \u201creally important piece of work\u201d and apologised to Taylor for all the delays, blaming the \u201cbureaucratic tangle when the EPA restructured\u201d as the reason for the delay.\nIn August 2022, officials were planning to have the report published before further emails in September and October cited the \u201cneed to socialise the report\u201d with the mining companies and \u201cunderstand any concerns they might have\u201d before it was published.\nThe documents show Taylor was asked to make a presentation to the mining companies which he said he was \u201chappy to do\u201d but noted that \u201cto the best of my knowledge, it\u2019s been circulated previously to the miners and in all honesty, there\u2019s nothing in here that they don\u2019t already know or ought to know\u201d.\nThe documents show that a meeting with lead mining companies CBH and Perilya went ahead on 3 November and managers noted it \u201cwent well\u201d but \u201cwe [BHELP] have a ways to go to gain their trust\u201d.\nIn an email on 9 January 2023 the same manager wrote: \u201cI think we will have to push the mines and get the report out.\u201d\nA senior EPA official wrote to the new EPA chief executive in March 2023: \u201cI understand that the mining companies are also particularly sensitive about the report and would prefer that we didn\u2019t publish it \u2026 they have pretty much refused to engage, other than to say that they would prefer they weren\u2019t published.\u201d\nWhen EPA managers begin discussing a media strategy, emails show, they noted that the timing of the Cadia goldmine parliamentary inquiry was an \u201cissue\u201d.\nA manager writes in another reply: \u201cwhen we say \u2018release\u2019 we mean quietly load it onto the LeadSmart website and not tell anyone\u201d.\nOn 26 October the manager sought permission to publish the report, noting: \u201cI am now receiving texts from Mark Taylor every 2 days asking where it\u2019s up to.\u201d\nThe emails also reveal the EPA offered to brief the mines in advance of publishing the report, and told them the report would be published to the website with \u201cno proactive media,\u201d and that holding lines have been prepared in the event of any media, which \u201creference the long-standing and complex nature of the problem\u201d, and \u201cwe are not doing any finger-pointing at the mines\u201d.\nThe manager also stated \u201cwe\u2019ll give the mines a heads-up if we receive any media requests\u201d.\nFaehrmann tabled some of the emails on Friday 29 August as part of NSW budget estimates.\nFaehrmann told the chamber: \u201cWhat these emails document is a concerning culture, to be honest, potentially within the EPA, of suppressing an important report like this because it is going to offend the mines.\u201d\nThe EPA CEO, Tony Chappel, responded to Faehrmann: \u201cI understand Covid, the peer review process and some other elements all contributed to that delay. As soon as I became aware of this, when I became head of this agency, we moved expeditiously to brief the Minister and release it.\u201d\nChappel said he couldn\u2019t support Faehrmann\u2019s \u201ccharacterisation\u201d.\nFaehrmann said the suppression was important because it occurred at the same time as Bowden\u2019s lead, zinc and silver mine in Mudgee was being assessed, and also meant it was not available to the parliamentary inquiry investigating the impacts of heavy metals mining, including lead.\nIt\u2019s not the first time concerns have been raised about the EPA failing to make information public.\nGuardian Australia revealed last year the regulator had known for more than decade that producers of a type of soil fill made from construction and demolition waste were failing to comply with rules to limit the spread of contaminants such as lead and asbestos into the community.\nFaehrmann told the Guardian: \u201cInstead of taking action to protect babies and young children from toxic lead exposure, government officials have tied themselves in knots to protect a dangerous industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that the mining companies had access to this report for at least a year while it was withheld from an upper house committee investigating the impacts of heavy metals mining, including lead.\n\u201cNow that we know how long they sat on this for, the government must immediately report on its progress towards implementing everything that Mark Taylor said was needed to reduce blood lead levels.\u201d\nA NSW EPA spokesperson said the authority \u201crefutes the suggestion that the Broken Hill lead report was suppressed\u201d.\n\u201cThe community was provided with the draft report in 2020 through the Broken Hill Environmental Lead Program steering committee, which included the Broken Hill Aboriginal community and the stakeholder community group convened by Broken Hill Council,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said.\n\u201cThe draft was also shared with other government agencies and industry, which is common practice.\u201d"

      "text": "Fine-particulate air pollution can drive devastating forms of dementia by triggering the formation of toxic clumps of protein that destroy nerve cells as they spread through the brain, research suggests.\nExposure to the airborne particles causes proteins in the brain to misfold into the clumps, which are hallmarks of Lewy body dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe finding has \u201cprofound implications\u201d for preventing the neurodegenerative disorder, which affects millions worldwide, with scientists calling for a concerted effort to improve air quality by cutting emissions from industrial activity and vehicle exhausts, improving wildfire management and reducing wood burning in homes.\n\u201cUnlike age or genetics, this is something we can change,\u201d said Dr Xiaobo Mao, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US and the study\u2019s lead investigator. \u201cThe most direct implication is that clean air policies are brain health policies.\u201d\nThe researchers began by analysing hospital records of the 56.5 million US Medicare patients. They looked at those who were admitted for the first time between 2000 and 2014 with the protein damage. Armed with the patients\u2019 zip codes, the scientists estimated their long-term exposure to PM2.5 pollution, airborne particles that are smaller than 2.5 thousandths of a millimetre. These can be inhaled deep into the lungs and are found in the bloodstream, brain and other organs.\nThey found that long-term exposure to PM2.5 raised the risk of Lewy body dementia, but had less of an impact on rates of another neurodegenerative brain disease that is not driven by the toxic proteins.\nLewy bodies are made from a protein called alpha-synuclein. The protein is crucial for healthy brain functioning, but can misfold in various ways to produce different kinds of harmful Lewy bodies. These can kill nerve cells and cause devastating disease by spreading through the brain.\nTo see if air pollution could trigger Lewy bodies, the team exposed mice to PM2.5 pollution every other day for 10 months. Some were normal mice, but others were genetically modified to prevent them making alpha-synuclein. The results were striking: in normal mice, nerve cells died off, leading to brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. The genetically modified mice were largely unaffected.\nFurther work in mice showed that PM2.5 pollution drove the formation of aggressive, resilient and toxic clumps of alpha-synuclein clumps that looked very similar to Lewy bodies in humans. Although the work is in mice, the findings are considered compelling evidence.\n\u201cPutting the two together, to me, indicates that there\u2019s a pretty strong association with air pollution causing Lewy body dementia. We think it\u2019s a very important driving factor for dementia,\u201d said Ted Dawson, a senior author on the study and a professor in neurodegenerative diseases at Johns Hopkins. \u201cThere needs to be a concerted effort to keep our air clean.\u201d\nThe work, published in Science, builds on previous studies that have found PM2.5s in people\u2019s brains where damage has been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and reductions in intelligence.\n\u201cOur findings have profound implications for prevention because they identify air pollution as a modifiable risk factor for Lewy body dementia,\u201d Mao told the Guardian. \u201cBy lowering our collective exposure to air pollution, we can potentially reduce the risk of developing these devastating neurodegenerative conditions on a population-wide scale.\u201d\nLast year, researchers at University College London and the Francis Crick Institute in London launched a project called Rapid, for Role of Air Pollution in Dementia, to investigate how the air we breathe may harm the brain.\n\u201cThis is an important and compelling study that deepens our understanding of how air pollution can drive neurodegenerative disease,\u201d said Prof Charles Swanton, a co-leader of the Rapid project and deputy clinical director at the Crick.\n\u201cBy linking fine-particulate matter exposure to the biology of Lewy body dementia, it provides a mechanistic bridge between environmental exposure and disease pathology. More broadly, the work underscores the urgent need to understand and mitigate the impact of air pollution on dementia and disease risk more broadly, given its enormous and growing public health burden.\u201d"

      "text": "- Exclusive\n- National\n- China relations\nRevealed: Details of private meetings Daniel Andrews held with leading Chinese business figures\nBy Eryk Bagshaw\nDaniel Andrews pledged to promote the advantages of one of China\u2019s largest state-owned energy companies as it rapidly increased its investment in the Australian electricity grid, as part of a series of meetings between the former Victorian premier and leading Chinese business figures over the past year.\nWhile the former premier stunned state and federal MPs by posing alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping, and dictators Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin in Tiananmen Square on Wednesday, official releases from provincial governments and companies in China show Andrews was extending his business networks less than a year after he resigned in 2023.\nAndrews has made several trips to China since then, including three trips between March and October 2024, and another in July this year, two months before Wednesday\u2019s military parade.\nThe business trips have capitalised on the more than $416,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money he spent on six trips to China as premier, while spruiking Chinese solar companies, e-commerce giant Alibaba, medical technology providers, airlines and liquor companies.\nThe nature of Andrews\u2019 private business dealings has remained shrouded in secrecy through the companies he has registered in Australia: Glencairn Street, Wedgetail Partners and Forty Eight & Partners, which have no websites, contact details or public updates.\nAndrews is not registered on the federal government\u2019s foreign influence register.\nAsked about Andrews\u2019 not being listed on the register on Thursday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reminded MPs in parliament that \u201ceveryone should comply with the law, it is as simple as that\u201d.\nAndrews also began meeting with Chinese companies well before the 18-month restriction imposed on business meetings by Victoria\u2019s ministerial code of conduct. The code is only a set of guidelines, and not law, but the dealings raise questions about how quickly former ministers can use their political capital in the private sector.\nIn one meeting last year with Lyu Zexiang, chairman of China Energy Engineering International Company [CEEC], a $16 billion behemoth under the control of the Chinese government, Andrews described the company as a \u201ctrustworthy partner\u201d that would \u201cgive full play to its resources and channel advantages for development in Australia,\u201d according to a statement by CEEC.\nAndrews would \u201cestablish strategic mutual trust with CEEC, assist in strengthening communication and docking with key Australian enterprises\u201d, the company said.\nAndrews was contacted for comment.\nThe company, which exports renewable energy and green hydrogen technology to Australia, is responsible for the development of the Prospect Hill waste-to-energy project outside Geelong through its subsidiary Jiangsu Power Design Institute. CEEC has also partnered with Zen Energy, established by Australia\u2019s former ambassador to China, Ross Garnaut, to deliver energy storage for a massive battery project that will power 96,000 homes in South Australia.\nChinese investment is critical to Australia\u2019s clean energy network as the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of renewable technology. The Albanese government has attempted to allay concerns about energy security by diversifying renewable sources, but the sector remains dominated by Chinese-owned enterprises.\nMining giant Fortescue, which has put Andrews on its payroll through his company Forty Eight & Partners, is also closely linked to CEEC through its interest in green hydrogen. The companies have pledged to \u201cengage in practical co-operation\u201d by contributing to \u201cthe global green and low-carbon energy transition\u201d.\nIn July, Andrews told the Governor of Anhui, Wang Qingxian, that he would actively \u201cmake more contributions to enhancing China-Australia friendship and mutual trust\u201d in a lavish meeting in Hefei.\nAndrews\u2019 former political and multicultural adviser, Marty Mei, has accompanied the former premier to each of his meetings in China. Mei, who is now Andrews\u2019 business partner, also travelled on each of his six official trips as premier. The pair established Wedgetail Partners in January 2024 to solicit foreign investment into Victoria, two months before Andrews\u2019 first post-political trip to China.\nMei, a well-connected Chinese political player in Victoria, helped secure a $100,000 donation for the Victorian Labor Party through a Chinese business group ahead of the 2014 state election, and was later instrumental in advising on the Victorian government\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative deal.\nAndrews described Mei as an outstanding Victorian, who \u201chappens to be of Chinese origin\u201d in 2018. \u201cHe is very proud of that, I am proud of him,\u201d Andrews said.\nBut since resigning as premier, Andrews has remained silent on the pair\u2019s business dealings and political networking in China, making his only public comments to Chinese state media, before releasing a statement on Thursday defending his trip to Beijing.\n\u201cI\u2019ve said for years that a constructive relationship with China \u2013 our largest trading partner \u2013 is in Australia\u2019s national interest, and hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs depend on it. That hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d he said.\nOn Thursday, China\u2019s top state media outlet, People\u2019s Daily, also quoted Andrews saying he was \u201cdeeply honoured\u201d to attend the 80th anniversary of \u201cthe Chinese People\u2019s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression\u201d, the term used for World War II by the Chinese government.\n\u201cThis history has broader regional and even global significance,\u201d Andrews was quoted as saying. \u201cThe victory of the Chinese People\u2019s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression safeguarded world peace and justice.\u201d\nThe term is diplomatically sensitive to the Japanese government, which downplays the war crimes committed by Japanese troops in China. Andrews did not respond to questions about whether the quotes were accurate, and so this masthead has not been able to confirm them.\nIn March last year, Andrews met with Wang Sheng, the president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies at the Boao Forum.\nThe institute is tasked with developing Hainan\u2019s free trade port and safeguarding \u201cChina\u2019s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea\u201d.\nIn February, Chinese fighter jets fired flares at an Australian surveillance plane over the disputed region, one of a series of dangerous incidents since 2022, triggered by Chinese military action over the South China Sea.\nAndrews invited Wang to visit him in Melbourne, the institute said, to \u201cpromote common development and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results\u201d.\nNick Coyle, the former chief executive director of AustCham Beijing, which represents Australian companies in China, said: \u201cThe main issue is to what degree he is being used as a propaganda tool.\n\u201cWould [the propaganda] hurt with his Chinese business contacts? No. Would it move the needle much? I doubt it. The needle is already moved.\u201d\nWhile photos with Xi can prove highly lucrative in China, Coyle believes the Beijing family photo with Xi, Kim and Putin, two of the world\u2019s most brutal dictators, could backfire for Andrews.\n\u201cIf you get shunned by everybody, if he becomes persona non grata for [Australian] governments and politicians to deal with, it could blow up in his face,\u201d said Coyle.\nFormer Blackmores chief executive Christine Holgate credited a rare photo with Xi in 2014 with helping the value of Blackmores\u2019 vitamins business in China skyrocket from $1 million to $500 million by 2016. But Holgate was unknown to investors in China before the photo with Xi.\nIn contrast, business meetings with Andrews are carefully co-ordinated with the help of the International Liaison Department, a Chinese government agency whose entire role is establishing and maintaining relations with foreign political parties and former politicians.\n\u201cIt is not hard as an ex-premier to get doors open for you,\u201d said Coyle. \u201cI just think he doesn\u2019t care. His ego is big enough that he\u2019s gone, \u2018if you want to call me Chairman Dan, I might as well do it properly.\u2019 \u201d\nStart the day with a summary of the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times here.\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it\u2019s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nTerms\nService provider\nIn the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided by, and you\u2019re contracting with:\nGoogle Ireland Limited\nincorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland\n(Registration Number: 368047 / VAT Number: IE6388047V)\nGordon House, Barrow Street\nDublin 4\nIreland\nAge requirements\nIf you\u2019re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.\nIf you\u2019re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s activity on the services.\nSome Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.\nYour relationship with Google\nThese terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of \u201cGoogle,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour,\u201d we mean Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google\u2019s business works and how we earn money.\nWhat you can expect from us\nProvide a broad range of useful services\n- apps and sites (like Search and Maps)\n- platforms (like Google Shopping)\n- integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies\u2019 apps or sites)\n- devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)\nMany of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.\nOur services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.\nDevelop, improve, and update Google services\nWhile we use a broad definition of \u201cservices\u201d throughout these terms as described above, applicable law draws distinctions between \u201cdigital content\u201d, \u201cservices\u201d, and \u201cgoods\u201d in certain situations. That\u2019s why we use the more specific terms in this section and the Legal guarantee section.\nWe\u2019re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware.\nAs part of the continual evolution of our digital content, services, and goods, we make modifications such as adding or removing features and functionalities, increasing or decreasing usage limits, and offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also change our digital content or services for these other reasons:\n- to adapt to new technologies\n- to reflect increases or decreases in the number of people who use a particular service\n- to respond to key changes in the licenses and partnerships we have with others\n- to prevent abuse or harm\n- to address legal, regulatory, safety, or security issues\nIn particular, we sometimes make legally-required updates, which are modifications that keep digital content, services, or goods in conformity with the law. We make these updates to our digital content, services, and goods for safety or security reasons, and to make sure they meet the quality standards that you expect, such as those described in the Legal guarantee section. We may automatically install updates that address significant safety or security risks. For other updates, you can choose whether you want them installed.\nWe maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons.\nIf a modification negatively affects your ability to access or use our digital content or services, or if we stop offering a service all together, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice by email \u2014 including a description of the changes, when they\u2019ll take place, and your right to end your contract with us if our modifications create more than a minor negative impact \u2014 except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse or harm, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We\u2019ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.\nWhat we expect from you\nFollow these terms and service-specific additional terms\n- these terms\n- service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements\nWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services \u2013 such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.\nAlthough we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.\nRespect others\n- comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws\n- respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights\n- don\u2019t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) \u2014 for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others\nOur service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren\u2019t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\nDon\u2019t abuse our services\nMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don\u2019t respect those rules, so we\u2019re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:\nYou must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems \u2014 for example, by:- introducing malware\n- spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures\n- jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programs\n- accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:\n- phishing\n- creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews\n- misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human\n- providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us\n- providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not\n- using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone\u2019s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights\n- reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law\n- using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)\n- using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology\n- hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms\n- providing services that encourage others to violate these terms\nPermission to use your content\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you\u2019re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nLicense\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else\u2019s creative content if they\u2019ve given you their permission.\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.\nWhat\u2019s covered\nThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nWhat\u2019s not covered\n- This license doesn\u2019t affect your data protection rights \u2014 it\u2019s only about your intellectual property rights\n- This license doesn\u2019t cover these types of content:\n- publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn\u2019t require a license because it\u2019s considered common knowledge that everyone\u2019s free to use.\n- feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the Service-related communications section below.\nScope\n- worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world\n- non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others\n- royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license\nRights\nThis license allows Google to:\n- host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content \u2014 for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go\n- publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you\u2019ve made it visible to others\n- modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it\n- sublicense these rights to:\n- other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose\n- our contractors who\u2019ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below\nPurpose\nThis license is for the limited purpose of:\n- operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:\n- for spam, malware, and illegal content\n- to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together\n- to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)\n- using content you\u2019ve shared publicly to promote the services. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.\n- developing new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms\nDuration\nThis license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nIf you remove from our services any content that\u2019s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:\n- If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend\u2019s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.\n- If you make your content available through other companies\u2019 services, it\u2019s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.\nUsing Google services\nYour Google Account\nIf you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work \u2014 for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.\nYou\u2019re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.\nUsing Google services on behalf of an organization or business\n- an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms\n- your organization\u2019s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.\nService-related communications\nTo provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nIf you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.\nContent in Google services\nYour content\nSome of our services allow you to generate original content.

For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.\nGoogle content\nSome of our services include content that belongs to Google \u2014 for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google\u2019s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don\u2019t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.\nOther content\nFinally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations \u2014 for example, a store owner\u2019s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization\u2019s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations\u2019 content are theirs, and don\u2019t necessarily reflect Google\u2019s views.\nSoftware in Google services\nSome of our services include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.\n- worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world\n- non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others\n- royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license\n- personal, which means it doesn\u2019t extend to anyone else\n- non-assignable, which means you\u2019re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else\nSome of our services include software that\u2019s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you.

If you\u2019re a consumer, then you enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law, as well as any additional rights provided under these terms or service-specific additional terms.\nLegal guarantee\nIf you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, and you\u2019ve agreed to our Terms of Service, then EEA consumer laws provide you with a legal guarantee covering the digital content, services, or goods that we provide you. Under this guarantee, we\u2019re liable for any lack of conformity that you discover:\n- within two years of the delivery of goods (such as a phone) or the one-time supply of digital content or services (such as purchasing a movie)\n- at any time during the \u201ccontinuous\u201d supply of digital content or services (such as Maps or Gmail)\nYour national laws may provide an even longer guarantee. Your rights under these legal guarantees aren\u2019t limited by any other commercial guarantees that we provide. If you want to make a guarantee claim, please contact us.\nLiabilities\nFor all users\n- fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation\n- death or personal injury caused by negligence\n- gross negligence\n- willful misconduct\nOther than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms, subject to applicable law.\nFor business users and organizations only\nIf you\u2019re a business user or organization:\n- To the extent allowed by applicable law, you\u2019ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.\n- If you\u2019re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don\u2019t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don\u2019t override those immunities.\n- Google won\u2019t be responsible for the following liabilities:\n- loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings\n- indirect or consequential loss\n- punitive damages\n- Except as stated in the For all users section above, Google\u2019s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) \u20ac500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.\nTaking action in case of problems\nBefore taking action as described below, we\u2019ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\n- cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google\n- violate the law or a legal enforcement authority\u2019s order\n- compromise an investigation\n- compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services\nRemoving your content\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\nWithout limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\n- you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies\n- we\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order\n- we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google \u2014 for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn\u2019t belong to you\nFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\nOf course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, you can also withdraw from these terms within 14 days of accepting them. If you do stop using a service, we\u2019d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\nHandling requests for your data\nRespect for the privacy and security of your data underpins our approach to responding to data disclosure requests. When we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google\u2019s data disclosure policies. Google Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland. For more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our Transparency Report and Privacy Policy.\nSettling disputes, governing law, and courts\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\nIf you\u2019re a resident of, or an organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, these terms and your relationship with Google under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts. If you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, please contact us to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an Online Dispute Resolution platform, but Google isn\u2019t legally required to use this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we\u2019ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\nIf you don\u2019t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2014 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.

You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.\nEEA instructions on withdrawal\nIf you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, then EEA consumer law gives you the right to withdraw from this contract as described in the EU\u2019s Model Instructions on Withdrawal, provided below.\nRight of withdrawal\nYou have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.\nThe withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.\nTo exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail). You can contact us by email at account-withdrawal@google.com; by phone\nTo meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.\nEffects of withdrawal\nIf you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract.

      "text": "As Folk Bitch Trio tell it, the music industry is a sadly predictable place.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what everyone says it is, and exactly what everybody warns you about when you\u2019re 18 and want to start working in music,\u201d says vocalist and guitarist Jeanie Pilkington. \u201cNo one makes much money. The artist often ends up getting the shitty end of the stick. You have to work really, really, really hard, and sometimes it feels impossible.\u201d\n\u201cThe way that minorities are treated in the music industry? Not surprising,\u201d adds bandmate Heide Peverelle. \u201cThe way that women are treated in the music industry? Not surprising. The way that a lot of men are in the music industry? Not surprising, and often very disappointing.\u201d\n\u201cBut there is fame and glory at the other end!\u201d laughs Gracie Sinclair.\nFolk Bitch Trio have had a crash course in the good and bad of the music industry over the past few years. The trio met at high school in Melbourne and started making music in year 12, which is when they coined their undeniable band name (one that confuses the festival bookers expecting a more typical folksy act than the breezy, indie-pop-meets-alt-rock band they actually are).\nThings moved fast: after a few early singles and \u201ca lot of hustle\u201d, this year Folk Bitch Trio announced their signing to US label Jagjaguwar, home of acts such as Bon Iver, Sharon Van Etten and Angel Olsen, and released their debut album, Now Would Be A Good Time. They modestly describe feeling \u201cbusy\u201d right now; an observer might say they seem to be on the precipice of Big Things.\nWhen we speak via Zoom, the band, now all aged 23, are sitting in a hotel room next to a highway somewhere outside Utrecht, the Netherlands, on week seven of an eight-week tour that has taken them through North America, Europe and the UK, an experience that has been both exhilarating and exhausting. As well as the jam-packed tour schedule, they launched Now Would Be A Good Time from the road, jamming press in around shows and feeling buoyed by the positive reception they were met with.\nIt\u2019s an easy album to like. Now Would Be A Good Time is a tender, lovely listen, sonically somewhere between Boygenius and Laura Marling, and anchored by the group\u2019s three-part vocal harmonies (all three sing; Pilkington and Peverelle do most of the guitar work). The album is, as they describe it, \u201cabout the turmoils of being in your 20s, and the pathetic little tragedies that you have\u201d, such as the embarrassment of getting dumped and wanting more from a situation than you can get and \u201cbeing really dramatic about it\u201d. It\u2019s fertile ground to mine.\n\u201cBeing pathetic and lonely is a great space for songwriting, I think,\u201d deadpans Pilkington.\nBut in Folk Bitch Trio\u2019s hands, the woes of youth are handled with light humour. There are songs about having a sex dream soundtracked by the TV infomercial you fell asleep watching, and lyrics that sarcastically reference inescapable self-help books (\u201cCan\u2019t deny it my body keeps the score/ But if you tell me that you need it/ I can get up off my floor\u201d).\n\u201cA lot of the songs are quite earnest, but we\u2019re also poking fun at the situations that we\u2019re writing about,\u201d says Peverelle. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not super deep, even though you feel like it is when you\u2019re 20 and going through your first breakup. You will rebuild!\u201d\nWhile many Australian artists start looking abroad after building a profile at home, Folk Bitch Trio had their sights set on going global from the jump. As soon as their album was recorded they flew to Austin\u2019s South by Southwest, where they met with every label they could before inking their Jagjaguwar deal. The music industry is, of course, far bigger in markets like North America and Europe than it is in Australia, which is a practical reason to hop a time zone or two. But the trio have never really felt as if they fit in the traditional avenues for breaking Australian bands.\nRadio station Triple J, historically one of Australia\u2019s most powerful tastemakers, has only very recently begun playing Folk Bitch Trio\u2019s music, at the very end of their album cycle (\u201cThey took their sweet time,\u201d laughs Pilkington). In an age where there\u2019s a lot of pressure on artists to go viral, the trio aren\u2019t much for meme-y Instagram or TikTok content. And while they\u2019re thrilled to be on the bill at this year\u2019s Meredith music festival in December (a \u201cbucket list\u201d booking), Australia\u2019s festival circuit \u2013 or, after a tough few years for the local music industry, what\u2019s left of it \u2013 doesn\u2019t feel quite right for them.\n\u201cA lot of those Triple J festivals, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever really felt like what we\u2019ve had our eyes on,\u201d says Pilkington. \u201cIt\u2019s not super accessible for us. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite making the right music for it. I think that our goals of [finding a] wide audience have existed outside of Australia.\u201d\nBut while their aspirations are global, Folk Bitch Trio say they\u2019re fighting to keep Melbourne their base for as long as possible. For one, the music scene in their home town is \u201cjust so pumping all the time that you can go to an awesome gig every night \u2013 it\u2019s what you want to be around,\u201d says Peverelle.\nAnd while playing to a heaving crowd at a festival in Wales is cool, their most rewarding career moments have been at home \u2013 including hearing one of their mums listen to their record on vinyl for the first time from the other room. Those are, Peverelle says, \u201cthe special moments that surprise you and rock you a little bit\u201d, and make the eyeroll-inducing stuff of bad music men and crappy money all worthwhile. The longer they spend away from home, the greater the pull becomes.\n\u201cI think we all have surprised ourselves in how much our love for Melbourne has grown through being away from it,\u201d says Pilkington from that grim, highway-side hotel room, on their first night off in almost a week. \u201cBecause you really can\u2019t fight your home. And when you exhaust yourself travelling the world, it\u2019s what you crave.\u201d\n-\nNow Would Be a Good Time is out now (Jagjaguwar). Folk Bitch Trio are touring Australia and New Zealand 5 to 28 September"

      "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/05/robodebt-class-action-settlement-biggest-in-australian-history-but-trauma-isnt-over",
      "text": "The federal government has agreed to pay $475m in compensation to the thousands of victims of the robodebt scandal.\nBoth the government and Gordon Legal, who brought the class action, have pointed out that this is the largest class action settlement in Australian history. The settlement is still subject to approval by the federal court.\nWhile this may be the largest class action settlement in Australian history, there are roughly 450,000 people estimated to be affected so this will only produce an average payment of just over $1,000 per person. However, Gordon Legal said class action members will have the option of individualised assessments which implies that some will receive more than $1,000 \u2013 and some less.\nGordon Legal sets out the most recent stages of this ongoing story, starting from their earlier class action in November 2019.\nThe story began much earlier, however, and can be dated to the aftermath of the failed 2014-15 budget which had attempted to cut social security benefits for the unemployed, among other measures severely hurting households receiving social security payments.\nSubsequent work within government led to a 2015-16 budget measure called \u201cStrengthening the Integrity of Welfare Payments\u201d. It was expected to save $1.7bn, of which about $1.2bn was to come from the welfare compliance program later called robodebt.\nThe way robodebt worked was through an automated comparison of historic fortnightly social security income records against annual tax office data for the same period. This was found to be unlawful because an individuals\u2019 entitlement to payment is based on the income they received in the same fortnight, not an average fortnightly income over a longer period. Robodebt also assumed that people had received stable incomes each fortnight.\nIt was also found to be unlawful because it reversed the onus of proof; previously cross-checking of income was manually carried out by Centrelink staff. Now, former claimants had to provide records of wages or bank transactions to prove they didn\u2019t have a debt. This allowed a massive scaling-up of debt recovery. Prior to the introduction of robodebt, Centrelink manually investigated about 20,000 income data-match discrepancies per year. Robodebt generated nearly 20,000 letters per week and DHS expected to undertake about 783,000 assessments in the 2016-2017 year.\nBetween 2017 and 2020 the scheme was investigated by the commonwealth ombudsman, the Australian National Audit Office and the parliament (twice). Despite the public and political attention, what was actually happening was deliberately obscured until 2019.\nThere were two federal court cases which finally found the program to be illegal in 2020, and the government settled the first class action lawsuit for $1.2bn later that year. That class action was approved by Justice Murphy of the federal court in June 2021, who in his judgment stated that \u201cthe proceeding has exposed a shameful chapter in the administration of the commonwealth social security system and a massive failure of public administration\u201d.\nIn 2022, a royal commission was established to investigate how the scheme came to exist. The final report of the royal commission in 2023 was even more scathing:\nIt is remarkable how little interest there seems to have been in ensuring the Scheme\u2019s legality, how rushed its implementation was, how little thought was given to how it would affect welfare recipients and the lengths to which public servants were prepared to go to oblige ministers on a quest for savings. Truly dismaying was the revelation of dishonesty and collusion to prevent the Scheme\u2019s lack of legal foundation coming to light.\nIn particular, the royal commission report contained the statement that \u201con the evidence before the commission, elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office appear to exist\u201d.\nThe second class action was brought just under one year ago to make new claims of misfeasance in public office against the officials who allegedly knew that robodebt was unlawful but went ahead with it anyway.\nRobodebt has been an ongoing failure, with the least important aspect of it being that it was budgeted to produce savings of close to $5bn between 2014 and 2021 but has now actually cost the commonwealth over $2.4bn.\nMuch more important is the impact it has had on many of the victims of the unlawful scheme, with trauma for very many, including some deaths by suicide. As journalist Rick Morton has noted, the scheme amounted to \u201cthe social engineering of shame\u201d.\nThe preface to the royal commission report emphasises that an important element of this shameful and traumatic episode has been the stigmatising of people receiving income support:\nPoliticians need to lead a change in social attitudes to people receiving welfare payments. The evidence before the Commission was that fraud in the welfare system was minuscule, but that is not the impression one would get from what ministers responsible for social security payments have said over the years. Anti-welfare rhetoric is easy populism, useful for campaign purposes. It is not recent, nor is it confined to one side of politics, as some of the quoted material in this report demonstrates. It may be that the evidence in this Royal Commission has gone some way to changing public perceptions. But largely, those attitudes are set by politicians, who need to abandon for good (in every sense) the narrative of taxpayer versus welfare recipient.\nThe trauma isn\u2019t over. The federal court took around seven months to approve the first settlement, with payments being made three months later.\nAs Acoss has pointed out, despite more than a decade passing since robodebt was first devised, the National Anti-Corruption Commission is still considering investigating six individuals referred to it by the royal commission, reversing an earlier decision not to investigate."

      "text": "One of Australia\u2019s longest running literary journals has been scrapped, in what has been described as an act of \u201cutter cultural vandalism\u201d on the part of the University of Melbourne.\nAfter 85 years, Meanjin, run by the university\u2019s subsidiary Melbourne University Publishing (MUP), will publish its last edition in December. Although the journal\u2019s editor, Esther Anatolitis, worked her last day at Meanjin on Thursday, the spring and summer quarterly editions of the journal are already at the printers.\nIn a statement, the MUP chair, Prof Warren Bebbington, confirmed Meanjin\u2019s demise, saying it was \u201ca matter of deep regret\u201d.\n\u201cThe decision was made on purely financial grounds, the board having found it no longer viable to produce the magazine ongoing,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cThe two part-time staff of Meanjin were not involved in the decision, which led to their being made redundant this week.\u201d\nBebbington told Guardian Australia that MUP and Anatolitis, who was contacted by the Guardian but declined to comment, had agreed to the wording of the statement, and he declined to confirm that the editor had signed a non-disclosure agreement as part of her redundancy package.\nBebbington also scotched speculation that any pressure was brought to bear on MUP by the University of Melbourne Council, led by the current chair of the Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, after Meanjin ran an essay highly critical of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and its unequivocal support for Israel\u2019s incursion into Gaza in its last spring edition. The article was written by the Melbourne academic Max Kaiser, a co-founder of the Jewish Council of Australia, set up in opposition to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry over the Gaza conflict.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all completely wrong,\u201d Bebbington said.\n\u201cMUP is independent, it makes its own decisions about its publications, and I doubt that the university\u2019s council has even discussed Meanjin this year. There has certainly been no discussion, no communication, with them.\u201d\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nThe former Labor politician, polymath and one of the National Trust\u2019s Australian Living Treasures, Barry Jones, a regular contributor to Meanjin, has accused the University of Melbourne of muzzling the publication\u2019s editor.\n\u201c[Anatolitis] has been exemplary as an editor \u2026 and I think she\u2019s been put in an absolutely atrocious situation,\u201d Jones told the Guardian. \u201cWorst of all is the cone of silence that\u2019s been imposed on her, and that\u2019s awful. Universities ought to be promoting diversity, not shutting down debate. This is a very disturbing pattern. I\u2019d like to think it could be reversed, but knowing the way universities operate these days, I doubt it will be. It\u2019s an act of utter cultural vandalism on a large scale.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the University of Melbourne said its council was not involved in the decision to close Meanjin, nor were any individual members of the university council involved in the decision.\n\u201cThe council was only informed after MUP had made its decision to close Meanjin,\u201d the statement said.\nThe Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance said the MUP board\u2019s claim that Meanjin is closing because it has become financially unviable \u201cdoesn\u2019t add up\u201d.\n\u201cThe publication recently secured a $100,000 grant from Creative Australia to fund its next two years of operation,\u201d the MEAA media director, Cassie Derrick, said in a statement provided to the Guardian.\n\u201cAt a time when writers and creatives are increasingly facing censorial voices, the frank and fearless writing Meanjin has always published is more important than ever.\u201d\nThe former MUP chief executive Louise Adler, director of Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week, who along with five MUP board members resigned in protest in 2019, also expressed scepticism over the publisher\u2019s claims the journal had become financially unsustainable.\n\u201cThe costs of running Meanjin were insignificant in the university\u2019s budget,\u201d she told the Guardian.\n\u201cIt is very easy to cut cultural projects \u2013 low sales, declining subscriptions, a lack of funding all provide the rationale philistines are looking for. But with every cultural institution that disappears, the opportunities for writers decline and the literary fabric of our nation is diminished.\u201d\nMeanjin, which came under the governance of MUP in 2008, has been revered as a scholarly peer-reviewed journal since its establishment in Brisbane by the journalist Clem Christesen in 1940. In 1945 the publication relocated to Melbourne and Christesen continued to serve as its editor for almost three decades.\nIt is credited for publishing myriad essays and works of fiction and poetry by emerging writers over the decades, as well as attracting the cream of Australian literary talent. Among its contributors were Patrick White, Randolph Stow, Frank Moorhouse and Thomas Keneally, who told the Guardian on Thursday that Meanjin had been with him all his life and its editor was a cultural asset.\n\u201cIt is a matter for lament that a journal of such repute and consistent commentary cannot be permitted to have an assured place amongst us,\u201d he said.\nIn the field of poetry, Meanjin\u2019s lengthy list of contributors include Judith Wright, AD Hope, Les Murray and Sarah Holland-Batt.\nHolland-Batt told the Guardian the closure of Meanjin would come as an \u201cenormous loss\u201d to Australian literature.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite devastating, really. I\u2019m shocked,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become such a mainstay of Australian literature, and it\u2019s a place where so many Australian writers and poets have had their first publications. Meanjin was always the lodestar young people were hoping to publish in.\n\u201cAll efforts should be made to save it because of the prestige it brings to MUP and to Melbourne University. It\u2019s a real pearl of Australian literature and it\u2019s just an incalculable loss.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 4 September 2025. The MEAA initially said Meanjin had received a $2m grant from Creative Australia. The MEAA then provided an updated statement with the correct amount, $100,000."

      "text": "The Albanese government would need up to $530bn worth of capital investment and a potential curbing of coal and gas exports to achieve a 2035 emissions target of 70% or more, according to new modelling commissioned by the Business Council of Australia.\nThe Climate Change Authority \u2013 the commonwealth\u2019s advisory body on emissions targets \u2013 is due to hand the government its recommendation on a 2035 target within days.\nThe business lobby group has chosen not to advocate for a specific target, as the new Andrew Forrest-backed coalition of 500 companies has done with its call for a 75% cut, instead commissioning consultancy firm McKinsey to model the scale of capital investment required to achieve three emissions reduction pathways out to 2035: a cut of roughly 50%, roughly 60% and 70% plus.\nSignificantly, the modelling does not factor in the cost of not acting on the climate crisis, nor does it measure the economic benefits of new investment.\nThe Climate Change Authority\u2019s preliminary advice suggested a range between 65% and 75% would be ambitious but achievable, setting the expectations for what would ultimately be recommended to the government.\nPolitical and industry insiders expect the Matt Kean-chaired authority to similarly propose a target range in its final advice. Cabinet is expected to sign off on a 2035 before Anthony Albanese attends the UN general assembly leaders\u2019 summit in New York later this month.\nThe Business Council\u2019s report, to be released on Friday, found that if the government implemented its existing policies and hit its 43% goal by the end of the decade then it could reach roughly 50% by 2035.\nThe first scenario would require between $210bn and $300bn in total investment across the public and private sector.\nSubstantially greater sums of spending, significant policy changes and a much larger green industry workforce would be needed in the two higher scenarios, which more closely align with what the Climate Change Authority is tipped to recommend.\nAccording to the modelling, achieving about 60% would require between $395bn and $480bn worth of capital investment while up to $530bn would be needed to exceed 70%.\nThe most ambitious scenario assumes the electricity sector would run on 90% renewables by 2035 on the back of record rates of construction of new wind, transmission and gas capacity.\nThe scenario accounts for a possible reduction in thermal coal and LNG exports, causing a loss in the value of Australia\u2019s exports of between $100bn and $150bn each year.\nThe Business Council of Australia chief executive, Bran Black, said the modelling was designed to provide \u201cclarity\u201d on what would be required to achieve a 2035 target.\n\u201cAmbitious but achievable targets with the right policies to deliver them are key to Australia\u2019s long-term competitiveness and prosperity,\u201d Black said.\nBlack singled out the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as a major \u201chandbrake\u201d on the energy transition, reiterating calls for urgent changes to speed-up project approvals.\nThe Business Council, whose members include BHP, Santos and Rio, has long been an influential voice in the climate debate and its position on the 2035 target has been highly anticipated among industry and environmentalists.\nThe group\u2019s position on climate targets has shifted over the past decade.\nAfter attacking as \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d the 45% 2030 emissions target that Bill Shorten took to the 2019 election, it threw its support behind a cut of up to 50% before the Glasgow climate summit in 2021."

We do not drop first or third party cookies, or otherwise access local storage through our affiliate links. Instead we use a type of link that redirects users into Skimlinks\u2019 network.

The IP address and user agent are anonymised and truncated by Skimlinks.

When a reader clicks on a link, Skimlinks will identify which page the click came from and assign it a randomly generated number. This is communicated to the retailer and associated with any subsequent purchase. The affiliate marketing partner, such as Skimlinks, then reconciles the list of clicks from links on the Guardian with purchases on the retailer\u2019s site. This is used in order to calculate the commission for the Guardian.\nAgencies and authorities if required by law - We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in response to a valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or warrant).

We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.\nCalifornia resident - Do not sell\nThese transfers to third parties may constitute \u201csale\u201d of your personal information under California law. A California resident can halt these sales at any time by pressing the \u201cCalifornia resident - Do not sell\u201d link that is located in the footer of every page on our site.

While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.\nWhenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:\n-\nWe will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.\n-\nWe may also use specific approved contracts that use Standard Contractual Clauses for the protection of personal data where appropriate, with our service providers that are based in countries outside the UK or the EEA, including those based in the US and Australia. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the UK or the EEA.\nIf you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the UK or the EEA.\nHow long we keep your personal data\nWe keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep your personal data while you are still using our product or service. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription.\nIf we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data.

      "text": "European leaders have made fresh efforts to pin down Donald Trump on the level of support he is willing to give Ukraine to push back a Russian advance, and asked him to detail the security guarantees he would provide to any European peacekeeping force inside Ukraine in the event of a lasting ceasefire.\nEuropean leaders spoke with Trump by video call on Thursday after first holding a meeting of the so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d in Paris, co-chaired by Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer.\nThe precise commitments made by European states to the coalition of the willing are largely complete but in part depend on the extent to which the US will specify the aid it is willing to give in terms of intelligence, air support and funding.\nMany European countries including Germany, Spain and Italy have refused so far to provide troop commitments. A German spokesperson said: \u201cThe focus should be on financing, arming and training the Ukrainian armed forces,\u201d a formula that is not vastly different from what Europe is now providing.\nAlarmed European leaders travelled to the White House in the wake of the August Alaska summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin fearing that the US president may be about to force Volodymyr Zelenskyy into a humiliating surrender, including loss of territory.\nTrump responded to the European lobbying by claiming he had won the Russian leader\u2019s agreement to hold direct talks with the Ukrainian president, but Russia rejected any such commitment and largely maintained its demand for the surrender of Ukrainian territory and a commitment that Ukraine will never join Nato.\nTrump had set a deadline of 1 September for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but Trump is known to set deadlines that he then ignores. \u201cWe had a great relationship,\u201d Trump said of Putin in an interview with the rightwing news website The Daily Caller. He said he was now very disappointed in the Russian president: \u201cThousands of people are dying; it\u2019s a senseless war.\u201d\nEurope has been desperate to ensure Trump does not wash his hands of the war, but it has been unable to convert Trump\u2019s stated frustration with Putin into a plan to try to strangle the Russian economy.\nMacron in Paris sought to give the impression that Europe, unlike Russia, stuck to its commitments. He said: \u201cThe contributions that were prepared, documented and confirmed at the level of defence ministers under the strictest secrecy allow us to say: this work is complete and will now be politically approved.\u201d\nEurope has been hoping for months that Trump would activate long-promised sweeping economic sanctions on countries that import Russian oil. The 50% tariffs that the US imposed on India, partly for importing Russian oil, appear to have driven the traditionally non-aligned Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, closer into the arms of China and Russia.\nStung by his diplomatic failure so far, Trump has given the impression of wanting to focus on domestic policy, including crime and the economy.\nThe US was represented at the Paris talks by Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who also met Zelenskyy separately.\nAfter the summit, Starmer\u2019s office said it was necessary \u201cto go even further to apply pressure on Putin to secure a cessation of hostilities.\u201d\n\u201cThe prime minister said Putin could not be trusted as he continued to delay peace talks and simultaneously carry out egregious attacks on Ukraine,\u201d No 10 added.\nRussia has said it will not tolerate European troops in postwar Ukraine.\nThe coalition of the willing includes about 30 nations backing Ukraine, mainly European but also Canada, Australia and Japan. It has met repeatedly at military and political level but not published any detailed plan of action, reflecting internal divisions and uncertainty about the nature of the US contribution.\nIn a breakthrough of sorts, the plan for Europeans to buy US arms for use in Ukraine has started to bear fruit. On 28 August, the US state department announced the delivery of 3,350 ERAM long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, worth $825m (\u00a3615m, \u20ac705m).\nThe funding came from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and the US, but the financial contribution of each country was not disclosed. The ERAM missiles have a range similar to that of the Franco-British Scalp-EG missiles, which Ukraine fired at occupied Crimea and the Russian region of Kursk.\nZelenskyy said he had not seen \u201cany signs from Russia that they want to end the war\u201d.\nThe Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said it was not for Putin to decide if European troops would be stationed inside Ukraine. He said: \u201cI think we really have to stop making Putin too powerful.\u201d\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, described Putin as the most severe war criminal of our time.\nOn Wednesday in Beijing, Putin attended a military parade alongside Xi Jinping and hailed Russian forces\u2019 progress in Ukraine, saying troops were advancing on \u201call fronts\u201d.\nBut there are signs that sanctions are finally taking a toll on the Russian economy after two years of high growth fuelled by defence spending. The Sberbank chief, German Gref, one of Russia\u2019s most powerful bankers, warned on Thursday that the economy was stagnating and that unless the central bank cut interest rates then the country would fall into recession.\nRussia\u2019s war economy grew at 4.1% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024 but it is slowing sharply under the weight of high interest rates required to dampen inflation."

      "text": "Sam Kerr is poised to make her long-awaited return for Chelsea on Friday night after 20 months out because of a serious knee injury, when the Women\u2019s Super League season gets under way.\nThe Chelsea head coach, Sonia Bompastor, said on Thursday that the Australia striker would be in her squad when the defending champions host Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.\nKerr has not played for Chelsea competitively since rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in January 2024 and missed the whole of last season as her club won a domestic treble.\n\u201cSam Kerr is in the squad, so she will be involved in the game,\u201d Bompastor said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if she will start or not, but yes, she is in the squad, she\u2019s in a good place. She\u2019s been training well. She\u2019s mentally and physically in a good position.\n\u201cShe is one of the players who everyone wants to see on the pitch and it\u2019s nice for me to have her in the squad with her leadership and experience. At the same time, she\u2019s been away from the pitch for a long time so I think we need to still be patient with her and it\u2019s normal for her to not be at the best level yet. Sam is a great player.\u201d\nKerr\u2019s return could be timely after Mayra Ram\u00edrez had surgery on a hamstring injury that will sideline her for a lengthy spell. Bompastor said: \u201cShe had successful surgery, which is something really positive, but it\u2019s sad for Mayra and sad for us because she was a really important player in the team. For me now it\u2019s about making sure she had a speedy recovery. That\u2019s a big loss for us.\u201d\nChelsea are also without the England right-back Lucy Bronze, who played through a fractured tibia during Euro 2025. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult now to put a timeframe on Lucy\u2019s return but she is doing well,\u201d Bompastor said. \u201cShe\u2019s in a good place mentally and physically, so hopefully she will come back soon, but I think she\u2019ll still be some weeks away from her return on the pitch.\u201d"

      "text": "A week before the March for Australia rallies, leaders from the south Asian community held an emergency meeting.\n\u201cI feel this will be Cronulla 2.0,\u201d Amar Singh texted the group on 23 August, to arrange the meeting for the following day.\n\u201cThere have already been physical attacks on international students in Sydney,\u201d the former Australian of the Year local hero award-winner warned.\nMigrants of Indian background were directly targeted in promotional material available on the March for Australia website before the anti-immigration protests that took place across Australia on Sunday, echoing similar racist messaging in the UK, and members of Australia\u2019s Indian diaspora community continue to report troubling stories about an increase in prejudice towards those of south Asian heritage.\nThere was violence on the streets of Melbourne\u2019s CBD during the March for Australia, and it was followed by an alleged attack on women at a First Nations protest site by a group of men including some members of neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Network. The group\u2019s leader, Thomas Sewell, has been charged with multiple offences, including violent disorder and affray over the alleged incident at Camp Sovereignty.\nIn the wake of the marches, Singh and others remain shocked and concerned over the racist targeting of Australia\u2019s Indian diaspora community.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nOn Wednesday, the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, and police conveyed a meeting of the state\u2019s anti-hate taskforce, which heard directly from members of the Indian community about their concerns.\n\u201cWe have seen really hateful behaviour in recent days [and] its been so disappointingly targeted at the Indian community,\u201d Allan said in a video posted on social media.\n\u2018Hate rallies controlled by neo-Nazis\u2019\nWhile supporting \u201cpeople\u2019s right to protest\u201d, Singh said the March for Australia was \u201cnothing but hate rallies controlled by neo-Nazis\u201d.\n\u201cIf those neo-Nazis weren\u2019t welcome, they wouldn\u2019t have spoken at the rallies,\u201d the Turbans 4 Australia charity founder said.\n\u201cWhat do we have to do to be Australian? We celebrate Australia Day, we give back, we volunteer \u2026 it\u2019s a whole process to come into Australia, it\u2019s not just like you get a ticket one day and come in.\u201d\nAs the rallies approached, there was confusion about who the organisers were in each state, although statements on the March for Australia Facebook page distanced the events from white supremacists.\n\u201cIn particular, recent claims by Thomas Sewell of White Australia are not reflective of the organisers nor the politics of March For Australia. We are not associated with their organisation,\u201d it posted on 12 August.\nYogesh Bhatt, a Hindu interfaith leader with Merri-bek council in Melbourne\u2019s inner-north, was \u201cshocked\u201d to see the Indian community singled out in material promoting the march.\n\u201cThe Indian community is a well-educated, peace-loving and law-abiding part of the multicultural fabric of Australia,\u201d Bhatt, who is also the president and founder of the Vivekananda Society of Australia, said.\n\u201cWe have contributed significantly to this country\u2019s growth in various fields like technology, healthcare, education, business, you name it.\n\u201cWe pay our taxes. I\u2019m not sure why they targeted us.\u201d\nHe said in the lead-up to the rally, community leaders spread the message not to visit the Melbourne CBD over the weekend to prevent the situation from escalating.\nBhatt said he was later shocked to see the number of people that attended the rally \u2013 estimated by Victoria police to be 5,000 including counter-protesters \u2013 and the involvement of neo-Nazis, with far-right figure Thomas Sewell addressing the crowd from the front steps of state parliament.\n\u201cSometimes I think, is this the same Melbourne I migrated to years back?\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not.\u201d\nHe said the rally, as well as recent vandalism at several Hindu temples, including racist graffiti at the Shree Swaminarayan temple in Boronia in July, have made headlines back in India.\nThreats and attacks\nThe attacks on students that so concerned Singh and prompted the emergency meeting of community leaders reportedly occurred on the night of 20 August, when two women with Indian heritage were travelling on a train in Sydney\u2019s west.\nSingh said he was told a group of three women accosted one of the students, punching her, spitting on her, and spilling beer on her, while shouting insults at her about her race and telling her to \u201cgo back home\u201d. One of the attackers appeared to be filming.\nThe first student got off the train at Seven Hills station, and the group then turned their attention to the second student, Singh said, who was similarly attacked before getting off the train in Blacktown. Singh said the attacks were reported to New South Wales police, who have been contacted for comment.\nSingh said he himself is routinely threatened online, with people commenting on his posts that he should \u201cassimilate\u201d and warning that they were outside his house.\nHe said he \u201cwould need a full-time [personal assistant]\u201d if he were to report every online threat he received.\nMigrants were being scapegoated for issues that were not of their making, he said.\n\u201cIf you look at bus drivers, or security guards, all these other jobs, it is all people from ethnic backgrounds doing those jobs. Who is taking other people\u2019s jobs? Nobody,\u201d he said.\nTarang Chawla, a commissioner on the Victorian Multicultural Commission, said that many migrants from south Asia were in fact feeling the same cost-of-living and housing pressures that were being used as a stalking horse for their vilification.\n\u201cThe angst and turmoil that lower socioeconomic groups, regardless of race, are experiencing across the county is quite common.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a protest founded in reason or statistics, this is the lowest common denominator, racially motivated, filled with prejudice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same old tired narrative when you blame Indians for something that\u2019s not of their making.\u201d\nAt the March for Australia in Brisbane on Sunday, a man who described himself as Indian spoke to the crowd.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m a brown man, yes I\u2019m an immigrant from India, but I came here for the right reason,\u201d the man said.\n\u201cI came here by the right path \u2026 but what I see happening today, this is not immigration, this is an open door policy, anyone can come in, take a spot, and demand that Australia change for them.\u201d\nThe man was largely drowned out by boos, before a group of others chanted \u201clet him speak\u201d.\n\u2018Have we not learned anything?\u2019\nDr Surjeet Dogra Dhanji, an academic fellow at the University of Melbourne and former director for cultural diplomacy at the Australia India Institute, says racism toward migrants has existed for as long as migration itself.\n\u201cWe may have put the White Australia policy behind us but every time a new group comes to this country they go through the same cycle of racism. Have we not learned anything?\u201d she says.\nThe Indian community has been the target of vitriol prior to Sunday\u2019s rallies, with videos circulated on social media over the summer showing spectators at the Melbourne Cricket Ground chanting \u201cwhere\u2019s your visa\u201d on the final day of the fourth Test between Australia and India, and clips of Flinders Street station accompanied by the words \u201cMumbai or Melbourne?\u201d.\nDogra Dhanji says the flyers circulating about the March for Australia was the \u201cfirst time\u201d she had seen the Indian community \u201ctargeted as openly\u201d, with rhetoric mirroring that used in the US and UK.\nOne flyer decried the number of Indian migrants coming to Australia, saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t about a slight cultural change \u2013 it\u2019s replacement plain and simple\u201d \u2013 reflecting the language of a racist conspiracy theory that claims there is a plot to replace white people in western countries via immigration and birthrates.\nThe latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that Indian-born people comprise just 3.2% of Australia\u2019s population.\nDogra Dhanji says the rhetoric employed at the protest stood in contrast to most Victorians\u2019 views on the Indian diaspora, and welcomed the Victorian Liberals calling out the racist flyer on the Friday before the rally.\nEvan Mulholland, the Victorian opposition\u2019s multicultural affairs spokesperson, said \u201cattacks on Australian citizens of any heritage are completely misdirected and unacceptable\u201d.\n\u201cThe Liberals and Nationals won\u2019t stand for the blatant targeting of any community, and in this instance it was Indian-Australians who were singled out.\n\u201cIndian Australians love this country. They\u2019re patriotic, adopt the Australian way of life, value family and education, and are upstanding citizens.\u201d"

      "text": "Vulnerable elderly people could be priced out of laundry and showering help under Labor\u2019s new model for aged care, the independent watchdog has warned, two months out from a co-payment system coming into force.\nThe aged care inspector general, Natalie Siegel-Brown, has used a major report to warn of \u201cgenuine fears\u201d the model asking some elderly people to pay more for non-clinical care could see some forgo services.\nTracking implementation of recommendations from the landmark royal commission into aged care, Siegel-Brown\u2019s report warned the co-payment model for residential and at-home care \u201cis contrary to the royal commission\u2019s intent\u201d.\nThe report continued that \u201cimplementing co-payments may set up a scenario where vulnerable older Australians will forego care: either because they cannot afford it or because they are worried about the cost\u201d.\nThis week the government caved in to demands from the Senate crossbench and agreed to bring forward 20,000 in-home aged care funding places in the eight weeks before the new system starts.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nUnder the changes, elderly people in residential care will make co-payments for daily living expenses and accommodation costs but sector operators and experts have warned this could lead to a two-tier system with a disincentive for homes to accept government-supported residents due to lower revenue.\nSiegel-Brown said while the pool of government funding was not unlimited, she feared the changes could \u201cpotentially create unnecessary cost blow outs\u201d or pre-emptively push people into residential aged care when they cannot access or afford the care they need to stay at home.\n\u201cWhile my primary concern is for the human rights consequences, the fact is that this act could ultimately cost the taxpayer more.\u201d\nThe report also warned Indigenous aged care services would be streamlined, limiting the ability of providers to offer culturally responsive and flexible care.\nThe Greens\u2019 aged care spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, called the inspector general\u2019s report a wake-up call.\n\u201cThis report has warned of a two-tiered system, where aged care increasingly becomes about the care you can afford rather than the care you need,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI am scared stiff for older people under this new system.\n\u201cLabor needs to come clean about how much older people will pay under this new system and whether they will be able to access care.\u201d\nDemand for aged care is expected to surge. Australia is on track for a doubling of people over 65 and a tripling of those aged over 85 within 40 years.\nThe aged care minister, Sam Rae, said the government acknowledged \u201cthe job ahead of us\u201d.\n\u201cThere\u2019s much more to do to realise the full vision of what the inspector-general describes as a \u2018magnificent mandate\u2019 for our aged care system.\u201d\nLabor has finalised 54 of the 148 commission recommendations, with a further 94 in progress."

      "text": "Giorgio Armani, the celebrated Italian fashion designer who built a global empire, has died at the age of 91, his company said on Thursday.\n\u201cWith infinite sorrow, the Armani Group announces the passing of its creator, founder and tireless driving force: Giorgio Armani,\u201d the fashion house said in a statement.\nHis vast portfolio included the Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani clothing lines alongside the haute couture label Armani Priv\u00e9 and an Armani Casa design and interiors line.\nHe was absent from his last three shows, held in June and July, owing to illness. He had been expected to attend the brand\u2019s 50th anniversary celebrations later this month including an exhibition at the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan.\nThe founder and sole shareholder of Giorgio Armani SpA, Armani reportedly refused numerous offers throughout his career to become part of one of the big four luxury fashion conglomerates. He described the independence of his brand as \u201can essential value\u201d.\nHis inaugural 1975 presentation pioneered the idea of soft power dressing, earning him the title \u201cKing of the Blazer\u201d. His proposition of fluid rather than structured suiting featuring longer-cut suit jackets, loosely pleated trousers and floor-sweeping belted coats formed an entirely new approach to dressing. He applied the same techniques to womenswear, freeing many from the fussy and figure-hugging silhouettes prescribed by other brands. His muted colour palette of greys and beige became synonymous with stealth wealth, long before the idea of quiet luxury entered the lexicon.\nIn 1980 the brand was catapulted to international fame when Richard Gere wore numerous pieces designed by Armani in the film American Gigolo.\nThis also pioneered a new way of working with Hollywood. While in the past couturiers had a relationship with one specific star, such as Hubert de Givenchy and Audrey Hepburn, Armani had multiple.\nIn 1978, Diane Keaton became the first actor to wear Armani on the Oscars red carpet. Jodie Foster has worn the label to every ceremony but one since 1989, while Julia Roberts\u2019 1990 look of a steel grey oversized Armani suit teamed with a white shirt and tie has become one of the most memorable Golden Globes looks of all time.\nBorn in Piacenza in northern Italy in 1934, Armani originally pursued a career in medicine. He left the University of Milan before completing his degree to join the army. Shortly after he began looking for a different type of career.\n\u201cI got into fashion almost by accident and then it slowly grew in me until it completely absorbed me, stealing my life away,\u201d he previously said.\nAfter working as a window dresser and later a sales associate at La Rinascente, a notable department store in Milan, he took on a menswear design role at Nino Cerruti.\nArmani was 41 when he launched his own label. It was his partner Sergio Galeotti, an architect by training, who convinced him to sell his Volkswagen Beetle to fund his own company. Galeotti ran the books while Armani focused on the creative side. When Galeotti died in 1995, Armani continued alone.\nArmani-branded products generated \u00a33.5bn in 2021. They included a collection of hotels, restaurants, nightclubs, cosmetics, chocolates and even floristry.\nAfter his spring/summer 2022 collection, Armani for the first time took his bow alongside Leo Dell\u2019Orco, the head of the men\u2019s style office, who originally joined the company in 1977.\nA statement issued on behalf of his employees and family said: \u201cIn this company, we have always felt like part of a family. Today, with deep emotion, we feel the void left by the one who founded and nurtured this family with vision, passion, and dedication. But it is precisely in his spirit that we, the employees and the family members who have always worked alongside Mr Armani, commit to protecting what he built and to carrying his company forward in his memory with respect, responsibility, and love.\u201d\nIn an interview with the Financial Times published days before his death, Armani explained how he planned to pass on his vast estate.\n\u201cMy plans for succession consist of a gradual transition of the responsibilities that I have always handled to those closest to me \u2026 such as Leo Dell\u2019Orco, the members of my family and the entire working team.\u201d He added that he \u201cwould like the succession to be organic and not a moment of rupture\u201d.\nAs the news broke on Thursday, designers and celebrities began to pay tribute on social media. \u201cThe world lost a giant today. He made history and will be remembered forever,\u201d wrote the fashion designer Donatella Versace.\n\u201cA great honor to have had the chance to meet and work with such an amazing person,\u201d wrote the Ferrari Formula One driver Charles Leclerc, who previously starred in an Armani campaign. \u201cYou will be missed Giorgio.\u201d\n\u201cA true friend. A legend,\u201d posted Roberts.\n\u201cIncredibly saddened to hear about the passing of Giorgio Armani,\u201d wrote the actor Diane Kruger. \u201cOne of the nicest people and mentors I was lucky enough to meet and work with.\u201d\nThe former British Vogue editor Edward Enninful posted: \u201cMr Armani taught me the importance of entrepreneurship and community and believing in your own creativity. Since meeting in the 90\u2019s, he always believed in me and gave me a seat at the table from day one; from styling his campaigns to his endless words of wisdom at each stage of my career, he always made me feel seen.\u201d\nIn a series of posts on X the actor Russell Crowe recounted how losing his bags on the way to the Cannes film festival in 1997 led to him discovering the designer. \u201cI adored him. He was so kind. So many significant moments in my life, awards, wedding, Wimbledon \u2026 all in Armani. What a life he had, from his beginnings to his glory.\u201d\nWhen asked in a 2022 interview how he\u2019 would like to be remembered, Armani replied: \u201cAs a sincere man. I say what I mean.\u201d"

      "text": "In the 1970s, the fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who has died aged 91, anticipated two permanent and interdependent cultural shifts: the rise in the cult of the gym, which made every man\u2019s physique his own responsibility, rather than a tailor\u2019s; and the end of constriction in men\u2019s clothing.\nEven before he showed his first collection, in 1975, Armani had been challenging ideas about the male suit and overcoat as they had been constructed since the 1790s \u2013 on a basis of stiff canvas, interlining, padding and special stitching, so as to reshape a man\u2019s torso to look as much as possible like a classical statue. He discarded this armature that helped hide imperfections. And when he draped a fluid suede jacket on the toned body of Richard Gere in the 1980 movie American Gigolo, he finally knocked the stuffing out of tailoring. It has never quite returned.\nArmani said of the film\u2019s core, man-chooses-what-to-wear sequence: \u201cThe magical moment, where the shirts are on the bed and Gere throws the ties on the shirt, was so right for the time. It was about his choices, his muscles; it was throwing away the whole story of the way men dress.\u201d\nArmani was just as revolutionary when he offered female professionals the same boneless structure as men, at a time when a suit, trousered or skirted, was becoming an almost obligatory uniform for working women. His gentler power dressing was the easiest female working gear since Coco Chanel invented her tweed suit in 1954. He explained: \u201cI always tried to eliminate the things that made women appear like a caricature of themselves.\u201d\nArmani\u2019s success was particularly Italian, a product of the city of Milan, where he worked with textiles for years before he used his knowledge of them for design. The Italian clothing industry could weave, cut and sew high-quality products, but it had lacked international prestige, and was willing to support designers who might supply that. Armani took its cloth and leather, and tapped its skills, especially new ready-to-wear manufacturing techniques that could simulate the flexibility in movement of handwork. For the rest of his life he reinvested in Milan, where his base and heart remained, as its duke of fashion.\nHe was not to the palazzo born, although his taste for ascetic luxury was evident early; he attributed it to his mother, Maria (nee Raimondi), and her \u201csense of taking things away, of being minimal\u201d. Materially, there was not much to subtract \u2013 as the wife of Ugo Armani, who worked for a transport company, she brought up Giorgio and his siblings, Sergio and Rosanna, in wartime Piacenza, south of Milan, doing without herself in order to dress them well in hard times. Armani remembered all her few dresses, and she remained his confidante into her 90s. He was intrigued by his grandfather\u2019s wigmaking for the theatre, too, and developed his own imagination staging puppet shows and watching movies. So far, so Cinema Paradiso.\nArmani left for military service, and studied at medical school, but outgrew his ambition to be a doctor. He got a window-dresser\u2019s job in 1957 at the Milanese department store La Rinascente, then took charge of its fabrics. Ignorant of fashion, unable to draw, but simpatico with cloth, he was hired by the menswear firm Nino Cerruti to manage its textiles in 1964, then moved into design; he went freelance in 1970.\nAt Cerruti, he met Sergio Galeotti, who became his partner in love and business; together they set up a company in 1975, selling Armani\u2019s old VW Beetle to fund their tiny office. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of experience,\u201d said Armani, \u201cbut we had energy.\u201d Galeotti gave Armani confidence; he managed sales, flying to the US to dictate Armani\u2019s terms, and all finances so completely that Armani did not even need to carry a wallet.\nBy the late 70s the cool crowd were collecting Armani\u2019s pricey pieces, and he was asked to provide a sexy wardrobe for John Travolta in the lead role of American Gigolo; when the casting was amended to Gere, it proved fortunate for Armani. His clothes moving over Gere\u2019s gym-honed body filmed so well that the director Michael Mann had him design outfits for the leads of the 80s television cop show Miami Vice: Armani did the linen tailoring, the actors added socklessness and stubble. Later, he lettered \u201cArmani for Bruce Wayne\u201d inside Batman\u2019s civilian suits, and was even able to ameliorate Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s ripped muscles.\nAs showbiz red-carpet wear began to compete for attention with catwalk shows, Armani set up an LA office to deal directly with the stars\u2019 stylists, and in 2005 Armani Priv\u00e9, a label to handle year-round special couture orders not bound to collections or seasons. Yet he rejected supermodels for his own shows because he thought they obscured the clothes.\nWhat Armani described as his \u201cmad dash for glory\u201d ended when Galeotti died at 40 in 1985. The industry expected Armani to close; instead the designer learned, mostly by error, to manage his business and to carry, if not cash, then a pen to sign the bill. But his firm refused outside investment, and resisted incorporation into the luxury goods conglomerates that financed many of his competitors. He retained control from thread to shopfloor \u2013 \u201cIt is all tied together, all this needs to be in your hands for it to be successful\u201d \u2013 investing in Italian manufacture while others outsourced globally.\nAs chairman, chief shareholder and, from his 84th year, general manager, Armani did not have to publish accounts, but he enjoyed financial candour, and the value of the Giorgio Armani Group is more than \u00a38bn \u2013 in Italy, only Gucci and Prada are bigger.\nHis clothes, chocolates, coffee and cutlery are sold along a \u201cVia Armani\u201d of Milanese shops, and the city has an Armani cafe, nightclub and hotels. Despite the proliferation of Armani outlets worldwide, he remained wary of mass marketing, and balanced it with his belief in a discretion that \u201cslays vulgarity\u201d. No naffness was permitted in the hotel with his name that opened in 2011 within the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, where he designed and styled interiors.\nArmani disciplined himself with northern Italian rigour: non-smoking, teetotal, working from early-morning gym sessions to the meat-free late supper he might prepare himself. He swam daily in a water channel beneath the theatre within his town palazzo. Like all his homes, this had been minimalised: plain panels camouflaged its frescoes, except for a Tiepolo roundel too perfect to be hidden. Armani did not collect art, owning only one Matisse given to him by Eric Clapton; his first yacht, Mari\u00f9, was named after a song his mother sang, and its successor was Ma\u00edn, her childhood nickname. His philosophy was \u201cUn po\u2019 Zen\u201d (a little Zen): \u201cYou can add on to simplicity. You cannot add on to the baroque.\u201d For years, the palazzo cat was a close-clipped greige Persian.\nFor all his shyness, Armani was a public figure, mobbed whenever he was spotted in his home country. His retrospective exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2000 (which toured to the Royal Academy in London and the Bilbao Guggenheim) was staged as art rather than fashion, and he collected more than 50 awards including, in 2019, the outstanding achievement award of the British Fashion Council.\nHe is survived by his sister, Rosanna, two nieces, Silvana and Roberta, and a nephew, Andrea."

      "text": "The world during Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency has entered a period of danger with \u201ccertain similarities to the 30s\u201d, according to Mitch McConnell, the veteran Republican former Senate leader.\nMcConnell made the comments primarily in reference to tariffs and foreign affairs, in a wide-ranging interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader published on Wednesday as he prepares to enter his final year in office.\nCalling it \u201cthe most dangerous period since before world war two\u201d, McConnell was openly critical of the Trump administration\u2019s fixation with trade tariffs, which he likened to the isolationist policies of the US in the 1930s that historians say hastened a global depression that paved the path to conflict.\nBut while decrying the lack of US preparedness to confront authoritarian regimes abroad, the 83-year-old McConnell \u2013 a senator since 1985 and leader of Republicans in the chamber for a record 18 years until he stood down earlier this year, then announced his upcoming retirement \u2013 did not discuss the Trump administration\u2019s own moves towards authoritarianism.\nHe also glossed over his own responsibility for handing Trump so much power. As majority leader, McConnell maneuvered to deny Barack Obama a rightful supreme court pick, and rushed to give Trump another in the final weeks of his first term in 2020. It made McConnell the architect of the current ultraconservative 6-3 majority on a panel that critics say has been overly loyal to Trump, not least last year\u2019s astonishing ruling giving him immunity for criminal acts.\nIn the interview, McConnell said he had been focusing on \u201cdefense and foreign policy\u201d in the months since returning to the Senate\u2019s back benches, and had become worried about the direction he believed Trump\u2019s \u201cmake America great again\u201d (Maga) trade policies were leading the world.\n\u201cI think this is the most dangerous period since before world war two. There\u2019s certain similarities right now to the 30s,\u201d he said.\n\u201c[Then president] Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley tariff bill in 1930, widely believed by historians and economists to have taken the depression worldwide. Those who were totally anxious to stay out of all of what was going on in Europe were called \u2018America First\u2019. Sound familiar?\n\u201cSo what do we have today? North Korea, China, Russia, Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies. They\u2019re very different kinds of countries, but they have one thing in common: They hate us.\u201d\nThe interview was conducted before this week\u2019s gathering in Beijing of world leaders largely hostile to the US, a meeting of authoritarians including Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, China\u2019s Xi Jinping and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un that some analysts see as an unprecedented redrawing of the global balance of power.\nMcConnell, however, believes the US should already have been readying itself to meet the challenges posed by the rise of autocrats in other nations, but had not done so. He cited, indirectly, Trump\u2019s failure to handle effectively Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the biggest conflict in Europe since the second world war, now well into its fourth year, on Nato\u2019s border.\n\u201cWhen you talk about preparedness, we\u2019re not prepared like we should be,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWith regard to Ukraine, what we need to do is avoid the headline at the end of the war, \u2018Russia wins, America loses.\u2019 It has huge worldwide implications.\u201d\nBut he said he also saw financial benefits for the US in committing more than $130bn in support for Ukraine\u2019s military defense and humanitarian aid, while Trump has flip-flopped on the issue.\n\u201cFor those who are concerned about the money, I think it\u2019s important to remember that about half of the money was spent in this country, including in Kentucky, [with] 38 states modernizing our own industrial bases,\u201d McConnell said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sent older weapons to Ukraine.\u201d\nAfter leaving office in 2021, Trump told a donors\u2019 conference that McConnell was \u201ca dumb son of a bitch\u201d, and had previously nicknamed him \u201cOld Crow\u201d. In the Herald-Leader interview, McConnell rejected the opportunity to fire back.\n\u201cMy own view about the leader job, whether you\u2019re the president or the leader of one of the parties, is the Ronald Reagan quote that I thought made the most sense. He had what he called the 11th commandment: \u2018Do not speak ill of another Republican,\u2019\u201d he said.\nYet McConnell did appear sensitive to a suggestion he was standing down because he had grown unpopular in Kentucky, amplified by the hostility of Nate Morris, the Republican businessman and Trump ultra-loyalist tipped to succeed him as senator. \u201cI\u2019m a Trump guy, not a McConnell boy,\u201d Morris has said.\nMcConnell said his record spoke for him. \u201cThese suggestions about who\u2019s popular and who isn\u2019t irritate the hell out of me, because when you get into the leadership position, you get beat up,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow do you judge popularity? Seven victories in Kentucky, nine victories in the [Senate Republican] conference.\u201d\nAsked what he thought his legacy would be, McConnell said he was most proud of the 2004 Kentucky tobacco buyout, which paid the state\u2019s farmers to abandon their crops. \u201cAt the federal level it would be the courts,\u201d he added.\nHe declined an invitation to say whether he thought the US was in a better position now than before the Trump era. \u201cI\u2019m not sure enough time has passed to start evaluating who made a difference and who didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nBut he added he had \u201cthought a good bit\u201d about whether people would think he had. \u201cI would like everybody to be able to say, you know, I actually had an impact in a positive way on the country.\u201d"

Messaging in the England camp this week has been about flipping the script to being viewed as the hunters.\n\u201cWe want to reverse it,\u201d Breach said. \u201cWe know we get hunted by every team. Every team wants to beat us. We want to turn it around and say we are hunting them. We don\u2019t want to be people\u2019s prey, we want to be the predator and go at them and show what we can really do.\u201d\nThe head coach John Mitchell added: \u201cI noticed they [Australia] are talking it up and trying to create the \u2018pressure\u2019 \u2026 but we will be hunting them as well.\u201d\nBreach has never lost when playing for England on the previous 49 occasions, something she hails as an \u201cincredible achievement\u201d.\n\u201cEvery time you put on an England shirt you want to win the game,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been fortunate enough to have potentially 50 caps that are winning. Obviously I was involved when we lost the [2022] final but not in the team. You still have that heartbreak and know what that feels like.

The regular captain Zoe Aldcroft is injured, but is expected to return for the quarter-final, while her predecessor as captain, Marlie Packer, is not in the matchday squad.\nMitchell said of his decision: \u201cMeg is a brilliant vice-captain. There are no rights to captaincy because you are vice-captain, simple as that. You have got one of the best No 8s in the world arguably and she has demonstrated excellence for a long period of time. I love leaders that the players can follow through their actions.\u201d"
