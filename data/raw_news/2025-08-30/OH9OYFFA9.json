  "description": "During an interview with 'CBS Mornings,' Sabrina Carpenter discusses her intentions behind the divisive album cover of her latest record, 'Man's Best Friend.'",
  "content": "Sabrina Carpenter discusses the controversy behind the cover of her latest album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d during an interview with \u201cCBS Mornings.\u201d\n\nSabrina Carpenter doesn\u2019t care what \u201cTommy from Arkansas\u201d thinks about her artistic choices.\n\nIn an on Friday, the \u201cEspresso\u201d singer talked about her reaction to the of her seventh album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d which displays Carpenter on her knees at the feet of a male figure pulling her hair.\n\nGayle King read aloud a comment in which a fan said that Carpenter \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways. If it\u2019s satire of how men treat us, it can\u2019t also be a straightforward image of a woman being submissive just because it\u2019s sexy.\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2019all need to get out more,\u201d Carpenter told King. \u201cI think I was actually shocked because I think between me and my friends and my family and the people that I always share my music and my art with first, it just wasn\u2019t even a conversation.\u201d\n\nLast year, Carpenter released the album \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d an LP that became one of the vibe setters for last .\n\nDuring the 67th Grammys ceremony, the record took home two awards \u2014 pop vocal album and pop solo performance for \u201cEspresso.\u201d\n\nHer follow-up effort was released on Thursday; the original artwork dropped months before, on June 11. By June 25, and amid the backlash, the cover on her that was \u201capproved by God.\u201d In it, the former Disney Channel co-star of \u201cGirl Meets World\u201d \u2014 she also sang the theme song \u2014 is simply standing by a man.\n\nDuring the interview, the \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d singer discussed her intentions behind the original cover art that divided fans.\n\n\u201cMy interpretation is being in on the control, being in on your lack of control and when you want to be in control,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI think as a young woman, you\u2019re just as aware of when you\u2019re in control as to when you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201c[\u2018Man\u2019s Best Friend\u2019 is] about the humanity of allowing yourself to make those mistakes, knowing when you\u2019re putting yourself in a situation that will probably end up poorly, but it\u2019s going to teach you something.\u201d\n\nBut what do her parents think?\n\n\u201cMy parents actually saw the photo, and they loved it.\u201d",

In a selfie video posted to his Instagram story, Lil Nas X refers to himself in third person and tells followers, \u201cShe\u2019s gonna be OK, y\u2019all. OK?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s gonna be all right. S\u2014,\u201d he continues, chuckling. \u201cThat was terrifying. That was terrifying.

New video shows him fully naked before his arrest.\nThe 26-year-old \u201cDreamboy\u201d musician did not speak further on his run-in with police, which began early Thursday evening with his naked stroll through Studio City. Lil Nas X was hospitalized for a possible overdose Thursday after officers responded to the 11000 block of Ventura Boulevard to reports of a \u201cnude man walking in the street,\u201d an LAPD spokesperson confirmed to The Times last week.\nPolice also booked the singer at the LAPD\u2019s Valley Jail section in Van Nuys later Thursday morning on suspicion of misdemeanor battery on a police officer. He was charged Monday with four felony counts \u2014 three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting an executive officer \u2014 related to the incident. He allegedly assaulted officers who were trying to take him into custody. At least three were injured, the L.A. County District Attorney\u2019s Office said.\nHe pleaded not guilty on all counts at his arraignment on Monday. He is due back in court Sept. 15. He faces up to five years in state prison if convicted on all charges."

Carpenter is front and center while the man\u2018s face is partially hidden.\nSabrina Carpenter\u2019s forthcoming album, \u2018Man\u2019s Best Friend,\u2019 is set to be released Aug. 29.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Carpenter has ruffled some feathers.\nIn 2023, she received backlash from the Catholic Church after she filmed parts of her \u201cFeather\u201d music video at the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church. The Diocese of Brooklyn said it was \u201cappalled\u201d by the nature of the video and the priest who allowed her to film there was removed from his administrative duties.\nWhen asked about the incident in an interview with Variety, Carpenter responded, \u201cJesus was a carpenter.\u201d She doubled down during her Coachella debut in 2024, wearing a shirt with the same phrase.\nThe singer has also raised eyebrows on her Short n\u2019 Sweet Tour, which returns to North America this fall.

The priest who allowed the filming was stripped of his administrative duties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always funny to me when people complain,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018All she does is sing about this.\u2019 But those are the songs that you\u2019ve made popular. Clearly you love sex. You\u2019re obsessed with it. It\u2019s in my show.

      "text": "Why did Weird Al Yankovic abandon musical parodies for a decade before his bigger, weirder comeback?\n- Share via\nA decade ago, \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic launched his 12th concert tour, which covered 200 shows over two years. Somewhere along the line, the pop world\u2019s foremost parodist was backstage putting on a fat suit \u201cfor literally the 1,000th time\u201d when he was suddenly struck by the desire to \u201cgo out on stage and do a show like a regular musician.\u201d\nSoon after, he launched his \u201cRidiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour,\u201d playing small venues with no video screens, no costume changes, no props or choreography, and none of the song parodies that made him famous. The songs were still comedic \u2014 \u201cEverything I write winds up a little warped,\u201d he says \u2014 but were original tunes that were pastiches of, say, Frank Zappa or They Might Be Giants\u2019 style. He enjoyed it so much he revived the concept a couple of years ago.\nYankovic, 65, has also not released a parody song for more than a decade, in part, he says, because there\u2019s no longer a \u201cmonoculture where it\u2019s more obvious what the hits are,\u201d but also because he enjoys the challenges of those original pastiches, some of which take months for him to develop.\n\u201cI wanted to prove that I\u2019m more than just the parody guy,\u201d says Yankovic, who also co-wrote the 2022 TV film \u201cWeird: The Al Yankovic Story.\u201d The loopy biopic satire starred Daniel Radcliffe and earned Yankovic an Emmy nomination for his writing. (Recently, he also had self-parodying cameo in \u201cNaked Gun.\u201d)\nNow, having proved he was more than the parody guy, Yankovic has re-embraced the whole full-throated \u201cWeird Al\u201d parody thing \u2014 his \u201cBigger & Weirder\u201d tour, which comes to the Kia Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, features plenty of video screens, lots of costume changes and props, and twice as many band members.\nAnd, of course, it features parodies covering decades of pop music: The Knack (\u201cMy Bologna\u201d), Michael Jackson (\u201cEat It\u201d), Madonna (\u201cLike a Surgeon\u201d), Coolio (\u201cAmish Paradise\u201d), Nirvana (\u201cSmells Like Nirvana\u201d) and Robin Thicke (\u201cWord Crimes\u201d).\n\u201cThe smaller tours cleansed the palate for me and were fun for my band and the hardcore fans,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now we\u2019re back playing the big tent. We\u2019re ramping up the silliness.\u201d\nThat includes reviving not just old songs but also old bits. \u201cSome fans feel comfort in repetition, which is OK,\u201d he says. While he\u2019ll change up individual jokes, \u201cwe\u2019re trying not to change too much what people came to see \u2014 if we don\u2019t fulfill their expectations, they\u2019re liable to walk away disappointed.\u201d\n(His fans are committed enough that some even parody his songs with their own rewrites. Yankovic is particularly impressed by Steve Goodie, who parodied his \u201cHardware Store\u201d with \u201cDumbledore\u201d and even has a one-man show called \u201cAL! The Weird Tribute (and How Daniel Radcliffe Got Mixed Up in This Nonsense).\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fun and gratifying and a little \u2018Inception\u2019-like,\u201d Yankovic says, although he has yet to parody Goodie\u2019s parody.)\nAnd so band newcomer Probyn Gregory, a musician who worked with Brian Wilson, Paul McCartney, Billy Joel and Eric Clapton, spends \u201cSmells Like Nirvana\u201d dressed like a janitor and mopping the stage as part of the performance. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing artist, but you can\u2019t have a sense of shame and be part of this entourage,\u201d Yankovic says.\nFor the most part, of course, Yankovic is putting Gregory and the other multi-instrumentalists he hired to more practical uses \u2014 three of them are women because he wanted three-part female harmonies, but between them they also can add percussion, guitar, saxophones and more. \u201cI needed somebody that could play the trumpet and then someone to play clarinet for the polkas,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the arenas, I hear our sound and think, \u2018Wow, this is much, much bigger than it\u2019s ever been.\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s also more layered, with all those instruments enabling him to \u201cstretch and do songs that were out of our reach as a five-piece.\u201d\nTo show off his band, Yankovic drops the funny stuff at one point in each show, covering a classic song and playing it straight. In recent weeks, the group has played Paul Simon\u2019s \u201cYou Can Call Me Al,\u201d George Harrison\u2019s \u201cWhat Is Life,\u201d the Box Top\u2019s \u201cThe Letter,\u201d the Doobie Brothers\u2019 \u201cChina Grove,\u201d and even Helen Reddy\u2019s \u201cI Am Woman.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rotating slot and almost every night is something different,\u201d he says. The fans get into it, he says, although when he talks to them about it, he sometimes finds their reactions \u201cbaffling.\u201d\n\u201cPeople sometimes say, \u2018Oh, you guys can really play. You can really do real music,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you think we\u2019ve been doing? Just because the words are funny, it\u2019s not real music?\u201d\nYankovic is a \u201cpop culture sponge\u201d and has always listened to various music genres, first for pleasure and then for work. \u201cI just like to soak it in and regurgitate it in my own demented way,\u201d he says. But he was also raised on Dr. Demento, and was heavily influenced by Spike Jones, Tom Lehrer, Allan Sherman, and Monty Python. Those comedians taught him that craftsmanship matters even, or especially, when you\u2019re being silly.\n\u201cI think that the craftsmanship is one of the reasons that the humor works so well and I think the best parody is material that emulates the original source as closely as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps the joke if you\u2019re sucked into thinking you\u2019re listening to a particular pop song and then think, \u2018Wait a minute, these aren\u2019t the lyrics I\u2019m used to.\u2019\u201d\nFor that to work, the craftsmanship in his writing and arranging must be matched by the musicianship in his band; he hopes his audience appreciates both sides of that coin.\nHe adds that he thinks he personally has improved over time. \u201cI think I\u2019m a better singer now than I was in the \u201980s and I\u2019m a better musician and a better arranger,\u201d he says.\nEven with the four newcomers, Yankovic relies heavily on his original band. \u201cI\u2019ve got one of the best bands in the world and they do every genre flawlessly, and that\u2019s what helps make the whole act work,\u201d he says. \u201cThe core band has been together for over 40 years and we\u2019re kind of telepathic in the way we communicate now, so we\u2019re a lot better than we were back in the day.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nInside a wooden cabin of a building nestled on the outer edge of Silver Lake, Reuben Cox started messing around with a guitar and accidentally created a new chapter in the history of rock and roll.\nIt was 2016 and Cox, who runs Old Style Guitar Shop \u2014 really more of a guitar shack \u2014 had gotten an idea while taking photos at an Andrew Bird recording session. Producer and musician Blake Mills had brought out a 1950s Harmony electric banjo, which featured a removable rubber mute that could be wedged against the strings. It was a funky little instrument, and the muting device \u2014 designed to take the musical edge off, essentially \u2014 caught Cox\u2019s eye.\nThe next day, Cox started tinkering around to see if something like it would work on a guitar and ended up wandering around Home Depot in search of the right part; in a Dadaist twist, he found the plastic he needed in the toilet aisle. \u201cVery Duchampian,\u201d he told me, laughing as he remembered the process in an interview from the shop. But instead of having the mute applied after the fact, as with the banjo, Cox designed his device into the guitar, with the mute becoming the bridge, where the strings rest near the sound hole. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, well, let\u2019s try this and see what happens,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it ended up being a bull\u2019s-eye.\u201d\nFirst through Mills and then through word of mouth, the rubber bridge guitar, as it\u2019s come to be known, became an Excalibur in the guitar community of Los Angeles and abroad. Musicians started lining up to buy or commission one \u2014 either electric or acoustic \u2014 compelled not so much by what the rubber bridge sounds like, but rather what it doesn\u2019t. With the rubber dampening the fullness of the notes, Cox\u2019s design makes a guitar resemble a banjo or a plucked violin \u2014 and for guitarists in search of something fresh, that lack of resonance actually serves as an inspiration point.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been playing guitar for a really long time,\u201d Cox explained, \u201cyour hands go to the same places and you repeat yourself. It\u2019s this different sound, and it jumbles your mind in a way, and everything feels new. For a lot of people, songs would just pop out of it.\u201d\nWithout ever being formally advertised, the rubber bridge\u2019s popularity grew, and its presence \u2014 gentle, sparse and somewhat haunting while never crowding any vocals \u2014 started to float in on all kinds of notable records. Mills played one on Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cRough and Rowdy Ways\u201d; Aaron Dessner of the National put it on Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cFolklore\u201d; about \u201c80%\u201d of the guitars on Phoebe Bridgers\u2019 \u201cPunisher\u201d were said to be rubber bridge; Jeff Tweedy, who uses rubber bridge guitars regularly on Wilco albums and tours, said in 2021 that he had bought \u201cat least\u201d a dozen of them from Cox directly.\n\u201cIt makes it sound like those high notes are even harder to play because they choke out,\u201d Mills explained to me in a video interview. \u201cBut something about how that sounds sort of fragile is really moving. It\u2019s kind of beautiful.\u201d\nFor a while, the only way to get a rubber bridge guitar was to get one through Old Style or attempt to make one yourself. Cox then started doing rubber bridge conversions on budget-friendly Recording King guitars in order to keep up with demand and have something around for people to buy. And soon small-scale guitar craftsmen, known as luthiers, began to sell their own rubber bridge guitars, which Cox said \u201cbemused\u201d him. But the bemusement stopped in 2024 when Orangewood, a Los Angeles-based guitar company founded in 2018, began offering a mass-manufactured acoustic/electric rubber bridge guitar, which it dubbed the Juniper, starting at $395.\nIn addition to the rubber bridge piece itself, Cox noted, the Orangewood model also uses a similar style of pickup, flatwound strings and tailpiece as Cox\u2019s converted Recording King guitars.\n***\nFitting into the lineage of other prominent guitar innovators like Leo Fender and Ted McCarty, Reuben Cox doesn\u2019t even play guitar. He can hit a few chords, sure, but insists that he has no musical talent, and was only drawn to building guitars as a hobby \u2014 and a way to bring him into a particular social orbit. \u201cI just love being around musicians,\u201d he said, \u201cand people using instruments for their intended purpose.\u201d\nWhen I arrived at Old Style recently, the shop wasn\u2019t yet open, but the Band\u2019s \u201cLonesome Suzie\u201d was playing inside, where Cox, 53, had been getting work done anyway. Tall, with shoulder-length hair and clad in head-to-toe denim, he looked like he could be in a rock band himself. It quickly became clear, though, that he\u2019s more of a mad scientist. There were cobwebs in the corners and work permits crudely taped to the wall. Guitars were strewn all over the place \u2014 some for sale, some being fixed and some just in the process of being scrapped for parts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even work,\u201d Cox told me, pointing to a bizarre guitar with a \u201cWalking Dead\u201d paint job, which he said a neighbor gave to him. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Do you want this?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll take out your trash.\u2019\u201d\nMaking something out of nothing has become the specialty of Old Style. Cox opened the shop at age 37 during the financial crisis in 2010, with less than $10,000 in savings, and just had to make it work somehow. He was previously a photographer who taught classes at Sarah Lawrence in New York, but when his then-wife, who worked in the music business, took a job in Los Angeles, he decided to attempt to turn guitars into a career. After he rented an affordable spot on Hoover Street, he started learning on the job with the help of \u201clots of YouTube-video watching\u201d and a willingness to \u201cchoke down sawdust.\u201d Every aspect of running the store was uncharted territory to him. \u201cI had no idea what to charge,\u201d he said.\nMost guitar shops cater toward high-end collectors \u2014 \u201cblues lawyers,\u201d as they\u2019re disparagingly called, who have money to burn on new and used instruments that can cost as much as cars. But Old Style, with its ramshackle vibe and low prices on salvaged and Frankensteined instruments, started to cultivate a different clientele: young and working-class musicians, to whom the function of the guitar is often more important than its collectability.\n\u201cL.A. is full of musicians,\u201d Cox said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re always looking for a new sound that\u2019s going to inspire them.\u201d Once they have the \u201cconventionally attractive sounds accounted for in their collection,\u201d he explained, it becomes a search for \u201cthe other sounds.\u201d You may want, say, \u201ca guitar that sounds bad on purpose.\u201d\nThe rubber bridge guitar was born partially from Cox being the type to \u201cthrow pasta against the sonic wall and see what sticks.\u201d It was also an attempt to give musicians like Mills a new weapon to work with, usually on the cheap, with a refurbished guitar most would have thought was bound for the dump. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of taking a chance on something that could easily be overlooked as worthless,\u201d Mills said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have seen something in it of merit.\u201d\nAfter Orangewood started selling its rubber bridge guitar, Cox never considered filing a lawsuit. As a small-business owner, he didn\u2019t have time to figure out how, for one, and he didn\u2019t feel like the rubber bridge was something he could really claim ownership of either. This is a key issue in determining just how much of Cox\u2019s design is \u201coriginal.\u201d There have been many attempts to create muting devices on guitars over the years, including some from major companies. The Gretsch Country Gentleman that George Harrison played on the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEd Sullivan\u201d appearance, for instance, featured a crude flip-up muting device.\nBut the function and aesthetic of Cox\u2019s design and Orangewood\u2019s Juniper model are similar, Cox says \u2014 and Orangewood itself cites Cox on its website as \u201cdeveloping and popularizing\u201d rubber bridge guitars. Cox remained silent as the Juniper began to show signs of widespread popularity \u2014 it\u2019s now available at Guitar Center \u2014 but some musicians insisted on coming to his defense on their own.\nMeg Duffy, who makes music as Hand Habits, asked to be taken down from Orangewood\u2019s sponsored artists page, which currently includes Jensen McRae and Billie Eilish, due to what they say was the product\u2019s similarity to Cox\u2019s design. You can see Finneas using a Juniper on Eilish\u2019s NPR Tiny Desk Concert.\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely not the first person to ever put a mute on a guitar,\u201d Duffy told me on a video call. \u201cBut this specific rubber bridge \u2014 it\u2019s so Old Style. It\u2019s just so obvious where and how this happened.\u201d Mills noted that Cox is \u201creally sweet and supportive\u201d of Southland musicians, which is why he believes this touched a nerve: \u201cI think the idea that he\u2019s been disrespected is what makes this such an emotional thing for the community.\u201d\n***\nAfter the Juniper was released, and as the fallout started to trickle into public view, Orangewood reached out to Cox about some kind of settlement or agreement. But according to Cox, any deal would have had to include his sponsorship \u2014 something he didn\u2019t want to provide, given how he alleged they only offered once there was a smoldering PR fire to put out.\n\u201cI think I was just kind of saddened by it,\u201d Cox said, referring to the whole saga, which he is speaking about publicly for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond my control, and it just happens to be relevant to my life, because it\u2019s something I\u2019m selling too. It\u2019s a bummer. There\u2019s nothing very sportsmanlike about it.\u201d\nIn response to interview requests, Orangewood co-founder Eddie Park asked that questions be emailed. In response to the questions, he provided a statement on behalf of the company.\n\u201cSince Old Style\u2019s focus has always been on repurposing vintage guitars and selling locally, and there were other builders who were making rubber bridge guitars before our release, we moved forward with the project,\u201d the statement read in part. \u201cThe intention was to add an affordable option out there \u2014 and we hope players can see the value in both a vintage mod and modern built versions. \u2026 With that, we\u2019ve had some conversations with Old Style at a few different points over the years, and it\u2019s still our hope to find a path forward to serve the broader guitar community.\u201d\nThe history of guitars has been written on a steady stream of ideas and constructions passed between builders and players, often in ways that irked the original creators. Early Fender guitars, for example, bear an obvious resemblance to the midcentury electric guitars of Paul Bigsby. In the end, Bigsby was incensed by the actions of Leo Fender, but that upset is just a footnote on Fender\u2019s path toward creating some of the most beloved instruments available around the globe. (In an ironic coda, Fender bought the Bigsby name in 2019.)\n\u201cMost things are just a twist on a fairly basic idea,\u201d said Brad Tolinski, who co-wrote \u201cPlay It Loud,\u201d a history of the electric guitar, and was the editor in chief of Guitar World for 25 years. \u201cIf [Cox is] producing a good idea, inevitably somebody else is going to come along [and mass produce it], especially if it\u2019s not patented or manufactured in a professional way.\u201d Tolinski added that he believes Cox\u2019s territorialness on the matter is \u201calmost not in the spirit of the history of the electric guitar, which is basement innovators coming up with cool ideas and sharing them with the world at large.\u201d\nRegardless of how he feels about Orangewood specifically, Cox doesn\u2019t seem too bent out of shape about the way things have gone for him, generally speaking. After all, when your quixotic midlife career change succeeds the way his has, there\u2019s not all that much to complain about. \u201cI\u2019m just not that aggro about money,\u201d he said, shrugging off the Orangewood drama, and pointing instead toward the musical rewards of his work. \u201cI\u2019m a hidden footnote on a Bob Dylan record. How could I not be psyched about it?\u201d\nCox truly doesn\u2019t want anything from Orangewood at this point, he said; all he asks is for it to \u201cleave me alone.\u201d He\u2019s just \u201ctrying to live my life in this shack of a shop,\u201d he said, where he wants to continue working on guitars, looking for the next idea that might inspire musicians \u2014 and maybe guitar companies as well.\n\u201cI keep hoping I\u2019ll stumble across a new trick to have in the shop here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t found it yet.\u201d"
