  "title": "Dyson's redesigned air purifier is a feat of engineering, but for me, it fails in one key way",
  "description": "It's out with loops and in with stars for the new HushJet Purifier Compact",
  "content": "\u2022 The HushJet Purifier Compact is Dyson's first desktop air purifier\n\u2022 It uses a new, star-shaped nozzle inspired by jet engines\n\nDyson is known for making some of the best air purifiers on the market, but they're not especially compact. In fact, some of them are downright massive (looking at you, Dyson Big+Quiet). So when I heard the brand was launching its first-ever desktop machine, I was intrigued.\n\nFor the HushJet Purifier Compact, Dyson had to rethink its air purifier design. The models in the current lineup either use loops/amps (as seen on the Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09) or cones (like on the aforementioned Big+Quiet), which are effective but take up a lot of space. In contrast, the new addition has a space-saving, star-shaped nozzle that operates in a completely different way.\n\nThe design is inspired by a jet engine \u2013 or a hair dryer's concentrator nozzle, if you're looking for a more commonplace analogy. The motor is bigger than the star nozzle, so air is compressed as it pushes through. So while it uses the same principle of entrainment (i.e., dragging air in from the rest of the room, making a more powerful jet) as other Dyson purifiers, it does so in a more compact format.\n\n\"The new star nozzle is exciting because it still does entrainment without having that gap in the middle,\" Dyson engineer Sophie Harold told me when I visited the Dyson campus to take a look at the brand's new launches. \"By having the bending edges, it's still encouraging air from the surrounding region to join in with the fast jet. It also means you can have a compact shape when you want something like a desk purifier, without having an amp that might get in the way of your monitor.\"\n\nAll of that sounds very impressive, but in reality, when the HushJet was unveiled, I was a little disappointed. While it's smaller overall than Dyson's other air purifiers, it's not what I'd call compact, and it's certainly too big to sit naturally on a desk. If you're putting it on the floor, really, it's the footprint that's relevant, and at 9.1in / 23cm in diameter, it's not wildly different from other Dyson purifiers. So long as you're not expecting something ultra-compact, however, there are more plus points to this new machine.\n\nThe new star-shaped nozzle has benefits in terms of acoustics \u2013 meaning that despite being inspired by planes, it's actually extremely quiet in operation. I listened to it on its lowest setting in a Dyson labs anechoic chamber (i.e., one designed to stop any echoes \u2013 it was so quiet I could hear my own heartbeat), and I could barely hear it.\n\n\"We often look at something called turbulence of flow, and that's to do with how disordered or chaotic the [air]flow is,\" explained Sophie. \"Imagine people waiting to get on a train and trying to design a shape of a door, which means that they can all get out calmly and peacefully, rather than all banging into each other and causing chaos. So what the star does is, it reduces that chaos. It minimizes the amount of turbulence coming out of the jet, which means, in turn, that the flow itself is quieter, and it's what's enabled us to have that really quiet speed setting.\"\n\nThe final big upgrade on the HushJet is that it uses an electrostatic HEPA filter, which is more energy efficient than a regular HEPA filter and lasts much longer. In fact, Dyson says this filter can last up to five years before needing replacing \u2013 significantly lessening the ongoing costs of running this purifier. The system is fully sealed, so anything that's sucked up stays inside.\n\nFor those of you who are sold on the new design, I have a bit of bad news: you have a little while to wait. The Dyson HushJet Purifier Compact air purifier isn't scheduled to go on sale until early 2026 (that's the date for the UK \u2013 I'm awaiting confirmation of when it's expected to launch in the US and Australia). Pricing information is also TBC.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 There's finally a new flagship Dyson, and it solves all my biggest problems with stick vacuums\n\u2022 Dyson just released the vacuum we actually wanted \u2013 an upgraded V8 that costs basically the same as the original\n\u2022 I've just seen Dyson's surprise new robot vacuum, and it looks great... but why is it so enormous?",

      "text": "What is a HEPA filter, and what is it used for?\nHere's exactly what defines a HEPA filter, and what it's doing in your air purifier or vacuum cleaner\nIf you're shopping for a new air purifier or vacuum cleaner, you'll likely come across the term 'HEPA filter'. HEPA stands for 'high efficiency particulate air' [filter], and it's a standard for filter effectiveness.\nTo be called a HEPA filter, a filter must meet stringent standards in terms of what it can capture from the air that passes through it. This type of pleated, mechanical filter can be effective against a wide variety of airborne pollutants, including dust and dirt, pollen, and even viruses.\nIn this guide we'll look at exactly what a HEPA filter is, what it can and can't do, and the function it performs in household appliances like vacuum cleaners and portable air purifiers.\nWhat defines a HEPA filter?\nTo carry the HEPA name, a filter should meet certain standards as to what it can capture from the air that passes through it. The requirements vary slightly depending on where you live.\nThe ISO standard requires the filter to be able to capture 99.95% of particles with a diameter equal to 0.3 microns. This is the standard used in Europe. The ASME and US DOE standards require it to be able to capture 99.97% of particles of the same size. These are the standards used in the US.\nThe term HEPA has become so common that it's sometimes used as a generic way to describe an efficient filter. To be sure of what you're getting, look for terms like 'true HEPA', and avoid 'HEPA-style' or 'HEPA-like' filters. Either it's a HEPA filter or it isn't; there's nothing in between.\nYou can also get H13 HEPA and H14 HEPA filters. These are specialized medical-grade HEPA filters that are designed to be able to capture even smaller particles. A H13 filter can capture 99.95% of particles as small as 0.2 microns, and a H14 filter can capture 99.995% of those particles.\nWhat does a HEPA filter look like?\nA HEPA filter is made up of tightly woven microscopic fibers, often made from glass or plastic. It's generally pleated, to increase the surface area. As air is pushed though the filter, the fibers trap all but the very smallest particles.\nThere is some maintenance required to ensure that the filter keeps working as it's meant to. Some (but by no means all) HEPA filters are washable, in which case follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions. Generally, HEPA filters will need replacing completely every 6 to 12 months, depending on how they're being used. That represents an ongoing cost, and because HEPA filters aren't biodegradable, there's an environmental impact too.\nWhat can a HEPA filter capture?\nA HEPA filter can capture a wide range of airborne pollutants, including dirt and dust, pet dander, pollen, mold, and liquid aerosol. However, the particles need to be big enough to be trapped \u2013 some very tiny fragments of pollen or pet dander might make their way through the filter, for instance. They can also be effective against viruses, within reason.\nThere are limits to what a HEPA filter can do, though. It might be obvious, but the particles need to be pushed through the filter in order to be captured. If the filter isn't airtight (an aspect that's not included in HEPA testing), particles may leak through around the sides. And a HEPA filter won't do anything for particles stuck to surfaces in your home, either.\nHEPA filters can't capture all airborne pollutants. Air purifier brand Molekule explains that they're limited in their effectiveness against VOCs (airborne chemicals that often come from off-gassing from building materials, common household products, and furnishings) because they \"tend to bounce off the fiber media\" in a filter. They can also struggle to capture ozone, which doesn't stick to HEPA fibers. Your air purifier might still be effective against these types of particles, though, using other filtration methods.\nWhat does a HEPA filter do in an air purifier?\nMost of today's best air purifiers will include a HEPA filter. A purifier's main function is to remove harmful particles and improve air quality, and a HEPA filter will play a key role in that. Sometimes it'll be combined with other types of filter to enable it to tackle a wider range of pollutants \u2013 for example, there might also be a carbon filter to absorb gases and odors. Here's more on how air purifiers work and what air purifiers can capture.\nWe're talking about portable air purifiers here. It's rare for a HEPA filter to be used as part of a general HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) system. That's because it will restrict the airflow to a significant degree, meaning you'd need far more powerful fans to keep the air moving through the system.\nWhat does a HEPA filter do in a vacuum cleaner?\nSome of today's best vacuum cleaners have a HEPA filter. It tends to be the final element the airflow passes through before making its way out through the vents. Most dust and debris will go straight into the dust cup, or get caught by a pre-filter that sits in front of the motor to stop that from getting clogged. The HEPA filter would follow, to capture the tiniest particles that have made it through, and prevent them being released back into the air.\nIn order to be effective, however, the system needs to be sealed. If it's not airtight, the particles will leak out of any gaps that exist before the airflow reaches the exhaust port. Consider too that even if a vacuum is sealed when new, gaps can appear over time (as this Wirecutter writer found when he tested his with a smoke machine).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt's also worth being aware that it's not just the exhaust air being emitted from your vacuum that you need to consider. This 2008 study found that the action of pushing a vacuum cleaner (with or without a HEPA filter) across a carpet is enough to kick a significant volume of particles up into the air \u2013 that's true even if it's switched off, but especially if it's switched on. So if you suffer from allergies, it's best to stay out of the way while vacuuming is happening, where possible.\nJust because a vacuum has a HEPA filter that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good vacuum, either. A less efficient filter will be plenty effective enough for many people, especially when used in an air-sealed system.\nWhat is a MERV rating?\nAnother related term you might come across when looking at appliances with filters is a MERV rating. MERV stands for 'Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values', and it's a measure of a filter's efficiency at capturing larger particles between 0.3 and 10 microns.\nThe higher the MERV rating, the better the filter is at trapping specific types of particles. So a MERV 1-4 filter can trap around 20% of particles between 3 and 10 microns in size, while a MERV 13-16 filter can be effective against particles as small as 0.3 microns. The scale goes up to MERV 20, and a filter that's MERV 17 or above is considered a true HEPA filter.\nThe main difference between a higher-rated MERV filter and a HEPA filter is that the latter is better at capturing tiny particles. Both will be effective against larger airborne particles.\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "Blueair just launched the best looking air purifier I've ever seen \u2013 and it's time for other brands to up their design game\n- The Blue Signature purifier looks like a footstool and doubles as a side table\n- Various customization options including colored covers and feet\n- It comes with Auto, 'AirSense' and Night modes\nBlueair has just launched the best-looking air purifier I've seen, and it has left me wondering exactly why so many other models look so ugly. Even within our own best air purifier ranking you'll find more than one clinical, white plastic appliance \u2013 surely not an aesthetic you'd find in many people's living rooms or bedrooms.\nIn contrast, the new Blue Signature looks like a piece of furniture, which is especially apt as it can double up as one too \u2013 the top can be used as a table. (Those aware of the IKEA Starkvind table-cum-air-purifier should be reassured that this is an altogether more successful fusion, visually speaking).\nAs standard, the Blue Signature comes with a pale grey or dark blue-grey cover, but you can pay extra to unlock a range of other color options (including beige, taupe and dark green). You can also choose to add a metal ring base or stubby feet, the latter of which really amp up the footstool vibes.\nI wrote 'cover' just then, but what I really meant was 'pre-filter', because this wrapper is the first line of defense against particles in the air. It's machine-washable, to keep it hygienic and operating efficiently.\nThe brand is fond of this approach \u2013 the Blueair Blue Pure 411i Max and Blueair Blue Pure Mini Max also have removable, washable covers that are available in different colors. It's a simple solution but I'm a big fan; it makes the Blueair purifiers blend far more seamlessly into a home environment filled with other soft furnishings.\nTime to freshen up\nWhat about functionality? The Blueair Blue Signature looks strong there, too. There's a rather overwhelming seven-stage filter setup, starting with that washable pre-filter, and including an electrostatically-charged particle filter and carbon to absorb gases and odors. Blueair has added 'OdorFence' a \"patent-pending, bio-based technology\" designed to break down gases and remove odors more efficiently.\nMy only slight concern is that the Blue Signature, like all of Blueair's purifiers, uses a 'HEPASilent' filter, rather than true HEPA (the brand insists it's more effective than a HEPA filter, as well as operating more quietly).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe interface on the purifier itself has been redesigned so it counts down the time to when your air will be clean. It looks like a touchscreen, which I assumed might cause problems with the whole 'doubles as a table' thing, but you can lock the display via the companion app so you don't end up changing your settings every time you go to put your coffee down.\nYou can set fan speeds manually, but Blueair has also included three special modes. In Auto mode, the purifier monitors air quality and responds to keep the air clean. More unusual is the AirSense mode, where the purifier automatically switches on at intervals throughout the day, even without a drop in air quality, to keep the air feeling fresh. Finally, there's a Night mode that dims the LEDs and drops to the lowest fan speed.\nThis newly launched air purifier has already got a little discount at Amazon \u2013 there's 13% off, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it does equate to $60 off. It's designed to blend seamlessly into your home environment, even doubling up as a side table. It's suitable for use in large rooms, and includes multi-stage filters to remove all kinds of pollutants and odors.\nThe Blueair Blue Signature is available to buy in the US now. If you head to Blueair.com , prices start at $449.99, but on Amazon there's a limited-time discount to make it a little more affordable. It's not yet out in the UK, but is due to go on sale in August. We don't have pricing details yet, but if it's in line with US pricing it might be around \u00a3330. We've just started testing it out, and will have a full review live alongside the UK launch.\nYou might also like...\n- Can't decide which Dyson vacuum is right for you?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nIf you want to breathe easy in a space that\u2019s up to 100sqm / 1,076sqft, you\u2019re going to want to consider the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet...if you can afford it. As the name suggests, this purifier is both big and quiet, even with the fan running at full bore. There are a multitude of sensors to help it detect and filter quite a few different common pollutants, then project the clean air up to 10 meters. It truly is a fantastic purifier fan, but it will cost you an arm and a leg.\nPros\n- +\nRecognizes several pollutants\n- +\nPowerful fan\n- +\nVery easy to move around\nCons\n- -\nBig in size and price\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde: Two-minute review\nJanuary 2024: The Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde was initially only available in the US and Australia, but one model is now available in the UK as well. We've updated the price section of this review to reflect that.\nIt was not love at first sight with the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde, but after just one day of using it in my own home, I don\u2019t want to ever be parted from it \u2013 strong words for a rather big and bulky purifier fan, but I stand by it. It\u2019s completely different from any of Dyson\u2019s previous home purifiers \u2013 in terms of both design and functionality \u2013 although it shouldn\u2019t be confused with the HEPA Big+Quiet that\u2019s specifically for commercial spaces.\nLike its name suggests, it is big and it is quiet. It\u2019s been made to circulate clean air in large rooms while standing in a corner instead of in the center of a space to be at its most effective. Dyson says it can service spaces that are up to about 100sqm / 1,000sqft in size, projecting filtered air up to 10m. Moreover, the angle of the propelled air can be adjusted (there are three to choose from), so it doubles up as a powerful fan as well which, at full bore, isn\u2019t louder than 56dB.\nDyson has adopted cone aerodynamics to more than double the Coanda effect the brand uses in its other purifiers. According to the British brand, this allows the Big+Quiet to process as much as 87 liters of air per second. This is a hard metric to measure, so I\u2019m taking Dyson\u2019s word on this, but it\u2019s easy to believe if you happen to be in the path of the propelled air.\nAt this point, I think it\u2019s important to point out that there are two Big+Quiet Formaldehyde models identified by their color schemes. For this review I was sent what is the Dyson-exclusive model and is more expensive because it has an additional CO2 sensor and a second filter inside (see the price section below for more details). I found the CO2 sensor very useful as you can never tell if your home needs ventilating or not. I was a little horrified at how quickly CO2 can build up in a space \u2013 if I leave my windows closed for about an hour for any reason, the CO2 levels can go from under around 400ppm (which is good) to about 1,500ppm (which isn\u2019t that good). If left in Auto mode, the Big+Quiet will dynamically change its fan speed to circulate the stale air but that\u2019s also an indication that you need to open some doors or windows as high CO2 levels can cause fatigue, headaches and loss of focus.\nWhat the two models share are a whole bunch of other sensors that detect several common pollutants, including dust, pet dander, pollen and formaldehyde (emitted from several household products including new furniture and mattresses), as well NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) from car fumes and volatile organic compounds (or VOCs) from aerosol sprays like deodorants. These are then filtered by a HEPA filter that complies with the H-13 standard, the highest rating for a purification system. This means that the Big+Quiet has a fully-sealed filtration system that can capture up to 99.95% of air particles as small as 0.1 microns, and Dyson promises that the filter used in the Big+Quiet Formaldehyde will last you up to five years.\nA tiny onboard display can cycle through the metrics of the different pollutants it\u2019s filtering and shows you what the levels are in your home. These metrics can also be viewed on the MyDyson app if you wish to connect your device to your phone \u2013 which is advisable as that will also push out automatic firmware updates to the machine.\nThat\u2019s a lot of features that will cost you a lot of money \u2013 it is Dyson\u2019s most expensive domestic-use purifier to date. If you have the budget for it \u2013 and, more importantly, the space for it in a corner somewhere \u2013 it could well be worth your while if you\u2019re concerned about your health, especially during wildfire season that\u2019s becoming more common with each passing year.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde review: price and availability\n- Announced May 2023\n- Two models available in US, Australia and Singapore; only one in the UK\n- Price starts at $999 / \u00a3879.99 / AU$1,499\nWhile Dyson announced the Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde range in May 2023 globally, it was released for Australian shoppers first.\nThere are two colorways \u2013 Bright Nickel / Satin Dark Blue and Satin Dark Blue / Gold, with the latter being a Dyson exclusive only and will not be available to purchase from a third-party retailer. It\u2019s also the model that will get you all the bells and whistles the Big+Quiet can offer, including the CO2 sensor and an additional K-Carbon filter that can capture three times more NO2 than Dyson\u2019s other purifiers. This model will set you back $1,099 / AU$1,599 (around \u00a3830).\nThe cheaper model \u2013 which misses out on the above two features \u2013 can be purchased from Dyson and authorized retailers for $999 / \u00a3879.99 / AU$1,499.\nDyson says that the HEPA filter in the Big+Quiet will not require replacing for about five years \u2013 five times longer than the ones used in its other air purifiers \u2013 which could make it a little more cost effective than spending on, say, the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde that costs $849 / \u00a3599 / AU$1,149, although this is also a heater and, thus, more versatile than the Big+Quiet.\nDyson has promised that the Purifier Big+Quiet will be available in other markets subsequently, but no timeline has been revealed and neither have the prices.\nThere\u2019s no denying that the Big+Quiet range is expensive, especially when you consider alternatives like the Shark Air Purifier 3-in-1 \u2013 which is only available in the US at the time of writing \u2013 is $400. But if you have a large, open home whose air you\u2019re keen on keeping clean \u2013 or at least monitoring \u2013 then this could be worth investing in.\nValue score: 3.5 / 5\nDyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde specifications\n| Price: | from $999 / AU$1,499 (about \u00a3780) |\n| Power settings: | 10 + Auto |\n| Room coverage: | up to 100sqm / 1,076sqft |\n| Filter type: | Glass fiber HEPA filter + K-carbon filter |\n| Dimensions: | 830mm (h) x 434mm (l) x 415mm (w) |\n| Weight: | 11.9kg |\nDyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde review: Design\n- Looks like a large bowl atop a cylinder\n- Needs remote control to operate\n- Designed to be left in the corner of a large room\nWhen I first laid eyes on the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde at its Sydney unveiling, I really wasn\u2019t impressed by its looks. \u2018Big\u2019 and \u2018bulky\u2019 were the words that occurred to me. Then the Dyson engineer moved the machine\u2026 gently, with one finger. Yes, it\u2019s big \u2013 but only compared to Dyson\u2019s other home purifiers and bladeless fans \u2013 and looks a little clunky, but it\u2019s not as heavy as it appears. Even then, it's a good thing there are hidden wheels that move very smoothly over hard floors (wood and tile). They don\u2019t move as well over carpet, though, and that\u2019s when the Big+Quiet really feels bulky.\nIt looks unlike any other Dyson purifier that has preceded it \u2013 it\u2019s basically a large bowl that sits atop a perforated metal cylinder, each of which is packed separately in the box for shipping. You simply adjust the bowl over the cylinder till it clicks into place. It looks heavy, but it\u2019s not and can easily be lifted.\nThe rim of the bowl is large, enclosing a smaller dome inside, in the middle of which is a square display that shows the metrics of the different pollutants it\u2019s filtering. You can cycle through them by using the information button (denoted by a lowercase i) on the remote control. Below the display is a small power button \u2013 it\u2019s black on black and barely visible. Between the rim and the inner dome are perforations from where the jet of clean air is propelled into a room.\nThe perforated cylinder houses the filters \u2013 two in the case of the more expensive blue-and-gold model (SCO and K-Carbon filter) and the one SCO filter in the cheaper option. When you need to replace or check a filter, you can quickly unclip the bowl using the toggle switch at the back, then lift off the cylinder by pressing on the two red buttons located across from each other on the inside. A small unperforated strip on the cylinder is where the machine\u2019s tiny remote attaches magnetically.\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, there are wheels on the base of the Big+Quiet, but they have been designed to be invisible unless you turn the whole machine upside down. They\u2019re extremely smooth on hard floors, needing just the slightest push to roll, but require some elbow grease to move on a low- or medium-pile carpet. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s going to be nigh on impossible to move over a high-pile carpet or rug.\nWhile you\u2019ll either love or hate the overall design aesthetic of the Big+Quiet, you have to keep in mind that it's been built so it can do its thing while standing unintrusively in a corner somewhere. Other purifiers will need to be placed in the center of a room and the fan kept at its most powerful for them to be at their most effective in a small space. But how many of us really plop our purifiers in the middle of a room?\nDesign score: 4 / 5\nDyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde review: Features\n- Three-phase whole machine filtration\n- Breeze mode\n- Modified filter and the CO2 sensor is handy to have\nThe top of the Big+Quiet has been designed to harness the power of cone aerodynamics that, Dyson says, more than doubles the airflow passing through the machine in comparison to its other purifiers. Dyson promises that this machine can process up to 87 liters of air per second which, while being a hard metric to measure, is easily believable when you consider the size of the machine and feel the jet of air being projected at full force.\nThis propelled air is supposed to be mimic the movement of a spring breeze \u2013 a Dyson engineer has apparently cracked the code on how to make this happened. I, however, am not quite sure I'd call it a 'breeze', but I found the air circulation very pleasant.\nThis air movement is what Dyson is calling the Big+Quiet\u2019s Breeze Mode and there are 10 fan levels to choose from. The air can be projected in three different angles \u2013 0\u00ba or parallel to the floor, 25\u00ba and 50\u00ba. I found that having it set at 0\u00ba was ideal for using in the bedroom at night, while the other two suit larger spaces like living rooms. During my testing period, it hit 37\u00baC / 98\u00baF on a few days in springtime in Sydney, and I didn\u2019t need to switch on my air conditioning as the Breeze mode was more than enough to keep me comfortable in both a smaller bedroom at night, as well as in a larger living room space with the fan going at the highest setting.\nThe Big+Quiet\u2019s main function, however, is air purification. Filtration here is the same three-step system we\u2019ve seen from Dyson\u2019s best air purifiers, but with significant improvements. It adheres to the HEPA H-13 standard, which means 99.95% of particles as small as 0.1 microns will be captured, and it\u2019s fully sealed so none of them can escape back into the air.\nThe HEPA filter, according to Dyson, is made up of 21 meters of borosilicate microfibers pleated 459 times to make it fit within the cylindrical base, while also giving it plenty of surface area to capture pollutants and last a few years. It uses selective catalytic oxidization (SCO) to break down the certain pollutants, particularly formaldehyde, and promises to capture them at a molecular level \u2013 again, something that\u2019s not possible to test chemically outside of a lab, but I\u2019m willing to take Dyson\u2019s word for it.\nAccording to Dyson, the Big+Quiet\u2019s formaldehyde sensor is powerful enough to detect molecules that are \u201c500 times smaller than 0.1 micron\u201d. The filter then breaks it down into CO2 and water, which then gets let out into the room as part of the stream of cleaned air. It\u2019s important to note that the CO2 from formaldehyde breakdown is so negligible that it won\u2019t be an issue at all.\nIf you opt for the more expensive Big+Quiet model, you\u2019ll get an additional K-Karbon filter inside that uses a layer of carbon to capture odors, some organic compounds as well as up to three times more NO2 from car fumes (handy if you live on or near a main thoroughfare) than the standard SCO filter.\nWhile you get full control of the Big+Quiet via its little remote control, you can also control it via the MyDyson app. A virtual remote control is displayed on the app and everything you can do with the physical remote, you can do on the app. You can also get graphical representations of what the machine is filtering. However, you can only get a per-day look. I wish Dyson would create a way to see a weekly or monthly report to get a broader overview of its performance.\nFeatures score: 4.5 / 5\nDyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde review: Performance\n- 10 fan settings\n- Auto mode is excellent\n- Quieter than Dyson\u2019s other purifiers\nYou need some specialized spaces and equipment to properly test a purifier, but I used it in my own home for a couple of months before coming to the conclusion that the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde does everything it promises.\nWhile you can choose a fan setting between 1 and 10, there\u2019s an Auto mode here that can be your default setting when it\u2019s not too hot. In Auto, the Big+Quiet carries on filtering if it needs to, but will power down to Breeze mode level 1 if ventilation isn\u2019t needed. The moment it detects too much CO2 build up or more household pollutants while you\u2019re cooking, the power of the fan automatically increases. If there\u2019s nothing for it to do, it will idle but not switch off. However, the automatic increase of Breeze mode setting occurred only once during my testing period and I have since not been able to replicate this scenario\u2026 which is probably for the best as the CO2 was in the red that time.\nWhere other purifiers don\u2019t necessarily pick up particles in the air unless they\u2019re really close by, the Big+Quiet is capable of detecting pollutants from a couple of meters away. For example, it was able to pick up that there were more VOCs in the air when I was sitting two meters away using some nail polish remover. I usually have the screen displaying CO2 (which is also its default), but the display changed to the VOC screen automatically to indicate the rise and that it was actively filtering certain particles. I even found that the smell of the remover didn\u2019t linger as long as it usually does when no purifier or fan is on.\nWith the Big+Quiet, I found a lot of food odors tend to stay indoors for a long while unless there's good cross-ventilation \u2013 these also disappeared quicker than before I started using the Dyson.\nWhat I really like is how quiet it is. Considering I have to shout to be heard over the Dyson Pure Hot+Cool when it\u2019s at full power, I fully expected to do the same again. On the contrary, the hum of the Big+Quiet, even at full bore, disappears into the background as white noise.\nI don\u2019t have a sound meter to make accurate measurements, but by using a smartphone app to measure the decibels, I got 60dB at level 10. This is with the phone\u2019s mic held just below the main jet of air and standing less than a foot away from the machine. In comparison, the Pure Hot+Cool, which is half the height and a fraction of the diameter of the Big+Quiet, clocked up 62.9dB. The smaller machine\u2019s sound is also higher pitched in comparison to the big one, making it harsher.\nDyson says it\u2019s been able to lower the noise levels in the Big+Quiet by redesigning the motor for its purifiers. Sharp edges have been reduced and rough surfaces smoothened out to reduce air turbulence inside the machine, thus lowering noise levels.\nPerformance score: 4.5 / 5\nShould I buy the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde?\n| Attribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | It\u2019s expensive, but it is a Dyson and its filter should last up to 5 years. | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Design | It\u2019s unlike anything Dyson has designed for the home but it serves a purpose and it excels at that purpose. | 4 / 5 |\n| Features | It may not work as a heater, but it purifies, works as a fan, services a large space that most home purifiers would struggle with, and it does it all without being too noisy. | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Performance | Everything Dyson says the Big+Quiet can do, it does well. Even as a fan, which isn\u2019t its main functionality, it excels. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want a powerful home purifier\nIt\u2019s big for a reason \u2013 the Big+Quiet fits in a powerful motor that can purify up to 87 liters of air each second, plus it\u2019s got a plethora of sensors to detect and filter a multitude of pollutants.\nYou live in a large home\nThe problem with most home purifiers is that they can service only a small space. If you have large rooms \u2013 like an open-plan modern home \u2013 you\u2019ll need multiple purifiers if you want the entire space monitored. The Big+Quiet takes care of that problem.\nYou want detailed metrics\nIf you\u2019re like me and you want to know what you\u2019re breathing, you\u2019ll get all the information on screen as well on the app.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou live in a small apartment\nYou could save money picking up a smaller, less powerful alternative if you need to take care of smaller spaces.\nYou want a multifunctional purifier\nWhile the Big+Quiet can purify air and double as a fan, it doesn\u2019t heat up a space. If you\u2019d rather get an all-in-one device for all seasons, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere.\nYou\u2019re on a tight budget\nThe Big+Quiet is far from affordable and you could get two multifunctional purifiers that work as heaters and fans for the price of one Dyson.\nAlso consider\nPerhaps the best alternative to the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde would be another Dyson \u2013 the Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde. Not only is it cheaper, it\u2019s also a fan and heater, making it a little more versatile for a little less money. However, it won\u2019t do as well in a large space as the Big+Quiet. You can read our in-depth Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde (HP09) review to know more.\nIf you\u2019re in the US, you could consider the Shark Air Purifier 3-in-1 as an alternative that costs a fraction of the price of the Big+Quiet. This is also a multifunctional purifier that can cool and heat as well, and it\u2019s quiet too. Our tester was quite impressed with this purifier \u2013 read our full Shark Air Purifier 3-in-1 with True HEPA review to know more. This purifier, however, isn\u2019t available in all markets.\nIf you\u2019re in Australia, perhaps the Breville The AirRounder Plus Connect could be a good alternative. It\u2019s got a strange, fully rounded design, but it is quite effective in purifying, heating and cooling a space up to 40sqm. While we haven\u2019t reviewed it on TechRadar, I tested the Breville AirRounder Plus Connect for our sister publication T3 a while back.\nHow I tested the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde\n- Used every day for about two months\n- Left it running continuously for 3 days on Auto mode\n- Exposed it to various products, like deodorants and nail polish\nI used the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde for about 8 weeks almost every single day. During that period, I tested it in different rooms, including a bedroom, the living room, open-plan dining and kitchen, plus a home office nook.\nI tested all three Breeze modes and also left it in Auto mode to see how it would perform. During this time, I monitored how well it detected aerosols like deodorants, as well as how it handled strong odors from perfumes and food. I also had it running while I was cooking to see if the metrics changed.\nI closed doors and windows to see how the CO2 sensor would perform and to see if the fan would automatically power up to ventilate the room.\nI used an iOS app to measure the noise levels emitted when it was at full power (level 10) and used the same app to see how loud the Dyson Pure Hot+Cool can get when running at full bore as a comparison. I also compared the sound level to the Breville The AirRounder Plus Connect.\nRead more about how we test\n[First reviewed October 2023]\nWhile she's happiest with a camera in her hand, Sharmishta's main priority is being TechRadar's APAC Managing Editor, looking after the day-to-day functioning of the Australian, New Zealand and Singapore editions of the site, steering everything from news and reviews to ecommerce content like deals and coupon codes.

      "text": "The best air purifier 2025: 8 excellent purifiers, tried and tested by experts\nAdding one of the best air purifiers to your home is a great way to ensure cleaner, purer air, free from the kinds of allergens and general nasties that surround us daily. They can help lessen the symptoms of hayfever and asthma by tackling airborne allergens, and during the winter can help ensure fresher air when you might be keeping your windows closed.\nSome of our picks here are also designed to remove odors, and others can double as a fan to keep you cool in the summer. Most brands will take noise levels into account, but many options here have a dedicated quiet / night mode, so those easily bothered by noise can have their purifier running overnight if they wish.\nTo put together this ranking, we've tested a wide range of options from market leaders like Dyson, Blueair and Meaco. We assess setup and ease of use, plus performance efficiency to see what they pick up and how quickly they can clear it. If you want more info on what to expect, check our guides to how air purifiers work and what air purifiers can help with. Alternatively, read on for our pick of the best air purifiers on the market.\nThe best air purifier for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBased on our testing, the best air purifier for most people is the Blueair Blue Pure 411i Max (called the Blueair Blue Max 3250i in the UK). It delivers solid, speedy performance for an affordable price, and looks good while doing it.\nThe design is compact and lightweight, with the working parts in the white plastic section at the top, and a particle and carbon filter in the base. This filter is wrapped in a machine-washable, fabric cover, which acts as a pre-filter, capturing some particles before they reach the true, replaceable filter within. The outer layer is available in a range of colors, to suit your decor.\nOperation is simple: a button to power on and off, and another to cycle through the various operation modes (auto, night mode, and fan speeds one to three). We found it quiet in operation \u2013 our tester could comfortably sleep or watch TV with it on in the same room without it being disruptive.\nA quick side-note on the main filter. This is referred to as a 'HEPASilent' filter, which \u2013 as far as we can tell \u2013 isn't a true HEPA filter, but rather Blueair's own patented creation. Blueair asserts that it's actually more effective than a HEPA filter, but it won't have been through the stringent, standardized tests required for a filter to carry the HEPA standard.\nNevertheless, on test we found the performance impressive. It detected and cleared contamination from spraying dry shampoo in 10 minutes, and was sensitive enough to detect a drop in air quality when our reviewer used hair products in the next room.\nThere are some limitations, though. On Auto mode, this purifier can't automatically detect any particles smaller than PM2.5. However, it is capable of capturing smaller particles and things like VOCs \u2013 it's just that you might need to manually select a higher operation mode. If you leave it on Auto, it'll likely just stay on the lowest fan setting.\nFor the price, though, the Blueair Blue Max 3250i is an excellent buy. It's not the smartest air purifier on the market, but it's effective, does exactly what most people will need it to do, and delivers excellent value for money.\nRead our full Blueair Blue Pure 411i Max / Blue Max 3250i review\nThe best budget air purifier\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Levoit VeSync Core 300S is the best air purifier you can buy if you're on a budget. Although its very affordable, it's far from basic. Our reviewer was impressed by its wide range of smart features, including an intuitive and insightful app and Alexa and Google Home compatibility.\nTo test the purifying power of the Levoit 300S, we sprayed dry shampoo and deodorant and also placed the purifier in the kitchen while cooking a variety of meals, including roast chicken and steak, and had it in the office with a scented candle lit. When set on Auto, it responded almost immediately to the change in air quality, and within 30 minutes on each test it had improved the air quality from 'Bad' to 'Very Good'.\nThere main concession you will need to make for that low price is that on test, we noted some delays in fan and app response time. We noted that performance wasn't as good in larger rooms \u2013 in which case you'll want to there's also a Levoit Core 600S, which comes with a CADR of 697m\u00b3/h.\nSpecs-wise, it's quite similar to the Blueair purifier at #1, so it's worth checking what deals are available when you need to make a purchase \u2013 there's a chance there won't be a massive price gap between the two models. Alternatively, if you just need to purify a small room and are happy to sacrifice some advanced features, check out the Govee model at #3 and the Blueair Blue Pure Mini Max at #7, both of which are much cheaper.\nRead our full Levoit Core 300S True HEPA air purifier review\nThe best air purifier for small rooms\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe best air purifier for small rooms is the GoveeLife Smart Air Purifier Lite. This space-saving gadget is lightweight and compact, effective in small rooms, and very affordable. You can control it via the touchscreen buttons on top or use the companion app, and there's also support for voice assistants if you prefer.\nFiltration is in three waves: the pre-filter takes care of hair, lint and fibers, followed by a true HEPA filter for finer particles and an activated carbon filter to take care of odors, smoke and VOCs. Replacement filters are affordable, but it's a shame to see the pre-filter isn't washable.\nOn test, the GoveeLife Smart Air Purifier Lite was efficient at freshening the air in our reviewer's living room, and operated nice and quietly too. It's not powerful enough for large rooms, but it's perfect for smaller spaces. There's no Auto mode or air quality data, which will be a drawback for some, but isn't surprising for the low price. You'll have to manually choose between Low, High or Sleep modes.\nHowever \u2013 unusually for this price \u2013 there is the option to create your own custom routines. So you could ask it to run on High for an hour and then switch to Sleep for two more hours, for instance. Less useful is the other bonus feature, an Aromatherapy mode whereby a fragrance pad is placed below the air vents. Our reviewer found the results underwhelming in practice.\nAnother good air purifier for small rooms is the Blueair Blue Pure Mini Max (#7). That one has a machine-washable pre-filter but lacks a HEPA filter, and doesn't offer the option to create a custom routine.\nRead our full GoveeLife Smart Air Purifier Lite review\nThe best Dyson air purifier\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDyson is known for its slick 'loop amplifier' air purifier-fan combos, and our favorite of the bunch is the Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09. It can detect a wide range of particles and contaminants, including PM2.5 and PM10, VOCs, formaldehyde, and nitrogen dioxide, and there's a useful Auto mode where the TP09 will kick into action when it detects contaminants. In our tests, it noticed and cleared particles efficiently, and while it didn't work as well when it came to removing odors from the air, we've yet to find an air purifier that can do this well.\nWe also found the HP09 responsive and easy to use. The companion app reports changes in air quality promptly, provides additional control options, and fills in background info about the air quality in your home.\nDyson markets this as a fan-purifier combo, and while the airflow is decent, and the oscillation impressive at up to 350-degrees, it's not as powerful nor as consistent as the best fans on the market. A useful addition with this model is the ability to switch the fan 'off' (or more specifically, redirect the airflow out the back of the machine) when you don't want to be bothered by a breeze in the room.\nAs you might expect, it's not cheap, but there are occasional deals to take the price down. Plus, given the range of contaminants the TP09 can take care of, the responsive controls, and useful data provided in the companion app, you're getting plenty of bang for your buck.\nLike the general vibe but not sure the TP09 is exactly the right model for you? There are a number of Dyson purifiers and fans that offer slightly different things at different price points. They include the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde, which we've included at #6 as our top pick for big spaces.\nRead our full Dyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09 review\nThe best air purifier for customization\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Alen BreatheSmart 45i is a great all-rounder, as well as offering a number of customization options. There are four different filter options, so you can pick based on your specific needs. 'Pure' is the default, and the version we tested, and is a HEPA filter designed to capture allergens, dust and mold. Upgrade to 'Fresh' to add in activated carbon to take on household smells, chemicals and VOCs. There's also a specific 'Odor' filter, which can tackle even more pungent smells, and a 'VOC / Smoke' filter comes with extra carbon specifically to absorb noxious gases and secondhand smoke.\nThe styling is understated, and the swappable front panel means you can change it up to suit your decor. The panel on the top of the unit allows you to control pretty much everything you'd want to, which is great if you \u2013 like our tester \u2013 initially miss the fact that there is also a companion app.\nApp confusion aside, setup is straightforward and it's easy to use, too. After our month-long test, our reviewer noted how quickly this purifier could identify drops in air quality (indicated at a glance by color-changing LEDs). It also proved fairly efficient at cleaning the air, although you will need to pick your filter based on your needs, and not expect the basic Pure option to tackle odors, for example.\nWhile it's far from the priciest air purifier here, be aware that different customization options will all incur an extra fee. Our tester felt the high build quality, and efficiency of purification justified the mid-range price. Note that while you can get your hands on one of these at Amazon UK, it's far more expensive than it is in the US, so not a particularly good recommendation for Brits.\nThe 45i is designed for small or medium-sized rooms \u2013 if you're dealing with a larger space then consider the Alen BreatheSmart 75i sister model, which has a higher CADR.\nRead our full Alen BreatheSmart 45i review\nThe best air purifier for large spaces\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you need to tackle a large space, the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde is the best air purifier for you. Don't skip over that 'Big' in the name; this is one chunky purifier. Despite being a bit of a behemoth, it's also (again, in the name) very quiet to run, even on the maximum setting. The angle of propelled air can be adjusted to three different angles, which means it can double as a fan, too.\nInside, you'll find a fully sealed, advanced filtration system including a HEPA H13 filter (a more advanced version of standard HEPA) plus activated carbon for odors and a SCO (Selective Catalytic Oxidization) filter. Unusually, this purifier can also destroy formaldehyde \u2013 one reason for the premium price. There are two versions: the standard BP03 and the BP04, which comes with an additional CO2 sensor and is the one we reviewed.\nDyson is very good at moving air around, so it's no surprise to find the Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde is ultra-efficient. It can apparently project air over 32 feet, which our reviewer commented was \"easy to believe if you happen to be in the path of the propelled air\".\nAll that functionality comes at a very high price. For many people it won't be necessary \u2013 and indeed for at-home use, most people will get on better with the TP09 at #4. But if you have a large space that needs efficient, effective purification, you'll struggle to find anything better.\nRead our full Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde review\nAnother excellent small air purifier for compact spaces\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Blueair Blue Pure Mini Max is another great option for small spaces. This is a pint-sized sibling of the Blue Pure at #1, and although it has fewer features, it still does enough to make it useful, and it'll fit neatly on your nightstand or desk.\nThere are no automated settings, just three fan speed options that you manually cycle through at the touch of a button. There's also no app or screen, so you won't have access to any air quality data. On test our reviewer noted that the air felt noticeably fresher, although it couldn't make much of a dent in cooking smells. It's quiet in use, although do note that even though it's not designed to be a cooling fan, it emits a cold breeze through the vents, which might be unwelcome if used in winter.\nThe Particle and Carbon filter will need to be replaced periodically. Blueair suggests it can last up to six months, even with continuous use, and there are indicators to show when the filter is nearing the end of its life, and when it's time to replace it. Replacements are pleasingly affordable, and we were also pleased to note that the pre-filter is machine-washable \u2013 one area where it has the edge over our other small room pick, the GoveeLife Smart Air Purifier Lite at #3. Said pre-filter is also available in a range of colors to suit its location in your home. Overall, a solid, simple choice for small spaces.\nRead our full Blueair Blue Pure Mini Max review\nAnother effective, affordable air purifier\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Meaco MeacoClean CA-HEPA 76x5 WiFi Air Purifier is slightly pricier than our budget pick (#2) but it's a great performer for a very affordable lower mid-range price. It's also very quiet air purifier \u2013 in fact, our tester noted that if they hadn't checked in the app and found the air quality rated as '0' (Good), they wouldn't even have been aware that it was running.\nThis purifier is super easy to set up; all that our reviewer needed to do prior to using for the first time was to remove the plastic wrapping from around the filter, plug it in and download the Smart Life app. The air purifier can be controlled via this app or the display screen on the appliance itself. The app provides insights on indoor air quality, plus you can also set schedules \u2013 which isn't possible through the display screen.\nIn our opinion, the app could do with a little refinement, perhaps showing air quality history from earlier on in the week. Note that the location setting isn't particularly accurate, either. Design-wise, the MeacoClean isn't the most attractive, but it doesn't necessarily matter if you just want something that does the job.\nRead our full Meaco MeacoClean CA-HEPA 76x5 WiFi Air Purifier review\nSpecs comparison table\nModel | CADR | Control | Filters | Modes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n1.

On test, we found it efficient and quiet to use. The pricing is affordable, too.\nRead the full Levoit Core 600S review\nHow we test air purifiers\nAll of the air purifiers featured in this guide have been tested by the editors on TechRadar. They've been reviewed at home in real-life situations, used daily across a minimum of a two-week time frame. We've worked our way through all of the settings available through the app (if it has one) or on the device, while also checking out the device maintenance options.\nTo test the air purification monitoring and speed, we've sprayed heavy particulate aerosol (dry shampoo), lit a scented paraffin candle, and also lit a scented incense stick. Noise levels have been recorded using a mobile phone decibel meter, and we've tracked other changes such as temperature via the app, and used the device in various rooms throughout the home to see if that changes the results.\nIn some instances, we will continue to use the air purifier once our reviews are live. This will allows us to evaluate performance over the long term, across several months or years.\nRead more about how we test.\nHow to choose an air purifier\nWhen you're choosing the best air purifier for your home, there are a few key things to consider before you buy.\nSetting a budget can help reduce the options to suit what it is you have to spend. Our guide features air purifiers from between $149.99/\u00a3149.99 for the Levoit VeSync Core 300S to $769.99 / \u00a3699.99 / AU$1,149.00 for the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09. However, a budget price doesn't necessarily mean a lack of features, and vice versa.\nFor example, the Levoit VeSync Core 300S may well be voted the best budget air purifier but it offers features such as app control with detailed insight into air quality as well as voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. The Dyson Purifier Cool Autoreact, on the other hand, costs $549.99 / \u00a3499.99 and offers neither an app nor voice control abilities.\nA budget can also help you to decide on the features you'd like, and whether or not you want a smart air model. All of the air purifiers featured in this guide can be controlled via a display panel or a remote control, but not all have an app.\nDuring testing, we found that an app can deliver greater insights to the air quality inside the home. There's only so much information that the display panel can show, and if you want to monitor the air quality over a time period, then this is only possible through app support.\nSome air purifiers can also cool and / or heat the room. Both the Dyson air purifiers and the Shark 3-in-1 Air Purifier, Heater & Fan with NanoSeal HEPA in this guide offer such capabilities.\nBut, of course, how well the air in a room is purified \u2013 or the room temperature adjusted \u2013 will depend on the size of the room. For example, the LG PuriCare AeroTower Air Purifying Fan with True HEPA and UVnano LED can purify a room size of up to 818sq ft, whereas the Blueair Blue Pure 411 Auto is suitable for a room size of up to 441sq ft. Opt for an air purifier that isn't suitable for use in your room will mean that it ultimately won't be able to deliver optimum performance.\nFinally, check the spec of each air purifier before hitting the \"buy\" button. Look for the product dimensions and weight (in case you want to move it between rooms). And note the noise levels plus additional modes such as Sleep mode, so that you won't be kept awake if you're using the air purifier at night.\nDo air purifiers work to remove dust?\nDust, and pollens, are some of the larger airborne particles present, so most air purifiers will be able to capture and filter these out from the air.\nDo air purifiers cool the air?\nUnless the air purifier has been specifically designed to purify and cool the air \u2013 the Dyson Purifier Cool Autoreact, for example \u2013 the model will not cool the air. A fan that circulates air, or a portable air conditioning unit that actively lowers the temperature, would be the better way to cool the air.\nDo air purifiers remove smells?\nYes \u2013 air purifiers come with carbon filters that remove the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that cause smells. These could be cooking odors, scented candles or aerosols.In our tests, we found that the air purifiers removed the lingering smells of candles, incense and dry shampoo.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "I've just seen Dyson's surprise new robot vacuum, and it looks great... but why is it so enormous?\nThe Spot+Scrub Ai has plenty of promising features, but it's really rather chunky\n- Dyson has announced the Spot+Scrub Ai robot vacuum, which will go on sale in 2026\n- It features AI mapping and stain detection, plus roller mopping\n- There's also a bagless auto-empty dock with water tanks and mop cleaning\nDyson does a lot of things extremely well, but historically robot vacuums have not been one of them. Its current effort \u2013 the Dyson 360 Vis Nav \u2013 fell flat thanks to its lack of features, unjustifiably high price tag and inexcusable navigation issues.\nSo I was more than a little surprised to see, hidden in the current tsunami of new Dyson launches, a new robot vacuum. On paper, the Dyson Spot+Scrub Ai looks far more promising than its predecessors. Frankly, it needs to be: the market is moving at breakneck speed, and today's best robot vacuums are incredibly capable and packed with features.\nThe USP is in the name: this bot uses AI to spot stains, and then go back and forth over them until it knows they're gone. Dyson says it can identify nearly 200 objects and substances, using and AI-powered camera and vibrant green, dirt-illuminating laser similar to the one found on the floor heads of today's best Dyson manual vacuums.\nI got a sneak preview at the Dyson Unveiled event in Berlin (running adjacent to IFA 2025) and the main think that struck me is the size. This bot is really very chunky compared to competitor models \u2013 both in width and height of the robot itself, and the size of the dock. Not one for small homes, then.\nInside, there's LiDAR and 'AI vision' for mapping and navigation \u2013 something this model really needs to get right, because all the fancy features in the world won't make up for a robovac that can't find its way around, as the Vis Nav proved.\nPrevious Dyson robovacs have focused entirely on the vacuuming bit, but this is the first one that can also mop. What's more, the mopping setup looks good: there's a roller mop that's continually fed with fresh water as it spins, and it can kick out to one side by 1.6 inches / 4cm to get right up close to the edges of rooms. I saw that extending mop in action \u2013 take a look in the video above.\nThis is a relatively new style of robovac mop, but it looks like a winner. We were impressed with it on the Eureka J20, and it's getting more popular amongst new releases \u2013 a particularly advanced version appears on the new Dreame robovac, for example.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLean, mean, clean machine\nThe other big oversight with Dyson's previous robovac was that it came with only the most basic of docks, which charged the bot but nothing else. Here, the brand has gone over and above to rectify the issue. The dock accompanying the Spot+Scrub Ai can not only empty dust but also refill the onboard water tanks and wash and dry the mop pads.\nIn fact, Dyson has introduced some of its considerable vacuum cleaner expertise into the auto-empty setup, adding cyclones and making use of a bagless system that removes the ongoing annoyance and cost of purchasing new bags.\nI'm a little disappointed to see Dyson opting for a more generic look here. While the previous D-shape was divisive (TechRadar's reviewer liked it; no one else did), the purple-blue color scheme was distinctively Dyson, and I was quite taken with the fact the whole thing looked like you'd put a Dyson stick vac in a hydraulic press.\nHere, there are a few pops of red and purple, plus a nod to the vacuum cyclones at the top of the dock dustbin, but it's not quite as unique as the Vis Nav. Although one design decision that might raise a few eyebrows is the transparent dustin in the dock. Dyson is convinced everyone wants to see what's been sucked up \u2013 I'll leave you to make your own call on that.\nIf you can get over the size, the next hurdle might be pricing, which at time of writing is TBC. The brand can get away with charging a premium in markets where it's leading the way \u2013 its cordless stick vacuums genuinely push the envelope when it comes to performance and features, but Dyson doesn't have the same cachet in the robot vacuum space. I'm interested to see how this bot is positioned in the wider market.\nYou might also like...\n- There's finally a new flagship Dyson, and it solves all my biggest problems with stick vacuums\n- Dyson just released the vacuum we actually wanted \u2013 an upgraded V8 that costs basically the same as the original\n- Are Dyson vacuums worth the premium price? After testing most of the leading brands, here's my take\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde offers a full suite of air treatment, with heating, cooling and air purification, making for a much more space-efficient appliance than investing in separate devices. However, this and its many value-adding design and smart features do inflate the price significantly.\nPros\n- +\nPowerful air treatments, all-in-one\n- +\nCan detect and destroy formaldehyde\n- +\nApp is incredibly useful\nCons\n- -\nVery expensive\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nOne-minute review\nThe changing seasons can make it difficult to precisely predict the indoor temperature and air quality, yet with the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 you can prepare for any eventuality.\nThe Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is a convenient all-in-one air treatment device that acts as a fan, a heater and sophisticated air purifier all in one. It's also packed with smart functionality and useful design features. It'll come as no surprise that all that tech \u2013 and from a brand like Dyson \u2013 it also comes with a fairly hefty price tag.\nHowever, for that high price it delivers decent bang for your buck. You're essentially getting three appliances in one \u2013 it's one of the best fans and one of the best air purifiers we've tested, and the heating is an excellent bonus when the cold weather sets in, too.\nNot only can this air purifier destroy the carcinogenic formaldehyde, but it can do so without the need for a replacement filter; its catalytic filter is self-sustaining, trapping formaldehyde molecules into water and CO2. The rest of the filtering is handled by two pairs of replaceable filters: HEPA H13 particulate filters and carbon filters that Dyson claims work with its catalytic filter to remove 99.95% of particles from the air down to 0.1 microns.\nStanding at 30 inches / 76.4cm tall, the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is smaller than some of Dyson\u2019s other air treatment appliances, and its 8.6in / 220mm diameter base is pretty space-friendly, meaning it can sit happily on a table or the floor. The fan can be tilted, too, and offers 350 degrees of oscillation, making it easy to optimize airflow regardless of where you position the device. It's also aesthetically beautiful, with a futuristic \u2013 yet not obtuse \u2013 design.\nThe Hot+Cool Formaldehyde comes with a remote that attaches to the top of the unit magnetically, but there\u2019s also a sophisticated, easy-to-use app that allows remote control. The latter offers generous insight into the air quality in your home, tracking not only the temperature and humidity, but also the levels of pollutants and particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10, VOC, NO2, HCHO). You can also check on the status of the Hot+Cool\u2019s filters via the app, ensuring they\u2019re replaced in good time.\nAside from the hefty price, our only real criticism of the Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is that it lacks the ability to automatically switch on when it detects changes in the air unless it in Auto mode. Otherwise, it\u2019s an absolute dream to have and use around the home, comprehensively caring for your lungs in ways you might not even know you need. If the price is too much for you (understandable), the brand makes a number of alternatives with slightly different features, many of which come in at a slightly more affordable price. Our Dyson fan guide runs through your options.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThat's the short version; read on for my full Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 review.\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 review: price & availability\n- List price: $769.99 / \u00a3699.99 / AU$1,149\n- Worldwide, including US, UK and Australia\nThe Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 will set you back $769.99 / \u00a3699.99 / AU$1,149, and is available to buy directly from Dyson, as well as via various third party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, John Lewis and Currys. It comes with a remote and a set of HEPA + carbon filters ready for installation. Replacements cost $79.99 / \u00a365 / AU$99, which Dyson recommends you do once every 12 months to ensure optimal performance.\n- Value for money score: 3.5 out of 5\nDyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde air purifier review: Specs\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Air purifier |\n|---|---|\nPrice | $769.99 / \u00a3699.99 / AU$1,149.00 |\nPower settings | 10 + Auto |\nOscillation | 350 degrees |\nFiltration | 0.1 microns (PM2.5, PM10, VOC, NO2, HCHO) |\nFilters | HEPA, carbon, and catalytic |\nDimensions | 30 x 8.6 inches / 764 x 220mm (H x D) |\nWeight | 12.6lb / 5.5kg |\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 review: Design\n- Compact and easily moved\n- LCD screen\n- Bladeless fan\nAs is to be expected from Dyson\u2019s high-tech and futuristic devices, the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is a stylish and svelte unit, taking the form of many of the rest of Dyson\u2019s bladeless air treatment products.\nMeasuring 30 inches x 8.6 inches / 764mm x 220mm (H x D), the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is pretty compact, especially considering the number of features it houses. It\u2019s light enough at 12.6lb / 5.5kg to be moved around your home fairly easily, and the 5.9ft / 1.8m cable is a decent length to ensure it can be positioned where you need it.\nThe base of the unit is encased in matte gold, with holes through which air is drawn in to be filtered, moving to the top-mounted bladeless ovular fan. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll find the HEPA and carbon filters; the catalytic filter sits deeper within the machine, filtering out pollutants and particulate matter from the air.\nThe fan offers 350 degrees of oscillation, and can be tilted up or down. Note, too, that the airflow can be set to move both forward and backward, for those occasions you don\u2019t want the air directly projected at your face. Just beneath the fan is a small LCD that displays live data.\nThe Hot+Cool Formaldehyde arrives with a matching gold remote, which, rather handily, attaches to the top of the fan magnetically. It\u2019s pretty easy to knock off, though, especially when the fan is tilted.\n- Design score: 4.5 out of 5\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 review: Performance\n- Quiet night mode setting\n- Rapid purification\nOn test, I was super-impressed by the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09, which performed brilliantly for heating, cooling and purifying.\nThe fan offers 10 power settings, allowing you to customize the speed of airflow, which spans from a soft waft to a powerful blast of cold or hot air. It\u2019s surprisingly quiet in operation, too; in night mode, the fan auto-adjusts to the soft, quiet level 4, and its lowest setting is whisper-quiet, registering just 40db on our decibel meter \u2013 which is the equivalent volume of a quiet library. Even on its highest setting, the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde registered 60dB, which is about as loud as a spoken conversation.\nWith the app and the controller, you can adjust the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde\u2019s oscillation, rotation, and direction \u2013 all of which are incredibly useful if, like me, you find yourself needing to tweak your environment throughout the day.\nMy apartment is often victim to sudden changes in temperature, and so I was a big fan of its auto mode as a way to keep my workspace at a consistent, comfortable temperature. The device can heat up to 98\u00b0F / 37\u00b0C (pretty quickly, too), taking my flat from 21\u00b0C to 23\u00b0C in 15 minutes on its max setting (8.5ft / 2.6m per second airflow) and oscillating by 45\u00b0, cooling it quickly and effectively back down to a less uncomfortable temperature.\nOn the purifying side, I tested the capabilities of my Hot+Cool Formaldehyde by spraying my dry shampoo aerosol near the unit. The device quickly detected the change in air quality, indicating that the level of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) had risen on both the LCD panel and in the app.\nNext, I tried lighting incense and a candle to see how the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde handled the particulate matter. Just a meter away from the purifier, the candle and incense stick spiked the air quality from \u201cGood\u201d to \u201cVery Poor\u201d according to the Dyson app \u2013 slightly alarming \u2013 but it managed to restore healthy levels within 10 minutes of the purifier being turned on. When I repeated the test without turning on the purifier, it took an hour just to clear the \u201cVery Poor\u201d range.\nDyson doesn\u2019t achieve a full home-run with the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde in my books, largely due to the absence of automatic features unless you're in Auto mode. While the device can be toggled within the app to continuously manage the air quality, frustratingly it can\u2019t be programmed to switch on when it detects low air quality. I\u2019m sure there are clever ways to retrofit this feature using home hubs, but not having this as a native feature feels like such a missed opportunity \u2013 and it\u2019s a concern that users have raised with previous Dyson air treatment devices.\nHowever, overall I was really impressed by how responsive and rapid the Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde was on test. Since my home has some issues with mould and damp, and is situated right next to a major road, having greater visibility and control over my home\u2019s air quality is a huge boon.\n- Performance score: 4.5 out of 5\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 review: app\n- Device maintenance options\n- Remote air purifier control\n- Near-live air quality data\nThe remote control is great, but it\u2019s the app that swayed me on the overall effectiveness and usefulness of the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09.\nConnected to the Dyson app, as per other Hot+Cool and air treatment products from the manufacturer, you can keep track of the air quality and temperature within your home, the lifespan of the filters, and also make use of several fantastic smart features.\nThese include the timer and schedule, which will be handy for those looking for a low-maintenance device. In addition, you can also turn on continuous monitoring exclusively through the app, if you want round-the-clock insights into the air quality in your home. Control of the Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde using Siri and Alexa is also possible, making this a fantastic addition to your smart home setup. It\u2019s a little annoying that you have to set this all up in the Dyson app; I much prefer using my Apple Home application and seeing all of my devices in one place.\nIt\u2019s a wonderfully easy-to-use and slick app, complete with a virtual controller for those occasions you don\u2019t want to grab the physical one, delivering lots of value-adding information, right down to the levels of specific pollutants in your home. This was best seen via the dry shampoo and flame tests, during which the app presented an overview of the overall air quality, PM2.5, PM10, and VOC levels to help determine how I should treat my air.\nI particularly enjoyed the app\u2019s fan direction control, which allowed more granular control than the physical remote. It\u2019s impressively low latency, too.\nWhen testing the responsiveness of the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde to pollutants, it was a little daunting watching the live data numbers slowly tick up as the volume of particulate matter in my home increased.\n- App score: 5 out of 5\nShould I buy the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09?\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s powerful and attractive, but just so pricey. | 3.5/5 |\nDesign | While the Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is beautiful, its bronze-only colorway is a little limiting. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | If it could automatically turn on and respond to air conditions outside of Auto mode, it would be a home-run. Sadly, it can\u2019t. | 4.5/5 |\nApp | The app is user friendly, and adds even more to an already fantastic device. It would be nice if it played better with iOS and Alexa apps. | 5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want a powerful, all-in-one air purifier\nThe Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is fantastically powerful, performed well on test, and offers excellent management of your home\u2019s air quality, barring air conditioning and dehumidifying.\nYou want something with a lasting, formaldehyde-destroying impact\nThis device doesn\u2019t just remove formaldehyde from your home; Dyson claims it destroys it. Plus, you never need to replace its catalytic filter, because it\u2019s self-maintaining.\nYou like a good app\nIf having a value-adding and data-heavy app sounds like your thing, the Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is a fantastic choice. The app is a must-have to make the most out of this high-ticket device.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want a device that will automatically treat your home\nFor all its strengths, the Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde\u2019s immense capabilities are a little wasted without the ability to automatically treat your home. Unless you\u2019re able to keep a hawk-like vigil on your Dyson app, you might not even recognize when the air quality in your home drops to know to turn on the device.\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nIt\u2019s brilliant that the Dyson Hot+Cool Formaldehyde can handle heating, cooling and air purification; but not everyone requires all this functionality, and even if you do, it\u2019s still a pretty pricey way to go about it.\nAlso consider\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Blue Pure 411 Auto | LG PuriCare AeroTower Air Purifying Fan | MeacoClean CA-HEPA 76x5 WiFi Air Purifier |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | $140/ \u00a3179 | $400 | \u00a3230 |\nDimensions | 416.7 x 7.9 x 7.9 in/ 42.5 x 20 x 20 cm | 44.1 x 10.4 x 10.4 in/ 112 x 26.4 x 26.4cm | 19.6 x 11.9 x 10.6 in/ 49.7 x 30.3 x 27 cm |\nWeight | 3.8lbs/ 1.68kg | 27.6lbs/12.5kg | 10.1lbs/ 4.6kg |\nSpeeds | 3 + Auto | 10 | Unknown |\nFiltration | Three stage filtration system with HEPASilent particle and carbon filter | Advanced true HEPA | H13 HEPA filter |\nAir sensors | Yes | Yes | Yes |\nIf you would prefer a fan to keep to cool instead, here are a couple of options to consider...\nDreo Pilot Max\nThis tower fan is a top option for those on a budget, and it doesn't lack in features.

I tried all of the various settings available through the app, as well as checking out the device maintenance options.\nTo test the air purification monitoring and speed, I sprayed heavy particulate aerosol (dry shampoo), lit a scented paraffin candle and also lit a scented incense stick. I also measured the volume with a mobile phone decibel meter and tracked the changes in room temperature through both the Dyson app and my in-home thermostat.\nRead more about how we test.\n[First reviewed April 2023]\nJosephine Watson (@JosieWatson) is TechRadar's Managing Editor - Lifestyle.

      "text": "Dreame's new air purifier has a tracker that means you can't escape the clean air\nThe AirPursue PM20 acts as your own personal pure air machine\n- The AirPursue PM20 is Dreame's first ever air purifier\n- It can detect your presence and direct pure air wherever you go\n- Cal also double up as a heater and circulating fan\nIf you dream of having your own personal cloud of clean air, Dreame has you covered. The brand has just launched its first-ever air purifier, called the AirPursue PM20, and it has a rather unusual USP: it's fitted with radars, which enable it to detect people and blast clean air in their direction. It's not a feature that I've seen in all my time writing about the best air purifiers on the market.\nEnter a room and the AirPursue will sense your presence and switch itself on, and then use its big, swiveling air-blaster cup to shoot clean air in your direction. The cup can rotate through 120 degrees, and follow you wherever you go within a radius of 16.4 feet (5 meters). The marketing materials suggest it'll be particularly helpful for allergy-sufferers. (This purifier also bears a striking resemblance to the Dyson Big+Quiet, but I'm sure that's just a coincidence.)\nIt's not just an air purifier, either. Like a number of Dyson purifiers, it can double up as a circulating cooling fan in warmer weather, and act as a heater when it gets cold, too. So while it's bulky, it's doing its best to justify taking up your floorspace.\nThe tracking technology is the most unique part, but it also looks solid in terms of other features. There's a 4-layer filter system, including H13 HEPA filter. Like any good air purifier, it has the ability to capture and remove airborne allergens, bacteria, and other pollutants from the air (here's more on what air purifiers can help with). Rather more unusually, it also promises to break down formaldehyde. The PM20 will monitor air quality and report back on the precise levels of allergens, formaldehyde, TVOC, and other contaminants via an LCD display.\nThere's a companion app for remote control, plus voice assistance if you want to go hands-free.\nPrice & availability\nThe AirPursue PM20 is the flagship model, and comes with a list price of $999. It's designed for larger spaces, with a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) of 400 m\u00b3/h. There's also a smaller PM10 model for $899.99, which is designed for medium-sized rooms and has a CADR of 300 m\u00b3/h. Both are available to buy now in the US and Canada, direct from Dreame, and are also due to land on Amazon.\nYou might not be aware of Dreame. It's a newer home appliance brand, but in my opinion one to watch \u2013 it already features in TechRadar's best cordless vacuum guide and best hair dryer guide. I'm intrigued to see how its purifier debut performs \u2013 we'll have a review model winging its way to a tester already, and will report back as soon as possible.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like...\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe triple-threat Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan would make an excellent choice for those looking to save some space. It\u2019s an efficient little fan and heater, and its purifying functions work well, though its detection abilities are basic. You could get a better-skilled Dyson purifying fan for less if you\u2019re content having a separate heater, but overall, if you have the budget, you\u2019ll be more than happy with the HP10.\nPros\n- +\nReal-time PM2.5 and PM10 readings\n- +\nPrompt particle detection and reaction\n- +\nTilts forward and back\n- +\nAll three functions work well\nCons\n- -\nAwkward size and heavy\n- -\nCould get better, smarter alternatives separately\n- -\nNo app control\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10: two-minute review\nDo you have money to spend and want to save on space? If so, the multi-talented Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan heater is a compact solution for combating chilly days or hot nights, while helping to purify airborne nasties, too.\nThe Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan heater is available at multiple retailers in the US, UK, and Australia at a list price of $529.99 / \u00a3549.99 / AU$899, though I\u2019ve spied the occasional discount in the US from the likes of Dyson and Amazon, who are both offering the HP10 for just under $400 at the time of writing.\nThe price is on the steep side, considering you can get a far smarter air purifier like the Dyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09 for a similar price or sometimes less. You can also get the full-sized tower fan version, the Dyson Purifier Cool Gen1 TP10, for a whole $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$100 cheaper. Neither has a heat function, admittedly, but if I had the budget, I\u2019d be looking to buy the TP09 when it\u2019s on offer, and buy a separate heater.\nAt just 30.2 inches / 77cm tall, the HP10 is a stumpier, yet slightly chunkier and heavier, version of the TP10. It\u2019s too chonky to sit on a tabletop, and has a relatively short loop amplifier, but it makes up for this with its ability to be tilted, so it\u2019ll cool more than just your knees \u2013 happy days.\nThe HP10 has a lot of skills to its name, with 10 fan speeds, a multi-temperature heating mode, and oscillation of up to 350 degrees. Thanks to its low noise level, I found it easy to sleep with the HP10 next to my bed, and found the tilting element useful for perfecting the airflow angle.\nAuto mode performed well during testing, though it is basic, as it only has the ability to detect and react to PM2.5 and PM10 contaminants. It\u2019s important to note that \u2013 as is the case with many other air purifiers on the market rocking a HEPA H13 filter \u2013 just because a device may not have the capacity to detect and react to other contaminants like VOCs, it doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t helping to filter them out.\nOverall, I really like the multi-functional format of the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan heater, and was impressed with its performance, so if you\u2019ve got the budget and don\u2019t want a particularly smart air purifier, you won\u2019t be disappointed with the HP10. But personally, if I had the space (and the budget), I\u2019d opt for the smarter TP09 and buy a separate little fan heater for colder days. If you\u2019d like to take a look at other options, I suggest checking out our pick of the best air purifiers and the best fans for options we highly recommend.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 review: price & availability\n- List price: $529.99 / \u00a3549.99 / AU$899\n- Available now in the US, UK, and Australia\nThe Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan heater is available to purchase at Dyson, Amazon, and multiple other third-party retailers, and has a list price of $529.99 / \u00a3549.99 / AU$899.\nThis isn\u2019t a terrible price if you\u2019ve got your heart set on a Dyson appliance and desperately want all three functions in one small package. But considering you could get the impressively performing Dyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09 purifying tower fan for a similar cost, or even less, or spend $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$100 less on the taller Dyson Purifier Cool Gen1 TP10 purifying fan and just buy a separate heater, I\u2019d recommend thinking over your priorities before buying.\nThat being said, the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan heater can occasionally be found for less. For example, it\u2019s \u201cDyson Week\u201d on the Dyson US website at the time of writing, which has knocked the price down to a far more acceptable $399.99, and Amazon US is offering the HP10 for $399 too, so it\u2019s worth checking if any discounts are available.\nThe Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 uses the same filter as many of Dyson\u2019s other purifier models: the 360 Combi Glass HEPA + Carbon air purifier, which has a list price of $79.99 / \u00a375 / AU$99. Dyson recommends the filter be changed every twelve months, based on usage of twelve hours a day, so it\u2019s important to factor this in as an ongoing cost. Most air purifiers need regular filter changes, though some, like the Shark NeverChange or the Blueair Blue Pure 411i Max / Blue Max 3250i, employ helpful washable pre-filters in an attempt to extend the lifespan of their single-use filters.\nOverall, if you\u2019re a Dyson fan with the right budget who wants three appliances in one conveniently compact package, you\u2019ll be happy enough with the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan heater. If you\u2019d rather sacrifice a little more floor space over creating a noticeable void in your bank account, however, you may want to consider individual appliances instead.\n- Value score: 3.5 out of 5\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 review: specs\nType | Purifying fan heater |\nFan speeds | 10 |\nOscillation | 45, 90, 180, 350 degrees |\nTimer | Yes, in Night mode |\nCADR (Clean air delivery rate) | Requested |\nFilter | HEPA H13 with activated carbon |\nParticle sizes detected | PM2.5, PM10 |\nDimensions | 9.8 x 9.8 x 30.2 inches / 25 x 25 x 77cm |\nWeight | 11.7 lbs / 5.3kg |\nControl | Onboard power button, remote control |\nAdditional modes | Auto, Night mode |\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 review: design and features\n- Three functions in one package: cooling, heating, and purifying\n- Short in stature, but can be tilted for better airflow position\n- No smart features\nWith its bladeless loop amplifier and metallic details, the Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan heater has the classic Dyson aesthetic we know and love. The white and nickel color of the sample I tested is available in the US, UK, and Australia, but Dyson also offers a white and gold version on their UK site, and a white and silver model in the US.\nAt first glance, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little on the short side for a tower fan, and it\u2019s too chunky and heavy to easily fit on a tabletop, but its ability to tilt forward and backward means that the airflow can be easily directed. I think I may actually prefer this format to the taller tower fan loop amplifiers, as the airflow feels a bit more concentrated.\nWeighing 11.7lb / 5.3kg, the HP10 is surprisingly heavy for its size, and I can only assume it must be the heating element that makes it heavier than its taller siblings.\nOther than the power button, there are no controls on the HP10 itself. All of the controls are accessible via the slightly curved remote, which sits magnetically on top of the loop amplifier when not in use. It houses buttons to increase and decrease the fan speed or heat level, a button to switch back to cool mode, an info button, and buttons to toggle oscillation, auto mode, or Night mode.\nBy pressing the info button, I could cycle through the different detail screens on the front of the purifying unit. This includes graphs showing air quality changes either recently or over a 24-hour period, PM2.5 and PM10 readings, filter status, and the ambient temperature.\nAt this price point, it\u2019s a little disappointing that the HP10 doesn\u2019t have any smart features. This means that historical data is limited to the little 24-hour on-screen graph, and control is limited to the remote.\nWhen Auto mode is enabled, the HP10 will react accordingly to rising or falling levels of PM2.5 or PM10 contamination. There\u2019s a timer function that can be used if you don\u2019t want the HP10 running all day if you\u2019re out of the house, but it\u2019s tied in with Night mode, so it can\u2019t be used without the display being dimmed.\nThe HP10 comes with a 360 Combi Glass HEPA + Carbon air purifier filter, which is an H13-grade HEPA filter and is understood to capture 99.95% of particles as small as 0.2 microns. Though the HP10 only automatically reacts when it detects PM2.5 or PM10 contaminants, it\u2019s worth noting that its HEPA and carbon filter are still capable of capturing other airborne nasties, like VOCs.\n- Design score: 4 out of 5\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 review: performance\n- Easy to operate\n- Tilt function proved useful\n- Reacted promptly to PM2.5 and PM10 contaminants\nIt was really easy to use the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10; all the buttons on the remote were self-explanatory, and it was pleasingly responsive and had a good range.\nThe Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 reacted quickly when I sprayed dry shampoo toward it from around two feet away. It took just a couple of seconds to detect the contamination, instantly spiking the PM2.5 and PM10 readings, turning them purple to indicate very bad air quality. The readings were lowered to around 30 micrograms in around a minute, which is considered good on Dyson\u2019s air quality scale.\nThe strength of the airflow was fine for its size, but noticeably less than the larger tower fan models. I could feel a cooling breeze from two feet away on fan speed one, four feet on speed five, and 10 feet on top speed ten.\nI felt the benefit from the heat mode pretty quickly. The screen showed a little thermometer with the current room temperature noted, and I could raise or lower the temperature a degree at a time using the plus and minus buttons on the remote.\nNight mode worked as expected, with the fan speed dropping to four and the display dimming, either permanently or on a timer of up to eight hours. I liked that I could still increase the fan speed in Night mode, as that means no choosing between light pollution or overheating on a hot night. Being able to tilt the HP10 was also really helpful when setting the airflow to the right angle at bedtime.\nThe HP10 was lovely and quiet, with a volume of just 30dB when running on fan speed one, 41dB on speed five, and 53dB on speed ten when I tested it. These readings were very similar to those recorded from the TP09 and TP10, with the HP10 operating as quietly as a soft whisper on its lowest setting, and about as loud as moderate rainfall at its highest.\n- Performance score: 4.5 out of 5\nShould I buy the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10?\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nValue for money | The multi-functionality and great performance of the HP10 means you\u2019re getting okay value for money here, but you could get better value for money by purchasing a cheaper Dyson purifying fan and teaming it with a separate fan heater. | 3.5/5 |\nDesign & Features | The HP10 is a great space-saver, and although it may be a little on the short side, the tilt function makes it easy to direct the airflow. At this price, though, I\u2019d really expect it to have some smart features. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | All three of the HP10\u2019s functions performed well; it heated up quickly, had strong, cooling airflow, and reacted promptly to contamination during testing. | 4.5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want to save space\nOne clear benefit of the HP10 is that it packs three efficient functions into one compact appliance. This means you can control the heating, cooling, and purifying with just one remote, and it\u2019ll only take up one power outlet.\nYou want a good degree of oscillation\nThe HP10 offers four different oscillation angles of 45, 90, 180, and 350 degrees. This, combined with the manual tilt function, makes it easy to position the airflow where you want it.\nYou want something simple to use\nThanks to the clearly labelled and responsive remote and the large LCD screen, it\u2019s satisfyingly easy to operate and review data from the HP10.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want something smart\nI\u2019d have hoped for some app support at this price point, but the HP10 has no smart features, sadly.\nYou want a purifier that\u2019ll react to VOCs\nThe purifying element of the HP10 works well, but the auto mode\u2019s detection and reaction skills are basic, as it\u2019s only capable of detecting PM2.5 and PM10.\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nIt\u2019s no secret that Dyson appliances tend to come with a premium price tag, but you could be getting better appliances for less if you buy them separately.\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 review: Also consider\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 | Dyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09 | Dyson Purifier Cool Gen1 TP10 |\n|---|---|---|---|\nType | Purifying fan heater | Purifying tower fan | Purifying tower fan |\nPrice | $529.99 / \u00a3549.99 / AU$899 | $749.99 / \u00a3549.99 / AU$999 | $429.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$799 |\nFan speeds | 10 | 10 | 10 |\nAdditional modes | Auto, Night mode | Auto, Night mode, Diffused mode | Auto, Night mode |\nOscillation | Up to 350 degrees | Up to 350 degrees | Up to 350 degrees |\nFilter | HEPA H13 and activated carbon | HEPA H13 and activated carbon | HEPA H13 and activated carbon |\nApp support | No | Yes | No |\nDimensions | 9.8 x 9.8 x 30.2 inches / 25 x 25 x 77cm | 8.7 x 8.7 x 41 inches / 22 x 22 x 105cm | 8.7 x 8.7 x 41.3 inches / 22 x 22 x 105cm |\nWeight | 11.7 lbs / 5.3kg | 10.7 lbs / 4.85kg | 10.4 lbs / 4.7kg |\nDyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09\nThanks to its smart skills and great performance, I loved the Dyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09 when I reviewed it. At the time of writing, you can get the TP09 for a similar price, or even less, than the HP10, so if you\u2019re not too bothered about a heater, or have the space for a separate one, I\u2019d highly recommend checking out this alternative.\nDyson Purifier Cool Gen1 TP10\nIf you\u2019ve got your heart set on a Dyson purifying fan and don\u2019t want all the bells and whistles, then the Dyson Purifier Cool Gen1 TP10 is a great option. Other than the heating element, it\u2019s basically just a larger version of the HP10, and costs $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$100 less, giving you plenty of spare cash for a separate fan heater, if you want one. If you\u2019d like to learn more, I recommend checking out my full Dyson Purifier Cool Gen1 TP10 review.\nHow I tested the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10\n- I used the Dyson HP10 purifying fan heater in my living room and bedroom\n- I observed its detection and purification skills\n- I evaluated the strength of the airflow and the sound levels\nI used the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10 purifying fan heater in our photo studio, my living room, and my bedroom for two weeks. I evaluated how easy it was to operate, along with the build quality and aesthetics, and explored the available functions and features.\nI tested the strength of the airflow by determining at what distance I could still feel a cooling breeze. I also observed the HP10 purifying fan heater\u2019s detection and purification skills during standardized testing, which included spraying dry shampoo towards it from around two feet away to test how quickly it would react and clear the contamination, and I also used it passively in my bedroom and my living room.\nI used a decibel meter app on my iPhone to record the noise levels, taking readings from around two feet away and ensuring the fan wasn\u2019t blowing directly into the microphone.\nI checked the timer worked as expected, and tested out the sleep mode to see whether the HP10 was quiet enough for me to be able to sleep well with it running overnight.\n- First reviewed: August 2025\n- Read TechRadar's Reviews Guarantee\nCesci is a Reviews Staff Writer for TechRadar.

      "text": "Dyson just released the vacuum we actually wanted \u2013 an upgraded V8 that costs basically the same as the original\nThe new V8 Cyclone won't make your wallet run away and hide\n- The Dyson V8 Cyclone is an upgraded version of the best-selling V8 stick vac\n- Offers 30% more suction and 50% longer runtime than the original V8\n- In the UK, pricing is roughly the same as the original, too: \u00a3349.99 (US pricing TBC)\nDyson just launched a brand new flagship vacuum. It looks great, and has tons of cool and useful features. But realistically, I don't think it's the vacuum that most of us have been waiting for, because it comes with an absurd price tag.\nIn shock 'reading the room' news, this round of launches sees Dyson innovating not just at the top end of its range, but at the bottom end, where the normal people shop. Behold: the V8 Cyclone \u2013 an upgraded V8 stick vacuum with 30% more suction and 50% longer runtime, but (crucially) pretty much the same price tag.\nDespite having launched waaaay back in 2016, the V8 remains Dyson's best-selling vacuum. But because it's nearly a decade old, its specs are pretty shoddy compared to what you'd get with the best cordless vacuums on the market, making it hard to recommend to anyone other than die-hard Dyson fans on a budget. (The V8 has actually had a refresh before, in the form of the V8 Advanced, which offered slightly more suction than the original, but never entirely replaced the less-powerful model in the Dyson lineup.)\nThe V8 Cyclone addresses many of the V8's shortcomings, making it a genuinely strong, affordable option \u2013 something the brand's vacuum range has been sorely missing. It lacks the fancy features of the best Dyson vacuums, but prioritizes the important bits and, based on my hands-on time with it, is still an extremely capable cleaner.\nThe Dyson V8 Cyclone is capable of a maximum of 150 air watts of suction, compared to 115AW on the original V8. The main floorhead has been upgraded to one that actively detangles hair, so you don't end up having to manually de-fuzz it after every use.\nThe battery has had a boost and can now last up to a full hour on a single charge, which is in line with what you get with many modern cordless vacs. I'm also pleased to see that the battery is now removable, meaning you'll be able to replace it if it starts to wear out, or even buy a backup to hot-swap if you want longer cleaning sessions.\nI'm even more pleased to see what the V8 Cyclone does away with one of my biggest bug-bears with Dyson vacs: the trigger operation. Because the trigger operation is predominantly to extend runtimes, and that's not so much of an issue with the new, updated battery, the V8 Cyclone switches on and off with a one-press button.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn that way, it's actually superior to the likes of the far pricier, otherwise much more advanced V15 Detect. It's also much lighter than Dyson's newer vacuums, and more comfortable to use for long periods and in handheld mode. I'm less bowled over with the new 'scummy pond' (not the official name) color scheme, but you can't have everything.\nWhat are you missing?\nAside from the color scheme, there are a few more compromises you'll make for the lower price. There's no Auto mode where the suction intelligently ramps up and down depending on things like floor type or dirt detected.\nThe V8 Cyclone is also not as powerful as newer models \u2013 it has 150AW of suction, compared to 200AW on the V11 (the model up) and 315AW on the all-new, range-topping V16 Piston Animal. However, it seemed plenty sucky during my hands-on time with it (I'll report back more definitively once I've had a chance to do some proper, real-world testing).\nPart of that is to do with the fact the configuration. Here, the dust cup, motor and cyclones are at a right angle to the wand, whereas with all the new Dyson stick vacuums they're in a line. I asked Dyson Engineer Steph Parker why they decided not to introduce the in-line design with this upgrade, and she explained that it was just too big a change.\n\"If you change the format, you change a huge amount of product,\" she explained. \"If you think about where the filter is put on the product, and how your airflow goes through the product\u2026.\" She also told me that the V8 Cyclone is designed to be an all-rounder vacuum, but more geared towards smaller homes with less foot traffic.\nPrice & availability\nIn the UK, the Dyson V8 Cyclone will be available from 17 September 2025, at a list price of \u00a3349.99 \u2013 only slightly more than the V8 Advanced, at \u00a3329.99. I've requested pricing and launch info for the US and Australia, and will update this article when I hear back.\nYou might also like...\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "There's finally a new flagship Dyson, and it solves all my biggest problems with stick vacuums\nHere are the upgrades I think other brands will be scrabbling to copy\n- New flagship Dyson stick vac has been announced: the V16 Piston Animal\n- Boasts onboard dust compaction, hands-free attachment swapping, and advanced automation features\n- There's also a Submarine version with added mopping floorhead\nAfter three years of waiting, there's a new flagship Dyson stick vacuum in town: the Dyson V16 Piston Animal. Dyson's signature hi-tech flourishes are present and correct, but I'm excited to see some simpler, and perhaps more genuinely useful, usability improvements here too \u2013 including plenty of features I predict we'll be seeing copycat versions of from rival brands over the coming year.\nThe V16 Piston Animal could well be the best Dyson vacuum based on specs alone. It follows the Dyson Gen5detect (launched in 2022) in the flagship line, but in some ways it's more similar to 2021's Dyson V15 Detect. I had a chance to go hands-on with the new arrival at a recent event, and I was impressed \u2013 I'm in the process of testing it out properly, so sit tight for a full review.\nSo what's new? First up, the reason for the 'Piston' in the name: onboard dust compaction via a 'CleanCompaktor' bin. Push the red lever on the dust cup and you can squish the air out of everything that's been sucked up, meaning you can fit far more in the bin, and clean for longer without having to make repeated trips to the trash.\nThe inside of the bin has been redesigned so there are no crevices for dust to get caught in, and the slider also wipes down the inside of the casing to remove any fine dust that has collected there \u2013 which I am told has performance benefits as well as aesthetic ones.\nA second handy usability enhancement is that the V16 Piston has been designed so you can swap attachments without having to bend down. Press down on the red cuff at the top of the wand to release the floorhead, then simply slot a new one into place \u2013 the docking tube on the cleaner heads sits at an angle that enables you to do this easily while you're standing upright.\nIn practice this is a nifty bit of engineering and works a treat. I hope it's something other brands will start to adopt going forwards.\nTangle busters\nOn the subject of floorheads, the main one here looks rather different to what we're all used to. Rather than a single brushroll, the V16 Piston has two cone-shaped rollers. This 'All Floor Cones Sense' floorhead is based on the existing Hair screw tool, and like that attachment, it's meant to prevent hair getting tangled around the rollers. The idea is that the long hair is directed down to the small end of each cone, where it's sucked up into the intake tube.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDuring my hands-on time, I found this worked well when tackling hair that had been laid out in front of the cleaner head, but tangled strands tended to get stuck in the gap behind the roller, requiring manual unclogging. As a long-haired person, I'm interested to see how well it works in a real-world (rather than demo lab) environment \u2013 I'll report back once I've had a chance to put this feature through its paces properly.\nIncidentally, the Hair screw tool has also had an upgrade for the new model. A rubber scraper has been added to help dislodge hair from upholstery, so it's loose and ready to be sucked up.\nThere's no separate, hard floor-specific Fluffy floorhead here. Instead, Dyson has merged the two previous floorhead designs to create something that is apparently equally great on hard floors as on carpet. The All Floor Cones Sense floorhead features two rolls of bristles, cut slightly short so they'll agitate the fibers on a carpet but won't scratch a hard floor, plus a some fluffy material that's designed to sweep hard flooring.\nDyson has also ported over the laser from the Fluffy floorhead. Here it's placed in the middle of the head and low down at an angle, for even better dirt-illuminating benefits. Cleverly, you can activate an 'Auto' mode for the laser so it only comes on when the vacuum senses it's on a hard surface, or you can turn it off entirely, for example if you have pets that don't react well to lasers in the lounge.\nIf you have only hard floors, you might be better off opting for the Dyson PencilVac and its soft floorhead anyway. Another new launch, the PencilVac is a lightweight and lower-powered vacuum that's geared towards use on hard floors.\nPowering up\nIt almost goes without saying, but there has also been a power boost. The V16 Piston tops out at 315AW, compared to 262AW on the Gen5detect. Dyson has achieved this by flipping the motor 180-degrees compared to previous models, which sounds counter-intuitive but apparently works.\nMany of today's best cordless vacuums offer some kind of automatic suction adjustment, but here's a particularly advanced version. Like the Gen5detect and V15 Detect, the V16 can boost or lower suction depending on how much dirt it detects, but it can also intelligently adjust the brushroll speed to suit the kind of floor it's on. So for carpets, it'll use a high flow rate and fast roller speed, whereas on hard floors the roller speed is lower because it's not necessary for efficient dust pickup.\nIn Eco and Auto mode, half of the cyclones will switch off via a rubber muscle, to help extend filter life. In Boost mode, everything opens up to unleash maximum power.\nI'm pleased to see that said power boost isn't accompanied by an increase in weight \u2013 my main complaint with the Gen5detect is that it's just too heavy for a cordless stick vacuum. The V16 Piston is actually lighter; it weighs the same as the V15 Detect. In practice, it's still a little weighty, but it's reassuring that things are moving in the right direction.\nLike the V15 Detect, the V16 also comes in a Submarine version, which bundles in a mopping floorhead. While the Submarine Floorhead has been tweaked slightly compared to the one that accompanied the V15s Detect Submarine, it looks like our main issues with that floorhead (leaky dirty water compartment, too-small water tanks) haven't been addressed \u2013 again, I'll report back once I've had time to try it out properly.\nThis is also Dyson's first properly app-connected vacuum. The app will provide additional information and lots of fine-tuning control options. It also has a feature that logs cleaning sessions and how long it was used for. However, Dyson is at pains to point out that you can still use the V16 without the app if you want.\nPrice & availability\nIn the UK the Dyson V16 Piston Animal has a list price of \u00a3749.99, while the Submarine version costs \u00a3899.99. Both are available to buy from today at Dyson.co.uk.\nI'm awaiting confirmation of pricing and launch dates in the US and Australia and will update this article as soon as I hear more. In the UK, the pricing is roughly the same as the Gen5detect \u2013 if that holds true in other territories, expect it to cost around $950 / AU$1,550.\nYou might also like...\n- Dyson just made the world's slimmest vacuum cleaner \u2013 and after trying it out, I can never go back to a regular stick vac\n- Dyson's next-gen Airwrap is smaller, lighter, and more powerful, but it's the new straightening attachment that really turned my head\n- Dyson just released the vacuum we actually wanted \u2013 an upgraded V8 that costs basically the same as the original\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

  "argos_summary": "Dyson\u2019s new HushJet Purifier Compact is its first desktop air purifier, featuring a star\u2011shaped nozzle inspired by jet engines that compresses air for efficient entrainment while keeping the unit compact. The design reduces turbulence, making it exceptionally quiet, and it uses an electrostatic HEPA filter that can last up to five years. However, the device is still relatively large for a desk unit, with a 23cm diameter, and is not expected to hit the market until early 2026. Overall, the HushJet offers advanced filtration and quiet operation, but falls short on true desktop portability.",
