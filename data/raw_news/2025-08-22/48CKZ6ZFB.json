  "description": "Five years removed from a 1,000-yard season with the Panthers, Robbie Chosen is pushing for a spot on the 49ers' depleted WR depth chart.",
  "content": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 Having an up-to-date roster is a daily requirement at San Francisco 49ers practice, with all the receivers coming and going through the swivel doors from the practice field to the trainer\u2019s room.\n\nWait, who was that, gliding down the field and catching a pass from Brock Purdy on Thursday? An undrafted rookie? Some random vet looking for another shot at glory?\n\nTurns out it\u2019s both, if you listen to Robbie Chosen, formerly Robby Anderson and Robbie Anderson. He once went undrafted despite running a 4.36 40-yard dash in 2016. Now, 380 NFL catches later, Chosen is a born-again rookie, and he can still go.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a true burner,\u201d receiver Ricky Pearsall said after practice Thursday. \u201cHe still has speed to this day.\u201d\n\nChosen, 32, has a chance to crack the 49ers\u2019 53-man roster, thanks to a depleted receiver room, a new mindset and having a long-lost fan in 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan. The last wide receiver spot is one of roughly seven position battles on the docket for Saturday night\u2019s preseason finale against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nChosen never considered retirement last year when the Miami Dolphins let him go after he had one catch for 5 yards in two games. He spent two weeks at training camp with the 49ers before that, but both Chosen and Shanahan say the 10th-year vet is much better this time around.\n\n\u201cJust the new mindset and just all the preparation I put in,\u201d Chosen said. \u201cLast year, being on the outside looking in, it made me get hungrier. I\u2019ve never been in a situation like that, so it made me create new dreams and see things from a new perspective.\n\n\u201cI look at it like I\u2019m undrafted again, but I have the veteran experience and mindset.\u201d\n\nChosen said he loved the game of football too much to walk away last year, \u201cso I just had to be patient.\u201d\n\nHe had five catches for 92 yards in last week\u2019s preseason game against the Raiders, and he was working with the first team Thursday because of injuries to Brandon Aiyuk (knee), Jauan Jennings (calf), Jacob Cowing (hamstring), Jordan Watkins (ankle) and Russell Gage (knee).\n\nDepending on who is back for the opener, Chosen would have to beat out at least Skyy Moore, who was acquired from the Chiefs on Wednesday, and seventh-round draft pick Junior Bergen for a roster spot.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s put some good things on tape over his career,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI think he\u2019s in better shape than he was last time he came. I think he\u2019s got a better understanding of the playbook than last time, and I think he\u2019s got a better opportunity.\u201d\n\nChosen said the 49ers tried to trade for him in 2019, then tried to sign him the next offseason when he became a free agent. But he chose the Carolina Panthers, where he put up a career-best 95 catches for 1,096 yards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a fan of coach Shanahan and what they do here,\u201d Chosen said. \u201cMy biggest goal of playing football in the NFL has been to be a champion. And I feel like I\u2019m in a great place to pursue that.\n\n\u201cJust being in an environment with so many guys that are the best at their position. They say you are the company you keep, and that\u2019s the company I\u2019m trying to be in.\u201d\n\nPearsall said Chosen has been passing on a lot of \u201cwords of wisdom\u201d to the younger receivers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been there, he\u2019s done it,\u201d Pearsall said.\n\nAnd he hopes to be Chosen to do it again when the cutdown deadline arrives on Tuesday.\n\nWe\u2019re assuming left guard Ben Bartch (elbow) will return to practice soon. The bigger concern is at right guard, where Dominick Puni (knee) is iffy for Week 1 in Seattle. Since Puni suffered his injury, rising seventh-round rookie Connor Colby has been lining up at right guard with the first-team unit, while Nick Zakelj has been on the left. The 49ers know what they have in Zakelj, a 2022 draft pick. They want to see more of Colby to determine whether he could start his first NFL game in one of the league\u2019s loudest venues at Seattle.\n\nJason Pinnock (heel) began easing back into practice this week. He seems to have a good grip on one of the starting roles. The other boils down to incumbent Ji\u2019Ayir Brown or fifth-round rookie Marques Sigle. Brown is the safer choice given that he\u2019s played in 32 games (18 starts) over the past two seasons. Sigle, however, is more exciting. He\u2019s the fastest member of the secondary and so far has been a strong tackler, including an open-field stop Saturday on running back Raheem Mostert. Will another good outing put the rookie into the starting lineup?\n\nThe 49ers\u2019 first two linebacker spots will go to Fred Warner and Dee Winters. As of now, free-agent addition Luke Gifford has been the first choice at strongside linebacker and has looked good in that role. But can he hold off rookie Nick Martin, a third-round pick who made a big leap between the first and second preseason games? The 49ers will face the run-heavy Seahawks in Week 1, so the choice at strongside linebacker is a big one.\n\nWho makes the initial 53-man squad: last year\u2019s standout undrafted defensive tackle, Evan Anderson, or this year\u2019s standout undrafted rookie, Sebastian Valdez? Veterans Jordan Elliott and Kalia Davis, as well as rookies CJ West and Alfred Collins, seem like shoe-ins for roster spots. The 49ers would love to be able to keep Valdez or Anderson on the practice squad, but exposing them to waivers might mean another team snaps them up.\n\nThe first four spots seem like they\u2019ll go to Deommodore Lenoir, Renardo Green, Upton Stout and Dallis Flowers. The fifth? It\u2019s a battle between preseason star Chase Lucas and undrafted Jakob Robinson, who\u2019s been consistently sticky in coverage in training camp. The 49ers have been using Lucas, heretofore a nickel cornerback, on the outside this week and Robinson, mainly an outside cornerback, on the inside. That\u2019s where they\u2019ll likely play in Saturday\u2019s finale as well.\n\nThe 49ers are intrigued by Carter Bradley\u2019s live arm, but there\u2019s been too much arm in recent practices, with several deep balls and crossing-route throws going well beyond the target. Nate Sudfeld is not nearly as flashy, but he is the safer option. Either way, the team\u2019s No. 3 passer this season will likely land on the practice squad.\n\nThe competition is too close to call between Brayden Willis and Jake Tonges, who had a nice outing in Las Vegas. Both are versatile, move well and are reliable receivers. The 49ers could make this question moot and keep four tight ends: George Kittle, Luke Farrell, Tonges and Willis. Last year, however, they entered the season with three: Kittle, Tonges and Eric Saubert.",

      "text": "Even before he was the \u201cHulk,\u201d San Francisco 49ers rookie defensive tackle Sebastian Valdez was getting coaches\u2019 attention.\n\u201cThe very first time I ever saw the kid, he was probably 235 pounds,\u201d Montana State defensive coordinator Shawn Howe said in a telephone interview. \u201cI just watched him do a couple drills, and I said, \u2018That\u2019s the future of the three-tech position here at Montana State.\u2019\u201d\nValdez already had the frame, twitchiness and tenacity. Now, 66 pounds of muscle later, he has a real shot of cracking the 49ers\u2019 53-man roster.\nValdez smiled when he heard the Niners\u2019 veteran offensive linemen call him \u201cHulk.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time he has heard the nickname as he has tried to push himself to the NFL. The 6-foot-3, 301-pounder was undrafted out of Washington \u2014 after making a tough decision to transfer from Montana State \u2014 but has turned some pretty important heads.\nAdvertisement\nCoach Kyle Shanahan said Valdez was the player who \u201cflashed the most\u201d in Saturday\u2019s preseason opener against the Denver Broncos. \u201cHe\u2019s been flashing a lot in practice,\u201d Shanahan added. \u201cHe\u2019s been a problem in one-on-ones, and it looked like he played the run well today.\n\u201cWhen our (offensive line) coach talks about him in practice, that means he\u2019s doing some stuff, and it was good to see it carry over to the game today.\u201d\nFlashes from the rookie \u26a1\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/0iQ1iDePb9\n\u2014 San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) August 10, 2025\nThe block of granite had half a sack and a tackle for loss against the Broncos and, just like in college, opened up things for his teammates.\n\u201cIt was a good time \u2026 it was super fun,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t nervous at all. I am just going out there trying to execute to the best of my ability and do what I\u2019m told.\u201d\nSmash. Hulk, smash.\nValdez benched pressed 225 pounds 34 times at his pro day at Washington. Now, he is stacking up good days at training camp.\n\u201cWhen he gets opportunities against the first(-team) O-line \u2026 as he keeps proving that he\u2019s better than what he\u2019s going against, he\u2019ll get chances to go against better competition,\u201d defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said after practice Tuesday. \u201cFrom there, if he continues, then he\u2019ll continue his rise. He still has a lot of time to prove that he can make it.\u201d\nValdez had his choice of teams as an undrafted free agent, and he thought the 49ers and Saleh were the best fit.\n\u201cI think the scheme fit me the best,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 49ers are known to be a very dominant front, and when you look at tape from them, you want to be part of that team, and you want to be a part of that scheme.\u201d\nThe 49ers have had some injuries on the defensive line, which has opened the door for Valdez \u2014 just like it did at Montana State. He had started hitting the weight room hard at Monte Vista High near San Diego, and was a strong 235 pounds when Howe first noticed him. The plan was for Valdez to build his weight up gradually, but Valdez was forced to play because of injuries in his first year in 2021.\nAdvertisement\nAfter that, there was no stopping him.\n\u2018\u201cHe would eat, go work out, then go eat and then come back, and you\u2019d see him in there rolling out his whole body, stretching, stretching with bands,\u201d Howe said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just get bigger. He got faster, twitchier, more flexible.\u201d\nMontana State used a \u201ccheetah\u201d package, designed for four defensive ends, on passing downs \u2026 but Valdez never came off the field.\n\u201cEvery week, I would walk across the field, and somebody would shake my hand and say, \u2018We just can\u2019t block 95,\u2019\u201d Howe said.\nThough he didn\u2019t have huge stats \u2014 12 sacks total from 2021-23, Valdez helped the Bobcats lead the FCS in sacks in 2023.\n\u201cI figured then that I could really be a special player, and props to my college coach, Sean Howe, for really believing me and crafting me into the player that I am,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cThere have been moments of doubt, and my first day here with the 49ers was a little overwhelming.\n\u201cBut I know I can overcome anything, and I know I\u2019m an NFL player at heart.\u201d\nHowe knew it as well. He called Valdez after the Broncos game to tell him how proud he was. The two remain close even after Valdez transferred to Washington for a chance to get back to the West Coast (not to mention a wad of cash and a car).\n\u201cIt was brutal,\u201d Howe said of Valdez transferring. \u201cIt was tough because he\u2019s so loved by his teammates and coaches, right? And we developed this dude. He was our guy.\n\u201cBut he has such great character. He told me he was just going to look at the one school and ignored the other big schools who were offering more money. \u2026 I just think the way he dealt with the process was very, very mature and very well thought out.\u201d\nBefore he left, Valdez made Howe a promise: That he would give Howe his NFL jersey one day \u2014 just like he had seen current Chicago Bears linebacker Daniel Hardy once do.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m working my butt off, and as soon as I make this team, I\u2019ll have a jersey coming his way to put on his wall,\u201d Valdez said.\nMatt Barrow\u2019s odds and ends from Tuesday\u2019s practice\n\u2022 Left guard Ben Bartch appeared to injure his right arm on a running play early in Tuesday\u2019s team period. He was replaced by seventh-round rookie Connor Colby, who held up well in Saturday\u2019s game. Nick Zakelj practiced at right guard with the second-team unit and got some repetitions at center with the third team.\n\u2022 Receiver Jacob Cowing was back at practice, his first session since injuring his hamstring on the first day of training camp. Cowing also served as punt returner alongside rookie Junior Bergen. As far as receivers, Tuesday\u2019s standout was veteran Robbie Chosen, who caught two long passes from Mac Jones, including one for a would-be touchdown. George Kittle, meanwhile, caught two deep passes from Brock Purdy.\n\u2022 The highlight of the day: a touchdown catch by right guard Dominick Puni. It came during a red zone sequence in which Purdy\u2019s pass to Kyle Juszczyk was tipped in the air. Puni, who\u2019d been barrelling down the line of scrimmage, collected the ball and ran into the left side of the end zone, sparking a loud celebration from his fellow offensive linemen.\n\u2022 Nick Bosa had a rest day, highlighting the team\u2019s shortage of defensive ends. With Bosa, Mykel Williams (knee), Sam Okuayinonu (groin), Robert Beal Jr. (groin) and Yetur Gross-Matos (ankle) out, Bryce Huff and Jonathan Garvin got the lion\u2019s share of snaps at the position.\n\u2022 Rookie nickelback Upton Stout (calf) worked out on a side field. The 49ers are hoping he can take part in Thursday\u2019s joint practice with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\u2022 Jake Moody was 7 of 7 on field goal attempts Tuesday, with the last two from 50 yards or longer.\n(Photo: David Gonzales / Imagn Images)"

      "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 The San Francisco 49ers raced out to a 9-0 lead against the Denver Broncos on Saturday night, notable because it was quarterback Mac Jones and a slew of second-stringers on offense and defense versus the Broncos\u2019 starters in the first quarter.\nAfter that, the game dissolved into, well, a typical preseason opener. Which is to say, it was full of penalties (20 total), mistakes and missed tackles, most of them by 49ers backups who lost the early momentum and fell 30-9.\nAdvertisement\nStill, there were some promising performances, including by several rookies. Here were the top three standouts, followed by three players who fell flat in the summer opener.\nThree up\nNCB Chase Lucas\nLucas got two of the 49ers\u2019 nine points when he blitzed out of the slot and forced Broncos quarterback Bo Nix into an intentional grounding penalty in the end zone. Defenses don\u2019t always reveal their blitzes in the preseason, but defensive coordinator Robert Saleh told Lucas before the game that he\u2019d be aggressive with his calls.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna let it rip,\u2019\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI said, \u2018Man, if you\u2019re gonna let rip, I\u2019m going to show you some things.\u2019 He stuck to his word, and it ended up going in our favor.\u201d\nSafety! @49ers add two points to their lead\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/1nNFaGuQVq\n\u2014 NFL (@NFL) August 10, 2025\nLucas got the nod at nickel cornerback because promising rookie Upton Stout is dealing with calf tightness, and the 49ers decided to be cautious with him.\nLucas, who spent 2024 on San Francisco\u2019s practice squad, also had a nice third-down pass breakup on a would-be touchdown toss late in the first quarter. But what will really jump out to coaches was his stout tackle on 227-pound running back Audric Estime on the first play of the third quarter and another big hit later in the quarter. Lucas led all defenders with eight tackles, five of them solo stops.\nDT Kalia Davis\nWho starts at defensive tackle on Sept. 7 in Seattle? Davis made a strong case Saturday, finishing with a sack, a quarterback hit and a splash play in run defense in which he barreled down the line of scrimmage to snag speedy Broncos tailback Jaleel McLaughlin by the ankles. Davis, who started next to rookie C.J. West, led all 49ers linemen with three solo tackles.\n\u201cI thought he had a really good offseason last year and was having a good training camp, but then got hurt (in the preseason) at Tennessee pretty bad,\u201d Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cAnd it set him back a ways. But I think this offseason has been very similar. He\u2019s had a real good training camp, and I thought he had a good first half (Saturday), too.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nS Marques Sigle\nSigle was one of three rookies \u2014 West and receiver Jordan Watkins were the others \u2014 who started the game. Though he left late in the second quarter with a knee injury, he was active and involved early, leading San Francisco with seven tackles in the first half.\nShanahan said the preliminary indication was that Sigle suffered a knee bruise and nothing more serious.\n\u201cI thought he was one of the guys who flashed tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cHe got a little bit of a late start by being injured in the (spring). And it was a few days into camp until he really got going. But he\u2019s had a hell of a week here and finished it off good today.\u201d\nOne of the 49ers\u2019 Week 1 safety spots seems like it will go to Jason Pinnock. The other is up for grabs. One contender, Ji\u2019Ayir Brown, has been out with a lingering ankle issue, while another, Richie Grant, will miss roughly a week with a knee injury. Sigle, meanwhile, is the 49ers\u2019 fastest safety since Tarvarius Moore (third round, 2018), and that speed was apparent Saturday as he buzzed around the field. One of the questions with him is whether, at 6 feet, 199 pounds, he has the size to hold up at the position.\nHonorable mentions\nWR Junior Bergen: He was the top choice at kick and punt returner, taking back his first punt for 28 yards. It was a promising start for a rookie whose roster spot hinges on how well he returns punts.\nWR Jordan Watkins: He had a mixed outing, including running the wrong route on Jones\u2019 first-quarter interception. However, he also connected with Jones on a 50-yard pass that led to an opening-drive score. The play highlighted Watkins\u2019 strength: He\u2019s dangerous on deep balls.\nBig play from Jordan Watkins \ud83d\ude24\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/bMZF3strPi\n\u2014 NFL (@NFL) August 10, 2025\nDT Sebastian Valdez: The undrafted rookie has been turning heads in practice and looked good Saturday, too. He finished with four tackles, including a sack he shared with defensive end Robert Beal Jr.\nThree down\nQB Carter Bradley\nIn the second quarter, Bradley stared down receiver Russell Gage, leading Broncos linebacker Karene Reid to an easy interception. And that was just one of his miscues. He also had:\n- an intentional grounding penalty\n- a ball batted at the line of scrimmage\n- a delay-of-game penalty\n- a second interception that was erased by an unrelated Denver penalty\nBradley, the son of assistant head coach Gus Bradley, gave way to Tanner Mordecai having completed 6 of 14 passes for 32 yards and a 20.5 passer rating. Even his longest connection of the game, a 19-yarder to tight end Jake Tonges, was so underthrown that Broncos head coach Sean Payton challenged the completion.\nAdvertisement\nLB Nick Martin\nMartin looked a little like fellow weakside linebacker Dee Winters did in previous preseasons: His speed and athleticism were evident, but he was a bit all over the place and had three missed tackles on one series alone in the third quarter.\nWinters, who seems to have a lock on the weakside spot this year, started the game, giving way to Martin late in the first quarter.\n\u201cHe ran around, got a lot of playing time,\u201d Shanahan said of Martin. \u201cHe had a couple of misses, especially on a big third down on a shallow cross across the field. (He) got his eyes a little too nosy with the running back. I like how Nick\u2019s been going, but I think there\u2019s a lot (on Saturday\u2019s) tape he can get better from.\u201d\nT Spencer Burford\nBurford had trouble with speed rusher Nik Bonitto on back-to-back plays in the first quarter. Bonitto simply ran past Burford on second down, leading to a 1-yard sack of Jones. He did the same thing on third-and-long, resulting in a quarterback hit and a throwaway incompletion.\nShanahan said there were extenuating circumstances on both plays. On one, Bonitto was able to jump the snap because the 49ers were on a quick count. On the other, Burford was expecting someone to chip Bonitto on the outside, but that player missed the assignment.\nStill, the sequence seemed to highlight the 49ers\u2019 depth issues behind starting tackles Trent Williams and Colton McKivitz. Until Andre Dillard returns from offseason ankle surgery, Burford is the top backup for Williams, who hasn\u2019t played a full season since 2013.\nHonorable mentions\nQB Tanner Mordecai: He didn\u2019t fare any better than Bradley, completing 3 of 6 passes and also throwing an interception. His quarterback rating: 18.8.\nCB Tre Brown: He was the top nickel back in the spring. On Sunday, he played with the third-team defense, working opposite undrafted rookie Jakob Robinson, though he did force a fumble.\nAdvertisement\nVirtual review: The officials used the new measurement technology in the first quarter to determine whether the Broncos had picked up a first down. Two issues: 1. Anyone with working eyeballs could tell they were a couple of feet short. 2. The process took at least as long as the old-fashioned chain gang would have.\n(Photo of Chase Lucas, No. 26: Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez / Associated Press)"

      "text": "It\u2019s easy to know what Robert Saleh saw the first time he clicked on the film of rookie linebacker Nick Martin.\n\u201cSpeed and tremendous violence,\u201d the San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator said after practice Wednesday.\nMartin was a lot better in the Niners\u2019 second preseason game Saturday against the Las Vegas Raiders than he was in the opener, and one could see the other reasons why the 49ers are high on him. Martin overran a couple of tackles again, but he demonstrated some elite processing skills and made a handful of big plays, finishing with a sack, a pass breakup and six tackles (two for a loss of yardage).\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think it was just calming down a little bit,\u201d Martin said of the improvement. \u201c(In the opener) I got a little too amped up trying to make everything be a kill shot. Even (Saturday), I had a couple, but definitely made some improvements.\u201d\nMartin said he talked to linebacker Fred Warner, coaches, family members and God last week, and they all had the same advice: Stay where your feet are, and don\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\nThe 5-foot-11, 221-pound Martin had a big hit on Raiders receiver Shedrick Jackson and later blew up a swing pass, but it was a sack and a breakup of a deep pass to tight end Carter Runyon that especially showed his ability to read and attack.\n\u201cNick\u2019s got all the talent in the world,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cHis reactionary skills are incredible. The game\u2019s got to slow down for him. And that\u2019s reps. But what was encouraging is that he maintained his confidence. He came out last week, had a very productive day, and the expectation for him is to continue to get better.\u201d\nEspecially when you consider it was only Martin\u2019s second game in almost 11 months, after a knee injury limited him to five games at Oklahoma State last season.\nMartin had six sacks in 14 games for the Cowboys in 2023, and he set up the Raiders pretty well on his first one for the 49ers, as quarterback Aidan O\u2019Connell never had a chance to escape.\n.@49ers third-round pick Nick Martin gets himself a sack \ud83d\udcaa\nWatch on @NFLNetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/hSV8bP7Eqf\u2014 NFL (@NFL) August 16, 2025\n\u201cI stemmed up a little bit to try to get them to slide the protection to the left, and it worked,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe center didn\u2019t see me come, and he saw me late, and I was able to get a rip on him, so I got through.\n\u201cI love rushing \u2014 I did a lot of it in college, and I\u2019m just glad that it\u2019s able to translate. When I hear my number called, I\u2019ve got to make the most of it.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nLater, Martin showed off the burst again when he reacted to Runyon\u2019s route and made a play on the ball, clawing it out of the tight end\u2019s hands.\n\u201cI saw him run a straight seam,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI thought he was gonna bow out a little bit. I thought I was gonna have a little time, but now he went straight. So I knew I had to catch up and just play through the hands.\n\u201cIt was just an opportunity, and I made the most of it.\u201d\nMartin credits Saleh\u2019s patience with him this training camp.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a calm guy, but he has that intensity about him,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI\u2019m just excited and super blessed to be coached by him. This system is definitely for me, and I love it.\u201d\nMartin was drafted in the third round, seemingly to replace Dee Greenlaw alongside Warner, but Dee Winters has turned in an impressive offseason and training camp \u2014 even covering Christian McCaffrey one-on-one at times \u2014 to lock down the weakside spot.\nBut Martin could emerge as the third linebacker on running downs, and he could show up in other packages, too. He knows he is a good fit on Saleh\u2019s attacking defense. He knew it back when the 49ers drafted him, as coach Kyle Shanahan got on the phone and mentioned how the team had lost a big hitter in Greenlaw.\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Coach, I already know. I already know I can do that. Like, that\u2019s where I wanted to be,\u2019\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cHe knew all about us, and I think he was just as excited to come here as we are to have him.\u201d\nAnother WR bites the dust\nIt seems that not a day goes by without the 49ers losing a receiver. On Wednesday, it was veteran Russell Gage, who sustained a sprained MCL and will miss seven to 10 days, general manager John Lynch said on KNBR radio Thursday. Gage, who caught 72 passes for the Falcons in 2020 and thought his career might be over after a patellar tendon tear in 2023, had been one of the standouts at training camp.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe expect him to be ready for the opener,\u201d Lynch said.\nGage\u2019s injury came one day after Jacob Cowing tweaked a hamstring, joining receivers Brandon Aiyuk (knee), Jauan Jennings (calf) and rookie Jordan Watkins (ankle) on the sideline. Former Ram Demarcus Robinson is healthy \u2014 and has also had a strong camp \u2014 but is set to miss the first three games of the season due to a suspension stemming from a DUI arrest.\nThe 49ers traded a 2027 sixth-round pick to the Chiefs for fourth-year receiver Skyy Moore and a 2027 seventh-round pick on Wednesday. He might be starting soon if this keeps up.\n\u201cHe is a talented guy,\u201d Lynch said of Moore. \u201cProbably a change in environment was needed. \u2026 We really liked him during the draft process.\u201d\n(Photo of Nick Martin, 45, and Kalia Davis: Ian Maule / Getty Images)"

      "text": "By Matt Barrows, Jesse Newell, Dianna Russini and Vic Tafur\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are trading wide receiver Skyy Moore to the San Francisco 49ers, sending Moore and a 2027 seventh-round pick in exchange for a 2027 sixth-round pick, according to team and league sources.\nSource confirms the Chiefs are trading WR Skyy Moore to the 49ers.\n\u2014 Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) August 21, 2025\nA second-round pick (No. 54) by Kansas City in 2022, Moore had 43 receptions for 494 yards and one touchdown through two seasons, never establishing a full-time role on the Chiefs offense. He did not have a catch through six games in 2024 before suffering a season-ending core muscle injury in October.\nAdvertisement\nMoore, who turns 25 next month, also returned punts and kicks for the Chiefs, mostly in 2022. He dropped two passes in Friday\u2019s preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks before taking an 88-yard punt return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.\nWhy the Chiefs moved on\nMoore has battled confidence issues since fumbling a few punt returns in his rookie season, and he has been open about those mental hurdles, including after his return touchdown last week.\n\u201cIt felt great, just showing that sense of resiliency,\u201d Moore said after the game. \u201cObviously, I had two drops this game, and felt like I was just in my head after the first one. \u2026 (The return touchdown) meant a lot to me this game and a lot for my confidence. Just showing myself that if you keep going \u2026 you can\u2019t lose if you keep going.\n\u201cThe biggest thing is just stay out of my head. Just play ball.\u201d\nThe Chiefs feel good about the back end of their roster depth at receiver, with Nikko Remigio (return specialist) and Jason Brownlee (red zone, jump-ball weapon) now potentially fighting for a final spot at receiver.\nKansas City also had that position altered recently, with receiver Rashee Rice\u2019s disciplinary hearing scheduled for late September, meaning he could start the season before serving an expected NFL suspension. Behind him, the Chiefs have emerging second-year player Xavier Worthy, veterans Hollywood Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster and fourth-round rookie Jalen Royals.\nMoore also became expendable because of the recent rise of receiver Tyquan Thornton, who was taken four picks before Moore (50th) in 2022. The Chiefs added Thornton to their practice squad last season after he was released by the New England Patriots. And the reason New England got Thornton? The team executed a trade in the 2022 NFL Draft, moving up four spots to exchange picks with \u2026 Kansas City. Four selections later, the Chiefs put in their draft card to select Moore. \u2014 Jesse Newell, Chiefs beat writer\nAdvertisement\nWhy the 49ers needed WR help\nThe 49ers might not be finished bulking up their receiving corps. For one, Moore is young, isn\u2019t familiar with the Kyle Shanahan-style offense and probably isn\u2019t someone the team can depend on offensively early in the season. More than that, San Francisco is threadbare at the receiver spot and is desperate for bodies. Four of its top six players at the position \u2014 Brandon Aiyuk, Demarcus Robinson, Jordan Watkins and Jacob Cowing \u2014 might not be available for the Week 1 opener in Seattle, and another, Jauan Jennings, has been out of action with a calf issue since the second week of training camp.\nThe team also has veterans Russell Gage and Robbie Chosen on the roster, as well as rookie return specialist Junior Bergen. Still, the 49ers can be expected to scour the waiver wire next week for wideouts who are possibilities for the active roster and practice squad. \u2014 Matt Barrows, 49ers senior writer\nWhat Moore brings\nMoore, in his fourth season, was the Chiefs\u2019 longest-tenured receiver. His playing time has fallen off, but the 49ers are desperate because of injuries and apparently thought Moore\u2019s quickness and experience (36 games, 11 starts, 43 catches) outweighed some route-running roughness and a lack of contested catches.\nMoore can play in the slot or outside, and he showed his returning ability last week. Two of the 49ers\u2019 three possible returners, Watkins and Cowing, are injured. The other is Bergen, who is raw as a receiver and whose only ticket to making the roster was as an impact returner, so the trade for Moore is not a good sign for him. \u2014 Vic Tafur, 49ers senior writer\n(Photo: Mark J.
