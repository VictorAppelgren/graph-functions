  "title": "Google\u2019s best-ever 4K streamer is within $1 of its lowest price",
  "description": "Google\u2019s TV Streamer 4K doubles as a smart home hub with support for Matter.",
  "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find a gadget that can handle two totally separate tasks very well, but Google\u2019s TV Streamer 4K pulls it off. The 4K set top box allows you to stream your favorite TV shows and movies, and is also an impressive smart home hub, with support for Matter and a built-in Thread radio. It\u2019s currently on sale for $79.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, which is its lowest price since May, and a dollar shy of its lowest price to date.\n\nThe TV Streamer 4K is bigger than a streaming dongle like the Fire TV Stick, but won\u2019t take up much room on top of your TV stand. It has a gigabit ethernet port for wired networking and a HDMI 2.1 port to send a 4K 60Hz signal to your TV or projector. It supports multiple HDR (High Dynamic Range) and surround sound audio formats, including Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In our tests, the TV Streamer 4K took about 10 minutes to set up \u2014 including downloading and installing a software update \u2014 when using the Google Home app on a smartphone. The TV Streamer asks whether you\u2019d like to set up a child\u2019s profile during setup, which is helpful if you have kids.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer 4K runs on Android TV, which we found easy to navigate using buttons on the remote or our voice via the remote\u2019s built-in mic and Google Assistant. Google Assistant recognized our voice requests, and took us directly to the shows we wanted to watch (most of the time). Android TV has apps for every major streaming service, and popping in and out of them constantly can get tedious, which is why it\u2019s nice to have reliable on-board voice controls.\n\nIf you want a Google Home Hub to control your smart home gadgets, the TV Streamer 4K is a great choice. You can use it to connect smart lights, locks, and thermostats to Google Home, and once these devices are configured, you can control them from the TV Streamer 4K by using Google Assistant or navigating to a Home panel. It only took a few seconds to run a scene controlling multiple smart home devices simultaneously. If your TV\u2019s built-in streaming apps are feeling sluggish, or you want to expand your smart home into the living room, the Google TV Streamer 4K is a great choice \u2014 especially now that it\u2019s on sale.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

If you believe a user of the Services is infringing your copyright, please provide written notice to our agent listed below for notice of claims of copyright infringement.\nVox Media, LLC, 1701 Rhode Island Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036\nEmail: copyright@voxmedia.com\nYour written notice must: (a) contain your physical or electronic signature; (b) identify the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed; (c) identify the allegedly infringing material in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material; (d) contain adequate information by which we can contact you (including postal address, telephone number, and email address); (e) contain a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or the law; (f) contain a statement that the information in the written notice is accurate; and (g) contain a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. Please do not send notices or inquiries unrelated to alleged copyright infringement to our designated copyright agent.\nIf you believe that your trademark is being used somewhere on the Services in a way that constitutes trademark infringement, the owner or an agent of the owner may notify us at copyright@voxmedia.com. We ask that any complaints provide the accurate identity of the owner, how we may contact you, and the specific nature of the complaint.\nIf you believe in good faith that someone has wrongfully filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see www.loc.gov/copyright. Send counter-notices to the same addresses listed above and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider\u2019s address is located, or, if the content provider\u2019s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.\nIf a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company\u2019s discretion.\nIf the Sites receive more than one Notice of Copyright Infringement concerning a user, the user may be deemed a \u201crepeat copyright infringer.\u201d The Sites reserve the right to terminate the accounts of \u201crepeat copyright infringers.\u201d\nMaterial on our Sites may include inaccuracies or typographical errors.

We are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaching these Terms or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. However, you understand that to the extent permitted under applicable law, in no event will we or our officers, employees, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, subcontractors or licensors be liable under any theory of liability (whether in contract, tort, statutory, or otherwise) for any unforeseeable, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of revenues, profits, business, business interruption, business opportunity goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if such parties were advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your (or anyone using your account\u2019s) use of the Services. We will not be liable for damages which you could have avoided by following our advice, including to apply an update, patch or error correction offered to you free of charge or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us. We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or any delay in the performance of, any of our obligations under these Terms that is caused by any event or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including any failure of public or private telecommunications networks or any delays or latency due to your physical location or your wireless data service provider\u2019s network. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in no event shall our liability to you exceed the amount of fees you paid us (if applicable) for a period of three months prior to the date you submit a claim.\n-\nExclusions and Limitations\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.\n-\nIndemnification\nYou agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants, subcontractors and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your accounts) violation of these Terms. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: \u201cA general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\u201d\nArbitration Agreement\nPlease read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Vox Media, LLC, and any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, brands and entities that it controls, including Curbed, Eater, Grub Street, New York Magazine, Polygon, POPSUGAR, Recode, SB Nation, Select All, The Cut, The Daily Intelligencer, The Dodo, The Strategist, The Verge, Thrillist, Vox, Vulture, and other affiliated sites, properties, or applications (collectively \u201cVox Media,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. Both you and Vox Media acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Vox Media\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof. Any arbitrations filed after the date these terms go into effect must comply with these arbitration provisions.\nThe parties agree that this Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16.\nPre-Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Procedure\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Vox Media must be emailed to TOS.Disputes@voxmedia.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). A Notice to you by Vox Media must be sent to the email address associated with your Vox Media subscription or Membership, if applicable. Any Notice must include (i) the claimant's name, address, and email address; and (if different) the email address associated with the relevant Vox Media subscription or Membership; (ii) if you are submitting the Notice, how and when you became a member, your membership history, and current membership status; (iii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, including any relevant facts, and if you are submitting the Notice, facts pertaining to your use of Vox Media communities and sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice; and (vi) if you are the claimant and are represented by counsel, your signed statement authorizing Vox Media to disclose your Vox Media membership details to your attorney while seeking to resolve your claim. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person's dispute.\nAfter receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).\nCompliance with this section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures. All of the procedures are essential so that you and Vox Media have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of these procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these procedures in arbitration.\nArbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitrationThe arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by the NAM. (If the NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 5.) The NAM Rules are available online at https://namadr.com/ by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For all non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in Washington, DC, District of Columbia.\nYou and we agree as otherwise expressly provided herein and except as to the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution requirements referenced above and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement, applicability of the SOL, whether claim can or should be brought in small claims, whether a plaintiff or the company has complied with the pre-arbitration notice and negotiation requirements, or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration (including whether a dispute is subject to this Arbitration Agreement or a previous arbitration provision between you and Vox Media), which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.\nAt the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nThe arbitrator's decision is binding only between you and Vox Media and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator's award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.\nAs in court, you and Vox Media agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.\nExcept as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including the awards of attorneys' fees and costs in accordance with applicable law. You and we agree that dispositive motions shall be allowed in any arbitration if requested by either party.\nIn any arbitration between you and Vox Media, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party's favor and is less than the defending party's settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party's favor, the other party must pay the defending party's costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney's fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.\nCosts of Arbitration\nUnless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees.\nSmall Claims Court; Infringement\nEither you or Vox Media may elect to have any claim that qualifies for small claims court in the United States county where you live or work heard by such small claims court. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.\nWaiver of Jury Trial\nYOU AND VOX MEDIA WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Vox Media are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Vox Media over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND VOX MEDIA WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\nWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Vox Media is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth below.\nMass Filings Procedure\nIf, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM's Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements herein, until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Arbitrator selection for each batch or stage shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and shall be subject to any rights to strike an arbitrator provided under applicable state law if the rights granted by law exceed those provided for in the NAM rules, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.\nStage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 10 claims per side (20 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Vox Media shall pay the mediator's fee.\nStage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 20 claims per side (40 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Vox Media shall pay the mediator's fee.\nStage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge.\nIf your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:\nOption One: You and Vox Media may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have the claim heard in court consistent with the Agreement. You may opt out of arbitration by providing your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by sending Vox Media an email to TOS.Disputes@voxmedia.com. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage 3 or the elective mediation associated with Stage 3. Vox Media may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30 day opt out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.\nOR\nOption Two: If neither you nor Vox Media elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 200, then 200 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 200, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 200 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.\nA court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement.\nYou and Vox Media agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Vox Media acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.\nOpt-out\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Vox Media, LLC, 1701 Rhode Island Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms' arbitration agreement. Notices sent to any other address, or sent by electronic mail or communicated orally, will not be accepted or effective. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Vox also will not be bound by it.\nExclusive Venue\nIf you send the opt-out notice and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Vox Media to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then both you and Vox Media agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Washington, DC, District of Columbia, or the federal district in which that county falls.\n-\nTrademarks & Patents\n\u201cVox Media, LLC,\u201d the Vox Media design, our site names and logos, as well as certain other names, logos, and materials displayed in the Services constitute trademarks, trade names, service marks or logos (\u201cMarks\u201d) of us or other entities.

      "text": "Google Privacy Policy\nWhen you use our services, you\u2019re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nIf European Union or United Kingdom data protection law applies to the processing of your information, you can review the European requirements section below to learn more about your rights and Google\u2019s compliance with these laws.\nContents\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\n- Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\n- Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\n- Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\nInformation Google collects\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\nWhen you\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\nWhen you\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\nThings you create or provide to us\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\nInformation we collect as you use our services\nYour apps, browsers & devices\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\u2019re using your Android device.\nYour activity\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\n- Terms you search for\n- Videos you watch\n- Views and interactions with content and ads\n- Voice and audio information\n- Purchase activity\n- People with whom you communicate or share content\n- Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\n- Chrome browsing history you\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\u2019s saved in your account.\nYour location information\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\nDepending on the products you\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\n- IP address\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\u2019s location on or off using the device\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\nWhy Google collects data\nWe use data to build better services\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\nProvide our services\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\nMaintain & improve our services\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\nDevelop new services\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \u201cmountain bikes,\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\n- We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\n- We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\n- We don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \u201ctap to call\u201d button, we\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\nMeasure performance\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\nCommunicate with you\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\nWe\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\nYour privacy controls\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\nWhen you\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you\u2019ve saved with Google.\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\nPrivacy controls\nActivity Controls\nDecide what types of activity you\u2019d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\nAd settings\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\nAbout you\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\nShared endorsements\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\nSites and apps that use Google services\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\nWays to review & update your information\nMy Activity\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that\u2019s saved to your Google Account when you\u2019re signed in and using Google services, like searches you\u2019ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\nGoogle Dashboard\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\nYour personal information\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\nWhen you\u2019re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\nExporting, removing & deleting your information\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\nTo delete your information, you can:\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\n- Delete your entire Google Account\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you\u2019re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you\u2019re signed in to a Google Account, including:\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\nSharing your information\nWhen you share your information\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\nWhen you\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\nWhen Google shares your information\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\nWith your consent\nWe\u2019ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We\u2019ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\nWith domain administrators\nIf you\u2019re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\n- Change your account password\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\nFor external processing\nWe provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\u2019s audio recognition technologies.\nFor legal reasons\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\n- Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners \u2014 like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\nKeeping your information secure\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they\u2019ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).\nUnique identifiers\nA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.\nUnique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.\nOn other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device\u2019s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device\u2019s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.\nAdditional Context\nActivity on Google Services\nIf you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account\u2019s Web & App Activity.

We and our third-party service providers (including any third-party content, advertising, and analytics providers) automatically collect certain information from your device or web browser when you interact with the Services to help us understand how our users use the Services and to target advertising to you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as \u201cUsage Data\u201d). For example, each time you visit the Services we and our third-party service providers may automatically collect your location, IP address, mobile device identifier or other unique identifier, browser and computer type, Internet service provider used, clickstream information, access time, the Web page you came from, the URL you go to next, the Web page(s) that you access during your visit and your interaction with content or advertising on the Services. We may contract with third parties to collect this information on our behalf for analytics purposes.\nPurposes For This Information. We and our third-party service providers use such Usage Data for a variety of purposes including to diagnose problems with our servers and software, to administer the Services, to gather demographic information and to target advertising to you on the Services and elsewhere online. Accordingly, our third-party advertising networks and ad servers will also provide us with information, including reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked on the Services in a manner that does not identify personally any specific individual. The Usage Data we collect is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Data.\n-\nCookies/Tracking Technologies\nWe use tracking technologies, such as cookies, local storage, and pixel tags.\nCookies and Local Storage\nCookies and local storage may be set and accessed on your computer. Upon your first visit to the Services, a cookie or local storage will be sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. \u201cCookies\u201d and local storage are small files containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer\u2019s browser and stored on your device when you visit a website. Many major Web services use cookies to provide useful features for their users. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, if you reject cookies, you will not be able to sign in to the Services or take full advantage of our Services. Additionally, if you clear all cookies on your browser at any point after setting your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent, you will have to again reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nFor more information, please read our Cookie Policy.\nPixel Tags\nWe also use \u201cpixel tags,\u201d which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Services and collect Usage Data. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the device that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer.\nWe use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third-party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you. Pixel tags also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit the Services or other websites.\nLog Files\nA log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data. We collect log files and other usage information when you access, use and interact with the Services (even if you have not created an account or logged into your account on the Services), including IP address, date and time that you signed up for an account, language setting, browser type, operating system type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, page you requested, user agent, date and time stamps, clickstream data, and information about your search and click activity.\nDevice Fingerprinting\nDevice fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device\u2019s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps.\nApp Technologies, Customization, and Usage\nThere are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps that allow us to collect information about your installation, use, and updating of our apps as well as information about your device, including your unique mobile device identifier (\u201cUDID\u201d) and other technical identifiers. More specifically, these tracking technologies allow us to collect data about your device and your use of our apps, the pages, videos, other content, or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, and items you download. These tracking technologies are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us to track our conversions and communicate with you across devices, bring you advertising both on and off the Services, customize the app to your interests and preferences and link such across platforms and devices, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.\nLocation-Identifying Technologies\nGPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device\u2019s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.\nIn addition, we use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes essential to the operation of our sites and business.\nFor more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our Service, please review Section 13 of this Privacy Notice and our Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy. You can also find more information about cookies and how they work, what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them here and here.\n-\nInformation You Choose To Submit\nYou can visit the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as \u201cPersonal Data\u201d). If, however, you wish to register to become a member of the Services, you are required to provide certain Personal Data (for example, your name and email address), and you must also provide a username and password. We use your Personal Data to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our Services, to contact you from time to time about us and our products and services, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.\nWe refer collectively to all information we collect that is not Personal Data, including Usage Data, demographic data and de-identified Personal Data, as \u201cNon-Personal Data\u201d. If we combine Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal Data, Non-Personal Data, and User Submissions are referred to in this Privacy Policy collectively as \u201cUser Information.\u201d\nYou may choose to enter contests, sweepstakes, competitions, participate in surveys, subscribe to newsletters, comment articles, use message boards, chat rooms, reader photo upload areas, reader ratings and reviews, save articles or other content on our Services, reader-created content upload areas, contact us and customer support areas, and areas that allow you to register for SMS text messaging and mobile alerts, or otherwise interact with us in similar ways (\u201cInteractive Areas\u201d). These Interactive Areas may require that you provide Personal Data corresponding with the activities. You understand and agree that the Interactive Areas are voluntary and that your're providing Personal Data for those activities will be collected and used by us to identify and communicate with you. In certain circumstances, we may share that Personal Data with sponsors, advertisers, affiliates or other partners. When you take a quiz or survey or respond to a poll on the Services, in addition to recording your responses, we may record your IP address and/or other identifiers in order to provide an outcome (for quizzes), report and analyze your survey results, or record your vote as part of the final count (for polls). We may also use and disclose this information for advertising purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.\nIn addition, you are required to provide certain Personal Data when you submit a job application and supporting materials. You can also choose to submit or we may collect additional information about yourself, such as demographic information (for example your gender, birth date, or zip code) and information about your preferences and interests. Failure to provide any required Personal Data will prevent us from being able to provide the Services you request (e.g., member registration or submission of job application) or otherwise inhibit our ability to provide the Services.\nHere are examples of User Information we may collect:\n- Contact Data - your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.\n- Credentials - passwords, password hints, and other information for authentication and account access.\n- Demographic Data - demographic information including your age, gender, and country.\n- Payment Data - data necessary to process your payment if you make a purchase, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.

For example, you may provide us with another person\u2019s name and address in order to fulfill a gift subscription for that person. Such functionality is only intended for United States residents. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the U.S. and that you have your contacts\u2019 consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request.\n- Content - the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide to customer support.

Any communication you submit or that may be posted to a publicly viewable area of our Services, such as a comment on an article or a review, is a public communication and may be viewed by the general public. Therefore, you acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to such areas via our Services, whether or not your submission includes Personal Data. These submissions would include newsletter sign-ups and any area of our Service that requires a login or registration prior to use. If at any time you display your Personal Data in any communication submitted to such areas, other individuals may collect and use your Personal Data. We are not responsible for, nor can we guarantee the protection of, any Personal Data you disclose in a communication submitted to such areas for posting or contained in an email or other communication submitted to us for such posting, and thus, you acknowledge that if you disclose Personal Data in any such material, you do so at your own risk.\n-\nInformation We Receive From Other Sources\nWe may supplement the information we collect with outside records in order to learn more about our users, to better tailor the content and offers we show you, and for other purposes. We may receive this information about you from public sources or third parties, including without limitation consumer data resellers, social networks, and advertisers.

We share your information with third parties for the purposes of facilitating your requests (such as when you choose to share information with a social network about your activities on the Services) and in connection with tailoring advertisements, measuring and improving our Services and advertising effectiveness, and other enabling enhancements. We share aggregate information about our visitors with our advertisers, sponsors, and promotional partners, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the Service(s) or page(s), or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information is not specific to any individual visitor. We obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal the precise location of a specific visitor. We also obtain other demographic information from third parties to improve our products and services, for marketing purposes or to display more relevant advertising. In those circumstances, we disclose User Information so that such service providers perform those services.

We are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of operational providers, nor are we responsible or liable for their services.\nEvents\nOur Events and promotions may be jointly managed, sponsored or offered by third parties. If you voluntarily choose to enter or attend an Event, we may share your information with third parties as set forth in the official rules that govern the Event as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering a contest or sweepstakes Event, you agree to the official rules that govern that Event, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.

This information will be used to provide you the location-based services. We use third-party providers to help provide location-based services through mobile systems (unless you opt out of such location-based services with such providers) and we provide the information to such providers to enable them to provide their location-based services, provided that such providers use the information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\n-\nChoice/Opt-Out From Communications\nWe offer you the opportunity to manage your communications from us. Even after subscribing to one or more newsletters and/or opting in to one or more offers to receive marketing and/or promotional communications from us or our third-party partners, users may elect to modify their preferences by following the \u201cCommunications Preferences\u201d and/or \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link provided in an email or communication received. If you no longer wish to receive text messages from us, please follow the instructions provided in our text message. You may also be able to change your preferences by updating your profile or account, depending on which of our Services you are using. Please be aware that if you wish to remove yourself from a newsletter and/or other marketing emails from third parties that you consented to through the Services, you must do so by contacting the relevant third-party. Even if you do opt-out of marketing emails, we reserve the right to send you transactional and administrative emails including those related to the Services, service announcements, notices of changes to this Privacy Policy or other Services policies, and to contact you regarding any goods or services you have ordered.\n-\nRetaining, Modifying and Deleting Your Personal Data\nYou may request access to the information you have provided to us. If you wish to make a request, please contact us using the details in the Contact Us section below. If you would like to update, correct, modify or delete from our database any Personal Data you previously submitted to us, please let us know by logging in and updating your profile. If you delete certain information you may not be able to order services in the future without re-submitting such information. We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Also, please note that we will maintain Personal Data in our database whenever we are required to do so by law, for necessary operational reasons, or to maintain uniform business practices.\nPlease note that we need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (for example, when you enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Data provided until after the completion of such promotion). We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n-\nSecurity\nWe have implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures to help protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure; unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security. You use the Services and provide us with information at your own initiative and risk. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us using the details in the Contact Us section below.\n-\nLinks\nThe Services contain links to other websites that we do not control, and the Services contain videos, advertising and other content hosted and served by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party. We may also integrate with third parties who will interact with you under their terms of service.\n-\nChildren\u2019s Privacy\nWe especially care about the privacy of young children. Most of our Services, with the exception of certain child-directed services as described below, are intended for a general audience and are not intended for and should not be used by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 on our general audience services, and we do not target such services to children under the age of 16.\nSome of our Services are clearly identified as being marketed directly to children under the age of 16 (such as our Dodo Kids channel or other child-directed services). In connection with such child-directed services, we do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from users under the age of 16 without complying with applicable legal requirements and making appropriate disclosures. We are committed to compliance with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), a U.S. federal law designed to protect children online. We may collect and store persistent identifiers (such as IP addresses) from children without parental consent for the purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Services or as otherwise permitted under COPPA.\nFor any of our Services, if a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us using the details in the Contact Us section below. We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.\n-\nSensitive Personal Data\nWhen we conduct research or carry out surveys and you participate in our research or surveys, we may collect sensitive Personal Data about you, for example, information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation. We will get your explicit consent for our collection, use, or sharing of this data where required by law. Otherwise, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Data as this term is defined under applicable data protection and privacy laws on or through the Services or otherwise to us.\nIf you send or disclose any sensitive Personal Data to us or the public through the Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data, you must not submit such content to our Services, and you must contact us to make us aware immediately.\n-\nImportant Information for California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nWe collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) refers to such information as \u201cPersonal Information.\u201d If you are a California consumer, as defined by the CCPA, the CCPA provides you with specific rights regarding your Personal Information.

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access and Deletion Rights, below), and subject to certain limitations that we describe below, we will disclose such information. You have the right to request any or all of the following:\nYou have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access and Deletion Rights, below), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies. However, we may retain Personal Information that has been de-identified or aggregated. Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) in order to perform certain actions set forth under CCPA, such as detecting security incidents and protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.\nTo exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through our online form or email us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com. Alternatively, you may contact us with the details of your request at the following toll-free phone number: 1-800-478-9140. In the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days.\nOnly you, or a person or business entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (an \u201cauthorized agent\u201d), may make the requests set forth above.\nWe have a duty as the holder of certain personal information to verify your identity when making requests to know or delete personal information and to ensure that dissemination of that information would not cause harm to you if it were distributed to another person. To verify your identity, we will request and collect additional personal information from you to match it against our records. We may ask for additional information or documentation if we feel it is necessary to confirm your identity with the necessary degree of certainty. We may communicate with you through email, a secure message center, or other reasonably necessary and appropriate means. We do have the right to deny requests under certain circumstances. In such cases, we will notify you of the reasons for denial.\nYou have the right to direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time (the \"right to opt-out\"). We do not sell the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the \"right to opt-in\") from either the consumer who is at least 16 and less than 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 16 years of age.

Such programs will have additional terms that require your review and agreement. Please review those terms for the details of those programs, how to withdraw or cancel, or to assert your rights specific to those programs.\nWe generally do not treat consumers differently if they exercise a right under California law. However, in certain circumstances, discounted prices will require you to be on our mailing list or a member of our loyalty program. In such circumstances, we may offer a price difference because the price is reasonably related to the value of your data. The value of your data will be explained in the terms of such incentivized programs.\nShine the Light\nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties\u2019 and affiliates\u2019 own direct marketing purposes.

This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n- Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n- Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n- Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n- Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n- Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\nTo exercise your rights under the GDPR, please contact us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com.

The Google TV interface \u2014 running on top of the Android TV OS (Google\u2019s branding chaos remains undefeated) \u2014 has already been doing a really nice job of making it easy to find what you\u2019re looking for and constantly recommending new stuff to watch. But the Chromecast streaming dongle it ran on hasn\u2019t been able to keep up.\nGoogle TV Streamer review: smarter than your average set-top box\nWith more storage, a (slightly) faster processor, and some proper smart home chops, Google\u2019s new take on the Chromecast is its best attempt at a streaming device yet.\nGoogle TV Streamer review: smarter than your average set-top box\nWith more storage, a (slightly) faster processor, and some proper smart home chops, Google\u2019s new take on the Chromecast is its best attempt at a streaming device yet.\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nNow, Google TV is getting the hardware to match.\nThe Google TV Streamer 4K, which goes on sale tomorrow for $99.99, is an upgrade in every way over the Chromecast with Google TV. There\u2019s a new processor, a built-in ethernet port, plus double the RAM and four times the storage of the Chromecast. It supports Matter for your smart home, and a Thread radio makes it a Thread border router, which Jen will tell you more about in a bit.\nAll of this means Google finally has an up-to-date set-top box that shares streaming and smart home duties. Google hasn\u2019t provided details of the new processor (there are reports it\u2019s the same MediaTek chip the Fire TV Stick 4K uses), but it\u2019s clearly not as overpowered as the more expensive Apple TV with the literal chip of an iPhone inside. Still, it\u2019s good to see Google getting serious in this space.\nGoogle TV Streamer (4K)\nThe Good\n- Excellent streaming UI\n- Google Assistant on board is a great navigator\n- Fast, easy-to-use smart home controls\n- Smart home hub with Matter, Thread, and a built-in ethernet port\n- Handy Find My feature for the remote, with a speaker\nThe Bad\n- Not a big enough speed bump\n- Can\u2019t pair with Nest speakers for TV audio\n- Only supports Wi-Fi 5\nWith this new hardware, the dongle is gone. This is a grown-up set-top box, designed to sit out on your media console. As slabs of plastic go, it\u2019s fine; my only real note here is that you should buy the dark \u201chazel\u201d color. I opted for the lighter \u201cporcelain\u201d for my review unit, and it\u2019s quite noticeable sitting underneath my TV.\nI don\u2019t mind that Google switched from dongle to box \u2014 I\u2019m happy to have made that trade for the Streamer\u2019s ethernet port and smart home controls, plus the really handy button that pings your remote when it\u2019s lost in the couch \u2014 but there\u2019s a reason virtually all TV gadgets are black. And if you\u2019re coming from a Chromecast and looking to keep that visual simplicity, it\u2019ll be easy to tape or Velcro the Streamer to the back of your TV.\nIt\u2019s not slow, and it\u2019s noticeably faster than the lag-plagued Chromecast from a few years ago, but it\u2019s definitely not fast\nWhile slightly larger, the remote is virtually identical to the one that shipped with the Chromecast with Google TV four years ago. It does HDMI-CEC and IR controls, has voice control, runs on AAA batteries, and now has a mappable shortcut button.\nI\u2019m a little less enthusiastic about the remote than my colleague Chris Welch was back in 2020: I wish the D-pad and the select button were a little better differentiated, and the power button is too far away from everything else. But by and large, it\u2019s a fine remote, and its smooth, round edges feel good to fiddle with.\nGetting the Streamer ready to watch shows and movies is simple enough and roughly the same process as any other set-top box. You do most of the setup in the Google Home app on your phone, which is how you log it in to your Google account and connect the Streamer to your smart home devices. (You can also do things directly on the screen by clicking around with the remote, but it\u2019ll take forever. Your phone is your friend.)\nOne particularly nice feature: as part of the setup process, the Home app asks which streaming services you use and then automatically downloads them to the box.\nGoogle TV Streamer specs\n- Price: $99.99\n- Colors: white and gray\n- Resolution: up to 4K HDR, 60fps\n- Video Formats: Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10 Plus, HLG\n- Audio Formats: Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby Atmos\n- Connectivity: Wi-Fi (2.4GHz / 5GHz), Bluetooth 5.2, Matter, Thread border router\n- Memory: 4GB\n- Storage: 32GB\n- Ports: USB-C, HDMI 2.1, ethernet\n- Google Voice Remote uses two AAA batteries and Bluetooth IR\nThe Streamer can handle 4K video with Dolby Vision and does Dolby Atmos audio as well. If your TV and audio gear support it, you can also set up the Streamer\u2019s remote to control your other devices. You\u2019re also prompted during setup to create multiple profiles, including kid-specific ones \u2014 hooray! \u2014 and to pick whether you want your screensaver to be from your Google Photos or some AI-generated art. (Jen asked it to generate images of a South Carolina sunset, and the AI made sunset \u201cphotos\u201d that looked like they were taken on the worst camera you could find.) The whole setup process, including a necessary software update, took me maybe 10 minutes.\nThe fastest way I\u2019ve found to do almost anything on the Streamer is via voice. In more nonsensical branding, the Streamer\u2019s voice assistant is Google Assistant and not Gemini, even though Google says it\u2019s Gemini technology under the hood. What matters is that Google TV handles voice commands mostly very well. \u201cPlay Industry on Max\u201d took me exactly where it should. \u201cShow me Mission: Impossible movies\u201d brought them all up, in order. \u201cPlay Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d triggered a menu with all the places I can watch the show.\nGoogle TV handles voice commands mostly very well\nIt\u2019s not perfect: \u201cPlay \u2018Hot Ones\u2019 on YouTube\u201d didn\u2019t work, but \u201cfind \u2018Hot Ones\u2019 videos on YouTube\u201d did, and while it\u2019s handy to have Google Assistant tell me all the places Brooklyn Nine-Nine is available, it should be able to learn that I\u2019m watching the show on Peacock and just take me there.\nIn general, though, if you know what you want to watch \u2014 and especially if you know what service it\u2019s on \u2014 there\u2019s no faster way to navigate any set-top box than via Google Assistant here. And, of course, the Streamer is still a Chromecast, so you can use your phone to find and cast stuff to your screen as well.\nFlipping around the homescreen looking for something to watch, I encountered the most disappointing thing about the Streamer: it\u2019s not fast. It\u2019s not slow, and it\u2019s noticeably faster than the lag-plagued Chromecast from a few years ago, but it\u2019s definitely not fast.\nThe five-year-old Nvidia Shield is noticeably zippier and smoother as I open and close apps and scroll the interface, as is the latest Apple TV. Given how much Google hyped the processor and RAM upgrades on this device and how much more expensive it is as a result, it\u2019s a little disappointing. It also makes me nervous for the future given the Chromecast with Google TV\u2019s reputation for degrading performance over time.\nBut today, it\u2019s fast enough. And it\u2019s when you don\u2019t know what you want to watch that Google TV really shines \u2014 on the Streamer and elsewhere. It aggregates FAST channels from its own Freeplay service and more, so there\u2019s lots of live and free stuff to watch. The \u201cTrending on Google\u201d row is extremely zeitgeist-y and fun. Just given what it already knows about you, from YouTube and Search and elsewhere, plus the ongoing work it\u2019s doing with Gemini, Google has a nearly insurmountable advantage when it comes to recommending stuff you\u2019ll like, and it shows.\nThat\u2019s what makes the Google TV Streamer an excellent streaming device. But what takes it over the top is its smart home features \u2014 and for that, my colleague Jen has the details below.\nSmart TV, smart home\nStreaming may be in the name, but the Google TV Streamer also quietly doubles as a very capable smart home hub. I\u2019m a big proponent of marrying the smart TV with the smart home; it\u2019s just a natural fit.\nWith Matter controller and Thread border router chops, the Streamer can connect smart home devices like lights, locks, and thermostats to Google Home, just like Google\u2019s Nest Hubs can. But thanks to a built-in ethernet port and a new smart home panel, it\u2019s a more robust option for putting at the heart of your smart home than the Nest Hub (second-gen) or Nest Hub Max. It\u2019s also much snappier than either of those.\nIn fact, the Google TV Streamer is the only Google Home hub that supports Matter, Thread, ethernet, Google Assistant voice control (through the remote), and smart display functions (through your TV) all in one package, making it my new recommendation for the best smart home hub for Google Home.\nWith the new smart home panel, the Streamer brings direct control of the smart home to Google TV for the first time outside of voice. The panel, which first appeared on Google\u2019s Pixel Tablet (which should have been a smart home hub but isn\u2019t), pops up on your TV screen to offer shortcuts to turn off lights or view your cameras with the press of a button.\nThe Home panel takes a lot of design cues from the Apple TV, which \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 the entire device does. But I was pleased to see that it offers more flexibility, more options, and is more intuitive than the Apple TV\u2019s version for smart home control.\nStreamer side notes\n- The Google TV Streamer comes with a USB-C power cable and power brick but no ethernet cable or HDMI 2.1 cable, so if you don\u2019t have any spare cables, factor the purchase of those into the price.\n- It only supports Wi-Fi 5. This is maybe not an issue for most people, but for smart homes with lots of devices on the network, the more efficient Wi-Fi 6 or the option to run your TV on the 6GHz band with Wi-Fi 6E could be beneficial. Ethernet does help here, though.\n- You can\u2019t use Nest speakers for TV audio from the Streamer, though you can pair Bluetooth devices like earbuds to it and add the TV speakers to audio groups in the Home app.\n- The remote\u2019s Find My feature also works with voice control. Ask a Nest speaker, \u201cWhere\u2019s the TV remote?\u201d and it will beep away.\n- The Thread radio can be enabled and disabled in Settings \u2014 useful for troubleshooting any Thread network issues.\n- The Streamer can show Gemini-powered Personalized Results on the ambient screen, but that apparently takes some time to appear, as none showed up in our testing.\n- Long-pressing the Home button on the remote opens the Streamer Settings, a great quality-of-life feature for reviewers constantly tinkering with settings!\n- The new voice remote also works with the Chromecast with Google TV.\nThe panel is based around the Google Home app interface, so it feels familiar. It has the same fixed shortcuts that take you to cameras, lights, and climate controls. Then there\u2019s the same scrollable list of your \u201cFavorites,\u201d which can include everything from individual devices or cameras to groups and automations.\nI was impressed at how fast the panel was for controlling lights and automations \u2014 the lights in my living room turned on and off instantly, and a Movie Time scene controlling multiple devices executed in seconds \u2014 much faster than using voice control through the Chromecast or a Nest speaker.\nIn my few days of testing the device, I found myself picking up the remote to use the Streamer to control my lights more than using my phone. Thanks to the option to program the new shortcut button on the remote to open the panel, it got me to the controls faster. It\u2019s also nice not to have to reach for the distraction that is my phone while watching TV.\nPulling up live feeds from connected cameras took a bit longer, but I\u2019m fine with that now that there is finally the option to have your video doorbell show automatically on the TV when someone\u2019s at the door. This is a feature Fire TVs and Apple TVs have had for years. On the Streamer, a small picture-in-picture appears in the top right, showing a snapshot of your visitor, with the option to click \u201cview\u201d to see the full-screen feed. (You have to be quick here since it goes away in a few seconds.)\nThe picture-in-picture part only works with Google Nest doorbells (I tested it with the battery-powered Nest Doorbell), but Google says you will still get a text notification on the TV when using any doorbell compatible with the Google Home app and can then pull up a livestream.\nThe biggest downside of the Home panel is that you can\u2019t customize it; it\u2019s persistent across devices. What I select for the Favorites section in the Google Home app on my phone is what shows up on my TV. It would be nice to choose the cameras I want to see and the lights and automations I want to access based on which room the Streamer is in. But that\u2019s a minor quibble.\nThere is finally the option to have your video doorbell show automatically on the TV when someone\u2019s at the door\nThe addition of support for Matter and Thread, a mesh networking protocol designed for IoT devices, elevates the Streamer to true smart home hub status. Thread is one of two wireless protocols the new Matter smart home standard supports, and it creates a more reliable communication pathway for low-power smart devices like lights, locks, and sensors throughout your home. Current Google Nest Hubs and Google Nest Wifi routers are also Thread border routers, and the more border routers you have, the more reliable your network will be (as long as they\u2019re all from the same company, for now).\nAdditionally, Google\u2019s new Home runtime feature, which is coming to its Google Home hubs later this year, will enable direct local control of gadgets over Matter. This should significantly reduce latency when issuing commands to smart devices.\nIt\u2019s these smart home capabilities that make the Streamer worth purchasing over the $50 Google TV with Chromecast or Walmart\u2019s Onn 4K Pro. Neither of those works with Thread, and neither can automatically pull up a livestream on your TV when someone rings your doorbell or let you control smart lights and adjust your thermostat on the big screen.\nDavid and I agree: this is the best set-top box Google has made yet. It\u2019s not some earth-shattering new idea or game-changing improvement on the formula, but Google TV is the best streaming UI on the market, and the hardware doesn\u2019t hold the streamer back this time. Combined with an easy-to-use smart home panel and Matter and Thread support, all for under $100, this is the set-top box we\u2019d recommend to most people.\nAgree to continue: Google TV Streamer 4K (2024)\nEvery smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate.\nTo use the Google TV Streamer 4K, you must agree to:\n- Google Terms of Service\n- Google Play Terms of Service\n- Google Privacy Policy (included in ToS)\n- Google Device Arbitration Agreement (you can opt out by following the instructions in that agreement.)\nStreaming services also have their own terms of service and privacy policies.\nFinal tally: at least three mandatory agreements.\nPhotos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge"

      "text": "The holy grail of the smart home is ambient computing \u2014 technology that disappears into the background, anticipating your needs without a word or a tap. Lights turn on as you walk in, doors unlock as you approach, coffee brews before you reach the kitchen. This is the proactive home: a space that adapts to its occupants to support their comfort, health, and safety. The tools exist to create this, but today\u2019s smart home remains complicated, unreliable, and often invasive \u2014 still a long way from truly \u201cambient.\u201d\nAI could bring us a smarter home \u2014 if we can trust it\nAt IFA 2025, tech giants and startups alike will show us their visions for how AI could make connected homes more intuitive, context-aware, and truly ambient.\nAt IFA 2025, tech giants and startups alike will show us their visions for how AI could make connected homes more intuitive, context-aware, and truly ambient.\nBut, just as it\u2019s changing every other game in tech, advances in artificial intelligence are a watershed moment for the smart home. The rise of AI agents that tap into language and visual models is the technology that could take us from the command-and-control era of home automation to living in the Starship Enterprise, where our every need can be served by Star Trek\u2019s Computer (assuming that\u2019s what you want).\nWe\u2019re not anywhere near there yet, but at this week\u2019s IFA consumer tech show in Berlin, Germany, I expect to see companies talking about how they plan to get there. While every announcement will likely feature \u201cAI,\u201d I\u2019ll be looking for those with real potential to make products better, smarter, and easier to use, while keeping data local and private.\nI\u2019ve already started to see glimpses of how AI can improve the smart home. New features on my Ring security cameras, powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs), mean they can tell me what\u2019s happening instead of just showing me. I now get a notification with a generated description of the event \u2014 such as \u201ca brown chicken is pecking in the garden.\u201d It\u2019s a lot more helpful than \u201cmotion detected.\u201d\nToday, my Nest video doorbell can alert me when a package has been removed, as well as when it arrives. When I pair it with an ADT security system, the doorbell is smart enough to recognize when my neighbor\u2019s at the door and unlock my smart lock so she can put the package inside my house.\nOf course, some of this is machine learning, which isn\u2019t new in the smart home. The Nest Learning Thermostat has been learning your routines and adapting your heating and cooling automatically for a decade. Alexa\u2019s hunches feature has been telling me things I might have forgotten to do \u2014 lock the door, turn off the lights \u2014 for years now.\nHowever, the context and awareness that new LLM- and VLM-powered assistants, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa Plus and Google\u2019s Gemini for the Home, could unlock has the potential to take us to the next level. If we want the vision of the Enterprise, we need Star Trek\u2019s Computer.\nWhat happens at home should stay at home\nTech giants Amazon, Google, Samsung, and LG are building platforms that coordinate and process data from all the sensors, appliances, cameras, and devices in your home. Today, some of these systems can go beyond simple command and control to recognize patterns, automate routines, and anticipate some of your home and family\u2019s needs based on learned behaviour as well as programmed automation.\nThis could range from simple tasks, such as brewing your morning coffee when it senses you\u2019ve woken up, closing the blinds when it detects you\u2019re asleep, to more advanced features like potentially sending a repairman to fix your ice maker at the right moment, or managing how your home uses energy.\nAt IFA this week, LG is showcasing its Affectionate Intelligence, powered by its FURON AI Agent, and Samsung will likely be promoting how its SmartThings home automation platform integrates with its Home AI system to help automate your home more easily.\nIf we want the vision of the Enterprise, we need Star Trek\u2019s Computer.\nOf course, these AI-powered platforms raise privacy concerns. Most rely on the cloud for the processing power to implement AI features, meaning the private data your home generates \u2014 who is home, what they are doing \u2014 may not stay in the home.\nHowever, unlike in the mobile world, the home doesn\u2019t need an always-on cloud connection. AI processing on the edge is becoming increasingly viable as technology continues to mature. At IFA this week, I\u2019ll be looking for smart home applications that use local AI models. If you\u2019re going to showcase the importance of privacy in the smart home, Europe is the place to do it \u2014 it has some of the most robust data privacy protection in the world.\nAnother major hurdle to this whole-home vision is infrastructure. For a home to respond to its occupants, it requires sensors and data points throughout (one reason why the South Korean appliance giants already have a strong foothold). Just last month, a new smart home company emerged that\u2019s looking to solve this problem.\nFrom the team behind the August smart lock, Doma is an AI-powered system that relies on hardwired mmWave sensors throughout your home to predict what you want it to do next. Precise enough to detect your breathing, this type of sensor could track nearly every activity in your home. But it\u2019s a big ask to expect people to add devices and sensors everywhere. These types of solutions seem best suited to new construction or high-end remodels. It would be a lot easier to use devices already in our homes.\nPhilips Hue could announce a new tech at IFA that does exactly that. Its rumoured MotionAware sensing will leverage radios in its millions of existing light bulbs to turn them into motion sensors for your home. The idea is to have your lights turn on and off based on where you are, but the potential of all these data points is a mouthwatering one for anyone looking to build a proactive, ambient smart home.\nMatter may also help here. As an open-source interoperability standard, it can connect the common devices we bring into our homes, providing a platform for future AI agents to tap into. Cameras will also be key to any company\u2019s vision of AI in the home, generating richer data for VLMs to interpret. Amazon and Google have a head start in this area with their Ring and Nest cameras, which is likely why Apple is eyeing cameras as its next move in the home.\nWhile we wait for these futuristic visions to become more than a vision, more focused applications of AI can help more people get more out of their smart homes \u2014 by using LLMs to cut through the complications and busywork many smart home devices require.\nFor example, Govee and Aqara added chatbots to their apps in the last year to help you access their capabilities, and I\u2019ve just started playing with Philips Hue\u2019s new AI assistant, which launched in the US last month. As a rule, a chatbot popping up in an app is a dealbreaker for me, but I\u2019ve found it surprisingly handy with Hue. It turns out simply typing what I want my lights to do and have it actually happen \u2014 \u201cset good makeup lighting on my vanity\u201d \u2014 is much easier than fiddling with sliders in an app, navigating through endless screens, or asking a voice assistant to try, and likely fail, to do it.\nWith companies like Reolink, Aqara, and Eufy announcing new products at IFA this week, I expect to see more innovations leveraging the context and knowledge AI can provide to make it easier to keep your home feeling safe and secure.\nOf course, there are still big questions around the reliability of AI in the smart home. A single mistake in an AI-driven home can have real consequences, and recent reports of AI going off the rails underscore that risk. I\u2019ll be looking closely at the safeguards companies are implementing to secure this technology. The smart home doesn\u2019t need artificial general intelligence \u2014 just enough intelligence to move from reactive to proactive, and finally deliver the Star Trek promise."

These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services \u2013 such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.\nAlthough we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.\nRespect others\n- comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws\n- respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights\n- don\u2019t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) \u2014 for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others\nOur service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren\u2019t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\nDon\u2019t abuse our services\nMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don\u2019t respect those rules, so we\u2019re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:\nYou must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems \u2014 for example, by:- introducing malware\n- spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures\n- jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programs\n- accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:\n- phishing\n- creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews\n- misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human\n- providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us\n- providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not\n- using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone\u2019s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights\n- reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law\n- using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)\n- using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology\n- hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms\n- providing services that encourage others to violate these terms\nPermission to use your content\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you\u2019re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nLicense\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else\u2019s creative content if they\u2019ve given you their permission.\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.\nWhat\u2019s covered\nThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nWhat\u2019s not covered\n- This license doesn\u2019t affect your data protection rights \u2014 it\u2019s only about your intellectual property rights\n- This license doesn\u2019t cover these types of content:\n- publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn\u2019t require a license because it\u2019s considered common knowledge that everyone\u2019s free to use.\n- feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the Service-related communications section below.\nScope\n- worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world\n- non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others\n- royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license\nRights\nThis license allows Google to:\n- host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content \u2014 for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go\n- publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you\u2019ve made it visible to others\n- modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it\n- sublicense these rights to:\n- other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose\n- our contractors who\u2019ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below\nPurpose\nThis license is for the limited purpose of:\n- operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:\n- for spam, malware, and illegal content\n- to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together\n- to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)\n- using content you\u2019ve shared publicly to promote the services.

Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.\n- developing new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms\nDuration\nThis license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nIf you remove from our services any content that\u2019s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:\n- If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend\u2019s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.\n- If you make your content available through other companies\u2019 services, it\u2019s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.\nUsing Google services\nYour Google Account\nIf you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work \u2014 for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.\nYou\u2019re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.\nUsing Google services on behalf of an organization or business\n- an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms\n- your organization\u2019s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.\nService-related communications\nTo provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nIf you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.\nContent in Google services\nYour content\nSome of our services allow you to generate original content. Google won\u2019t claim ownership over that content.\nSome of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available \u2014 for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.\n- See the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services\n- See the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services\nIf you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we\u2019ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.\nGoogle content\nSome of our services include content that belongs to Google \u2014 for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google\u2019s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don\u2019t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.\nOther content\nFinally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations \u2014 for example, a store owner\u2019s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization\u2019s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations\u2019 content are theirs, and don\u2019t necessarily reflect Google\u2019s views.\nSoftware in Google services\nSome of our services include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.\n- worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world\n- non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others\n- royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license\n- personal, which means it doesn\u2019t extend to anyone else\n- non-assignable, which means you\u2019re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else\nSome of our services include software that\u2019s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.\nYou may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.\nIn case of problems or disagreements\nBoth the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. If you\u2019re a consumer, then you enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law, as well as any additional rights provided under these terms or service-specific additional terms.\nLegal guarantee\nIf you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, and you\u2019ve agreed to our Terms of Service, then EEA consumer laws provide you with a legal guarantee covering the digital content, services, or goods that we provide you. Under this guarantee, we\u2019re liable for any lack of conformity that you discover:\n- within two years of the delivery of goods (such as a phone) or the one-time supply of digital content or services (such as purchasing a movie)\n- at any time during the \u201ccontinuous\u201d supply of digital content or services (such as Maps or Gmail)\nYour national laws may provide an even longer guarantee. Your rights under these legal guarantees aren\u2019t limited by any other commercial guarantees that we provide. If you want to make a guarantee claim, please contact us.\nLiabilities\nFor all users\n- fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation\n- death or personal injury caused by negligence\n- gross negligence\n- willful misconduct\nOther than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms, subject to applicable law.\nFor business users and organizations only\nIf you\u2019re a business user or organization:\n- To the extent allowed by applicable law, you\u2019ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.\n- If you\u2019re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don\u2019t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don\u2019t override those immunities.\n- Google won\u2019t be responsible for the following liabilities:\n- loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings\n- indirect or consequential loss\n- punitive damages\n- Except as stated in the For all users section above, Google\u2019s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) \u20ac500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.\nTaking action in case of problems\nBefore taking action as described below, we\u2019ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\n- cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google\n- violate the law or a legal enforcement authority\u2019s order\n- compromise an investigation\n- compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services\nRemoving your content\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\nWithout limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\n- you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies\n- we\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order\n- we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google \u2014 for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn\u2019t belong to you\nFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\nOf course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, you can also withdraw from these terms within 14 days of accepting them. If you do stop using a service, we\u2019d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\nHandling requests for your data\nRespect for the privacy and security of your data underpins our approach to responding to data disclosure requests. When we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google\u2019s data disclosure policies. Google Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland. For more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our Transparency Report and Privacy Policy.\nSettling disputes, governing law, and courts\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\nIf you\u2019re a resident of, or an organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, these terms and your relationship with Google under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts. If you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, please contact us to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an Online Dispute Resolution platform, but Google isn\u2019t legally required to use this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we\u2019ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\nIf you don\u2019t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2014 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don\u2019t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.\nEEA instructions on withdrawal\nIf you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, then EEA consumer law gives you the right to withdraw from this contract as described in the EU\u2019s Model Instructions on Withdrawal, provided below.\nRight of withdrawal\nYou have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.\nThe withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.\nTo exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail). You can contact us by email at account-withdrawal@google.com; by phone\nTo meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.\nEffects of withdrawal\nIf you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.\nModel withdrawal form\n(complete and return this form only if you wish to withdraw from the contract)\n\u2014 To Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, account-withdrawal@google.com:\n\u2014 I hereby give notice that I withdraw from my contract of sale for the provision of the following service, _____________\n\u2014 Ordered on, _____________\n\u2014 Name of consumer, _____________\n\u2014 Address of consumer, _____________\n\u2014 Signature of consumer (only if this form is notified on paper), _____________\n\u2014 Date _____________\nContact Google to withdraw from these terms\n| Country | Phone number |\n|---|---|\n| Austria | 0800 001180 |\n| \u00c5land Islands | 0800 526683 |\n| Belgium | 0800 58 142 |\n| Bulgaria | 0800 14 744 |\n| Canary Islands | +34 912 15 86 27 |\n| Ceuta & Melilla | +34 912 15 86 27 |\n| Croatia | 0800 787 086 |\n| Cyprus | 80 092492 |\n| Czechia | 800 720 070 |\n| Denmark | 80 40 01 11 |\n| Estonia | 8002 643 |\n| Finland | 0800 520030 |\n| France | 0 805 98 03 38 |\n| French Guiana | 0805 98 03 38 |\n| French Polynesia | +33 1 85 14 96 65 |\n| French Southern Territories | +33 1 85 14 96 65 |\n| Germany | 0800 6270502 |\n| Greece | 21 1180 9433 |\n| Guadeloupe | 0805 98 03 38 |\n| Hungary | 06 80 200 148 |\n| Iceland | 800 4177 |\n| Ireland | 1800 832 663 |\n| Italy | 800 598 905 |\n| Latvia | 80 205 391 |\n| Liechtenstein | 0800 566 814 |\n| Lithuania | 0 800 00 163 |\n| Luxembourg | 800 40 005 |\n| Malta | 8006 2257 |\n| Martinique | 0805 98 03 38 |\n| Mayotte | +33 1 85 14 96 65 |\n| Netherlands | 0800 3600010 |\n| New Caledonia | +33 1 85 14 96 65 |\n| Norway | 800 62 068 |\n| Poland | 800 410 575 |\n| Portugal | 808 203 430 |\n| R\u00e9union | 0805 98 03 38 |\n| Romania | 0800 672 350 |\n| Slovakia | 0800 500 932 |\n| Slovenia | 080 688882 |\n| Spain | 900 906 451 |\n| St. Barth\u00e9lemy | +33 1 85 14 96 65 |\n| St. Martin | +33 1 85 14 96 65 |\n| St. Pierre & Miquelon | +33 1 85 14 96 65 |\n| Svalbard & Jan Mayen | 800 62 425 |\n| Sweden | 020-012 52 41 |\n| Vatican City | 800 599 102 |\n| Wallis & Futuna | +33 1 85 14 96 65 |\nDefinitions\naffiliate\nAn entity that belongs to the Google group of companies, which means Google LLC and its subsidiaries, including the following companies that provide consumer services in the EU: Google Ireland Limited, Google Commerce Limited, and Google Dialer Inc.\nbusiness user\nAn individual or entity who is not a consumer (see consumer).\ncommercial guarantee\nA commercial guarantee is a voluntary commitment that is in addition to the legal guarantee of conformity.

      "text": "Kwikset is doubling down on open standards and new technologies as it expands its smart lock offerings. In an exclusive interview with The Verge, the company revealed that it will launch its first NFC-powered tap-to-unlock smart lock, as well as a less expensive Matter-over-Thread deadbolt, and a smart garage door opener this fall. Kwikset also plans to adopt ultra-wideband (UWB) as part of the new Aliro standard, and it shared that its sister brand, Baldwin, is adding Matter to its locks through a partnership with Level.\nKwikset\u2019s new locks point to a smarter, more open future for your front door\nThe company is launching three new models, including one with tap-to-unlock, a cheaper Matter lock, and a smart garage door opener.\nThe company is launching three new models, including one with tap-to-unlock, a cheaper Matter lock, and a smart garage door opener.\nLaunching later this year, the Halo Select Plus is an NFC-enabled version of Kwikset\u2019s Halo Select smart lock, Jeff Sandoval, marketing director at Kwikset, told The Verge. The Select Plus will arrive later this year with all the same features as the Select \u2014 including a touchscreen keypad, Matter-over-Thread support, built-in Wi-Fi, and hands-free auto-unlock \u2014 plus a new tap-to-unlock feature that uses a compatible phone or watch as your key.\nKwikset couldn\u2019t publicly confirm final compatibility, but the lock is likely to work with Apple\u2019s Home Key, which allows you to tap your iPhone or Apple Watch against your door to unlock it. If so, it would be the company\u2019s first lock to support this feature.\nApple is currently the only major phone maker to offer NFC tap-to-unlock for residential doors without requiring a proprietary app. Manufacturers must work directly with Apple to enable Home Key support, either through HomeKit or Apple Home via Matter. This has meant that there aren\u2019t many Home Key-enabled smart locks. But that\u2019s about to change.\nApple, along with Samsung and Google, is part of Aliro, an upcoming open standard for smart locks and digital keys that will enable a phone and lock to communicate directly over Bluetooth, NFC, and ultra-wideband, without needing an app. Aliro should make it easier for lock makers to support NFC unlocking and bring Home Key-like functionality to Android phones and wearables, ultimately making tap-to-unlock universal regardless of the phone or smart home platform used.\nThe standard, which was supposed to launch this year, still lacks an official specification, so it couldn\u2019t be included in the Halo Select Plus. It\u2019s possible the Select Plus has the technical capability to support Aliro, but Kwikset wouldn\u2019t confirm this. Sandoval said the company plans to launch an Aliro-compatible lock, but that it won\u2019t be this year.\nKwikset is also introducing a Matter-over-Thread version of its mid-range Aura line later this year. The new Aura Reach features a backlit keypad with a built-in proximity sensor, which illuminates the keypad as you approach it at night. It works over Bluetooth with the Kwikset app or over Matter-over-Thread with platforms such as Apple Home, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa. Compared to the Select line, the Aura lacks built-in Wi-Fi, a touchscreen, and a door sensor.\nKwikset declined to share pricing for either of its new models. However, the current Aura line starts around $150, and the Halo Select is $279. So, my guess is the Plus may cost around $300, with the Reach hopefully coming in under $200.\nThe addition of Matter to its lower-cost line is a sign that the company is embracing the new smart home standard, following the launch of its first Matter lock earlier this year. Despite a slow start, Sandoval said Kwikset is \u201cfully committed to Matter,\u201d noting that while consumer awareness of the standard is still relatively low, the customers who have used it \u201cdon\u2019t want to go back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will either prefer or only purchase Matter devices in the future.\u201d\nKwikset customers who have used Matter \u201cdon\u2019t want to go back\u201d\nMatter offers local connectivity to smart home devices, which improves response time and allows them to be controlled from your phone at home, even when the internet is down \u2014 a key feature for a lock. Kwikset uses the Matter-over-Thread protocol, which consumes less power than Wi-Fi, significantly extending battery life.\nKwikset\u2019s luxury sister brand, Baldwin, is also adding Matter through a partnership with Level Locks. (All three brands are now owned by Assa Abloy.) Later this year, several of Baldwin\u2019s deadbolts will be available with the company\u2019s Level Bolt lock built in, bringing more high-end hardware options to the smart home. The Bolt is a smart lock with all the electronics and power incorporated into the deadbolt itself. So, from the outside, they look like a standard Baldwin lock, but inside, they have smart features such as auto-unlock, auto-lock, and app-based control.\nThe new Baldwin locks will support Bluetooth and Matter-over-Thread, can be controlled with a new Baldwin app (a rebranded version of Level\u2019s), and work with any Matter platform. They can connect to Wi-Fi through the optional Level Connect Wi-Fi Bridge, which is a good option if you don\u2019t want to use a smart home app like Apple Home but still want to control your lock remotely.\nNotably, neither Kwikset nor Baldwin\u2019s new smart locks include fingerprint readers or other biometric options, such as wave-to-unlock or facial unlock, which have appeared on some locks over the last few years. Sandoval said the company is betting on people using smartphones and watches as keys instead. \u201cPassive authentication and unlock-in-stride using a smartphone as authentication, UWB and Aliro specifically, is where we think there is the largest potential for adoption,\u201d he said.\nUnlock-in-stride refers to ultra-wideband hands-free unlocking, where your phone automatically unlocks the door as you approach, with no need to pull out your phone or tap your watch. A couple of UWB-enabled locks were announced at CES this year, including one from Schlage. Both Apple and Samsung support the tech on their latest phones. However, we won\u2019t see widespread adoption until the Aliro standard is launched, as the open standard should be the simplest way that manufacturers can ensure their locks will work with all compatible smartphones.\nIn the meantime, Kwikset is moving into the garage. Its new Flex smart garage door opener arrives next month. Built with Amarr Garage Doors, another Assa Abloy-owned company, the Flex is a full replacement garage door controller that Sandoval says is super small and super quiet.\nThe Flex integrates with the Kwikset app for remote control and scheduling, allowing you to control all your home\u2019s doors in one app. It will also support HomeLink, Android Auto, and CarPlay, for control from your car screen, and work with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, with Matter support planned for the future. The Flex will be sold directly through garage door installers in the US and Canada.\nKwikset isn\u2019t the only smart lock maker betting on Matter and Aliro. Yale, Schlage, and most of the other players in this space are all working towards incorporating these interoperable standards into their products. And that\u2019s a good thing. It should help remove these products from siloed ecosystems and proprietary features that currently befuddle the market, making it easier to buy a smart lock that works with any phone and any smart home platform. After all, the real unlock here will be when your door doesn\u2019t care what phone you have."
