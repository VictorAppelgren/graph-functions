  "description": "As nations began a second week of negotiations Monday for a global accord to end plastic pollution, an artist heaped piles of plastic garbage onto a large sculpture in front of the United Nations office.",
  "content": "Benjamin Von Wong, right, a Canadian artist and activist, heaps plastic waste onto a large sculpture he designed in front of the United Nations in Geneva on Monday.\n\nAs nations began a second week of negotiations Monday for a global accord to end plastic pollution, an artist heaped piles of plastic waste onto a large sculpture in front of the United Nations office.\n\nDelegates to the treaty talks pass by the sculpture daily in a reminder of their responsibility to solve the plastic pollution crisis. The talks are scheduled to conclude Thursday.\n\nBenjamin Von Wong, a Canadian artist and activist, designed the nearly 18-foot sculpture called the \u201cThinker\u2019s Burden\u201d and built it with a team. It\u2019s his take on the famous sculpture by Auguste Rodin, \u201cThe Thinker\u201d in Paris. There is a male figure in deep thought, like Rodin depicted. But instead of sitting atop a rock, Von Wong\u2019s figure sits atop Mother Earth while cradling a baby and clutching plastic bottles. A strand of DNA intertwines them to highlight the health effects of plastic pollution.\n\nWith the help of volunteers, Von Wong is adding plastic waste to the installation over the course of the negotiations to reflect the growing cost of inaction. He climbed a ladder Monday to reach the top of the sculpture and weave plastic bottles through the DNA. He put a plastic toy car in front.\n\n\u201cBy the end of this week, we should have a sculpture almost completely drowned in plastics, however, the hope is, a strong and ambitious plastics treaty means that we can solve this problem once and for all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minderoo Foundation, an Australian philanthropic organization, was the largest donor for the project. Local nonprofits and community groups collected the plastic trash.\n\nStanding by the sculpture, Maria Ivanova, an expert in international environmental governance, said it \u201cwakes you up.\u201d Ivanova is the co-director of the Plastics Center at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t change their minds because of facts. They do because of feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is where I think art is absolutely critical to shift the needle on policy.\u201d\n\nDelegates and tourists stopped to ask Von Wong about his work and pose for photos in front of it. Michael Bonser, head of the Canadian delegation, called the artwork \u201cextraordinarily profound.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gives us a sense, every day, of what we need to be doing inside the room, what we need to walk out with. And that\u2019s a deal that allows us to reverse the trend,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be challenging, but I think it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nAbout 3,700 people are taking part in the talks, representing 184 countries and more than 600 organizations. They are crafting the first global, legally binding treaty on plastics pollution.\n\nMany agree the pace of the negotiations needs to speed up. They arrived in Geneva with hundreds of disagreements to be resolved. The number of unresolved issues grew last week, instead of shrinking.\n\nEuropean Commissioner Jessika Roswall said she\u2019s concerned about the lack of progress, and \u201cit\u2019s time to get results.\u201d Roswall is commissioner for environment, water resilience and a competitive circular economy.\n\nUnited Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told reporters it\u2019s still possible to agree on a treaty this week that ends plastic pollution.\n\n\u201cThis is within grasp,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cThe window remains open to leave Geneva with this treaty.\u201d\n\nMcDermott writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "Artist sues museum and city of L.A. after his work is accidentally thrown away\n- Share via\nBut is it art? That\u2019s the question at the center of a dispute between a Los Angeles museum and an artist who showed there.\nArtist David Lew, who goes by the name Shark Toof, has sued the Chinese American Museum and the city of Los Angeles, among other defendants, for throwing his work in the trash after displaying it.\nLew, who splits his time between L.A. and Detroit, was one of nine graffiti artists and muralists featured in the 2018 exhibition \u201cDon\u2019t Believe the Hype: L.A. Asian Americans in Hip-Hop,\u201d which was on view at the Chinese American Museum from May to December. Lew said he contributed a site-specific installation called \u201cShayu De Yi Nian Lai See (Year of the Shark Red Packet)\u201d for the museum\u2019s courtyard. Eighty-eight empty canvas sacks were adorned with hand-applied gold leaf paint and suspended on burlap twine with wooden clothespins. It was meant to evoke the history of Chinese immigrants in the laundry business. The number eight symbolizes prosperity and good fortune in Chinese culture.\nHow the individual bags weathered the natural elements \u2014 the canvas fraying or the paint fading and cracking in the sun \u2014 was part of an artwork about longevity, Lew said. The bags were meant to develop individual character over time, as people do.\nThe museum is part of El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, a department of the city, and is located downtown in the historic Garnier Building, the last surviving structure from L.A.\u2019s original Chinatown. The building is owned and maintained by the city, and the museum is a city entity.\nAround Dec. 7, according to the lawsuit, days before the exhibition was to end, a city maintenance crew took down the canvas bags and threw them out. According to the lawsuit, no one from the museum or El Pueblo management was there to supervise the removal of the bags. The crew may not have known the intent behind the bags and instead saw them as deteriorating objects to be discarded.\n\u201cNot being able to see these things after eight months, at the location, was gut-wrenching,\u201d Lew said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re watching the Super Bowl and they say, \u2018We\u2019re not gonna call a winner, we\u2019ll just end it in the third quarter.\u2019 There\u2019s no resolution.\u201d\nFourteen of the 88 bags were not thrown out. They had fallen down during the run of the show, Lew said, but were never reinstalled or returned to him. The lawsuit presumes the bags to be destroyed, but in response to The Times\u2019 query, the museum said the bags were put in storage.\nThe museum said it had not been informed by the city or El Pueblo that Lew\u2019s pieces would be removed that day but, perhaps more important, the museum said it did not see the bags as art in the first place.\nSeveral of the bags had been promised to Lew\u2019s collectors after the show, and others were to be sold at the museum for $88 each. The museum said the bags were merchandise hanging outdoors \u2014 courtyard decor as opposed to an official art exhibit. A vendor agreement provided to The Times by Melvin N.A. Avanzado \u2014 the attorney representing Friends of the Chinese American Museum, the nonprofit that operates the museum \u2014 specified that his client would receive 20% of the sale revenue, not unlike a consignment arrangement.\nThe museum\u2019s executive director, Michael Truong, declined to comment and referred all inquiries to Avanzado.\n\u201cWe are still reviewing the allegations,\u201d Avanzado said in an email to The Times. \u201cHowever, the Friends of the Chinese American Museum did nothing wrong with respect to the tote bags that decorated the courtyard outside the museum. I look forward to proving that the claims against my client have no merit.\u201d\nExhibition cocurator Justin Charles Hoover \u2014 who had a one-year contract at the Chinese American Museum that ended in December 2018 \u2014 said he did view the installation as art.\n\u201cWe always saw David as an artist, and we saw this as an outdoor art installation,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cThe work was always meant to weather and fade outdoors. It was meant to fall apart and be sold. Whoever took it down thought, because it was weathered, it was garbage. But I assume it was a completely innocent mistake.\u201d\nDavid Lew\u2019s lawsuit filed against the city and the Chinese American Museum, among other defendants\nThe lawsuit, filed by Les Weinstein and the law firm One llp, names the city, El Pueblo, the museum and Friends of the Chinese American Museum as defendants.\nEl Pueblo general manager Arturo Chavez declined to comment. Rob Wilcox, a representative from the office of City Attorney Mike Feuer, said staff would review the complaint and had no further comment.\nLew said he was not consulted about deinstallation of his work and found out the bags had been tossed when he received an email from cocurator Hoover on Dec. 12.\n\u201cWe have a major issue with the bags,\u201d Hoover wrote in the email. \u201cThe team that was tasked to bring the bags down from their lines thought they were to be disposed of. Like thrown out.\u201d\nHoover added: \u201cObviously we are horrified by this.\u201d\nLew said he was speechless.\n\u201cIt took months to develop the concept and measurements and diagrams and logistics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a break-up or a death: You knew this one thing, and then it leaves your life in an instant, and you\u2019re left to pick up the pieces and grieve.\u201d\nLew, who has other work in the museum\u2019s permanent collection, showed a large painting of a shark, titled \u201cQinru (Trespass),\u201d as part of the same exhibition. It was returned to him after the show, undamaged. Other artists in \u201cDon\u2019t Believe the Hype\u201d included Gajin Fujita, Hueman, Kenny Kong, Defer and Erin Yoshi. Ninochka McTaggart cocurated the exhibition.\nLew declined to give a monetary value for \u201cShayu De Yi Nian Lai See\u201d but said it was \u201cpriceless\u201d to him \u201cbecause it\u2019s part of a body of work that I can\u2019t ever, in a future retrospective setting, revisit.\u201d\nThe work also has familial value, he said. Lew\u2019s great-grandparents worked in the laundry services business after immigrating to L.A. from China in the early 1920s. He said it offended him that the bags were discarded.\nLew did not specify how much he was suing for in the lawsuit. Under the Visual Arts Rights Act, better known as VARA, the court allows for damages ranging from $750 to $30,000 per item, unless the court finds that the defendant\u2019s action was intentional. Then damages can go up to $150,000 per item.\nIn addition to suing for damages, attorney\u2019s fees and other costs related to the case, Lew is asking the court to issue an injunction preventing the city and museums under city control, such as the Italian American Museum, from taking down an exhibit without advising an artist first.\nLew\u2019s attorney, Weinstein, represented artist Kent Twitchell, who sued the federal government and the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles, among other defendants, when his 1987 mural of artist Ed Ruscha \u2014 on a Hill Street building for nearly two decades \u2014 was whitewashed in 2006 without his permission. In 2008, Twitchell won a $1.1-million settlement.\nLew said he hopes his case draws attention to perceptions about what constitutes art, what\u2019s worth saving and what\u2019s disposable.\n\u201cMost people\u2019s understanding of high art is Michelangelo,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these were American flags, how carefully would they have been placed in a pile? But these look like something we\u2019d eat fried rice off of \u2014 this can\u2019t be from a master. And sadly, the bags were thrown away like dirty laundry.\u201d"

      "text": "\"The Thinker's Burden\"\nA symbol for the INC5.2 Global Plastic Pollution Treaty negotiations\nThe Thinker\u2019s Burden is a 6-meter-tall sculptural remix of Rodin\u2019s iconic Thinker, which is being created for the INC 5.2 Global Plastics Pollution Treaty negotiations by Canadian artist Benjamin Von Wong, in collaboration with SLS Illusions.In this version, the Thinker cradles a baby, sits atop Mother Earth, and is entwined in a giant strand of DNA \u2014 the building block of life \u2014 to highlight the growing health and environmental impacts of an unregulated plastic industry on both people and planet.Crafted from papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9, wood, and steel, and covered in living vines, the sculpture will be slowly engulfed by a mounting wave of plastic waste throughout the negotiations \u2014 a visual metaphor for the toxic legacy being passed on to future generations.This piece is a public call for world leaders to finalize an ambitious treaty with legally binding obligations that addresses plastic pollution, and the health harms it causes across its entire lifecycle \u2014 before it\u2019s too late.Learn more about the health impact of plastics here.\n\u00a9Von Wong Productions 2025 - Feel free to quote and publish the photo in your online publication (please credit & link back to the original).\nThis installation is funded with the generous support of the Minderoo Foundation, Chris Larsen, Xin Liu, Canton de Gen\u00e8ve, Ville de Gen\u00e8ve, Tracy Ferron, Maggie Kaplan, Erica Berger, Katy Graham Debost, Tanya Morrow, Wendy Reed and Ocean Care.\nThe story behind our $75,000 gamble\nVideo by Manuel Gussmann\nWhat is the Global Plastics Treaty?\nMy last installation, the \"Giant Plastic Tap\" at the INC-4 Global Plastic Treaty negotiations.\nOver the past two years, delegates from 193 countries have gathered five times to work towards a legally binding Global Plastics Treaty.Despite tireless negotiations, the most recent round\u2014INC-5, held in Busan, South Korea\u2014ended without resolution. Meanwhile, the situation only worsens.In response, an additional session\u2014INC-5.2\u2014has been convened in Geneva, Switzerland, to hopefully finalize an agreement aimed at ending plastic pollution across its full lifecycle, from production to disposal.Nations remain divided into two camps:- High Ambition Countries, pushing for upstream measures, including caps on plastic production\n- Low Ambition Countries, advocating for downstream solutions like recycling and waste management.This art installation, located in the Place des Nations, right across where the treaty negotiations are happening - hopes to bridge this division by focusing on what both sides have in common: A desire to protect human health and wellbeing, not only for this generation - but for all future generations to come.\nA growing Burden\nFor the last couple of weeks, dozens of local volunteers came together with me to collect, clean, and weave together mountains of discarded plastics.\nWe wanted to make visible the burden our generation is placing on the next if we fail to get the plastic pollution crisis under control.From August 4\u201314th, as negotiations unfold, we\u2019ll keep adding plastics to the sculpture each day \u2014 a growing wave that symbolizes the rising cost of inaction.If nothing changes, plastic production is set to triple by 2050 \u2014 along with the toxic chemicals used to make and recycle it.This is why the world needs a strong and ambitious Global Plastics Treaty.\n\u00a9Von Wong Productions 2025 - Feel free to quote and publish the photo in your online publication (please credit & link back to the original).\nThis project exists because an entire community came to support it.\nOur headquarters for this project, were graciously provided to us by Glitter Gen\u00e8ve, while our material expert friends at Materiuum pointed us in the right direction to find a large variety of second-hand plastics.Papirec Gen\u00e8ve provided us with 15 cubic meters of PET and HDPE and will recycle any leftover plastics from the installation for us.Finally, our non-profit friends at Summit Foundation, Trash Hero Switzerland, SDG Solution Space, Serve the City, Regen Eden, Zero Waste Switzerland, Zero Waste Geneva, Geneva Environmental Network, Gallifrey Foundation, Plastic Free Campus, Green Earth Action Foundation, Corde Cafe, and TannEco helped us to collect both trash and volunteers to make this project possible!Once this project is complete, our international non-profit partners will amplify this project far and wide; UNHCR, 5 Gyres, Plastic Pollution Coalition, Oceanic Preservation Society, As You Sow, Habitable, World Resources Institute, A Plastic Planet, Geneva Environmental Network, UN Environment Programme, Oceanic Global, Break Free From Plastics, UN Today, Gallifrey Foundation, Greenpeace, and Ocean Care.\nAdditional ways of donating and contributing to the project here\nHave any ideas?\nThis art installation becomes more powerful the more people see it and talk about it!

      "text": "- Share via\nEighteen months later, Anna Holland still can\u2019t stomach the smell of tomato soup.\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a tin of it anymore,\u201d said the climate activist, who shocked the art world \u2014 and much of the rest of the planet \u2014 by throwing Heinz Tomato Soup at Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d in the National Gallery in London in October 2022.\nHolland and fellow protester Phoebe Plummer carefully chose the Heinz for its bright orange hue \u2014 the same used in Just Stop Oil\u2019s international branding \u2014 to symbolize \u201chope for a brighter future\u201d in the Post-Impressionist painting.\n\u201cWe used soup in particular because it would capture the media\u2019s attention,\u201d said Holland, a member of Just Stop Oil. \u201cIt holds the conversation for longer. It gets people to ask questions like, \u2018Why soup?\u2019\u201d\nThe splashy stunt has held the world\u2019s attention like no climate action before, cementing the movement\u2019s commitment to artistic vandalism. It\u2019s a form of protest first popularized by early 20th century suffragettes \u2014 in 1914, Mary Richardson used a meat cleaver to slash Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s \u201cRokeby Venus\u201d in London\u2019s National Gallery \u2014 only to fall out of fashion shortly thereafter.\nNow it\u2019s back.\nIn 2022 alone, protesters threw black goo on a Klimt, mashed potatoes on a Monet, and cake at the Mona Lisa. They glued themselves to an art-history survey course\u2019s worth of priceless works, from Picasso to Raphael to Botticelli. Not even Warhol\u2019s famous soup cans were spared. Further assaults followed in 2023 and 2024, including a hammer attack on the aforementioned Vel\u00e1zquez and Just Stop Oil\u2019s orange dye strike on Stonehenge, the mysterious 5,000-year-old monument in England.\nA movement long defined by shaggy hippies encamped in old-growth redwoods and Indigenous protesters chained to construction equipment was remade in the image of two nonbinary university students wielding cans of tomato soup.\nEqually unexpected, climate activists have managed to maintain their museum monopoly even as combative public protests have spilled into the mainstream.\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be significant, but we had no idea it was going to be as big as it was,\u201d said Holland. \u201cWe sort of claimed that tactic in a way, so [the public] associate it with the climate movement.\u201d\nAll of which raises the question: What\u2019s the message in the medium?\n\u201cPeople asked me many times, \u2018Why did the activists target a painting? Why didn\u2019t they target the fossil fuel infrastructure?\u2019\u201d said Margaret Klein Salamon, executive director of the Climate Emergency Fund and author of \u201cFacing the Climate Emergency: How to Transform Yourself With Climate Truth.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very frustrating complaint, because Just Stop Oil [protesters] had been arrested hundreds of times blocking fossil fuel sites, and it was barely reported,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why they threw soup.\u201d (The Climate Emergency Fund is Just Stop Oil\u2019s primary financial backer.)\nIn Klein Salamon\u2019s view, and that of many others, the target is irrelevant. Attention is the purpose. Outrage is the goal. If pressed, some argue the indignation over the defacement itself betrays how little our culture values the planet when compared to inanimate works of canvas and pigment.\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking the risk of potentially going to prison because the government values a painting and a frame over your life and the lives of all of us,\u201d Holland explained. \u201cIt shows the government cares more about material things than human lives.\u201d\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no role for art to play in the climate crisis \u2014 at least, not according to the art world. Grantmakers such as the Frankenthaler Climate Initiative now explicitly fund climate-focused works, while several prominent art museums have made public commitments to showcase them.\n\u201cThe climate crisis is something that truly terrifies me, and also fascinates me as a subject,\u201d said artist Josh Kline, whose new show, \u201cJosh Kline: Climate Change,\u201d opened in June at the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cThere\u2019s very little contemporary art that deals with the climate crisis. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I started making this work.\u201d\nThe work in question is a \u201csuite of science-fiction installations\u201d, spanning roughly five years\u2019 worth of material. It was supported in part by MoCA\u2019s Environmental Council, a first-of-its-kind initiative to transform museum operations and support artists addressing the climate crisis in their work.\n\u201cWe started to place a higher premium on artists working on issues of climate change,\u201d said curator Rebecca Lowery. \u201cMost viewers will readily recognize the theme of the exhibition and come away thinking about what we can collectively do to avoid this future.\u201d\nAt the heart of the showcase is an immersive sculpture series called \u201cPersonal Responsibility,\u201d made up of tents and other makeshift shelters, whose \u201cinhabitants\u201d \u2014 projections of actors playing future climate refugees \u2014 narrate their experience of the coming disaster.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need me to tell them that the climate crisis is happening \u2014 that\u2019s really what scientists are for,\u201d Kline said. \u201cWhat I as an artist can do ... is help make it personal for them.\u201d\nOn this, Holland agrees.\n\u201cProtest is driven by art,\u201d they said. \u201cOne of the reasons the climate movement isn\u2019t as big as it could be is because it\u2019s easy to intellectually connect with the climate crisis \u2014 what\u2019s not easy is emotionally connecting.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what art does,\u201d Holland continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the first step to being able to take action.\u201d\nFor some, the natural conclusion of this argument is that museums and other cultural centers should be spared, invited into the conversation rather than made the soapbox for it.\n\u201cI think protest is a vital form of civic participation, and I want to honor that,\u201d said Devon Bella of Art + Climate Action, a Bay Area-based collective working toward sustainability in the arts. \u201cBut in terms of climate activism, there\u2019s also a lot of work that needs to be done in local communities,\u201d work that is often less glamorous and more sustained than a brief, symbolic attack on a beloved painting or sculpture.\nUnsurprisingly, the Assn. of Art Museum Directors, an industry group, takes an even more stringent view.\n\u201cAttacks on works of art cannot be justified, whether the motivations are political, religious, or cultural,\u201d it announced in response to the soup action. \u201cSuch protests are misdirected, and the ends do not justify the means.\u201d\nEqually unsurprising, activists say that\u2019s a cop-out.\n\u201cNo one likes to be shaken awake \u2014 it\u2019s very uncomfortable, and people get very angry at the activists,\u201d Klein Salamon said. \u201cBut normalcy, which includes things like sports and plays and art, is actually incredibly dangerous at this time.\u201d\nIn this worldview, art about the climate crisis is at best irrelevant, and, at worst, counterproductive to the direct action necessary to stop it.\n\u201cI want to distinguish joining the climate protest movement from what most people still think of as climate action,\u201d a.k.a. recycling your Amazon packages and toting a reusable bag to Whole Foods, the activist Klein Salamon went on. \u201cWhere we need to go is truly mass protest, hundreds of thousands of people getting in the street, occupying buildings, taking up nonviolent civil disobedience.\u201d\nJosh Kline, the artist, holds a similar view.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this displacement of responsibility,\u201d he said of the current conversation around climate change. \u201cInstead of saying, \u2018We need structural change, we need governmental change, we need change in the political system,\u2019 [we say] \u2018It\u2019s your responsibility as an individual to spend hours sorting your plastic and recycling.\u2019\u201d\nOthers argue that the art industry itself shares complicity in the crisis, even as artists and museumgoers are largely aligned in their desire to confront it.\n\u201cArt throughout history has been intrinsically connected to wealth and finance,\u201d said L.A.-based artist Sayre Gomez, whose paintings of Los Angeles highlight destruction and decay. \u201c[But] artists and activism overlaps in most cases. It\u2019s artists typically who are aligning with the spirit of protest. So there is a bit of a double-edged sword there.\u201d\nAlthough their methods may be different, both the activists and the artists agree they are locked in an arms race to keep public attention on the emergency unfolding before them.\nAnd that\u2019s where soup may finally be losing steam.\nEven Klein Salamon acknowledged that, 18 months after \u201cSunflowers,\u201d the effect of political vandalism may be wearing off. Nothing shocks in perpetuity \u2014 not \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d or \u201cPiss Christ\u201d or \u201cPink Flamingos.\u201d Like the art it defaces, protest must evolve to stay relevant.\n\u201cSomething that works once or twice or three times doesn\u2019t work forever,\u201d Klein Salamon said. \u201cIt loses its shock.\u201d"

      "text": "Why Biden should lead the charge on the global plastics treaty at the G7 Summit\n- Share via\nIt has been described as the next great frontier in environmental reform. With the Group of 7 meeting set to begin Friday, momentum is building for a global treaty to combat the plastic pollution that is destroying ecosystems and posing a mounting threat to human and environmental health. More than two-thirds of United Nations member states have declared support for a global plastics treaty. Yet one critical nation has remained silent: the United States.\nTo understand why, look to the entrenched power of Big Oil and Gas in Washington.\nAs the world turns away from fossil fuels, oil and gas giants, and their petrochemical partners, are staking their future on plastic production, with plans to invest at least $400 billion in plastics by 2024. The petrochemicals used to make plastic are rapidly becoming the world\u2019s biggest driver of oil demand \u2014 ahead of trucks, aviation and shipping. With more than 600 lobbyists in Washington, oil and gas companies are deploying historic amounts of cash to block meaningful international action, all while positioning themselves as leaders in sustainability.\nIt appears to be working. Plastics are conspicuously missing from President Biden\u2019s climate agenda. Much is riding on whether the Biden administration can overcome industry pressure. From the deepest trenches of the ocean to the most remote locations on land, few habitats remain unspoiled by plastic. The U.N. agency UNESCO estimates that plastic pollution kills at least 100,000 marine mammals and a million seabirds every year. The harm to fish, which is only just beginning to be measured, is likely far greater.\nOn the economic front, plastic pollution is causing losses between $6 billion and $19 billion a year in 87 coastal countries. Most insidious of all are the microplastics shed by polluted materials. These particles are now found in every part of the food chain, including in salt and honey.\nAs Big Oil and Gas scale up their plastic production, the problem is set to get much worse. Right now, a dump truck\u2019s worth of plastic enters the ocean every minute, but this is expected to triple by 2040. The United States will be responsible for an outsized share of it. By some measures, we are already the worst plastic polluter in the world.\nIf the Biden administration is to follow through on its pledge to reestablish the U.S. as an environmental champion, it must lead the charge for a treaty to curtail not just plastic waste, but also spiraling virgin plastic production.\nThe effort already enjoys broad support, and not just from U.N. member states. Break Free From Plastic is an advocacy group made up of thousands of organizations across the globe including the Environmental Investigation Agency, where I work. The group regards a global treaty as \u201cthe only viable and effective means to tackle plastic pollution.\u201d\nMeanwhile, major brands such as Coca-Cola, Pepisco, Nestl\u00e9 and Unilever, whose reputations take a hit every time a cast-off bottle or plastic wrapper is found with their logo on it, see a global treaty as driving \u201cthe transition to a circular economy for plastic \u2014 at speed and scale.\u201d But breaking the fossil fuel industry\u2019s stranglehold on U.S. policymaking will be no easy task.\nAs an NPR investigation found last year, the industry has spent years successfully promoting the myth that recycling is the answer to plastic pollution. The popularization of recycling, it turns out, was largely an industry-funded interference campaign. All the while, not one of the 100 biggest plastic producers source more than 2% of their feedstock from recycled material. Their overproduction of new plastic also undermines recycling markets.\nThe silver lining? The fossil fuel industry\u2019s lobbying push is a sign of how entirely plausible bipartisan support for a plastics treaty has become. Even in a historically divided Congress, action on plastics enjoys wide-ranging support, with conservative stalwarts such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) helping to spearhead a bill to protect oceans from plastic pollution.\nWhile the exact agenda at this weekend\u2019s G-7 conference is unknown, a treaty on plastics will likely be on the docket. This will put Biden on the spot. He should join other G-7 leaders in formally supporting the start of treaty negotiations at the U.N. Environment Assembly in February. The G-7 should be clear that the agreement must address the full life cycle of plastics, starting with restrictions on virgin plastic production, similar to the approach taken in the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, a 1987 international agreement that set deadlines for stopping production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and similar chemicals.\nIt remains to be seen whether Biden will show the leadership necessary to overcome the lobbying blitz from oil and gas companies and back meaningful action on reducing plastic production and waste. But for a president who is striving to return the United States to its rightful position as a climate leader, supporting this treaty is an opportunity for the ages.\nTim Grabiel is the senior lawyer for the Environmental Investigation Agency."

  "argos_summary": "Canadian artist Benjamin Von Wong created a large sculpture titled \"Thinker's Burden\" in front of the United Nations in Geneva to raise awareness about plastic pollution as nations negotiate a global treaty to combat it. The nearly 18-foot sculpture, which depicts a figure cradling a baby and surrounded by plastic waste, serves as a visual reminder of the urgent need for action against plastic pollution. As negotiations progress, Von Wong continues to add plastic waste to the sculpture, symbolizing the growing burden of inaction on future generations.",
