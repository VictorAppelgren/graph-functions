  "content": "Following the announcement of Apple's upcoming \"Awe dropping\" event, on this week's episode of The MacRumors Show we talk through all of the new accessories rumored to debut alongside the iPhone 17 lineup.\n\nWe take a closer look at Apple's invite for \"Awe dropping;\" the design could hint at the \u200ciPhone 17\u200c's new thermal system with vapor chamber cooling and a more heat-conductive aluminum chassis. The orange and blue also likely hints at the purported orange color option for the iPhone 17 Pro and the blue color finish for the iPhone 17 Air\n\nNew \"Liquid Silicone\" cases are rumored to debut alongside the \u200ciPhone 17\u200c, as well as more premium \"TechWoven\" cases. TechWoven is expected to take the place of Apple's previous FineWoven and leather cases, but with improved durability. The \u200ciPhone 17 Air\u200c could also get a Smart Battery and an iPhone 4-style bumper case. All of the new cases are expected to feature support for a \"Crossbody Strap,\" a new magnetic lanyard accessory.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3 could arrive at the event. The new model is expected to feature heart-rate monitoring, improved active noise cancellation, tweaked earbuds, and a slightly smaller charging case with a hidden capacitive pairing button. The \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c may also offer reverse wireless charging for AirPods.\n\nThe MacRumors Show has its own YouTube channel, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.\n\nYou can also listen to \u200cThe MacRumors Show\u200c on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also copy our RSS feed directly into your podcast player.\n\nIf you haven't already listened to the previous episode of The MacRumors Show, catch up to hear our discussion about what to expect from the Apple Watch SE 3, Series 11, and Ultra 3, and whether it's worth holding off on an upgrade until next year.\n\nSubscribe to \u200cThe MacRumors Show\u200c for new episodes every week, where we discuss some of the topical news breaking here on MacRumors, often joined by interesting guests such as Kevin Nether, John Gruber, Mark Gurman, Jon Prosser, Luke Miani, Matthew Cassinelli, Brian Tong, Quinn Nelson, Jared Nelson, Eli Hodapp, Mike Bell, Sara Dietschy, iJustine, Jon Rettinger, Andru Edwards, Arnold Kim, Ben Sullins, Marcus Kane, Christopher Lawley, Frank McShan, David Lewis, Tyler Stalman, Sam Kohl, Federico Viticci, Thomas Frank, Jonathan Morrison, Ross Young, Ian Zelbo, and Rene Ritchie.\n\n\u200cThe MacRumors Show\u200c is on X @MacRumorsShow, so be sure to give us a follow to keep up with the podcast.

      "text": "Bloomberg's Mark Gurman joins us on this week's episode of The MacRumors Show to discuss the controversy surrounding Apple Intelligence, what to expect from iOS 19, and more.\nWith the context of his insider knowledge, Mark gives us his thoughts on Apple's recent announcement that it is further delaying the major Siri Apple Intelligence features that it expected to release as part of iOS 18. He gives us a sense of the scale of the crisis and when to expect the remaining features to arrive. We also discuss his recent report about a significant internal reshuffle to move Siri from artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea to Vision Pro chief Mike Rockwell.\nWe delve into the complete redesign rumored for iOS 19, which is believed to be part of a wider push to bring a visionOS-style design language to all of Apple's major platforms. It is expected to be the biggest redesign of the iPhone's software since iOS 7. Mark tells us what users are likely to make of the update and why Apple is devoting so much energy to the redesign amid the problems with Apple Intelligence. He also tells us about the sort of new Apple Intelligence features to expect in iOS 19 and the plan to progressively improve Siri through to iOS 20.\nWe discuss why the delay in releasing the remaining Apple Intelligence features has delayed the company's long-rumored smart home hub product and the experience it is expected to offer when it launches later this year. We also touch on Apple's problems with allocating developer resources, iPhone 17-exclusive Apple Intelligence features, whether Apple is doing enough to course-correct on AI, Apple TV+ viewing habits, and more.\nSee more of Mark's work on Bloomberg and follow him on X @markgurman.

      "text": "YouTuber Kevin Nether joins us on this week's episode of The MacRumors Show to discuss Apple's latest updates to its array of Pro apps and the acquisition of Pixelmator.\nApple this week released a series of updates for its Pro apps, including Logic Pro 11.1, Logic Pro for iPad 2.1, Final Cut Pro 11, Final Cut Pro for iPad 2.1, and Final Cut Camera 1.1. Most notably, the latest version of Final Cut Pro for the Mac includes spatial video editing support and AI-driven features such as Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions.\nEarlier this month, Pixelmator, the company behind popular photo and image editing apps Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator, announced that it is being acquired by Apple. The apps are exclusive to Apple platforms with a focus on user experience and one-off purchasing, unlike many of their rivals. Pixelmator is designed to be a challenger to Adobe Photoshop, while Photomator is a Lightroom competitor.\nBoth Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro were Apple acquisitions, so it's possible that Pixelmator and Photomator may become the next Apple Pro apps with a focus on image editing. It could also fold some of their features into the Photos app. While Apple used to offer a Lightroom competitor called Aperture, it discontinued the app just over a decade ago, and it has never made a Photoshop rival. What exactly Apple will do with the acquisition remains to be seen, but the Pixelmator team has teased \"exciting updates to come.\"\nSee more of Kevin's work over on his YouTube channel \"Kevin The Tech Ninja.\" The MacRumors Show also has its own YouTube channel, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:\nYou can also listen to The MacRumors Show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also copy our RSS feed directly into your podcast player.\nIf you haven't already listened to the previous episode of The MacRumors Show, catch up for our discussion about visionOS 2.2 and Apple's potential move into iPhone-connected glasses.\nSubscribe to The MacRumors Show for new episodes every week, where we discuss some of the topical news breaking here on MacRumors, often joined by interesting guests such as Jon Prosser, Luke Miani, Matthew Cassinelli, Brian Tong, Quinn Nelson, Jared Nelson, Eli Hodapp, Mike Bell, Sara Dietschy, iJustine, Jon Rettinger, Andru Edwards, Arnold Kim, Ben Sullins, Marcus Kane, Christopher Lawley, Frank McShan, David Lewis, Tyler Stalman, Sam Kohl, John Gruber, Federico Viticci, Thomas Frank, Jonathan Morrison, Ross Young, Ian Zelbo, and Rene Ritchie.\nThe MacRumors Show is on X @MacRumorsShow, so be sure to give us a follow to keep up with the podcast.

      "text": "Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models could include a reverse wireless charging feature making them capable of delivering power to other Apple devices, according to the Weibo-based leaker Fixed Focus Digital.\nThe Chinese leaker says that Apple has tested reverse wireless charging for the company's new high-end smartphones, but whether the feature is actually enabled when the devices launch next month remains to be seen.\nThis is the second time we've heard about the feature potentially coming to new iPhones this year. In February, Weibo leaker Instant Digital claimed that Apple had been testing 7.5W reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, saying it could be used to charge other Apple accessories like AirPods, Apple Watch, or potentially an upcoming MagSafe Battery Pack.\nLong-running rumors of iPhone reverse wireless charging capabilities finally came to fruition in 2021 \u2013 albeit in a limited way \u2013 when Apple released the MagSafe Battery Pack for iPhone 12 and newer models. When attached to an iPhone that was charging via Lightning, the iPhone could deliver power to the MagSafe Battery Pack, which was the first instance of an iPhone being able to route power to an accessory device.\nApple discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack in September 2023 with the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup, which dropped the Lightning cable in favor of USB-C. iPhone 15 and later models can reverse charge Apple Watch, AirPods, and other smaller devices that support Power Delivery at up to 4.5 watts via the USB-C port, but the wireless reverse charging feature for Apple devices has not been implemented since the discontinuation of the MagSafe Battery Pack.\nIn 2022, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that a relaunched MagSafe Battery Pack would eventually transition to USB-C, but that has yet to happen. Likewise, In September 2023, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman also said he expected USB-C versions of the MagSafe Battery Pack to return \"eventually.\" But he qualified that by saying \"Don't hold your breath.\"\nAll will be revealed when Apple releases its iPhone 17 lineup around mid-September, with an iPhone event rumored to be taking place on Tuesday, September 9. Would you welcome a reverse wireless charging feature? Let us know in the comments."

In 2017, Apple acquired Workflow and, the following year, it was rebranded as \"Shortcuts.\" Shortcuts have since become a key part of Apple's ecosystem and can be used for a huge range of powerful, automated actions. Matthew was present at Workflow throughout its transition to Apple and now offers his own library of complex Shortcuts, which you can access over on his website.\nLast year, a report from The Information claimed that iOS 18 will introduce some major AI features to Siri and the Shortcuts app. Apple apparently wants Siri to be able to help users automate complex, multi-step tasks with voice-based commands and have much deeper integration with Shortcuts, such as by potentially helping users build them.\nWe break down Apple Shortcuts for beginners and look at some of the many use-cases for the app, as well as consider where it could go next with AI.

      "text": "The 2025 iPhone 17 Air\nContents\nWith the September 9 iPhone event, Apple will introduce an ultra thin \"iPhone 17 Air,\" marking the first notable redesign to the iPhone's form factor in several years. iPhone 17 Air is just a placeholder name, and we don't know what Apple will call the new device, but multiple rumors have confirmed Apple's work on a super thin iPhone.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be around 5.5mm thick, and at 5.5mm, it will be the thinnest iPhone released to date. That measurement doesn't include the area with the camera bump, which could be thicker to accommodate the single 48-megapixel rear camera rumored for the device.\nApple will sell the iPhone 17 Air alongside the standard iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max. We are not expecting an iPhone 17 Plus this year, with the iPhone 17 Air effectively replacing it in the lineup. Early rumors suggested the iPhone 17 Air could be as expensive or more expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro, but more recent information suggests it will cost more than the iPhone 17 but won't be as expensive as the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. That suggests we could see a price point around $899, similar to the current iPhone 16 Plus.\nIn terms of size, rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, which will put it in between the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max in size. As mentioned, it will have a single-lens rear camera, and Apple could be planning for a horizontal bar-like camera bump at the back, a design feature that's also rumored for the Pro iPhones.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 120Hz ProMotion display, and it will be equipped with Apple's C1 5G modem. Other features will include an A19 chip, Wi-Fi 7, and a more advanced display material that can better hold up to drops and scratches. There will be some small design changes to accommodate the device's thin chassis, such as a USB-C port that's not entirely centered, and fewer speaker holes.\nApple plans to market the iPhone 17 Air with a focus on design rather than internal specs. It won't have the top-of-the-line components or the fastest chip like the iPhone 17 Pro models, but the fresh design may be appealing to customers.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\nWith the 2024 iPad Pro launch, Apple slimmed down the chassis, and the 12.9-inch model is just 5.1mm thick. It's Apple's thinnest device ever, and now Apple is aiming to follow it up with a super thin and light iPhone.\nWe've heard several rumors about the iPhone 17 Air, and thickness estimates have ranged from 5mm to a little over 6mm. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, for example, thinks that the iPhone 17 Air will be around two millimeters thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick, so an iPhone 17 that's 2mm thinner would come in at around 6.25mm. 6.25mm would make the iPhone 17 Air the thinnest iPhone to date, but some rumors think it will be even thinner.\nThe Information believes the iPhone 17 Air will be around 6mm thick, while Jeff Pu thinks it will be 6mm thick. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which likely means it will have a 5.5mm chassis with a thicker area for the rear camera bump. Dummy models that have surfaced are approximately 5.5mm thick.\nThe thinnest iPhone to date was the iPhone 6, which measured in at 6.9mm. iPhones got thicker with the iPhone X and beyond, because Apple changed device thickness to provide more space for the battery, camera lenses, Face ID hardware, and more. The iPhone 17 Air could be 9.5mm thick at the camera bump end, which means we can expect the camera bump to be notably thicker than the rest of the device.\nApple might use a titanium-aluminum frame for the iPhone 17 Air, with the device using more titanium than the current Pro iPhones. Rumors suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will weigh in at 145 grams. That would make it similar in weight to the iPhone SE 2 or the iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively. Titanium could help ensure that the iPhone frame resists bending while also keeping the device lightweight.\nConceptual renderings of the iPhone 17 Air provide insight into what the device is expected to look like. Mockups, renders, and dummy models feature a device with a slim, 5.5mm profile and a thicker rear camera bar with single-lens camera. Apple hasn't implemented a horizontal camera bar before, so this will be a significant design change. The iPhone 17 Pro models are also expected to have a camera bar.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, which Apple chose because it was worried anything larger might be susceptible to bending. Apple initially planned on a 6.9-inch screen size for the device, but it was sized down to prevent any potential bending issues.\nRumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will feature a \"glass section\" around the logo that's integrated into an \"overall metal chassis,\" which has previously been described as a half aluminum, half glass build. The design can be seen in some renderings and iPhone 17 Air dummy models.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have some subtle design changes so that all of the internal components can fit despite the thinness of the chassis. Dummy models suggest that the USB-C port on the bottom edge won't be centered front to back, and will instead be shifted closer to the rear of the device.\nThe speaker grilles have also been simplified, with just two holes on either side of the port rather than the typical five.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will include MagSafe charging, a Camera Control button, and an Action Button, based on dummy models of the device that have been circulating.\nA closer look at the thin design of the iPhone 17 Air can be seen in a video that shows off an iPhone 17 Air dummy model. Dummy models are often an accurate representation of what we can expect, as they are created for case makers based on leaked information from Apple's suppliers.\nA screen protector designed for the iPhone 17 Air based on leaked design dimensions suggests that the front camera of the device might be located on the left of the Dynamic Island, rather than on the right like the iPhone 16 models.\nColors\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be available in black, white, light gold, and light blue. The blue shade is rumored to be a very light blue similar to the blue that Apple used for the MacBook Air.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple has considered creating a bumper case designed for the iPhone 17 Air. The case would feature protection for the edges of the device, but would not cover the back. Apple last released a bumper case alongside the iPhone 4 in 2010. For the iPhone 17 Air, a bumper case would offer some protection without impacting the thin design of the device.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nDisplay\nThe iPhone 17 Air is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display, which means it will be larger than the iPhone 17 but smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. There have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to use the same OLED panel as the current iPhone 16 Pro models, which is sourced from Samsung. The panel has a 30 percent increase in brightness and improved longevity compared to the prior-generation iPhone 16 display.\nThe entire iPhone 17 lineup is could get 120Hz ProMotion display technology, which means it will no longer be a feature limited to the Pro lineup. ProMotion displays will be enabled by the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels that Apple plans to use for all of the iPhone 17 models. LTPO allows for 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rates, and adds always-on display support.\nWhile multiple rumors have suggested ProMotion display capabilities will expand to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, a Chinese leaker believes that's partially inaccurate. The leaker says that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will get 120Hz displays, but that the displays will not support adaptive refresh rates down to 1Hz.\nA 120Hz panel would allow for smoother scrolling, animations, and UI transitions, but it would not allow for always-on display functionality.\nThere were rumors that some iPhone 17 models were going to be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating, but it sounds like that might not happen this year after all. Apple ran into issues scaling up its display coating process, and it was too slow when taking into account millions of devices, so the coating plan was scrapped.\nHints of the iPhone 17 Air were found in the iOS 26 beta. There is a wallpaper for a display that has a 1260 x 2736 resolution, but that doesn't correspond to any existing iPhone models. It is, however, a resolution that would work for a 6.6-inch display.\nNaming\nWe don't know what Apple is going to call its ultra thin iPhone. Rumors have referred to it as the \"iPhone 17 Slim\" or the \"iPhone 17 Air,\" but neither name is official.\nGiven that Apple has an iPad Air and an iPad Pro and a MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro, the iPhone \"Air\" naming might make the most sense to Apple customers.\nA-Series Chip\nApple is working on A19 and A19 Pro chips for the iPhone 17 lineup, and the iPhone 17 Air will get one of those two options. Some rumors suggest it will get the A19 alongside the iPhone 17, but it could also feature the A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core than the A19 Pro used in the iPhone 17 Pro.\nRumors suggest that all iPhone 17 models will have a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance. Vapor chambers work by spreading headtevenly across a larger area, reducing thermal throttling and ensuring consistent performance.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to have 12GB RAM, which would put it on par with the iPhone 17 Pro models. Current iPhone 16 models have 8GB RAM, the minimum for Apple Intelligence.\nCamera\nWith limited internal space due to the slimmed down design, the iPhone 17 Air will get just a single-lens rear camera. Rumors suggest it will use the same 48-megapixel Wide camera that's in the iPhone 16 models. If the iPhone 17 Air only has a single-lens rear camera, it will not be capable of capturing spatial video or spatial photos unless Apple has a new technique in mind for capturing this kind of content.\nAll iPhone models coming in 2025 are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nConnectivity\nApple-Designed 5G Modem Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be one of the first iPhones that will use an Apple-designed 5G modem chip. Apple's modem will be capable of theoretical 5G download speeds of up to 4Gb/s, which is slower than Qualcomm modems in current iPhones. The chip also won't support the fastest mmWave 5G, and it will be limited to sub-6GHz speeds.\nFor other iPhone 17 models, Apple plans to continue to use Qualcomm chips. It's just the iPhone 17 Air that will get the Apple chip.\nSIM Tray\nApple will remove the physical SIM slot in iPhones sold in more countries next year, though it is not yet clear which countries. U.S. iPhone models haven't included a SIM tray since the iPhone 14, but Apple has continued using it in other countries.\nThe iPhone 17 Air may be too thin to support a SIM tray.\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\nBattery\nWith the iPhone Air featuring a chassis that's just 5.5mm thick, there will be less room for the battery. Apple is optimizing battery life with the more efficient C1 modem, processor improvements, and a higher-density battery that could use silicon-anode battery technology, but there could still be a hit to battery life.\nAccording to The Information, the iPhone 17 Air will have \"worse\" battery life compared to other iPhones. Apple's internal testing has apparently found that 60 to 70 percent of iPhone 17 Air users will be able to go a full day without charging, while that number is 80 to 90 percent for other iPhone models.\nThe iPhone 17 Air could have a 2,800mAh battery, which would be similar to the battery that Apple used in the iPhone 12. A second rumor says the battery will be under 3,000mAh, and a third suggests Apple will use a 2,900mAh battery.\nAlleged images of the iPhone 17 Air's battery suggest that it will be half as thin as the battery designed for the iPhone 17 Pro. It supposedly measures in at 2.49mm thick, which would take up just under half the thickness of the device if the iPhone 17 Air is 5.5mm thick as rumored.\nCharging\nApple is planning to release an iPhone battery case alongside the iPhone 17 Air that will add extra battery capacity, but it will mean that iPhone 17 Air users who need more battery will have to compromise on thickness.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support up to 35W wired charging speeds, which means there would be no change from the current charging maximum.\nThe iPhone 17 models could support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be priced at $899, which is the current price for the iPhone 16 Plus. At $899, the iPhone 17 Air would be more expensive than the iPhone 17, but less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\niPhone 17 Air Launch Date\nApple's 2025 iPhone-centric event will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday, September 9. Pre-orders may follow on September 12, with a launch to happen on Friday, September 19.\nWhat's Next for the iPhone Air\nApple is already planning for the next few iPhone Air models, and the company plans to introduce an iPhone 19 Air with a larger display in the second half of 2027. The iPhone 18 Air coming in 2026 will be the same size as the iPhone 17 Air coming in September.\nA future version of the iPhone Air could use an upgraded LTPO3 OLED display that uses far less battery power. Apple could introduce this technology by 2027, resulting in iPhones that have longer battery life."

      "text": "Apple's logo for its upcoming September 9 event hints at two rumored iPhone 17 Pro features, including new color options and a vapor chamber cooling system.\nOf course, this is all just speculation for fun, as we count down the final days until the event.\nNew Colors\nLast month, Macworld's Filipe Esp\u00f3sito reported that orange and dark blue would be two out of the five color options available for the iPhone 17 Pro models. Fittingly, the event's logo contains orange and dark blue hues, which could be a hint.\nHere are all five color options rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models:\nBlack\nWhite\nGray\nDark Blue\nOrange\nVapor Chamber Cooling System\nSecond, it is rumored that all of the iPhone 17 models will feature internal design changes for improved heat dissipation, with the iPhone 17 Pro models in particular rumored to feature a vapor chamber cooling system. The event logo looks like an infrared heat map outputted by a thermal camera, which could be a hint.\nA vapor chamber would help to prevent the iPhone 17 Pro models from overheating during intensive, sustained tasks like gaming. It would consist of a thin, sealed metal chamber containing a small amount of liquid. When the iPhone heats up, the liquid would turn to vapor and dissipate across the chamber's surface area.

      "text": "YouTuber and electric vehicle expert Ben Sullins joins us on this week's episode of The MacRumors Show to talk through all of the latest rumors and expectations around the Apple Car.\nApple initially intended its electric vehicle to have many unique design features, including no steering wheel or brake pedal, and inward-facing seats in a limousine-like configuration, but the company has since scaled back its ambitions. Now, the car is expected to have a more traditional design with a driver's seat, steering wheel, and conventional pedals. It was also planned to start at around $120,000 with full-self driving functionality, but now Apple is aiming for a sub-$100,000 price point with only limited autonomous driving capabilities on highways. Apple is purportedly aiming to launch the vehicle around 2026.\nWe discuss what Ben expects from the Apple Car's identity, unique selling points, driving style, and go-to-market strategy. Ben analyzes where the vehicle is likely to be positioned and its sub-$100,000 price point, and whether it can compete with Tesla's offerings. We also discuss autonomous driving functionality and where the broader electric vehicle market will be by the time Apple's car launches, how Tesla is likely to respond, and more. See more of Ben's work over on his YouTube channel.\nListen to The MacRumors Show in Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Pocket Casts, Castro, Google Podcasts, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also copy our RSS feed directly into your podcast player.

      "text": "Display analyst Ross Young joins us on The MacRumors Show podcast this week to discuss some of his biggest leaks about Apple's plans for the next year and beyond.\nRoss is co-founder and CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), a leading display market research firm, and has worked throughout the display supply chain. Ross is one of the top sources of information about Apple's plans and has a huge amount of influence on the rumors space, having revealed a plethora of accurate insights about upcoming Apple devices. See some of Ross's rumors that panned out correctly below:\n- The iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max will feature OLED displays that are 5.4-, 6.1-, and 6.7-inches in size respectively, with no ProMotion technology.\n- The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max will be the first iPhones to include ProMotion displays.\n- The iPhone SE 3 will continue to feature a 4.7-inch display and launch in 2022.\n- The sixth-generation iPad mini 6 will have an 8.3-inch display with slimmer bezels and no Home Button. He also noted that it would not feature ProMotion.\n- Redesigned MacBook Pro models will feature 14- and 16-inch displays with ProMotion for refresh rates up to 120Hz.\n- Redesigned MacBook Air will feature a 13.6-inch display with no ProMotion or mini-LED technology.\nLooking to forecasts for the future, Ross believes:\n- 2022's 11-inch iPad Pro will not have a mini-LED display.\n- The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will feature slightly larger displays with a \"pill and hole-punch\" design replacing the notch.\n- The standard iPhone 14 models will not gain ProMotion.\n- The Apple Watch Series 8 will come in three sizes. An additional model with a 1.99-inch display will join the lineup.\n- Apple is planning to launch a 27-inch mini-LED external display.\n- Apple's mixed-reality headset will feature three displays, including two micro OLED displays along with an AMOLED display.\n- In early 2023, Apple will launch an iPad with a 14.1-inch display. It is unlikely to feature ProMotion.\n- Apple may launch a fourth-generation iPhone SE with a 5.7-inch display in 2023 or 2024.\n- Apple is preparing to launch a MacBook Air or \"MacBook\" with a 15.2-inch display in 2023.\n- The \"pill and hole-punch\" TrueDepth camera array design will replace the notch on all iPhone 15 models.\n- Apple is planning to launch 13-inch MacBook Air, 11-inch iPad Pro, and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models with OLED displays in 2024.\n- The \"iPhone 16 Pro\" models will integrate Face ID under the display, before expanding to all models with the \"iPhone 17\" lineup in 2025.\n- Apple has likely delayed its foldable iPhone to 2025.\n- 2026's \"iPhone 18 Pro\" models will integrate both the Face ID system and the front-facing camera under the display.\n- Apple is exploring all-screen foldable notebooks that could launch around 2026 or 2027.\nHe has also commented on how the iPad mini 7 is unlikely to feature a ProMotion display, and has expressed skepticism about Apple launching a new 12-inch MacBook.\nIn this episode, we take a look at some of Ross's biggest leaks and rumors for the year ahead, including details about Apple's plans for larger Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook Air models. We also delve into the rumored mini-LED external display, as well as long-term progress toward Apple under-display technology and foldables.\nRoss gives us some insight into his background, work, and fascinating relationship with Apple over the years.

      "text": "On this week's episode of The MacRumors Show, Snazzy Labs' Quinn Nelson joins us to talk about the first week using Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro headset.\nNow that they each have one, Quinn and Dan discuss whether the Vision Pro meets their expectations. A significant portion of our dialogue is dedicated to the technical aspects of the Vision Pro, including its display quality, brightness, and the challenges users might face with hand gestures and text selection. The conversation progresses to evaluate the device's text sharpness, its implications for productivity, and how comfortable it feels with the two headband options.\nAn interesting part of our discussion compares the Vision Pro with other VR headsets in the market. We highlight the distinct features of the Vision Pro that set it apart, especially its distortion correction capabilities and suitability for productivity tasks, contrasting it with the Meta Quest's gaming prowess. We also explore the potential for third-party headbands, future customization, and design possibilities, emphasizing Apple's unique position in the VR landscape and its differing approach from rivals.\nWe ponder the coexistence of Apple and Meta within the VR space, acknowledging the competition but also recognizing the distinctive strengths and target audiences each company caters to. This leads to a broader discussion about the challenges current VR headsets face, such as eye strain, and the optimistic outlook for technological improvements over time that could mitigate these issues.\nA considerable part of our discussion tackles the technicalities and challenges surrounding Personas and face scanning with the Vision Pro, including the influence of factors like face shape, hair, and lighting conditions on the accuracy of these features. Quinn also shares insights on the integration of iPad apps with the Vision Pro, highlighting how this has transformed his workflow in certain instances and the potential it unlocks for productivity.\nDespite the mix of frustrations and amazement the Vision Pro has brought, we come to a consensus acknowledging the exciting possibilities the device offers for the future of VR and productivity, considering whether or not we would recommend Apple's headset to others.\nSee more of Quinn's work over on his YouTube channel, Snazzy Labs, and follow him on X @SnazzyLabs.

      "text": "On this week's episode of The MacRumors Show, we talk through Apple's plan to focus on the smart home with a host of new devices and improvements to Siri. An upgrade to ChatGPT-5 integration is planned for Siri with iOS 26, aiming to improve reasoning capabilities. The next-generation version of \u00e2\u20ac\u0152Siri\u00e2\u20ac\u0152 is now being tested with third-party apps including Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp. A more advanced large language model-based \u00e2\u20ac\u0152Siri\u00e2\u20ac\u0152, which will be more powerful than the \"personalized\" \u00e2\u20ac\u0152Siri\u00e2\u20ac\u0152, could launch as early as next spring. A visually redesigned \u00e2\u20ac\u0152Siri\u00e2\u20ac\u0152 interface for iPhones and iPads is also under consideration for release in 2026. The company is said to be recruiting engineers for its \"Answers, Knowledge, and Information\" team tasked with enhancing \u00e2\u20ac\u0152Siri\u00e2\u20ac\u0152, Spotlight, Safari, and other services. This team is in the early stages of creating a \"new ChatGPT-like search experience\" and is even exploring the possibility of a standalone \"answer engine\" app. The next-generation HomePod mini is expected to launch this year and will shift further toward the smart home. It will incorporate Apple's \"S11\" chip, a new Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 6E support, and potentially a second-generation ultra-wideband chip for enhanced spatial awareness. The refresh may also bring improved sound quality alongside new color options. Likewise, a new Apple TV is expected to launch this year with the A17 Pro chip and the new Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip. Meanwhile, Apple's first smart home hub is now expected in 2026 and will feature a 7-inch display paired with an integrated speaker, taking visual cues from Google's Nest Hub with a square display, thin black or white bezels, rounded corners, and a half-dome-shaped base. Designed for shared household use, its interface will emphasize clock faces and widgets for core Apple apps, including Calendar, Camera, Music, Reminders, and Notes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0152Siri\u00e2\u20ac\u0152 could feature a new visual interface, personified and inspired by the Mac Finder icon. The device will include a front-facing camera to deliver personalized content and features for each user, but it will not run third-party apps or have an app store. It is rumored to heavily rely on the next-generation version of \u00e2\u20ac\u0152Siri\u00e2\u20ac\u0152. Apple is also believed to be working on a Ring-style home security camera with facial recognition and motion detection to trigger home automations. Battery life is apparently being designed to last several months to a year. A facial recognition doorbell is also in development. The camera could debut alongside the 2026 smart home hub. Lastly, a so-called Apple \"robot companion\" is in the prototyping stage, targeted for a 2027 launch. It will feature a 7-inch iPad-like display mounted on a movable arm that can rotate and extend about six inches in any direction\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnicknamed internally as the \"Pixar lamp.\" Apple envisions it as an AI-driven household companion, powered by an advanced \u00e2\u20ac\u0152Siri\u00e2\u20ac\u0152 capable of remembering information, engaging in more natural conversations, and presenting a \"visual personality.\" The device could proactively interrupt with suggestions and be similar to OpenAI's voice mode. It will include Center Stage as well as joystick-controlled camera movement to show different parts of a room during calls. Take control of your finances with Copilot Money.

Developer beta available now ahead of public beta in July."

Now, it looks like the upgrade will be more minor than expected, focusing on new casing and display sizes, but with a design that continues to be effectively the same. The current 41mm and 45mm casing options are likely to be replaced with 45mm and 49mm models, meaning that the larger model would be the same size as the Apple Watch Ultra. The two models are expected to offer 1.89-inch and 2.04-inch display sizes, respectively.\nThe Apple Watch Series X could also feature hypertension and sleep apnea detection, a more efficient display, and a thinner logic board. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to be largely the same as the previous model, but potentially adding a black color option and the health features also coming to the Series X. A third-generation Apple Watch SE could also be on the way with the larger casing and display sizes of the Apple Watch Series 7, increasing from 40mm and 44mm to 41mm and 45mm.\nWe also discuss mouse support in visionOS 2 and our reflections on the AirPods Max after three and a half years with Apple's premium over-ear headphones.

The new synthetic fabric will reportedly feature a more technical and less luxurious design.\nCompared to FineWoven, the fabric is said to have a more rich, visible texture, as well as enhanced resistance to scratches and daily wear-and-tear. The material features a \"rubbery, grippy texture,\" but feels less premium than its predecessor in favor of practicality, but questions still remain about its long-term durability.\nThe new fabric cases will purportedly be available in green, orange, blue, and purple. They will also adhere to Apple's environmental goals.\nMoreover, there is also apparently the possibility of offering \"Liquid Glass\"-style cases, but Majin Bu provided no further information about what this could entail.

      "text": "In 2007, Apple launched the original iPhone, kickstarting the modern smartphone era which is now dominated by iPhone and Android devices. We've had 18 generations of iPhones so far, with the latest models, the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, introduced in September 2024, and the iPhone 16e released in February 2025. Apple follows an annual update cycle, introducing new flagship models while discounting prior-year models and selling them at more affordable price points.\niPhone vs Android\nOver the years, Android and iPhone smartphones have evolved to the point where feature-wise, they're similar in function and capability. Android smartphones are made by multiple manufacturers, but the core operating system is provided by Google, which leads to a wider variety of phones and price points to choose from, but weaker integration between software and hardware.\nApple's control of both the iPhone and the operating system (iOS) provides a more consistent experience along with ongoing support. With iOS 18, Apple supports all iPhones that were introduced in the last four years, so the majority of active iPhone owners can and do upgrade to the newest version of iOS that Apple rolls out each year.\nAndroid updates are often more inconsistent and often don't make it to all Android-based smartphones because each manufacturer has to implement support on an individual basis. So while Google also does yearly Android updates, the reality is that a lot of older Android smartphones don't get the new software.\nWith Apple's control and curation of the iPhone experience, the iPhone is largely considered to be the more secure platform, and Apple has made it a point to focus heavily on privacy. Apple's iOS is less customizable than Android, though, so for individuals who prefer flexibility and customization options, the Android operating system may be worth looking at.\nHow Do iPhone Updates Work?\nHere are the basics you should know about how Apple updates the iPhone and the iOS operating system.\nEach fall, typically in September, Apple releases a new series of flagship smartphones. These often come at high prices and feature the latest technologies, with Apple offering high-end models and still high-end but more affordable models. Prior-year iPhones often stick around with lower price points as cheaper alternatives to the latest and greatest technology, and occasionally, Apple launches a lower-cost iPhone outside of the normal fall timeline.\nAt the current time, Apple's iPhone lineup includes the iPhone 15 (2023), iPhone 15 Plus (2023), iPhone 16 (2024), iPhone 16 Plus (2024), iPhone 16 Pro (2024), iPhone 16 Pro Max (2024), and iPhone 16e (2025).\nApple also debuts an updated version of iOS at the same time that new iPhones launch, but new versions of iOS are pre-introduced every year at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference to give developers time to incorporate new features and technologies into their apps ahead of when the software becomes available to the public. The current iPhones run iOS 18.\nIn this guide, we go over all of the iPhones that are in the current Apple lineup, offer up some buying suggestions, and provide tips and resources for both new and existing iPhone owners.\niPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max ($999+)\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are Apple's current high-end flagship devices with all of the top-of-the-line features and the most bells and whistles. The Pro models are for those who want to get the most out of their iPhones with the latest feature set.\nPricing on the iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999, while pricing on the iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199. The two iPhones are nearly identical when it comes to feature set, and it's only display size and battery capacity that set the two devices apart.\nApple introduced larger screen sizes and slimmed down bezels for the Pro lineup in 2024, so the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a larger 6.9-inch display (up from 6.7 inches), and the iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3 inch display (up from 6.1 inches). Both models feature the same design with a glass front and back, a lightweight but durable titanium frame, and squircle edges. Colors this year include natural titanium, white titanium, black titanium, and desert titanium, which is a shade of gold.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max feature edge-to-edge OLED displays with the slimmest bezels we've seen in an iPhone to date. There's a second-generation \"Ceramic Shield\" that offers superior scratch resistance, and a pill-shaped Dynamic Island continues to house the front-facing camera and hardware used for Face ID authentication.\nThe customizable Action button is still available, and it now does more thanks to Control Center integration. This year, Apple also added a Camera Control button that can be used to activate the camera with a press. Camera Control makes it quicker to capture photos and videos, and it is also pressure and touch sensitive so you can change controls and adjust settings without touching the screen.\nThe Dynamic Island has been incorporated into the iPhone's interface and it is able to show various notifications and app information for phone calls, timers, Face ID, Bluetooth connections, and more.\nApple added a new A18 Pro chip to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, with a 6-core CPU, a 6-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is up to 20 percent faster than the A17 Pro from the iPhone 15 Pro models, and it is the fastest iPhone for Apple Intelligence.\nThere continues to be a three-lens camera setup with a 48-megapixel Main camera that offers improved low-light performance, a 12-megapixel 5x Telephoto lens, and a new 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera. The 5x Telephoto is available for both Pro models, which is new this year, and the 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera takes improved wide-angle and macro shots when lighting is poor.\nCrash Detection is able to determine if you've been in a serious car accident, alerting emergency services, and there's also an Emergency SOS via satellite feature for getting help if you're out of range of Wi-Fi and cellular. With iOS 18, the satellite connectivity can be used to send messages too.\nBoth iPhone 16 Pro models offer improvements to battery life, and they have a USB-C port and support for up to 25W MagSafe charging.\nOther features include IP68 water resistance, 8GB RAM, ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate for the display, faster 5G, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, faster USB-C charging, and Wi-Fi 7.\nKey Features:\n- Highest end, highest price\n- Triple-lens camera: Main (Wide), Ultra Wide, and Telephoto (5x for the Max)\n- 48-megapixel Main lens with ProRAW support\n- 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens with macro capability\n- Camera Control button\n- A18 Pro chip\n- Action button\n- Always-On Display\n- Titanium frame\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are the iPhones to choose if you want the absolute best camera capabilities that you can get in an iPhone, with the Pro Max being the top-of-the-line model due to its increased display size, and longer battery life. In terms of performance, there isn't much of a difference between the iPhone 16 Pro models and the standard iPhone 16 models, with screen size, display quality, and chassis material differentiating the two iPhone lines.\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus ($799+)\nSold alongside the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are Apple's more affordable flagship devices. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus feature many of the same capabilities as the Pro models, but they are missing some of the higher-end features to keep the price lower. The 6.1-inch iPhone 16 is priced starting at $799, while the 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus is priced starting at $899.\nDespite the difference in screen size, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are essentially identical, featuring a flat-edged design with a glass body and an aluminum frame. They do not offer ProMotion display technology and thus do not support an always-on display, but they do have the same Dynamic Island, front-facing camera, and Face ID authentication functionality.\nApple brought the Action button to the iPhone 16 lineup this year, so that is no longer a Pro-only feature. The Action button replaces the Ring/Silent switch, and it is customizable, so you can set it to bring up whatever is most convenient for you. It can mute/unmute your iPhone, activate the flashlight, open a favorite app, activate a Control Center control, turn on a Focus mode, and more.\nLike the iPhone 16 Pro models, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus have a new Camera Control button below the power button. Pressing the button activates the camera, and a double press snaps a photo, so it makes it much quicker to get the shot that you want. The button is capacitive and pressure sensitive, so it can be used for changing various camera settings and swapping between tools. It works much like a DSLR shutter for autofocus with a half press, and you can adjust exposure, style, zoom, aperture, and more without ever touching the iPhone's display.\nWhile the iPhone 16 Pro models have an A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 models have an almost-as-capable A18 chip that also works with Apple Intelligence. The A18 has the same 6-core CPU and 16-core Neural Engine, but it has a 5-core GPU instead of a 6-core GPU. The chip is built using the same 3-nanometer technology, and it enables support for ray tracing and console-quality games, a feature that was previously limited to the Pro models. Battery life has improved compared to the prior iPhone 15 models thanks to the new chip technology.\nThere is a dual camera system that features 12-megapixel Ultra Wide and 48-megapixel Fusion (Wide) lenses with no Telephoto lens. The primary camera can be cropped in to a 2x zoom, so 0.5, 1x, and 2x options are supported. Some of the same photography and videography capabilities that are in the Pro models are also in the standard iPhone 16 models, including the new Photographic Styles for customizing your images and Audio Mix for adjusting the sound in your videos, plus support for shooting spatial videos and images.\nCapturing video in 4K at 120 frames per second is a Pro-only feature, as is support for shooting in ProRAW and ProRes, so if those are capabilities you need, you'll want to look at the Pro models.\nThe iPhone 16 models have support for mmWave (U.S. only) and Sub-6GHz 5G, and they also have a USB-C port and offer MagSafe charging at up to 25W, a new, faster speed this year. Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via satellite, and Messages via satellite are available as well. Compared to the Pro models, the standard models lack the titanium chassis, the Telephoto camera lens, and the A18 Pro chip.\nKey Features:\n- Dual-lens camera: Fusion (Wide), Ultra Wide\n- Crash Detection\n- USB-C port\n- Action button\n- Camera Control\n- A18 chip\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus offer many of the same features as the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max at a more affordable price, and these are the iPhones that we recommend for most people. The differences are limited primarily to the camera and the display, and may not be of interest for those who are not heavily invested in iPhone photography, making the $200+ savings worth it for most. Older iPhones are another option to save money, but be aware that only the four iPhone 16 models and the prior-generation iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max support Apple Intelligence.\niPhone 16e ($599+)\nPriced starting at $599, the iPhone 16e is similar in design to the iPhone 16, but it is actually modeled after the iPhone 14. It has an all-display design with Face ID, but it has an older-style notch rather than a Dynamic Island.\nThe iPhone 16e has a 6.1-inch OLED display like the iPhone 16, and it has the same 8GB RAM and A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence, though there is one less GPU core. It is the first iPhone with Apple's new C1 modem, which is more efficient than Qualcomm's comparable X71 modem in the iPhone 16. While there is no mmWave 5G support, there seems to be no compromise to the more widespread sub-6GHz Wi-Fi speeds.\nThere is a single-lens rear camera in the iPhone 16e, and it is the same as the 48-megapixel Wide camera in the iPhone 16. It can take 1x and 2x photos, but there is no 0.5x option and no 5x zoom as there is in the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nThe iPhone 16e has the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone, and the battery lasts for up to 26 hours when watching video. It charges via USB-C, but it does not support MagSafe and wireless charging is limited to 7.5W. Not being able to use MagSafe is one of the main downsides to the iPhone 16e.\nIt is also worth noting that there is no Ultra Wideband chip for Precision Finding in the Find My app, and it is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so it will not connect to the 6GHz networks available with Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers.\nOther features include Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via Satellite, and Messages via Satellite, but these are also features available with other iPhone 16 models.\nKey Features:\n- Face ID\n- A18 chip\n- Lower price\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16e is now Apple's lowest-price iPhone, and it is worthwhile if you can live without a dual-lens camera system, faster Wi-Fi connectivity, and MagSafe. It has many of the same features as the iPhone 16 at a $200 lower price point.\niPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus ($699+)\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are Apple's prior-generation flagship devices that are now being sold at a discount. They have older technology and are lacking some of the new features that Apple introduced with the iPhone 16 models, including the Camera Control button, the faster A-series chip, the Action button, and, most importantly, support for Apple Intelligence. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus cannot run the new Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18, so only consider Apple's prior-generation iPhones if that is not important to you.\nThe iPhone 15 models don't look notably different from the iPhone 16 models, except for the color options. Apple did not make major design changes, but the iPhone 15 models do not have a Camera Control button and they have a Ring/Silent switch instead of an Action button. There's also a diagonal rear camera setup that does not offer some of the newer camera capabilities like Photographic Styles for customizing the look of your images or Audio Mix for tweaking the sound in your videos.\nWhile the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus don't support some of the newer software-based camera features, the hardware is largely the same. There's a Main (Wide) lens that supports 1x and 2x zoom, and an Ultra Wide lens. There is no dedicated Telephoto lens.\nThe iPhone 15 measures in at 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 15 Plus is 6.7 inches. The two devices are essentially identical, with a Dynamic Island for Face ID, aluminum frames, and OLED screen technology. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have an older A16 chip that is two generations behind the newer chips in the current flagship models.\nThe iPhone 15 models have support for mmWave (U.S. only) and Sub-6GHz 5G and use the X70 Qualcomm chip, one generation behind the Qualcomm chip in the new iPhones. Battery life is a little shorter, but the iPhone 15 models do support MagSafe and USB-C. There is no support for the faster 25W MagSafe charging, though, with the iPhone 15 models limited to 15W MagSafe charging.\nBetween the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, the features are identical with the exception of screen size and battery, as the iPhone 15 Plus can accommodate a larger battery size.\nKey Features:\n- Diagonal dual-lens camera: Main (Wide), Ultra Wide\n- Crash Detection\n- USB-C port\n- Dynamic Island\n- 5G support\n- A16 chip\nBottom Line: The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are solid devices that will perform well at an affordable price, but keep in mind that the iPhone 16 is such a notable upgrade that it may be worth paying $100 more for the iPhone 16 this year. The iPhone 15 models do not have an Action button or a Camera Control button, and they cannot run the Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18, so you'd be missing out on the more capable Siri, customizable emoji, Writing Tools, and other Apple Intelligence functions. A prior-generation iPhone is usually a good way to save money, but this year, we don't recommend it.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThere's no one single iPhone that's best for everyone, and picking the right smartphone needs to take into account factors like budget, desired battery life, preferred feature set, and more.\nIf you want the absolute best photographic capabilities for example, you're going to want the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max, and if you want something that has a solid feature set at a great price, the iPhone 16e is what you'll want to look at.\nBelow, we've outlined some of the best iPhone choices based on different scenarios or features that you might be looking for.\nWhich iPhone Has the Best Battery Life?\nWith the efficient A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has the longest battery life for any iPhone to date at up to 33 hours when watching videos. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Plus are second and will last up to 27 hours when watching videos. The iPhone 16e lasts for up to 26 hours when watching videos, and it is the smallest of the bunch at 6.1 inches.\nWhich iPhone Has the Best Camera?\nWith their updated triple-lens camera systems, 48-megapixel Fusion lens, 5x Telephoto lens, 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and LiDAR Scanners, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max have the best iPhone cameras that you can get. Both of the new iPhones include a three-lens camera system with the same feature set. This year, the Ultra Wide lens has been upgraded to 48 megapixels, allowing for more detailed wide-angle and macro shots.\nThe Fusion lens supports 24-megapixel and 48-megapixel high-resolution photos through the Photonic Engine, and the Ultra Wide lens supports 12-megapixel images that have the detail from the combined pixels of the 48-megapixel resolution. Using computational photography, the Fusion camera can be set to 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths to better mirror what's possible with DSLRs.\nAll four iPhone 16 models have a new Camera Control button that makes it easier to capture a photo or a video with just a couple of button presses, and the Camera Control button is also capacitive and pressure sensitive so it can be used for changing photography modes and adjusting settings, which makes your iPhone feel more like a camera.\nWhich iPhone Has Touch ID?\nUnfortunately, none of Apple's iPhones have Touch ID. It has been phased out, and Face ID is the only option.\nWhich iPhone is Best For One-Handed Use?\nThe iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16e both measure in at 6.1 inches, and they are the smallest iPhones that Apple makes. They won't work for one-handed use for everyone, but they are a better option than the 16 Plus and 16 Pro Max.\nWhich iPhone is the Best Value?\nWith Apple Intelligence support, a 48-megapixel camera, OLED display, and 5G connectivity for $599, the iPhone 16e is the best deal that Apple offers. If you need faster mmWave 5G speeds, Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, MagSafe, and an Ultra Wide camera, the $799 iPhone 16 is the upgrade option.\nIf you don't need the latest bells and whistles like Apple Intelligence and don't mind losing out on a bit of performance and battery life, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, which are $100 cheaper than than their iPhone 16 counterparts, could be worth considering.\nFor many people, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16e are the iPhones to get this year with their lower price point and modern feature set.\nWhich iPhone Has the Most Features?\nIf you want the iPhone with the most bells and whistles, that's the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. These iPhones offer OLED displays, triple-lens cameras, glass bodies with titanium steel frames, larger maximum storage capacities, and longer battery life.\nCompared to the iPhone 16 models, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have better camera capabilities. The absolute best would be the iPhone 16 Pro Max because of its larger display and bigger battery.\nIn More Detail\nStill not sure?

      "text": "Apple is working on an updated version of the AirPods Pro, and the new earbuds are expected to see a launch in 2025, likely at the September 9 iPhone event. There are several exciting new features that are rumored for the AirPods Pro 3, and we've rounded up what we know so far.\nRefreshed Design\nThe AirPods Pro 3 are going to get an updated design. Exactly what will be changing remains a mystery, but Apple is expected to update both the earbuds and the case to accommodate new features that are planned.\nThe AirPods 4 were updated with a smaller case last year, and Apple is rumored to be planning a similar change for the AirPods Pro 3. The case could be slimmed down, and the earbuds could also get a design tweak. Apple could make the stem smaller, or remove it entirely, plus the earbuds could be made smaller to make them more comfortable. The case will get a capacitive button that is not visible, much like the AirPods 4.\nBetter Audio Quality\nApple tends to boost audio quality with each new iteration of the AirPods, and rumors suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will see audio improvements with better sound quality. We're also expecting further improvements to Active Noise Cancellation, and with Apple's focus on the Vision Pro headset, audio quality will be more important than ever.\nThe current USB-C version of the AirPods Pro 2 are designed to pair with the Vision Pro and offer lossless audio, so further feature additions for the Vision Pro and subsequent headsets are a good bet.\nImproved ANC\nThe next-generation AirPods Pro could include \"much better\" Active Noise Cancellation capabilities compared to the AirPods Pro 2, according to rumors. No information about how Apple will improve ANC is available at this time.\nUpdated Chip\nThe AirPods Pro 2 use the H2 chip, and the next-generation version of the AirPods Pro are expected to get an even faster chip, which Apple could call the H3 if it sticks with that naming scheme.\nThe current H2 chip powers everything from Active Noise Cancellation to Hey Siri, fast switching, and Adaptive EQ, so the H-series chips are key to AirPods functionality. The H3 chip's processing power could be important for health-related features rumored for the AirPods Pro, and it could bring improved range and connectivity.\nHearing Health Improvements\nThe AirPods Pro 2 have a Hearing Assistance feature that includes a hearing test and the option to use the AirPods Pro 2 as hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss, and this functionality will also come to the AirPods Pro 3. In the future, Apple might improve upon these features.\nHealth Features\nThe third-generation version of the AirPods Pro are expected to include health-related features like heart rate monitoring and temperature sensing. Heart rate monitoring will allow more people to access heart data for health and fitness purposes without the need for an Apple Watch, while temperature sensing can be more accurate in the ear.\nAirPods 4 Features\nApple removed the physical pairing button on the AirPods 4, replacing it with a hidden capacitive button at the front. The light was also moved under the plastic of the casing, so it's more subtle when it's turned on and invisible when the LED is off.\nApple is expected to make the same change to the AirPods Pro 3.\nRelease Date\nApple is planning to hold an event on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The AirPods Pro 3 could be introduced at the fall event."

      "text": "Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Models\nContents\nOn September 9, Apple will introduce the iPhone 17 Pro and the iPhone 17 Pro Max, two new high-end flagship devices that will be sold alongside the iPhone 17 and the all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 \"Air\" that's replacing the iPhone 17 Plus.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will get a refreshed design for the rear casing and the camera area. Rumors suggest Apple could go with a part glass, part aluminum build, which would increase durability. The glass would allow wireless charging to continue to be available, but a partial aluminum frame would be less prone to breakage.\nWe're also expecting an update to the rear camera, with some rumors suggesting Apple is working on a horizontal camera bump that would be a major deviation from the current square-shaped camera arrangement. With this setup, there would be a centered, horizontal camera bump at the back of the iPhone, with the three lenses arranged in either a horizontal orientation or the standard triangle orientation, just with a larger bump.\n120Hz ProMotion refresh rates are rumored for all models, so better refresh rates may no longer be a Pro iPhone exclusive Apple is also rumored to be adding a more resilient anti-reflective display that's able to better hold up against drops and scratches.\nThere won't be size changes, because Apple increased the size of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max last year, and there are no rumors of an updated size. The iPhone 17 Pro will continue to measure in at 6.3 inches, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be 6.9 inches.\nApple is developing new A-series chips for the iPhone 17 Pro models, built on the latest 3-nanometer node. We could see some improvements to efficiency and performance, with Apple set to use A19 Pro chips for the higher-end 2025 iPhones.\nThis roundup focuses on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. For an overview of all iPhone 17 models, we have a separate iPhone 17 roundup, and we also have specifics on the super thin iPhone 17 Air in that roundup.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\nThere will be two models, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Apple increased the size of the Pro lineup last year, and we're expecting those same screen sizes with no further changes in 2025. The iPhone 17 Pro will measure in at 6.3 inches, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max will measure in at 6.9 inches. Overall size isn't going to change, but rumors suggest we could see some \"significant\" design updates, specifically to the rear of the device.\nApple could eliminate the titanium frame that it's used for the last several years, instead transitioning back to using aluminum. The iPhone 17 Pro models might have an aluminum frame and a back that's half glass and half aluminum instead of all glass. The half-and-half design would improve durability at the top where there's aluminum, while still allowing for wireless charging with the glass at the bottom.\nWhile some rumors have said the iPhone 17 Pro will have a two-tone design with a camera bump that's a different color than the rest of the device, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says that the camera area will be the same color as the rest of the iPhone, the same as the iPhone 16 models are now.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could be thicker in order to accommodate a larger battery, with the thickness coming in at 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm.\nRumors suggest that Apple might redesign the camera bump. Rather than a square bump, Apple could adopt a larger \"rectangular\" camera bump that's made from aluminum instead of glass and that spans across the back of the device. A horizontal camera bump would be a major design change, and suggests that the lenses of the camera would be arranged horizontally.\nThere is said to be a \"glass section\" around the logo that's integrated into an \"overall metal chassis,\" which has previously been described as a half aluminum, half glass build. The glass section of the iPhone will accommodate wireless charging, while the rest could be made from aluminum to improve durability.\niPhone 17 Pro dummy models and CAD Renders have an outlined area on the back that ranges from the camera module to the bottom of the chassis, mirroring the rumored half aluminum, half glass design that we've heard about.\nA leaked iPhone 17 Pro aluminum chassis features an area for the camera bump, confirming that the next-generation iPhone will a sturdier build that won't break as readily as glass.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro cases provide a look at just how large the rear camera bump might be. There is an oversized rectangular cutout that spans the entire back of the case.\nA test version of the iPhone 17 Pro may have been spotted in the wild, with the device confirming the updated rear camera design.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could have a new antenna design that wraps around the rear camera bump, possibly providing improved 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity compared to prior-generation models. There may also be fewer antenna lines.\nColors\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro components suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro models could be available in a copper-like orange color, along with black, gray, silver, and a dark blue shade. If the parts are accurate, these could be the colors that Apple will offer.\nOne leaker has suggested that one of the iPhone 17 Pro colors could somehow reflect the Liquid Glass design language in the iOS 26 update. Instant Digital said that there is a \"special\" color that is \"connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design.\nThe leaker believes that the color that prior leaks refer to as white actually looks different depending on the light, perhaps with more of an iridescent look.\nMagSafe\nApple may relocate the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models, possibly because of the redesigned camera module. Rumors suggest that Apple will move the logo lower on the device, and it could be located inside a break in the MagSafe ring.\nTo accommodate the relocated logo, Apple may also tweak the MagSafe magnet layout compared to existing iPhone models. Leaked images of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro magnet array feature a design with an open bottom for the Apple logo.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nDisplay\nAll iPhone 17 models could get 120Hz ProMotion technology in 2025, which would mean ProMotion would no longer be a Pro-only feature.\nWhile multiple rumors have suggested ProMotion display capabilities will expand to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, a Chinese leaker believes that's partially inaccurate. The leaker says that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will get 120Hz displays, but that the displays will not support adaptive refresh rates down to 1Hz.\nA 120Hz panel would allow for smoother scrolling, animations, and UI transitions, but it would not allow for always-on display functionality.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models were going to be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating, but it sounds like that might not happen this year after all. Apple ran into issues scaling up its display coating process, and it was too slow when taking into account millions of devices, so the coating plan was scrapped.\nThere have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island across the iPhone 17 lineup, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size.\nA-Series Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will adopt Apple's next-generation A19 Pro chip. The A19 Pro will be built on an upgraded N3P 3-nanometer process that should bring modest efficiency and speed improvements compared to the A18 Pro.\nRAM\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have 12GB RAM, up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nThermal Improvements\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could use a vapor chamber cooling technology for improved thermal performance. Vapor chamber technology disperses heat across a larger surface area to prevent thermal throttling and to keep performance stable, and it could be a benefit for Apple's high-powered A19 chip.\nA copper thermal plate said to be for the vapor cooling system surfaced in June.\nCamera\nAll four 2025 iPhone models are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nApple is expected to upgrade the Telephoto lens to 48 megapixels, a major improvement over the current 12-megapixel Telephoto lens. The iPhone 17 Pro models will be the first iPhones with three 48-megapixel lenses, as the Wide and Ultra Wide lenses have already been upgraded to 48 megapixels.\nOne leaker has suggested the new 48-megapixel Telephoto lens will offer 3.5x optical zoom (85mm equivalent) instead of the 5x zoom (120mm equivalent) that is currently available. 3.5x optical zoom could be better suited for portraits, and the higher resolution allows for more cropping in, allowing Apple to also simulate 5x optical zoom. Apple already uses this method for the Fusion camera in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, as the Wide lens enables a 2x digital crop that is the only \"telephoto\" option for Apple's more affordable iPhones.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could support shooting 8K video, up from the current 4K recording maximum.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models might offer dual video recording, a feature that would allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously. Some apps already support this functionality, which is useful for content creators, but the built-in camera does not.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro's Wide camera could have a mechanical aperture that lets users adjust the size of the aperture to tweak the amount of light that reaches the lens. Current iPhones have fixed apertures, but a variable aperture will allow for more control over the depth of field.\nOne tipster claims that the iPhone 17 Pro will feature a Telephoto lens that supports up to 8x optical zoom, up from 5x optical zoom on the 16 Pro models. There may also be a second Camera Control button for accessing camera settings.\nIt's possible that some feature of the Telephoto lens will be exclusive to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. The Telephoto lens is supposed to get upgraded to 48 megapixels, and there are rumors that the lens might be able to switch from 5x zoom to 8x zoom.\nThe 5x to 8x zoom could possibly be limited to the iPhone 17 Pro Max because a moving lens like that requires more internal space.\nBattery and Charging\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max could have Apple's biggest iPhone battery to date, with a battery capacity of 5,000mAh. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 4,676mAh battery, so the 17 Pro Max could last longer than the 33 hour maximum that the 16 Pro Max features. The A19 Pro and new Qualcomm Snapdragon X80 modem could also increase battery life.\nWith the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, Apple introduced a new battery adhesive that can be loosened with a low-voltage electrical current, making the batteries easier to remove and replace. That same technology could be used in the iPhone 17 Pro models this year.\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models might have a reverse wireless charging feature that allows them to wirelessly charge the AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple supposedly tested reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but it's not yet clear if it will be in the final version of the device.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nAn image of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro battery suggests it will have a metal cover and a slight L-shape. Apple could also use the removable adhesive that it used for the standard iPhone 16 models, which would make repair simpler.\nConnectivity\nWhile the iPhone 17 Air will have Apple's C1 5G modem, the iPhone 17 Pro models will continue to use 5G modems from Qualcomm. Qualcomm modems support both 6GHz and mmWave 5G, while the C1 is limited to 6GHz 5G.\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\niPhone 17 Ultra?\nOne rumor has suggested the largest of Apple's iPhones in 2025 will be called the \"iPhone 17 Ultra\" instead of \"iPhone 17 Pro Max,\" but this is a rumor that we've heard twice before during the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, so there is a good chance that this information is not accurate.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and camera design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could be $50 more expensive than the prior-generation iPhone 16 Pro, but it might start with 256GB of storage rather than 128GB of storage, which would raise the price.\nLaunch Date\nApple is holding an \"Awe Dropping\" iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The iPhone 17 Pro models will debut at the event. Pre-orders are likely to follow on Friday, September 12, and a launch could happen on Friday, September 19.\nWhat's Next for the iPhone Lineup\nStarting in 2026, Apple will split its iPhone lineup between fall and spring launches. The iPhone 18 Air, iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and a foldable iPhone will launch in the second half of 2026, while the standard iPhone 18 and the iPhone 18e won't launch until spring 2027.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models that are coming in 2026 could have under-display Face ID, which would cut down on the size of the Dynamic Island. There might just be a single camera hole for the front-facing camera, with the camera cutout located in the top left corner. Later, in 2027, Apple could release an iPhone with an all-screen design, featuring an edge-to-edge display with no cutouts. Apple is essentially planning iPhone design updates every year through 2027.\nApple's first foldable iPhone is expected in fall 2026, and rumors suggest it will launch alongside the iPhone 18 Air and iPhone 18 Pro models. It is expected to have a \"nearly invisible\" crease when it's folded, thanks to a high-quality hinge.\nMore on the iPhone 18 lineup with Apple's first foldable iPhone can be found in our dedicated iPhone 18 roundup."

      "text": "Apple is planning to launch a new \"TechWoven\" line of cases for the iPhone 17 series, according to a leaker known as \"Majin Bu.\"\nTwo years ago, Apple stopped selling leather iPhone cases, as part of the company's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions. As an alternative, Apple introduced a new \"FineWoven\" line of fabric iPhone cases made from 68% post-consumer recycled content, but they were prone to scratches and stains and ultimately discontinued. Now, it looks like Apple has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a new-and-improved solution.\nTechWoven cases would be the spiritual successor to those much-maligned FineWoven cases, and it would be safe to assume that Apple took a lot of feedback into consideration. While still using fabric, the cases are said to offer \"enhanced durability.\"\nIf the TechWoven branding is legitimate, perhaps the name is based on \"technical textile.\"\nIn addition to a more durable design, the leaker reiterated that it will be possible to attach a lanyard to the cases, which appear to have tiny holes in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners for this purpose. While the boxes for the cases shown in the photos are said to be replicas, they are apparently representative of what Apple is actually planning.\nIf the replica box does prove to be representative, then it reveals that the cases will be compatible with a new \"Crossbody Strap\" option, which is presumably a large lanyard that can be worn around the neck. Wearing your iPhone has become a fashion trend in recent years, and a strap would also make it harder for a pickpocket to steal your iPhone.\nThe box also reveals that the cases are compatible with MagSafe and the Camera Control \u2014 no surprises there, but confirmation that those features continue to exist.\nColor options will apparently include Black, Brown, Blue, Green, and Purple, although one box reveals that the colors will have more specific names like Sienna as usual.\nWhile we cannot confirm if these cases are the real deal, the replica boxes would certainly pass as impressive fakes, even in the world of generative AI images. Nevertheless, some skepticism is always warranted with this type of rumor. Fortunately, Apple is expected to hold its iPhone 17 event in less than a month from now."

Subsequent reports revealed that Vision Pro chief Mike Rockwell has taken over the Siri team at Apple, which until recently was led by artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea. Software chief Craig Federighi is also believed to have taken on more responsibility to turn Apple Intelligence around.\nThe company has altered its marketing strategy away from the \"Hello, Apple Intelligence\" tagline and the features are finally expected to launch sometime within the next year. With this recent context, we get John's thoughts on how the situation has evolved since he wrote his article, including on the proposed class-action lawsuits against Apple over false advertising. We also look at how Apple may present its suite of AI features at WWDC later this year.\nMoreover, we reflect on the Vision Pro almost two years after its announcement, and John explains why he believes that the headset avoided the mismanagement that has mired apple Intelligence. We also talk through rumors about the second-generation Vision Pro headset that is expected to launch between fall 2025 and spring 2026 as a minor spec bump, simply upgrading from the M2 to the M5 chip. We also explore the highly anticipated lower-cost Vision headset, dubbed \"Vision Air,\" and how this could be positioned when it launches.\nWe look at the state of Apple's smart home proposition and the HomePod amid rumors that the company's first smart home hub product has been delayed to 2026. The device is believed to be finished and was originally scheduled to launch in March 2025, but due to its reliance on Apple Intelligence its release has reportedly been shelved until next year.\nFinally, we discuss the long-rumored foldable iPhone, pondering on what Apple is likely to do differently when it launches the device next year. The MacRumors Show also has its own YouTube channel, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.

      "text": "YouTuber and podcaster Andru Edwards joins us on this week's episode of The MacRumors Show to discuss the rumored \"iPhone Ultra\" model that could emerge next year.\nAccording to a recent report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has discussed offering a new top-of-the-line iPhone alongside the \"Pro\" and \"Pro Max\" models in 2024 at the earliest. Based on this timeframe, the device would be part of the iPhone 16 lineup or later.\nGurman initially said there was \"potential\" for an \"iPhone 15 Ultra\" to replace the \"iPhone 15 Pro Max\" this year, but he has since revised that prediction, suggesting Apple might release an even higher-end \"Ultra\" model above both Pro variants next year instead.\nGurman speculated that the future device could feature additional camera improvements, a faster chip, a larger display, and perhaps a portless design without Lightning or USB-C. He also said the device would be \"pricier\" than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which starts at $1,099.\nWe take a look at some of the biggest news from the past week, including reports that Apple may not update the Mac Studio with the M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips due to its similarity with the upcoming Apple silicon Mac Pro, iPhone reverse wireless charging for accessories like AirPods is still in the works, and the second-generation AirPods Max may not launch until the second half of 2024 at the earliest.\nAndru also tells us about his recent experience interviewing Apple's Laura Metz, the Director of Product Marketing, Anand Shimpi of Hardware Engineering, and Tuba Yalcin from the Pro Workflow team to discuss the design process behind Apple silicon, the M2 chip, the M2 Max MacBook Pro, the M2 Pro Mac mini, and more.

      "text": "Should You Buy the Apple Watch SE?\nRefreshed in September 2022, the Apple Watch SE is Apple's most affordable Apple Watch option. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of the Apple Watch Series 10 or the Apple Watch Ultra 2, as it lacks temperature sensing, ECG functionality, and blood oxygen monitoring, but it otherwise provides much of the key Apple Watch functionality.\nApple will refresh the Apple Watch SE in 2025, and a new model is expected in September 2025. For that reason, you may want to wait to make a purchase if you prefer to have the latest features. The next-generation Apple Watch SE is expected to feature a faster chip, and design changes are also a possibility.\nApple Watch SE Features\nContents\nAlongside the Apple Watch Series 8 in September 2022, Apple introduced a new version of the lower-cost Apple Watch SE for those who are looking for a more affordable, fitness-focused Apple Watch option that has all of the essential Apple Watch functionality at a lower price point.\nThe second-generation Apple Watch SE is almost identical to the Series 6, and it does not feature the updated design that was introduced with the Series 7. It also lacks some health sensors, and it does not include ECG, blood oxygen, or temperature sensing functionality as those health features require hardware components that Apple did not include in the Apple Watch SE in order to keep costs down.\nWhen it comes to design and features, the Apple Watch SE is something of a mix between the previous-generation SE and the more recent Series 8 models. The Apple Watch SE is available in 40mm and 44mm size options, and it has the same design as the Apple Watch Series 4, 5, and 6 models. It has the same S8 SiP dual-core processor that was used in the Apple Watch Series 8, which really has not been updated since the Series 6. Still, it offers performance improvements over the original Apple Watch SE, which had an S5 chip.\nAll Apple Watch SE models are aluminum and this model can't be purchased with a stainless steel or titanium casing. Casing colors include Midnight, Starlight, and Silver, but Apple did add a new matching back case made from a nylon composite material so the Apple Watch SE is even lighter than before. The Apple Watch SE is compatible with all Apple Watch bands other than those intended for the Apple Watch Ultra.\nThe Apple Watch SE has a Retina LTPO OLED display with 1000 nits brightness, but it does not have the same Always-On functionality that is available with the Apple Watch Series 10.\nThe Apple Watch SE includes a Haptic Digital Crown for navigating through the operating system, and Ion-X glass protects the display. It has the same speaker and microphone as the prior-generation SE, which are optimized for phone calls, Siri, and Walkie-Talkie.\nThe Apple Watch SE is water resistant to 50 meters and supports Apple Pay with skin authentication much like prior models, and though it lacks ECG and blood oxygen monitoring, it has the same optical heart rate sensor, gyroscope, and accelerometer so it can monitor steps taken, calories burned, stairs climbed, and heart rate, plus it can track sleep, look out for falls with fall detection, make emergency calls with SOS, check orientation with the compass, and watch out for overly loud sounds with sound detection features.\nApple sells both LTE + GPS and GPS only Apple Watch SE models, so there is an option to use the low-cost Apple Watch with cellular plans. Since it supports LTE, it can be used with Family Setup. Family Setup allows multiple Apple Watches to be paired with and managed by a single iPhone, so a family member without an iPhone can use an Apple Watch. Apple envisions this feature being used for children and elderly adults who need assistance.\nThe Apple Watch SE and Series 10 offer the same 18-hour battery life, but the Apple Watch Series 10 can charge much faster with just 15 minutes of charging providing up to 8 hours of normal use or 8 minutes of charging providing up to 8 hours of sleep tracking. The Apple Watch SE can take advantage of Low Power Mode to extend battery life even further at the cost of disabling certain features.\nA Crash Detection feature, which is also in the Series 10, uses an updated gyroscope and accelerometer along with an advanced sensor-fusion algorithm to detect severe car crashes and alert emergency services. When a crash occurs, the Apple Watch checks in with the user and if no response is received within a 10-second countdown, emergency responders are contacted.\nThe Apple Watch SE is priced starting at $249 for the 40mm model and $279 for the 44mm model, so it is more affordable than the prior-generation model. The Apple Watch SE is being sold alongside the more expensive Apple Watch Series 10 and the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nHow to Buy\nThe Apple Watch SE is available from the online Apple Store, Apple retail locations, and third-party retailers. The 40mm model is priced starting at $249, and the 44mm model is priced starting at $279. Apple also offers refurbished versions of the Apple Watch SE that can be purchased at a discount.\nReviews\nInitial reviews of the second-generation Apple Watch SE were positive, but noted the very incremental upgrades compared to the previous generation. The improvements include the S8 chip, car crash detection, and international roaming.\nGiven that the S8 chip features the same CPU as the S7 and S6 chips, the Series 8 does not have any notable performance improvements compared to the Series 7 or Series 6, but the second-generation Apple Watch SE is up to 20% faster than the original. Engadget's Cherlynn Low confirmed that the second-generation Apple Watch SE performs equally to the Series 8 given both models have the same chip:\nOtherwise, this year's Watch SE actually packs the same system-in-a-package (SiP) processor as the $400 Series 8, as well as a high-g accelerometer that makes crash detection possible. In my time with it, the SE has, unsurprisingly, been just as responsive as the Series 8, starting workouts and completing heart rate scans in the same amount of time.\nMobileSyrup's Patrick O'Rourke said that given the Apple Watch lacks major competition, Apple can get away with incremental year-over-year updates to the device:\nApple is in an interesting position with its Apple Watch. In the iOS space, there's really no viable competition, especially when it comes to the Apple Watch's app ecosystem, and even on Android, the closest is Samsung's Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. This leaves the tech giant with very little reason to really push the wearable forward with each new release.\nDesign and Display\nThe second-generation Apple Watch SE is identical in overall design to the original Apple Watch SE, featuring slim-bezeled displays in 40mm and 44mm size options to fit a variety of different wrists. The first-generation SE was modeled after the Apple Watch Series 6, so the Apple Watch SE does not feature the design changes introduced with the Series 7 or Series 10.\nThe Apple Watch SE measures in at 10.7mm thick and it features the same square-shaped design that Apple has used since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. With no design changes to the case, the Apple Watch SE works with all previous-generation Apple Watch band options other than those intended for the Apple Watch Ultra.\nApple's 40mm models measure in at 40mm high and 34mm wide, while the 44mm models are 44mm high and 38mm wide. The 40mm models weigh in at 26.4 grams and the 44mm models weigh in at 32.9 grams. The Apple Watch SE is the lightest Apple Watch that Apple sells.\nAll Apple Watch SE models are made from 100 percent recycled 7000 series aluminum, which is lightweight, inexpensive, and designed for an active lifestyle. The Apple Watch SE is available in Starlight, Silver, and Midnight colors.\nThe second-generation Apple Watch SE includes a redesigned back case made from a nylon composite material rather than ceramic, so it is lighter weight than the prior-generation model. The backing includes an optical heart rate sensor to enable the heart rate detection features.\nA Digital Crown on the side of the Apple Watch is available for navigation purposes, and there's a side button that's used to bring up frequently used apps, access emergency services, confirm Apple Pay purchases, and more.\nThe Digital Crown is equipped with haptic feedback that offers a precise, mechanical feel when scrolling through lists and controlling various aspects of the Apple Watch. The Digital Crown looks different depending on the Apple Watch model you purchase. LTE models have a red ring around the Digital Crown so you know that they have LTE functionality, while GPS-only models lack the red ring.\nThe Apple Watch SE offers many of the same display specifications as the Series 10 with the exception of peak brightness, Always-On functionality, and wide-angle viewing. It features 1000 nits brightness and Ion-X glass to protect it from scratches. The Apple Watch SE's display area is 20 percent smaller than the Apple Watch Series 10 because of differences in design.\nThe 40mm Apple Watch SE features a resolution of 324 x 394 pixels, while the larger 44mm Apple Watch Series has a resolution of 368 x 448. This translates to a 759 sq mm display area for the 40mm Apple Watch and a 977 sq mm display area for the 44mm Apple Watch.\nWater Resistance\nApple Watch SE models are rated for immersion in water as deep as 50 meters thanks to seals and adhesives. The speaker, which needs air to produce sound, is the only point of ingress and has been designed to expel water from itself using sound vibrations after exposure to moisture.\nBecause it is rated for 50m immersion, the Apple Watch SE can be used when swimming in the ocean or in a pool. It is only suited to shallow water activities, though, and can't be used for scuba diving, waterskiing, showering, or other activities that involve high-velocity water or deep submersion.\nApple's Apple Watch warranty does not cover water damage, so it is best to use caution when exposing the watch to water.\nS8 Chip\nThere's a dual-core S8 System-in-Package (SiP) in the updated Apple Watch SE, which is the same chip that Apple used in the Apple Watch Series 8. The S8 chip is up to 20 percent faster than the S5 chip that was in the prior-generation Apple Watch SE.\nHealth Features\nThe Apple Watch SE offers many of the same health features as the Apple Watch Series 10, but it lacks a blood oxygen sensor, temperature sensing, and the capability to take an ECG reading.\nThere is an optical heart rate sensor that calculates metrics like calorie burn, activity level, heart rate, and more.\nThe Apple Watch can detect a low heart rate, a high heart rate, and an abnormal heart rate, monitoring for health problems like atrial fibrillation and sending notifications when anomalies are detected.\nA built-in accelerometer and gyroscope enable other important health-related features such as fall detection and a new Crash Detection feature, and the LTE models support international SOS capabilities so you can call emergency services no matter where you are.\nSleep Tracking\nThe Apple Watch SE can be worn at night to monitor your sleep, with Apple providing data on how long you sleep each night. The feature also offers up useful tools for getting a better night's sleep, with details available in our Sleep Tracking guide.\nBattery Life\nThe Apple Watch SE offers all-day battery life of up to 18 hours. Apple bases \"all-day\" battery life on 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 60-minute workout with music playback via Bluetooth. For LTE models, Apple assumes four hours of LTE connection and 14 hours of connection to an iPhone.\nWith a Low Power Mode introduced in watchOS 9, the Apple Watch SE battery can last for up to 36 hours. Low Power Mode turns off heart rate notifications, background heart rate measurements, WiFi and cellular connections when the iPhone is not nearby, and other features to save power.\nIt takes approximately 1.5 hours to charge the Apple Watch SE from 0 percent to 80 percent, and 2.5 hours to charge it all the way to full from 0 percent. The Apple Watch SE does not support fast charging like the Apple Watch Series 10.\nConnectivity\nApple Watch SE models are equipped with the same Apple-designed W3 chip that is available in the Series 10. There are two Apple Watch SE configurations: GPS and GPS + Cellular. The GPS + Cellular SE models have an LTE connection while the GPS-only models do not.\nLTE\nLTE connectivity has been available since the Apple Watch Series 3, and with an LTE connection, the Apple Watch is untethered from the iPhone and does not require an iPhone or known WiFi network for an internet connection.\nThe Apple Watch is not entirely independent from the iPhone, though, because LTE connectivity through a carrier requires an Apple Watch and an iPhone 6s or later to share a cellular plan with the same carrier. The Apple Watch also does not have the battery capacity to be used full-time without an iPhone nearby.\nApple Watch LTE models are available in many countries around the world, with a full list on Apple's website.\nEmergency SOS\nLTE connectivity enables an international Emergency SOS feature that was first released with the Series 5. With Emergency SOS, the Apple Watch can make international calls to emergency services regardless of where the device was originally purchased or if there's an active cellular plan.\nThat means if you're traveling to another country and are injured or in a situation where you need help, you can activate the SOS feature on the Apple Watch by holding down the side button to automatically get in touch with that country's emergency services.\nInternational emergency calling works with the Apple Watch's fall detection feature, so if that's enabled, it automatically places an emergency call if the watch senses the user has taken a hard fall and remains motionless afterward.\nCrash Detection\nUpdated motion sensors and an advanced sensor-fusion algorithm allow the Apple Watch SE to detect a severe car crash and alert emergency services. After a crash is detected, the Apple Watch checks in with the user and then dial emergency services after a 10-second period with no response. It also alerts emergency contacts.\nThis functionality is also available in the Apple Watch Series 10 and the Apple Watch Ultra.\nWiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS\nApple Watch SE supports 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.3. It does not support 5GHz WiFi, which is supported on the Series 10.\nGPS has been included in the Apple Watch since the Series 2, and all Apple Watch SE models, LTE and non-LTE, feature an L1 GPS chip that allows the Apple Watch to determine its position without needing to be near an iPhone.\nWith GPS, the Apple Watch is able to keep tabs on speed, distance, and route when you're walking, running, hiking, or biking, providing more insight into your fitness activities. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and QZSS systems are supported for positioning technology across multiple countries.\nOther Features\nSensors\nThe Apple Watch SE includes a second-generation optical heart rate sensor (the Apple Watch Series 10 models use a third-generation sensor), an updated high-g accelerometer, a gyroscope, an ambient light sensor, and an always-on altimeter to track flights of stairs climbed, elevation gains when climbing, and more. Note that the altimeter can be inaccurate in some weather conditions.\nCompass\nApple Watch SE models are equipped with a built-in compass feature and a Compass app that allows users to see their heading, incline, latitude, longitude, and current elevation.\nApple redesigned the Compass app in watchOS 9, and it supports dropping waypoints and a backtrack feature that can retrace your route should you become lost.\nCompass functionality is baked into the Maps app to let users see which way they're facing when getting directions, and there are three new Compass complications for Apple Watch faces.\nStorage Space\nAll Apple Watch SE models feature 32GB of storage space, which is half the storage space available on the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nWhat's Next for the Apple Watch SE\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the next Apple Watch SE will have a \"new look,\" and in prior reports, he suggested that it could be made from a rigid plastic material instead of aluminum. Plastic could keep costs down, and it could appeal to parents who are looking for an Apple Watch for their children.\nWhile Apple has been working on a plastic Apple Watch SE, the device is said to be in \"jeopardy\" due to design and cost issues. Apple's design team reportedly does not like the look of the device, and the casing is not cheaper than the current aluminum chassis.\nThe Apple Watch SE 3 will come in two sizes, and it will have 1.6 inch and 1.8 inch display options. Apple does not provide display sizes for Apple Watch models and goes by casing size, so it is not quite clear what size the new SE will be. Apple has finalized the display for the Apple Watch SE 3, and it is now in production.\nThe Apple Watch SE 3 will have an updated S11 chip, but it will use the same T8310 architecture as the S10 chip in the Apple Watch Series 10. The S11 chip will feature the same performance as the S10.\nApple is holding an \"Awe Dropping\" iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The Apple Watch SE 3 will debut at the event. Pre-orders are likely to follow on Friday, September 12, and a launch could happen on Friday, September 19.\nApple Watch SE Changelog\n- August 27 - Updated with event info.\n- August 14 - Updated info about next-generation Apple Watch SE.\n- July 11 - Updated buyer's guide info.\n- January 13 - Added rumors about the next Apple Watch SE.\n- September 19 - Post event update.\n- September 6 - Updated Buyer's Guide information."

      "text": "The 2025 iPhone 17\nContents\n2025 may bring one of the biggest updates to the iPhone's design that we've seen since the 2017 iPhone X, with Apple rumored to be planning for an all-new iPhone 17 \"Air\" that has a thinner design, a new display size, a different look for the camera, and more.\nWe are expecting four total models in 2025: the iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro, the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and the new iPhone 17 \"Air.\" There will be no iPhone 17 Plus, with Apple doing away with the \"Plus\" lineup because it has not proven popular with customers. The slimmed down iPhone 17 Air won't be a direct replacement for the iPhone 17 Plus, instead making a debut as a new device option in the lineup. Rumors suggest that the upcoming iPhone 17 Air will have a display that's around 6.6 inches, and a chassis that's 6mm thick or less.\nIf we compare the iPhone lineup to the Mac and iPad lineups, the iPhone 17 Air will be comparable to the MacBook Air or the iPad Air, while the iPhone 17 Pro is the equivalent of the MacBook Pro or the iPad Pro.\nBecause the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will have 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch display sizes like the current 16 Pro models, the iPhone 17 Air will be right in the middle of those two devices in terms of size. Apple is also expected to increase the overall size of the standard iPhone 17 to 6.3 inches to match the size of the iPhone 17 Pro.\nSome early rumors suggested the slimmer iPhone 17 Air could be a high-end device that's more expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but it's actually going to be a mid-tier device that's less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, but more expensive than the iPhone 17. In that way, it will replace the \"Plus\" iPhone in the lineup as a middle ground in price between the 17 and the 17 Pro.\nAll four iPhones released in 2025 are expected to get ProMotion display technology with a 120Hz maximum refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video playback, which means that ProMotion will no longer be a feature limited to the Pro iPhone models. The change will be enabled by LTPO OLED displays that Apple is rumored to be using for all of the iPhone 17 models. Always-on display technology is also enabled by LTPO display technology, but it's not yet clear if always-on will come to all models or remain exclusive to the Pro iPhone models.\nFor the Pro models, Apple could swap out titanium for aluminum, and part of the glass frame could transition to aluminum for better durability. We've heard rumors indicating that the iPhone 17 Pro models will have a half-glass half-aluminum exterior, with the glass portion still allowing for MagSafe charging. This update could come alongside a camera design change, with Apple perhaps opting for a horizontal pill-shaped camera bump rather than the traditional square camera bump. We've also heard that the iPhone 17 Air could have a horizontal camera bump, so this is likely to be a design change that we'll see for multiple iPhones in the lineup.\nAs for camera updates, Apple is said to be working on an updated 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max could include an upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto camera, which would be an improvement over the current 12-megapixel sensor. The iPhone 17 is expected to have the same Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, while the iPhone 17 Air is expected to get a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera.\nAt least one iPhone 17 model next year will get an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip rather than a chip manufactured by Broadcom, and it's likely to be the iPhone 17 Air. Apple is also expected to use its own modem chip in the device, testing it instead of a Qualcomm chip. The standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro models are likely to continue to use Qualcomm chips.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\niPhone 17\nThis year, Apple is planning for an iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Air, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max, but there will be no iPhone 17 Plus in the lineup. Apple is nixing the \"Plus\" iPhone due to subpar sales and limited customer interest in the device.\nThe standard iPhone 17 will look a lot like the current iPhone 16, with most rumors focusing on the iPhone 17 Air and the iPhone 17 Pro models. So far, we haven't heard a lot that's specific to the iPhone 17, and it will be the iPhone that gets the fewest new features in terms of design.\nWe are expecting a larger display size. Rumors suggest the iPhone 17 display will be 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches. At 6.3 inches, it'll be the same size as the iPhone 16 Pro, which is also the size that Apple plans to use for the iPhone 17 Pro. Apple is eliminating the Plus model entirely, so there's just going to be the one lower-priced standard iPhone 17. Display sizes across the lineup will be 6.3 inches for the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro, 6.6 inches for the iPhone 17 Air, and 6.9 inches for the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\nThe iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to have a new rectangular camera bar with rounded corners, with the bar spanning the back of the iPhone. The standard iPhone 17 model is not expected to feature the same design change, and it will continue to look like the iPhone 16 with two vertical rear cameras positioned in a pill-shaped camera bump.\nApple is said to be testing new green and purple shades for the upcoming iPhone 17 models. The iPhone 17 models could come in black, white, steel gray, light blue, green, and purple.\nBased on CAD renders, mockups, and dummy models, there is no change to the design of the iPhone 17 camera, while the iPhone 17 Air has a single lens rear camera with an elongated bump. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max feature a wide bump that houses three lenses in the same arrangement as the current design, but with a horizontal bump that adds more space between the lenses and the LiDAR and flash.\nAll of the iPhone 17 models coming in 2025 could feature slimmed down bezels, with the smaller bezels of the 16 Pro and Pro Max expanding to the iPhone 17.\nThere have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island for the iPhone 17 models. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island on all four models, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size as the iPhone 16 Dynamic Island.\niPhone 17 'Air'\nMultiple rumors have suggested that Apple is working on an all-new version of the iPhone for 2025, with the device expected to have a \"significantly thinner\" design than current iPhone models. It won't be a direct replacement for the \"Plus\" iPhone that Apple has released for the last several years, but we aren't getting an iPhone 17 Plus this year in order to make room for the new iPhone 17 Air.\nWe've heard Apple's new super thin iPhone referred to as the \"iPhone 17 Slim\" or the \"iPhone 17 Air,\" but we don't know what Apple will actually call the new iPhone when it launches in 2025. iPhone 17 Air seems to make the most sense given that Apple already has a MacBook Air and an iPad Air and uses the name to distinguish those devices from higher-end Pro models.\nThe placeholder names reference the sleeker, thinner design of the device. Rumors have not exactly agreed on size, and we've heard everything from 5mm thick to a bit over 6mm thick. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes the iPhone 17 Air will be about two millimeters thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick, so an iPhone 17 that is 2mm thinner would come in at around 6.25mm. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, and his wording suggests that it would have a thicker rear camera bump area that exceeds the size of the 5.5mm chassis.\nAnalyst Jeff Pu has also suggested that the upcoming iPhone will be around 6mm thick, but The Information has said it will be between 5mm and 6mm thick. Dummy models are 5.5mm thick, so the iPhone 17 Air will be Apple's thinnest iPhone to date. The iPhone 6, which measured in at 6.9mm, is the thinnest iPhone Apple has released so far. iPhones actually got thicker with the iPhone X and beyond, as Apple needed more space for the battery, camera lenses, Face ID hardware, and more.\nAs for overall display size, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to fall somewhere between the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max in size. Separate rumors have targeted 6.55 inches, 6.6 inches, and 6.65 inches as the diagonal display size that Apple has settled on, which would make it smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but larger than the 17 Pro.\nRumors suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will weigh in at 145 grams. That would make it similar in weight to the iPhone SE 2 or the iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively.\nThe Information claims the rear camera of the device will be relocated from the upper left side of the iPhone to the center of the device. The camera setup was described as a \"large, centered camera bump\" on the back of the device. Such a design has been seen in an alleged component leak and in dummy models, plus we've heard similar rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have some subtle design changes so that all of the internal components can fit despite the thinness of the chassis. Dummy models suggest that the USB-C port on the bottom edge won't be centered front to back, and will instead be shifted closer to the rear of the device. Colors could include black, silver, gold, and a very light blue.\nThe speaker grilles have also been simplified, with just two holes on either side of the port rather than the typical five. The device will include MagSafe charging, a Camera Control button, and an Action Button.\nA closer look at the thin design of the iPhone 17 Air can be seen in a video that shows off an iPhone 17 Air dummy model. Dummy models are often an accurate representation of what we can expect, as they are created for case makers based on leaked information from Apple's suppliers.\nFor more information on the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, we have a dedicated iPhone 17 Air roundup.\niPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are going to have some significant design changes. Apple is allegedly planning to eliminate the titanium frame, instead going back to aluminum. Apple has not used aluminum for a higher-end iPhone since the stainless steel iPhone X was introduced in 2017.\nAlong with an aluminum frame, the iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to include a half-aluminum half-glass backing rather than an all-glass back. The top half of the back could be made from aluminum, while the bottom half will continue to be made from glass to support wireless charging functionality. A partial aluminum back would potentially make the iPhone 17 Pro models more durable to drops.\nApple is planning for a larger \"rectangular\" horizontal camera bump that is made from aluminum rather than glass. Current camera bumps are square, so a rectangular camera bump would be a notable design change. Though the rear camera design is changing, the lenses themselves are expected to still be arranged in a triangle shape.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro cases provide a look at just how large the rear camera bump might be. There is an oversized rectangular cutout that spans the entire back of the case.\nApple may relocate the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models, possibly because of the redesigned camera module. Rumors suggest that Apple will move the logo lower on the device, and it could be located inside a break in the MagSafe ring.\nTo accommodate the relocated logo, Apple may also tweak the MagSafe magnet layout compared to existing iPhone models. Leaked images of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro magnet array feature a design with an open bottom for the Apple logo.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro components suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro models could be available in a copper-like orange color, along with black, gray, silver, and dark blue. If the parts are accurate, these could be the colors that Apple will offer.\nAdditional rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro can be found in the iPhone 17 Pro roundup.\nOne leaker has suggested that one of the iPhone 17 Pro colors could somehow reflect the Liquid Glass design language in the iOS 26 update. Instant Digital said that there is a \"special\" color that is \"connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design.\nThe leaker believes that the color that prior leaks refer to as white actually looks different depending on the light, perhaps with more of an iridescent look.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nThermal Upgrades\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly use vapor chamber cooling technology for improved thermal performance. Vapor chamber technology disperses heat across a larger surface area to prevent thermal throttling and to keep performance stable, and it could be a benefit for Apple's high-powered A19 chip.\nWhile this could be a feature limited to the iPhone 17 Pro, there has been a rumor suggesting that Apple will use a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance across all iPhone 17 models.\nDisplay\nThere are a few enhancements coming to the iPhone 17's display, with Apple adding a new coating and planning to bring Pro features to standard models.\nThe iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air are expected to use the same OLED panel as the current iPhone 16 Pro models, which is sourced from Samsung. The panel has a 30 percent increase in brightness and improved longevity compared to the prior-generation iPhone 16 display.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models were going to be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating, but it sounds like that might not happen this year after all. Apple ran into issues scaling up its display coating process, and it was too slow when taking into account millions of devices, so the coating plan was scrapped.\nProMotion and Always-On\nThe 120Hz \"ProMotion\" refresh rate has been limited to the Pro versions of the iPhone for several years, but in 2025, it is expected to expand to the entire iPhone lineup. Multiple rumors suggest that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air models will include ProMotion support in addition to the iPhone 17 Pro models. ProMotion refresh rates would potentially allow for always-on display functionality, but it is not clear if Apple plans to expand always-on to the entire lineup.\nApple will use low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels for all iPhone 17 models, which is what enables ProMotion thanks to better power efficiency. ProMotion enables refresh rates ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz, and at the high end, the 120Hz refresh rate provides smoother scrolling and video content.\nWith all four iPhones slated to get ProMotion displays in 2025, ProMotion refresh rates will no longer be a feature that sets the Pro iPhone models apart.\nA-Series Chip\nThe iPhone 17 series won't get TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer chips, but we are expecting A19 chip technology that's likely built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. Apple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip, while the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air could have the standard A19 chip. There's also a chance that the iPhone 17 Air will have an A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core than the A19 Pro used for the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nThe A19 chips will be built on TSMC's 3NP process. Compared to earlier versions of 3nm chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.\nRAM\nThe iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Air are expected to include 12GB RAM, an improvement over the 8GB RAM in the current high-end iPhone 16 models. Rumors suggest the standard iPhone 17 will only have 8GB RAM.\nApple-Designed 5G Modem Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be one of the first iPhones to get an Apple-designed 5G modem, with Apple continuing to use Qualcomm modems for the other iPhone 17 models.\nApple's modem chip will be capable of theoretical 5G download speeds of up to 4Gb/s, which is slower than Qualcomm's modems in current phones. The chip will not support the fastest mmWave 5G, and will instead be limited to sub-6GHz 5G.\nSIM Tray\nApple will remove the physical SIM slot on iPhones in more countries next year, though it is not yet clear which countries. Apple did away with the SIM card tray in the United States with the iPhone 14 models, but a physical SIM has so far been present on iPhones sold outside of the United States.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to lack a SIM tray entirely because of how thin it is.\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi Chip\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\nBattery and Charging\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have batteries that are easier to remove, adopting the same technology Apple introduced in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus use a type of adhesive that can be loosened with a low-voltage electrical current, but the 16 Pro and Pro Max have standard adhesive.\nNext year, all iPhone 17 models might have the new, easier to remove adhesive, which makes battery replacements simpler.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models might have a reverse wireless charging feature that allows them to wirelessly charge the AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple supposedly tested reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but it's not yet clear if it will be in the final version of the device.\nCamera Updates\nAll iPhone models coming in 2025 are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to feature a 48-megapixel Wide camera, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and a 48-megapixel Tetraprism Telephoto camera, which will make it the first iPhone to feature three 48-megapixel cameras, and it is also expected to support 8K video recording for the first time.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera, while the standard iPhone 17 will have a dual-lens camera system with a Wide camera and an Ultra Wide camera.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models could feature a mechanical aperture that will let users adjust the size of the camera aperture, changing the amount of light reaching the lens. Current iPhone models have fixed apertures, but a variable aperture will let images be captured with shallow depth-of-field.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models might also support dual video recording, a feature that would allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously. Some apps already support this functionality, which is useful for content creators, but the built-in camera does not.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will continue to include a 5x Telephoto optical zoom lens, and it will still be a Pro-exclusive feature. The standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air will not have the 5x zoom option and will have no Telephoto lenses.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be priced at $899, which is the current price for the iPhone 16 Plus. At $899, the iPhone 17 Air would be more expensive than the iPhone 17, but less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 models may see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a $50 price increase compared to the iPhone 16 models, according to Jeffries analyst Edison Lee. The price increase would mean the base iPhone 17 would start at $850.\niPhone 17 Launch Date\nApple is holding an \"Awe Dropping\" iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The iPhone 17 models will debut at the event. Pre-orders are likely to follow on Friday, September 12, and a launch could happen on Friday, September 19.\nAfter the iPhone 17\nStarting in 2026, Apple will split its iPhone lineup between fall and spring launches. The iPhone 18 Air, iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and a foldable iPhone will launch in the second half of 2026, while the standard iPhone 18 and the iPhone 18e won't launch until spring 2027.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models that are coming in 2026 could have under-display Face ID, which would cut down on the size of the Dynamic Island. There might just be a single camera hole for the front-facing camera, with the camera cutout located in the top left corner. Later, in 2027, Apple could release an iPhone with an all-screen design, featuring an edge-to-edge display with no cutouts.\nApple's first foldable iPhone is expected in fall 2026, and it will launch alongside the iPhone 18 Air and iPhone 18 Pro models. It is expected to have a \"nearly invisible\" crease when it's folded, thanks to a high-quality hinge.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro expected in 2026 could have a main rear camera with a variable aperture. A variable aperture lens would allow the iPhone to perform more like a DSLR camera, providing users with more manual control over the amount of light entering the lens.\nA variable aperture lens would be able to better adjust to different lighting conditions, and it would also allow for more control over depth of field for sharper focus on subjects and smoother background blur.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models may include the C2 chip, an upgraded version of Apple's C1 modem. The C2 is expected to feature improved power consumption and transmission speed, and it will include mmWave 5G support.\nApple's iPhone 18 models will use Apple's A20 chip, which could be manufactured on the next-generation 2-nanometer process. The 2nm process will ensure that the A19 has notable speed and performance improvements over the 3nm A19 chip that's coming in the iPhone 17 lineup.\nA future version of the iPhone could have a 200-megapixel camera, which would match technology that Samsung has made available in its Galaxy line. The 200-megapixel camera would likely be for the rear Main lens, and a higher megapixel option would allow the iPhone to shoot photos with more detail. Images would be higher resolution, and would able to be cropped in further without loss of image quality."
