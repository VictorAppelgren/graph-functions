      "feedback": "The draft is solid but can be tightened to meet the Argos standards:\n\n1. **Add canonical‑handle citations** for every driver and catalyst so the causal chain is explicit:  \n   - Replace “September 5 U.S. payrolls” with “September 5 us_employment” (FAN5RYW6T).  \n   - Replace “Fed cuts” with “fed_policy” (FAN5RYW6T).  \n   - Replace “tariffs” with “us_tariffs” (FAN5RYW6T).  \n   - For tech earnings, add “spx” (FAN5RYW6T) to show the direct equity‑cluster link.  \n\n2. **State confidence** in the base case (≈60 % per source) to satisfy the “confidence” requirement.  \n\n3. **Condense to 4–5 sentences**: merge the two “possible rally” and “severe drop” sentences into a single risk‑scenario paragraph, leaving a concise base‑case line, a risk line, and a watch‑list line.  \n\n4. **Ensure each sentence ends with a citation** and that the handle names are in lowercase snake_case (e.g., us_employment, fed_policy, us_tariffs, spx).  \n\n5. **Add a brief catalyst window**: “September 5 us_employment (Sep 5), September 12 fed_policy (Sep 12), Q2 earnings (Jul 1‑Oct 31)”.  \n\nWith these edits the brief will satisfy the mapping, catalyst, and confidence criteria while remaining within the 4–6 sentence limit.",
