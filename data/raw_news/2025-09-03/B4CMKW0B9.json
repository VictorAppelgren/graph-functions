  "title": "Team Cherry had to go back to the drawing board for Hollow Knight: Silksong for one simple reason: \"Hornet being taller changes everything\"",
  "description": "\"Her fighting is so fast, and she's so competent, that it changes the way enemies need to be designed\"",
  "content": "Hollow Knight: Silksong is, at long last, almost here. In between my 112% replay of the first game, I've been pondering the December 2020 edition of Edge magazine that saw Team Cherry leads Ari Gibson and William Pellen briefly lift the curtain on Silksong before leaving us in the dark for years. After our latest Hollow Knight: Silksong hands-on preview, one snippet about the worldbuilding has been stuck in my mind: making your main character taller can have a butterfly effect across an entire game.\n\n\"Hornet being taller changes everything,\" Pellen told Edge at the time. This was one of the main reasons the team quickly realized their ideas for Silksong, once planned as a mere DLC adding another playable character to Hollow Knight, needed a game of their own.\n\nHornet comes up a few times in Hollow Knight, both as a boss fight and as an ally. She's considerably taller than the titular Knight, and much more agile, and that agility and physicality necessitated a game world that could keep up. Simply put, Hallownest ain't big enough for our warrior princess.\n\nAs Gibson put it: \"Hornet can travel so much faster, she can jump higher, she can mantle or clamber onto ledges, she's generally more acrobatic. So the caves around her have to expand to accommodate her height.\"\n\nPellen says \"the core of the world is mainly a reflection of Hornet: her fighting is so fast, and she's so competent, that it changes the way enemies need to be designed, and her nature as a character is echoed in the way the world is set up.\"\n\nIf you dropped Hornet into Hollow Knight as-is, it would probably either feel cumbersome, like a shoe on the wrong foot, or laughably easy as she pirouetted over and around any would-be hazards. The power of extending the Knight's attack range through equipable charms goes to show how impactful a simple size bump can be. Imagine being faster and taller in every way.\n\nWe've already seen this in the limited Silksong demo. As our own Josh West said of his hands-on time: \"Silksong is building smartly on exceptionally solid foundations, and it's doing so with a greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making.\"\n\nImportantly, Gibson pointed out, Hornet is also half-bug, grounding her character and design more in the physical realm of the buggy Hollow Knight universe and putting more distance between the ethereal elements that came to define the Knight.\n\n\"What that means is - and this perhaps happened automatically just through development - she's much more physical, and the world as a result is much more physical,\" he said. \"So there are less glowy orb things, and magic bursts of light, and many more blades and traps.\"\n\nAgain, this is building on artifacts of Hollow Knight. In boss fights, Hornet uses wires and needle traps against the player. Meanwhile, I'm in the corner dislodging and catapulting an obsidian hunk of my soul.\n\nIt's a fascinating design challenge that's led to a fresh approach for Silksong's world, as well as new and interesting ways to expand and customize Hornet's play style \u2013 ways that make sense for her, but wouldn't have suited the Knight. I can't wait to see how this feeds into progression and level design.\n\nOur Hollow Knight: Silksong countdown is putting all the news and details in one place as we await the big day.",

      "text": "Team Cherry hoped Silksong could be anyone's \"first Hollow Knight game,\" and one reason it took 7 years is they were \"comfortable\" not knowing what's gonna happen: \"The really interesting things are the things you sort of discover along the way\"\n\"The difficulty also sits alongside the game in that way,\" Team Cherry said\nHollow Knight developer Team Cherry has been slow-roasting Silksong for over seven years now, and in that time a few things remained constant for the studio: it hasn't given up hope that the sequel can be a good jumping-on point for players who missed the original, and for a while it wasn't really sure where it was going.\nWith everyone replaying or discovering Hollow Knight in the run-up to Silksong's September 4 launch (I just finished my 108% replay over the weekend), now seemed like a good time to revisit Team Cherry's comments to Edge magazine way back in 2020.\nIf you've played Hollow Knight, and especially if you've overcome grueling challenges like the Path of Pain or Pantheon gauntlets, you'll surely have an edge going into Silksong. That said, Team Cherry has always said the sequel was designed to be welcoming to players of all backgrounds.\nSilksong was built as \"a perfect jumping-on point for new players,\" Team Cherry's Ari Gibson told Edge for its December 2020 issue. \"We're trying to be really, really mindful that we want this to be a game that new people can come into, and experience as their first Hollow Knight game - that it sits alongside the original game, and the difficulty also sits alongside the game in that way.\"\nEven if you don't dig into the brutal optional content, Hollow Knight still lands on the harder side of Metroidvanias, so I'd imagine many fans are relieved the sequel won't be torquing the difficulty. Sometimes you just want to explore.\nAnd even with Silksong's launch so close, the phrase \"first Hollow Knight game,\" implying that this Metroidvania masterwork is, at last, a series rather than just a one-off, still doesn't feel real. So it's doubly fascinating to hear that, even way back then, Silksong was pretty loose-goosey.\n\"The way we approach these games is that they are just a web of ideas, and notions, that all pass through this filter of bugs, and caves, and ruined civilizations and whatnot,\" Gibson said at the time.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nCo-lead William Pellen added: \"With destinations that we're comfortable with not knowing what they are for a while - just building up or down to them.\"\nRather fittingly for a Metroidvania, Gibson said, \"the really interesting things are the things you sort of discover along the way.\"\nMuch more recently, Gibson and Pellen explained that Silksong took so long not because it was lurching in development hell, as some fans had feared, but because the team had a hard time putting an end to the development heaven they'd been enjoying.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Hollow Knight: Silksong countdown \u2013 live build-up to the bug-laden Metroidvania\u2019s long-awaited release\nAt long last, it's nearly time to play Silksong\nAfter seven long years, Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally set to release. As such, we're spinning up the ol' live blog to cover the event and give you a one-stop shop to get all the updates you need as launch comes and goes.\nIt's a story you've likely heard before, but Silksong started as Hollow Knight DLC that featured the fan-favorite character Hornet. So it goes with game development, though, ambition swelled and developer Team Cherry found itself with something that probably needed an entire new release to do it justice. And soon, that release will be upon us.\nAll the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date and time information is here if you need it.\nWhile the big question on everyone's minds is why development took so long, the answer is actually quite simple. Team Cherry is a lean size and simply enjoyed Silksong's development process. While the community would have liked more updates to stop themselves from bringing out the clown makeup for each new showcase of games news and reveals, Team Cherry didn't have much to offer aside from the fact that development was continuing. At least we got some laughs, I suppose.\nSilksong release time\n- 7am PT, September 4\n- 10am ET\n- 3pm BST\n- 10am CEST\nHollow Knight Silksong release time countdown\nThat's it for me tonight. While we get some rest to prepare for the big launch, the countdown continues. Check back tomorrow as we chronicle the release and reception of probably the most-anticipated Metroidvania ever.\nFor now, one last nugget of knowledge worth pondering: Silksong sent developer Team Cherry back to the drawing board after Hollow Knight, and it's all because new hero Hornet is a lot taller than our beloved Knight.\nIt does feel surreal to be less than 24 hours away from the release of Silksong.\nThe long-awaited release date reveal thrilled fans who'd been starved for any meaningful updates, but it scared the crap out of a bunch of other game developers. Ever since the news broke, multiple games have been delayed past early September specifically to avoid getting buried by Silksong \u2013 \"the GTA of indie games,\" as one studio put it.\nIn case you missed it, we played Hollow Knight: Silksong!\nThe demo, anyway. Our Gamescom Hollow Knight: Silksong hands-on preview saw boss man Josh West fall for the game \u2013 hard enough for him to want to play about 60 times more. As he said at the time:\n\"Silksong is building smartly on exceptionally solid foundations, and it's doing so with a greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making. I only played 30 minutes of Hollow Knight Silksong, and now I'm desperate for that to transform into 30 hours.\"\nI'm taking over from Iain as our resident Hollow Knight head, and I come bearing interesting news. A new world record for Hollow Knight speedrunning was completed just days ago, and as I plug away at my own 112% completion replay, it's absolutely blowing my mind.\nOne godly player finished every completion milestone in Hollow Knight, including every boss and upgrade, as well as every last Godmaster Pantheon boss, in under 2 hours and 50 minutes. Granted, it was literally one second under, but it still counts, and it's extremely impressive. I shudder to think what people are going to do to Silksong now that the Hollow Knight community is so much bigger today.\nRighto, I'm heading out for the day, but our resident Metroidvania sicko Austin will be along shortly to keep you in the loop with everything Silksong.\nHollow Knight: Silksong Ultrawide!For PC players, screen ratios up to 21:9 are fully supported. pic.twitter.com/NAM1wYy4NhSeptember 3, 2025\nSwiftly moving on to make myself feel better, Silksong publishing chap Matthew Griffin confirms on Twitter that the Hollow Knight follow-up supports ultrawide on screen ratios up to 21:9. See what that looks like in some rather excellent pictures above.\nHollow Knight: Silksong Steam backer codes have been sent out this morning. Game releases in about ~22 hours\n\u2014 @wario64.bsky.social (@wario64.bsky.social.bsky.social) 2025-09-03T16:06:47.818Z\nIn news that certainly isn't making me jealous, early backers are already getting their codes. Just the one day to go for the rest of us.\nWhile we're talking about cool cost-saving actions, Team Cherry also says Silksong will have a free Nintendo Switch 2 edition upgrade at launch, meaning you don't have to pay extra to get the 120hz mode.\nIt's no wonder No Man's Sky boss Sean Murray is turning the meme tables and begging Team Cherry to let him pay more for Silksong.\nNext up, while you can't pre-order the game, the cost won't be too great. Just the other day, Team Cherry revealed that the Silksong price will be $20, just $5 more than its predecessor.\nOn top of that, it took three years, but Xbox has finally delivered on its Silksong promise by ensuring Team Cherry's latest game hits Game Pass on day one. Just in case you don't fancy chucking 20 bucks at it.\nAnd away we go! First things first, it's worth noting that we're not getting a midnight release for Silksong. As you can see from the information above, the wait is just a little bit longer than you'd think. Given that it's taken seven years to get here, though, I think I can spare another few hours or so."

      "text": "Hollow Knight Silksong hands-on: 2,379 days after its reveal I finally played the elusive Metroidvania, and it is absolutely worth the wait\n2,379. That's how many days it has been since Team Cherry unveiled Hollow Knight Silksong. 339. That's the number of weeks which have been allowed to pass with near deafening silence from the developer, a void that players all across the globe have filled with endless amounts of theorycraft and anticipation. 30. That's the minutes I just spent playing a brand new Hollow Knight Silksong demo \u2013 the first of its kind since 2019.\nIf you've ever worried that Hollow Knight Silksong has accumulated so much hype that it couldn't possibly live up to the oversized expectations placed upon its shoulders, I'm here to put your mind at ease. Team Cherry is clearly operating as a studio ready to meet the challenge head-on, rather than succumb to the pressure. Which, funnily enough, is exactly the way that Silksong is able to get under your skin.\nSting like a hornet\nDeveloper: In-house\nPublisher: Team Cherry\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, XSX, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch\nRelease date: 2025\nYou either face the challenge in front of you or die trying. And you will die, over and over again. The new protagonist Hornet may be more agile and acrobatic than the insectoid warrior we previously led into the depths of the Hallownest, but the denizens stalking the Kingdom of Pharloom aren't messing around. I was able to play through sections of two areas of Hollow Knight Silksong, the Moss Grotto (a verdant stage, forming the introduction to the world) and Deep Docks (a mechanical hellscape from later in the game that proved Hollow Knight's infamous challenge spikes are still alive and well).\nWalking the Moss Grotto felt like a gentle reintroduction \u2013 simple platforming challenges and combat encounters through a lush, leafy environment. It's here where I'm able to get a real feel for Hornet's more agile moveset, made up of sharp lunges and and diagonal thrusts as she weaves around incoming projectiles. The parry window seems sharper, more intuitive. A mid-boss encounter with the Moss Mother left me feeling untouchable, as if muscle memory alone would be enough to keep me safe from harm.\nThe Deep Docks changed all of that. And it changed it real quick. This sprawling labyrinth, defined by a network of mechanical lifts and pillars of fire with absolutely brutal reset cycles, was a joy to delve into, but it really made me remember just how challenging Hollow Knight could be. Suddenly, the enemies were moving with more aggression and speed, forcing me to grapple with Hornet's ability to ping off walls, dash through small gaps in attack patterns, and quickly reposition. Just when I thought I was getting the hang of it, that's when the creatures wearing bells for helmets entered the picture \u2013 completely shutting down aerial attacks, bringing me crashing back to the ground.\nIf I've gleaned anything from my time with Hollow Knight Silksong it's that while Hornet may have a more agile moveset, movement speed is still grounded; aggression is rewarded, and indecision punished. And that the hundreds of new enemies flooding through this new world have more versatile offensive and defensive patterns to match everything that you do.\nHornet does of course have some new tricks. A limited-use 'Straight Pin' [Up + RB] acts as a light throwing tool designed for rapid attacks, while the powerful Silkspear [RB] can be encounter defining if used correctly. I didn't get enough time with this deadly Weaver technique, but it's something I'm keen to get my hands back on \u2013 the ability to throw Hornet's needle forward with force, amplified by coiled silk, is astonishingly satisfying\u2026 even if it does leave you brutally open to counter-attacks.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nSpinning thread\nI suppose if ever there was a downside to moving so undeterred through the Moss Grotto section, it's that I didn't have a chance to properly grapple with changes made to the healing system between Hollow Knight and Silksong by the time the difficulty spiked. Where you had to charge to regain a single hit-point of health in Hollow Knight, Hornet has the ability to refill three hit-points almost instantly in Silksong. The trick, of course, is that your 'Silk' gauge needs to be full for you to be able to perform this 'Bind' heal, and the fastest way to do that is to re-engage in direct combat.\nThis may sound like a subtle change, but it has the potential to drastically change the way you approach every encounter \u2013 from simple screen cleaning to entire boss encounters. I was still figuring out the particulars by the time I ran into Lace, a mid-boss encounter full of neat flourishes that's been glimpsed in past trailers.\nSuffice to say, that was one challenge too great for the short time that I had to play Hollow Knight Silksong. At least this way I was able to discover that Hornet leaves a cocoon at the site of her death, which contains a full stock of 'Silk' inside, should you break it open before whatever kills you the first time starts going at you again.\nThere's only so much you can learn about a video game in 30 minutes. But here's what I can tell you with certainty: Hollow Knight Silksong is a real video game that is clearly going to release imminently. There's an attention to detail in its visual and audio design that's scintillating to experience. The play itself is smooth, Hollow Knight's occasional sharp edges sanded down to ensure that movement and motion is the star. And then there's the changes to combat, skills, and equipment; certainly worthy of more dissection and introspection that I can reasonably provide here, but it's clear that Team Cherry is pushing for subtle revisions that will have big impacts.\nThere's probably a world in which I sign off this Hollow Knight Silksong preview by making the sort of comparison that I really dislike. \"Silksong is to Hollow Knight what Bloodborne was to Dark Souls.\" The words are tumbling onto the keyboard and I can't seem to stop them. What I mean by this unhelpful shorthand is that Silksong is building smartly on exceptionally solid foundations, and it's doing so with a greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making. I only played 30 minutes of Hollow Knight Silksong, and now I'm desperate for that to transform into 30 hours.\nTo read articles from the GamesRadar+ Autumn Preview, head on over to our Gamescom 2025 coverage hub.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Hollow Knight Silksong: Everything we know so far\nSeptember is here, meaning Hollow Knight Silksong is just around the corner\nAt long last, Hollow Knight: Silksong's release week has arrived. The news that Team Cheery had set its official release date by way of a \"special announcement\" video was staggering enough at the time, but now that it's finally September, we are literally counting the hours until the new Metroidvania is in our hands. We've also just learned that Silksong will cost just $20 at launch, making it just five bucks more expensive than its predecessor. In a time where game prices seem to be on the rise, it's a welcome reprieve for sure.\nSilksong has been an incredibly long time coming. The hotly-anticipated sequel to one of the best Metroidvania games has been on our radar since 2019, and even before a semblance of a release date was known by the public, the new game had garnered a passionate community that would stay with it throughout the lengthy development cycle.\nAnd Team Cherry knew how to keep us guessing. Silksong made many a guest appearance over the years, such as the time it popped up during the reveal of the Asus ROG Ally, during the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, and with a demo in the Gamescom 2025 schedule. As we approach the release date, here's a full breakdown of everything you need to know about Hollow Knight: Silksong before you hop into the fray for yourself!\nHollow Knight Silksong release date confirmed\nThe Hollow Knight Silksong release date is set for September 4, 2025, with release times confirmed in a follow-up Tweet:\n- 7AM Pacific Time\n- 10AM Eastern,\n- 4PM Europe (CEST)\n- 11PM in Japan\nTeam Cherry put out a special Silksong release date announcement video following a brief mention that it was \"definitely coming in 2025\" during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025. It's so close we can almost touch it.\nThe release date has been a long time coming. Originally, Silksong was set for an early 2023 target before getting pushed back. Team Cherry's Matthew Griffin confirmed the initial delay back in the day, noting in a statement that while \"development is still continuing,\" the scope of the project requires more time. \"We're excited by how the game is shaping up, and it's gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can,\" added Griffin.\nIn March 2025, we also heard word from a brief teaser from Xbox that Silksong is still counted as one of its upcoming games to look forward to. In this statement, the game was next to a collection of 2025 titles. Roll on September!\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nHollow Knight Silksong platforms\nThe Hollow Knight: Silksong platforms have been confirmed as Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and PC \u2013 via Steam, GOG, and the Humble Store.\nFollowing the Switch 2 Direct in April 2025, it was clarified that Silksong will be coming to Nintendo's current and next-gen consoles, which is certainly exciting for those planning to get their hands on a Switch 2 this year.\nHollow Knight: Silksong on Game Pass confirmed\nIt's also been confirmed that Hollow Knight: Silksong on Game Pass is coming Day One, meaning that those with a subscription will be able to play the upcoming Metroidvania as soon as it releases on September 4, provided you have an Ultimate or PC Game Pass plan.\nHollow Knight Silksong trailer\nAbove you can watch the debut Hollow Knight: Silksong reveal trailer, which Team Cherry used to announce the game to the world for the very first time all the way back in February 2019.\nThe two-minute trailer began with Hornet's kidnapping, showing her breaking free to explore lush meadows and dank underground passageways. The trailer showed there are new enemies to conquer, new bosses to fight, brand new friends to meet along the way, and new towns to explore, complete with NPC characters and their associated quests.\nHollow Knight Silksong gameplay\nAs for Hollow Knight: Silksong's gameplay, initially, the only footage we had to go off was from the debut trailer. That is, until Gamescom 2025! We recently had the opportunity to experience a Silksong hands-on (which you can also watch in video format above) and played the game for 30 minutes. During that time, the game played much like you'd expect after watching the teasers, with Hornet jumping into action, as she bounds and leaps over enemies with finesse.\nHollow Knight's blend of platforming and 2D combat is returning for Silksong. In fact, Team Cherry has made the platforming distinctly more acrobatic with Hornet than with the Knight in the original game: the new protagonist is akin to a gymnast compared to the Knight, deftly flipping over huge enemies with ease.\nOur time with the game was a marvel. We got to play two stages: the Moss Grotto (a verdant stage, forming the introduction to the world) and Deep Docks (a mechanical hellscape from later in the game). Difficulty definitely spikes just like the previous title, as the Deep Docks had us dying multiple times as we had to think quickly on our feet and go from simple platforming to watching all of Hornet's tricks be thwarted by enemies in the blink of an eye.\nHealing also works differently in Silksong than in Hollow Knight. Instead of slowly refilling her health like the Knight did, Hornet can instantly heal three health nodes, and not only that, but she can also do this on the move. However, Hornet has a Silk meter, and healing three nodes of health immediately empties the bar.\nHollow Knight Silksong story\nIf you've played Hollow Knight, you'll no doubt remember Hornet, who frequently got in the way of the player character, but ended up becoming their ally partway through. Hollow Knight: Silksong actually switches out protagonists, replacing the Knight with Hornet for this new adventure.\nIn this new game, Hornet finds herself kidnapped, and spirited away to a kingdom called Pharloom. Said to be \"haunted by Silk and Song\" according to developer Team Cherry themselves, Silksong's basic plot puts Hornet right at the bottom of this new kingdom, and tasks her with ascending to the top of the kingdom and reaching a shining citadel to find out the truth behind her kidnapping.\nAdditionally, there's also going to be side quests for Hornet to take on. These sound a lot more fleshed out than in the original Hollow Knight, as Silksong actually allows you to keep track of all your side quests in a journal. Perhaps this is an opportunity to tell more stories outside of the main plot of Silksong.\nHollow Knight Silksong development\nHollow: Knight: Silksong actually began development as another DLC chapter for the original Hollow Knight. Set to star Hornet, developer Team Cherry quickly realized the scope of the DLC was far bigger than they anticipated, so they actually carved out the space for a full-blown sequel starring Hornet instead.\nLooking at the sequel now, it's not hard to see why. Hollow Knight: Silksong's debut trailer boasted of over 150 brand new enemies, including new bosses to fight in addition to this. In fact, there's brand new features for the sequel, like the ability to craft weapons, tools, and traps from materials gathered off of fallen enemies.\nIf you liked the music of the original game, then we've got good news for you, too. Original composer Christopher Larkin has returned to collaborate with Team Cherry to score Hollow Knight: Silksong, which means the new adventure promises to have memorable tunes for punchy moments.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg following the release date announcement, Team Cherry spoke on the long development, confirming that there \"wasn't any big controversial moment\" behind it taking almost seven years to make, but that it was rather down to the fact that they were a small team and they needed the development time to ensure they brought to life a game they wanted to make.\nTeam Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson also mentioned the initial plans for DLC and how that then expanded into the full-blown sequel we're set to see arrive in September.\n\"[W]e were recognizing that it [the then DLC] was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of Hollow Knight or probably exceed it,\" Gibson said. \"And then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.\"\nHollow Knight: Silksong DLC\nTeam Cherry has already teased plans for possible Hollow Knight: Silksong DLC.\nIn the aforementioned Bloomberg interview, co-founder Gibson spoke on the development following the release date news, and expressed excitement for what's to come after.\n\"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,\" Ari Gibson said. \"We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.\"\n\"Launching it is obviously quite exciting,\" Team Cherry's William Pellen also said. \"What comes after for us is equally as exciting.\"\nCan't stand the wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong?
