  "title": "Caitlin Clark injury update: Fever guard ruled out Tuesday vs Wings, Paige Bueckers",
  "description": "Caitlin Clark won't make her highly anticipated return on the court on Tuesday against the Dallas Wings. Here's the latest:",
  "content": "All eyes are on Caitlin Clark's injury status after the Indiana Fever's depth chart took yet another hit, but the All-Star won't be making her highly anticipated return on the court on Tuesday, Aug. 12 against the Dallas Wings.\n\nFever point guards Sydney Colson (left ACL tear) and Aari McDonald (broken right foot) were both ruled out the remainder of the season after sustaining injuries in the Fever's loss to the Phoenix Mercury on Aug. 7, further depleting Indiana's depth at the point guard position amid Clark's extended absence.\n\nClark last suited up for the Fever on July 15, when she suffered a right groin injury in Indiana's 85-77 win over the Connecticut Sun. She subsequently missed 10 games, which will grow after Clark was ruled out of the Fever's matchup against the Dallas Wings on Tuesday, marking her 11th consecutive missed game.\n\nHead coach Stephanie White said that, although Clark has progressed in her recovery and has started running full court again, she hasn't returned to practice just yet: an important step in her ramp-up.\n\n\"She's been able to get a little bit more in her full-court running with all of her body weight,\" White said on Monday, Aug. 11. \"She's been able to do a little more on the court in terms of how she moves, but not into practice yet.\"\n\nHere's the latest on Clark's injury and her expected return to the court:\n\nClark was ruled out of the Indiana Fever's matchup against the Wings in Indianapolis on Tuesday with a right groin injury. There is no timetable for Clark's return.\n\nThe game is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET (4:30 p.m. PT) and will be televised on ESPN.\n\nClark suffered a right groin injury in the final minute of the Fever's 85-77 victory over the Sun at TD Garden in Boston on July 15. With 39.1 seconds remaining in the contest, Clark completed a bounce pass to Kelsey Mitchell to put the Fever up 84-75. After the pass, Clark immediately grabbed for her right groin and grimaced as she gingerly walked over and headbutted the stanchion. She did not return to the game.\n\nHow many games has Caitlin Clark missed this season?\n\nClark, who previously missed time due to a left quad injury and a left groin injury, has missed 19 of the Fever's 32 games so far this season. Tuesday's matchup against the Sparks will mark her 20th total absence. She also missed the Fever's Commissioner's Cup win over the Minnesota Lynx on July 1, in addition to the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game and the 3-point competition held in Indianapolis.\n\nIndiana is 8-5 with Clark in the lineup and 10-9 without her on the floor.\n\u2022 May 24: Clark suffered a left quad injury during the Fever's 90-88 loss to the New York Liberty, where she recorded a double-double with 18 points and 10 assists. Clark couldn't pinpoint the specific play that caused her injury, but noted that it happened early in the contest. Clark said, \"Adrenaline covers up a lot of stuff when you're in the heat of battle. After the game, I had some pain, and then we got an MRI, and that kind of gave me the result that I didn't want to see.\" She missed the Fever's next five games.\n\u2022 June 14: Clark returned to Indiana's lineup in the Fever's 102-88 win over the Liberty and dropped 32 points, nine assists and eight rebounds in her first game back.\n\u2022 June 24: Clark suffered a left groin injury in the Fever's 94-86 win over the Seattle Storm, which resulted in Clark missing the team's next four games. Head coach Stephanie White said she learned of Clark's groin injury the following night after Clark alerted team trainers of discomfort.\n\u2022 July 1: Clark was ruled out of the Fever's 2025 Commissioner's Cup win over the Minnesota Lynx in Minneapolis. That didn't stop Clark from rightfully celebrating the team's hardware.\n\u2022 July 9: Clark returned to the Fever's lineup in the Fever's 80-61 loss to the Golden State Valkyries. Clark was limited to 10 points, shooting 4 of 12 from the field and 2 of 5 from the 3-point line, in addition to six assists, five rebounds and four turnovers. Following the blowout loss, Clark said it was \"going to take me a second to get my wind back. ... Just trying to get my legs under me.\"\n\u2022 July 15: Clark suffered a right groin injury in the final minute of the Fever's 85-77 victory over the Sun at TD Garden in Boston. White later confirmed Clark \"felt a little something in her groin.\" This marked the last game for which Clark suited up.\n\u2022 July 18: Clark announced that she would sit out the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game in Indianapolis, where she was named a team captain. Clark was also set to participate in the 3-point contest. She said, \"I am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can't participate ... I have to rest my body.\"\n\u2022 July 24: The Fever said Clark's medical evaluations confirmed there's \"no additional injuries or damage,\" but the team said it will be cautious with Clark's rehab and recovery.\n\u2022 August 8: During an appearance on Sue Bird's podcast, \"Bird's Eye View,\" Clark spoke about the frustrations of her injury-filled season: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a training camp to build up to play in my first game again. It\u2019s like no, you\u2019re tossed into Game 30 \u2014 like, \u2018Go try to play well.\u2019 It\u2019s hard, it really is.\u201d\n\nClark is averaging 16.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and a career-high 8.8 assists in 13 games this season. Her assists average is the second-highest in the league, behind Phoenix's Alyssa Thomas (9.0).\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.

Though she didn't play, she was still part of the reason that Indiana made it to the championship game, and she rightfully deserved to celebrate.\nSo, that meant the Indiana star got the pleasure of slamming a celebratory beer \u2015 Quite literally. She threw the can to the floor after she drank it \u2015 with her Fever teammates in honor of their huge victory.\nIf you thought Clark's hysterical shenanigans stopped there, they did not.\nShe was seemingly the ringleader of getting her teammates to drink beer, too. Clark held the Commissioner's Cup trophy as multiple teammates sipped from it. She even wholesomely double-checked that rookie Makyala Timpson was of legal age to consume alcohol before letting her have some.\nAt some point, the team also hopped on Instagram Live to troll the rest of the league, which totally tracks. Clark is notoriously competitive, and if anyone loses to her, they're probably going to hear about it.\n\"Guys, I just know everybody else in the league is sick,\" she told her teammates.\n\"They're pissed\", center Aliyah Boston chimed in, agreeing.\n(Warning: very NSFW music playing in the video below.)\nWhat a night for Clark and the Fever."

      "text": "Caitlin Clark suffers apparent injury late in Fever win over Sun: Score, highlights\nThe Indiana Fever grinded out a tough road win over the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday despite an off night from Caitlin Clark, but the win may end up being bittersweet as Clark appeared to suffer an injury in the final seconds.\nThe Fever held on for an 85-77 victory over the Sun to improve to 12-10 on the season after seven lead changes and 10 total ties in the matchup, which was moved to the TD Garden in Boston to accommodate the sold-out crowd that included the likes of Boston Celtics superstar Jaylen Brown.\nClark finished with 14 points in the win, shooting 4-of-14 from the field and 1-of-7 from 3. She was held to five points through three quarters, but exploded for nine points in the fourth quarter to help Indiana pull away from the Sun. But the Fever's celebration was short-lived after Clark appeared to suffer an injury in the final minute.\nWith 39.1 seconds remaining in the contest, Clark completed a bounce pass to Kelsey Mitchell to go up 84-75, tying the Fever's largest lead of the game. After the pass, Clark immediately grabbed for her groin, grimaced and head-butted the stanchion in frustration. She did not return to the game.\nIt's the latest blow for Clark, who is still looking to find her rhythm after a left groin injury and left quad strain sidelined her a total of 10 games. Clark's status in the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game and 3-point contest in Indianapolis could also be in jeopardy.\nKelsey Mitchell finished with a team-high 20 points, while Natasha Howard added 18 points and 13 rebounds.\nTina Charles finished with a game-high 21 points and added 11 rebounds in the loss, marking her league-leading 198th double-double of her career. The 36-year-old veteran now has four 20-point, 10-rebound games this season, tied for the most in the league.\nIndiana Fever vs. Connecticut Sun highlights\nEnd of Q3: Fever 62, Sun 60\nAhead of the fourth quarter, Sun veteran Tina Charles said Connecticut plans to \"keep making it hard for Caitlin (Clark), she\u2019s the heart of the snake.\" The Sun have done just that and trail by just two points after three quarters.\nClark has been held to five points against the Sun and missed all five of her shot attempts in the third quarter. She's shooting 2-of-10 from the field and 0-of-5 from 3 on the day, continuing a troubling slump on the road. She's 1-of-33 from the 3-point line on the road this season.\nNatasha Howard and Kelsey Mitchell have a team-high 17 points for the Fever. Aliyah Boston has three points. Meanwhile, Charles has a game-high 18 points, 11 rebounds and two assists for the Sun, who are looking for their fourth win of the season.\nCaitlin Clark held back from referee\nClark's shooting woes have continued and her frustrations appeared to boil over in the third quarter. Clark had to be held back by team personnel after her chat with referee Mike Price went awry during the Sun's coach's challenge on an out-of-bounds call. It's not clear what Clark was upset about, but shooting a disappointing 2-of-8 from the field and 1-of-2 from 3 surely isn't helping.\nJaylen Brown in the building\nTuesday's matchup between the Fever and Sun marks only the second WNBA game to take place at TD Garden in Boston, home of the 2024 NBA champion Boston Celtics. So it's only right that Celtics superstar Jaylen Brown is in attendance. Brown sat courtside during the sold-out game and stopped to take some pictures with fans.\nHalftime: Fever 44, Sun 42\nThe Fever have a two-point advantage over the Sun at halftime after a back-and-forth first half that featured seven lead changes between both teams.\nThe Fever are shooting 52.9% from the field, compared to the Sun's 41.9%, but Indiana has been outrebounded 23-16. Turnovers are also starting to build up with six in the first half, three of which belong to Caitlin Clark. Clark's road woes have continued in Boston and she's been held to five points (2-of-5 FG, 0-of-2 3PT). Natasha Howard leads all scorers with 12 points and six rebounds, while Kelsey Mitchell added 11 points.\nMeanwhile, Tina Charles has set the intensity for her team. Charles, the league's second-leading scorer of all time, has 11 points, seven rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. The Sun's bench added 13 points.\nEnd of Q1: Fever 29, Sun 28\nThe Fever opened Tuesday\u2019s contest against the Sun red-hot and collectively shot 8-of-8 from the field and 1-of-1 from 3 to build a nine-point lead over the Sun. Connecticut, however, responded with an 11-3 run to take the lead, 28-27, with 54.2 seconds remaining.\nThe Fever regained the lead with a pair of free throws from Aari McDonald to close the quarter.\nNatasha Howard has a team-high 10 points and four rebounds for the Fever after one quarter. Meanwhile, Tina Charles is doing a little bit of everything for the Sun with nine points, three rebounds, one steal and one block.\nThe Sun applied early pressure on Caitlin Clark, picking her up full-court and sending early double teams, but Clark was able to efficiently distribute the ball to her teammates in the paint each time. She's up to two points and four assists.\nWhat time is Fever vs. Sun?\nThe Indiana Fever's WNBA game on Tuesday, July 15 at the Connecticut Sun is scheduled to tip off at 8 p.m. ET at TD Garden in Boston.\nHow to watch Fever vs. Sun: TV, stream for Caitlin Clark\n- Date: Tuesday, July 15\n- Time: 8 p.m. ET\n- Location: TD Garden (Boston)\n- TV: ESPN\n- Stream: Fubo\nIndiana Fever starting lineup\nThe Fever's starting five consists of Caitlin Clark, forward Aliyah Boston, Kelsey Mitchell, Natasha Howard and Lexie Hull. This unit has made eight starts together this season heading into Tuesday and gone 5-3.\nConnecticut Sun starting lineup\nCaitlin Clark will participate in WNBA All-Star 3-point contest\nAhead of the 2025 WNBA All-Star game, where Caitlin Clark will serve as a team captain, the 2024 Rookie of the Year will compete in Friday's WNBA STARRY 3-Point Contest. The field is rounded out by Washington Mystics guard Sonia Citron, Atlanta Dream guard Allisha Gray, New York Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu and Los Angeles Sparks guard Kelsey Plum\n\"It\u2019s exciting. I\u2019ve never participated in a 3-point competition or practiced before, so just go out there and have fun,\" Clark said on Tuesday in her pregame press conference. \"I think the lineup of people competing is tremendous so more than anything, it\u2019s going to be great for our league and for women\u2019s basketball as a whole.\"\nClark is shooting 28.9% from 3 this season, down from her average of 34.4% last year, and is looking to snap out of a shooting slump. She has shot 23-of-74 from the field and 6-of-35 from beyond the arc in the past five games as she's dealt with left leg injuries."

      "text": "Caitlin Clark to miss WNBA All-Star Game and 3-point contest because of groin injury\nThe Indiana Fever announced Caitlin Clark will not participate in the WNBA All-Star Game or the 3-point competition after injuring her right groin in the Fever's win over the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday.\nThe 2025 WNBA All-Star game will be held in Indianapolis for the first time in league history, with Clark, Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell selected to represent the Indiana Fever, tying the Seattle Storm for the most All-Star representatives this year. The untimely injury, however, has thrown a wrench into things.\n\"I am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can't participate in the 3-Point contest or the All-Star Game. I have to rest my body.\" Clark said. \"I will still be at Gainbridge Fieldhouse for all the action and I'm looking forward to helping Sandy (Liberty coach Brondello) coach our team to a win.\"\nFever head coach Stephanie White said \"Caitlin and her team\" ultimately made the decision to prioritize her long-term health after missing 11 total games with various injuries, including a left groin injury and left quad strain.\nClark was set to be the centerpiece of the All-Star weekend in Indianapolis. She was named a captain after receiving the most fan votes and drafted teammates Boston (starter) and Mitchell (reserve) to her team. Clark said they planned on making this \"the best All-Star that the WNBA has ever had,\" but she will now be cheering on her team from the sidelines as they face Team Napheesa Collier.\n\"It's a big deal for us to have All-Star in Indianapolis, of course with Caitlin being a focal point of all that,\" White said on Thursday. \"As the coach of the Indiana Fever, it's not a bigger deal than our long-term season.\"\nWhat happened?\nClark appeared to injure her groin in the final minute of the Fever's 85-77 win over the Sun on Tuesday in Boston. After a bounce pass to Kelsey Mitchell for a layup with 39.1 seconds remaining, Clark held the inside of her right thigh before walking over and banging her head against the stanchion in apparent frustration. Clark walked to the Fever bench, where she put a towel over her head.\nWhite confirmed Clark \"felt a little something in her groin.\" She was subsequently ruled out of the Fever's road matchup against the New York Liberty on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe most important thing for us is to keep her upbeat, continue to support her and let her know we got her back and let her know we\u2019re going to go battle for her,\u201d White said. \"Being injured and continuing to have setbacks is frustrating. Mentally, emotionally.\"\nWho will replace Caitlin Clark?\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert selected replacements for Clark and Phoenix Mercury star Satou Sabally (ankle) on Thursday, July 17. Washington Mystics guard Brittney Sykes and Atlanta Dream forward Brionna Jones were added to the Team Clark roster.\nMinnesota Lynx guard Kayla McBride was added as a replacement for the Dream's Rhyne Howard earlier this week. Howard, who was selected to Team Collier, suffered a left knee injury during the Dream's July 11 game against the Fever.

      "text": "Fever vs. Liberty highlights: Score as Caitlin Clark, Indiana lose close game to NY\nCaitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever played the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty Saturday afternoon in Indianapolis in a nationally televised game that came down to the final moments.\nThe Fever have started the season 2-1, following an 81-76 victory over the Atlanta Dream on Thursday. Clark had 11 points, six assists and four rebounds in the victory. But she went 0-for-5 from the 3-point line, ending her streak of 140 games (counting WNBA and college) with at least one 3-pointer. The Fever ultimately lost Saturday's game to the Liberty, 90-88.\nHere\u2019s how it all went down between the Fever and Liberty on Saturday with final score and highlights:\nNew York vs. Indiana final: Liberty 90, Fever 88\nJonquel Jones scored 26 points and Sabrina Ionescu added 23, including the game-winning free throws with 2.2 seconds left, leading four players in double figures as the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty stormed back from a 12-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Indiana Fever 90-88 on Saturday.\nThe Fever had a chance at a game-winning play but did not get a shot attempt off.\nJones hit 9-15 from the field and also had 12 rebounds.\nFever guard Caitlin Clark overcame her first-half struggles to score 18 points after missing her first six three-point shots before drilling one with 1:04 left in the third quarter while getting fouled and hitting another long jumper from downtown to beat the buzzer, sending the Gainbridge Fieldhouse crowd, which included Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle and guard Tyrese Haliburton, into a frenzy. The reigning WNBA rookie of the year also added 10 assists and five rebounds, but also turned the ball over 10 times.\nThe Fever (2-2) took control in the third, outscoring the Liberty 30-13, while the Liberty went ice cold after shooting 64% from the field in the first half.\nIndiana led by double digits before New York started to chip away in the fourth quarter, cutting the lead to one with 13-2 run capped by a Jones 3-pointer with 5:34 left.\nAliyah Boston had 27 points and 12 rebounds, while Kelsey Mitchell and Lexie Hull, who got her first start of the season, each scored 15 points for Indiana and trailed by 15 in the first half.\nNew York vs. Indiana score 3rd quarter: Fever 76, Liberty 68\nThe Fever used a strong third quarter 12-4 run to cut the Liberty\u2019s halftime lead, outscoring the Liberty 30-13 in the third while Caitlin Clark (16 points, 10 assists, 4 rebounds, 8 turnovers) came alive after struggling on the offensive end as she missed her last 12 three-point attempts, before hitting a stepback three-pointer with 1:04 left while getting fouled and hitting another long jumper from downtown to beat the buzzer. Aliyah Boston is pacing the Fever with 23 points on 11-12 from the field and Kelsey Mitchell added nine in the quarter. Sabrina Ionescu has 19 points, even as the Liberty went cold in the third quarter, while Indiana is shooting 54%.\nNew York vs. Indiana score halftime: Liberty 55, Fever 46\nThe defending champions used an 18-1 run in the second quarter to take control of the game, building a 15-point lead, while continuing their torrid shooting start, hitting 64% from the field. Sabrina Ionescu led four New York players in double figures with 15 points. Breanna Stewart added 12 points, with Jonquel Jones and Natasha Cloud each adding 10 points.\nAliyah Boston had 17 points and five rebounds for Indiana, and Caitlin Clark has seven points, eight assists, and six turnovers but went 0-5 from the 3-point line after missing all five from the 3-point line in Thursday\u2019s victory against Atlanta.\nNew York vs. Indiana score Q1: Liberty 30, Fever 29\nFor two teams that like to shoot from the outside, the first quarter mostly had the Fever and Liberty scoring from the inside. Breanna Stewart had 10 points for New York, Jonquel Jones and Sabrina Ionescu added eight points each and Aliyah Boston did her work in the paint with 10 points, while Caitlin Clark scored seven points, to go along with six assists, but also has turned the ball over four times. The Fever scored 20 of its 29 points in the paint, while shooting 71% from the field.\nNew York shot 64% in the quarter and hit two of its five three-point attempts after making 19 3\u2019s, setting a WNBA single game regular season record, in their last game against the Chicago Sky. Starters from both teams, Caitlin Clark, Natasha Howard, Kelsey Mitchell and Lexie Hull for Indiana and New York\u2019s Leonie Fiebich, each committed two fouls in the first quarter\nPacers Tyrese Haliburton courtside watching Caitlin Clark, Fever\nThe Pacers guard made an appearance at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse to cheer on the Fever after Indiana took a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks on Friday. Haliburton had 14 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds in the 114-109 victory.\nHow to watch Fever vs. Liberty game: TV, stream\n- Time: 1 p.m. ET\n- Location: Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis\n- TV: CBS\n- Stream: Paramount+, Fubo (free trial)\nFever vs. Liberty starting lineups\nIndiana Fever\n- G -Caitlin Clark\n- G -Kelsey Mitchell\n- G - Lexie Hull\n- F - Natasha Howard\n- C - Aliyah Boston\nNew York Liberty\n- G - Natasha Cloud\n- G - Sabrina Ionescu\n- F - Leonie Fiebich\n- F - Breanna Stewart\n- F - Jonquel Jones\nWhat time is Fever vs. Liberty?\nThe Indiana Fever vs. New York Liberty game will tip off at 1 p.m. ET on Saturday, May 24, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.\nWatch Fever vs. Liberty on Fubo (free trial)\nFever vs. Liberty odds:\nThe New York Liberty are favored to beat the Indiana Fever, according to BetMGM.\nOdds as of Saturday, May 24.\n- Spread: Liberty (-3.5)\n- Moneyline: Liberty (-185), Fever (+150)\n- Over/under: 173.5\nLiberty vs. Fever predictions:\nDraftKings Network: New York Liberty to win\nCharlie Cummings writes, \"Ultimately, the Liberty\u2019s overwhelming defense and the star power of Ionescu, Breanna Stewart, and Jonquel Jones will overtake this Indiana squad. There\u2019s only so much you can do against a team this good.\"\nCBS Sports: New York Liberty -4 (-110)\nRyan Wooden writes, \"The Fever have shown improvement early in the season and have home court, but Wetzel believes New York is still a cut above after it beat the Aces and the Sky by a combined 39 points. Liberty newcomer Natasha Cloud has averaged 20 points, 8.5 assists and 5.0 rebounds per game.\"\nAction Network: Best Bet - Aliyah Boston Under 15.5 Points (-140)\nJim Turvey writes, \"Aliyah Boston has gotten off to a strong start in the new Fever offense, but there's a lot pointing to the under on Saturday. For one, it's a matchup with the best defense (the New York Liberty), with a defensive frontcourt that's hands down the best in the WNBA.\n\"Boston also has seen her points per game average jump by 1.7 this season, but her field goal attempts actually have dropped by 0.5. Part of that increased efficiency could be her talented teammates providing more space, but even if that's the case, her 59/50/80 shooting splits won't continue.\""

      "text": "2025 WNBA All-Star Game highlights: Team Collier dominates with record-setting performance\nThe 2025 WNBA All-Star Game may have been held in Indianapolis for the first time, but Team Napheesa Collier wasn't going to let Team Caitlin Clark reign victorious in front of a sold-out crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\nTeam Collier recorded the most points ever scored in a WNBA All-Star game with a dominant 151-131 defeat of Team Clark on Saturday. Team Collier was led by an MVPhee performance from the captain, who scored 36 points with nine rebounds to break Arike Ogunbowale's previous WNBA All-Star game scoring record (34) set in 2024. Collier's extensive bag was on display and she dropped multiple 4-point shots deep from the logo. (It's worth noting there wasn't a 4-point shot in the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game.)\nCollier was named the WNBA All-Star MVP. She credited her \"amazing teammates.\" Collier used her MVP speech to highlight the importance of the upcoming CBA negotiations. \"I see a bunch of strong women who aren't going to back down and fight for what we want. ... I couldn't do it without them,\" Collier said.\n2025 WNBA ALL-STAR FRIDAY RESULTS: Sabrina Ionescu wins 3-point contest; Liberty sweep\nTeam Collier dominated from the 4-point line, one of four special rules in play for the All-Star game. Allisha Gray added 18 points for Team Collier, while Kelsey Plum and Nneka Ogwumike had 16 points. Skylar Diggins recorded the first triple-double in a WNBA All-Star game, finishing with 11 points, 15 assists (the most in a WNBA All-Star game) and 11 rebounds.\nDiggins said she was inspired by her last-place finish in the WNBA Skills Challenge on Friday. \"I was pissed I got last in the skills challenge. ... I knew I wanted to leave here with something.\"\nClark didn't participate in the matchup after suffering a right groin injury in the Fever's win over the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday, but she coached alongside New York Liberty head coach Sandy Brondello and was vocal from the sideline. Kelsey Mitchell had a team-high 20 points for Team Clark, while Brittney Sykes and Gabby Williams added 16 points each.\nUSA TODAY Sports recapped the 2025 WNBA All-Star game. Here's what you missed:\nWNBA All-Star Game highlights\nCrowd chants 'Pay Them!'\nThe crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse booed WNBA Commissioner Cathy Englebert and chanted \"Pay Them! Pay Them!\" as she presented the All-Star MVP trophy to Napheesa Collier at the conclusion of the game.\nStud Budz are the WNBA All-Star's real MVPs\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Walking the halls in the bowels of Gainbridge Arena before the the WNBA All-Star Game on Saturday, Minnesota Lynx guard Natisha Hiedeman is omnipresent.\nOne half of the the \"Stud Budz,\" Hiedman and her Lynx teammate Courtney Williams \u2014 who both have pink hair \u2014 started a live stream on Twitch a couple of months ago and have spent All-Star weekend giving the fans a behind the scenes look at W. Their Twitch bio describes the steam as \"just two Stud Budz who hoop and live our best life.\"\n\"It really started off as two friends, we knew about twitch, and said, 'Let\u2019s just start streaming,'\" Hiedeman said, not pausing the stream to do an interview with USA TODAY Studio IX. \"It\u2019s a platform that\u2019s unique, that really no one in the W has touched, so we was like, 'Let\u2019s be the first ones.'\" \u2014 Heather Burns\nEnd of Q3: Team Collier 119, Team Clark 95\nTeam Collier has a 24-point lead heading into the fourth and final quarter, led by 30 points and six rebounds from team captain Napheesa Collier. Kelsey Plum added 16 points, while Kayla McBride and Nneka Ogwumike have 11.\nTeam Collier has knocked down 10-of-23 shots from a designated \u201cAT&T 4-Point Shot\u201d area, while Team Clark has shot 4-of-24 from the 4-point areas.\nKelsey Mtichell and Kayla Thornton lead Team Clark with 13 points each. Brittney Sykes has 12 points and Brionna Jones added 11 points.\nHalftime: Team Collier 82, Team Clark 60\nNapheesa Collier is putting on an MV-Phee performance. The All-Star team captain has a game-high 18 points at halftime as her team leads 82-60. Collier is getting it done at all levels, scoring in the paint and even knocking down two shots from the 4-Point range. Her teammate Kelsey Plum added 14-points off the bench, while Nneka Ogwumike added nine points.\n\"We want to blow them out,\" Plum said. \"We're a lot better than them. I hate to say it.\"\nThe difference in the game has been the 4-point shot, which Team Collier has capitalized on. Collier's team is shooting 35.7% from beyond the arc through two quarters.\n\"We haven\u2019t made as many as them. You don\u2019t realize how fast 4-point shots add up. We didn\u2019t take that into account. They\u2019ve made quite a few. (Napheesa Collier), (Kayla) McBride. We got to slow them down,\" Clark said. When asked about what halftime message she has for her team down 22 points, Clark said she has none. \"We're going to listen to Glorilla and get a drink... of Gatorade.\"\nKayla Thornton has a team-high 10 points off the bench for Team Clark. Kiki Iriafen has nine points, while Gabby Williams and Sabrina Ionescu each have eight points.\nDefense has been nonexistent in the first half, but will surely pick up in the second half. The record for the most points scored in a single WNBA All-Star Game belongs to Arike Ogunbowale, who scored 34 points en route an MVP award in the 2024 All-Star Game.\nWhere is the 2026 WNBA All-Star weekend?\nThe location for the 2026 WNBA All-Star game has not been unveiled yet.\nVeteran Nneka Ogwumike sets WNBA All-Star record\nNneka Ogwumike continues to climb up the all-time lists. The Seattle Storm forward earned her 10th All-Star selection, joining Sue Bird (13), Diana Taurasi (11), Tamika Catchings (10) and Brittney Griner (10) as the only players in WNBA history to receive 10 All-Star nods. Ogwumike said accomplishments like this one \"hits me a little bit more when I see the company that I am surrounded by in whatever stats people throw at me.\"\nOgwumike is up to 11 points in the All-Star game, shooting 5-of-6 from the field and 1-of-1 from three. She made her 55th career field goal in an All-Star Game, officially passing Maya Moore for the most field goals made in WNBA All-Star history.\nTyrese Haliburton, Lisa Leslie in the building\nThe star-studded crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Friday includes Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton, who has been a mainstay at Fever home games. The crowd also includes Hall of Famers Lisa Leslie, Dawn Staley and Tamika Catching, in addition to Robin Roberts, Flau'jae Johnson, rapper Plies and Bam Adebayo.\nEnd of Q1: Team Collier 49, Team Clark 36\nTeam Collier's Kelsey Plum has a game-high 12 points off the bench as Team Collier has a 49-36 lead over Team Clark through the first quarter. Paige Bueckers of Team Collier got the scoring started at the 2025 WNBA All-Star game with a 4-point shot.\nSpeaking of the 4-point shots, Team Clark's Sabrina Ionescu picked up right where she left off. One night after winning the WNBA All-Star 3-point competition, Ionescu knocked down two 4-point shots from the \u201cAT&T 4-Point Shot\u201d area on the court, totaling a team-high eight points in the first quarter. \"I feel like I tried to in the regular season... might as well go for it,\" Ionescu said during a game break.\nWNBA four point shot explained\nThe 4-point shot is back.

The second half of the season promptly starts on Tuesday, offering All-Stars little to no time to regroup and recover from the festivities.\n\u201cWe joke about winning but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not that serious. We\u2019re going to have a fun time,\u201d coach Clark said ahead of the game. Collier added, \u201cI wasn\u2019t telling (my team) anything about preparing for the game. We were preparing to be on 'StudBudz'\u2026 This is supposed to be our break. We all play Tuesday.\u201d\nLast year, WNBA teams got nearly a month off after the 2024 All-Star game between Team WNBA and the U.S. women's national basketball team to accommodate for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Englebert said it is.\n\"We\u2019ve been talking about diff ways to do rev sharing,\" she said. \"There is rev sharing in our existing CBA that is expiring after this season. But we were at a very diff place in 2020 than we are in 2025. ...It\u2019s a balance between those twos. There is a proposal on both sides on revenue sharing.\"\nCaitlin Clark, WNBA All-Stars arrive\nCaitlin Clark is in the building.

USA TODAY Sports is tracking every fashionable entrance here.\nIs Caitlin Clark playing in the All-Star game?\nNo. Clark will not participate in the All-Star Game due to a right groin injury. She also sat out of the 3-point contest on Friday.\n\"I am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can't participate in the 3-Point contest or the All-Star Game.

Following an offensive rebound, the shot clock will be reset to 14 seconds.\n- No free throws: Anytime a player is required to shoot a free throw, they will \"automatically be credited with the maximum available point(s) given the situation,\" the league explained. Free throws will only be in play in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter and in overtime.\nWho won the 2025 WNBA 3-point contest?\nNew York Liberty superstar Sabrina Ionescu remains the queen of the WNBA All-Star 3-point contest.\nIonescu, who holds the 3-point competition record in both the WNBA or NBA after scoring 37 of 40 points in 2023, took down defending champion Allisha Gray of the Atlanta Dream Friday night in the 3-point contest final with a score of 30 points. Ionescu became just the second WNBA player to win the 3-point contest multiple times, joining four-time winner Allie Quigley.\n\"It means everything. The last time I was here in (Indianapolis) against Steph (Curry), I lost, so I feel like I had to come back and redeem myself,\" Ionescu said, referring to the first-ever NBA vs. WNBA 3-point challenge during the 2024 NBA All-Star weekend in Indianapolis, where she went head-to-head with Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry. \"I feel like we put on a great show.\"\nWho won the WNBA skills challenge?\nThe 2025 WNBA Skills Challenge came down to the final second ... literally. New York Liberty guard Natasha Cloud finished the obstacle course with 1.1 seconds to spare, narrowly defeating Seattle Storm guard Erica Wheeler for the title.\nCloud becomes the second Liberty player to win the skills challenge, following Sabrina Ionescu's win in 2022. Cloud said she's going to use her $55K prize money from Aflac to put a down payment on a house with her girlfriend, Liberty teammate Isabelle Harrison.\n\"(Harrison) told me to go win this money for a home and that's what it's going down too,\" Cloud said after her win. \"I'm really grateful for where our journey's have brought us and our career have brought us.

The teams meet at 8 p.m. ET at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.\nColson and McDonald each suffered injuries during the Fever's loss to the Phoenix Mercury on Thursday, Aug. 7. Colson was injured in the first quarter of the game in Phoenix while trying to track down the basketball near the Fever's bench. McDonald left the game limping in the fourth quarter. Neither player returned.\nFor her part, Clark appeared on Sue Bird's podcast, \"Bird's Eye View,\" on Friday and spoke about the frustrations of her injury-filled season and not having a grip on when she will be able to come back. After winning Rookie of the Year in 2024, Clark has played in 13 of 32 games this season and remains out indefinitely with a right groin injury.\n\u201cObviously, there are really frustrating days and there are days where it\u2019s a little bit easier and you\u2019re very motivated and you\u2019re close to the finish line of getting back,\" Clark told Bird on the podcast.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a training camp to build up to play in my first game again. It\u2019s like no, you\u2019re tossed into game 30 \u2014 like, \u2018Go try to play well.\u2019 It\u2019s hard, it really is.\u201d\nClark is averaging 16.5 points, five rebounds and 8.8 assists while shooting 36.7% from the field, including 27.9% from 3-point range.\n\"It's just been so challenging being active, playing four games, and then not,\" Clark said. \"Not feeling the best and then frustrated of how hard I worked in the offseason and all I do is rehab and continue to do this process.\n\"That's been the hardest part, the stop-and-go of everything.\"\nClark shared that she understands how much fans enjoy seeing her play and plans to continue to travel with Indiana Fever regardless of her injury.\n\"You want to play,\" Clark said, knowing that people bought tickets for her games to get the chance to see a deep 3-pointer or amazing pass. \"But I still try and make it memorable. I am going to sign autographs for way longer when I am hurt than when I am not injured.\"\nClark started the season with a left quad injury, then injured her left groin and now the right. She said her mom texted her after the most recent setback and urged her to take the time she needs to heal.\n\"She said, 'You have given so much to the game, take some time for yourself,'\" Clark said.\nClark also eluded about her career after basketball, joking about becoming a college coach because of the lack of defense played at that level. She then talked about being on the sidelines at games, \"coaching the refs.\"\n\"I should be ref,\" she joked. \"I'd wouldn't miss a call.\""
