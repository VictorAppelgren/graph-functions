TrendForce predicts the Pro Max will also see a $100 hike to $1,299. The price bump aligns with broader cost pressures and tariff impacts, while the standard iPhone 17 is likely to stay at $799-$849. Apple’s event is slated for September 9, 2025, with pre‑orders beginning September 12 and sales on September 19.",
