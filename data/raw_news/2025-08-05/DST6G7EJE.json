  "title": "Dreame's answer to the Dyson Airwrap was a big disappointment \u2013 but if it can fix these two big issues the next version could be a winner",
  "description": "The Dreame Airstyle Pro has plenty of potential",
  "content": "I've reviewed plenty of Dyson Airwrap alternatives, but the one I was most excited to try out was the Dreame AirStyle Pro. Dreame is a relatively new brand, but is rapidly establishing itself as a key player in the home appliances space.\n\nWe've tested a number of its products in different categories, and they've consistently impressed us \u2013 the Dreame R20 sits at the top of our best cordless vacuum guide, and its X50 Ultra Complete is our favorite premium robot vacuum. And that's just a couple of examples.\n\nSo my expectations for the AirStyle were high. I'd seen it demoed at a press event, my teammate had tried it out briefly at IFA and loved it, and when my test sample arrived my first impressions were great. I thought it was a shoo-in for my best hair styler roundup.\n\nLet's start with the good bits. The dryer part is well-designed \u2013 it's comfortable to hold, well-balanced, and looks and feels high quality. The controls are intuitively placed and out-of-the-way enough that it's unlikely you'll press them accidentally, and the spring-loaded slider cool shot is especially well thought-out.\n\nThere's a great range of attachments, including those all-important auto-wrapping curl barrels (the innovation that made the original Airwrap so popular), and three different brushes for smoothing and volumizing.\n\nDreame has also added a Flyaway attachment (positioned to rival the one included with the Dyson Airwrap i.d.) and a smart-looking Fast dry attachment that blasts the air out at a right-angle to the handle, for comfortable drying. All are packaged up neatly in a stylish storage box.\n\nThe price is right too: it's still a bit of an investment, but almost exactly the same as its main Airwrap-alike competitor, the Shark FlexStyle.\n\nSo far, so good \u2013 so why did the Dreame AirStyle Pro end up being the biggest disappointment of my product reviewing year? The first (and most significant) problem is that it just doesn't get hot enough.\n\nI don't have especially long or thick hair (collarbone-length, and fine strands but quite a lot of them, for the record), but it couldn't get it dry. I spent several minutes waving the AirStyle ineffectually around my head before giving up and switching to a dedicated hair dryer \u2013 I just don't have that kind of time available in the mornings, okay?\n\nIt was so lukewarm that I wondered if I'd been sent a faulty review model, but not so \u2013 looking at Dreame's website reveals the two heat settings as 122\u00baF / 50\u00baC (medium) and 176\u00baF / 80\u00baC (high). In comparison, the Dyson Airwrap i.d.'s maximum heat setting is 194\u00baF / 90\u00baC.\n\nThe lack of heat is frustrating when you're in a rush and need to dry your hair efficiently, but it has a bigger problem for this kind of styler, too. You need a certain amount of initial heat to 'set' styles, and I found my curls seemed to drop much more quickly when created using the AirStyle versus other auto-wrap curlers I've tested \u2013 even cheap ones like the Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro.\n\nThe second problem is that the tools don't attach securely enough. It's a simple twist mechanism, with no 'click' and no release switch. That's fine for something like the Fast dryer attachment, but with brush tools that require twisting as part of the styling process, I fairly regularly ended up with a dryer in hand and a brush hanging tangled in my hair.\n\nDespite these frustrations, I'm hesitant to give up on Dreame's multistyler just yet. It just has so much promise. When (or if \u2013 nothing is confirmed yet) a new version arrives, I just hope these two problems will have been addressed.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Dyson's new Airwrap is smaller and more powerful, but it's the new straightening attachment that really turned my head\n\u2022 I tested 3 Airwrap dupes, and I'm more convinced than ever that Dyson's styler is the GOAT\n\u2022 Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 review: a budget-friendly robot vacuum that actually does as it's told",

  "summary": "Dreame, a new brand in the home appliances market, has been criticized for its lack of heat and inability to attach its hair styling tools properly. The Dreame AirStyle Pro was the product reviewer's favorite hair styler, offering a range of attachments including auto-wrapping curl barrels, three brushes, and a Flyaway attachment. However, the reviewer found it disappointing due to its inability to get the hair dryer hot enough. The company's website reveals the maximum heat setting for the AirStyle is 122\u00baF / 50\u00baC, compared to the Dyson Airwrap i.d's 194\u00baF - 90\u00baC. Despite these issues, Dreame remains hopeful about a new version of the Airwrap, which may also be more powerful and more versatile.",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Revlon Pro 2-in-1 is a basic brush styler is a little heavy and won\u2019t win any awards for its looks, but on test it was quick and convenient to use, and consistently left me with a salon-worthy, voluminous locks. It lacks the versatility of multi-styler tools, but if you tend to stick to a bouncy blow-dry look, then it's a winner. Oh, and it comes in at a supremely affordable price, too.\nPros\n- +\nSuperb, salon-worthy results\n- +\nLow price; regularly discounted\n- +\nDries and styles hair quickly\nCons\n- -\nA little heavy\n- -\nOnly does one thing\n- -\nHigh-power mode loud\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nRevlon Pro 2-in-1 styler: two-minute review\nThe Revlon Pro Collection One Step Dryer and Volumiser is a brush dryer that disappoints in terms of looks but delivers when it comes to performance. If you want something purely to create a voluminous blow-dry look, this could well be the best hair styler for you.\nThis brush dries your hair, smooths and shapes it all in one go, meaning you don't need a separate hair dryer, and can style one-handed if you want to eat your toast or (for the ambitious) do your makeup at the same time. The oval shape makes it easy to create extra lift at the root, while the large size means you can tackle bigger sections of hair one go.\nIt's rather heavy and not especially well balanced, but it's so efficient that you hopefully won't need to use it for long enough to get arm-ache. For drying, you have a choice of two settings: lower powered and less hot, or higher powered and hotter. The latter is irritatingly noisy, but since the former dried my hair plenty fast enough, I just stuck with that setting.\nWhile there are a few compromises in terms of design, I had absolutely complaints about the results. This styler consistently left my hair bouncy, smooth and voluminous. If you want more versatility, there are plenty of multi-stylers that enable you to create different looks. Be aware, though, adding more options will also bump up the price; this dedicated brush dryer is extremely budget-friendly. Read on for my full Revlon Pro Collection One Step Dryer and Volumiser review.\nRevlon Pro One Step review: price & availability\n- List price: $48.88 / \u00a349.99 (regularly discounted)\nThe Revlon Pro One Step is available at a range of third-party retailers, including the likes of Amazon, Boots in the UK and Walmart in the US. List price seems to vary depending on where you look, but it's typically in the region of $48.88 / \u00a349.99. This brush styler has been out for a while now, and it's rare to see it sold at full price these days.\nThat's great value for what you're getting here. While this tool lacks the versatility of a multi-styler, those can end up being a false economy if you end up just using one or two of the functions. If you just want to create bouncy blow-dry styles, it's a great buy.\nRevlon has now brought out a slightly more premium version called the One-Step Volumizer Plus. This has a different-sized, detachable brush, and 'charcoal-infused nylon pins', but Revlon is not entirely clear on what these are meant to do.\n- Value for money score: 5 out of 5\nRevlon Pro Collection One Step review: design\n- Traditional looking brush dryer with oval-shaped\n- Rotating switch controls temperature and windspeed\n- Rather heavy and not particularly well balanced\nThe Revlon Pro resembles an oversized barrel brush with a chunky handle. At the bottom of this handle \u2013 where it meets the 2.5-meter cord \u2013 is a single switch that you rotate to select a temperature and speed setting. One rotation enables the cold shot function. A second rotation switches to the lower of the two speed settings, while a final rotation switches to the faster of the two. The heat increases between the speed settings, too.\nInstead of having a perfectly rounded barrel, the cylinder is oval, with two slightly flatter, longer sides. This shape helps help lift the hair from the roots and give it more volume.\nIn a market filled with ever-more stylish hair tools, the Pro Collection One Step isn't much to look at. Revlon\u2019s bright pink color scheme feels like an unwelcome throwback to the original models. It\u2019s also heavy at 850g, with the long brush design preventing the weight from feeling evenly distributed.\nThis design choice, however, does make it more compact than a traditional barreled dryer, while saving the hassle of having to take a separate brush when traveling. Plus, its performance soon helps you forget the Revlon Pro\u2019s weight and style shortcomings.\n- Design score: 3.5 out of 5\nRevlon Pro Collection One Step review: performance\n- Dries and styles hair impressively quickly, even on low-power mode\n- High-power mode is annoyingly loud\n- Left my hair smooth, voluminous and shiny\nEven on the lowest of the two speed/temperature settings, the Revlon Pro dried my medium-length fine hair in an impressive three minutes and four seconds. That goes some way to negating its heavy, bulky design \u2013 you won\u2019t need to be using it for long. The large size also means you can dry and style big sections of hair in one go. What\u2019s more, because it styles as it dries, my arms didn\u2019t ache from holding a brush and separate dryer at awkward angles \u2013 as is the case with some of its rivals \u2013 and I didn\u2019t have to do anything to finish my style once it was dry, saving even more time.\nThis latter point is in part due to the Revlon Pro\u2019s ionic technology, and partly because the temperature remains constant throughout. Unlike with traditional dryers, the Revlon Pro is always at the same distance from the head because the hair is wrapped around it; you can\u2019t accidentally place it too close on one section and too far away on another. This means it dries the hair evenly and gently.\nThe ionic technology then smoothes the hair and the rounded design shapes it. Throughout my testing, I was consistently impressed with just how voluminous, shiny and smooth my hair looked after using the Revlon Pro.\nI didn\u2019t see a noticeable difference in drying times on the hotter, faster setting, and would often dry on the slower mode to help prevent causing unnecessary heat damage. The faster setting is also incredibly, annoyingly loud, annoyingly. In terms of decibels, it\u2019s not drastically different to rivals but the tone of the sound is sharp and grating.\nFinally, what I feel is the most significant benefit of the Revlon Pro is the fact you can use it one-handed. When time is tight in the morning, or you just fancy an extra few minutes in bed, you can apply make-up at the same time as drying your hair. Believe me, I do this regularly. If that\u2019s a little too ambitious, you can enjoy a cup of tea or eat toast at the same time. This, for me, is a game-changer.\n- Performance score: 4 out of 5\n- First reviewed: October 2019\nVictoria Woollaston-Webber is a freelance journalist, editor, and founder of science-led health, beauty, and grooming sites, mamabella and MBman.

      "text": "The best Dyson Airwrap dupes 2025: affordable alternatives, tried and tested\nWe tested a range of affordable Airwrap alternatives \u2013 here are the best of the bunch\nToday's best Dyson Airwrap dupes manage to capture some of the magic of Dyson's ultra-popular styler, without the eye-watering price tag. All the options here have been put through their paces by our team of experienced reviewers, and got the stamp of approval. They might not be up there with the original Airwrap, but they're all excellent stylers in their own right.\nThe Dyson Airwrap introduced a new way to curl hair, without the need for the extreme heat of traditional tongs. Rather than a heated wand, the Airwrap has barrels that blast out air in such a way that hair automatically wraps around, and is shaped into coils as it dries. Today's best Airwrap dupes replicate this effect very well. However, we've yet to find one that can manage clockwise and anticlockwise curls on the same barrel attachment, as the real Airwrap can; instead, you'll need to swap between two barrels.\nThe Airwrap also has various attachments that turn it into one of the best multi-styler tools around. Quality and variety of compatible attachments is something else we've considered when pulling together this ranking.\nThe newest version of the Airwrap has switch that launches an automated curl sequence (again, something no dupe offers). Head to our Dyson Airwrap i.d. review to find out how we got on when we tested it. Alternatively, read about its predecessor in our Dyson Airwrap (2022) review, or see how the two compare in our Dyson Airwrap vs Airwrap i.d. explainer.\nIf you're upgrading your styling kit, we also have guides to the best hair dryers and the best hair straighteners. Happy where you are? Read on to discover the best Dyson Airwrap dupes around today.\nThe quick list\nTop pick\nBest overall\nThis is perhaps the closest Airwrap dupe, with a wide range of attachments, including auto-wrap curling barrels. It's on the pricier side, but it's still cheaper than the Airwrap.\nUK pick\nBest affordable \u2013 UK\nIt doesn't feel hugely premium, but this affordable multi-styler does almost everything an Airwrap can, including auto-wrapping your curls.\nUS pick\nBest affordable \u2013 US\nThis styler delivers Airwrap-like features at a manageable price, with six effective attachments, including auto-wrap curl barrels.\nCheap pick\nBest cheap \u2013 UK\nWhile it won't auto-wrap, this styler has a rotating barrel brush that can be used to smooth, volumize and curl your locks, for that professional blow-dry finish.\nWonderful waves\nBest for waves\nWant big curls and waves? This styler comes with four attachments, including a 50mm soft bristle brush that's perfect for just that.\nNatural curls\nFor curly hair\nNot many hot air stylers ship with a diffuser, but this Revamp one does. The various tools can be used to create a wide range of styles.\nThe best Dyson Airwrap dupes 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best Dyson Airwrap dupe\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe closes Dyson Airwrap dupe we've tested is the Shark FlexStyle. It's one of only a few alternatives that use the same auto-wrap Coanda technology that the Airwrap became popular for. Here, the curl barrels function almost identically to the Airwrap's, save for the fact you'll need to swap barrels over to change the direction of curl.\nElsewhere, the FlexStyle boasts a nice wide range of compatible accessories (not quite as wide as Dyson's, but much better than most other brands offer). In some cases you can create your own bundle, so you just choose the attachments you need and aren't lumbered with a load that don't suit your hair needs. On test, we were especially impressed with the paddle brush. It's also the only dupe we've come across to feature a finishing tool \u2013 the 'FrizzFighter', to rival Dyson's FlyAway attachment. We didn't test this so can't vouch for its effectiveness, though.\nThe design is balanced and comfortable to hold, even for extended periods. The top section can be twisted to 90-degrees when using as a hair dryer, enabling you to easily direct the airflow without extending your arms. It also packs a good amount of power, for speedy styling.\nWhile much cheaper than the Airwrap, the FlexStyle is still fairly pricey, and if you're on a budget there are cheaper options at #2 (for the UK) and #3 (for the US) worth considering. However, it's well built and worth the investment if you need the versatility.\nRead more: Shark FlexStyle review\nThe best affordable Dyson Airwrap dupe in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe (deep breath) Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler is our favorite affordable Airwrap dupe in the UK. This tube-shaped multi-styler comes with various styling attachments \u2013 including the all-important auto-wrap curl barrels. Aside from the fact you'll need to swap barrels over when you want to change the direction of curl, these work almost identically to the real Airwrap. A nice touch is the easily accessible Pause button to switch off the blower, so you can remove the wand without disturbing your curls.\nThe Dynamic Radiance Pro can also be used with nothing attached, to rough-dry hair. In this mode it packs a decent amount of power, and the pivoting top section is helpful for directing the airflow without having to extend your arm. The build quality is a little on the cheap side, and our tester found the button placement meant it was a little too easy to accidentally change the settings mid-style, though.\nThere's a decent range of attachments included \u2013 our tester was a big fan of the large oval bristle brush for creating bouncy low-dries \u2013 and they come on and off easily and feel secure in use. However, unlike the Shark (#1) that's it for compatible accessories; you can't pick more specialized add-ons to purchase separately or bundle in.\nOverall, if you're looking for an Airwrap dupe that delivers a lot for a far more affordable price than the original, this Revamp model is a great choice.\nRead our full Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler review\nThe best affordable Dyson Airwrap dupe in the US\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLooking for performance and features that are close to the Dyson Airwrap but at a far lower price? Our top dupe in the US is the Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler is a pretty strong bet. It's one of a handful Airwrap dupes (including the Shark at #1) that uses the Coanda effect to create curls, and it comes with enough power and accessories to make it an effective styler a range of hair types.\nThe design is a little more premium than other dupes in this list, with the rubberized finish making it comfortable to grip. There are three power and three temperature settings plus a cool shot to lock in your style. Alongside your auto-wrap curl barrels, the accessories are mostly limited to different brushes \u2013 unusually, there's no concentrator here, and no diffuser either.\nOur reviewer, who has super-curly type 4c hair, was impressed by the Sharper Image Revel's performance, finding that it it dried her hair quickly without any noticeable heat damage but a little frizz, and did a good job of both straightening and curling. She noted, though, that for best results you'll have to put a lot of practice into using the Revel, and even then you might need to lower your expectations of what you'll get from an all-in-one tool.\nRead our full Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler review\nThe best cheap Dyson Airwrap alternative in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Remington Curl and Straight Confidence Airstyler AS8606 (also known as the Remington Pro Rotating Hot Air Styler AS8606 in the US) is a great Airwrap alternative if you're on a very tight budget. While there's no auto-wrap curl barrels, this styler has a different solution: it can be set to rotate automatically when the barrel brush tool is attached, to mimic the curl and smoothing action that hairdressers make look so easy when blow drying locks.\nThis versatile styler can smooth, volumize and curl, and on test we found it effective at creating both straight and bouncy hair styles. However, it's not the most powerful option here, and with only two temperature settings and two windspeeds, you have less precise control compared to other models in this list (which tend to have three of each). We found the curling tong was a little fiddly to use, requiring some patience and practice. On the downside, this tool is a little bulky, and only comes with one, rather large brush attachment, making it best for use on mid-length and longer hair.\nRead more: Remington Curl and Straight Confidence Airstyler AS8606 review\nThe best Dyson Airwrap dupe for big curls and waves\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BaByliss Air Style 1000 is another UK-only Airwrap alternative that's worth considering if you're on a budget. There are no auto-wrap curl barrels here, but it ships with a selection of four attachments: a drying nozzle, soft round bristle brush, a paddle brush and a conical barrel for soft curls.\nOn test, we found our tester managed to create bouncy results but found the process time-consuming \u2013 especially because the dryer isn't especially powerful. Some of the attachments are a little fiddly, and the fact they heat up in use and lack stay-cool sections means you'll need to keep the heat-resistant glove handy for swapping them over. The soft bristle brush is on the large side, making it best suited to those with long hair.\nThere are some compromises you'll need to make with this styler, but it's affordable enough that it's still a decent buy \u2013 provided you have the patience to achieve good results.\nRead more: BaByliss Air Style 1000 review\nThe best Dyson Airwrap dupe for curly hair\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have naturally curly hair then this Airwrap alternative is worth considering, as it\u2019s one of a handful of options that ships with a diffuser. This attachment disperses the air stream when drying, so it doesn\u2019t disrupt the curl pattern. In total there are six attachments, including different-sized round brushes, and one of the narrowest curling tong attachments we've come across, making it ideal for creating everything from soft bouncy waves to tight curls in all lengths of hair.\nOn test, we found it was able to effectively smooth and wave hair \u2013 although you won't get the auto-wrap curl effect the Airwrap is known for, and which is included on the other Revamp styler here (#2). Our reviewer found the 6-in-1 Ionic Airstyle bulky to hold, and struggled to to clamp hair against the curling tong easily, and the attachments could be tricky to remove, too. However, she was impressed by the hinged filter, which made it easy to clean dust and lint.\nRead more: Revamp Progloss Airstyle 6-in-1Air Styler DR-1250 review\nHow to choose the best Dyson Airwrap dupe for you\nWhen it comes to buying the best Airwrap alternative for you, there are a number of features you should consider.\nFirst of all, decide how much versatility you want from the hot air styler. Do you only ever smooth and straighten your hair, or are you looking for a styler that can also add volume and create soft waves, or even tight curls? Look for models that come bundled with the correct attachments for these different looks.\nIf you regularly curl your hair, you\u2019ll find a hot air styler that has a grip on the tong invaluable as it means you don\u2019t have to hold the tresses while they\u2019re wrapped around the attachment. Similarly, smaller brushes are best suited to those with shorter, to mid-length hair, as if a brush is too wide, you\u2019ll struggle to get a defined wave unless your hair is long.\nThe higher the wattage of Airwrap dupe, the faster the airflow, which means it will dry and style your hair quicker. Also consider the number of temperature settings it offers. If you have fine or colored hair, you\u2019ll need a lower temperature setting to reduce heat damage, whereas coarser hair can withstand higher temperatures.\nAirwrap alternatives with cool shot buttons are ideal for \u2018setting\u2019 hair styles so they don\u2019t drop as quickly, while longer cables enable you to style your hair without having to be positioned right next to an electrical outlet.\nFrequently asked questions about Dyson Airwrap dupes\nHow similar are Dyson Airwrap dupes to the original?\nIn terms of the basics, fairly well. The very best Airwrap dupes feature the auto-wrap curl barrels that the original Airwrap was known for. These use the Coanda effect to wrap hair around the barrel, shaping it into curls as it dries it. The auto-wrap barrels on Airwrap dupes are functionally almost identical to the first Airwrap.\nDyson has moved a step ahead of the competition now, though: you can create clockwise and anticlockwise curls on the same barrel, whereas all dupes require you to swap over your barrel. The newest version, the Airwrap i.d., has a curl switch that runs through a curl plus cool shot cycle, timed specifically to suit your hair, at the flick of a switch. Again, you won't find that on a dupe.\nIn terms of other attachments, quality varies depending on which alternative you go for. In general, expect lower quality and less power than if you invested in an Airwrap, although, there are some very good dupes about these days.\nAre Airwrap dupes damaging to hair?\nAny hair care appliance that uses heat to style will damage the outer protective coating of hair, known as a cuticle. The cuticle is formed of layers of overlapping cells known as scales.\nThese scales line up perfectly on healthy hair and reflect light, which is why hair appears shiny. However, when hair is subject to temperatures that are too hot, tiny holes will start to appear in these cells, which not only stoops the light reflecting, but eventually leads to breakages.\nThe Airwrap alternatives we\u2019ve tested don\u2019t drop as low as 300F / 150C, which is the coolest heat setting offered by Dyson\u2019s iconic hot air styler.\nSubsequently, they will (likely) cause damage to your hair if used untreated. To mitigate this, always apply a heat protection styling spray before blow drying, and keep the heat level at the lowest setting that still enables the hair to be manipulated into the style you want.\nHow we tested these Dyson Airwrap dupes\nTo compare Airwrap dupes we assess how effective they are at smoothing, volumizing and curling our locks on all of their heat settings and how shiny and frizz-free they left our hair.\nWe also monitored the sound level, and factored in how comfortable and balanced they were to use, along with how easy the attachments were to change and any handy features such as rotating barrels, or grips on curling tongs, that make it easier to style your hair.\nWe also considered cable length, any storage options for the attachments, and even cool shot buttons.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "I tested 3 Airwrap dupes, and I'm more convinced than ever that Dyson's styler is the GOAT\nWhen it comes to effortless styling, Dyson has the market wrapped up\nDyson changed the multistyler game when it launched its Airwrap. So much so, that it wasn't long before a wave of copycat stylers began to appear on the market. I loved the newest version of this gadget when I tested it out for my Dyson Airwrap i.d. review, but there's no denying it's silly expensive.\nSo I got my hands on a selection of cheaper alternatives, to see how they matched up and if I could get similar results without clearing out my bank account. Unfortunately, I have bad news for the bargain-hunters.\nWhile today's best Airwrap dupes can now replicate the functionality of the original model from 2018, Dyson has been busy upping its game since then \u2013 the current Airwrap i.d. includes features you just can't find elsewhere, and elevate it head-and-shoulders above the competition. It's hands-down the best hair styler I've used, and if you can afford it, the Airwrap i.d. is worth the investment.\nAirwrap rewind\nBefore I tell you why, let's rewind slightly. What makes an Airwrap so worthy of copying? It's essentially a tube-shaped hair dryer onto which different styling attachments can be clipped.\nThe original launched in 2018, and the reason it garnered so much attention is because it offered a new way to create curls. Rather than use the extreme heat of traditional tongs to style hair, the Airwrap uses something called the Coanda effect to attract and wrap hair around its barrel automatically, shaping it into curls as it finishes drying it.\nAt that time, the alternatives didn't offer Coanda-powered, auto-wrapping curl barrels, and as such struggled to really compete. However, modern stylers \u2013 including the Shark FlexStyle, Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 and Dreame AirStyle Pro (review in progress) I've tested \u2013 do all offer this tech.\nIn fact, they do it pretty well. Functionally, a styling tool such as the FlexStyle works very similarly to the original Airwrap to create curls. So why wouldn't I buy one?\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMay I see some i.d. please?\nThe biggest reason is because Dyson has added two new capabilities to its Airwrap since that original model, and both are game-changers. The first innovation \u2013 introduced in the Airwrap (2022) model \u2013 is the ability to create clockwise and anticlockwise curls on the same barrel, rather than two separate ones, simply by twizzling a knob at the top.\nThe ability to switch direction creates more natural-looking curls with less effort. I'm not aware of any dupes that can do this \u2013 when testing the alternatives, I found myself sticking to one direction of curl on one side of my head, and the other on the other side, just because I couldn't be bothered to switch barrels.\nThe second innovation is i.d. curl, introduced with the 2024 Airwrap i.d. Flick the switch on the front of the styler and it will launch an automated curl sequence: a few seconds of lower-powered air to get the hair in place; a few more seconds of hot air to create the curl; then a cool shot to set the style. The exact timings are based on your specific hair type, set via a short quiz you complete in the companion app.\nOn test, I found that not only did this feature make for a fantastically low-effort styling session, it also meant a big improvement in the results. My curls created using the Airwrap i.d. looked more uniform and lasted far longer than those created using any of the other alternative stylers \u2013 something I attribute entirely to the fact that the routine is personalized to my styling needs and hair type.\nIt's a pain to have to clock-watch or guesstimate timings when creating your curls. The same applies to the cold shot \u2013 I know it's the best way to make Airwrap curls last, but what are the chances of even remembering to cold shot each curl amidst styling a whole head of hair? No chance at all. A very patient and conscientious home-styler with plenty of time on their hands might be able to achieve the Airwrap's results with a cheaper, less automated gadget, but I'm willing to bet most of us don't fall into that camp.\nThe other reason for not wanting to stray from my beloved Airwrap i.d. is that I simply feel it wins out over rival brands for build quality and attention to detail.\nWith the FlexStyle model, for example, I found the texture of the barrels a little too rough, so hair would snag when trying to wrap or release. And on the Revamp model, the location of the buttons makes it all too easy to accidentally change the settings mid-style. While the Dreame gadget I'm currently reviewing looks the part, the attachments don't clip on securely, and can twist off while you're trying to wrangle your locks into place.\nSuch issues might not be deal-breakers on their own \u2013 especially on a low-cost styler \u2013 but here's the thing: some of the rival tools aren't especially low-cost. They're cheaper than the Airwrap i.d., but they're far from budget \u2013 the FlexStyle has a list price of $279.99 / \u00a3269.99 / AU$499.99, while the Dreame Airstyle Pro costs $399.99 / \u00a3299 / AU$599. Not exactly pocket change.\nIn contrast, the Airwrap i.d. is $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$849. That does represent a big price-hike, but if you can get it on a deal, it's well worth the extra investment.\nYou might also like...\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nWith a unique pipe-shaped design, the Dyson Supersonic r is lightweight, powerful, and supremely easy to control and direct \u2013 even in awkward spots such as the back of your head. The controls are a little fiddly, but you might not need to change them that often, because the Supersonic r will remember and revert to your last-used settings with each attachment you snap on. If you spend a long time styling, and want to splash out on a premium dryer, this would make a great choice \u2013 provided the supersized plug will fit in your preferred power outlet, that is.\nPros\n- +\nLightweight and comfortable to use\n- +\nVery easy to direct airflow\n- +\nPowerful\n- +\nRemembers preferred settings\n- +\nWell-designed, useful attachments\n- +\nEasy-to-hold cool switch\nCons\n- -\nSlightly fiddly controls\n- -\nHuge plug that extends downwards\n- -\nControls easy to change accidentally\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDyson Supersonic r: two-minute review\nThe Dyson Supersonic r began life as a professional-only hair dryer, but is now available to the general public. It looks unlike any other hair dryer on the market; there's no barrel to speak of, but instead the handle curves to a right angle, so the whole thing looks like a pipe \u2013 or a lower case \"r\", if you like.\nI tested the model to see how it compares to the rest of the best hair dryers on the market, and overall I was impressed. It's lightweight and comfortable to hold, and the unusual shape makes it super-easy to direct the airflow with precision, even in awkward spots such as the back of your head. As I'd expect from Dyson, it's also impressively powerful, making speedy work of rough-drying hair.\nThe compromise of the design is that in order to achieve the ultra-streamlined shape, Dyson has shifted some of the mechanics into the plug, which in turn is so chunky, it likely won't fit into some sockets. I also found the controls \u2013 which are small and positioned on the back of the handle \u2013 slightly fiddly to use, and a little too easy to accidentally press while styling. It feels like a design that would work just fine for professionals, who have a clear view of the buttons as they hold the dryer in front of themselves; but it's a little awkward for drying your own hair.\nThe magnetic attachments are thoughtfully designed and work well. Sensors enable the dryer to recognize which attachment is snapped on, and automatically adjust to your last-used temperature and airflow settings, which helps streamline the styling process.\nPrice-wise, it will come as a surprise to no one that we're in ultra-premium territory here. While the Supersonic r's build quality is impeccable, and the design innovative, some customers might find themselves more inclined to spend that amount on the Dyson Supersonic Nural, with its hi-tech Scalp Protect mode and ability to auto-pause when it's put down (both of which are absent from the Supersonic r). Most of the Supersonic r's appeal is in that lightweight and streamlined shape, and on that front it really is a standout option, and unique on the market, too.\nThat's the short version; read on for my full Dyson Supersonic r review.\nDyson Supersonic r review: price & availability\n- List price: $569.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$799\n- Launched: April 2025 (consumer version)\n- Available: Worldwide\nThe original version of the Dyson Supersonic r hit the market in February 2024, but it was available to professional hairstylists only. The consumer version reviewed here launched in April 2025.\nAt list price it costs $569.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$799. That's firmly in the premium bracket for hair dryers, and one of the priciest on the market right now \u2013 possibly beaten only by Dyson's other dedicated dryer, the Supersonic Nural, which comes in at $499.99 / \u00a3399.99 / AU$749.\nHowever, the outlay is perhaps a little easier to justify with the latter, because the Nural offers several features not found in other models on the market, whereas the Supersonic r, for the most part, is simply a very efficient hair dryer.\nAs I'd expect from Dyson, build quality is top-notch, and there's plenty of meticulous research and engineering that's gone into the development of this dryer. It looks and feels premium, and as mentioned, it's incredibly well suited to precision styling. Nevertheless, if the outlay is too much, there are plenty of excellent dryers available for a far lower price.\n- Value for money score: 3.5 out of 5\nDyson Supersonic r specs\nWattage: | 1,700W |\nDimensions (L x H x W): | 9.4 x 1.5 x 3.1in / 24 x 3.8 x 8cm |\nWeight: | Confirming |\nAirflow settings: | 3 |\nTemperature settings: | 3 + cool shot |\nExtra modes: | None |\nCord length: | 9.2ft / 2.8m |\nDyson Supersonic r review: design\n- Lightweight, with a unique, ultra-streamlined shape\n- Some mechanics have been shifted into the plug, which is enormous\n- Magnetic attachments with setting memory\nThe Dyson Supersonic r looks nothing like the Supersonic that helped cement Dyson's status in the haircare market. In fact, it doesn't really look like a hairdryer at all \u2013 it looks like a pipe. It's tubular in build, with a top end that curves to a stubby right-angle.\nThe only difference compared to the professional version is that the cable is shorter. It's now 9.2ft / 2.8m, which is still up there with the longest on the consumer market.\nThat diminutive build is made possible by some redesigned mechanics. On the inside you'll find a more streamlined air heater than the one found in the regular Supersonic hair dryers. Ten heater foils follow the curve of the dryer, apparently to offer more consistent temperatures, with no hot or cold spots. That sits alongside a Dyson Hyperdymium motor (unconfirmed whether this is the same / a version of the Hyperdymium motor that powers today's best Dyson vacuums).\nDyson has also redesigned the plug socket, which now \"incorporates primary electronics\" that would otherwise have been inside the dryer itself (it looks very similar to the one included with the Dyson Airstrait.) That shifts extra weight away from your arm, but it does mean the plug is now pretty chunky \u2013 the main part measures 4.8in / 12.2cm (excluding the wrap at the top of the cord), with a part that protrudes downwards from the pins and lies flat to the wall. If you have power outlets that sit close to the floor or above protruding baseboards, it might not fit.\nThere's a removable filter cage, with a flashing yellow LED to tell you when it needs cleaning.\nThe consumer Supersonic r is one of the first Dyson haircare gadgets to introduce the brand's new colorways (currently being rolled out across the full range). Rather than the tropical tones we're used to seeing, it's available in the more delicate Ceramic Pink and Jasper Plum.\nControls\nIn terms of settings, there's a rocker switch to increase and decrease temperature, and another for windspeed. There are three levels for each, indicated by lights. There's also a separate power button. All can be found on the rear of the handle. Round the front, beneath the curve of the dryer, is a cool-shot button.\nAttachments\nIn terms of attachments, there's an impressive selection. Compatible attachments include a Professional Concentrator, Powerful Air Attachment, Gentle Air Attachment, Flyaway Attachment, Smoothing Nozzle, Diffuser and Wide-Tooth Comb. Beware, though, what's included in the box varies by region.\nPersonally, I'm a fan of the way the model is being offered in the UK: just as with the Dyson Airwrap i.d., you can choose between a Curly+Coily Supersonic r and a Straight+Wavy one. Both have a Powerful Air Attachment, Professional Concentrator and Flyaway Attachment, then the one for curls adds a Wide-Tooth Comb and Diffuser, and the other swaps in the Smoothing Nozzle and Gentle Air Attachment. That means you don't end up with a bunch of attachments that aren't suitable for your hair type, gathering dust.\nAs is standard for Dyson haircare products, the add-ons attach via magnets. And like the Supersonic Nural, they contain RFID sensors, which means the Supersonic r knows which one is attached. The recommended settings will kick in as default, and if you change them then the hair dryer will remember your preferences next time you snap that attachment back on.\n- Design score: 4 out of 5\nDyson Supersonic r review: performance\n- Comfortable to hold and incredibly easy easy to direct airflow\n- Controls a little fiddly and can be pressed accidentally\n- Attachment setting memory helps streamline the styling process\nDyson describes the r as being geared towards \"fast, precision drying\", with the unusual design making it easier to reach areas that would otherwise be tricky to tackle \u2013 namely, the back of your head. On test, that absolutely held true. It's comfortable to hold and extremely easy to direct; perfect if you want to be able to dry with precision. My only slight complaint is that I found the handle a touch too short.\nAirflow is nice and powerful, drying my hair quickly; a rough-dry won't take long at all. However, the Supersonic r is really geared towards more complex styling tasks, where its light weight and easy-to-direct airflow come into their own.\nThe Supersonic Nural has a feature where it will automatically drop into low-powered mode if you put it down. That' isn't present here, and I missed it, although I will concede that it's a nice-to-have rather than an essential.\nMoving on to the controls, the design of which I was a little less sold on. The switches to adjust speed and temperature are tiny and a little fiddly to use, and the positioning on the back of the handle means they proved fairly easy to press accidentally. I feel like they're better suited to professional use \u2013 where the person drying the hair can easily see the buttons; they're a little fiddly if you're trying to dry your own hair.\nI was far more impressed with the cool-shot button, which sits on the inside of the handle, where it's comfortable to depress for setting your style.\nAttachment performance\nAll the attachments are well designed and good quality, and the magnetic connection feels secure in use. Usefully, all the attachments have areas that stay cool, so you can comfortably remove them immediately after using if switching to another, for example.\nAttachment memory is a welcome addition. It helps streamline the drying process, and means less fiddling about with controls as you dry. It will prove most useful for people who use multiple attachments throughout their styling routine. I guess it might also help with hair health, if it makes you less likely to default to \"hot and fast\" for everything.\nCurly haired users might miss the two-part Wave+Curl Diffuser, which was introduced with the Supersonic Nural but is absent here \u2013 you're just getting the standard all-in-one option instead.\nA special shout-out should go to the Flyaway Attachment, which uses the Coanda effect (the same thing that makes the Airwrap work) to attract and smooth your locks once you've finished styling. It's unique to Dyson's dryers, and it made a noticeable difference to the sleekness of my hair.\n- Performance score: 4.5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Dyson Supersonic r?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Very much a premium buy, and while the quality is outstanding, the list of special features is relatively short. | 3.5 / 5 |\nDesign | Lightweight with a unique, ultra-streamlined shape and a wide range of well-designed attachments.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Dreame R20 is a robust and efficient cordless stick vacuum that combines excellent power, low weight and expert manoeuvrability with stylish, contemporary design and decent ergonomics. If you're on a budget and are looking for Dyson-challenging performance at less than half the price, this model ticks all the right boxes.\nPros\n- +\nLightweight and manoeuvrable\n- +\nExcellent suction performance\n- +\nGood selection of tools\n- +\nExceptional battery life\n- +\nVery competitive price point\nCons\n- -\nPower trigger is over sensitive\n- -\nSlightly annoying whiney noise in use\n- -\nNo low-power mode\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDreame R20 cordless vacuum: two-minute review\nThe Dreame R20 is a sterling compact, lightweight cordless stick vac that delivers exceptional cleaning performance at a very competitive price. Its exceedingly powerful suction, useful dust detection, superb maneuverability and user-friendly design make it a very strong competitor to expensive premium brands like Dyson and Miele.\nA sub-brand of the massive Xiaomi empire, Dreame (pronounced Dreamy) is fast becoming a lead player in the arena of innovative floor cleaning products. Whether it's stick vacs, robot vacs or wet and dry hard floor cleaners, it seems the Chinese company has a product to suit all pockets and applications.\nAt 2.7 kilos, the R20 also one of the lightest stick vacs currently on the market, and that's not something to be sniffed at. Some of the best cordless vacuums on the market are notoriously heavy in the hand and therefore tiring to use for long periods of time.\nDespite one minor anomaly \u2013 namely the over-sensitive on/off trigger \u2013 the R20 is a joy to use (if vacuuming could every be considered a joy). If you're in the market for a highly accomplished cordless stick vac that costs a fraction of the price of a Dyson and even some Shark models, step right this way. This is one of the very best budget vacuums I've tested. Read on for my full Dreame R20 cordless stick vacuum review.\nDreame R20 review: price & availability\n- List price: $449.99 / \u00a3279\n- Available: UK, US, various other territories (not Australia)\nThose living in the US can head straight to the US Dreame store where it has a list price of $449.99, but is currently selling for just $269.99. Amazon also lists the R20 though it's currently unavailable on its website.\nIf you live in the UK, the list price is \u00a3279, discounted (very slightly!) to \u00a3259 when shopping direct at the UK Dreame store. Alternatively, it's stocked at a range of third party retailers, including Amazon, Currys and B&Q.\nIncidentally, the Dreame website lists 27 countries in all \u2013 including most European territories \u2013 so head there if you have trouble sourcing this product in your country. Although Dreame does have a presence in Australia, the R20 isn't currently available there.\nIn the US and UK, the Dreame R20 sits near the bottom of the mid-range price bracket, and offers excellent value for that price, competing exceedingly well with premium brands like Dyson and Miele in terms of features and performance. In fact, it's become my new favourite vac, beating the excellent Halo Capsule X for size and storability and the Dyson Gen5detect for price and weight. It also ships with a wide range of accessories, including a short bendy suction tube for reaching deep under beds and sofas.\n- Value for money score: 5 out of 5\nDreame R20 cordless vacuum specs\nType: | Cordless stick vacuum |\nBagless: | Yes |\nWeight: | 6 lbs / 2.7kg |\nBin size: | 0.6 litres |\nMax runtime: | 90 mins |\nCharge time: | 2 hours |\nTools: | 2 x floorheads, motorised mini brush head, crevice nozzle, rectangular brush nozzle and bendy suction tube connector |\nPower: | 570W |\nDreame R20 review: design\n- Compact cordless, bagless stick vacuum\n- Light in the hand and very easy to maneuver\n- Overly sensitive power trigger, easily accidentally activated\nAlthough I've only reviewed two Dreame products to date \u2013 this mid-size cordless stick and the excellent Dreame L40 Ultra robot vac and mop \u2013 I have to say that I'm suitably impressed by what I've seen so far, at least when compared to some of the competition.\nThis model arrived in a larger box than the norm but that's only because it ships with a multitude of attachments, including two main floorheads for hard floor and carpet, a mini motorized head for upholstery and carpeted staircases, a ridiculously lightweight carbon fibre suction tube, a short Shark-like articulating suction tube that bends forwards 90 degrees for reaching under beds and sofas, plus the obligatory crevice tool with pull-down brush for cleaning hard-to-reach areas and along skirting boards and, to top it all off, a rectangular dusting brush for shelves and around the fireplace.\nIt also came with a Dyson-style wall-mounted charger that is thankfully far less fiddly to fit, and a power plug that looks identical to those provided by Dyson. A lot of Dyson-esque stuff, in other words. (See how it compares to those brands' top offerings in TechRadar's guides to the best Shark vacuums and the best Dyson vacuums.)\nThe Dreame R20 weighs in at 6 lbs / 2.7kg \u2013 almost a kilo lighter than my (admittedly very weighty) Dyson Gen5detect, and 26g lighter than the comparable Dyson V15 Detect. I put much of this lower weight down to the R20's featherweight carbon fibre suction tube (a paltry 205g against the Dyson Gen5's 387g) and the smaller size of its handheld motor and bin housing.\nBelieve me, you'll come to appreciate this model's lower weight when it comes to a full clean of the home; it not only makes the R20 easy to push but also just as easy to carry from room to room, and especially up a flight of stairs.\nThe Dreame R20 wins no awards for unique design innovation since it adopts the same motor housing and bin configuration as the vast majority of other manufacturers, Dyson notwithstanding. Nevertheless, the hand unit feels comfortable enough to hold when being used, though the jury's out on the position and sensitively of the on/off trigger. It's not a major bind but I found that my index finger inadvertently set it off when carrying it from one part of a room to another.\nI'm also not too enamored with the flat finger guard below the trigger, which feels a bit uncomfortable at times. There is, thankfully, a little button on the rear of the housing that engages the motor for continual running but even this handy feature is spoiled by the fact that you need to hover the index finger above the trigger or you might mistakenly turn it off again. In truth I'd prefer to have seen a system like that used on some of Dyson's most recent products where there's a single on/off button on the rear and no trigger whatsoever.\nWhile we're discussing the hand unit, I should also mention the cute little elliptically-shaped LCD interface on the back. This provides battery information in percentage terms and a pretty butterfly icon that indicates which suction mode is in use.\nThere are two main modes \u2013 Standard (which lights up green) and Boost (which shows up blue/white). You can switch between the two manually by simply tapping a small button just below the rear interface. However, the vacuum also contains sensors that mean it'll automatically ramp up from Standard to Boost mode if there's a lot of dust about. This works really well \u2013 I used the vacuum to sweep my fire log shelf and it switched in and out of Boost on a regular basis. There's also a supercharged mode for when the sensor detects a really filthy section (the butterfly icon turns red for this).\nMost modern stick vacuums will have a low-powered mode to extend the battery life when dealing with light cleaning tasks, but that's missing here. However, runtimes are still exceptional (more on this in the Battery section).\nBefore we look at the floorhead setup, let's take a tour of the R20's bagless dust bin. The bin itself has a 0.6-litre capacity which is about 0.2-liters less than much of the competition. This means the bin will fill faster and perhaps require an extra trip to the dustbin to empty it, especially if you have a household of shedding pets. It also means that this model may not be suitable for a larger house, unless you have one on every floor.\nLike a lot of stick vacs, the R20's bin-emptying system is a basic affair comprising a simple latch that opens the bottom flap to eject the debris. When it's full of general detritus like dust, crumbs and the like, this system works perfectly well. But when it's full of mostly pet hair you will almost certainly need to reach into the canister with your fingers or tweezers to extricate the clumps.\nThis isn't a slight on the product, mind, because it's the method used by the vast majority of vacuum manufacturers \u2013 an exception being Dyson. Besides, pet hair is one of the most obstreperous forms of debris found in the home and the nemesis of most vacuum cleaners.\nOne of the R20's standout features is its exceptional suction power. Equipped with a 190 Air Watt motor, it effortlessly tackles dust, debris, pet hair and even larger particles like puffer rice cereal and biscuit crumbs on both hard floors and carpets. However, the motor does produce an annoying high-pitched whine in both power settings.\nIt's not the worst I've ever heard and you'll soon get used to it, but it's also a bit of an irritant when vacuuming with someone else in the room. Dreame lists it at 85dB but I measured a more reasonable 75.4dB in Boost mode at head height.\nIn terms of filtration, the blurb says the R20 has a five-stage filtration system that supposedly deals with 99.9% of particles. All I can say is that it does indeed seem to effectively trap dust and allergens, ensuring cleaner air in the home. Cleaning the filter is a doddle and simply involves pressing a latch and removing the main cyclone housing, which you then rinse under a tap along with its small circular cloth filter. Just be sure that both parts are thoroughly dry before refitting, or you'll end up with a vacuum cleaner that smells.\nOkay, let's get down to floor level and the business end of this model. The Dreame R20 ships with two main floorheads: a motorised 22.5cm roller fitted with hard plastic ribs and two curvy bristle brushes that's been designed for carpet use; and a 21.5cm bristle-coated head for hard floors. The ribbed head can also be used on hard floors if you can't be bothered to keep swapping heads, but the hard floor-specific roller is more efficient on wooden and tile flooring, and it'll buffs up the flooring in the process (we rate the R20 as one of the best vacuums for hardwood floors). Both heads swivel at a near 90-degree angle for Dyson-like manoeuvrability.\nLike many modern stick vacs, this model's carpet floorhead is also fitted with two bright blue LEDs that project onto the floor, illuminating hidden dust and debris that might otherwise go unnoticed. No, it's not as effective as Dyson's innovative laser light system but it's arguably better than much of the remaining competition.\nOverall construction of the R20 seems very good, and the smooth shiny plastics used appear to be very robust, too. I especially like the look and feel of the carbon fibre suction tube, which adds a touch of class while dramatically reducing the weight of the whole package. However, I'm not sure the carbon tube would survive the weight of a misjudged foot were the unit lying on the floor \u2013 let's just say that it has a little more flex in it than I would expect from carbon fibre. At least I'm presuming it's authentic carbon fibre, given that it's mentioned on the Dreame website.\n- Design score: 4.5 out of 5\nDreame R20 review: performance\n- Excellent suction performance on hard floor and carpet\n- Superb manoeuvrability\n- Light in weight\nOn test, the Dreame R20 delivered exceptional suction power for its compact size and I've been extremely impressed by its floorheads' ability to steer around chair legs and swivel at almost 90 so they can reach into the tightest of spaces. Top marks in this respect.\nHowever, the high suction combined with the design of the main carpet-specific floorhead means that it's difficult to push the R20 on medium- and deep-pile carpet. I really needed to put my shoulder into it \u2013 a bit of a workout, in other words. But wait, I lie, because I subsequently found a small, almost invisible sliding air intake that improved carpet resistance immeasurably without affecting the R20's cleaning power. Just wish Dreame hadn't disguised it so well.\nThis model generally feels remarkably light in use and it's amazingly manoeuvrable \u2013 as easy to steer as any Dyson I've tested, I'd say. The flexible hose attachment further enhances its versatility, allowing for convenient cleaning under furniture and beds.\nFor my tests I stuck to the usual TechRadar remit and scattered a mixture of oats, flour and crushed digestives on both my wooden kitchen floor and medium-pile rug. I also scattered some Coco Pops for good measure (no, I haven't grown up yet).\nI was frankly blown away by the R20's performance in the hard floor test because, as soon as its 'intelligent dirt detection' system kicked in, the motor ramped up to Boost and everything disappeared up the tube and into the bin, leaving a clear path with zero evidence of any flour remaining in the wooden floor's grooves. Yes, it scattered a couple of pieces of rice cereal up against the skirting board, but I simply aimed the front end at them and they were easily snatched by the fast revolving bristle head. Top marks again.\nI then performed the same task on my pet hair-strewn medium pile carpet rug and it sailed through the test collecting almost every last scrap in a single pass. Again, it flung some large biscuit crumbs and a few Coco Pops to the fore but these were easily collected with a second pass.\nI was also amazed at the huge volume of dog and cat hair it collected at the same time with no evidence of tangles on the floorhead. And that just goes to prove that this model handles pet hair with aplomb \u2013 I'd rate it amongst the best vacuum cleaners for pet hair. However, you may need to visit the kitchen dust bin more often because, as mentioned above, the R20's 0.6-litre dust container is a bit smaller than many of its competitors.\nI had zero issues using the controls other than accidentally pressing the trigger when carrying it. In fact, I found this one to be one of the easiest interfaces I've used. I also liked the way the digital display provided real-time feedback on both battery life and colourful info relating to its intelligent dirt detection.\nI also gave it a whizz in handheld mode, using the long suction tube and rectangular detail brush to sweep the shelves, and it didn't feel too heavy in the hand. I also gave the mini motorized upholstery attachment a whirl on the dogs' bed; it worked a treat though I did need to apply some vigorous back and forth movements.\nMy final thoughts? As close to full marks as you can get, especially given the generally low asking price. Yes, I might suggest a model with a larger bin if being used in a three story house but for everyone else, the Dreame R20 will suffice just fine.\n- Performance score: 4.5 out of 5\nDreame R20 review: battery life\n- Maximum runtime is 90 minutes (well above average)\n- Expect shorter runtimes if the floor is dirty\n- Recharge is also fast, at around 2 hours\nAccording to the manufacturer, the R20\u2019s maximum running time is a well-above-average 90 minutes. I suspect this figure applies more to laboratory conditions than the real world, but it's still incredibly impressive. To put that in context, most cordless stick vacuums offer 40 minutes to an hour, and prior to testing this model, the longest maximum battery life I'd seen was offered by the far more expensive Dyson Gen5detect, with up to 70 minutes.\nIn my hard floor test I managed to eke 84 minutes out of the battery in standard mode with no automatic boost kicking in (I started by vacuuming, then propped the vacuum up with suction lock on, and timed how long the R20 lasted before running out of juice).\nIf used to clean for the whole time, I suspect the runtime would be closer 75 minutes if used on a dusty hard floor and quite a lot less (between 45 and 60 minutes) when used on medium-pile carpet, which adds much more friction to the roller brushes. To be honest, I don\u2019t know anyone capable of vacuuming for more than 40 minutes in any one session without an arm falling off, so these figures are more than sufficient in my opinion. Since the battery is removable, you could also purchase a spare to swap in, if you need even longer than that.\nAt this juncture I should also point out that the juice-hungry Boost mode is almost too powerful for use in any scenario other than cleaning hard-to-reach areas of the car because the battery percentage drops by almost one percentage point every five seconds or so. And that means Boost mode won\u2019t get you much more than about seven minutes of use out of it. (It's not unusual for a vacuum's maximum suction mode to bleed the battery very quickly.)\n- Battery life score: 5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Dreame R20?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Lower mid-range, and exceptional value given the overall performance, features and ease of use. | 5/5 |\nDesign | Generally well designed with ergonomic hand unit and ultra-light suction tube. | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | Whether you're tackling pet hair, everyday messes or deep-cleaning session, the R20 is up to the task. | 4.5/5 |\nBattery | Up to 90 minutes \u2013 well above average, and with fast recharge too. | 5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want to be able to clean for a long time\nThe R20 offers up to 90 minutes of cleaning on a single charge, which is the longest battery life we've found anywhere and long cleaning sessions. Recharge times are fast, too.\nYou have a lot of pet hair\nIn my tests, the R20 effortlessly tackled the large volumes of pet hair from my dogs.\nYou want something light\nClocking in at 6 lbs / 2.7kg, this vac is lighter than much of the competition, and won't tire you out when using it for long periods.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou're dealing with large volumes of dirt\nThis model has a relatively small dust cup, which means those with larger homes might find themselves having to empty it more often than they'd like.\nYou want an easy-empty option\nThis vac has the same empty mechanism you'll find on the vast majority of vacuums \u2013 i.e. one that requires a little bit of manual help, especially when filled with pet hair. The system on most Dyson vacuums (V10 and newer) is more efficient, or if you don't want to be bothered with it at all, Shark's newest flagship models \u2013 the PowerDetect Cordless and Detect Pro Cordless \u2013 have a compatible dock with a large dustbin, that not only charges the vacuum but also empties the small onboard bin.\nDreame R20: alternatives to consider\nProduct: | Dreame R20 (reviewed) | Dyson V15 Detect | Shark PowerDetect Cordless |\n|---|---|---|---|\nWeight: | 6 lbs / 2.7kg | 6.8 lbs / 3kg | 8lbs / 3.7kg |\nBin volume: | 0.6L | 0.8L | 0.7L |\nMax runtime: | 90 mins | 60 mins | 70 mins |\nAccessories: | 2 x floorheads, motorized mini brush head, crevice nozzle, rectangular brush nozzle and bendy suction tube connector | 2 x floorheads, Hair screw tool, Combination tool, Crevice tool | Duster crevice tool, Pet multi-tool, multi-surface tool (UK only), optional auto-empty dock (costs extra) |\nDyson V15 Detect\nThe V15 Detect is a step up in quality and features, but also a big step up in price. For that extra outlay you get more advanced detection capabilities \u2013 this vacuum knows exactly the size and number of particles it's sucking up, and reports back in real time on its snazzy color screen. The soft floorhead has bright lasers to illuminate dirt that might otherwise be missed.\nRead our full Dyson V15 Detect review\nShark PowerDetect Cordless\nThe PowerDetect is heavier and less maneuverable than the R20, but might be worth considering if you're dealing with lots of dirt or pet hair because there's the option of adding an auto-empty base, which sucks everything out of the small vacuum dust cup when you dock it. It's a big effort saver, and good news for those with allergies too.\nRead our full Shark PowerDetect Cordless review\nHow I tested the Dreame R20 cordless vacuum\nTechRadar adopts a strict testing regime for all its products so potential buyers know exactly what they're getting. As usual I stuck to the remit and lived with the machine for a couple of weeks before putting it through some rigorous carpet and hard floor tests using a variety of obstreperous ingredients, including flour and raw oats. I also considered the unit's ergonomics, overall design and experience of using it before alighting on my final verdict.\nRead more about how we test vacuum cleaners\n- First reviewed January 2025\nDerek Adams has been in consumer tech journalism since joining London listings magazine Time Out in the early \u201880s.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Dyson Airwrap i.d. looks a lot like the previous version, but has a new automated curl sequence button that's a total game-changer. It takes all the effort and guesswork out of creating curls and, as a result, styles tends to last longer. It's effective as a dryer, too, and the wide range of compatible attachments mean it can work for different hair types, lengths and styling needs. But the main reason to invest (and it's a big investment) is that curl function \u2013 there's just nothing else like it on the market.\nPros\n- +\nEffortless curl creation\n- +\nLonger-lasting results\n- +\nLots of compatible attachments\n- +\nDoubles as a hair dryer\n- +\nLeft and right curls on same barrel\n- +\nExcellent build quality\nCons\n- -\nPremium pricing\n- -\nCurls don't last as long as with tongs\n- -\nResults will vary by hair type\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDyson Airwrap i.d: two-minute review\nThe Dyson Airwrap i.d. is the latest generation of the brand's ultra-popular multi-styler. Released in 2024, the i.d. introduces one significant upgrade on the original Airwrap: an i.d.curl switch that launches a curling sequence (wrap, curl, cool shot). This simple upgrade is an absolute game-changer \u2013 curling with the Airwrap i.d. feels effortless compared to other auto-wrap stylers I've tested, and the results hold far better, too. It's predictably expensive, but I truly think this is the best hair styler on the market right now.\nIn terms of design, it's the same tube-shaped dryer, onto which various styling tools can be attached. The main ones are the Airwrap barrels, which use the Coanda effect to attract hair, shaping it into a curl as it dries it, without the need for the extreme heat of traditional curling tongs. These are the ones that work with the i.d. curl feature \u2013 and to double-down on what I've said above, the whole thing is now extremely straightforward to use.\nYou don't need to mess around with finding the cool-shot button mid-curl, or take a guess over how long each bit of hair has been wrapped; you just flip the switch, drape a bit of hair over the wand, wiggle it about a bit, and the i.d. will do the rest for you. The timings of the curl sequence are based on information you supply in a companion app (another new development) about your hair type and styling aims. And while nothing has changed with regards to how the Coanda function works, I found my curls remained in place for far longer than they have done using other auto-wrap multi-stylers, purely because the process is automated for you here.\nWith the i.d., Dyson introduced a new tapering barrel alongside the parallel ones of previous models. As before, changing the direction of curl is as simple as twisting the knob at the top of the barrel \u2013 something even today's best Airwrap dupes don't yet offer.\nThe auto-wrap curlers are the main reason to buy an Airwrap, but for styling enthusiasts this styling tool comes with a plethora of compatible add-ons. There are enough drying attachments that mean it can rival today's best hair dryers, too, along with brushes for smoothing or volumizing hair. The variety of attachments on offer also open up the Airwrap to different hair types and lengths \u2013 there's a wide-tooth comb for coils, for instance. However, in terms of effectiveness, I can only really speak to my own experience (I have armpit-length, wavy hair).\nPrice-wise, the Airdrop i.d. is firmly a premium buy; in terms of design, usability and build quality, though, I can't fault it. If you're enthusiastic about styling, like to curl your hair often, and care about long-term hair health, the i.d. is worth the investment. That's the short version; read on for my full Airwrap i.d. review.\nDyson Airwrap i.d. review: price & availability\n- List price: $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$849\n- Launched: August 2024\nDyson products almost always sit in the premium end of the market, and the Airwrap i.d. is no exception. From Dyson direct, it has a list price of $599.99 in the US, \u00a3479.99 in the UK, and AU$849 in Australia. At time of writing, in the US and UK, you can choose between a \"Straight+ Wavy\" or \"Curly+Coily\" bundle, which comprise different attachments, but the pricing for both remains the same. In Australia, it's just the one standard bundle right now.\nThe Airwrap i.d. first launched in August 2024, a newer version of the Airwrap (read our Dyson Airwrap (2022) review for more on that model), which Dyson appears to be phasing out.\nThe i.d. certainly isn't cheap, and of course you're paying a bit of a premium for the Dyson name. However, there's nothing else quite like it on the market right now, and I can fault it for either build quality or attention to detail when it comes to the design.\nYou can pick up cheaper dupes, a few of which even arrive with feature auto-wrapping barrels. Of these, the Shark FlexStyle is perhaps the best regarded, and costs $279.99 / \u00a3269.99 / AU$499.99. In the US, you also have the Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler at $269.99, while in the UK there's the Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler at \u00a3179.99. The Airwrap i.d. is a clear step above all of these models for build quality and features, however \u2013 none can do clockwise and anti-clockwise curls on the same barrel, and none have an automated curl sequence.\nDyson isn't especially known for its discounts, but they do crop up from time to time, and are well worth taking advantage of if you do spot one.\n- Value for money score: 3.5 out of 5\nDyson Airwrap i.d. specs\nWattage: | 1,300W |\nTemperature settings: | 2 + cool shot |\nSpeed settings: | 3 |\nCord: | 2.7m / 8.5 ft |\nSize w/ no attachments (L x W): | 10.7 x 1.9in / 27.2 x 4.8cm |\nWeight w/ no attachments: | 1.4lbs / 0.6kg |\nAirflow: | 13.5 l/s |\nDyson Airwrap i.d review: design\n- Tube-shaped dryer onto which styling accessories attach\n- Auto-curl sequence button and companion app\n- Extensive range of compatible attachments\nThe Airwrap i.d. is a tube-shaped hair dryer onto which various styling accessories can be attached. Primary among these are the Airwrap barrels, which use the Coanda effect to attract hair so it automatically wraps around the barrel and is shaped into curls as it dries. The attachments twist into place easily, and there's a lock switch on the rear of the dryer to release them when you want to swap in another one. I'll get more into the attachments themselves below.\nOn the dryer itself are three sliding buttons to control the settings. There are cleverly positioned near the top of the barrel, out of the way of your grip, but they're easily accessible during styling. Since they're sliding rather than press buttons, you have much less chance of accidentally changing settings as you hold the barrel, too.\nTwo operate temperature (two heat options plus a cool shot) and windspeed (three options), but the third is probably the most interesting. This switches on the blower, but also operates the i.d. curl sequence, where there Airwrap will cycle through the settings required to create the perfect curl.\nThis function is new with the i.d., and works in conjunction with a companion app (see all the differences between the old and new models in my (Airwrap vs Airwrap i.d. comparison). Here, you complete a quiz about your hair type, length and styling goals, and the Airwrap will set its curl sequence settings based the information you've supplied.\nOn initial completion of the quiz, the Airwrap i.d. will remember your sequence, so you don't need your phone connected or with you to use the i.d. curl sequence. However, if you do have the app open, you can also see the progress of the sequence via a countdown graphic.\nAt the base of the dryer is a grille, behind which sits the filter. You can remove the grille to keep the filter clean \u2013 Dyson recommends doing this regularly to keep the i.d. working as efficiently as possible.\nAttachments\nThe Airwrap i.d. has an extensive range of compatible attachments; in fact, more extensive than any other multi-styler I've come across. Don't expect to get all of these with your styler \u2013 different attachments will be included with different bundles, and some are only available to purchase individually via Dyson's accessory store.\nThe ones that the Airwrap first gained popularity for are the Airwrap barrels. These are curling barrels, but instead of heating up, they blast out directed air in such a way that the hair automatically wraps around them, shaping the hair into curls as the styler dries it. Dyson is the only brand (so far) that enables you to create clockwise and anti-clockwise curls using the same barrel. To switch direction, you twist the cool-touch knob at the top of the barrel.\nThe standard barrel is the same width all the way down, but with the i.d. Dyson has added a tapering barrel that creates curls that are tighter at the top and looser at the bottom.\nMy review model was supplied with a couple of attachments geared towards use of the Airwrap as a hair dryer: the Fast dryer and Dryer+Flyaway smoother. One of the new dryer attachments introduced with the i.d. is the Blade Concentrator, but I didn't test this \u2013 and, as far as I can determine, it isn't included in any bundles right now. Bundles geared towards curly or coily hair will include a diffuser and wide-tooth comb.\nThere are various brush attachments in the range, some soft and some firm, and some for smoothing and some for volumizing, and in different sizes to suit different hair lengths. (I got a soft smoothing brush and large round volumizing brush included.)\nMy review model came with a storage / presentation box, but I'm not sure if this is included with every bundle, so check before you buy.\n- Design score: 5 out of 5\nDyson Airwrap i.d. review: performance\n- Comfortable and efficient to use as a dryer\n- i.d. curl sequence is effortless and delivers long-lasting results\n- Volumizing and smoothing brushes also work very well\nAs a dryer, the Airwrap i.d. works very well. It feels lightweight, well balanced, and it's comfortable to hold and easy to wield.\nThe Fast dryer attachment shifts the flow of air so it's at a right angle to the dryer, rather than shooting straight upwards. This means you can hold your arm in a natural and comfortable position. Some Airwrap-alikes have top sections that pivot to a right angle, for the same purpose. Dyson's attachment is more effective because it also widens the flow of air, and results in a noticeable boost in power.\nOn test, I found the Airwrap plus Fast dryer combo dried by armpit-length hair efficiently. It wasn't quite as speedy as a dedicated hair dryer such as the Dyson Supersonic Nural, but it's more powerful than other multi-stylers I've tested. (I've compared the Dyson Supersonic Nural vs Dyson Airwrap, if you're not sure which one you need.)\nCurling\nBefore testing the Airwrap i.d., I thought the curl sequence might be a bit of a gimmick, but I've done a 180 on that view \u2013 I love it. It makes a massive difference to both the effort required to create curls and their staying power once you've finished styling.\nLet's back up a bit. Setting up the i.d. curl sequence in the app is straightforward. You connect your Airwrap via Bluetooth by switching it on and holding it near your phone, then take a short quiz, which incorporates questions about your hair type, length, experience level and hair goals. Based on this information, the app will create your curl sequence settings.\nThis sequence includes wrapping, curling, and then a cool shot, timed to suit your hair type and needs. If you say you're a beginner, for example, you'll have longer to wrap your hair; if your curls tend to drop quickly, you'll get a longer cool shot. Note, though, that you can manually adjust the timings in the app at any time, if you find they don't suit you.\nTo launch the sequence, you flick the central button upwards, and then just get on with curling. If you're not used to this kind of curling, it will take some getting used to, but once you have it down it's easy. (I was shown how to use this by a Dyson-representative hairdresser, as shown in the photos here, but I also tested it out at home, and managed it just fine on my own.)\nThe i.d. curl switch takes the guesswork and fiddling about out of the equation. I've tested a few of these auto-wrap curlers now and there are two areas they prove most annoying. First, guesstimating the time you've been curling a particular section of hair \u2013 it takes longer than traditional tongs, in the region of 8-10 seconds per section \u2013 and second, locating and running the cool shot on each curl. The i.d. takes care of both.\nIn terms of results, I was super impressed. However, I'll state upfront that curls created in this way generally tend to fall out far sooner than those created with traditional hot tongs (you'll need to decide if the benefits to hair health and less heat damage is worth it to you).\nNevertheless, my curls created with the i.d. lasted far longer than those created with competitor stylers. I think this is all down to the automation features: each section of hair is curled for the same length of time; I'm not forgetting or cutting short any cool shots.\nSmoothing and volumizing\nI also tested out the volumizing and smoothing brushes that came bundled with my Airwrap i.d. Both have been deigned well and I had no complaints about how they worked in use. They clip on easily and feel secure in use, and each has a stay-cool section that you can grip hold of for removal. While in terms of functionality there isn't anything particularly unique here, they work well and help boost the versatility of the multi-styler for those times you don't want a curly look.\n- Performance score: 4.5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Dyson Airwrap i.d.?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Very expensive, but a clear step above alternatives in terms of both quality and features. | 3.5 / 5 |\nDesign | Comfortable to hold and use, thoughtfully designed, and the range of compatible accessories is extensive. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Results will vary by hair type, but the i.d. curl made creating curls effortless on my long, wavy hair. The results lasted very well, too, although not as long as traditional hot tongs. Also effective as a hair dryer. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou curl regularly\nWhere the Airdrop i.d. shines is for creating curls. The i.d. curl sequence makes the process effortless, with the results more likely to outlast those where you're relying on guessing timings yourself.\nYou care about hair health\nThis type of curling is far better for your long-term hair health over regularly frying your locks with a curling wand.\nYou're a styling enthusiast\nThe Airwrap i.d. isn't cheap, but the quality of the tool and swappable accompanying attachments come into their own for those who love to create different styles. Of all the multi-stylers, the Airwrap probably features the widest range of compatible accessories.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou don't often curl your hair\nIf you don't regularly curl your hair, there's much less of a performance gap between this and the many Airwrap dupes and multi-stylers on the market. If you're only creating blowout styles, for instance, you could save a lot of money by going for a dedicated brush dryer.\nYou're on a budget\nThere are dupes that will do a very similar job, albeit with lower build quality and more effort required from you.\nHow I tested the Dyson Airwrap i.d.\nBefore receiving my review model, I first got a demo of the Airwrap i.d. from a Dyson representative in a salon. I then used the styler over a few weeks at home, testing out the curling system extensively, and using the other attachments too. I compared my experience to other alternatives I've tested, in terms of quality, usability, and how long the styles lasted.\nRead more about how we test\n- First reviewed March 2025\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nFor top-notch edge cleaning, a mostly hands-free experience and thoughtful features that lead to a deeper clean, look no further than the Dreame X50. It's sleek, smart and stylish, but prepare for slightly stunted battery life and occasionally spotty object detection.\nPros\n- +\nFast-learning\n- +\nThorough AI cleaning\n- +\nCan clear 2.4in / 6cm thresholds\n- +\nPuck recedes to get under furniture\n- +\nRigorous edge cleaning\n- +\nHot water mop pad cleaning\nCons\n- -\nSpotty object avoidance\n- -\nFailed to detect (fake) pet poop\n- -\nBattery drains quickly\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDreame X50 Ultra Complete: two-minute review\nDreame\u2019s latest robot vacuum, the X50 Ultra Complete, sets a new standard for the best robot vacuums, offering a litany of genuinely useful features and excellent cleaning results. It\u2019s low-maintenance, thorough and features all of the bolts and whistles you\u2019d expect from a premium robot vacuum.\nWhile its 2.4in / 6cm threshold-hopping legs have been the main talking point, it's this robot's cleaning performance that prompted me to award it such a high score. It's highly capable at both mopping and vacuuming, though its battery life does leave something to be desired. Plus, its DToF sensor tower can quickly sink into the main body of the vacuum when it needs to clean beneath low-threshold furnishings.\nFrom its extending side brush and mop pads to its excellent mapping, the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete makes full use of its arsenal of cleaning tools, rounded out by efficient 20,000Pa suction. This powerful robovac only really struggles when faced with fine powders on high-pile or tightly bound low-pile carpets; a fairly common issue for vacuums of all shapes and sizes.\nWhen it comes to object detection and avoidance, the X50 Ultra performed fairly well, although it missed crumpled up paper and shorter wires on occasion. It also failed to spot (fake) pet poop during one test \u2013 turning on Pet mode helped improve matters.\nIf you can stretch your budget to buy the X50, you won\u2019t be disappointed in its value proposition. It\u2019s fantastically low-maintenance, the app is easy to use and the results speak for themselves. That's the short version; read on for my full Dreame X50 Ultra Complete review.\nDreame X50 Ultra Complete: price & availability\n- Announced January 2025, on sale from spring 2025\n- List price: $1,699.99 / \u00a31,299 / AU$2,999\nAt its $1,699.99 / \u00a31,299.00 / AU$2,999.00 list price, the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete is one of the most expensive robot vacuums you can buy today. It's available to buy directly from Dreame, as well as via third-party retailers such as Amazon.\nThankfully, Dreame isn\u2019t afraid of a good deal, and in the months since its release I've seen the price drop by $340 / \u00a3150 / AU$200. At its list price, it\u2019s toeing the line of being overpriced, but its early deals make for a strong value proposition. It's fairly common for flagship bots to cost well into the four figures these days, and the features here are in line with (or exceed) what you'd get elsewhere for a similar price.\nPlus, Dreame is generous with accessories. Out of the box, you not only get the vacuum and base (which are pre-loaded with a dust bag, filters, a side brush and brush rolls), but you also get a full bottle of Dreame\u2019s Multi-surface floor cleaner, two pre-loaded mop pads and ten replacement pads, two spare side brushes, two spare roller brushes, three spare filters and a cleaning brush for the water tanks, making for low maintenance costs in the first year or so.\n- Value for money score: 4 out of 5\nDreame X50 Ultra Complete specs\nMax suction: | 20,000Pa |\nRobot diameter: | 13.8in / 35cm |\nRobot height: | 3.5in / 8.9cm (with puck retracted) |\nDock dimensions (W x D x H): | 13.4 x 10.2 x 23.2 in / 34 x 26 x 59cm (excluding ramp) |\nMax threshold clearance: | 2.4 in / 6cm |\nOnboard dustbin volume: | 300ml |\nOnboard water tank capacity: | 80ml |\nDock dust bag volume: | 3.2L |\nDock water tank capacity: | 4.5L clean / 4L dirty |\nBase type: | Charge, self-empty, refill water, wash mop pads, clean and dry mop pads, dispense detergent, self-clean |\nDreame X50 Ultra Complete: design\n- Robot's navigation puck can retract to enter low spaces\n- Underneath are tiny legs to hoist the bot over tall thresholds\n- Comprehensive dock with heated mop cleaning and UV light treatment\nLooks-wise, the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete doesn\u2019t break any conventions. Both the vacuum and its dock are fairly neutral, clad in either white or black with gold or gunmetal accents.\nThe base is slim at 13.4 x 10.2 x 23.2 in / 34 x 26 x 59cm \u2013 although you'll need to add space for the ramp and maneuvering room for the robot to dock. Lift up its lid and you\u2019ll find both the fresh and waste water tanks, while the dust bag and detergent tank are behind the accent panel on the front of the base. It\u2019s also compatible with the Dreame Water Hookup Kit if you wanted a fully automated water refill and drainage system, which is a nice added benefit; I didn\u2019t test this for my review, but broadly speaking, these hookup systems are fairly reliable.\nBehind the scenes, there\u2019s a lot more going on in the base; it's self-emptying and refilling, but also packs cleaning tech for both the dust bin and mop pads, offering heated water mop wetting and hot air drying as well as UV light treatment for bacteria removal.\nThe robot itself similarly manages to pack ample features and functionality into its relatively compact body. It benefits from the direct time of flight (DToF) sensors situated within the sensor tower for accurate navigation and mapping. This can sink into the robovac in order to reach beneath low-clearance furniture, where it relies on its front-facing camera for navigation and obstacle detection instead. You can remove the lid of the robot vacuum to access the dust bin and set up QR code.\nThe underside is where the action happens. Here is where you\u2019ll find its array of cleaning tools. Let\u2019s get the bad news out of the way; while the extending side-arm is fantastic for edge cleaning, my robovac nemesis as a long-haired person are bristled side-arms. Hair is easily tangled, but I\u2019ve yet to test a robovac where I don\u2019t face this problem. Thankfully, the dual brush rollers (Dreame calls these the Hypersteam Detangling Duobrush) are super effective, making light work of pet and human hair alike.\nYou\u2019ll also find the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete\u2019s golden goose amidst the cleaning tools: two stumpy 'legs' that allow the vacuum to safely propel itself over small thresholds and furniture legs.\n- Design score: 5 out of 5\nDreame X50 Ultra: performance\n- Thorough vacuuming, superb mopping, and excellent edge cleaning\n- Threshold clearing is impressive, but descents are alarmingly noisy\n- Pop-down puck consistently identified low thresholds\nAfter a painless five-minute setup and quick mapping, the Dreame X50 Ultra is a dream-e come true, passing almost all of my standard robovac tests with flying colors.\nLet's start with the special features. The tiny legs could be a game-changer for anyone with tall thresholds. The vacuum will square up against the surface and extend its legs to vault itself up and on to the surface. This part is a little slow, but overall works extremely well. You can see it in action below (filmed at a press event, where I could capture a clearer view of the mechanism in action).\nMoving downhill is a little less graceful, and involves charging off the ledge and landing with an alarming crash.\nThe pop-down puck also worked well on test. I found it consistently identified low-threshold obstacles and receded into the vacuum. The inaccessible area beneath my sofa has never been cleaner.\nCleaning tests\nNow on to the general cleaning performance. For this, I ran a range of vacuuming and mopping tests on different floor types.\nOn hard floors, the X50 Ultra Complete was easily able to collect a majority of the large, small and powder debris on its first pass of the area. While its side brush did send some debris flying, the vacuum returned for second and third rounds of cleaning to collect any mess it had missed the first time around. The story was much the same on my low and high-pile carpets, though as I\u2019d expect, there was some residue left behind from the powder and fine debris.\nWhen it comes to mopping, I was most impressed with the X50 Ultra, offering the most thorough mopping I\u2019ve experienced so far, with ample controls in-app to customize your clean. I put the X50 Ultra to the test with sticky spills, wet spills and dried-on stains, and it cleaned each with ease, though did leave some small streaks. You can either mix in the Dreame-approved detergent directly to the water tank or use the built-in automated detergent tank; I found both worked well.\nEdge cleaning is similarly impressive, thanks to the extending side-arm and mop pads, which paired with the X50 Ultra Complete\u2019s excellent mapping to offer the most rigorous edge clean I\u2019ve personally experienced.\nThe X50 Ultra Complete successfully identified all of the flooring types in my apartment, automatically adjusting the level of suction and mopping based on floor type and dirt levels. It features the increasingly popular mop-pad-lifting tech that keeps your carpets from getting soggy.\nBroadly speaking, its obstacle detection is solid, though there were some exceptions; you\u2019ll want to make sure small obstacles like shorter wires, crumpled paper and socks are cleared before setting of the X50 Ultra Complete.\nPoop detection, however, has a quirk. Before I turned on Pet mode, the X50 Ultra Complete repeatedly failed to spot and avoid my mock pet poop. Instead, it barreled headfirst into the fake feces multiple times, especially when navigating between rooms, in low-light or on dark backdrops. However, its dodge rate improved significantly with Pet mode turned on. The X50 was able to avoid my fake pet poop 95% of the time with this mode on. (This is one of the settings we recommend you adjust when using any robot vacuum.)\nMy apartment's skirting boards are difficult to clean even by hand, but the Dreame X50 made a solid attempt when confronted with high voluems fine powder. For spot cleans, it's excellent.\nSimilarly, floor type and dirt detection worked really well for me, and while I\u2019ve seen some reviewers found it didn\u2019t always clock carpet, I didn\u2019t face that issue in my testing. As a result, I also found the lift-off mop pads worked well and kept my carpets nice and dry.\nWhen it\u2019s done with clean-up, the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete returns to its base for self-cleaning and drying, which I was really impressed with. It not only washes the pads with hot water, but also dries them, and uses dual UV lamp bacteria removal technology to keep both the mop pads and the dust bag fresh and clean. Overall, it\u2019s pretty low-maintenance, benefiting further from its effective dual-roller Hypersteam Detangling Duobrush requiring little-to-no hair removal. The side brush, however, is prone to clumps of tangled hair.\nOne of its only other failings is the battery life; Dreame quotes a 200 minute runtime on quiet mode and a 4.5-hour recharge. When tested in my home, I got an average of 90 minutes use out of the vacuum, which is certainly lower than I\u2019d hope for such a pricey device. I\u2019d assume that\u2019s down to some of the more intelligent features, given the Dreame X40 Ultra features the same 6400 mAh battery but fared better in our testing.\n- Performance score: 4.5 out of 5\nShould I buy the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete?\nValue | 4\n| While pricey, the Dreame X50's extensive featurelist helps justify the price tag. Plus, it\u2019s already attracting discounts. |\nDesign | 5 | The Dreame X50 is well and truly decked out with an arsenal of cleaning tools, including threshold-clearing legs and a pop-down puck. |\nPerformance | 4.5 | Excellent vacuuming and mopping, and especially good at edge cleaning. Slightly meagre battery life. |\nBuy it if...\nYou have lots of low-clearance furniture\nIts receding sensor tower gives the X50 Ultra Complete much more mobility to reach and clean beneath low furniture.\nYou want superior edge cleaning\nI was super impressed with the X50 Ultra Complete\u2019s extending side brush and mop pads, which left my dusty corners cleaner than they\u2019ve been in months.\nYou want a seriously low-maintenance robovac\nIt\u2019s self-cleaning, has pretty effective dual brush rollers when it comes to crushing hair and broadly speaking does well at navigating the home, plus the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete comes with an arsenal of spare parts.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou have a larger space\nWhile it will return to base to recharge automatically mid-clean, the limited battery life means cleaning will take longer than usual.\nYou\u2019ve got a messy home\nBroadly, its object detection and navigation specs are great, but the X50 Ultra Complete did struggle on occasion with smaller obstacles, pet poop and the edges of rugs.\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nAt an eyewateringly high price point even during sales, this is far from a budget robovac.\nDreame X50 Ultra Complete: also consider\nRoborock Saros 10\nThe Roborock Saros 10 is probably the most direct competitor to Dreame\u2019s X50 Ultra as of writing, with similar features and functions and also offering great performance. However, it doesn\u2019t have rotating mop pads and can only cross 4cm thresholds, despite being at a very similar price point.\nRead our full Roborock Saros 10 review\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nAt time of writing, this bot sits at the top of our best robot vacuum ranking as the model we recommend to most people. It's significantly cheaper than the Saros 10 but not as cutting-edge. There's no pop-up puck here; threshold clearance is much lower; it can't dispense detergent; plus the dock is significantly less stylish. However, it still cleans extremely well, and the mop is great (it uses the dual spinning pads).\nRead our full Eufy X10 Pro Omni review\nHow I tested the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete\nI used the Dreame X50 Ultra for two months as my primary robot vacuum, completing regular cleaning cycles in addition to my deeper testing. To test pickup performance, I used everything from fine powder (cornflour) to oats and grains to see how well the vacuum clears up debris both in the middle and at the edges of rooms. To test mopping performance, I made wet, sticky and dry spills for the device to clean up, and I also left various obstacles around my flat to test navigation and object detection.I\u2019ve been testing robot vacuums for three years, and in that time I\u2019ve tried everything from cheaper models to premium devices like the Dreame X50 Ultra, which means I\u2019ve got a solid understanding of what makes a robot vacuum worth the money.\nHere's more on how we test robot vacuums\nJosephine Watson (@JosieWatson) is TechRadar's Managing Editor - Lifestyle.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Shark FlexStyle is a versatile multi-styler with a wide range of compatible attachments, making it suitable for different hair types and lengths. It's well-designed, packs a good amount of power, and is comfortable to use. The auto-wrap barrels work as advertised and make this an affordable alternative to the Airwrap. However, we found styles could lack staying power.\nPros\n- +\nGood drying power\n- +\nWide range of attachments\n- +\nBalanced, comfortable design\n- +\nCurl barrels work like an Airwrap\n- +\nExcellent paddle brush\n- +\nWell-built\nCons\n- -\nHave to swap barrels to change curl direction\n- -\nStyles could lack staying power\n- -\nStill quite expensive\n- -\nCord a little short, with power pack\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nShark FlexStyle: two-minute review\nWe have re-reviewed the FlexStyle and thoroughly updated this article to reflect new tests, changes in pricing and availability. The overall score has increased to 3.5. The review incorporates the experiences of three testers.\nThis is the product on review:\nUS: Shark FlexStyle (HD400)\nUK: Shark FlexStyle\nAU: Shark FlexStyle (HD440)\nWe tested the UK version. There may be minor differences between different countries' models.\nThe Shark FlexStyle \u2013 or to give its full name, the Shark FlexStyle Air Styling & Hair Drying System \u2013 is a tube shaped dryer onto which a variety of tools can be attached to achieve a range of styles. We tested one out to see how it compares to the rest of the best hair stylers on the market, and were pretty impressed.\nThis is Shark's answer to the perpetually popular Dyson Airwrap. Just like that multi-styler, the FlexStyle has the all-important auto-wrap curl barrels, shape strands of hair into coils as it dries them, without the need for the scorching heat of traditional curling tongs. Functionally, these work pretty much identically to the Airwrap, although here you'll have to swap over barrels when you want to move from clockwise to anticlockwise curls. That minor annoyance aside, this is one of the very best Dyson Airwrap dupes we've tested.\nOverall, the design is balanced, comfortable to use, and feels well-built. It packs a good amount of power too \u2013 although not quite as much as one of today's best hair dryers. Beyond the auto-wrap barrels, there's a wide range of compatible accessories, which make this tool suitable for a range of hair types and lengths. In some countries you can pick the ones you want included with your FlexStyle bundle, so you're not stuck with a bunch of attachments you don't need, too.\nOn test, we found results varied by tool, with some impressing more than others. Note too that, while using the Coanda effect to create curls is undoubtedly better for your hair, it's fiddlier and the results tend to drop far quicker than when using a traditional curling tong. That's the short version; read on for our full Shark FlexStyle review.\nShark FlexStyle review: price & availability\n- List price: $279.99 / \u00a3269.99 / AU$499.99\n- Launched: 2022\nThe Shark FlexStyle launched back in 2022, and has a list price of $279.99 in the US, \u00a3269.99 in the UK and AU$499.99 in Australia. You can purchase direct from Shark or via a range of third party retailers. Shark is no stranger to a sale, so if you're smart about when you buy, you can avoid paying full price (keep an eye out for a Shark promo codes, too).\nIf you go direct to Shark in the US or UK, you can build your own bundle. You get the base model, and then pick four from the wide range of compatible accessories (the left and right curlers count as one, don't worry!). That's a clever system as it means you can choose only the tools you need for your hair type and routine. You can also purchase accessories individually from Shark.\nYou can pick up styling tools at any price, but you should expect to pay a bit of a premium for one that uses the Coanda effect for curling. The build quality here is good, and wide selection of compatible attachments and convenience of the auto-wrapping curl barrels goes some way towards justifying the expense.\nThe main competitor in this area is the Dyson Airwrap. The previous model (which it's still possible to get hold of... for now) comes with a list price of $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$849.99, and the newest iteration, the Airwrap i.d., is $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / $849. So a lot pricier than the Shark. That styler does feel more premium, though, and does some useful things the FlexStyle cannot.\nAs time has gone on, we've seen more Airwrap dupes arriving on the market, and some are significantly cheaper even than the FlexStyle. For example, in the US there's the Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler for $269.99, and in the UK the Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler for \u00a3179.99.\n- Value for money score: 3.5 out of 5\nShark FlexStyle specs\nWattage: | 1400W (US), 1600W (UK) |\nTemperature settings: | 3 + cool shot |\nSpeed settings: | 3 |\nCord: | 8ft / 2.4m |\nSize w/ no attachments (L x W): | 11.3 x 1.7\" / 28.7 x 4.4cm |\nWeight w/ no attachments: | 1.5 lbs |\nAttachment options (vary by country): | 1.25\" auto-wrap curlers (L + R), 0.95\" auto-wrap curlers (L + R), concentrator, round bristle brush, paddle brush, oval bristle brush, wide tooth comb, diffuser, 'FrizzFighter' finishing tool |\nShark FlexStyle review: design\n- Easy-to-reach and use controls\n- Well-balanced and comfortable to hold\n- Attachments are sturdily built, and come on and off easily\nThe design comprises a tube-shaped dryer with various attachments. The main barrel feels balanced and fairly lightweight, with a 5.5-inch circumference that fits neatly in the palm of your hand. On the barrel you'll find the controls \u2013 an on/off toggle, buttons to adjust windspeed and temperature (there are three settings for each, with indicator lights showing which mode you're in), and a button higher up the barrel for the cool shot.\nThe dryer itself looks and feels high quality, although not quite as premium as the Airwrap. We've tested both the gold and back colorways, and far prefer the latter \u2013 the beige attachments on the gold model look rather cheap, and become dirty easily.\nThe top section pivots and locks at a right angle, reducing the length from 11.3 inches to around 8.5 inches and making it very comfortable to use as a hair dryer.\nAdding attachments makes it rather long \u2013 the 6-inch auto-wrap barrels take the total length of the styler to a somewhat cumbersome 17.5 inches \u2013 but it's a testament to Shark's engineering that it remains well balanced no matter which attachment you use. This, coupled with its light weight, makes even the most complex and long-winded styles comfortable to complete.\nWhile it\u2019s true the Shark FlexStyle can replace a number of your existing hair tools, don\u2019t expect it to save you a lot of space in the process, as many of the attachments are rather bulky. One of our review samples came with a display box, which is large but looks smart and at least gives you somewhere to stash away all the various bits neatly. (The box isn't generally included as standard, but is one of the options in the build your own bundle.)\nA minor complaint is that the cable is thick and has a power pack around a third of the way down. This makes it difficult to wrap or coil neatly for storage, and the power pack adds what feels like an unnecessary amount of bulk when lifting the styler above and around your head. Said cable is also slightly shorter than we'd ideally like, at 8ft / 2.4m.\nAttachments\nThe FlexStyle initially launched with a relatively limited range of attachments, but in the years since has added more options. Now, it boasts one of the widest ranges of compatible attachments of any multi-styler... although the selection still isn't quite as comprehensive as the Airwrap's. (Note these may vary slightly by country.) For our review, we tested the following attachments:\n- 1.25\" auto-wrap curlers\n- Concentrator\n- Paddle brush\n- Oval bristle brush\n- Diffuser\nAlso available, but not tested here, are:\n- 0.95\" auto-wrap curlers\n- Round bristle brush\n- Wide tooth comb\n- 'FrizzFighter' finishing tool (to rival Dyson's popular Flyaway tool).\nThese all snap on easily, and can be released by pulling down the lock button. They also have cool-touch areas so you can remove them without burning your fingers.\nThe auto-wrap curlers have a classy matte finish and are marked with arrows so you can see at a glance if it's a clockwise or anti-clockwise barrel. Both the oval and paddle brushes are on the large side, much larger than the size of a regular hairbrush, and certainly geared towards those with longer, thicker hair (it looks like the round bristle brush would be a better fit for mid-length locks). The diffuser is also rather chunky, and features a slider switch that enables you to extend the length of the prongs, making it suitable for longer hair.\n- Design score: 4 out of 5\nShark FlexStyle review: performance\n- Intuitive controls and easy to get started with\n- Fast overall drying speeds\n- Performance and finish vary depending on the attachment\nOverall, the styler is well balanced, not too heavy, and comfortable to use. It's also easy to get started with, although mastering each of the attachments can take a bit longer \u2013 as we'll get into in a second.\nThe settings buttons are placed at the bottom of the barrel, rather than higher up where they might be accidentally switched while gripping the styler. They're easy enough to reach if you do need to make changes mid-style, and the fact they're on a flattened section means you can locate them fairly easily by touch. However, they do sit alongside the air vents for the motor, which means you can block airflow when switching between modes.\nTo set the styler into right-angled hair dryer mode, you pull down a switch on the barrel\u2019s handle and twist the top section. In this mode, it's easy to direct the airflow precisely where it's needed. It also makes it comfortable to use with the diffuser or diffuser attached.\nThe hair dryer on its own is fast and effective. It took our fine-haired tester 2 minutes and 47 seconds to go from wet to dry hair, putting it on par with the original Dyson Supersonic. Her hair was a little frizzy and flat when dried in this way, but no more or less than when drying with other hairdryers.\nTo add attachments, turn and lock them into place and then use the unlock switch on the barrel to release them with ease. The use of an unlock switch may seem unnecessary, but it prevents the attachments from twisting and moving mid-style \u2013 a common complaint of other hair dryers and cheaper multi-stylers we've used in the past.\nAuto-wrap curl barrels\nProbably the biggest selling point of the FlexStyle is the promise of effortless curling with minimal heat damage using the auto-wrap curlers. To get the most out of these attachments, you should start by drying hair until it's around 80% dry \u2013 you can use the styler in hair dryer mode to take care of this. Achieving the optimum level of moisture in the hair requires a bit of trial and error \u2013 too wet or too dry, and the curls won't hold.\nMastering the Coanda technology also takes a bit of time, although once you've got it, it's fairly straightforward. You want to section off a bit of hair, switch the styler on and position the barrel in the bottom third of the hair. You'll see the strands start twisting around the barrel, and moving the wand backwards and forwards slightly will cause the rest of it to wrap too. The hot air then shapes the curl as it finishes drying the hair. For best results, you'll need to hit the cool shot button to set the curl before removing the wand.\nHere, the matte finish on curl barrels adds slight grip on the hair, which one of our thick-haired testers found hindered the wrapping process a little, although those with finer, slipperier hair might actually find it helps.\nIt's not a perfect system. Swapping over the barrels when you want to change the direction of curl is annoying. The air can pull in hair from other sections, or blow it in various directions while you\u2019re setting each curl, creating frizz and flyaways. All three of our testers found their curls dropped much faster than those created using a traditional tong (although our tester with thick, straight hair found that curls on day-old hair had more staying power than on freshly washed hair).\nWe will emphasize, though, that this is true of all Coanda effect curlers we've tried. You won't end up with perfect, long-lasting curls with this method, but you can achieve good body and waves with minimal heat damage.\nIf you opt to pay more for an Airwrap i.d., you'll get the convenience of not having to swap barrels to change from clockwise to anticlockwise, and there's a switch that kicks off a curl cycle (wrap, curl, cool shot) timed to your hair type, so you won't need to mess around with changing settings mid-curl. However, functionally the wrapping process and results will be very similar.\nBrush attachments\nIf you're using the oval or paddle brush, you can expect drying times to be a little longer, because you're styling as you dry. These are both fairly intuitive in use, and require far less of learning curve than the auto-wrap barrels. The large size means they're best suited to longer, thicker hair.\nTo get real volume using the oval brush, you\u2019ll need to spend time working on the roots, holding your hair straight up (or at right angles to your head), placing the brush on the underside of your hair at the base and running it up and through each strand multiple times. You can also hold the brush at the base while it sets the volume, before smoothing the rest of the hair, or rotating it as you move it through to create flicks or large curls and waves.\nOur fine-haired tester found this method gave her hair decent volume to begin with, but the style fell flat within half an hour. The large size of the oval brush makes it much better suited to long hair than short.\nThe paddle brush is used for creating smooth styles, and to use it you simply run it through strands of hair like you would a regular hair brush, keeping it face-down to smooth the cuticles. If you want to add subtle volume, angle the paddle brush up and under your roots for a few seconds before each pass. On test we found this created a smooth finish, with very little frizz. Our fine-haired tester was particularly impressed, and noted that she usually had to resort to straighteners to gain such a sleek, straight look.\n- Performance score: 3.5 out of 5\nShould I buy a Shark FlexStyle?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Premium priced, as expected for a multi-styler that uses the Coanda effect.

All used the FlexStyle extensively over at least a couple of weeks, trying out all the supplied attachments. We noted how intuitive and comfortable it was to use, and how the results matched up to other styling tools we'd used. We also assessed how fast it was to style hair, and how long the results lasted.\nRead more about how we test\n- Re-reviewed March 2025\n- First reviewed October 2022\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "The best hair styler 2025: tools to shape, smooth and curl\nWe've tested dozens of hair styling tools \u2013 these came out on top\nOne of the best hair stylers could transform your morning routine. These tools can help you smooth, dry, curl and shape your locks \u2013 and sometimes all of the above, using different attachments. In this guide, we've rounded up a range of tried and tested multi-stylers, all of which can help you achieve salon-worthy looks with minimal time and effort.\nOf course, not all hair styler tools are created equal, and some are more suited to particular hair types, lengths or styles. Our experts have put all these stylers through their paces and can recommend who they will and won't suit. Many of these tools can be used to dry and smooth hair, but if you'd prefer a dedicated tool we have separate guides to the best hair dryers and best hair straighteners on the market. Want something more versatile? Read on for our pick of the best hair stylers you can buy.\nThe best hair styling tool: quick list\nTop tool\nBest overall\nThe Airwrap i.d. is a top-quality, premium styler that's perfect for creating curls, waves and sleek blowout styles with minimal heat. It's not cheap, but the dupes can't compete.\nGreat value\nBest affordable\nIt's no Airwrap in terms of quality, but this Revamp multi-styler has a lot of the same functions and comes with a far lower price tag. UK only.\nBrilliant brush\nBest brush dryer\nIf you're after a brush dryer to add body, this one is affordable and effective. It does just one thing, but it does it well.\nWet-to-straight\nBest straightening\nThe Airstrait dries and smooths hair at the same time, for natural-looking straight hair without the need for hair-frying hot plates.\nVersatile\nVersatile multi-styler\nShark's answer to the Airwrap, the FlexStyle is an all-in-one hair dryer and versatile multi-styling tool, with a wide range of attachments.\nBudget friendly\nCheap multi-styler\nWant lots of options without breaking the bank? This is the best budget multi-styler we've tested out.\nThe best multi-styler overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Dyson Airwrap i.d. takes everything that was great about the original multistyler, and adds a new feature that's a complete game-changer. If you can afford it, this is the best hair styling tool on the market.\nThe original Airwrap rose to popularity for introducing a new, healthier way to create curls. Rather than applying extreme heat with a traditional curling tong, this tool harnesses a phenomenon called the coanda effect to cause hair to wrap itself around the barrel, shaping it and setting it into curls using just air. The i.d. version adds an i.d.curl switch that launches an automated curling sequence (wrap > curl > cool shot), taking all the guesswork out the process and making it absolutely effortless.\nWhere the Airwrap i.d. really shines is when creating curls, but there's a wide range of other compatible tools that increase its versatility. It can be used as just a hair dryer, and there are various brush attachments for creating bouncy blow-dries, a diffuser and wide-tooth comb attachments for curls and coils, and a flyaway smoother, amongst other things.\nThe sticking point for many will be the price \u2013 there's no getting around the fact that the Airwrap i.d. is extremely expensive. There are other multistylers in this list that also use the coanda effect to create curls (see the Revamp at #2 and Shark at #5) but none that can create clockwise or anticlockwise curls on the same barrel, and none that offer an automated curl sequence.\nRead our full Dyson Airwrap i.d. review\nThe best affordable multi-styler\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler is the best budget multi-styler we've tested, as well as being one of the best Airwrap dupes if you can't stretch to the real thing (it's UK only \u2013 US shoppers should hop down to the slightly pricier Shark FlexStyle at #5).\nLike many modern multi-stylers, the design combines a tube-shaped dryer \u2013 the top of which pivots for more comfortable drying \u2013 and various attachments for different styling tasks. These include the all-important auto-wrapping curl barrels, which we found worked just as well as any we've tried (although you will have to manually swap them over when you want to switch from clockwise to anticlockwise curls, unlike on the Airwrap).\nThere's a decent selection of attachments \u2013 the two auto-wrap curl barrels, a concentrator, flat paddle brush, large oval bristle brush with ceramic barrel and a round barrel with retractable bristles. It's only the last of these that our tester was unimpressed with, and we particularly like the large bristle brush for adding volume. Other brands' efforts have a wider selection of compatible attachments, but most bases are covered here, with the notable exception of a diffuser.\nAlthough it understandably doesn't feel ultra-premium, the build quality is decent and functions as intended \u2013 all the attachments clip on and off easily and feel secure in use, for example. The helpful addition of an easily accessible \"pause\" button means you can remove the wand without disturbing your curls. In fact, our only real complaint was that it was a little too easy to accidentally change the settings mid-style.\nIn general, Revamp is worth checking out if you're looking for a cheap multi-styler. The even more affordable Progloss appears in our list at #6.\nRead more in our Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler review\nThe best hair brush dryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're on a tighter budget and want something that'll help you create bouncy blow-dries, Revlon's Pro Collection One Step is the best brush dryer we've tried. It's not much to look at, but it really delivers when it comes to results \u2013 and it's extremely affordable too.\nThis kind of hair styler tool dries and shapes your hair at the same time. It's quite heavy, but on test our reviewer found it was so efficient that the extra weight didn't really matter. There are just two drying settings: lower powered and less hot, or higher powered and hotter. The higher setting created an irritating noise, but our tester found the lower setting was powerful enough that she never had to use anything else. The large barrel enables you to tackle large sections at a time, and its oval shape makes it easy to create volume at the root.\nAlthough the design isn't perfect, the results more than made up for any flaws: the Revlon Pro Collection One Step consistently left our reviewer's hair sleek, bouncy and voluminous. If you're seeking more versatility \u2013 including the ability to create curls \u2013 there are plenty of multi-stylers in this list to choose from. But for bouncy blow-dries on a budget, this is the tool for you.\nRead more in our Revlon Pro Collection One Step Dryer and Volumiser review\nThe best straightening tool\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Dyson Airstrait uses an angled blade of focused airflow to dry and straighten at the same time \u2013 meaning you can use it on wet hair. Its design has an 80s sci-fi vibe and swaps the usual straightener hot plates for unheated panels, with vents to deliver the air.\nAt 1.18lb / 536g, the Airstrait is heavier than a traditional straightener, but it makes light work of drying/straightening hair, with our reviewer able to achieve both in 10 minutes, less than half the time it would take to dry and straighten her hair usually. It has some neat features too: one that adjusts the volume of airflow when hair is in it, and another that cuts airflow when its arms have been open for more than three seconds.\nOur reviewer found that there was little-to-no hair snagging or sizzling and that the Airstrait was able to dry segments of her hair with just one pass. Its results were natural-looking straight hair rather than pin straight, however, and the Airstrait can't get right up to the root, so may not be as effective for those with tight curls.\nTalking of curls, what the Airstrait is not so good at is creating them \u2013 for that, you'll want the Airwrap (#1) or another multi-styler. However, if you have wavy or slightly curly hair and are looking for a styling tool that will help you smooth things out without damaging your locks, the Airstrait would make an excellent choice. It's expensive, but top quality, and there's nothing else like it on the market right now.\nRead our full Dyson Airstrait review\nAnother versatile hair styler\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Shark FlexStyle Air Styling & Hair Drying System is a hair tool with a range of useful attachments for creating different styles. It's Shark's answer to the Airwrap (#1); it comes with very similar auto-wrapping curl barrels, which create curls using directed air, resulting in less heat damage than traditional tongs. However, unlike with the Airwrap, you'll need to manually swap over the barrels to create clockwise and anti-clockwise curls, and there's no automated curl sequence.\nYou can also use the FlexStyle as a dryer \u2013 the pivotable top section makes it comfortable to hold and easy to direct the airflow in this mode. Plus, there are brush tools, a concentrator and a diffuser that can be snapped on for different looks. In some countries you can build your own bundle, and choose only the attachments you'll actually use, which is a neat option.\nPrice-wise, it's much more affordable than an Airwrap, although still not super-cheap. The quality is fine (the black version looks and feels more premium than the beige one) but it's still worth keeping an eye out for a deal if you decide this is the hair tool for you. Shark loves a sale, so you shouldn't have to wait too long.\nRead more in our Shark FlexStyle review\nThe best cheap multi-styler\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Revamp Progloss Airstyle 6-in-1Air Styler DR-1250, or the Revamp Progloss, is a very budget-friendly multi-styler that comes with with six attachments \u2013 a wide-bristle brush, a paddle brush and a rotating hard bristle brush, which is designed for creating soft waves. There's also a conical attachment for creating curls, a drying attachment and a diffuser.\nThe dryer works well, drying our reviewer's hair in just over four minutes. And in our tests, the smaller barrel brush and paddle brush were particularly suited to fine hair. The larger rotating brush worked well in that it was easy to wind hair around the barrel, but the barrel itself was too wide for clearly defined waves on shoulder length hair, suggesting this tool may work better with longer hair. Elsewhere, our reviewer found it hard to grip the air styler when creating curls, due to the length of the handle.\nThe Progloss was also rather noisy at 80dB. Saying that, we'd recommend the Progloss to those who want to create a variety of styles without spending big.\nRead more in our Revamp Progloss Airstyle 6-in-1Air Styler DR-1250 review\nHow to choose a hair styler tool\nWhen choosing a hair styler, you first need to consider what you want to achieve. Are you looking to create waves, straight locks or to enhance or define existing curls? If there's only one style you know you'll want to create most of the time then you may want to choose a hair styler dedicated to that function, or if you want to be able to mix up styles then a multi styler may be better for you.\nAlso think about your hair type \u2013 some tools are better suited to some hair types than others. We've indicated where this is the case in our list.\nIt's also worth considering design and portability, do you need something that will travel easily or will your tool likely stay in one place? Do you have the space to keep several accessories and a large hair styler tool or do you need something that's relatively compact? Is an included carry case important to you?\nBudget will also likely play a key part in your decision. The price of hair stylers ranges from relatively inexpensive 2-in-1 hair brush dryers to multi-stylers, which vary in price, with Dyson being the most expensive.\nWhat is the best hair styling tool brand?\nThere are a number of brands in the hair styling tool market. Dyson is top of the range in terms of price and quality, but elsewhere there's Shark, Revlon, Remington, BaByliss, plus GHD and T3.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRosie is deputy editor of TechRadar's sister design site, Creative Bloq.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro looks great, comes in at a fairly affordable price, and includes a strong selection of styling attachments. However, it's let down by a maximum temperature that's too cool to dry anything but the finest of hair, and attachments that don't clip on securely enough. It has tons of potential, but it's hard to recommend given there are similarly priced alternatives available without its flaws.\nPros\n- +\nPremium look and feel\n- +\nComfortable to use\n- +\nWell-positioned controls\n- +\nAuto-wrap curl barrels\nCons\n- -\nNot hot enough as a dryer\n- -\nAttachments don't clip on securely\n- -\nStyles lack staying power\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDreame AirStyle Pro: two-minute review\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro is a multistyler that can operate as a dryer, or to create smooth, curly or bouncy styles using the various attachments supplied in the box. On paper, it looks like one for TechRadar's best hair styler roundup, but when I actually put it through its paces, a couple of design flaws quickly revealed themselves \u2013 and they're annoying enough to make this styler difficult to recommend.\nThe first is that the maximum temperature just isn't hot enough. I have collarbone-length, wavy hair that isn't overly thick, yet I wasn't able to use the Dreame AirStyle to dry it \u2013 it just took far too long. I also found that the styles created using the Dreame (in particular, the curls) lacked staying power. I'm as concerned about heat damage as the next person, but you do need some heat for these kinds of tools to be useful.\nThe second issue is that the attachments don't clip on securely enough. They twist on, but there's no 'click' at the end of that motion, which means they have a tendency to twist off again as you're using them to style.\nIt's a shame because, as I've said, the Dreame AirStyle Pro shows plenty of promise. The attachments are varied and well designed, and include those all-important auto-wrap curl barrels that position this styler as an Airwrap alternative. It's also stylishly designed and comfortable to use, with controls that are well positioned.\nPrice-wise, it isn't cheap, but it's far more affordable than Dyson's Airwrap i.d., and in line with rival products. While the Dreame AirStyle Pro's issues might not be insurmountable \u2013 you could rope in one of the best hair dryers for the start of the styling process, and take extra care not to dislodge the attachments when styling \u2013 there's no real reason to choose it over a tool such as the Shark FlexStyle, which comes in at a similar price and doesn't suffer the Dreame AirStyle Pro's issues.\nThat's the short version; read on for my full Dreame AirStyle Pro review.\nDreame AirStyle Pro review: price & availability\n- List price: $399.99 / \u00a3299 / AU$599\n- Available: US / UK / Australia\n- Launched: May 2025\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro is available worldwide, with a list price of $399.99 / \u00a3299 / AU$599. However, at time of writing, it was reduced in all territories to $279.99 / \u00a3269 / AU$399. Such widespread discounts suggest you won't often find it at full price.\nBy comparison, the Dyson Airwrap i.d. costs $599.99 / \u00a3479.99, while the Shark FlexStyle comes in at $279.99 / \u00a3269.99. While Dyson's styler delivers a step up in quality and features, it looks like Dreame is looking to position itself more directly as a competitor to Shark. (There are cheaper Dyson Airwrap dupes, but if you want one with the auto-wrap curl barrels, it will typically fall into a similar price bracket.)\nWhile the AirStyle Pro looks good, feels high quality, and comes with a solid range of accessories, there are a couple of flaws at a functional level (a top temperature that's far too cool, and attachments that don't clip on securely) that make it difficult to recommend over the similarly priced Shark version.\nThere's a clear jump up in quality and functionality with the Dyson i.d., but I appreciate that not everyone is looking to splash that amount of cash on a styling tool (I compare all three in a bit more depth in this article, if you're interested).\n- Value for money score: 3 out of 5\nDreame AirStyle Pro specs\nWeight (styler only, no cord): | 0.6lbs / 0.3kg |\nDimensions (styler only): | 1.8 x 1.8 x 10.2in / 4.5 x 4.5 x 26cm |\nCord: | 9.2ft / 2.8m |\nTemperatures: | 2 (50C and 80C) + cool shot (room temperature) |\nSpeeds: | 3 (50m/s, 55m/s, 60m/s) |\nWattage: | 1,300W |\nAttachments: | Fast dryer, flyaway attachment, 32mm auto-wrap barrels (L+R), hard smoothing brush, soft smoothing brush, round volumizing brush |\nDreame AirStyle Pro review: design\n- Tubular dryer with six styling attachments and storage box\n- Attachments twist on, but aren't secure enough\n- Stylish, premium design with leather-look finish\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro has a similar look to most modern multistylers: it comprises a tube-shaped dryer onto which different attachments are clipped.\nAt the end of the barrel that you hold it are the controls. Two press buttons (with indicator lights) let you toggle though two temperatures and three windspeeds. Slightly unusually, the \"cool shot\" isn't a separate button, but included as an extension of the on/off slider.\nAt the base is a removable filter cage, covering a stainless steel mesh filter that traps any fine hair and particles and keeps them out of the motor. Dreame provides a cleaner brush to help with maintenance. The cable is 9.2ft / 2.8m.\nIf you want to use the AirStyle Pro as just a dryer, you clip on the fast dryer attachment. This widens the airflow to 90-degrees to the dryer.\nAside from that, the key attachments are the 32mm auto-wrap curl barrels. Used on slightly damp hair, they attract the strands around the barrel, shaping them into curls as they dry. The idea being that this damp to dry styling is far better for your hair than using traditional hot tongs.\nIf you want to switch from clockwise to anticlockwise curls then you'll need to swap over the barrels. Currently, the only styler of this kind that can achieve two directions of curl on one barrel is the Dyson Airwrap; all the cheaper alternatives require a manual swap-over.\nElsewhere, there's an impressive range of attachments. Alongside the fast dryer and auto-wrap barrels (L+R), you get a flyaway attachment, hard smoothing brush, soft smoothing brush, and round volumizing brush.\nTo attach a tool to the dryer section, you line up spots on the base of the attachments, then twist to clip them on. Most examples of this kind of styler have a release switch around the back, but there isn't one here \u2013 you simply twist in terms of opposite direction to take off the attachment. Unfortunately, this setup isn't that secure, and in my time with the tool I often experienced attachments becoming loose mid-styling.\n- Design score: 3.5 out of 5\nDreame AirStyle Pro review: performance\n- Not hot enough to be used as a hair dryer\n- Controls are well positioned and easy to use\n- Attachments work well, but lack of heat limits performance\nI started by using the Dreame AirStyle Pro with the fast dryer attachment \u2013 and I immediately ran into problems. While the windspeed felt decent, it just wasn't getting hot enough to dry hair, even on the higher of the two temperatures. (For context, I have collarbone-length hair that I'd towel-dried from wet, so it wasn't soaking.) After several long minutes of ineffectually waving the AirStyle over my head, I gave up and switched to a dedicated hair dryer.\nI wondered if my review model was faulty, but a closer look at the specs revealed this wasn't the case. The AirStyle's two heat options are 122\u00baF / 50\u00baC and 176\u00baF / 80\u00baC. In comparison, the Airwrap has a low heat setting of 140\u00baF / 60\u00baC and a high heat setting of 194\u00baF / 90\u00baC.\nThat cooler temperature might be better for your hair, but for anyone other than those with super-fine hair, the AirStyle Pro will prove ineffective and you'll need to have a separate hair dryer on hand for this part of the styling process.\nI then tried out the auto-wrap curlers. They worked well, effectively pulling around the barrels and holding it there as it finished drying. In this part, they were similar to the Airwrap (although the Airwrap has some extra features to make the process more straightforward). As a general rule, auto-wrapped curls don't last as long as those created using hot tongs, but I found the curls created with the AirStyle Pro dropped especially quickly \u2013 again, I think this is something to do with the lower temperatures used.\nOn the plus side, the styler is comfortable to hold and balanced in weight. The buttons are well positioned, making them easy to find mid-styling and difficult to press accidentally.\nI especially like the way the cool shot is activated. It's at the top of the on/off slider, so you can easily locate the raised button by feel alone, and since it's spring-loaded, it pings back when you let go.\nOver the course of my review period, I tested out all the other attachments. Broadly, I felt they were well designed and did what they were meant to do. However, as mentioned, they don't attach securely \u2013 they simply twist on and off, with no clipping involved.\nThis proved an issue when doing anything that involved twisting the tool, and when creating curls using the round volumizing brush, I found it became loose and fell off on more than one occasion.\nThe hard smoothing brush and soft smoothing brush both feature prongs that can pivot slightly \u2013 I'm not sure of their purpose \u2013 and they worked well in practice. In fact, the two are virtually identical, except the latter has bobbles on the end of the prongs, so I'm not sure I needed both.\n- Performance score: 2.5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Dreame AirStyle Pro?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Not cheap but relatively affordable.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 multi-styler is one of the best affordable Airwrap alternatives I've tested. The auto-wrap curl attachments work well (it's annoying to have to swap the barrel to change curl direction, but it's only the official Airwrap that avoids that), and the oval bristle brush is perfect for bouncy blow-dries. The Revamp sports good design, and I particularly appreciated the long cable. While the styler doesn't quite compare to the Dyson Airwrap, when it comes to what it offers for the price, it puts other dupes to shame.\nPros\n- +\nAuto-wrap barrels work well\n- +\nOval bristle brush is great\n- +\nCan create a range of styles\n- +\nLow price for this kind of styler\n- +\nLong cable\nCons\n- -\nEasy to accidentally change settings\n- -\nHave to swap barrels to change direction of curl\n- -\nRetractable curl barrel pointless\n- -\nLimited compatible accessories\n- -\nDoesn't feel hugely premium\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nRevamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler: two-minute review\nThe Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro is a multi-styler that combines a tube-shaped dryer (with a pivotable top), with various attachments for different styling tasks. I tested one out to see how it compares to the rest of the best hair styling tools on the market, and thought it delivered plenty for the price.\nPerhaps the most interesting of the attachments are the two auto-wrapping curl barrels. This type of styler has seen a rise in popularity because it lets you create curls without the need for the extreme temperatures of a traditional curling tong. The barrels here work very well, pulling the hair around the body and shaping it into a curl as styler dries it.\nOne irritation is the need to manually swap over the barrels if you want to change the direction of curl from clockwise to anticlockwise. However, it's only the Dyson Airwrap that does away with this, and that styler is far more expensive. I'd still consider this Revamp styler among the best Dyson Airwrap alternatives for those on a budget. It's particularly great value when pitted against other dupes, even if it doesn't quite match up to the original in terms of performance and features.\nElsewhere, I was a big fan of the large oval bristle brush, which is great for creating bouncy blow-dries. All the attachments came on and off easily and felt secure, and while the range of compatible tools isn't as extensive as with alternatives, the main bases are covered. There's an easily accessible \"pause\" button to switch off the blower when you want to remove the wand without disturbing your curls, although I did find it was a little too easy to accidentally change the settings mid-style in general. As a dryer it works fine, but you'll want to supplement it with a dedicated dryer if you hair is long and/or thick (here's our pick of the best hair dryers around).\nThat's the short version. Now read on for my full Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler review.\nRevamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler review: price & availability\n- List price: \u00a3179.99\n- Available: UK\nThe Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler is available in the UK only. You can pick it up direct from Revamp, or via third-party retailers such as Amazon, Very and Argos.\nIts \u00a3179.99 list price is super reasonable for this type of multi-styler with auto-wrapping curl barrels. It's significantly cheaper than the market leader in this area, the Dyson Airwrap; the current version of which costs around \u00a3479.99 (although we have seen it discounted to \u00a3399.99). Having said that, the Airwrap is notably better, offering better build quality and more advanced features.\nThe Shark FlexStyle at \u00a3299.99 might appear a closer match to the Revamp in terms of build and features; functionally, the two are very similar. However, the FlexStyle does feel more premium and comes with a diffuser.\n- Value for money score: 4 out of 5\nRevamp Dynamic Radiance 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler specs\nMotor: | Brushless, rotates at 110,000rpm |\nHeat settings: | 3 + cool shot |\nSpeed settings: | 3 + pause |\nCord: | 3m |\nAttachments: | Concentrator, oval brush, paddle brush, left and right curl barrels, retractable round brush |\nSize w/ no attachments: | 11.7in / 29.7cm (L); / 1.7in / 4.4cm (diameter at widest point) |\nRevamp Dynamic Radiance 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler review: design\n- Tube-shaped dryer with top that can pivot to an angle\n- 7 attachments, including clockwise and anticlockwise curl barrels\n- 3 windspeeds, 3 heat settings, cool shot and pause function\nThe Revamp Dynamic Radiance 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler is a tube-shaped dryer that arrives with various attachments that can be switched out for different styling tasks.\nLet's start with the main machine. It's 11.7 inches / 29.7cm in length, with a tapering barrel that's 1.7 inches / 4.4cm at its widest point. Inside, there's a brushless motor that spins at up to 110,000rpm, and is apparently capable of windspeeds of up to 150km per hour. The Revamp styler is described as \"intelligent\" on the brand's website, but I remain unsure as to exactly how that might be. Like most modern hair dryers, the Revamp uses ion technology to reduce frizz and create a smoother look.\nAt the bottom of the main dryer you'll find a vent that's home to a dual filter. The plastic outer casing twists off to reveal a finer mesh filter inside, which you can brush clean.\nMoving up the machine you'll find your controls. First, an on-off toggle switch, followed by your windspeed and heat controls. Press these buttons to cycle through low, medium and high settings, and small lights above each button will illuminate to indicate the mode you're on. Slightly oddly, pressing again when you're on the max mode takes you to medium rather than bumping you right down to low.\nAbove this sits a Pause button. Pressing it will cut out the blower but retain your heat and windspeed choices. The machine also remembers your preferences when toggling on and off, so an extra Pause isn't essential, although it is easier to reach mid-style. Finally, the cool shot button needs to be continually pressed for cool air. To make this easier, the button itself curves outwards, while the others curve inwards.\nThe Revamp styler is mains powered, and comes with a long 3-meter cord (many dryers have 2.5m cords, which is a touch too short in my opinion). This can rotate as required, for greater manoeuvrability.\nYou can use the main body of the styler on its own as a hair dryer. For this, you twist the very top so that section sits at a right angle to the handle. There's a toggle switch to open the release mechanism.\nThe Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro hair styler comes with six styling attachments. These twist onto the top of the dryer, and lock in place. The attachments are:\n- Concentrator with 0.5cm opening \u2013 for straight styles\n- Flat paddle brush \u2013 for smooth blow-dries\n- Large oval bristle brush with ceramic barrel (diameter 4.6 x 7.2cm) \u2013 for bouncy blow-dries\n- Clockwise and anticlockwise curl barrels (diameter 3cm) \u2013 for curls\n- Round barrel with retractable bristles \u2013 for curls\nUsefully, a drawstring bag is supplied for storing all these add-ons. You can use the attachments with the dryer section straight or angled \u2013 the latter will perhaps be a more comfortable position for using the concentrator.\n- Design score: 4 out of 5\nRevamp Dynamic Radiance 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler review: performance\n- Easy to accidentally change settings in use\n- Dryer isn't especially powerful on its own (although acceptable)\n- Auto-curl barrels work well, and large oval brush is great\nAs a hair dryer alone, the Revamp Dynamic Radiance 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler isn't especially powerful. I tend to dry my hair to 80 per cent before styling, and I found that took a frustratingly long time using the Revamp. I ended up switching to my Dyson Nural Supersonic to speed up the process. It's common that the dryers on these kinds of multi-stylers aren't especially powerful, so this wasn't a surprise.\nThe styler didn't prove too heavy in use, and its angled head made it more comfortable for drying. I also appreciated the long, 3m cord, which gave me plenty of freedom to move it around.\nThe attachments are straightforward to attach and detach, and have sections that remain cool in use. That's useful when it comes to removing them, and also means that, for example, you can hold the top of the oval brush when using it for greater control.\nMoving on to the attachments themselves, and I'll start with the auto-curl barrels. These work exactly as stated, with the directed air encouraging the hair to wrap around the barrel, where it is shaped into a curl as it dries. In terms of the actual process, it's similar to the Airwrap; but there are some areas where the Revamp tool falls down in comparison with the (far pricier) Dyson version.\nNamely, the Revamp requires you to swap to a second barrel when you want to move from creating clockwise curls to anticlockwise ones. For a natural curly look, you'll really want curls that alternate direction, and it's more of a faff with the Revamp setup. There's also only one length of barrel available. The curling part of each (excluding stay-cool tip and twist-on mechanism) is about 6 inches / 15.3cm long, which worked fine for my collarbone-length hair, but may prove difficult with hair of longer length or a thicker texture. Alternatives provide more options here.\nOnce the hair has dried into a curl shape, you can hit the cool shot button to set it in place. Here, the Pause function proved useful \u2013 it's a little easier to reach than the on-off toggle, enabling you to remove the wand without disturbing the curl. (The newest Airwrap i.d. will create a curl-creating routine for you, where the styler will cycle through all these stages automatically; but you can't expect that kind of functionality at this price point.)\nOf the two blow-dry brushes, I was most impressed by the large oval brush. It's big enough to create volume, and the nylon bristles help grip hair to create tension, so the strands aren't just hanging limply over the brush. It's big, though \u2013 and again, there's only one size. The cool shot doesn't work too well with this attachment \u2013 because the whole brush heats up during use, and so does the air being pushed through it.\nI was less enamoured with the retractable curling barrel. Unlike the clockwise and anticlockwise curl barrels, the hair won't automatically wrap itself around this wand. You have to do it manually, and because there's air blowing out from the vents, you'll find the hair wants to go in this is the direction, too.\nWhen using the Revamp to curl, you twist the top of the attachment to cause its prongs to pop out and in, the idea being that you create the curl with them out, then shift them in to remove the tong without disturbing the curl. It sort of makes sense as an idea, but in practice you're better off using the auto-wrapping barrels. In my opinion, Revamp would have been better dropping this functionality in place of an extra attachment \u2013 a diffuser being the obvious inclusion.\n- Performance score: 3.5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Revamp Dynamic Radiance 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Affordable for this kind of multi-styler; quality is decent for the price. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Tube-shaped dryer with 7 swappable attachments, including auto-wrap curl barrels. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Generally very good \u2013 especially the large oval brush, and auto-curl barrels (although having to switch out barrels to change curl direction is annoying). Buttons easy to press accidentally. | 3.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want an Airwrap dupe\nIt can't quite compete with an Airwrap, but it does do a similar job. In particular, the iconic auto-wrap curl barrels function almost identically to the Airwrap, aside from the fact you can't change the direction of your curl here without swapping over to a second barrel.\nYou're on a tight budget\nThis is one of the most affordable Airwrap alternatives around; other dupes offer similar functionality but at a much higher price. However, although cheaper and offering a broadly similar functionality to the Airwrap, it can't compete on quality.\nYou want to be able to create bouncy blow-dries\nThe oval bristle brush is particularly effective here, and perfect for adding volume as you finish drying your hair.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou can afford an Airwrap\nThe Airwrap i.d. is much better quality and comes with a range of extra, useful functions. It's significantly more expensive than this Revamp option, but perhaps worth it if you're enthusiastic about styling.\nYou curl your hair a lot\nTo create a natural curly look, where the curls alternate direction, will take time with the Revamp since you have to manually swap over barrels to change the direction of your curls.\nYou need a hair dryer\nTo dry anything other than fine or short hair, the Revamp is likely to be found wanting; it isn't powerful enough to act as your main hair dryer.\nRevamp Dynamic Radiance 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler alternatives\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro (reviewed here) | Dyson Airwrap i.d. | Shark FlexStyle |\n|---|---|---|---|\nWeight w/ no attachments: | Confirming | 0.6 kg | Confirming |\nSize w/ no attachments: | 11.7in / 29.7cm (L); 1.7in / 4.4cm (D) | 10.7in / 27.2cm (L); 1.9in / 4.8cm (D) | 11.3in / 28.7cm (L); 1.7in / 4.4cm (D) |\nWattage: | 1,300W | 1,300W | 1,400W |\nHeat settings: | 3 + cool shot | 3 + cool shot | 3 + cool shot |\nSpeed settings: | 3 + pause | 3 | 3 |\nCord: | 3m | 2.7m | 2.4m |\nList price: | \u00a3179.99 | \u00a3479.99 | \u00a3269.99 |\nDyson Airwrap i.d.\nThe Airwrap lets you create clockwise and anticlockwise curls using the same barrel attachment. The latest version of the i.d. also arrives with a button to launch a curl sequence that cycles through curling and cooling each section of hair, and the timing is personalized to you. In addition, the attachment selection is more comprehensive, catering to different hair lengths and with the option of different bundles for different needs.\nWe're in the process of testing the Airwrap i.d. \u2013 read our Dyson Airwrap review, or see how the old and new versions differ in our Dyson Airwrap vs Airwrap i.d. feature.\nHow I tested the Revamp Dynamic Radiance 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler\nI used the Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler as my main hair styler for two weeks. I have collarbone-length, naturally wavy hair that holds curls well, but it's prone to frizz when left to do its own thing. I tested all the attachments that arrived with the styler, while also using the tool as just a hair dryer. In particular, I focused on the auto-wrap curl barrels, comparing my experience to using the Dyson Airwrap and other Airwrap alternatives.\nRead more about how we test\n- First reviewed January 2025\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "The best robot vacuum 2025: top robovacs to keep every home dust-free\nLow-effort, fuss-free robovacs to take care of your daily cleaning\nInvesting in one of the best robot vacuums can revolutionize your cleaning routine. They're perfect for taking care of regular vacuuming (and increasingly, mopping too) with next-to-no effort from you, and you can set them to run when you're out of the house, for minimal disruption.\nThe market ranges from ultra-simple to extremely capable, with price tags to match, so it's important to pick the right one for your needs. I'm here to help with that. TechRadar's testers have been reviewing robot vacuums since 2015. We've tested 75 robot vacuums in total, including 25 new models last year. I've use our in-depth reviews to compare different models and put together this ranking.\nRight now, the best robot vacuum on the market is the Eufy X10 Pro Omni. On test, this combination robot vacuum and mop was almost perfect, acing our cleaning tests and delivering accurate navigation too. However, it won't be perfect for everyone, so read on for a range of options for different needs and budgets. And if you want to supplement your robovac with a manual model for stairs and deep cleans, head to TechRadar's best cordless vacuum cleaner guide.\nRuth is a Homes Editor at TechRadar, and has been reviewing consumer tech for over three years. She's spent the past year and a half focusing on home appliances, and floor cleaners in particular.\n23 July 2025: The Roborock Qrevo Curv has been shifted to the top spot, as a result of a drop in price offering all-round better value for money. The Roborock Q7 M5 has been added as my top budget pick, and the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete as our new favorite premium bot.\nToday's best robot vacuums \u2013 as tested by experts\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best robot vacuum for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a truly autonomous robovac: This premium robot vacuum can be relied upon to take care of itself.\n\u2705 You have tall thresholds: The Curv is great at scaling tall steps, and on test it very rarely got stuck.\n\u274c You're on a budget: There are cheaper bots that'll do a good enough job for many people's needs.\n\u274c You've got lots of low furniture: The raised puck makes this a taller option in Roborock's range.\nThe best robot vacuum for most people is the Roborock Qrevo Curv. This hybrid robot vacuum-and-mop offers outstanding vacuuming, soaring through all our suction tests and proving more than a match for our reviewer's pet hair-covered carpets. Navigation is excellent and the Qrevo Curv can also be relied upon to identify and avoid obstacles as required, meaning you can leave it to do its own thing without having to worry about it getting stuck or trying to suction up something it shouldn't. On test we also found it was great at hoisting itself over tall thresholds.\nThe mopping is a cut above average, and the space-age looking curvy dock takes care of many maintenance tasks, including refilling the bot's onboard tank and washing and drying its mop pads. (You will need to supplement this with the occasional deeper clean, but that's unavoidable.)\nAn easy-to-use app offers you plenty of precise control, should you want it. Plus, you can use it for advanced functions such as a Pet Patrol mode, where you can ask the bot to find your furry friends while you're out, and even let you talk to them via the onboard mic and speaker.\nThat level of smarts means a high price tag, but because this bot has been succeeded by newer, even fancier models, deals are increasingly common these days. It's still a bit of an investment, but well worth it if you can afford it. If you're looking for a truly autonomous cleaning solution, the Roborock Qrevo Curv will deliver.\nRead our full Roborock Qrevo Curv review\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Premium price, but deals are common and it's worth the investment. | 4/5 |\nDesign | High-end design, and does-it-all dock. Plenty of features geared towards precise, hands-off cleaning. | 5/5 |\nPerformance | Exceptional vacuuming and very good mopping, plus reliable mapping and navigation. | 4.5/5 |\nAnother excellent robot vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 The Qrevo Curv is a bit too expensive: It's not quite as feature-rich as the Curv (#1), but this bot is still great and with a slightly more affordable price tag.\n\u2705 You want a strong all-rounder: The X10 Pro Omni is a very capable cleaner, offering equally strong vacuuming and mopping functions.\n\u274c You can stretch to the Qrevo Curv (#1): The Curv is all-round a better robot vacuum, so if you can afford it, it's worth the investment.\n\u274c You need something cheaper: Want something smaller and more budget-friendly? Check out the Roborock Q7 M5 (#3).\nEufy X10 Pro Omni is another strong all-rounder, and the runner up in my best robot vacuum roundup. This self-empty robot vacuum and mop checks pretty much all our boxes. The suction power is strong, pulling all kinds of debris, fluff and hair and fluff out of our tester's carpet (although it did flick larger debris about rather than sucking it up \u2013 a problem with almost all robovacs). It's relatively quiet in all but it's very highest vacuum setting, too.\nWith some 2-in-1 robovacs, the mopping is a bit of an afterthought, but the Eufy X10 Pro Omni has rotating pads that press down for a more thorough clean on hard floors. On test, it had no trouble at all cleaning a dried-on sugary drink and sticky sauce, automatically choosing the right amount of water for the job. (If you want even more impressive mopping, check out the Eureka J20 at #8, which has a roller mop that supplies continuous fresh water, and siphons off the dirty stuff as it cleans.)\nThe app is easy to use and functions well. Our reviewer was also very impressed with the mapping \u2013 the X10 accurately mapped their apartment on its first exploratory outing \u2013 as well as the navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, they did note that the Eufy X10 Pro Omni could occasionally get stuck trying to get over high room thresholds.\nThe dock station is a little on the larger side, but looks pretty stylish, and houses the water tanks and extra dustbin that allow this robovac to self-empty and (in the case of water) refill, minimizing the need for hands-on time. Overall, a capable cleaner that'll suit most people's needs.\nAlternatives\nThere are no other X10 models in the Eufy range, so you can't choose, for example, a version without mopping or with a more basic dock. There is a more advanced option: the Eufy Omni S1 Pro which adds improved obstacle avoidance, automatic detergent dispensing, and swaps the spinning mop pads for a roller that's fed by a constant supply of fresh water. It's significantly more expensive, though.\nRead our full Eufy X10 Pro Omni review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Well made and nicely designed. Robot is on the taller side. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | Impressive vacuuming and mopping, as well as strong navigation. | 4/5 |\nValue | Premium, but far from the most expensive option here, and well priced for what you're getting. | 4/5 |\nThe best budget robot vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're on a budget: This bot comes in at a low price, and offers very strong value for money.\n\u2705 You have a smaller home: The compact, charge-only dock is perfect if you're short on space or aren't dealing with tons of dust.\n\u274c You have pets: The small onboard bin will fill up quickly if you have pets \u2013 luckily, there's an Q7 M5+ version that comes with an auto-empty dock.\n\u274c Your priority is mopping: The mopping is decent here, but there are alternatives with more capable and low-effort mop setups if that's your priority.\nIf you don't have tons of cash to splash and are happy with something relatively simple, the Roborock Q7 M5 is the best budget robot vacuum I've tested. For a very affordable price (with further discounts cropping up regularly) it delivers capable cleaning \u2013 including the kind of suction specs I'd expect to see on a much pricier bot.\nIt performed well in my vacuuming tests, sucking up debris large and small, and tackling pet hair with enthusiasm too. Its mapping and navigation are accurate and it meticulously trundled over the entire floor space. However, it wasn't amazing at cleaning right up to the edges of rooms \u2013 fancier robovacs have extending side brushes for this, whereas the Q7 M5's is fixed.\nThe mop setup is very acceptable, if a little on the wet side. I was pleasantly surprised with how effectively it cleared a dried ketchup smear in my tests. You can switch the mopping on and off without having to remove the whole mop pad (as is the case on some budget robovacs), but do note that the Q7 M5 can't lift its mop when traversing carpet.\nOverall the build quality felt very robust. I especially liked the generously sized dust cup and water tank, and the big, bouncy wheels that help it tackle uneven flooring and taller room thresholds. I tested the regular Q7 M5, which has a compact, charge-only dock that's ideal if you have a smaller home with no space for a bulky dock.\nHowever, those dealing with higher levels of dust or pet hair should consider the Q7 M5+, which comes with an auto-empty dock, or even the Q7 M5 Max+, which can auto-empty dust and refill the water tank. Naturally, each is a little pricier than the last, but they're all affordable and strong value for money.\nAlternatives\nThere are a few solid options in the budget price bracket. The Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 is similarly priced and offers equally solid performance, although the water tank is smaller and the mop setup slightly more fiddly. Another excellent budget robot vacuum for UK shoppers is the Xiaomi X20+ (#9).\nRead our full Roborock Q7 M5 review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Basic but effective. A robust bot with bouncy suspension and large onboard bin and water tank. | 3.5/5 |\nPerformance | Very strong suction for the price, plus reliable mapping and navigation. Mopping basic but fine. | 4/5 |\nValue | Sits in the budget bracket and regularly discounted further. Great value. | 4/5 |\nThe best robot vacuum for pet hair\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have pets: This bot tackled the hair in our reviewer's pet-filled home incredibly well \u2013 and better than any other robovac they'd tested.\n\u2705 You have lots of carpet: There's plenty of suction to pull dust from fibers, and this bot will raise or drop off its mop pads so you avoid damp carpets.\n\u274c You just need something simple: There are simpler options that cost less if you don't need all those features.\n\u274c You're short on space: The dock is pretty massive, and the styling won't be to everyone's taste.\nIf you have shedding pets, especially combined with a decent amount of carpet, the Dreame L40 Ultra will be the best robot vacuum for you. This bot was put through its paces in a home filled with furry, four-legged friends, and really rose to the challenge. The impressive suction pulled huge volumes of hair from carpet, and handled hard floors extremely well too. We had no issues with the hair clogging the self-empty mechanism, and a larger-than-usual dock dustbin means you won't need to replace the dust bags too frequently.\nThe mopping is also a cut above average. On test, we found the rotating pads very effective \u2013 great news if you're regularly dealing with muddy pawprints. The robot will leave its mop pads in its dock when they're not needed, or raise them when moving off hard floor to help you avoid damp carpets, too.\nThe does-it-all dock will take care of emptying the bot's dustbin, refilling its water tank, dispensing cleaning fluid, and cleaning and drying its mop pads, meaning minimal hands-on time from you. Operating this robovac is nice and straightforward too. My tester found the app easy to use, with useful customization options. Mapping is fast and accurate, and object avoidance solid, too.\nThis isn't a cheap bot, but it regularly attracts hefty discounts now that Dreame has brought out fancier, newer models. If you want to see how it compares to other pet-friendly options, head to our general roundup of the best robot vacuums for pet hair.\nRead our full Dreame L40 Ultra review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | A well-designed hybrid robovac with features for tackling edges. Dock does is comprehensive, but is bulky. | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | Impressive vacuuming and mopping, and outstanding at handling pet hair in particular. | 5/5 |\nValue | Premium, but regularly attracts big discounts that deliver excellent value for money. Worth the investment. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best small robot vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don't have much space: The SwitchBot is very tiny, and can get into tight spaces that others can't. The dock is also compact for a self-empty option.\n\u2705 You want a self-empty bot: The dock has a large dust bag, and self-empties \u2013 if you don't need that, charge-only docks are much smaller.\n\u274c You want something that mops well: The mopping here is just dragging a wet wipe across the floor, and not worth bothering with.\n\u274c You have space for a bigger robovac: You're paying a premium for the size here \u2013 there are bigger, better-performing bots in this bracket.\nIf you're looking specifically for a small robot vacuum, our top pick is the SwitchBot K10+ Pro. The bot itself is very compact, measuring 9.8in / 24.8cm in diameter and 3.6in / 9.2cm in height. That pint-sized design packs in some impressive tech, including intelligent room-mapping and some of the speediest navigation our tester had ever seen. The benefit of the dinky size is that this bot can reach places bigger bots can't, and on test we found it navigated confidently around furniture legs and into tight spaces.\nThe dock is also very compact for a self-empty model. The interior space is mostly given over to a larger-than-normal dust bag, which means you won't be bothered by the tiny onboard bin. (It's worth highlighting that if you don't need self-emptying, charge-only docks are considerably smaller again.)\nThere are some downsides, though. The suction power is low for the price bracket \u2013 in fact, generally, you're paying a premium for the small size here. The mopping is also so basic as to be not really worth bothering with; the robovac just drags a wet wipe across your floor. On test it also sometimes struggled to clear thresholds of over 2cm.\nIf your priority is size, though, this is a solid choice. Our reviewer felt it would be a great choice as an 'upstairs' robot vacuum, away from the tougher challenges of kitchens and living rooms.\nAlternatives\nIf you just want something that's shallow in profile for getting beneath furniture, look for a robovac without a raised central puck. This puck is generally used for robot vacuum navigation, but there are options that use different approaches \u2013 including all Roomba models, and some of Roborock's newest bots like the Qrevo Slim and Roborock Saros 10R (both of which we rate very highly).\nRead our full SwitchBot K10+ Pro review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Fantastically compact and great for getting into tight spot. Self-empty dock also small. | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | Navigates confidently into tight spaces, but suction is on the weaker side and mopping is poor. | 3.5/5 |\nValue | Not wildly overpriced, but you're paying more for the compact size. | 3.5/5 |\nThe best premium robot vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a gadget nerd: This bot is packed with hi-tech features, including little legs and a retractible navigation puck.\n\u2705 You have tall room thresholds: The X50 can hoist itself over thresholds up to 2.4in / 6cm in height.\n\u274c You're on a budget: This is one of the most expensive robovacs on the market, and it's new enough that discounts are rare.\n\u274c You don't need the special features: There are plenty of robovacs that are still extremely impressive but lack the fancy features of the X50.\nIf you're a fan of a hi-tech gadget (or you just want something that's excellent at cleaning and reach places other robots can't) the check out the Dreame X50 Ultra Complete. This bot has a range of cool features, including tiny legs that raise it up to propel it over tall thresholds, and a navigation puck that can retract until it's flush to the robot's top surface. That means it can reach rooms that might have been off-limits to other bots, and clean in low-height spaces like under the sofa.\nA handful of other premium robot vacuums offer similar features, but this Dreame bot offers perhaps the most complete package on the market right now, and it's bolstered by excellent cleaning performance too. On test, it offered thorough vacuuming and an superb mopping, and our tester was especially impressed with how well it cleaned the edges of rooms (an extending side brush and mop pad are to thank for this).\nThe dock is the does-it-all type that does everything from emptying dust to refilling the water tanks, as well as cleaning the mop pads with hot water. There's even UV light treatment to keep everything extra-hygienic.\nAll that tech comes at a price, and this bot will be out of many people's budgets. It's also relatively new to the market, having gone on sale in spring 2025; that means discounts are rare, but I expect they will start to crop up before too long.\nAlternatives\nIf you're in the mood for some flashy, cutting-edge tech, you'll also want to check out the Roborock Saros Z70. It doesn't have feet, but it does have a robotic arm that'll clear away your socks for you.\nAlternatively, if it's the retracting puck tech that's caught your eye, check out the Roborock Saros 10 (#7), which has the same thing. In Dreame's own range, the L40 Ultra (#4) is a very impressive performer, although it lacks the bells and whistles of the X50.\nRead our full Dreame X50 Ultra Complete review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | A fully-featured hybrid robot vacuum decked out with cutting-edge special features. | 5/5 |\nPerformance | Excellent cleaning and particularly great at edges. Battery drains a little quickly though. | 4.5/5 |\nValue | One of the priciest bots around, somewhat justified by the tech and features. Perhaps wait for a deal, though. | 4/5 |\nThe best robot vacuum for carpet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have a lot of carpet: This bot has the highest suction of any model here, and it proved excellent at pulling dust from carpet fibers.\n\u2705 You want a stylish dock: Okay, it's not the most important thing, but the Saros 10 has the best looking dock I've seen.\n\u274c Your priority is mopping: The D-shaped mop here is very good, but the rotating disc style pads tend to offer more of a scrub.\n\u274c You have especially tall room thresholds: While the Saros 10 can clear step-ups of up to 4cm, but the Dreame X50 (#6) can manage 6cm thanks to its tiny stilts.\nThe Roborock Saros 10 is the best robot vacuum for cleaning lots of carpet, thanks to incredible suction specs and a well-designed roller to gently agitate the fibers (without getting tangled with hair). It also offers strong mopping, and has the ability to raise or drop off mop pads in the dock when they're not needed, so your carpets won't get damp.\nIt's one of two robot vacuums in this guide (alongside the Dreame at #6) to have a LiDAR puck that can retract to clean in limited-height spaces. That sounds like a minor thing, but if it's the difference between the bot being able to get into the dusty depths beneath your sofa, and just skirting around its perimeter, it's well worth it. It can also make its way over tall room thresholds, although not quite as tall as the ones the Dreame can.\nThis bot sailed through my vacuuming tests and also had no trouble pulling large volumes of dog hair from carpeted floors \u2013 and then emptying it into the dock without causing a jam. In fact, it's a strong recommendation for pet-owners in general.\nElsewhere the mopping is solid, and an especially good choice if you have floors that are sensitive to moisture but still need an occasional damp clean, because you have fine control over water levels and the lowest settings are really very light. An extra mini side mop helps with cleaning right up to the edges of rooms. However, if you're looking for a deeper scrub, I'd seek out a bot with dual rotating mop pads rather than the fixed, D-shaped one found here.\nAs well as looking extremely stylish when compared to the wider market, the dock here is comprehensive and will take care of a lot of maintenance tasks for you. It can charge the bot in double-quick time, as well as emptying dust, dispensing detergent, washing the mops with hot water, and drying them with warm air.\nPrice-wise the Saros 10 is premium, but worth it for the quality, features and performance. As newer Roborocks come out (as they will before long; this brand has a very speedy launch rate), I expect to see strong discounts, too.\nAlternatives\nThis bot has a sister model: the Roborock Saros 10R. It's similar and priced the same, but with a few key differences \u2013 mainly that the 10R doesn't have a puck at all (it uses a different navigation tech that means it's unnecessary). See exactly how the two compare in our Roborock Saros 10 vs 10R face-off.\nRead our full Roborock Saros 10 review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | A feature-filled hybrid robovac with retractible LiDAR puck, extra mini side mop and a comprehensive clean station dock (which is also super stylish). | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | Excellent vacuuming, very good mopping and lots of control. Reliable navigation but patchy obstacle avoidance. | 4/5 |\nValue | Premium but in line with other brands' range-toppers, and worth it for the quality and features. Might be worth waiting for a discount, though. | 4/5 |\nThe best robot vacuum for hard floors\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Your priority is mopping: The star of the show here is the innovative and effective roller mop, which continuously siphons dirty water off the mop pad and adds fresh water as it cleans.\n\u2705 You want a hands-off option: The dock takes care of a lot of mop maintenance, including emptying and refilling tanks, and cleaning the mop pads.\n\u274c You don't need the very best mopping: The advanced mopping and comprehensive dock bump up the price here, and other robovacs will do a good enough mopping job for most people (the Eufy X10 at #1 has a great mop, for example).\n\u274c You're short on space: The dock can do a lot of things, but it's pretty bulky as a result.\nThe Eureka J20 is the best robot vacuum for hard floors, thanks to a game-changing new 'RollRenew' mop style. With most robovacs, mopping is a bit of an afterthought, but that's not the case here. The mop pad is mounted onto a roller (think: tank track), and as it rotates around the dirty liquid is siphoned off and clean water is sprayed on. That helps ensure a hygienic and effective mopping session \u2013 the mop won't simply spread messes around further as it tries to clean them.\nOn test, we found it did a fantastic job of clearing spillages. We were also impressed with the comprehensive docking station, which helps ease the burden of the maintenance tasks involved with mopping robot vacuums. It'll drain the dirty water tank, refill the clean one, and wash and dry the mop pads. Elsewhere, vacuuming is very good, especially on higher suction levels, and the mapping and obstacle avoidance reliable too.\nOn the down-side, the battery life is rather short on higher powered modes (which will be required for most people's needs). That might not be an issue if you're cleaning on one floor as the bot will just return to its dock to recharge as required, but it becomes more annoying if you're using it on multiple floors.\nPrice-wise, it's not cheap \u2013 although we couldn't fault the build quality or engineering, and these kinds of do-it-all docks do always come at a price. But if you have lots of hard floors and mopping is your priority, it's worth the investment.\nAlternatives\nPreviously in this slot we had the Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni, which offers hot water mopping that's great at tackling greasy spillages. There are some compromises you'll need to make with this model, but it's often on sale and significantly cheaper than this Eureka model. Another alternative to consider is the Eufy Omni S1 Pro, which we found absolutely excellent for mopping.\nRead our full Eureka J20 robot vacuum review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | High build quality, innovative mop design, and well-engineered base station that takes care of most maintenance. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | Excellent mopping, and strong vacuuming too \u2013 especially on higher settings. Battery life short though. | 4.5/5 |\nValue | Premium, but there are very few alternatives with this roller mop system. Price bumped up by the does-it-all dock. | 4/5 |\nThe best budget robot vacuum in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're on a budget: The X20+ sits in the budget price bracket, and delivers an awful lot for that very affordable price.\n\u2705 You have hard floor to mop: With dual spinning mop pads and a dock that can clean and dry them, this bot shines when it comes to hard floors.\n\u274c You're short on space: The dock is large and unattractive, so you'll want somewhere out of the way to store it.\n\u274c You live in the US: The X20+ can be found in the US, but it's more expensive. Check out the Roborock at #3 instead.\nBargain-hunting shoppers in the UK should seek out the Xiaomi X20+. As well as solid suction specs and excellent cleaning powers, you're getting a whole raft of features that you just never see at this budget price point.\nFor starters, there are dual spinning mop pads rather than the single, fixed pad that's more common on cheaper robovacs. This style of mop tends to be far more effective at agitating dirt, and we were impressed with this bot's mopping powers in our testing. The pads will also automatically lift when they reach carpet, too (although they fail to identify some of our tester's very thin rugs).\nOn the mopping front, the dock will take care of a lot of the required maintenance for you; refilling the water tank and washing and drying the mop pads. You'll usually need to shell out a lot more for such a comprehensive clean station... although do note that it's large and not so attractive, so you'll want to make sure you have somewhere out-of-the-way to store it.\nSome budget robovacs can fall down when it comes to navigation, but not so the X20+, which found its way around our reviewer's home with ease and confidence.\nAlternatives\nIf you live in the US or don't want a bulky dock, check out the Roborock at #3. This robovac comes with a compact, charge-only dock that can fit \u2013 for example \u2013 neatly under a bed. The suction levels are higher than the X20's, but you'll need to take care of all maintenance yourself. I also rate the Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 in a similar vein.\nRead our full Xiaomi X20+ review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Well-designed bot with dual mop pads, plus comprehensive but bulky and ugly base station. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | Excellent navigation, very good vacuuming and mopping. | 4.5/5 |\nValue | Budget bracket, and offers features more common in premium bots. | 5/5 |\nThe best all-in-one robot vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You also need a manual vacuum: Most people with robovacs also have a manual vacuum. The Ecovacs takes the fuss of that out by providing you with one in the first place.\n\u2705 You love a high-tech gadget: With its own voice assistant, fantastic mapping and (albeit unreliable) foot control, this is one clever robot vacuum.\n\u274c Your priority is mopping: The mopping here is very good, but probably not as good as the Eufy at #1 or Eureka at #7.\n\u274c You're on a budget: The Deebot T30S Combo is one of the more expensive robot vacuums in my guide, and if you're willing to make a few compromises on performance or features then there are plenty more affordable alternatives.\nThe Ecovacs Deebot T30S Combo is the best all-in-one robot vacuum solution. It has the highest maximum suction of any robot vacuum in this ranking (11,000Pa \u2013 matching the maximum we see on any robot vacuum). The specs stood up on testing too; this robovac's vacuuming powers are some of the very best we've come across. Our tester also found it could tackle the edges of rooms remarkably well, and its mopping is excellent too.\nMost people with robot vacuums need to supplement them with a manual vacuum \u2013 even if your robovac is great at corners and edges, it still won't be able to tackle stairs or upholstery. Ecovacs has taken the effort out of that by bundling a mini handheld vacuum in with the T30S Combo (and if you get the Complete version, there's a full stick vacuum thrown in!) for supplementary cleaning. At 3L, the onboard dustbin capacity is larger than usual, meaning it you'll need to replace the bags less often.\nAs you'd expect at this price, this robot vacuum not short on features, including its own voice assistant. It can launched via the tap of a foot (although on test this didn't always work reliably), the base station will wash and dry the mop pads, the dust cups of the robovac and the handheld vac will auto-empty when docked, and the mapping is outstanding. The companion app works extremely well \u2013 our tester was especially impressed that it automatically partitioned the rooms into their own spaces. In terms of performance, we had almost no issues with this robot vacuum at all \u2013 if it's in your budget, it's worth the investment.\nRead our full Ecovacs Deebot T30S Combo review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Comes with a supplementary handheld vacuum.

Meet some of the expert reviewers who tested the robovacs that feature in this guide.\nJames has tested robot vacuums of all sorts from the most basic models to the ones so feature-packed that they can be used as a security camera. He appreciates models that can suck up all sorts of debris, clean the edges of rooms, and allow easy room partitioning in-app. So far he has reviewed 9 robot vacuums for TechRadar, including models by Narwal, Ecovacs, Yeedi, Bissell and Shark.\nAlistair is a London-based journalist who has been writing about tech for over a decade. He has tested numerous robovacs over the years for TechRadar, from brands like iRobot, Eufy and Roborock. His favourites match intelligent navigation with smart design.\nAlternatives to consider\nIf none of the robot vacuums above take your fancy, here are some other models worth considering. These robovacs all scored highly on test, but just didn't quite make our main guide.\nEcovacs Deebot T20 Omni\nThis bot was previously our top pick for hard floors, thanks to hot water mopping that's more than a match for greasy spillages.

I only used manual vacuums before I started testing robot vacuums for TechRadar, and now I wouldn't be without one. They have revolutionized my cleaning \u2013 I live alone, so I'm not dealing with loads of dirt and dust buildup, but I send the robot out once or twice a week and it just takes care of the vacuuming for me. It's realistically far more often than I would drag a manual vac out of the cupboard, so my apartment is cleaner than usual, and my dust allergy symptoms have calmed down too.\nA 2024 study from Roskilde University in Denmark explored how householders\u2019 experiences with robot vacuum cleaners compared to their experience with manual vacuum, and found that \"robotic vacuum cleaners are inferior in use, yet transform vacuuming\". That's exactly in line with my personal experience \u2013 while I can see that my robot vacuum's cleaning power is not as strong as a manual vac, the fact that it allows for regular, basically effort-free vacuuming means it has still had a massive positive impact on my cleaning routine.\nRobot vacuums can be expensive, but you don't have to shell out for a top-of-the-range model \u2013 for many people, even a basic, affordable option will make a big difference.\nThere are caveats, though. Robovacs can't deal with stairs, so their usefulness in multi-floor homes is far more limited. They're also not capable of proper deep cleans, so if you're dealing with lots of hair or dirt, they might not cut it.\nHow much does a robot vacuum cost?\nPricing for robot vacuums can vary enormously. At TechRadar, these are the price bands we use:\nBudget: less than $500 / \u00a3400\nMid-range: $400-$800 / \u00a3400-\u00a3650\nPremium: $800+ / \u00a3650+\nBroadly speaking, the more functions are included, the higher the price tag. Adding things like mopping, self-emptying, and self-cleaning will all result in a much higher price tag. So if you just want a capable robot vacuum and are happy to empty it yourself, you'll be able to shop mostly in the budget and lower mid-range brackets.\nIt's not rare these days to see range-topping models run to four figures, but the rate of meaningful improvement has started to slow, and for many people, the features included in those models are far from essential. Big-brand robovacs that are a couple of years old can often deliver the best value for money, with very few sacrifices in performance. And sales events like the Black Friday deals generally come through with strong discounts in this category too.\nDo robot vacuums work on pet hair?\nYes, but with caveats. Generally, robot vacuums can't match manual models for outright suction power, so they won't clean built-up pet hair and dander as thoroughly as, say, a corded upright. That's especially true if you're dealing with carpet. Robot vacs are best suited to convenient, little-and-often cleans, so if you send yours out daily, it'll help you stay on top of your pet's hair and stop it from building up in the first place. You'll likely still want to supplement this with the occasional deep clean with a manual vacuum, though.\nIf you have shedding pets and carpet, look for models with higher suction power (6,000Pa or ideally more), and a boost/extra suction mode option. Models with rubbery brushrolls are also typically good at gripping hair.\nCan a robot vacuum replace a normal vacuum?\nRealistically, probably not. For one, you can't use them anywhere but on the floor, so you'll need something to clean your stairs, furniture, mattress and so on. They also can't really match manual vacuums for suction power, so while they can help you stay on top of dust build-up, most people will want to supplement their work with the occasional deep clean with a manual vacuum.\nRead more on this subject in our article exploring can a robot vacuum replace your existing vacuum cleaner?\nHow do robot vacuums work?\nRobot vacuums have a series of brushes on the underside of the machine that work together to collect dirt and dust that they come in contact with. The dirt is then sucked into the dust cup, which is fitted into the vacuum's body. Most are equipped with smaller brushes that extend past the circumference of the vacuum, and the purpose of these is to reach dirt that's settled against baseboards or in awkward places.\nMore advanced robot vacuums have lasers on the front of the machine and some on the underside of the device too. These lasers detect where furniture, objects, and edges are in your home, helping avoid bumps, and cliff detection prevents the machine from falling down the stairs. Read our article on how do robot vacuums work to find out more.\nWhat is the best robot vacuum?\nAfter reviewing 25 new robot vacuums on TechRadar over the course of 2024, and at least a dozen more this year so far, the best robot vacuum on the market right now is the Roborock Qrevo Curv. It used to be that this bot was my premium pick, but widely available price-drops have pushed it up into the overall top spot.\nRoborock is a reliably excellent robot vacuum brand, and the Curv boasts some seriously impressive specs (but lacks the kind of unnecessary extras that might push the price up). It delivers superb suction and excellent mopping, is dreamily straightforward and reliable in use, and comes with a dock will take care of plenty of maintenance task for you.\nHow to choose the best robot vacuum for you\nNew robot vacuums are being released at an alarming rate, and it can be difficult to tell one from another. Below is my quick guide to how to choose the right model for you \u2013 if you want more information, you'll find it in my in-depth robot vacuum buying advice article.\nSuction power\nUp to the start of 2025, the highest suction level you'd see on a robot vacuum would be around 10,000Pa (which will be ample for most people's need). However, today's top-specced bots can generate upwards of 18,000Pa. In the mid-range price bracket today, expect 6,000-9,000Pa of suction. Lower than 6,000Pa is what I'd expect in a budget-friendly model.\nRespected robovac brand Eufy says on its blog that 2,000-6,000Pa is \"adequate for routine maintenance cleaning\". That figure is a little outdated, and you can expect more suction for your money nowadays. If you're dealing with things like pet hair and/or carpets, I'd definitely be looking at a bot that has 6,000Pa plus.\nRemember that in general robot vacuums are designed for regular, light cleaning rather than deep cleans.\nVac or mop-vac?\nMany of today's best robot vacuums are also able to mop floors. This can be useful if you have a mix of hard floors and carpet, but be aware that robovac mopping tends not to clean as well as good old manual mopping. Dual, rotating circular disc mop pads tend to deliver a more effective clean than semicircular mop pads, in my experience.\n\u25bc\nDock type\nThe cheapest robovacs will only have a dock for charging. Pricier models incorporate self-emptying of the onboard dustbin, and draining/refilling of the onboard water tanks. The very fanciest models offer automatic mop pad cleaning, and detergent dispensing for the mopping fluid. Onboard dustbins tend to be small, so if you're dealing with lots of dust or hair then I'd recommend prioritizing a self-empty dock. However, be aware that the more functions you add, the bigger the dock will be \u2013 the ones with water tanks can be pretty massive.\nCleaning features\nBeyond suction power, there are lots of design aspects that will affect how well your robovac cleans, including edge cleaning features, pet-friendly features, and features geared towards tackling hair.\nHistorically, robovacs aren't great at cleaning up to the edges of rooms, but today's best robot vacuums add spinning side brushes designed to flick debris into the robot's suction path. Combo models might also have mops that can kick out from the side of the vacuum to get closer to the sides of rooms.\nPet owners might want to look for a model that is able to recognize their pet and either avoid it (if it's spooked by the addition of a sentient appliance to the household) or seek it out to check up on it while you're out of the house. If your pet occasionally makes a mess on the carpet, look for models that are designed to recognize and avoid poop.\nIf you have long hair, or live with someone who does, you might want to consider a robot vacuum with features geared towards ensuring it doesn't end up tangled all around the brushrolls. Some brands will address this by tapering their brushrolls or breaking them in the middle, with the aim of quickly directing hair towards the bin inlet. Dreame even has an alternative brushroll attachment that has little blades to chop up hair so it can be more easily managed.\nHow we tested these robot vacuums\n\u2705 We've tested over 75 robot vacuums in total\n\u2705 ... including 25 new models in 2024\n\u2705 We've been reviewing robovacs since 2015\nA new robot vacuum can be a significant investment, so to ensure you end up with the right one for you, each model here has been tested either on-team, or by one of our regular, experienced freelance reviewers.\nWe test out models from a wide range of brands, including the likes of iRobot Roomba, Shark and Roborock, as well as Eufy, Ecovacs, Narwal and Proscenic. We cover options for different budgets, rather than only testing the latest-and-greatest models (which, after all, will be overkill for many shoppers).\nOur reviews are underpinned by specific, standardized tests. Here's a rundown of our review process.\nSuction tests\nWe test fine dirt pickup by sprinkling a mix of flour and cookie crumbs on the floor, and large debris pickup using oats. We look at whether there's any remnants left after a single pass from the robot vacuum, and if it catches them on a second run. We repeat these tests for both hard floor and carpet.\nMopping tests\nIf the robot vacuum has a mop function, we see how it copes with fresh liquid spillages as well as dried-on, sticky messes. We'll also look at how the robot tackles the issue of switching between vacuuming and mopping \u2013 will it reliably detect floor type, and pick up its mop pad when moving from hard floor onto carpet, for example?\nMapping tests\nWhen we first get the robot set up, we'll see how long it takes to create a map of the home, and how accurate that map is. For subsequent runs, we'll keep an eye on how the robot navigates the space; if takes a logical route through the house, if it repeats already-clean areas, and so on.\nNavigation tests\nTo assess object avoidance, we lay out a charge cable, a sock that's a similar color to the floor, and some fake pet poop, to see if it can reliably spot and avoid them. On the navigation front, we'll also test the robot vacuum's edge cleaning abilities \u2013 does it get right up to the edges of rooms, or leave a margin that needs manual cleaning.\nGeneral use tests\nAs well as these standardized tests, my reviewers integrate these robovacs into their daily cleaning setup, to get a feel for how effective and user-friendly they are in general. This includes assessing noise levels (when cleaning and also when self-emptying), how long they last on a single charge, and how regularly they have to return to the dock to self-empty or charge.\nWe'll dig into the app and gauge how well-designed, usable and intuitive it is, and how much control it offers. We'll also test any specific performance claims made by the manufacturer, as well as checking out any special features like built-in voice assistants and camera surveillance.\nAfter at least two weeks of testing, we consolidate our findings and use them to judge who (if anyone) we'd recommend the robot vacuum to. We also compare the features and build quality to the price, to assess if the robot vacuum is good value for money.\nRead more on how we test vacuum cleaners.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nHaving already revolutionized hair dryers and multi-stylers, Dyson has set its sights on straightening with its latest haircare creation, the Dyson Airstrait. With the power of air, the Airstrait dries and straightens hair at the same time, potentially slashing your haircare routine by half and reducing the heat damage caused by traditional hairdryers and straighteners. Still, it doesn't quite manage to step out of the Airwrap's looming shadow.\nPros\n- +\nKeeps hair healthy, with smooth shiny results\n- +\nImpressively quick results\n- +\nClever automatic airflow features\nCons\n- -\nFairly heavy with a clunky design\n- -\nResults aren't pin-straight\n- -\nCan't get right up to the root\n- -\nExpensive\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDyson Airstrait: two-minute review\nDyson's latest haircare innovation is here, and ready to blow you away \u2013 literally. For the uninitiated, the Dyson Airstrait uses focused airflow to tame your tresses (much like the Dyson Airwrap), protecting you from potential heat damage incurred by using a combination of traditional hair dryers and straighteners. In that sense alone, it's easily one of the best hair straighteners I've ever used, and certainly one of the best hair styler tools in general.\nDyson may historically be best known for making some of the best vacuums, but in recent years its hair- and aircare products have started appearing in TechRadar's best hair dryer and the best purifier rankings. Following the viral success of the Airwrap, the Dyson Airstrait is under a fair amount of pressure to live up to the multi-styler's legacy, and especially following the slightly lukewarm reception to the Corrale, Dyson's still-innovative but more conventional straighteners. All those efforts to master air engineering have clearly paid off; the Airstrait is pretty accomplished and a solid all-rounder, but it's got some flaws that make it far less useful for certain hair types and styling.\nUsing a precisely angled (by 45 degrees) blade of focused airflow to simultaneously dry and straighten hair, the Airstrait managed to take my thick, wavy and porous hair from wet to straight in just 10 minutes \u2013 less than half the time it would take me to dry and straighten my hair, even if I was using the Dyson Supersonic and Corrale. It's worth noting though that it's pretty hard to achieve pin-straight locks; the Airstrait created more natural-looking results, which I personally prefer.\nIt's not just for wet styling either \u2013 the Airstrait also has a dry styling mode and a cool mode to set your style, though I will say the dry styling isn't quite as effective as wet.\nAs ever, though, the Airstrait falls victim to two of Dyson's cardinal sins: being overpriced and just a little impractical on account of its size and weight. There's no doubt it offers something fairly unique in the market \u2013 barring the ghd Duet Hot Styler, that is \u2013 but I'd say if you're gearing up to spend nearly $500 / \u00a3500, you're potentially better off getting an Airwrap and using its barrel or flyaway attachment to create a similar effect, depending on your hair type.\nIt'd be remiss of me to not mention that although the Airstrait is a four-star product for me, that's largely down to my hair type. I can't speak for how it would work for coily or curly hair, for example.\nDyson Airstrait review: Price & availability\n- List price: $499.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$749\n- Launched: May 2023 (US), March 2024 (UK), June 2024 (Australia)\nIn case you missed the memo, Dyson's products are known for their high price tags, and the Airstrait is no different. At full price, it's $499.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$749 and is available directly from Dyson as well as at select third-party retailers such as Amazon.\nThe Airstrait launched in May 2023 in the US, but took nearly a full year to hit the UK, and a couple of months more to make its way Down Under, with the Airstrait available in Australia since June 25, 2024.\nNow, there's no avoiding the fact this is an incredibly costly pair of tongs. In some territories it out-prices Dyson's other hair straighteners, the Corrale ($499.99 / \u00a3399.99 / AU$699). The build quality is outstanding and there's nothing like it on the market right now. However, if you're willing to risk a little more heat damage, there are plenty of excellent traditional straighteners that come in at a more affordable price.\n- Value for money score: 3.5 out of 5\nDyson Airstrait specs\nWattage: | 1,600W |\nWeight: | 536g / 1.3lbs in hand, 935g / 2.2lbs net |\nDimensions: | 60 x 220 x 41mm / 2.4 x 8.7 x 1.6 inches (H x L x W) |\nSettings: | Dry and wet modes, 3 heat and 3 speed settings |\nCord length: | 6.6ft / 198cm |\n- Value: 3.5 out of 5\nDyson Airstrait review: Design\n- Chic, futuristic design with OLED screen\n- Monstrously large plug and broad plates\n- Fairly heavy for straighteners\nDesign-wise, the Dyson Airstrait is a real mixed bag. It's part retro, part futuristic aesthetically, resulting in a pair of tongs that look straight out of an 80s sci-fi movie in all the best ways \u2013 provided, of course, you like 80s sci-fi movies.\nFunctionally, you've still got two plates that clamp together, which plug into the wall for power (here via a 6.6ft / 198cm cable). The key difference compared to a traditional straightener is that Dyson has swapped out hot plates for unheated panels, and on the underside there are two vents \u2013 that's where the air straightening magic happens.\nA thumb-sized OLED display on the main body shows you the styling mode, airflow and temperature settings. Below this, you'll find the five button controls: hot temperature, airflow speed, cool temperature, wet/dry mode and power. To me, the OLED screen is a bit unnecessary \u2013 I'd prefer a small light indicator and a slightly lower price tag, personally.\nThere are two colorways currently available: bright nickel and prussian blue. It seems like Dyson is dropping its iconic fuschia colorway altogether, which I think is a shame. Still, I love the glossy finish and copper accents on the bright nickel model I tested.\nAt 1.18lb / 536g when held, they're pretty darn heavy for straighteners \u2013 just a touch lighter than the hefty 1.23lb / 560g Dyson Corrale. This does mean you could end up with some light arm-ache if you were using the Airstrait for a long period of time. Thankfully, the Airstrait makes pretty quick work of most hair types.\nEven the PRCD plug for the Airstrait is pretty monstrous. This bulky component might be built with safety in mind, but my goodness it's an eyesore. On the plug are test and reset buttons to offer ground fault protection, which accounts for the seriously powerful engines whirring away inside the Airstrait. Just don't expect to be able to plug them into outlets with furniture backed onto them.\n- Design score: 4 out of 5\nDyson Airstrait Review: Performance\n- Little-to-no hair snagging or sizzling\n- Instantly heats up and delivers speedy results\n- Shiny, silky hair, but not pin-straight\nOn test, I was pretty impressed with the Airstrait's performance. I have thick, wavy and porous hair, so drying it can often be a bit of a pain, especially if I don't have time to let it air-dry a little first.\nHowever, with the Airstrait, I saved time on multiple fronts. For one thing, the Airstrait can handle fairly chunky segments of hair at once, all without snagging and pulling. I was pretty dubious of this claim prior to my testing (the Corrale promised much the same but I still find it's fairly easy to snag hairs if I'm not paying attention).\nThen there's the drying itself. If you're slow and steady enough, the focused and angled blade of air generated by the Airstrait can dry a segment of my hair in just one pass, though I tend to give it a quick once over with a cool shot to set.\nIt's worth noting that because of its bulky design, the Airstrait can't get right up to the root. That's fine for my naturally wavy hair, but might be an issue for those with more defined, tighter curls.\nIts wet mode offers three temperature settings (80C / 175F, 110C / 230F, and 140C / 285F) while dry offers two (120C / 250F or 140C / 285F), and there's also a boost mode.\nThe 45-degree angled blade of focused airflow is a pretty impressive feat of engineering, in more ways than one. For one thing, it heats the segment you're straightening impressively quickly, and there wasn't once in my multiple weeks of testing that I smelled the dreaded stench of burning hair.\nPlus, thanks to the angle of the airflow, the Airstrait doesn't disrupt the rest of your hair \u2013 or your face \u2013 while straightening, keeping you cool, calm and collected throughout your beauty routine. However, you can't really curl your hair as you can with standard hot plates, and it can be quite hard to create volume, especially given the issues with reaching the root of your hair.\nIn just 10 minutes, my hair was silky, straight, and smooth, with minimal frizz and pretty impressive staying power. It's never quite perfect, but I struggle to achieve pin-straight results even with the best straighteners \u2013 plus I think a more natural straight look can be just as desirable. I did try it on dry hair, but I wasn't as impressed \u2013 it didn't seem to really do much beyond taming frizz and unmanageable flyaways.\nThe results lasted most of the day for me, keeping my hair relatively straight all the way through to the evening \u2013 but that's pretty standard for my hair type. When I tested on my partner's curlier Asian hair, I struggled to get it fully straight and noticed the results were slightly less shiny. If the styled hair got wet, damp, or encountered humidity, it became loosely curled again. This mirrors many customer experiences with curly, coily and frizzy hair \u2013 the Airstrait seems to work well, but doesn't offer the staying power of traditional hot plates.\nDyson has factored some pretty useful features into the design, too \u2013 in particular, the intuitive airflow adjustment and auto-timer. The former detects when hair is between the Airstrait's arms and adjusts the volume of airflow accordingly, and the latter cuts out the airflow when the arms have been left open for more than three seconds.\nBoth these features can come in pretty handy, not least because the Dyson Airstrait is quite loud in use, registering 72 dB at its loudest while clamped around wet hair, and 63 dB when idle. That's still very impressively quiet for a hair dryer, though, and especially one packing this much power..\nOverall, the Dyson Airstrait is a top performer for my very specific needs; it straightens wavy and slightly curly hair quickly and effectively, giving glossy and natural-looking results that by and large last the whole day. However, when used on curlier or coily hair, it's harder to achieve the same results you can with conventional straighteners.\n- Performance: 4 out of 5\nShould I buy the Dyson Airstrait?\nBuy it if...\nYou're always in a rush getting ready\nFor almost every hair type, the Airstrait offers unparalleled speed and results from wet to dry hair. For me, it cut my haircare routine by at least half.\nYou want naturally straight-looking hair\nWhile the results aren't pin-straight for me, I love the natural feel to my straightened hair when I've used the airstrait.\nYou have damaged or easily damaged hair\nBy reducing the time spent exposed to heat and cutting out hot plates altogether, the Dyson Airstrait is an excellent choice if you're worried about hair damage.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want to travel\nLike most of Dyson's haircare products (barring the Corrale straighteners), the Dyson Airstrait isn't designed to be a travel companion. When I tried using them in Europe with my UK plug and an adapter, they flat-out refused to power up.\nYou want to style your hair outside of straightening\nThe Dyson Airstrait is good at one thing and one thing only: straightening. It might be possible to figure out a convoluted curling method, but the Airwrap is a much better choice for that.\nYou need to straighten right to the root of your hair\nEspecially for curly and coily hair, it's important to be able to straighten from the root; something the Airstrait's design doesn't allow for.\nAlso consider...\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Dyson Airstrait | GHD Chronos | Dyson Corrale |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | $499.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU TBC | $329 / \u00a3289 / AU$465 | $499.99 / \u00a3399.99 / AU$544 |\nWattage | 1,600W | 150W | N/A |\nWeight | 1.3lbs / 536g in hand, 2.2lbs/ 935g net | 1.63lbs / 740g | 1.4lbs / 561g |\nDimensions (H x L x W) | 2.4 x 8.7 x 1.6in / 60 x 220 x 41mm | 11.8 x 4.6 x 2.8in / 300 x 117 x 71mm | 11.5 x 3.25 x 1.25in / 292 x 83 x 32mm |\nSettings | Dry and wet modes with 3 heat and 3 speed settings | One temperature \u2013 365F / 185C | Three temperature settings, cord-free design, flight-safe mode |\nCord length | 1.98m / 6.6ft | 2.7m / 8.11ft | 4.3m / 14.1ft |\nGHD Chronos\nThe latest premium straighteners from GHD are a good choice if you want a more premium product that will last for years to come - it\u2019s speedy, smooth and great for styling your hair.\nFor more information, check out our full GHD Chronos review.\nDyson Corrale\nIf you're dead set on a pair of Dyson straighteners, consider the Dyson Corrale.

I tested all of its modes and temperatures to gauge their effectiveness, as well as attempting different ways of using the Airstrait to style my hair.\nI also tried straightening my partner's thick, curly hair to see how performance varied between hair types. Additionally, I measured the decibel output to gauge how loud the Airstrait was in use.\nAs well as testing haircare products for the past three years, I've been hair-obsessed since childhood; I've had long hair, short hair, colored hair and natural hair, all of which I've styled (and sometimes, disastrously, cut) myself with a wide variety of tools. I've used my own professional and personal experience to inform my testing.\nFirst reviewed: April 2024\nJosephine Watson (@JosieWatson) is TechRadar's Managing Editor - Lifestyle.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 is a basic, affordable robovac that's easy to use and offers decent vacuuming, reliable navigation, and a painless set-up process. The mop is fiddly with underwhelming results, and the bot isn't great at spotting and avoiding obstacles, meaning it isn't ideal if your floors are cluttered. However, if you can cope with those compromises, this is a solid, fuss-free budget buy.\nPros\n- +\nLow price and great value\n- +\nSolid vacuuming\n- +\nGreat mapping and navigation\n- +\nCompact dock\n- +\nIntuitive app with useful controls\nCons\n- -\nUnreliable obstacle avoidance\n- -\nUnderwhelming mopping\n- -\nMop maintenance is fiddly\n- -\nRobot is on the larger side\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDreame D9 Max Gen 2: two-minute review\nThe Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 is an entry-level robot vacuum designed for those seeking cleaning convenience on a budget. While it doesn't offer the same advanced features as the best robot vacuums on the market, it's a very capable cleaner that delivers good value for money. I'd definitely count it among the best budget robovacs I've tested.\nThis hybrid robot vacuum and mop is well built, if a little on the large side, with a compact charge-only dock. Set-up is straightforward, and I was impressed by its mapping and navigation, which was quick and painless (which isn't always the case with budget bots).\nIn terms of cleaning power, the D9 Max Gen 2 performed well in suction tests, tackling fine debris or chunkier spillages without issue. I was less enamored with its mopping skills, however. The design of the mop pad isn't the best and I'm not sure it's worth the effort, delivering only the lightest wipe-down of my lino floors. Another potential downside is the unreliable object avoidance; if you often have clutter on your floors and don't want to have to tidy before every vacuuming run, this isn't the robovac for you.\nThe app is well designed and intuitive. While you won't get the kind of granular control or automation offered by pricier bots, it covers the main bases. The only exception is that I couldn't see a way to set up a cleaning schedule or time a cleaning run.\nFor the price, then \u2013 which is solidly in the budget bracket \u2013 I think the D9 Max Gen 2 is a good buy. Dreame makes some of our favorite premium robot vacuums (including the excellent Dreame L40 Ultra), so I'm not surprised to find that its budget offering is of a high quality. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a wallet-friendly, fuss-free robovac that navigates reliably well and helps you stay on top of your vacuuming. That's the short version; read on for my full Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 robot vacuum review.\nDreame D9 Max Gen 2 review: price & availability\n- List price: $299.99 / \u00a3219 / AU$699\n- Launched: Confirming\n- Available: US, UK, Australia\nIn the US, at time of writing, the Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 is available direct from Dreame US or via Amazon, and has a list price of $299.99. In the UK, it has a list price of \u00a3219, and is available to buy direct from Dreame UK, as well as a range of third-party retailers such as Amazon, B&Q and Currys. In Australia, the robovac costs AU$699 at full price, but can be found discounted to AU$399 on the Dreame AU site at the time of writing. Note that I spotted the vacuum being offered at big discounts in all territories while writing this review.\nEven at list price, this bot is firmly in the budget price bracket \u2013 we count any robot vacuum under $500 / \u00a3400 as budget at TechRadar. For that price, it feels very well-built, and the features are in line with what I'd expect.\n- Value for money score: 4 out of 5\nDreame D9 Max Gen 2 specs\nMax suction: | 6000Pa |\nRobot diameter: | 13.8in / 35cm |\nRobot height: | 3.8in / 9.6cm |\nDock dimensions (W x D x H): | 5.3 x 5.4 x 3.7in / 13.4 x 13.8 x 9.4cm |\nDust bin volume (onboard): | 0.6 L |\nDust bin volume (base): | None |\nWater tank volume: | 0.2 L |\nBase type: | Charge only |\nNavigation: | LiDAR |\nCharge time: | 6 hours |\nMax runtime: | 4 hrs 45 mins |\nDreame D9 Max Gen 2 review: design\n- Hybrid robovac and mop with compact, charge-only dock\n- Single rubber roller and one side brush\n- Fixed, D-shaped mop pad with small integrated water tank\nThe Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 is a hybrid robotic vacuum and mop. It's sports the standard, round design with a raised navigation puck, and is available in black or white. Size-wise, it's at the larger end of the spectrum, measuring 13.8in / 35cm in diameter, and it features two physical buttons: Power and Home. However, for most controls you'll want to use the companion app.\nThis model uses LiDAR for navigation, hence the raised puck. This is the fastest and most accurate robot vacuum navigation technology, and widely used \u2013 but not always a given in budget-friendly models (some use the more basic vSLAM; see how the two compare in our LiDAR vs vSLAM explainer). There's also a camera at the front of the bot.\nFlip it over and you'll find a single rotating side brush, a rubbery roller, two chunky wheels, and a smaller, third mini-wheel for balance. In general, I prefer rubbery rollers such as the one here over bristled brushrolls, since the latter tend to become tangled with hair. Some bots will have dual rollers (the main examples being Roborock and iRobot Roomba models); but in general, this looks like a pretty standard setup.\nSlightly more unusual is the approach to the mop pad. Dreame has integrated a wide, very shallow water tank onto the underside of the D-shaped mop pad. Other robovacs will have a separate tank inside the bot itself, but that uses up valuable dust-storing space. Here, you're getting a slightly higher onboard dust cup capacity, but the bot won't hold much water.\nThe mop pad/water tank comes on and off using a combination of clips and magnets (not as complicated as it sounds!), so it doesn't need to be attached when you're just vacuuming.\nThis kind of fixed, D-shaped mop pad tends not to be as effective at scrubbing compared to the spinning, dual discs found on more advanced models. However, it's as I'd expect for a robot vacuum in this price bracket.\nThe mop pad also can't lift and lower to allow the bot to traverse over carpet without leaving damp patches, which is a feature also seen on pricier robot vacuums. In fact, more advanced Dreame bots can dock themselves and drop off their mop pads when they're not required \u2013 but again, you'd need to pay a fair bit more for that kind of functionality.\nA hinged lid on top of the bot can be opened to reveal the onboard dust cup with integrated filter. This is very slightly fiddly to remove from the inside of the bot. There's also a brush and hair-cutter tool, for easier maintenance.\nThe dock is of the basic, charge-only type, rather than the kind that houses a larger dustbin into which the bot's smaller bin will automatically empty. That has the benefit of being far more compact \u2013 good news, if you have a small home. However, it also means you'll need to take care of emptying the bin manually, which will be annoying if you're regularly dealing with large volumes of dust or pet hair, for instance.\nYou'll also need to manually refill the bot's water tank, as well as clean and dry the mop pads. For a dock that can do this for you, you'd be looking in a significantly higher price bracket.\n- Design score: 3.5 out of 5\nDreame D9 Max Gen 2 review: performance\n- Good navigation, but unreliable object avoidance\n- Vacuuming generally good, can struggle with larger debris\n- Mopping okay, but just for very light cleans\nThe app walked me through the initial setup, which included linking the bot to my home Wi-Fi and connecting it to the app \u2013 all nice and straightforward.\nOn setup, it prompted me to do a fast mapping run, where the bot just creates a map of your space but doesn't clean. This took under five mins, and involved the bot meandering into each room and vaguely looking around. After that was complete, it created a very rough map of the space, without trying to separate rooms.\nI then set it off on its first cleaning run. I was pretty impressed. The bot covered everything with minimal fuss, only getting slightly muddled when trying to traverse the slanting edges of some rooms. It also became stuck when it was making its way around the border of my low hearth \u2013 although did manage to escape on its own eventually.\nWith the first cleaning run complete, the app split the map into what it thought were rooms (mostly correct), and I tweaked and named each room. It is possible to create multiple maps, but I didn't do this as I live on a single floor.\nNavigation & obstacle avoidance\nIn general, the Dreame Max Gen 2 navigates very well. I could see it adjusting its path when it was about to reach an obstruction, although at times it did also seem to find its way by bumping into things.\nHowever, it isn't as reliable when it comes to obstacle avoidance. I ran TechRadar's standard tests using a shoe, sock and cable on my floor, and the Dreame failed to spot any of them, eating the cable, doing its best to eat the sock, and pushing the shoe around until I picked it up and took it away to safety. This bot probably isn't the best choice if you have a lot of clutter on your floors.\nSuction performance\nThe Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 has four suction modes: Quiet, Standard, Strong and Turbo; and can be set to vacuum, mop, or both.\nTo assess cleaning power, I ran TechRadar's standard tests. I started by sprinkling tea and oats on separate patches of carpet. I bumped up the suction setting to Strong (it's Standard by default) and set the bot to vacuum that area.\nIt cleared most of the tea in one pass, and almost all of it in two. I then boosted suction up to Max, and remote-controlled the bot over the area to clear the final remnants.\nI was impressed with how it handled the oat spillage, too. It cleared almost all of it first time and the rest on second pass, and it didn't ping them around, either.\nHowever, in my general use of the vacuum on carpet, I had a few minor complaints. Occasionally, the bot would deposit larger debris \u2013 a tiny bit of leaf, for example \u2013 in another area of the room after initially seeming to have picked it up.\nI also found it wasn't amazing at dealing with hair. I have long hair, and the bot would occasionally to roll it into clumps and leave it on the carpet rather than pick it up. However, there was hair in the bin when I came to empty it, and none wrapped around the brushroll, so it isn't a total fail on that front. (If you're looking for the best vacuum for pet hair, we have a separate guide that's worth consulting.)\nI repeated my tea suction test on hard floor. On the first pass, the D9 Max Gen 2 seemed to just push the tea leaves around everywhere. On the second and third passes, though, it had gathered pretty much everything.\nThe oats were pinged around even more enthusiastically, however; but, again, almost all were sucked up eventually. Only a few escaped and that was because they'd bounced their way out of my set cleaning zone.\nIt's worth stating that robot vacuums are great for everyday maintenance cleans, but even the priciest models fall short of the results achieved with a decent manual vacuum. When I went to empty the Dreame's bin after use, it was packed full of dust and hair, so it certainly picked up plenty from my apartment; but following up with my Dyson Gen5detect saw even more dust collection.\nMopping performance\nTo mop, you need to clip on the full water tank with pre-dampened mop pad attached. I found filling the tank a little fiddly since it's so thin and the opening is small, and getting the wet mop pad back on proved a bit tricky, too. To Dreame's credit, the unit didn't leak at all while I was attaching it back onto the bot, as I had feared it might. There's no option to use this bot with a floor cleaner.\nThere are three water levels to choose from, and I selected the middle one for my mop tests. You can also choose from a couple of intensity settings: Daily mopping and Deep mopping (where the robot moves in \"a dense Z-shaped pattern\"). I opted for the latter, because the app warned there was a \"risk of skidding\" in this mode, which sounded exciting.\nIn fact, there was no skidding and I couldn't really see a difference in how it was moving compared to how it had previously navigated the rest of my apartment. However, it did an okay job of mopping, leaving a light, even sheen of water across the floor and clearing a wet spillage I'd introduced.\nTo see how it fared with trickier spillages, I smeared a tiny bit of ketchup on the floor. Unfortunately, it barely touched this at all, even after traversing the area three times. It seems that the vacuum isn't exerting enough pressure with its mop pad to clear anything other than surface dirt. That's not too surprising for a bot at this price point, but it's worth bearing in mind if mopping is a priority.\nThere's also some maintenance to be aware of. You'll need to remove and rinse the pad shortly after a mopping session (the app prompts you, which is helpful), as well as running it through the wash fairly regularly so it doesn't end up smelling. After my mopping session, there were bits of tea and oats on the pad along with the ketchup, even though I'd run the vacuuming tests separately, first. Next I drained the tank, although the placement of the inlet meant I couldn't empty it completely.\nSince the D9 Max Gen 2 can't lift its mop pads, you'll ideally want to avoid situations where the wet mop is being dragged over a carpeted area. As such, this bot isn't ideal for apartments such as mine, where there's a big carpeted room meeting three rooms with lino.\nIn short, I'm not wholly convinced this machine is better off for having mopping capabilities, or that I'd end up using them often. If you really want hands-free mopping, I'd recommend investing more in a machine with spinning circular mop pads that are able to lift over carpet, and a dock that can clean them.\n- Performance score: 4 out of 5\nDreame D9 Max Gen 2 review: app\n- Nicely designed and easy to use\n- Main functions covered, except you can't set a cleaning schedule\n- Pricier options offer more granular control\nThe Dreame app is well-designed and intuitive. It doesn't offer tons of settings compared to more premium options, but most of the key ones are covered.\nThe map is clear, and you can follow the bot in real-time as it makes its way around the home. You can split and merge rooms, add \"zones\", and create no-go zones if there's something you know is going to cause problems.\nThere's also an area where you can adjust your suction and water settings. If you switch on \"customized cleaning\", you can set personalized suction power and water for each area. It's also possible to adjust the order in which the bot cleans you rooms. While you can launch the bot remotely, you can't set a regular cleaning schedule for it to follow.\n- App score: 4 out of 5\nShould you buy the Dreame D9 Max Gen 2?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Budget price bracket, and feels well built for the price, offering a decent feature set and specs. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | A standard hybrid robovac with removable D-shaped mop pad and charge-only dock. Fairly basic in design, but good for the price. | 3.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Good mapping and navigation, but unreliable object avoidance. Vacuuming is good, but mopping functionality is underwhelming. | 4 / 5 |\nApp | Easy to use and nicely designed. Not as many options as you'll find on pricier robovacs, but the important controls options are all there. | 4 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou're on a budget\nWhile not the fanciest robovac around, you're getting a very decent bot for your money here. It's well-built, straightforward to use, and navigates reliably.\nYour priority is vacuuming\nThe vacuuming here is decent \u2013 the Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 performed well in my suction tests, and I could see it was cleaning my floors well from the amount of dust that was collected in the bin.\nYou have a smaller home\nThis model doesn't self-empty, which won't be an issue if you have a smaller home. It also means you won't have to make room for a massive dock.\nDon't buy it if...\nYour priority is mopping\nThe mopping here is perfunctory, and you'll need to take care of all mop maintenance yourself.\nYou often have cluttered floors\nWhile navigation is reliable, this Dreame bot doesn't do a good job of spotting, or avoiding, clutter on the floor.\nYou have a larger home or pets\nYou don't want to be emptying the small onboard bin every 30 minutes, so opt for a bot with a self-empty base \u2013 our favorite budget option in this category is the Roborock Q5 Pro+.\nHow I tested the Dreame D9 Max Gen 2\nI used the Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 as my main vacuum for a couple of weeks to get a feel for its general usability and performance. I also ran a series of suction tests to assess its cleaning power, asking it to pick up fine (tea) and chunky (oats) debris on hard floor as well as carpet. To test obstacle avoidance, I scattered common items you'd find around any home over my living room floor to see if it would bump into them or navigate around them. I also noted how effective it was at mopping, and whether it could cope with wet (water) and sticky (smeared ketchup) spillages.\nDuring my review period, I assessed how easy it was to set up the D9 Max Gen 2, the accuracy of its navigation, and if it generally performed as I'd want it to. I compared my experience with other robot vacuums I've tested, both budget and premium models.\nRead more about how we test robot vacuum cleaners.\n- First reviewed March 2025\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "The best cordless vacuum 2025: tested and recommended by experts\nThese were the stick vacuums that came out on top in our tests\nWith one of the best cordless vacuums you can clean all around your home without getting tangled in a power cord or having to constantly swap between outlets. While going cordless used to mean poor suction, short cleaning times and long waits for the battery to recharge, cordless vacuum technologies have improved massively over the past few years. Today's top models offer strong suction and impressive battery life, and most of today's best vacuum cleaners on the market are cordless models.\nAt TechRadar, we've tested over 185 vacuum cleaners over the course of nine years, including 41 new models last year. For each review, we assess each model's cleaning power on hard floor and carpet, how well it copes with different kinds of cleaning tasks (including pet hair), as well as things like battery life, comfort of use and maneuverability, effectiveness of any extra tools, and value for money.\nBased on our expertise and testing, the Shark Detect Pro Cordless is the best cordless vacuum for most people. It combines great pickup power with a maneuverable design and some useful smart features, all for a reasonable price tag. However, it won't be perfect for everyone, so this guide also includes a range of alternatives for different needs and budgets.\nQuick list\nBest buy\nBest overall\nThe R20 is the full package, for a very affordable price.

She's spent the past 15 months focusing on home appliances, and vacuum cleaners of all kinds in particular.\n3 July: The Dreame D20 has been shifted into the #1 spot. Previously, the Shark Detect Pro held this position, but it's increasingly hard to get hold of the version without the auto-empty base.\nThe best cordless vacuum cleaner for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a maneuverable vacuum: A lightweight carbon-fiber wand mean this vac is nice and nimble, plus the wand bends forwards to 90-degrees for cleaning under furniture.\n\u2705 You have delicate hard floor: This vacuum comes with a dedicated soft floorhead for hard floors you're worried about scratching up.\n\u274c You'd prefer button operation: The R20 is trigger-operated \u2013 although there is a button to activate continuous running if you need it.\n\u274c You'd like an auto-empty base: The Detect Pro at #4 has an auto-empty base; that's not an option here.\nThe Dreame R20 is the best cordless vacuum for most people \u2013 as well as being one of the very best vacuums of any kind we've tested. You might not immediately recognize the brand name, but we've consistently been impressed when testing Dreame's appliances \u2013 it's definitely one to watch. On test, we found the suction performance was superb, offering reliable cleaning on carpet and hard floor, and tackling large debris, fine dust, and sticky pet hair without issue.\nThis is one of the best-value vacuums on the market, sitting near the bottom of the mid-range bracket and punching well above its affordable price tag, with features you wouldn't expect at this price point. A case in point is the Auto mode, where the vacuum ramps up power when it senses the floor is especially dusty and lowers it when there's less dirt about. The (pricier) Dyson at #3 and Shark at #4 all offer slightly more advanced automation features, but the Dreame version of the tech will work just fine for most people.\nThere's a wide selection of attachments to amp up the versatility. That includes a dedicated fluffy floorhead for delicate hard floors (again generally not something that's included at this price point), and a mini motorized tool for cleaning furniture.\nAn innovative carbon fiber wand helps keep the weight right down, and it's easy to maneuver, with a wand that can bend forward to 90-degrees for cleaning under furniture. It's trigger-operated, and said trigger is a little too easy to activate accidentally, although that's not a major issue. At least Dreame has thought to provide a switch to activate continual running, so you don't end up with a tired finger if you're cleaning the whole house. We were surprised to note there's not really a low-powered mode for when you want to preserve battery, although the runtimes are so long that you might not need one.\nOverall, if you're after a very capable cleaner with helpful added features, all for an affordable price, the Dreame R20 is hard to beat.\nRead more: Dreame R20 cordless vacuum review\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Ultra-light wand, ergonomic to hold, looks modern. Trigger-operated, but can be switched to continuous. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Superb suction, easy to maneuver, and battery life is excellent. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | Lower-mid range, and exceptional value for what you're getting. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best cordless vacuum for pet hair\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have pets: The suction here is excellent for a cordless model, and great for pulling fur out of carpets and furniture.\n\u2705 You need to vacuum under furniture: Like most Shark vacuums, the Stratos has a wand that can bend forwards, so you can vacuum right under furniture without bending down.\n\u274c You have mostly hard floors: The Stratos is heavier and less smart than the Detect Pro (#4), so if you don't need the extra suction, you might prefer that model.\n\u274c You want something light and flexible: This is one of the heaviest options in our roundup.\nThe Shark Stratos is the best cordless vacuum for people with pets. It's heavier and less feature-packed than other models here, but the payoff is more power, which is key if you're trying to pull stubborn pet hair from your carpets. The floorhead has been designed in such a way that it'll funnel hair straight into the dust cup rather than letting it tangle and clog up the rollers \u2013 more useful for long human hair than short pet hair, but still worth noting.\nOne bonus feature is the built-in odor neutralizer puck, which keeps the machine smelling fresh. And while you won't get the dragonfly-like movement possibilities of a Dyson model like #3, it can pivot on the horizontal plane and on test we found it delivered good maneuverability. Our tester was especially impressed with the forward-bending wand, which is great for getting right under furniture.\nThe dust cup is more generously sized than the one on the Shark Detect Pro (#4), so you won't need to be heading to the trash nearly so often. However, unlike that model, there's no compatible self-empty base, so you will need to empty it manually. (If you're on the fence between the two models, our Shark Stratos vs Detect Pro article runs through the differences in detail.)\nWhile making your purchasing decision, it's worth bearing in mind that a corded vacuum (and often even a bulky upright vacuum) will almost always pack more power than a lightweight cordless model. So you'll want to weigh up if your priority is power or usability. Head to our guide to the best vacuums for pet hair for a range of alternatives.\nRead our full Shark Stratos Cordless with Clean Sense IQ IZ862H review\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Rather heavy, but packed with useful features like a forward-folding wand and odor-neutralizing puck. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Powerful suction and easy to maneuver despite being heavier. Good battery life. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | Mid-range at full price but deals are now easy to find and offer strong value for money. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best cordless Dyson vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a hi-tech vacuum: Expect advanced engineering and features you won't find elsewhere, including real-time dust reports as you clean.\n\u2705 You have hard floors: This vacuum comes with a Fluffy floorhead for hard floors, and it's equipped with a laser to illuminate any dust.\n\u274c You want the latest and greatest Dyson: The V15 offers the best cost-to-performance balance, but if you want the very latest smarts and maximum suction, you need the Gen5detect.\n\u274c You're on a tighter budget: It's an excellent machine, but you're paying a little bit more for the Dyson name \u2013 it's worth checking out Shark's range if you want maximum value for money.\nThe best Dyson cordless vacuum is the V15 Detect. (Actually, Dyson did away with cords a while ago, so the full range \u2013 with the exception of the Dyson Ball Animal \u2013 is cordless.) It's not without good reason that this brand is lauded so highly in the vacuum cleaner world \u2013 its cleaners have been meticulously engineered for maximum performance, and it continues to lead the way in terms of innovation too.\nThe V15 Detect is premium quality, meticulously engineered and delivers features that you won't find with any other brand. There's automatic suction adjustment based on dirt levels, but here it's coupled with real-time dust reports \u2013 so the vacuum senses the size and volume of particles being sucked up, and shows you via a colorful, moving graph on its screen. That way, you can see when the bit of floor you're cleaning is debris-free.\nLike the Dreame (#1), this vacuum also comes with a secondary soft floorhead for hard floors. However, here it's fitted with a laser light to highlight dust that might otherwise be missed. (It sits at the top of our best vacuum for hardwood floor ranking.)\nIf you set aside the bells and whistles, this is still an excellent vacuum. On test, we found this cordless vac sailed through all the cleaning tasks we put to it, delivering impressive suction even on the lowest-powered Eco mode. Like the rest of the Dyson range, it's incredibly easy to maneuver, with a floorhead that can pivot any which way you want it. The battery life is excellent, and the screen will spell out exactly how long you have left, so you shouldn't run out of juice unexpectedly. However, it's worth noting that the design is a little top-heavy, so it can feel unwieldy in handheld mode.\nDyson vacs are often expensive, so you'll need to balance how much you want to spend with which features you actually need. This is the second-newest model in the range \u2013 the fanciest and priciest option is the Gen5detect but we felt the V15 offered a better features-to-price ratio. If it's still a little pricey, check out your other options in our ranking of the best Dyson vacuums.\nRead our full Dyson V15 Detect review\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Sleek and well-designed, with features you won't find elsewhere. Can feel top-heavy. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Excellent suction and auto mode is a big effort-saver. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | High price mostly justified by the premium build quality and impressive engineering. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best auto-empty cordless vacuum cleaner\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You suffer from allergies: As well as saving effort, the auto-empty base means there's far fewer chances for dust to escape back into the air.\n\u2705 You have a mix of floor types: The Detect Pro will automatically adjust suction when it senses it's on carpet, for a fuss-free clean.\n\u274c You want maximum suction: If super suction is your priority, the Stratos Cordless (#2) or Halo (#7) are both better picks.\n\u274c You're tight on space: The dock is a little bulky and not especially attractive, and probably not worth it if you have a small home.\nIf you're looking for a low-effort solution, the Shark Detect Pro with Auto-Empty System is a great choice. The USP is that the base: dock your vac and all the dust will whoosh out, via a closed system, into a far larger dustbag in the base. Provided you have space for the base, it's a big effort-saver, and good news for allergy-sufferers too, because there are far fewer chances for dust a debris to escape back into the air.\nThe vacuum itself is very capable too. It's compact and lightweight, and offers an auto mode that responds to dirt levels, and will also amp up suction on the relevant side of the floorhead when it approaches the edge of a room where dust can collect. The suction isn't up there with the likes of the Stratos (#2) or Dyson (#3) but it'll be fine for most people, and especially if you don't have tons of carpet or pet hair to deal with. (If you want the auto-empty but need more suction, check out the Shark PowerDetect Cordless vacuum instead.)\nLike most cordless stick vacuums, the main machine converts easily into a handheld for cleaning furniture and overhead. In terms of extra attachments, they're a little limited, though \u2013 you might get just a Crevice tool, or possibly also a Pet Tool. You used to be able to purchase this vacuum without a base, but it's increasingly hard to get hold of these days \u2013 not to mention often pricier than the version with the base. See how the Detect Pro compares to other models from this brand's range in our guide to the best Shark vacuums.\nRead our full Shark Detect Pro Cordless review\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Lightweight and modern, and auto-empty base is useful if a bit bulky. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Decent power, easy to drive, and automation features work well. Solid runtimes. | 4 / 5 |\nValue | Officially mid-range; can be excellent value if you snag one of the regular deals. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best budget cordless vacuum in the US\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're on a budget: The Roidmi is very affordable and the performance is above what we'd expect for the price. An excellent budget pick.\n\u2705 You don't need fancy features: As you'd expect, it's just the basics here, but three power modes give you decent control over your clean.\n\u274c You live in the UK: The S2 isn't available here \u2013 the Henry (#6) is our favorite budget UK pick.\n\u274c You need to deal with lots of dust or hair: The dustbin is small and messy to empty, so those hoping to tackle larger volumes of dirt should look elsewhere.\nThe Roidmi S2 is our pick for the best budget vacuum around, and it's also a great choice if you're short on space. This stylish, matte white cordless vacuum comes with a thoughtful range of sturdy, well-made accessories. It offers three suction levels, selected via a button on the handle; and even the wall-mounted charging dock is compact and discreet. That makes it a good option for places where space is at a premium.\nThe Roidmi S2 has good suction and maneuverability, but it can be a little noisy to use. And inevitably there's a trade-off because of its small size: it has a small dust container, so you'll need to empty that fairly frequently. It's simple enough but it does mean this probably isn't the vacuum for you if you have a large home, shedding pets, or both.\nDon't pay the full asking price: this vacuum is almost constantly discounted, often by very large amounts. If you can bag this vacuum at a reduced price \u2013 in the region of $175 \u2013 then it's the best cheap vacuum around. If you live in the UK, where the S2 is very hard to find now, check out the Henry Quick (#6) instead.\nRead our full Roidmi S2 cordless vacuum cleaner review\nThe best budget cordless vacuum in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're on a budget: This Henry is affordable, and punches above its price tag when it comes to performance.\n\u2705 You have allergies: The fact this uses bags might be a benefit to those who struggle with allergies, and don't want particles escaping back into the air when emptying.\n\u274c You live in the US: You can find this model in the US, but it's generally pretty expensive. Stateside shoppers should look at the Roidmi at #5, instead.\n\u274c You want something bagless: If you're wary of ongoing costs, or want to see what you've sucked up, the Henry isn't the vacuum for you.\nBrits looking for a bargain cordless vacuum should definitely check out the Henry Quick \u2013 a stick sibling to the iconic (if unwieldy) cylinder vacuum, with the same friendly face (although here it's a bit more awkwardly placed). It delivers outstanding performance for a very affordable price. You can get it in the US, but it's less good value for money there.\nOn test, our reviewer found that the full power setting was on a par with their favorite corded vacuum, and the lowest setting worked brilliantly on hard floors. If you have pets around the home then the Henry Quick will gamely tease the stray hairs with ease from the hard floors, plus upholstery and deep-pile carpets. Since it's bagged, you can just release the bag from the Henry Quick and get on with your day, making it a solid option for allergy-sufferers. The bags have a higher capacity than your standard cordless vacuum, although not as generous as the other bagged model on our list \u2013 the Halo at #7.\nOur only real complaints are that this vacuum can be a little heavy when in use for long periods, and the fact you'll need to shell out for new bags.\nRead our full Numatic Henry Quick review\nThe best cordless vacuum for carpet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want excellent suction: Our experienced tester was extremely impressed with the suction on this vacuum; good news for pet owners, those with lots of carpet, or anyone who just wants to deep clean.\n\u2705 You need decent maneuverability: While not on a part with a Dyson, the floorhead here pivots well, and getting it in and around furniture is straightforward.\n\u274c You want cutting-edge tech: This is one of the more basic options here \u2013 you won't get information screens or automatic suction adjustment.\n\u274c You don't want a bagged machine: Bags represent an ongoing cost, and a little extra fuss. If you want to avoid, there are plenty of excellent bagless options in this list.\nThe Halo Capsule X is our favorite cordless vacuum for carpet, although if you have a mix of floor types, you'll be pleased to hear it's equally effective on hard floors. The slightly quirky design delivers excellent suction and very impressive pickup. It also feels nice and light in the hand, and is comfortable to use and maneuver (although for maximum pivotability, you can't beat a Dyson like #3).\nIt's one of very few bagged vacuums in this list, which might be a deal-breaker for some, although it does have its benefits \u2013 you can use it to suck up fine particles like fireplace ash without ruining the motor, for example. The bags have a massive 2L capacity \u2013 at least double the size of all other models on this list. Although they still represent an ongoing cost, they are made from compostable cardboard and brown paper, so at least you don't need to worry too much about environmental impact.\nHalo promises 60 minutes of cleaning in the lowest power mode, and the battery is swappable so you could get two full hours of power before having to plug in again. As with all cordless vacs, runtimes drop when using more powerful settings, and in our tests, our reviewer managed 25 minutes of cleaning in the medium mode.\nIf you want features like automatic power adjustment look elsewhere in this list, but for pure power that's great for carpet, the Halo Capsule X is a top choice.\nRead our full Halo Capsule X Pet Max review\nThe best cordless vacuum for hard floors\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have hard floors: On test, we were impressed with the pickup on hard floors, as well as finding it comfortable to use and easy to move around.\n\u2705 You have furry friends: The Pet version of this vacuum comes with a mini motorized pet hair brush that's one of the best we've tested.\n\u274c You have carpet: This cordless vacuum didn't offer such good performance on carpet \u2013 consider the Halo (#7) or Stratos (#2) instead.\n\u274c You often have to suck up chunky spillages: There's a roller in the front of the floorhead that sits flush to the floor, making it tricky to pick up larger debris.\nThe Samsung Jet 85 Pet is the best vacuum cleaner for hard floors. Although it's actually one of the heaviest models here, the balance of the design means it feels light in the hand and is comfortable to use, with good maneuverability and excellent pickup power on hard floors. There are four suction modes, and you'll get a decent 44 minutes of cleaning time on the lowest of these. If you really need to break out the big guns, you can unleash the 'Jet' mode this vacuum gets its name from, but our tester found that perhaps a little too powerful.\nThere's a mini motorized pet tool designed for use on upholstery, and we were extremely impressed with how well it worked to get hair out of furniture \u2013 it's easily as good as the equivalent tool from Dyson. However, we weren't so impressed with the performance of the main vacuum cleaner on carpet, so if you have a mix of floor types in your home then you'd be better off with something like the Dreame (#1). Unfortunately, it's also currently not available in the US.\nRead our full Samsung Jet 85 Pet vacuum cleaner review\nThe best cordless handheld vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a powerful handheld: The suction here is great for a handheld vacuum.\n\u2705 You want something versatile: This vacuum comes with a range of tools for different tasks, meaning it can tackle different kinds of cleanup tasks.\n\u274c You want to be able to clean the floor: Most vacuums here convert into handheld models \u2013 of them all, the Roidmi (#5) and Halo (#8) are the lightest in weight.\n\u274c You want to clean for a long time: The battery life here is okay, but the battery isn't swappable, so you'll need to wait for it to recharge if you want longer.\nThe Shark UltraCyclone Pet Pro+ (or the Shark Classic Handheld Pet Vacuum CH950UKT in the UK) is a different kind of thing than. While many of today's best cordless vacuums can be transformed into a handheld model by removing the wand, this vac is designed specifically to be a portable vacuum. If you need something to clean your home, look literally anywhere else in this list.\nHowever, if you want something for small and awkward cleaning tasks, like the footwells of your car, your stairs, or the crevices of your furniture, the UltraCyclone is for you. There's only one power setting, but it delivers good suction, and the battery life is decent for a vacuum of this type. There's a range of useful tools for different tasks \u2013 in our review, we were especially impressed by the motorized pet hair tool and the crevice tool. It's also nice and affordable, and great value for what you're getting.\nOn the downside, the main body of the vacuum is a little on the bulky side, so it can be difficult to get it into particularly tight corners. Our guide to the best car vacuum has plenty of alternatives, if you want more options.\nRead our full Shark Ultracyclone Pet Plus Pro review\nSpecs comparison\nModel | Bagless | Weight | Bin size | Max runtime |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n1.

Meet some of the expert reviewers who tested the cordless vacuums that feature in this guide.\nSharmishta is TechRadar's APAC Managing Editor. She has spent the past seven years testing vacuum cleaners of all shapes and sizes \u2013 Dyson, Shark, Ecovacs and other brands in-between. She's fascinated by how far robot vacuums have come in the last few years, but also appreciates a lightweight cordless vacuum that can get into the tight spaces of her flat.\nHelen is a freelance writer who specializes in kitchen and home appliances, and has been testing vacuums since 2008. She has reviewed well over 100 different models, from the likes of Shark, Dyson and more, and is always on the lookout for a lightweight, maneuverable vacuum that's powerful and comes with the perfect selection of tools.\nThe best cordless vacuum: alternatives to consider\nShark Wandvac System\nThis is essentially a handheld vacuum with a wand and floorhead that can be attached for slightly larger cleaning tasks. In our Shark Wandvac System review, we recommended it as a lightweight option. Beware, though: the bin and battery life are handheld-sized, so don't expect to clean your whole home with it.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet\nThis premium vacuum can mop as well as vacuuming, and comes self-cleaning functionality. In our Samsung Bespoke Jet vacuum cleaner review, we were also impressed with the suction power \u2013 it handled hair and spillages of all kinds with no issues. It's an investment, but deals are fairly common now, a few years after launch.\nProscenic P12\nThis is a more affordable vacuum that offers an impressive featureset for its wallet-friendly price \u2013 there's five-stage HEPA filtration, four suction levels, floorhead headlamps, and as an LED display. In our Proscenic P12 review we found pickup good, although perhaps a little underpowered for homes with lots of carpet.\nFAQs\nWhat is the best cordless vacuum?\nRight now, we think the best cordless vacuum is the Shark Detect Pro Cordless (#1). It offers a balance of suction performance, usability and tech smarts that will suit a wide range of customers and home types, and comes in at an affordable price, too. A close runner-up is the Dreame R20 (#2), which comes with a second cleaner head specifically for hard floors. However, if you have more specific needs, we have also included plenty of alternative options in our guide. So if you need to tackle pet hair, you'll want the extra power of the Shark Stratos (#3), for example.\nWhat are the best cordless vacuum brands?\nWe think the two best cordless vacuum brands right now are Dyson and Shark. Both consistently test very well, but which one will suit you best will depend on your priorities.\nDyson tends to have the edge when it comes to cutting-edge tech and meticulous engineering. It has a more limited range of vacuums, but they have been carefully honed to offer the very best suction, battery life, maneuverability and cleaning efficiency. However, as a general rule they're pricier than Shark models, perhaps less good value for money, and less robust.\nShark is a newer name in the vacuum world, and its offerings are often less tech-focused. However, there are still clever practical innovations \u2013 a great example is that many of its stick vacuums are able to bend forward, allowing you to easily clean beneath furniture. Shark's vacuums tend to be cheaper and perhaps better value than Dyson's. It also has a wider, more confusing range, with models appearing and disappearing regularly.\nRead our Shark vs Dyson article for a more in-depth look at the two leading cordless vacuum brands.\nHow much suction should my cordless vacuum have?\nThis is a tricky one. It's rare that a vacuum brand will publish any suction specs, and even if it does, there are multiple different units by which suction power can be measured, making it difficult to figure out how much suction a vacuum has, let alone compare between different models.\nIt's far simpler in the robot vacuum world: there, brands use Pascals (Pa) as standard, and specs range from around 3,000 for a budget model, right up to over 10,000Pa for a premium model (there's a new wave of robot vacuums that go right up to 22,000Pa, which is extremely high).\nAs a rule of thumb, you can expect robot vacuums to have less outright suction, corded upright vacuums to have the most, and cordless stick vacuums to sit somewhere in the middle. Vacuum brand Eufy suggests that 'carpet vacuums' typically offer between 7,000 and 15,000Pa of suction, and that you should look on the upper end of that range if you want a deep clean.\nAre stick vacuums worth it?\nIn many cases, yes. The main benefit of a cordless stick vacuum is that you have the freedom to clean anywhere, without having to wrangle a cord, or being tethered to a power outlet. They also tend to be lighter and easier to maneuver than corded alternatives, and today's best models are available at a wide range of price points to suit different budgets. However, you will have to remember to charge the battery, the dust cup might be on the smaller side, and in general you should expect suction to be a little less than on a corded model.\nHow long should a cordless stick vacuum last?\nRoughly, you should expect a cordless stick vacuum to last between 3 and 5 years. However, this figure will vary by vacuum, and also be affected by how often you use it and how well you care for it. For more information, head to our guide to how long your vacuum should last. Also check out our tips for making your vacuum last longer, to maximize your investment.\nWhich cordless vacuum has the longest battery life?\nA typical cordless cleaner can run for between 40 to 60 minutes on a fully charged battery. Of the best cordless vacuums in this guide, the Dreame R20 actually offers the longest runtime, with up to an hour and a half on one charge. That's followed by the Numatic Henry Quick at #7 and Dyson Gen5detect at #10 jointly with maximum runtimes of 70 minutes. But that's based on using them in their lowest power mode, which won't be the same for all models. Plus, you'll typically find that if you run your cordless at max power you'll get far shorter runtimes.\nHow to choose the best cordless vacuum for you\nWith such a wide array of option on the market, figuring out the best cordless vacuum for your needs can feel like an overwhelming task. To help simplify things, it's worth focusing on a few key specifications.\nBattery life\nStart by checking how long the battery will last on one charge. Most of the best cordless vacuums now offer up to an hour's cleaning on one charge, while the most advanced models go right up to 70 minutes. Do bear in mind that'll be for the lowest power mode, though. It's also worth looking at whether the battery is swappable, so if you run out of power mid-clean you don\u2019t have to wait for it the battery to recharge before you can carry on.\nDust canister size\nThe size of the dust canister will also affect how many interruptions there are to your cleaning session. Roughly 0.8L is about standard and will work for most people. Less than that and expect to be emptying it fairly regularly. If you have a bigger house or lots of dust and dirt, look for 'outsized' models with larger dust cups, or consider a bagged model (these tend to have larger dust capacity).\nTools\nMost of the cordless vacuums in our list come with at least a few swappable tools to help with specific tasks. If you have hard floors, look for a model that comes with a dedicated cleaner head \u2013 this has a softer brush roll to ensure the flooring isn\u2019t damaged when vacuuming. Dyson vacuums have a compatible soft roller (read more about the Dyson vacuum tools).\nAlso, check the vacuum cleaner will be able to reach under furniture and in any tight spaces you have in your home to ensure you\u2019re thoroughly cleaning your floors every time you push a vacuum around. And if you want to get into hard-to-reach areas, a crevice tool is an absolute must.\nIf you have furry friends, look for a model that has factored this into its design \u2013 some of the models here, such as the Shark Stratos Cordless (#3) and the Halo Capsule X Pet Max (#8) can clean without getting clogged by furballs; the Shark will even neutralize unwanted smells.\nBudget\nThere's no right or wrong make or model to choose here, but it is important to get the best cordless vacuum for your particular circumstances: a do-it-all Dyson may be state of the art, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best buy for you right now. If you live in a small flat, something like the reasonably-priced Shark Stratos Cordless should cover nearly all your needs.\nIf you\u2019re still unsure, read our advice on which type of vacuum should you buy and read our comparison of canister vs upright vacuums and bagged vs bagless vacuums.\nHow we tested these cordless vacuums\n\u2705 Over 185 vacuums and robot vacuums tested in total\n\u2705 ... including 41 new vacuums reviewed in 2024\n\u2705 9 years of vacuum testing experience\nNot all cordless vacuums were created equal, but figuring out which is the best model for your needs can be tricky. To help you make the right choice for you, we test dozens of different models each year. Each cordless vacuum featured here has been put through its paces either by a TechRadar Homes team member or by one of our regular, experienced reviewers.\nOur reviews are underpinned by a set of specific, standardized tests. Here's a rundown of our review process.\nSuction tests\nOur suction tests assess how well the vacuum can pick up different kinds of debris on different types of flooring. For fine debris, we use a teabag's worth of dry tea, and for larger debris we use oats. We sprinkle 20g of each mixture (separately) on hard floor and on carpet / a rug, and see how many passes are required to clear the spillage. We start on the vacuum's lowest suction setting, and increase if there is debris remaining.\nThe final suction test is to see how well the cordless vacuum can pick up hair from both carpet and hard flooring \u2013 both the main floorhead and any hair-specific attachments. We also check to see if the hair becomes tangled in the brushroll, and if so, how easy it is to remove.\nBattery tests\nBattery life is a major element of cordless vacuums. We time how long the vacuum lasts on a single charge, on each available suction setting. We also record how long it takes to completely recharge, from a flat battery.\nGeneral tests\nAlongside specific suction and battery tests, we also assess how usable the vacuum is in general. The reviewer will use the vacuum regularly for at least a couple of weeks, testing out any provided attachments and special features. We'll also consider things like how easy the vacuum is to maneuver, how functional the design is in terms of swapping attachments, emptying the bin and so on, and how comfortable it is to use in general.\nRead more on how we test cordless vacuum cleaners.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

Read on for the best hair dryers around.\nThe best hair dryer 2025: quick list\nTop choice\nBest overall\nThe T3 AireLuxe is an excellent all-rounder, with a balanced, ergonomic design and plenty of features, including a volume boost and lots of heat settings.\nSpeedy dryer\nBest fast\nOn test, we found the GHD Helios was super-efficient at getting hair dry. It lacks some of the extra features of other models, but it's a great choice for thick hair.\nBudget option\nBest cheap\nThis affordable hair dryer offers fast drying times and is pretty lightweight. It's great for smaller budgets, but doesn't pack the power of pricier models.\nBest premium\nBest premium\nThis tech-packed hair dryer adjusts temperature to protect your scalp, and drops to low-power mode when put down.

There's temperature cycling and a gentle child-friendly mode, and cool (if slightly confusing) design.\nBest for frizz\nBest for frizzy hair\nThis dryer comes with an excellent anti-frizz attachment, plus various styling modes to promote hair health. The lightweight, foldable design dryer packs plenty of power, too.\nLoad the next 4 products...\nPro level\nBest for styling\nThe r's unusual shape makes it super easy to direct the airflow, even in awkward spots.

The build is lightweight, and well balanced so it's comfortable to hold. It also comes packed with features and settings: there's a fantastic ion generator to get rid of frizz, volume boost switch for salon-style blowouts, and 'RapidAire IQ technology', which widens the airflow for quicker drying.\nMost dryers in this list offer three temperature settings, while the AireLuxe comes with five \u2013 although our tester did think the hottest of those could have been a bit hotter. Two concentrator nozzles come included, and there's a compatible diffuser and smoothing comb available to purchase separately. The AireLuxe costs around the same as our #2 pick, the GHD Helios, but this model is lighter and offers more styling options.\nRead our full T3 AireLuxe review\nThe best fast hair dryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want speedy drying: The Helios dries hair remarkably quickly. If efficiency is your priority, it's a top choice.\n\u2705 You don't want a fussy dryer: With only a few settings to choose from, this dryer is simple but effective.\n\u274c You're a haircare enthusiast: The featureset here is basic; look elsewhere in the list for more cutting-edge options.\n\u274c You want a cool-looking dryer: The shape is traditional \u2013 more brands are embracing a minimalist barrel these days.\nThe GHD Helios has been around a little longer, but remains the fastest hair dryer we've tested. If you have thick hair, this will get the job done quickly. On test, our reviewer found it left her hair feeling smooth and frizz-free with minimal flyaways.\nFor that speed, though, you'll sacrifice some features. This model is basic in terms of controls, with just two speeds and two temperatures to choose from, plus a cool shot. That'll be fine for most people, but there are options in this list that deliver more control if you're looking for something for more advanced styling.\nThe design isn't the most modern-looking but we are fans of the selection of stylish colorway options, as well as the soft-touch coating. It's also well-balanced and comfortable to use, it's not too noisy, and the cord is equal longest on this list. You'll get a concentrator included, and there's a compatible diffuser available to purchase if you need one.\nRead our full GHD Helios review\nThe best budget hair dryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're on a budget: This is by far the cheapest hair dryer on our list, and does a good job for such a low price.\n\u2705 You just need something simple: There are no bells and whistles here, but not everyone needs them.\n\u274c You want precise control: There's a below-average 2 speeds here, and of the 3 temperatures, our tester found the lowest too cool to be useful.\n\u274c You want a high quality dryer: While it delivers good value for money, this budget-friendly dryer doesn't look or feel especially premium.\nNot everyone needs an ultra-fancy hair dryer. If you're on a budget and just want something simple, the Hot Tools Pro Signature Salon (also known as the Hot Tools Pro Signature Salon 1875 Watts Ionic AC Motor) is the best cheap hair dryer we've tested.\nIt's not the fanciest model on this list, not does it have the premium feel of pricier hair dryers. However, it does the job, taking our reviewer's shoulder-length fine hair from wet to dry on the hottest setting in a similar time to more expensive models in this list.\nYou have two speed settings to choose from, and three heats, although on test we found the lowest one was too cool to be of any use. It's not super-bulky or heavy, although the cord is a little short at 1.8m. We were also a little disappointed to see that the filter isn\u2019t removable, which makes cleaning the hair dryer fiddly. However, for the price it's an excellent buy.\nRead our full Hot Tools Pro Signature Salon Ionic AC motor review\nThe best premium hair dryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You love to style your hair: The Supersonic Nural has a wide range of useful attachments, and comes into its own for those with complex styling needs.\n\u2705 You're worried about heat damage: Automatic temperature adjustment means you can dry your hair with precision, without worrying about frying your locks.\n\u274c You're on a budget: The Nural is the priciest model here \u2013 you can pick up extremely good hair dryers (without all the features) for a much lower price.\n\u274c You have simple styling needs: If you aren't going to make use of the various attachments and Auto mode, the Supersonic Nural is going to be overkill.\nIt'll be out of many people's budgets, but if you have cash to splash and want the best of the best, the Dyson Supersonic Nural is it. It has features you won't find on any another hair dryer. For example, in Auto mode, a sensor monitors how close the dryer is to your head, and adjusts heat so there's a constant temperature on your scalp, allowing for precision styling with less heat damage. The Nural also knows when it has been put down, and swaps to low-power mode in response.\nIt comes with a wide range of well designed attachments for different hair types \u2013 so not just your regular concentrator, but a comb attachment for coily hair, a very effective flyaway-flattening tool (using tech borrowed from the Dyson Airwrap) and a two-in-one diffuser that dries and defines curls. The Nural is also smart enough to know which tool is clipped on and switches to the last-used temperature and speed, to save you from manually adjusting each time. Bells and whistles aside, it's powerful and efficient yet lightweight and comfortable to hold (if we're being picky, we'd prefer a slightly longer handle).\nIf you aren't fussed about all the sensors but like the sleek design, the original and super-popular Dyson Supersonic might be a better fit \u2013 see all the differences in our Dyson Supersonic vs Nural comparison article. Or if you're keen to protect your hair from extreme heat but don't have the budget for a Nural, the Zuvi Halo is worth a look.\nRead our full Dyson Supersonic Nural review\nThe best mini hair dryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need something transportable: The Laifen Mini is as small as its name would suggest, and comes with a bag for easy packing.\n\u2705 You worry about scalp health: This dryer has a temperature cycling mode that's apparently better for scalp health.\n\u274c You like to keep things simple: The controls here are confusing, and not everyone will want or need the extra modes.\n\u274c You have curly hair: There's no compatible diffuser to go with this dryer.\nThe Laifen Mini is the best mini hair dryer we've tested. The shrunk-down size and the fact it comes with a carry bag makes it a strong choice for travel, although it's powerful and feature-packed enough to also work as a main hair dryer for anyone short on space, too.\nAlongside your standard heat and windspeed options, there are a couple of advanced options we wouldn't expect on a mini dryer: a temperature-cycling mode that's meant to be better for your long-term scalp health, and a low-pressure Child mode for delicate hair.\nThe controls take some getting used to \u2013 you use different length presses on the power button to activate the different modes, and the setting you're in is indicated (only) by the shifting colors of the glowing ring around the barrel. This does look very cool, though. In fact, we're big fans of the look of the Mini in general, with its stylish matte finish and on-trend range of colors. All that for a very affordable price.\nThere are a few frustrations. The cord is a little on the short side, the lack of compatible diffuser will frustrate curly-haired shoppers, and it's also not available in the US at this point. However, overall this is a very strong addition to Laifen's lineup \u2013 and a more unique offering than it's previous the Dyson-inspired offerings (#10).\nRead the full Laifen Mini review\nThe best hair dryer for frizz\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You struggle with frizz: This dryer has an excellent frizz-busting attachment, plus multiple drying modes geared towards styling and protecting hair.\n\u2705 You need something compact: The foldable design makes this dryer perfect for popping in your overnight bag for weekends away.\n\u274c You value a long cord: At 5ft / 1.5m, the cable here is irritatingly short.\n\u274c You need a concentrator: Weirdly, there's no compatible concentrator (or diffuser, for that matter).\nIf you're looking hair dryer to manage frizz, check out the Dreame Pocket. It comes bundled with an 'Unfrizz' nozzle that's reminiscent of the Dyson flyaway attachment. Our reviewer found it took a little time to get used to, but once she'd mastered it, it made her hair smooth and healthy looking, and proved invaluable for getting second-day and bed-hair under control. Our review model also came with a curling wand, but this doesn't seem to be included as standard any more (and weirdly, there's no compatible concentrator or diffuser, either).\nFurther to that, you're getting multiple modes geared towards styling. You have five temperature modes to choose from: cold, warm and hot, but also 'Instant Cold Air' and a 'Hot & Cold Cycling Mode'. That last one is designed to reduce heat damage, and while it will extend drying times, our tester found it made a noticeable difference to the finish and feel of her hair \u2013 important if you're trying to ward off frizz in the longer term.\nThis dryer will also work well as a travel hair dryer. While it doesn't have the dual voltage of the GHD Flight+ (#7), the foldable design is compact and very lightweight, and you'll get a carry bag to keep everything neat. Beware though: the cable is short, which will be annoying if your mirror isn't near a power outlet.\nRead the full Dreame Pocket hair dryer review\nThe best hair dryer for styling\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You spend a long time drying your hair: The Supersonic r is powerful yet lightweight, and comfortable to hold for long periods.\n\u2705 You love to create complex styles: It very easy to direct the airflow here, plus there's a wide range of attachments to explore.\n\u274c Your priority is scalp health: This dryer lacks the Scalp health features found on the Nural (which is also a little cheaper).\n\u274c You're on a budget: This is the priciest dryer in our roundup \u2013 it's excellent, but there are plenty of cheaper, less fancy options capable of creating similar end results.\nThe Dyson Supersonic r has an unusual shape that makes it supremely easy to direct the airflow, so precision styling is simple, even in awkward spots like the back of your head. Dyson has also redesigned the motor and shifted some of the mechanics into the plug (which \u2013 beware \u2013 is very chunky) in order to deliver a streamlined, lightweight build that's comfortable to use for long periods. It began life as a professional-only dryer, so it's built for extended and intensive use.\nThe airflow is powerful, although the range of settings is pretty standard (three airflow options, three temperatures and a cool shot). On test, we found the small rocker switches that control power and heat were a little fiddly, although the cool shot button is perfectly placed for comfortable use without having to look.\nThere's a wide range of compatible attachments \u2013 not just your standard concentrator and diffuser, but things like a flyaway smoother and wide tooth comb for coils. Not all are included as standard, so make sure you buy the right bundle for your hair type. Like the Nural (#4), this dryer will recognize which attachment is snapped on and revert to your last-used settings with each \u2013 a clever innovation that helps streamline the styling process.\nThe price tag is ultra-premium, and it sports fewer special features than the (slightly cheaper; still expensive) Nural. However, if your priority is lightweightness and efficiency for salon-level styling, the Supersonic r is a superb choice.\nRead our full Dyson Supersonic r review\nThe best hair dryer with a brush\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to create a bouncy, blow dry look: This brush dryer is specifically for creating voluminous, bouncy locks.\n\u2705 You're on a budget: It's is one of the cheapest dryers on this list, and on test we found the results were consistently excellent.\n\u274c You also want to be able to rough dry: You won't be able to achieve a quick, rough dry with this tool \u2013 a regular hair dryer offers more versatility.\n\u274c You want a stylish tool: This Revlon brush dryer isn't winning any awards for styling.\nThe Revlon Pro Collection One-Step Dryer & Volumiser is the best brush hair dryer we've tested. It's effectively a large brush with air vents hidden in the bristles to smooth and shape your hair as you dry it. You won't be able to rough-dry with this tool, but if you want something to purely to create bouncy, blowout looks, it's ideal \u2013 and on that front, it could well be the best hair dryer for fine hair.\nAt 880W it's relatively low powered compared to most models in this ranking, but on test we found it plenty powerful enough for a brush dryer. You're rather limited on settings: you can choose between hotter and faster, and cooler and slower. While the former proved unpleasantly noisy, our reviewer found the lower setting was efficient enough not to have to use the higher one.\nSo there are a few compromises in terms of features, and the design is also far from the most stylish around, but our reviewer was so impressed with the results that she was willing to forgive all that. It consistently delivered bouncy, smooth results. It's also one of the cheapest options in this list.\nRead our full Revlon Pro Collection One-Step Dryer and Volumiser review\nThe best hair dryer for travel\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You travel regularly: The USP here is a voltage that can be toggled to suit different countries' power supplies. Plus, it folds down for packing.\n\u2705 You prefer a traditional dryer shape: While everyone else is embracing the Supersonic silhouette, GHD has kept to a traditional dryer shape, but made it foldable.\n\u274c You need to dry your hair quickly: On test, the Flight+ took a relatively long time to get our reviewer's hair dry.\n\u274c You want lots of control: This dryer has relatively limited settings compared to others in this list.\nFinding a good hair dryer for travel can be a challenge: it has to be light and compact for easy packing, but it needs to achieve this without being underpowered and while having enough controls to do a good job. And ideally it should work with any country's power supply. The GHD Flight+ succeeds in most of these areas.\nThe main USP here is its ability to toggle between 240V and 120V of power, but it also comes with a folding handle that makes it much more packable. However, it's far from the most powerful hair dryer we've tested \u2013 it took our reviewer nearly eight minutes to rough dry her long, fine hair on its fastest setting, and left it feeling soft but frizzy and lacking in shine. There are also fewer setting options than most hair dryers: two speeds and just one heat setting plus cool shot.\nIt's decent value for money and good quality, but if you don't need that swappable voltage then there are plenty of other options available to you \u2013 our favorite being the Dreame Pocket at #5 (although that one isn't available in the US).\nRead our full GHD Flight+ hair dryer review\nThe best Dyson alternative hair dryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You can't afford a Supersonic: It's not as good as a Supersonic, but this is still a perfectly decent hair dryer, for a much more affordable price.\n\u2705 You love the Supersonic look: To be honest, the main selling point for this hairdryer is that streamlined design, with the snap-on magnetic attachments.\n\u274c You live in the UK: This one's not available in the UK.\n\u274c You want to be able to set your style: Unusually amongst our best hair dryer picks, this one doesn't have a cool shot option.\nThe Laifen Swift bears a striking resemblance to the ultra-popular Dyson Supersonic Nural (#4) but comes in at a far more pocket-friendly price. It packs some pretty cool tech \u2013 intelligent thermal sensors designed to monitor temperature in real time to minimize heat damage. It's surprising, then, that it lacks more standard features like a standalone cool shot setting.\nMuch like the name implies, the Laifen Swift offers rapid hair drying with its high-powered jets of ionized air. During our testing, we were impressed that this hair dryer could completely dry damp, thick, medium-length hair on its highest setting in about seven minutes. It's not as powerful as the original Dyson Supersonic (which clocked four and a half minutes in the same test), but it's a very decent alternative. For less porous and thinner hair, expect your hair to dry in around five and a half minutes, which is roughly in line with the manufacturer\u2019s claims.\nIt goes get a bit hot during use, but not uncomfortably so \u2013 though watch out for the accessories, which heat up too. Luckily, they are easily removed, thanks to the magnetic fixture. This hair dryer isn't currently available in the UK and it doesn't look like it's going to be any time soon.\nRead our full Laifen Swift review\nSpecs comparison table\nModel | Wattage | Weight | Speeds | Temperatures | Cord |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n1.

On that front, you want to consider windspeed and temperature. For windspeed power, the spec you're looking at here is wattage: higher wattage generally means more power and quicker drying. There's no spec to indicate how hot a hair dryer is going to be, and bear in mind that too much heat will fry your hair, so it's not just a case of the-hotter-the-better, either.\nIt's also worth factoring in the settings on offer. Most of today's best hair dryers come with three speed options and three temperature options, plus a cool shot to set your style. This gives you a decent amount of control over how you want to dry your hair, and whether you want to prioritize speed or control / hair health.\nWeight and size\nAnother thing to factor in is how comfortable a hair dryer will be to use \u2013 and especially if you have longer or thicker hair, and are going to need to be wielding it for a relatively long time. For this, look at weight and size. How the weight is distributed will also play into this; the Supersonics have most of their weight in the handle, which makes them more comfortable to hold than models that weight the same but have heavier barrel sections.\nNote that high wattage hair dryers are usually powered by an AC (alternating current) motor, which makes them heavier. Lower wattage hair dryers are more lightweight because they tend to use lighter DC (direct current) motors but they\u2019re not as powerful.\nCord length\nDo not underestimate how annoying a short cord can be. Especially worth factoring in if your home's power outlets aren't located near your mirrors.\nTools\nMost hair dryers will come with your basic concentrator nozzle, and many also have the option of a diffuser for curly hair. If you have more specific styling needs, some premium options offer more advanced tools. The standout here is Dyson, which has engineered a wide range of tools for different hair types and lengths.\nOf course, you don't just need to go for a basic hair dryer \u2013 there are plenty of styling tools that also dry hair. If you just want to do bouncy blow-dries, you could opt for a dedicated brush dryer. We're also seeing more options that convert from hair dryer to styler (the Dyson AirWrap and Shark FlexStyle, for example), offering greater flexibility.\nExtra features\nBack in the day, the most exciting features you could hope for on your hair dryer were a cool shot (to set your style) and ionic technology (for reducing frizz). Now, both of those are very common on the market.\nIncreasingly, we're starting to see more advanced features geared towards improving hair health. For example, some dryers will have a temperature cycling mode to help lessen heat damage. The Dyson Supersonic Nural has sensors so it knows how close it is to your head, and raises or lowers the heat to maintain a constant temperature on your scalp.\nHeating element\nIf you're worried about hair health, it's worth looking into which heating element your hair dryer comes with. This is the part that warms the air before its projected from the barrel. Dyers with metal elements tend to be more affordable but will cause more heat damage, while ceramic elements distribute heat more evenly, and thus should be gentler on your hair. Finally, tourmaline elements release negative ions in the airflow, which speeds up evaporation of the water molecules reducing drying time and making hair appear smoother.\nOnce you've chosen your new hair dryer, it may be helpful to check out our guides on how to blow dry your hair the right way and which hair dryer settings you should use to get the results you want without doing any damage.\nFrequently asked questions about hair dryers\nWhich hair dryer brand is best?\nBased on our testing, the best hair dryer brands include GHD, T3 and Dyson. GHD is best for reliable, efficient dryers, while T3 has a wider range of offers more innovative features. If you have cash to splash, you should opt for a Dyson. This brand makes consistently excellent hair dryers, which mix efficiency with cutting-edge additions.\nWhat hair dryer is best for curly hair?\nThose with curly hair should opt for a hair dryer that includes / has a compatible diffuser. This is a bowl-shaped attachment with protruding prongs, and is designed to offer a gentle, wide flow of air to set curls in place.\nWhile many hair dryers come with a diffuser, some are more specialized than others. Shark makes a diffuser with extendable prongs, for example, while Dyson makes one where the prongs can be removed to leave a dome, to shape and define curls.\nIs a hair dryer harmful to hair?\nYes \u2013 regularly using a hair dryer on your hair can cause damage to the surface. However, it's not quite as clear-cut as you might assume. A 2011 study found that using a hair dryer on hair only damaged the outer cuticle layer of hair, and didn't reach the inner cortex layer. It also found that air drying in fact caused damage to the cell membrane complex (the glue that hold your hair cells together), while blow drying did not, and came to the ultimate conclusion that blow drying your hair at a distance of 15cm and keeping the dryer moving led to less damage than leaving it to air dry naturally.\nTemperature matters, too. A 1984 study found that applying heat of more than 140C (284F) caused \"profound and irreversible\" changed to the structure of the hair, and suggested a drying temperature of 60C (140F) was optimal.\nThere are precautions you can take to lessen heat damage. It's best not to start with sopping wet hair; ideally you'd get it 70-80% dry before going in with heat \u2013 for best results, you should squeeze it with a microfiber towel. Apply a heat protector spray, stick to a lower heat level and keep the dryer moving. Some dryers now offer a temperature cycling mode, which shifts between hot and cool, to lessen heat damage.\nWhat does wattage mean for hair dryers?\nThe wattage is a rough indicator of how much power a hair dryer has, which can translate to it being capable of hotter temperatures and faster airspeeds, which in turn can mean quicker drying. Anything over 1500W is acceptable, and if you want something really efficient, 1800W is ideal. It's not always a case of the higher the number, the better the dryer, though: other design elements will also play into how effective it is, and different hair types might suit cooler or lower speeds (too much heat will damage hair, in any case).\nHow we tested these hair dryers\nTo test the products we've featured in this best hair dryers guide we take in to account the speed settings, temperature settings and how well they blow dry hair. We also monitored the sound level, and factored in how comfortable and balanced they were to use. We also considered cable length, and handy features like hanging loops, cord storage, and even cool shot buttons.\nOur review panel all have different hair types so to compare the hair dryers we access the specifications and review verdicts to ensure they are ordered correctly in this guide.\nMeet our reviewers\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nVicky is TechRadar's go-to beauty reviewer, and has reviewed dozens of hair dryers, straighteners and multi-stylers over the years.

      "text": "I tried Dreame's new AirStyle Pro and was blown away by how quickly this Dyson Airwrap alternative gave me curls\nDreame's hair styling tool gets a stylish upgrade\nWe've had a chance to test this styler out properly \u2013 head to our Dreame AirStyle Pro review to find out how we got on.\nIt was near impossible to ignore Dreame at CES 2025, not least because its new lineup of hair care gadgets looked so stylish leaning against the accompanying brown leather carrying bags. Even more excitingly, Dreame\u2019s new line-up featured the upgraded model of its Airstyle multi-styler that's set to rival the best Dyson Airwrap dupes.\nWe covered all of the latest CES news from the show as it happened. Stick with us to see the big stories on everything from 8K TVs and foldable displays to new phones, laptops, smart home gadgets, and the latest in AI.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to follow us on TikTok to get a behind-the-scenes look at the CES show floor!\nThe appliance maker's news about the Airstyle Pro was somewhat overshadowed, though. After all, this hair styling gadget doesn't have mechanical legs like Dreame's newest robovac that can climb stairs (although, adding a mechanical arm to the Airstyle that can also braid your hair like those quirky hair tools from the 90s would be a fun throwback feature).\nThat's not to say it isn't an iterative upgrade on the baseline Airstyler product, though, which launched in a number of APAC regions last year but didn't make it over to the US or UK. That's set to change with the Airstyle Pro series, as Dreame says it will debut its multi-styler in the US in a few months time.\nNot familiar with all-in-one hair stylising gadgets like the infamous Dyson Airwrap? The multi-styler and hair dryer multi-tool set a new standard for the appliance when it launched in 2018, paving the way for a slew of copy cats that were welcome rivals for consumers that wanted a cheaper alternative. After all, Dyson's Airwrap is rather costly, retailing for around $549.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$799.99 since launch and only seeing discounts a few times a year.\nThe new Dreame Airstyle Pro I got to see, by comparison, is more affordable (though still costly) at $399 / \u00a3320 / AU$630. Although when you weigh up its benefits, including it being great for less damaged hair, thanks to the fact that it uses air rather heat to style, it\u2019s a small price to pay.\nWhat's new with the Airstyle Pro?\nThere look to be two main improvements that Dreame has made to the Airstyle Pro versus the original device released last year, the biggest being the additional two attachments, upgrading it from a five-in-one hair drying and styling tool to a to seven-in-one. Alongside the usual accessories for different styling finishes, including the auto wrap barrel for small-sized curls, round volumizing brush for large-sized curls and blowouts, smoothing brush for taming frizz, fast dryer for blowdrying and flyway attachment for evening out your hair, there\u2019s now two more sized brushes for even more variety.\nI didn\u2019t try out these two new styling tools during my visit to Dreame\u2019s booth at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, but I did get to test out the auto wrap barrel. For context, I\u2019m not someone who styles my hair very often, but I was massively surprised at how intuitive and easy this tool was to use. The Airstyle Pro uses the same technology as the Airwrap, which leverages the aerodynamic phenomenon known as the Coanda effect to channel a powerful jet of air along an adjacent surface when under the right speed and pressure.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhat that translated into was me simply holding the device up to a piece of my type 1 (i.e. straight) hair that I had separated and then instantly letting going of it as my hair wrapped around the Airstyle Pro's auto wrap barrel. After only holding it for about 10 seconds, I pulled my hair away to find a new curl in its place. The whole experience was near-instant and felt effortless; I didn\u2019t have to readjust the hair strip or try holding the tool in a certain way to get fantastic results.\nThe last new upgrade that Dreame has made to the Airstyle Pro is one you can\u2019t miss \u2013 it\u2019s what gives it that \u2018Pro\u2019 look and feel that somewhat justifies a higher price tag for those that like premium looking gadgets. The stylish new \u2018leather-coated\u2019 finish is extremely eye-catching and has been added to the handle as well as the matching carry case.\nI'd even go as far to say that I like the textured finish more than the chrome handle that the Airwrap has, because it looks like it will offer more grip and comfort, which is crucial when trying to tame your hair or switch between attachments for different finishes.\nIf the Airstyle Pro has caught your eye as much as it has mine that we don\u2019t have too much longer to wait, with Dreame promising it be released in May. While we haven't yet fully tested out all of its new features, the Dreame Airstyle Pro does tick a lot of boxes when compared to the best hair styler tools, so make sure to check back to see how it fares once we've had a chance to put it through its paces.\nYou might also like\nAmelia became the Senior Editor for Home Entertainment at TechRadar in the UK in April 2023.

      "text": "Dyson's next-gen Airwrap is smaller, lighter, and more powerful, but it's the new straightening attachment that really turned my head\nThe supreme multi-styler just got even better\n- New Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x is smaller and lighter but more powerful\n- Introduces attachment memory and a cool new straightener attachment\n- On sale on 8 July in the US, and 'September' in the UK\nDyson has launched a new version of its Airwrap, and it looks better than ever. The new Airwrap Co-anda 2x is smaller and lighter, but offers more air pressure and more power. The accessories have also been upgraded to amp up the styler's versatility.\nThere's now attachment recognition, and an all-new AirSmooth attachment that looks particularly interesting for those looking to create sleek, straight styles.\nI reviewed the Dyson Airwrap i.d. and rated it the best hair styler on the market. I haven't tested this one yet, but if I were a betting woman, I'd say Dyson is about to dethrone its own styler with the upgraded version.\nTo create that smaller and lighter build, the Airwrap Co-anda 2x has had its internal mechanics completely redesigned, with a new Hyperdymium 2 motor. Two cool facts about this motor are that it can spin nine times faster than an F1 car engine, and that the wire powering the motor is just 90 microns wide \u2013 which is as thin as a strand of human hair. It can apparently deliver twice the air pressure and 30% more power than the Airwrap i.d., without increasing noise levels, which should mean faster drying, more efficient hair wrapping, and sleeker straightening.\nYou're still getting the i.d.curl feature, which was such a game-changer on the Airwrap i.d. It enables you to launch a personalized curl sequence with the flick of a button. Here, the barrels can also apparently detect when hair is fully wrapped, and it's time to start the i.d. curl sequence.\nOverall, it looks like the gap between Dyson and other Airwrap-alikes is widening \u2013 today's best Airwrap dupes can't even offer clockwise and anti-clockwise curls on the same barrel, let alone automating the entire process for you. However, I am slightly perturbed to see that Dyson seems to have redesigned the buttons here, swapping the Airwrap i.d.'s chunky, easy-to-use buttons for the fiddly, unnecessarily small switches found on the Dyson Supersonic r hair dryer.\nIt's all in the accessories\nAs I said up top, the accessories are where it's really at, so let's take a closer look at them. Previous versions of the Airwrap were mainly geared towards curling, but this latest iteration amps up the versatility and acts more like a true 'multi-styler'.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFirstly, the attachments now contain RFID sensors that enable the dryer part to recognize which one is clipped on. Then it'll automatically adjust to the optimal temperature and windspeed settings (the first time) or your last-used settings (thereafter) with each attachment. It's precisely the same as on the Supersonic Nural and Supersonic r hair dryers, where I found it massively helped to streamline the styling process, making it easier than ever to swap between tools.\nSecond, there's a new attachment geared specifically towards straightening: the AirSmooth2x, which looks like it's been inspired by the wet-to-dry Dyson Airstrait. Two unheated plates clamp together and blast the hair between them with air, with the tension helping smooth and straighten the strands as they dry. The plates will automatically unclamp once you reach the bottom of the hair.\nDyson says the Airwrap Co-anda 2x is the only multi-styler on the market to come with six attachments included with purchase. I'm not sure that's true, but there is certainly a more comprehensive range than you'd usually get.\nThere are two bundles to choose from, with different attachments to suit different hair types:\nStraight + Wavy bundle:\n- 30mm curling barrel\n- 40mm curling barrel\n- Anti-snag loop brush\n- Round volumizing brush\n- AirSmooth attachment\n- Fast dryer\nCurly + Coily bundle:\n- 40mm Co-anda curling barrel\n- Anti-snag loop brush\n- Round volumizing brush\n- Tension comb\n- Wave+Curl diffuser\n- Fast dryer\nYou can pick up most of the attachments individually if the one you want isn't included in your chosen bundle. Also available individually is a 20mm barrel for tighter curls (interestingly, Dyson seems to have already done away with the tapering barrel it introduced with the Airwrap i.d.).\n\u201cTraditional stylers can damage hair, but we have always focused on developing tools that protect hair health whilst enhancing without compromising precision and/or performance,\" comments brand founder James Dyson. \"We harness our expertise in motors, fluid dynamics, and materials to continually improve... It\u2019s about creating exciting long-lasting styles using smarter, more efficient technology.\"\nPrice & availability\nThe Co-anda 2x is actually already available in some international markets, including Korea. However, it was unveiled in the US and UK today (July 1). Both markets will offer the styler in Ceramic Pink or Jasper Plum, and the option of Straight+Wavy or Curly+Coily bundles (priced the same).\nIt will go on sale in the US from July 8 at Dyson.com and Sephora.com for $699.99. For comparison, the i.d. has a list price of $599.99.\nUK shoppers will have a bit longer to wait: the Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x will go on sale in September with a list price of \u00a3579.99 (compared to \u00a3479.99 for the i.d.).\nYou might also like...\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

  "argos_summary": "The Dreame AirStyle Pro is a promising multi-styler that competes with the Dyson Airwrap, featuring a stylish design and a variety of attachments, including auto-wrap curl barrels. However, it falls short due to its insufficient heat settings, which struggle to dry hair effectively, and attachments that do not secure firmly, leading to potential mishaps during styling. While it offers a premium feel and comfort, the performance issues make it hard to recommend over similarly priced alternatives like the Shark FlexStyle.",
