      "feedback": "Your draft is a good starting point but falls short of world‑class rigor in several key areas. First, the causal chain is too vague: you claim BOJ’s tight labor market “fuels wage growth that supports consumer spending and boosts earnings for small‑cap firms” but never quantify wage growth (e.g., 0.5 % YoY in Japan’s wage index) or link it to specific small‑cap earnings data (e.g., Q1 2025 EPS growth of 12 % for the Russell 2000). Second, the analysis mixes four unrelated themes (BOJ policy, UAS job growth, Russell 2000 valuation, Barista FIRE) without a clear integration; you need a single, coherent narrative or a table that shows how each factor feeds into the others. Third, you cite sources only in parentheses but never embed the IDs in the text (e.g., “(A7VLN74BK)” should appear as a footnote or inline citation). Fourth, you lack a structured scenario map: a base case, at least two alternatives, explicit timing windows (e.g., “BOJ policy shift by Q3 2025”), and a watch‑list of signals (e.g., “BOJ policy statement, UAS contract announcements, small‑cap earnings releases”). Fifth, you miss key quantitative anchors: the 97 % UAS job growth (FOM34PUWA) should be paired with the 2025 average salary of $105,912; the Russell 2000’s valuation discount (e.g., 1.2× P/E vs. S&P 500) and the percentage of negative‑earning firms (≈30 % per Q7VVGNSQE). Sixth, you do not reconcile conflicting data (e.g., AUVSI’s defunct projections vs. EDC’s 97 % rise). Finally, confidence ratings are absent; add a 1–5 scale with justification. To upgrade, rewrite the analysis as a concise, bullet‑pointed scenario map, embed inline citations with IDs, quantify every claim, and explicitly tie each macro driver to the small‑cap valuation outcome. This will satisfy depth, clarity, first‑principles grounding, and citation density requirements.",
