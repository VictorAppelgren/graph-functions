  "description": "A grand jury cleared Bond of the sexual assault accusations levied against him just weeks before the 2025 NFL Draft.",
  "content": "The Collin County grand jury has cleared former Texas Longhorns wide receiver Isaiah Bond of the sexual assault accusations levied against him just weeks before the NFL Draft.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing all the evidence presented, a Collin County grand jury returned a \u2018no bill\u2019 in the sexual assault charge involving Isaiah Bond, meaning no indictment will be issued,\u201d Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said in a statement to CBS News Texas. \u201cThis concludes the criminal proceedings in this matter.\u201d\n\nBond released a statement on X, distancing himself from the allegations.\n\n\u201cI know there have been questions and reports about the recent allegations,\u201d Bond said. \u201cI am grateful for the decision of the prosecutor and the courts not to pursue charges. I will learn from this experience as I grow in wisdom, character and faith. On the advice of my attorney, I will not discuss the details of this case, but I want to be clear: from the very beginning, I have refuted these allegations and maintained my innocence. I stand firm by that today.\u201d\n\nIn the same statement, Bond also announced that the Cleveland Browns were allowing him \u201cthe opportunity to continue my career in the NFL.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Cleveland Browns for believing in me and allowing me the opportunity to continue my career in the NFL,\u201d Bond said. \u201cFootball has been my passion since I was 6 years old, and playing at this level is a blessing I will never take for granted. I understand that playing in the NFL is a privilege, and I\u2019m thankful every day to live my childhood dream \u2026 I am determined to prove the Browns organization and everyone who believes in me right for putting their trust in me.\u201d\n\n\n\n According to a report from ESPN, no deal has been finalized between Bond and the Browns.\n\nBond played two seasons at the University of Alabama before transferring to Texas for one season, upon the retirement of former Alabama head coach Nick Saban. In 14 games for the Longhorns in 2024, Bond had 34 catches for 540 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nBond was No. 201 on Dane Brugler\u2019s draft big board and was regarded as a potential Day 2 pick. However, Bond turned himself in to the authorities on April 10 after an arrest warrant was issued by the Frisco Police Department for sexual assault.",

      "text": "Grand jury clears ex-UT receiver Isaiah Bond in sexual assault case\nFormer University of Texas wide receiver Isaiah Bond has been cleared of a sexual assault charge after a Collin County grand jury returned a \"no bill,\" meaning no indictment will be issued.\nBond, 21, was arrested in April following an encounter with a woman who alleged the interaction was non-consensual. The case cast a shadow over Bond's NFL prospects, and he went undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft as teams weighed the pending criminal investigation.\nNFL future opens up\nWith the grand jury's decision, Bond is now eligible to sign with an NFL team as a free agent.\nBond's attorney, Toby Shook, said he was \"gratified\" by the outcome and emphasized that his client had maintained his innocence throughout the process.\nIn a statement provided to CBS News Texas, Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said:\n\"After reviewing all the evidence presented, a Collin County grand jury returned a 'no bill' in the sexual assault charge involving Isaiah Bond, meaning no indictment will be issued. This concludes the criminal proceedings in this matter.\"\nArrest and legal response\nBond turned himself in to Frisco police on April 10 on an outstanding sexual assault warrant. He posted a $25,000 bond and was released from custody. Less than a week later, Bond and his legal team filed a now-dismissed federal lawsuit against the unnamed woman, claiming the encounter was consensual.\nAllegations and counterclaims\nThe alleged victim stated that she and Bond met on Feb. 4 in what began as a consensual encounter before Bond committed non-consensual acts. She also alleged that Bond asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement and later offered her money in a text message apology.\nTexas, Alabama stats highlight potential\nBond played three seasons of college football \u2014 two at Alabama and one at Texas \u2014 appearing in 41 games. He totaled 99 receptions for 1,428 yards and 10 receiving touchdowns, averaging 14.4 yards per catch. He also added 101 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown, finishing with 1,529 total yards from scrimmage and 11 touchdowns overall."

      "text": "Scouting is a very subjective process, especially when not evaluating for a specific scheme or culture fit. So, I don\u2019t expect this top 300 to play out exactly like the real thing on draft weekend \u2014 but the idea is to put prospects in the right neighborhood, close to where they\u2019ll be selected.\nEven that is a challenge, though, with so many wild cards in this class. For example, some teams see Ohio State\u2019s Jack Sawyer as a second-round player, while others have stamped him with a fifth-round grade. Texas safety Andrew Mukuba is a top-75 prospect for some and a sixth-rounder for others. And I won\u2019t touch on the wild grades from team to team when it comes to the quarterbacks.\nHere is my top 300 for the 2025 NFL Draft:\nTravis Hunter\nHunter has the twitchy, skilled talent and competitive mentality to be an impact wide receiver and/or cornerback at the next level. NFL teams are split on his role \u2014 and on the possibility of Hunter playing both ways, because of durability concerns. But he is both CB1 and WR1 in this class and will give his next coaching staff exciting options.\nAbdul Carter\nCarter is a disruptive presence, because of his explosive nature and how he mixes up his rushes to win with speed, force and a budding arsenal of moves. He projects as a 1A pass rusher, with a gift for consistently making the quarterback move his feet and making plays in the run game.\nAshton Jeanty\nJeanty displays exceptional contact balance, run instincts and versatility in the passing game, reminiscent of LaDainian Tomlinson. He has the talent to emerge as a high-level running back early in his NFL career.\nMason Graham\nGraham is a leverage monster and skillfully destroys blocks with his strength, quickness, motor and play recognition to make an impact versus both pass and run. He projects as a versatile interior presence with the floor of an NFL starter.\nJalon Walker\nWalker doesn\u2019t have elite size for edge work, but he is at his best using his long, sleek athleticism to explode downhill and close at the top of his rush to affect the quarterback. There is projection involved with his evaluation, but his pass-rush upside and overall versatility make him one of the best talents in the class.\nWill Campbell\nCampbell\u2019s mediocre arm length lessens his margin for error, but his athletic movements, core strength and competitive finish help him stay connected through the whistle, regardless of the block required. His skill set is reminiscent of a more powerful version of Colts left tackle Bernhard Raimann, although some NFL teams project him best as an interior blocker.\nArmand Membou\nMembou might not have ideal height for tackle, but he plays long with exceptional control and finishing skills. His tools remind me of Troy Fautanu from the 2024 draft class, and all the talent is there for him to become a long-term NFL starting tackle.\nTyler Warren\nWarren still has developing to do as a route runner and blocker, but he is an agile-footed big man who naturally tracks the football with dependable hands and a hunger to create after the catch. He projects as a rookie NFL starter with traditional qualities, as well as the schematic versatility to be a multi-tool weapon for a play caller.\nShemar Stewart\nStewart needs to mature his rush efficiency and finishing skills, but he has a rare combination of talent and motor to be a game-wrecker against both the pass and the run. His best football is ahead of him.\nMike Green\nGreen is a twitchy athlete with the burst and body control to win one-on-one as a pass rusher and set a violent edge in the run game. As long as his character checks out, he is one of the top pass-rush prospects in the draft class, with the disruptive ability to be an NFL starter.\nColston Loveland\nLoveland doesn\u2019t have the skill set for full-time inline responsibilities, but his dynamic movements, natural hands and football awareness should make him one of the primary targets in an NFL offense. His tools and upside are reminiscent of Zach Ertz.\nTetairoa McMillan\nMcMillan is only average in the speed and separation categories, but he is a long and limber athlete with exceptional tracking and ball-winning instincts. He fits the Tee Higgins mold as a unique playmaker, because of his size and catch-point skills.\nCam Ward\nWard must button up his drifting footwork and cut down on the reckless habits, but he is a loose, instinctive passer who can rip accurate strikes with a natural rhythm to his play. With his talent and intangibles, he projects as an NFL starter in the mold of a taller, slower version of Kyler Murray.\nJihaad Campbell\nCampbell is an explosive, physical athlete with the developing instincts to impact the game as a run defender, cover man and blitzer from various angles and depths (some teams like him best as a full-time edge rusher). He is a first-round talent, although the medical feedback will be crucial for his final grade.\nMatthew Golden\nIt might bother some teams that he doesn\u2019t have better size, but Golden also doesn\u2019t have any glaring flaws to his game that would keep him from becoming a productive pro. He can play inside or outside and become the go-to target for an NFL offense.\nDerrick Harmon\nHarmon is a highly active and disruptive big man who consistently finds ways to gain freedom from blocks as a penetrating pass rusher and run stuffer. He projects as a scheme-diverse NFL starter, anywhere from one- to five-tech.\nNick Emmanwori\nEmmanwori has the size, speed and mindset to play a variety of roles, although he projects best near the line of scrimmage, where he can blitz, be an eraser against the run and man up with tight ends and backs in coverage. He has the floor of an adequate starter and special-teamer, but his ceiling is exciting and will put him high on NFL teams\u2019 safety stack.\nWill Johnson\nJohnson is more \u201cgood\u201d than \u201cgreat\u201d in terms of twitch and speed, but he has outstanding eyes, feet and coverage IQ to match and make plays on the football. He projects as a day one starting outside cornerback in the NFL.\nMalaki Starks\nStarks doesn\u2019t have Teflon tape, especially in man coverage, but his athletic profile, diagnose skills and intangibles will make him an immediate starter and special-teamer in the NFL. His versatile skill set can give a defensive coordinator options, although he is best suited for a free safety role.\nJosh Simmons\nSimmons is a nimble, coordinated pass protector with tremendous athletic poise and the body control to be a long-term starting left tackle in the NFL. His pro projection hinges on medical feedback.\nMykel Williams\nWilliams is more toolsy than nuanced and needs to develop a more unified pass-rush plan. The individual traits (length, strength, explosiveness), promising toughness and football character, however, are reasons to bet on his upside. Similar in ways to Jason Pierre-Paul, he projects as an NFL starter on the edge.\nDonovan Ezeiruaku\nEzeiruaku is a tad light for a stack-and-shed edge setter. But rushing the passer is his calling card, and he has the arc acceleration, body flexibility and long, active arms to break down the balance of blockers. He has NFL starter-level talent, and his tape says he is more than a DPR (designated pass rusher).\nJosh Conerly Jr.\nConerly must continue refining his hands and core strength, but he is on the right trajectory and enters the NFL with a promising foundation based on athletic movements and body control. Currently a \u201cbend, don\u2019t break\u201d blocker, he has the talent to become a solid starter early in his NFL career.\nTyler Booker\nBooker is built like a bull, with the play strength and finishing mentality to match. His average foot quickness, however, might not be ideal for every scheme. He projects as an immediate starting guard with the tools and competitive character that are easy to bet on.\nKenneth Grant\nGrant plays big in a big man\u2019s game, but he also has the athletic traits and effort to grow into more than just a stout run stopper. He projects as an early-down NFL starter with three-down upside.\nKelvin Banks Jr.\nBanks doesn\u2019t have ideal length and needs to improve his sustain tactics to be a consistent finisher against NFL talent, but he has controlled footwork and depth in his pass sets, plus the fundamental know-how to fit and leverage blocks and keep defenders occupied. He projects as an immediate NFL starter who can stay at tackle, although his best long-term position might be guard.\nLuther Burden III\nBurden is still working on his undergrad degree in route setup and separation, but he holds a master\u2019s in creating with the ball in his hands, because of his explosive speed and competitive toughness. For an NFL team targeting a YAC weapon with upside to be more, he will be an appealing option early.\nEmeka Egbuka\nEgbuka is a very quarterback-friendly target \u2014 not because he is bigger, stronger or faster than defenders, but because he understands detailed subtleties to uncover and command the catch point. Though he can line up outside, he would thrive in a Rashee Rice-like slot role, where he can expand a play-calling menu with his diverse skill set.\nOmarion Hampton\nHampton has only average creativity and is a tad tight in his hips and ankles, but he is a bruising runner with an effective blend of patience, power and speed. Given his reliability on passing downs, he is a complete player and should start as an NFL rookie.\nJahdae Barron\nBarron doesn\u2019t have the top-tier size that most teams prioritize at the position, but he trusts his instincts and competes with the toughness and ball skills to hold up versus pass or run. Some teams view him as a nickel-only prospect, while others see his value to play multiple positions across the secondary.\nWalter Nolen\nNolen has areas of his game that require maturing, but he flashes big-time disruption in his initial burst and fast, physical hands to regularly affect the backfield action. He will be attractive for NFL teams looking for an active gap-shooter with high-end upside.\nGrey Zabel\nZabel must prove he can consistently anchor against NFL power, but his light, flexible movements and strong hands keep pass rushers busy and displace defenders in the run game. A college tackle, he projects best inside, at either center or guard, where he will compete for immediate starting reps and offer Pro Bowl upside.\nMason Taylor\nTaylor was Mr. Reliable in the LSU offense \u2014 and can be the same for an NFL team, because of his his good-sized athleticism, reliable ball skills and competitive blocking. He projects as a solid NFL starter who doesn\u2019t have to leave the field and has some similarities to Hunter Henry.\nShedeur Sanders\nSanders doesn\u2019t have the physical traits to get away with some of his decisions, but he is a poised, rhythmic passer when he stays true to his skill set, and he shows the necessary touch and confidence of an NFL starter. He fits best in a timing-based offense.\nMaxwell Hairston\nHairston is a competitive, lanky athlete who feels routes developing around him and plays with the reactionary movements and ball skills to fit a variety of coverages. If he makes the necessary improvements as a tackler, he has the talent to become a capable NFL starter early in his career.\nJames Pearce Jr.\nPearce is upright and frenetic in his play style, but his blend of explosiveness and power creates consistent disruption as a pass rusher. He shows promise in the run game, too. If he works to maximize his talent, he will be a productive pro.\nAireonate Ersery\nErsery has the size, strength and movement talent to become an NFL starting tackle \u2014 if his timing, angles and overall consistency continue to improve with pro coaching. It might be a bumpy ride early as he transitions to the next level.\nCarson Schwesinger\nSchwesinger is an easy player to appreciate, because he is a tractor beam to the ball, a consistent finisher as a tackler and always plays at full speed to close on plays in a blink. He has the instincts, demeanor and cover talent to be a four-down NFL starter early in his NFL career.\nTrey Amos\nAmos has an appetite for press, but I liked him best in zone (Cover 2, Cover 3, quarters), where he can trust his athletic instincts from depth to read and rally. His super-senior season convinced evaluators that he is a pro starter, similar in ways to Paulson Adebo.\nTyleik Williams\nWilliams needs further development as a pass rusher, but he is one of the best run-defending linemen in the draft class because of his recognition skills and disciplined execution at deconstructing blocks. He has the type of skill set that will be appreciated by NFL coaches.\nElijah Arroyo\nArroyo needs further development as a route runner and blocker to reach his ceiling, but he can bring an immediate vertical element to an offense with his speed, fluidity and focused ball skills. He is easy to project as an NFL starter and a weapon for which defenses must account.\nJaylin Noel\nNoel is a smaller target but very quarterback-friendly, because of the confidence he has in his hands and his athletic versatility, which makes him tough to cover. His scouting report and college tape give flashbacks to those of Christian Kirk when he was an NFL Draft prospect. Noel can have a similar pro career.\nJT Tuimoloau\nOverall, Tuimoloau\u2019s college tape is more good than exceptional, but he is competitive, skilled and doesn\u2019t have major deficiencies that would keep him from being a dependable edge presence in the NFL. He is one of the most well-rounded defensive prospects in the class.\nKaleb Johnson\nJohnson isn\u2019t a dynamic make-you-miss athlete, but he is a patient and powerful one-cut runner with the instinctive vision to crease the defense using run angles and foot quickness. His play style is reminiscent of DeMarco Murray with a three-down skill set to thrive in a zone-based NFL scheme.\nJayden Higgins\nHiggins is an ascending height-weight-speed athlete with the physicality and catch radius to be a productive NFL starter as he continues developing his route/release precision. His game is similar to what Nico Collins put on tape at Michigan.\nTreVeyon Henderson\nHenderson isn\u2019t a proven bellcow between the tackles, but his bursts of speed make him a home-run threat and coaches can trust him to execute without the football. His versatile skill set will be an immediate upgrade to an NFL backfield.\nLandon Jackson\nJackson has a different type of pass-rushing skill set because he isn\u2019t a super-fluid athlete, but his raw power, strength in his hands and consistent effort make him effective. He should be expected to compete for starter-level snaps as a rookie.\nDonovan Jackson\nJackson\u2019s sustain and recovery hiccups must be addressed by an NFL coaching staff, but his athletic traits and play strength should translate well to the next level. He projects as an NFL starter, and his tape shows a player with true tackle-guard versatility.\nJaxson Dart\nDart needs time to develop his progression-based reads and anticipation (things he wasn\u2019t asked to regularly do in college), but he is a natural thrower of the football with promising mobility and high-level competitive intangibles. If allowed to develop at his own pace, he offers NFL starting upside in the right situation.\nTyler Shough\nShough is overaged and needs to cut back on some of the high-risk passing decisions, but he is a gifted thrower with the functional mobility to work off schedule. He has the tools to work his way up a depth chart and make plays once on the field.\nAzareye'h Thomas\nThomas isn\u2019t the most sudden or button-upped cover man, but he consistently crowds receivers on the outside with his size, fluidity and competitiveness. He has NFL-starting tools, and his play style is very similar to that of Carlton Davis.\nJordan Burch\nBurch is a smooth edge rusher in a defensive tackle\u2019s frame. He probably will never be a star in the league, but he has high-floor talent with his NFL size, power and movements. He projects as a scheme-versatile base end, and it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if he has a similar NFL trajectory to that of John Franklin-Myers.\nTate Ratledge\nRatledge is a self-described \u201cdirtbag\u201d with the contact power, competitive edge and functional movement skills to match up against NFL defensive linemen. He should compete for a starting role as a rookie and has the necessary tools for a decade-long pro career, if he stays healthy.\nXavier Watts\nWatts isn\u2019t a safety you want playing man-to-man coverage against slot receivers very often, but he is a solid run defender with the route anticipation and ball skills to sniff out plays from depth. He projects as an NFL starter and would fit best in a split-safety, zone-heavy scheme, in which he can play two-deep and underneath zone.\nJonah Savaiinaea\nSavaiinaea has the length and functional movements to stay at tackle, but his square play style projects best inside at guard, where he can use his bear claws to control the man in front of him. He should compete for starting reps as early as his rookie season.\nShemar Turner\nTurner needs to introduce more discipline to his play style, but he prides himself on being the aggressor and relies on his initial twitch, fierce hands and combative mentality to be a factor. He projects best as a penetrating one-gap tackle.\nJared Wilson\nWilson lacks premium size and is fundamentally rough around the edges, but he sports the body control, movement skills and football IQ to lock down a long-term starting center role. His game is reminiscent of Rodney Hudson\u2019s, and he should compete for immediate starting reps.\nJack Sawyer\nSawyer often plays one-dimensionally as a pass rusher and lacks ideal suddenness or length for an edge player, but his activity level and the strength in his hands make him an every-down factor. Similar in ways to George Karlaftis, he has the competitive play personality that NFL coaches will welcome as part of their rotation.\nNic Scourton\nScourton is a banshee off the edge with the quickness and power to work half-a-man and wear down blockers. His game plan is overly reliant on effort and relatively basic, though, because of his average athletic tools. His aggressive worker-bee play style should translate to starting snaps in the NFL.\nQuinshon Judkins\nJudkins isn\u2019t as dynamic as other backs in this class, but he is an \u201cattitude\u201d runner with the quickness, vision and violence to be a productive lead option in an NFL backfield. He can help secure his spot on the depth chart by taking his passing-down responsibilities from serviceable to above average.\nDarius Alexander\nAlexander isn\u2019t yet the full sum of his impressive parts, but his blend of power, length and athletic body control give him the makings of a three-down, scheme-versatile NFL starter. He projects best in an attacking role, where he\u2019d be able to maximize his disruptive traits. His peak plays are reminiscent of Leonard Williams.\nShavon Revel Jr.\nHis durability will be questioned, understandably, but Revel is a boundary bully with terrific speed, length and ball-tracking skills. He has the talent of an NFL starter.\nJalen Royals\nRoyals combines smooth footwork with athletic body control, physical play strength and tracking skills to be a three-level threat as he expands his route tree. He has the talent to emerge as a team\u2019s WR2 within his first few NFL seasons.\nOluwafemi Oladejo\nOladejo offers pass-rush upside as he continues to evolve his attack plan and arsenal of moves, but he has the disruptive qualities \u2014 his power and effort \u2014 to see immediate NFL snaps. He has three-down potential, although convincing NFL teams that he is coachable enough to reach his ceiling will be key for him throughout the draft process.\nTre Harris\nHarris doesn\u2019t have the explosive speed or separation skills that teams covet in a No. 1 receiver, but he is a controlled athlete with the play strength and ball skills to be a dependable possession target. He projects as an NFL starter and a team\u2019s No. 2 target \u2014 if he can stay healthy.\nNohl Williams\nWilliams will need to prove he can overcome his average long speed against NFL competition, but there are far more pros than cons to his game, including his awareness, ball skills and physical play demeanor. I think he\u2019ll stay at cornerback, but his game is reminiscent of another former Cal corner, Cam Bynum, who has found NFL success at safety.\nJacob Parrish\nParrish is still developing his discipline at the position, but he is a fluid mover with the speed and compete skills that are the foundation of a promising cornerback. He offers inside-out versatility and starting upside.\nAlfred Collins\nCollins is still learning how to maximize his size and talent, but he took a sizable jump this past season and shows the physical traits to be a disruptive force, especially against the run. He will provide immediate depth as a rookie, and his snap count should increase with experience.\nBenjamin Morrison\nPlay strength and durability concerns will follow him to the next level, but Morrison is an athletic, technically-sound cover man who works hard to stay attached to routes and make plays on the ball. As long as he stays healthy, he is a scheme-versatile NFL starter.\nT.J. Sanders\nSanders is a long, twitchy big man and has the tools to make consistent plays in the backfield with continued technical and awareness improvements. His promising skill set will fit both even and odd fronts.\nPrincely Umanmielen\nUmanmielen won\u2019t easily dismantle NFL tackles or tight ends at the point of attack, but his edge speed, body control and flexibility make him a dangerous two-way pass rusher. All the tools are there for him to become a productive designated pass rusher in the NFL.\nJack Bech\nBech\u2019s acceleration is more build-up than immediate, and he will need to prove himself versus NFL press coverage, but he is urgent as a route runner with the ball-winning skills and competitive personality that will play. He has experience both inside and outside, and his play style is reminiscent of Puka Nacua.\nJalen Milroe\nMilroe is unpolished as a passer, both physically and mentally, but he is a dynamic athlete with a unique blend of speed, arm strength and intelligence, making him an intriguing developmental option for a patient coaching staff. His upside is tough to measure, but it is higher considering he has the tools to switch positions if his time at quarterback doesn\u2019t pan out.\nDylan Sampson\nSampson is undersized by NFL standards and his inconsistent tempo gets him in trouble, but he is equal parts fast, physical and slippery as a runner and shows promise as a pass catcher. He can have a Tony Pollard-like impact for an NFL backfield.\nTerrance Ferguson\nThere isn\u2019t much about his game that screams \u201cexceptional,\u201d but Ferguson is solid across the board and should continue to ascend as he adds consistency to his blocking and patterns. He has the foundational traits to carve out an NFL career similar to that of Jake Ferguson (no relation).\nJoshua Farmer\nFarmer goes through too many quiet stretches on film, but he is a force creator with his natural power as a two-gapper and promising pass-rush tools. He should step into a rotation as a rookie and has the potential of a full-time starter.\nJordan James\nJames\u2019 well-rounded, no-nonsense run style will translate well to the NFL game, as will his feel for maximizing runs at the line of scrimmage and making the first man miss, which he does in multiple different ways (power, balance, quickness, vision). He has the talent to quickly ascend to the top of a team\u2019s running back depth chart \u2014 and stay there.\nAshton Gillotte\nGillotte is a densely built edge defender who might not check every box but is consistently in the sack area and plays fast, physical and persistent \u2014 three qualities that will endear him to NFL coaches. He can be an immediate sub-package rusher with long-term starting potential.\nOzzy Trapilo\nTrapilo is a towering athlete and can be jarred at contact on occasion, but he has swing-tackle traits with his smooth weight distribution and the impressive strike timing he uses to consistently complete the mission. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see him compete for starting right tackle reps as a rookie.\nJosaiah Stewart\nStewart\u2019s size won\u2019t be for everyone, but he is an energetic athlete whose combination of twitchy get-off, crafty hands and relentless finish can make him a pass-rush factor from day one. His talent suggests he can be more than a pass-rush specialist in the NFL.\nMiles Frazier\nFrazier has an NFL body with mauling play strength and competitive toughness, which gives him starting potential \u2014 if he can find improved consistency to mask his average athleticism. He best fits teams that prioritize size and mass.\nHarold Fannin Jr.\nFannin is somewhat of an unconventional prospect. He is awkwardly athletic with stiff, restricting movements, but he plays with straight-line explosiveness, outstanding tracking skills and threatening run-after-catch ability. He fits best as a hybrid H or F tight end and offers three-down potential.\nKevin Winston Jr.\nWinston is still green in the way he diagnoses play development, but the tools are there for him to eventually become a quality NFL starter \u2014 if he\u2019s given a specific role and allowed to grow into the scheme. Rust should be expected during his rookie season.\nMarcus Mbow\nMbow needs to continue developing his play strength and consistency through contact, but his athletic body control and skilled hands are the foundation of a player who will compete for NFL starting snaps, be it at tackle or inside at guard or center. His play style and potential are reminiscent of Zach Tom.\nBilly Bowman Jr.\nBowman falls short in the size and strength categories, but he is among the best safeties in this class in terms of football IQ, movement skills and competitive urgency. His disruptive versatility on the backend will force teams to consider how much they are willing to compromise on desired size.\nQuinn Ewers\nEwers has the arm, intelligence and poise that will translate to the next level, although his up-and-down decision-making, limitations as a play extender and durability concerns create question marks for his pro ceiling. If he stays healthy, the tools are there to compete for NFL starting reps.\nDanny Stutsman\nStutsman doesn\u2019t have the proven coverage talent required of modern-day linebackers, but he is a gap-sound run defender and thundering tackler with the swagger (on and off the field) that will be welcome in the NFL. He will start early in his NFL career, because of his ability working downhill, although his development when working in reverse will determine his pro ceiling.\nCharles Grant\nGrant is a nimble big man with outstanding range, length and movement twitch, but he needs to develop better patience and muscle mass to match up with NFL competition. He has the traits of a future NFL starter and projects best in a zone-heavy offense, similar in ways to Spencer Burford.\nElic Ayomanor\nAyomanor lacks natural refinement but can be a matchup weapon. He is a large, physical target for the quarterback with a sizable catch radius and the ability to challenge vertically. He has yet to play his best football.\nKyle Williams\nWilliams might not stand out with his size or play strength, but he compensates for that with his ability to accelerate to top gear rapidly and create catchable windows for his quarterback. With more seasoning, he can become a WR2/3 for an NFL offense.\nTy Hamilton\nHamilton needs pass-rush development, but he is quick, forceful and urgent to create disruption within the structure of the defense. His coachable attitude and positional versatility raise his NFL floor as a role player and potential starter.\nRJ Harvey\nHarvey needs to develop better consistency on passing downs, but he is skilled at patiently settling his feet and changing lanes with his instinctive field vision and lateral quickness. Similar in ways to Tyjae Spears, he projects best in a timeshare role in the NFL.\nAnthony Belton\nBelton uses his size and length to keep the game on his terms, staying centered and forcing defenders to try to go through him. When he is unable to do that, his body control and footwork break down quickly, which needs to be further addressed by NFL coaching. With improved consistency, he has the tools to get on the field and contribute.\nQuincy Riley\nRiley will need to prove that he won\u2019t be a liability against NFL size and strength, but he has the requisite speed and nose for the football to carry vertical routes and challenge catch points. He projects as an immediate contributor (zone or man) with the upside to ascend to starter-level snaps.\nGunnar Helm\nHelm will need time to adjust to NFL physicality as a blocker, but he has the toughness and pass-catching talent to potentially become a three-down player. His tape shows a possible mismatch weapon, but his lackluster combine performance will give NFL teams pause.\nTrevor Etienne\nThere might not be anything exceptional about Etienne\u2019s game, but he also doesn\u2019t have any glaring weaknesses that would keep him from seeing steady NFL snaps. His promise as a pass catcher and blocker gives him value on all three downs.\nJonas Sanker\nSanker will be well-liked by NFL coaches because of his natural athleticism, competitive urgency and intangibles, as well as his strong special teams profile. He projects best as an instinctive box safety.\nJeffrey Bassa\nBassa (who wore the green dot for the Ducks in 2024) needs to turn the \u201calmost\u201d plays into more steady production, but he does everything well on the football field and can become an NFL starter with improved consistency. His football arrow is pointing up.\nBradyn Swinson\nSwinson is a green high-side rusher with the athletic tools to threaten the edge and chase down the football. It might be tough for him to sustain three-down responsibilities until he can set a more firm edge, though. He is best suited for a stand-up reserve role on passing downs in a 3-4 scheme.\nBarryn Sorrell\nSorrell passes the eye test and the foundation of his game is power, which sets up different ways for him to win, although his average short-area athleticism might limit the frequency of those wins against NFL blockers. His makeup and motor will give him a chance to carve out a role in a 4-3 scheme.\nDylan Fairchild\nFairchild lacks experience \u2014 and it shows at times \u2014 but he is powerful, tough and naturally aggressive. I expect him to continue getting better with additional reps. He is an ascending prospect with NFL starting upside, in the Wyatt Teller mold.\nTory Horton\nHorton must tighten his route running and get stronger, but his fluidity, speed and natural tracking skills can be weaponized by the right coaching staff. He projects as a rotational Z receiver/punt returner who can gradually push for starting flanker reps.\nSai'vion Jones\nJones needs continued schooling with his hands and pad level, but he plays long, strong and persistent as a downhill force player against both pass and run. He hasn\u2019t yet reached his football ceiling and has the tools to become a solid depth piece on an NFL defensive line.\nSmael Mondon Jr.\nMondon needs to see things a half-beat faster to reach his full potential, but his athletic range and toughness give him upside as a four-down NFL linebacker. His health could be the main concern that keeps him from becoming an NFL starter.\nTy Robinson\nRobinson might lack star potential, but rugged competitors with his size, toughness and ability never go out of style in the NFL. He projects as a rotational defender who fits both even (one-technique) and odd (4i-/five-technique) fronts.\nDarien Porter\nPorter is a unique prospect that requires heavy projection because of his meager experience, but he has the rare combination of physical traits and promising ball skills to develop into an NFL starting corner. With rare size/speed and a wide receiver background, Riq Woolen is the natural NFL comparison \u2014 if Porter develops more of a competitive edge.\nWyatt Milum\nMilum has enough athletic tools and the processing ability to eventually compete for an NFL starting role, but his elevated pad level and average recovery skills are concerns. Despite being a tackle-only in college, his pro projection is inside at guard.\nBhayshul Tuten\nTuten is a balanced runner with the giddy-up burst to gash the defense when he finds the crease. His promise on third downs and experience as a kick returner increase the value he\u2019d hold on an NFL roster.\nAndrew Mukuba\nMukuba\u2019s lack of size will be more noticeable against NFL competition, both in coverage and run support, but he brings energy, instincts and play speed to the secondary. He has the mentality and talent to compete for a starting role at free safety.\nSeth McLaughlin\nMcLaughlin has some overaggressive tendencies and needs to continue improving his snap consistency, but he checks a lot of boxes of a starting NFL center with his body quickness, technical approach and intangibles. His medical grade will impact his final projection.\nJarquez Hunter\nHunter\u2019s vision and tempo tend to run hot and cold, but he is a hammerhead with downhill burst to run through holes and into contact without gearing down. Along with his hungry run style, his impact on special teams will separate him on an NFL depth chart.\nCam Skattebo\nSkattebo is a thickly built, compact runner who is more quick than explosive, but he competes with tremendous resolve and understands how to rely on his pad level and contact balance to get the most out of every carry. He is a draftable option for a team looking to upgrade its backfield physicality.\nLathan Ransom\nRansom might not have the coverage anticipation to be a true ball hawk, but he sees the field well to key quickly, run the alley and stay on top of everything. If he stays healthy, he has the run-defending range and matchup potential against tight ends to become an NFL starter.\nSavion Williams\nTCU leaned into Williams\u2019 unique athletic profile in 2024, and the manufactured touches showcased his ability to create with the ball. However, the move came out of necessity, because of Williams\u2019 inconsistencies as a traditional receiver. He projects as more of a \u201cjoker\u201d weapon and needs a creative play caller who can utilize him in different ways (similar to Cordarrelle Patterson).\nDJ Giddens\nGiddens is a narrow, upright runner and doesn\u2019t have a grind-it-out mentality, but his gliding quickness and innate balance help him create. He projects best in an NFL scheme with a play caller who can get him into space as part of a committee.\nJay Toia\nToia might not have the length or awareness to be a full-time two-gapper in the NFL, but he has a powerful base and physical hands to neutralize the point of attack. He projects as a scheme-versatile nose tackle.\nKyle McCord\nMcCord is average from a physical standpoint, and his lack of escapability limits his options, but he is a cool customer with the anticipation and conviction as a pocket passer to make plays when he has protection and capable talent around him. He projects as a backup option in the NFL, although there is starting potential there in the right situation.\nCam Jackson\nJackson has a shallow toolbox as a pass rusher, but he is a solid athlete for his size and a tough player to displace as a two-gapping run stuffer. Regardless of scheme, he offers value as an early-down NFL nose who can anchor and eat up blocks.\nOmarr Norman-Lott\nNorman-Lott is an explosive disruptor and offers high upside for a coaching staff that can harness his energy, although he will need to improve his undisciplined tendencies, especially in the run game. There is no doubt about his NFL talent, but his ability to handle more of a full-time role is a tricky projection.\nDemetrius Knight Jr.\nKnight won\u2019t be a true three-down player for some schemes, but he fits the bill for a defense seeking a fast, thumping run stuffer and blitzer with an old-school mentality. He has early-down starting potential and should see immediate reps on special teams.\nJordan Phillips\nPhillips is a dancing bear with big-man twitch and commanding power, but his immense talent needs to be unlocked by more mature timing and technique. Although he will need time, he has the traits and work ethic to become a rotational nose with the upside of an NFL starter.\nAeneas Peebles\nPeebles has an unconventional body type, which raises obvious concerns about his NFL transition, but he is a spirited pass rusher with serious juice and a diverse set of tactics to be disruptive. He projects as a rotational backup as a penetrating one-gapper who can carve out a role as a sub-down rusher.\nChris Paul Jr.\nPaul won\u2019t be a fit for NFL teams that have strict size thresholds at the position, but his \u201call-out\u201d play style will find a way to be productive at the next level. He should shine on special teams.\nJamaree Caldwell\nThe tape runs hot and cold for Caldwell, and he plays with a confused identity. However, he has an interesting collection of traits and put a little bit of everything on tape, which will make him appealing to different schemes. I like him best as a rotational one-technique who can stay on the field on passing downs.\nDorian Strong\nStrong doesn\u2019t have ideal foot speed or twitch for what some NFL teams desire, but he is a quick, instinctive player with the competitive profile other teams will highly value. He projects as a rookie reserve.\nChase Lundt\nLundt needs to continue developing his lower body to hold the point and answer NFL power, but he has the athletic movement traits that will be interesting for wide-zone teams. He projects as a potential swing tackle.\nDeone Walker\nWalker is a unique athlete with impressive balance and movement skills for a 330-plus-pounder, but his technique and pad level must catch up with his physical talent for the flashes to become consistent. If he adapts to pro coaching, he has the skill set to become an NFL starter.\nTyrion Ingram-Dawkins\nIngram-Dawkins doesn\u2019t have a strong body of work, but if you grade to the flashes and trust the size and athletic traits, it is easy to be excited about his pro potential. He offers inside-outside versatility \u2014 some NFL teams view him as more of an edge presence; others want his explosiveness over the B-gap.\nVernon Broughton\nBroughton has NFL size and traits to make an impact as part of a defensive line rotation, if he can continue developing his handwork and consistency. His ascending skill set should speak to every scheme.\nMalachi Moore\nMoore doesn\u2019t have difference-making size or athletic traits, but he is a tough, instinctive player who can defend the run and play with just enough range in coverage. He projects best as a post or half-field safety in zone, which would allow him to patrol, work top-down and be a solid NFL contributor.\nOronde Gadsden II\nGadsden is an athletic pass catcher with the adjustment skills and catch radius to be a possession target in an NFL offense, although his average frame and marginal ability to sustain blocks create questions about his role. He projects best as an F tight end who can be flexed across the formation and should continue to get better.\nDavid Walker\nWalker isn\u2019t a one-trick pony. He uses his core strength and body quickness to mix up his rush attack, although his lack of length will be tougher to overcome against NFL tackles. His measurements and play style give off Carl Lawson vibes.\nJaylen Reed\nReed has the athletic traits and competitive urgency NFL teams want on their rosters, but he might be stuck as a backup and special-teamer until he cuts down on costly mistakes. He has starting potential in the post if he finds better consistency.\nMitchell Evans\nEvans might not be special in any one area, but he has a well-rounded game with the tools to be a solid secondary option in an NFL passing offense. As long as he stays healthy, he can earn his way onto the field in \u201c12\u201d personnel packages.\nWill Howard\nHoward has a couple plays on each tape that make evaluators question if his decision-making and placement are consistent enough for him to be an NFL starter. But he has the physical requirements, intelligence and mental resiliency to stick as a backup and potential spot-starter.\nOllie Gordon II\nGordon runs with life in his legs that makes him a threat any time he touches the rock, but he must improve his decision-making and physicality as a finisher to be a consistent down-to-down runner. His promise as a blocker and pass catcher will help his chances on an NFL depth chart.\nJaylin Lane\nLane is missing the well-rounded effectiveness that teams want in a starter, but his balance and acceleration \u2014 especially with the ball in his hands \u2014 will give him a chance to impress an NFL coaching staff in camp. His value as a punt returner should boost his chances of securing a roster spot and getting on the field.\nDevin Neal\nNeal isn\u2019t a punishing runner, but he consistently creates yardage with his pacing, wiggle and knack for setting up defenders. The two backs have very different body types, but Neal\u2019s skill set is reminiscent of that of Kyren Williams.\nKyle Kennard\nKennard has work to do developing his counters and becoming more consistent on run downs to reach his NFL potential, but he brings energetic speed off the edge when he can pin his ears back. He projects as a passing-down specialist, and his role can evolve from there.\nTez Johnson\nJohnson needs to improve on the technical side, and his lack of size and strength are limiting factors, but he is a blur when he runs and catches the ball with confident hands. Though he has NFL starting upside, he is more likely to be a role player who can produce on screens, shallows, deep verticals and as a punt returner.\nDrew Kendall\nKendall might not be a mauler, but he works hard to stay attached using his athletic body control and instinctive technique, which help him finish the mission. He offers NFL starting upside in a zone-blocking scheme.\nKobe King\nKing will be targeted by offenses in coverage, but he fills quickly and powerfully at contact with the skill set to be a useful run defender. He projects as a throwback, early-down NFL linebacker with special teams potential.\nJalen Rivers\nRivers is a large-bodied athlete with the long arms, play strength and functional movements to execute his blocking assignment. His overaggressive tendencies lead to balance issues, however, which must be addressed by pro coaching. He has NFL starting potential and fits best at guard.\nBarrett Carter\nCarter plays with the type of pursuit speed that can be weaponized as both a run defender and cover man, although he might be too reactionary and undersized for what some NFL schemes desire. At the very least, he will be lightning on special teams coverages while fighting for footing on the linebacker depth chart.\nKain Medrano\nMedrano must better balance being aggressive and improving his discipline, but his speed and hyper-activity level will serve him well on an NFL field. His experience and traits will earn him an immediate role on special teams.\nDillon Gabriel\nGabriel looks small in the pocket and has some limitations as a downfield thrower, but he is a rhythm passer with the football instincts and mature intangibles to overcome his physical shortcomings. A savvy lefty with a quick release, he has similarities to Tua Tagovailoa \u2014 and has a fighting chance to earn a backup role in the NFL.\nDamien Martinez\nMartinez doesn\u2019t have the burst or wiggle to consistently make defenders miss, but he can power through/over them and prides himself on his finishing ability to churn out positive yards. He can be a \u201cdirty work\u201d runner on an NFL depth chart.\nCameron Williams\nWilliams is incredibly raw, which presents itself in several ways, but the physical traits and power are easy to identify and will have NFL offensive line coaches excited about developing him. As long as his knee is healthy, he has down-the-road starting ability at tackle or guard.\nBilhal Kone\nKone isn\u2019t a polished player just yet, but his collection of athletic traits and overall toughness are worth the mid-round investment. He fits both press and zone schemes with upside as a starter.\nEmery Jones Jr.\nJones is physically talented, with NFL size, strength and functional movements. The undisciplined balance and recovery skills, however, have been his undoing and need to be developed by pro coaching. He can compete for right tackle reps, although a move inside to guard might smooth his path.\nCJ West\nWest doesn\u2019t have the size measurements to fit every scheme, and he needs to continue connecting the dots as a pass rusher, but his natural leverage, play violence and ascending instincts are of NFL quality. Similar in ways to Poona Ford, he has the goods to become a valuable part of a defensive line rotation.\nKeandre Lambert-Smith\nLambert-Smith has the explosive speed to be a big-play threat for a vertical-based offense, although the volatility in his game will pigeonhole him. His lack of special teams experience will need to change for him to secure a roster spot.\nCaleb Rogers\nRogers needs continued technical refinement with his hands and posture, especially inside at guard, but his blend of foot quickness, play strength and competitive toughness create optimism for his pro transition. He projects as a versatile backup with spot-starter potential.\nElijah Roberts\nRoberts is more deliberate than dynamic as an athlete. He accelerates well in short areas, though, and power is the foundation of his game, which shows both as a pass rusher and edge setter. His uniqueness might scare off some teams, but he has the goods to be a rotational edge with upside on the interior.\nLeQuint Allen\nAllen is an upright, determined runner with good short-area quickness, although what separates him is his production on passing downs \u2014 running routes, finishing catches and holding up as a pass blocker. I like his chances of becoming an electric committee back and special-teamer in the NFL.\nCody Simon\nSimon is urgent and decisive downhill with terrific key-and-diagnose skills, but he will need to prove not to be a liability on passing downs to ascend past role-player status. His intangibles will make him a favorite of the NFL coaching staff that drafts him.\nFadil Diggs\nDiggs might not have any exceptional traits that separate him, but he is a well-rounded player with enough athleticism and physicality packed into an NFL frame. He projects as a scheme-versatile NFL backup who can provide a nice changeup off the bench.\nChimere Dike\nDike has somewhat of a confused identity as a receiver. He is more than just a field-stretcher, but he also must develop better nuance in his routes and at the catch point to become more reliable as a separator or possession target. There is something here, and his special teams impact (as a returner or gunner) should lengthen the leash as NFL coaching attempts to maximize his talent.\nBrashard Smith\nSmith needs to continue developing his run discipline and tempo, but he runs hard and explosively with terrific control for abrupt cuts. Given his versatility as a runner and receiver, he has the upside of a dynamic role player who can be flexed across the offense and affect the defensive game plan.\nCaleb Ransaw\nRansaw doesn\u2019t have the resume of a playmaker, but his natural explosion and tackling skills are qualities NFL teams will put to use on special teams. Ransaw can provide depth in the secondary, too. His inside/outside experience will smooth his NFL transition.\nJJ Pegues\nPegues is a compactly built athlete with the quickness and play strength to give blockers trouble from different alignments, although his ability to access counters and show better resolve will be his key to carving out a permanent defensive role. His versatility on offense should only boost his chances of locking down a roster spot.\nRiley Leonard\nLeonard has an interesting upside because of his athletic passing tools and elite makeup, but it will take time for him to develop NFL-caliber field vision and pocket rhythm. He projects as a backup in a scheme that leverages his mobility.\nJackson Slater\nSlater needs to shore up his technique to better match up with NFL talent, but his movement ability, core strength and active eyes form a solid foundation for the next level. He projects as a guard/center NFL backup with a chance to be more in the right situation.\nRylie Mills\nMills is an energetic player with quickness, play strength and a feel for getting off blocks, which makes him a fit for an even (three-technique, B-gap rusher) or odd front (head-up, two-gapping end). His late-season knee injury will affect his draft projection, but his talent belongs in an NFL defensive line rotation.\nTai Felton\nFelton has the explosive speed to be a weapon in the quick game and downfield, which gives him NFL starting potential as a Z receiver. His special teams experience will only boost his chances of cementing a spot on an NFL depth chart.\nWoody Marks\nMarks has only average explosiveness and speed, but his low-to-the-ground run style and sharp run angles make him tough to get on the ground. His pass-catching skills and impact on third downs will ensure him a role in an NFL backfield.\nMaxen Hook\nHook is a hard-nosed competitor with the pursuit skills and athletic talent (burst, speed, change of direction) to compete for a box or two-high role in a variety of schemes. His special teams impact should keep him on a roster long-term, as long as he stays healthy.\nLogan Brown\nBrown\u2019s untidy technique and lack of experience lead to balance issues, but he has an interesting combination of size, quickness and natural power that can be developed by NFL coaching. He projects as a reserve swing tackle with a path to becoming a starter at some point on his rookie deal.\nDenzel Burke\nBurke is missing a true distinguishing trait at a position that\u2019s heavily scouted based on the stopwatch and measuring tape, but he plays alert, physical and determined. He has a chance to earn a backup role in the NFL while fighting for starting reps.\nJack Kiser\nKiser is able to key run/pass quickly to consistently be around the ball, and he has the competitive skill set to be a solid backup and special-teamer at the next level. Considering his character and tools, he will make it difficult for NFL coaches to cut him.\nKyle Monangai\nMonangai lacks breakaway speed, but he can pick, slide and weave through the defense with shifty quickness and run toughness. His competitive profile and promising reps on passing downs should make him an effective utility back in the NFL.\nDante Trader Jr.\nTrader falls short of what teams desire size-wise at safety, but he is a tough, instinctive defender at his best driving downhill, although he also can patrol the deep half and match up man-to-man against tight ends. His aggressive play style will help him earn a backup role with the potential to eventually become a starter.\nJared Ivey\nIvey has the length and versatile skill set NFL teams want in their defensive line rooms, although he needs to play with more consistent violence and rush efficiency to stand out when working alongside proven NFL vets. He can contribute on sub-package downs as a rookie and push for a more meaningful role with added consistency.\nCam Horsley\nHorsley plays with the size and power to reset the line of scrimmage when he stays leveraged, making it difficult for run blockers to do their job. He has the talent to be a rotational nose for a long time in the NFL.\nArian Smith\nSmith is a vertical target who lacks polish and catch-point consistency, but he has the type of speed to pop a big play or two each game. His potential role as a gunner and decoy will boost his chances of sticking on the back end of an NFL roster.\nCraig Woodson\nWoodson doesn\u2019t have dominant size or traits that make him jump off the film, but he is good enough in most critical categories NFL teams want at the safety position. He will be ready from day one to compete for a depth role.\nJoshua Gray\nGray is a fluid big man with the mobility that can be weaponized in a zone-blocking scheme, although the lingering concern is whether or not he will be able to anchor at shallow depth and hold up against NFL power. He should provide depth at both center and guard.\nBryce Cabeldue\nCabeldue is a college tackle who projects best inside at guard, where his competitive edge, foot quickness and hand strength should translate well. He didn\u2019t have any guard reps in college, but he looked comfortable there during East-West Shrine Bowl practices.\nPat Bryant\nBryant isn\u2019t super dynamic, which will be tougher to mask against NFL competition, but his body coordination and ascending technique match well with his natural tracking skills. He projects as a backup possession target who can fight for a WR2 or WR3 role in the right situation.\nJonah Monheim\nMonheim has outstanding makeup and foot quickness, with experience across the offensive line, but his lack of length alone will eliminate him from consideration for several NFL teams. He projects as a depth piece who can earn a roster spot as a backup center.\nJaydon Blue\nBlue is a threat to make a house call at any point, especially as a receiving weapon out of the backfield, but NFL scouts say he may need time to learn what it takes to be a professional. His dynamic talent can upgrade a backfield.\nRobert Longerbeam\nLongerbeam is lean and underpowered, which won\u2019t be easy to mask against NFL size. His speed and athletic instincts are NFL-level quality, however, giving him a chance to earn a long-term role. He projects as a rookie backup with upside to be more.\nTeddye Buchanan\nBuchanan\u2019s physical traits are more good than great, but he is scrappy and football smart with strong tackling skills and competitive makeup. He projects as a Mike linebacker who can play on special teams until his opportunity comes.\nCarson Vinson\nVinson has some habits that must be fine-tuned before he is ready for NFL competition, but he has intriguing physical traits with the energy and desire to get the most out of his ability. There shouldn\u2019t be an expectation of an immediate return on investment, but he is a worthy draft-and-develop lineman.\nYahya Black\nBlack looks every bit the part of a \u201cdo your job\u201d defender who clogs run lanes and does the dirty work, although he will need to improve his disruptive skills to be a three-down player. He offers the scheme versatility to become a role player in any system.\nTahj Brooks\nBrooks won\u2019t be a fit for a team searching for a speed back, but his agility, contact balance and feel as a runner directly leads to rushing production. Even with worn treads, the dependability factor plays to his favor, because of his durability and reliability on third downs.\nJake Briningstool\nBriningstool is a tall, lean athlete who understands how to maximize his catch radius and offers enough competitiveness as a blocker to fight for playing time once on an NFL roster. He projects as an \u201cF\u201d tight end, similar to Josh Whyle.\nJah Joyner\nJoyner has impressive physical attributes with the toolbox that NFL coaches want to work with, but he is still learning the finer points of the pass rush and his impact doesn\u2019t currently reflect his traits. He has the upside of an NFL starter, but his tape shows a rotational player \u2014 until he proves otherwise.\nKorie Black\nBlack needs to improve his eye discipline to better stay in phase, but NFL teams will like his physical attitude and length to match up in coverage or as a tackler.\nQue Robinson\nRobinson is a traits-based, tweener prospect with potential as an edge setter, although his lack of development is going to stick out like a sore thumb next to NFL players in training camp. His saving grace is his coverage talent on special teams, which might keep him on a roster as he grows as a defender.\nMarques Sigle\nSigle\u2019s missteps can be costly, but he feels route development around him and has above-average speed to be a factor in the play. He is scheme versatile with the athleticism to fit different coverages.\nMoliki Matavao\nMatavao won\u2019t wow with long speed, but he offers more as a pass catcher than his college stat line suggests and shows promise as a blocker. He can secure an NFL roster spot as a backup and work his way up from there.\nZy Alexander\nAlexander won\u2019t be an ideal fit for every scheme, but he has the athleticism, body length and ball skills to compete for a starting role in Cover 3. Because of his run-support skills, several NFL teams view him as a better fit at safety.\nShemar James\nJames needs to mature his play recognition to cut down on the missteps, but the athletic tools are there for him to become a rangy run-and-hit defender. Carving out a special teams role early in his career will be critical as he develops.\nMac McWilliams\nMcWilliams lacks ideal length to match up with size on the outside, but he fits well in the slot with his stop-start quickness to stay attached and play through the hands of targets. He is ready to compete for an immediate role as an NFL rookie.\nNick Nash\nNash doesn\u2019t have the explosive speed to be a high-end separator, but he plays well to his strengths and has the ball skills and physicality that will translate. He projects best as a \u201cbig\u201d slot and possession target.\nMyles Hinton\nHinton leaves you wanting more on his tape, but his traits are appealing \u2014 he has the length, feet and core strength to stabilize his blocks. He projects as a depth piece for an NFL offensive line, with swing-tackle potential.\nHunter Wohler\nWohler is a one-speed athlete and will be limited as a true coverage player at the next level, but his read-react ability and competitive edge versus the run should give him NFL value. He might not be an ideal starter, but he has the tools to hang around as a quality depth piece and special-teamer.\nNick Martin\nMartin doesn\u2019t have the size that most teams desire at the position, but his urgent athleticism will give him a chance to earn a role as a Will linebacker. He should find regular work as a core special-teamer and be the first man off the bench on defense.\nHollin Pierce\nPierce is a towering offensive tackle with rare length to steer and swallow up defenders, although there are drawbacks to his frame that leave him off balance. He projects as a swing backup in the NFL, with a chance to be more.\nIsaiah Bond\nBond has unquestioned athletic talent and upside, but he will need to prove to be more reliable within the structure of an offense for an NFL coaching staff to trust him. There is a boom-or-bust element to his projection, but the \u201cboom\u201d will be pretty appealing on Day 2.\nJalen Travis\nTravis\u2019 balance and anchor issues will be catnip for savvy NFL defenders, but he is relatively athletic for a body that size and strong as hell to secure blocks once in position. He has developmental potential as an NFL swing tackle.\nAntwaun Powell-Ryland\nPowell-Ryland posted eye-popping pass-rush production with active hands to slip blocks, but he doesn\u2019t offer ideal traits by NFL standards and inconsistent run-game reps leave his NFL role in question. He projects as a potential nickel rusher.\nUpton Stout\nStout\u2019s lack of inches shows versus size in coverage, but so does his competitive urgency and controlled movements in all areas of the position. He projects as a slot cornerback who can be a role player similar to Avonte Maddox.\nTommi Hill\nHill is a good-sized man corner with the competitiveness and athleticism to push for early playing time in the NFL. Drafting him will require a leap of faith that he\u2019ll return to his 2023 form, but it won\u2019t be surprising if he outplays his draft spot.\nDont'e Thornton Jr.\nThornton lacks versatility, but his gliding speed and ability to find another gear downfield could make him a big-play threat in a specified vertical role. His value as a prospect will vary from team to team.\nZah Frazier\nFrazier is a long, lean bump-and-run corner with the speed and coordination to cling to receivers and find the football, when his technique stays consistent. There isn\u2019t much mystery why a team might feel he is worth the gamble on Day 3 of the draft.\nMarcus Harris\nHarris needs to improve some of his spacing issues in coverage, but he has legit speed and ball skills that will serve him well in the NFL. He falls in the \u201cthere is something promising here\u201d category of prospects.\nCJ Dippre\nDippre doesn\u2019t have a true distinguishing trait as a blocker or receiver, but he is good enough in both areas to have a fighting chance at a roster spot. His special teams experience will be an asset in camp.\nIsaac TeSlaa\nTeSlaa is still very much a work in progress with his route running and ability to create space, but the athletic tools and ball skills are exceptional and the football character and toughness will help sway doubters. He projects as a depth receiver with upside on offense and special teams.\nNazir Stackhouse\nStackhouse is a naturally powerful human who can two-gap, eat up double teams and make run stops at the line. He will add early-down nose tackle depth to an NFL defense.\nXavier Restrepo\nIt can be easy to get caught up in Restrepo\u2019s lack of top-tier size/speed traits, but his toughness and dependability securing grabs will give him a chance to carve out a productive slot role in the NFL. His competitive nature and football instincts are similar stylistically to the traits of Julian Edelman.\nKalel Mullings\nMullings doesn\u2019t offer any difference-making qualities, but he follows his blocks and grinds yards. His experience on special teams will help separate him on an NFL depth chart. How quickly he gains the trust of his NFL coaches as a blocker and pass catcher will determine his early playing time.\nJared Harrison-Hunte\nHarrison-Hunte might not be an ideal body/style fit for every defense, but he is explosive, active and promising in enough areas on the field to earn a rotational role in an attacking, one-gapping scheme.\nCody Lindenberg\nLindenberg has throwback size and rallies well to the football, but he doesn\u2019t consistently stay ahead of plays and ends up stuck \u2014 an issue that will lead to less production in the NFL than it did in college. He projects as a backup Will with special teams tools.\nJacory Croskey-Merritt\nThere is an unpredictability to his run style that keeps both defenders and his own coaches on the edge of their seat, but you\u2019ll live with the volatility because of his electric plant and burst to naturally string moves together and create chunk plays. He projects as an offense\u2019s change-of-pace weapon.\nRicky White III\nWhite is a bursty receiving option who can earn meaningful NFL snaps on offense with continued technical fine-tuning of his routes and catch-point consistency. His special teams impact should help separate him on draft boards \u2014 and on an NFL depth chart.\nSebastian Castro\nCastro is an instinctive zone defender with trustworthy football character, but his ordinary speed and explosiveness limit his upside in most schemes. He best fits as a big nickel safety, likely as a backup.\nJoe Huber\nHuber might not have a true distinguishing trait, but he also doesn\u2019t have any glaring weaknesses that would keep him from becoming a depth piece on an NFL roster. He is best suited for a power-based scheme and offers proven versatility on the interior.\nThomas Fidone II\nFidone is a plucky athlete with appealing length and speed, but he hasn\u2019t yet played his best football and will need to develop quickly once in an NFL camp to earn a role. He didn\u2019t play much special teams in college, which will need to change at the next level.\nJordan Hancock\nHancock is a quick and physical defender with versatile experience, although his average speed and below-average balance when turning and phasing routes will be an issue against NFL slots. His best pro position might be as a safety who can provide depth at different spots in the secondary.\nEugene Asante\nAsante needs to play with better restraint to avoid mistakes, but he sets the tempo with overflowing adrenaline. Players with his combination of speed, energy and competitive toughness usually find ways onto NFL rosters. His special teams impact will stand out immediately.\nJack Nelson\nNelson is an instinctive, skilled blocker with the baseline traits for the next level, although he might be a \u201cmaster of none\u201d type of blocker, which could relegate him to backup status.\nDan Jackson\nJackson doesn\u2019t have the high-end coverage skills desired at the position, but he is instinctive, tough and determined, and his stopwatch speed shows when working downhill. At the very least, his special teams impact will make it tough for an NFL coaching staff to cut him.\nCollin Oliver\nOliver is an explosive, leverage-based rusher, but he lacks the measurables for full-time edge work and is unproven dropping or playing from depth. He projects best as a nickel rusher with long-term potential as a developmental off-ball linebacker.\nJackson Hawes\nHawes is a one-speed athlete and has a low ceiling as a passing target, but his functional athleticism, technical approach and competitive attitude should be enough to keep him on an NFL roster. He is a classic Y tight end prospect.\nWarren Brinson\nBrinson flashes NFL-level play with his ability to get off blocks and force his way through gaps, but excitement over his talent needs to be tempered by his sporadic impact. He offers intriguing tools in an NFL-ready body.\nKurtis Rourke\nRourke is a good-sized pocket passer who will push the ball downfield when everything stays on schedule, but his average mobility will be tough to mask against NFL defenses. He is a potential Aidan O\u2019Connell-level backup, if he stays healthy.\nBru McCoy\nMcCoy doesn\u2019t consistently live up to the promise of his tools on tape, but he is a big, physical possession target, and his size/speed/strength talent is worth the gamble as a team\u2019s potential WR4/5.\nCobee Bryant\nSome NFL teams won\u2019t be able to reconcile the slight frame and average speed, but Bryant\u2019s decisive reactor, ball skills and dog mentality are promising ingredients at the position. He can press, although he is at his best in zone and off coverage.\nIsaiah Neyor\nNeyor is arguably the most physically gifted athlete in the 2025 NFL Draft class, but aggressive defenders can negate his physical advantages and the inconsistencies in his game make him a better talent than a football player. He has upside as a receiver and will help his chances if he can prove himself as a gunner on special teams.\nBranson Taylor\nTaylor has workable tools but needs to iron out the inefficiencies in his game, which would allow him to play with more focus as a finisher. Several teams believe his best pro position will be inside at guard.\nJordan Watkins\nWatkins doesn\u2019t always play up to his timed speed, but he is athletic and smooth catching on the move and can be as good as his target volume. He projects best in the slot, where he can use the entire field.\nJustin Walley\nWalley doesn\u2019t stand out with top-tier size or special traits, but he is competitive with a natural feel for coverage that coaches will want on their teams. He can hold up on the outside, although proving himself in the slot would boost his chances of carving out a long-term NFL role.\nRayuan Lane III\nLane needs to improve his reliability finishing tackles, but his fluid athleticism and football IQ are NFL-quality traits. His special teams impact as a gunner can really separate him on draft boards and in training camp.\nTim Smith\nSmith\u2019s stat production doesn\u2019t indicate an impactful player, but he consistently flashes on tape with the traits and assignment-sound mentality that suggest he can be a role player in the NFL.\nKaimon Rucker\nRucker doesn\u2019t have the high-level rush tools to make teams easily overlook his size deficiencies, but he plays with a violent energy that gives him a chance to carve out a role. His game resembles that of Ogbo Okoronkwo, who has been a productive NFL pass rusher.\nEli Cox\nCox doesn\u2019t have ideal power, which will be noticeable if he\u2019s tasked with facing long-armed NFL defenders, but he moves well and could provide depth in the right situation. He projects best in a zone-based system.\nJalin Conyers\nConyers has NFL athleticism and talent. Whether or not he can fine-tune the details will determine his chance of carving out a long-term role as a No. 2 TE option. He has the versatility to be flexed around the field as a steady blocker and target.\nHayden Conner\nConner isn\u2019t a slug, but his athletic profile won\u2019t be a fit for every scheme. Nonetheless, he is durable, strong and technically steady. He can provide depth on the interior of an NFL offensive line.\nJason Marshall Jr.\nMarshall has the size and athletic ability to tighten throwing windows in man coverage, but inconsistent reads and reactions are too common on his tape. If NFL teams are convinced he is coachable, he is a worthy draft-and-develop candidate.\nPhil Mafah\nMafah is a big, strong downhill runner who lacks explosiveness to be a consistent perimeter runner but has the footwork and power to work between the tackles. He has the necessary skills to hold up his end of the bargain in a two-headed NFL backfield committee.\nClay Webb\nWebb has the feel and core strength to execute different run-blocking schemes, although answering the length and power of NFL defensive linemen will be a major jump. Convincing an NFL coaching staff that he can provide depth at both guard and center will be critical for his chances of making a roster.\nTyler Baron\nBaron has some pass-rush skill, but he\u2019s an uneven run performer and there isn\u2019t much that distinguishes him by NFL standards, beyond being a potential rotational piece. If he brings his fastball, he is a potential sub-package rusher for an NFL defense.\nGavin Bartholomew\nBartholomew needs to continue getting stronger and sharpening his routes to find a permanent home in the NFL, but he has better pass-catching traits than his stat line would suggest. His intangibles will make it tough for a coaching staff to cut him.\nJalen McLeod\nMcLeod is the type of prospect that grows on you, because of the different ways he can align and make an impact. It will be critical for him to find the right role, though. He projects best as a hybrid outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme.\nAhmed Hassanein\nHassanein is a try-hard edge rusher with plenty of redeeming qualities that will endear him to coaches. He lacks high-level athletic traits, though, and will be low on an NFL depth chart until he improves his predictability as a pass rusher. Given his meager football experience, NFL teams are intrigued by his untapped upside.\nFrancisco Mauigoa\nMauigoa needs to clean up his missed tackles and coverage missteps to earn defensive snaps, but his instincts, chase speed and mentality are draftable traits that will endear him to NFL coaching. Special teams will help him make a roster.\nJoshua Simon\nSimon has explosive elements to his profile, along with the ball skills and toughness that will serve him well in an NFL tight end room. He projects as a reserve F tight end.\nAlijah Huzzie\nHuzzie is more quick than explosive and will have some tough moments against NFL size, but his coordinated athleticism and compete skills help keep him connected in coverage. His tape reminds me of Kindle Vildor when he was coming out of Georgia Southern in the 2020 draft class. His recent ACL injury will affect his projection.\nCam Miller\nMiller won\u2019t wow you right away because the physical traits are average. The more you watch, though, the more you come to appreciate his decision-making and feel for the position. He can be an asset in an NFL quarterback room as a reserve.\nLuke Kandra\nKandra is mechanical and upright in his movements, so it doesn\u2019t always look pretty, but he finds a way, rarely allowing his quarterback to be pressured and routinely executing his assignments in the run game. If he lands in the right spot, he could stick on an NFL roster.\nMalik Verdon\nVerdon is a tall, long athlete with a unique skill set as a low-hole defender, but his anticipation and finishing skills must improve before he is ready for full-time snaps in the NFL. Learning to make an impact on special teams will be important for him.\nMax Brosmer\nBrosmer is inconsistent when asked to play outside of structure, but he has several redeeming qualities, most notably his intelligence and drive, the chief reasons he can carve out a backup role in the NFL.\nGarrett Dellinger\nDellinger isn\u2019t a top-tier athlete and needs to address some bad habits, but his play strength and smarts can be assets in an NFL offensive line room. He projects as a backup guard, ideally suited for a power scheme.\nRaheim Sanders\nSanders doesn\u2019t consistently run as powerfully as his size might suggest, but he shows vision at the line of scrimmage to press, cut and stay on his feet through contact. His receiving skills will expand his usefulness for an NFL offense.\nJaylin Smith\nSmith\u2019s lack of size will show in several ways against NFL competition, but he is an agile-footed, speedy corner with the compete skills to fight for an inside nickel role. He will need to prove he can stay healthy to stick on a roster.\nKitan Crawford\nCrawford has NFL-level speed and athleticism, but his inconsistent reads reflect his meager starting experience in the secondary. His special teams background and testing numbers will make him an appealing prospect in the later rounds.\nEric Gregory\nGregory is an athletic-looking 320-pounder who has enough power to control the block in front of him, but he is more likely to be on the clean-up crew (rather than the defender creating disruption). He has the foundation of an early-down backup in the NFL.\nElijah Ponder\nPonder doesn\u2019t always play up to his testing numbers, but he rushes with an initial and late burst to affect the quarterback. He projects as a sub-package rusher.\nKonata Mumpfield\nMumpfield doesn\u2019t wow with size or vertical speed, but he is a route-running craftsman and finds open windows for his quarterback. His toughness and attention to detail should help separate him in training camp.\nCorey Kiner\nKiner is a compactly built tackle breaker. He won\u2019t impress with speed or burst, but his balance through contact will be his NFL ticket. Proving himself on passing downs will help his chances of making a roster.\nLuke Lachey\nLachey doesn\u2019t have any dynamic elements in his game, but he catches the ball cleanly and is willing to do the dirty work in the run game. His competitive wiring will help him compete for a backup role in the NFL.\nEsa Pole\nPole is still very much a work in progress and needs to bank valuable experience. At the end of the day, though, nimble athletes with his size and strength are tough to find. He is worth a draft pick as a developmental option and practice squad candidate.\nDominic Lovett\nLovett presents a small-throwing target and likely will be limited to the slot, but he has a fluid stride with solid ball skills to make plays \u2014 if given the chance. His speed can be used on special teams, as well.\nJackson Woodard\nIt will be tough for Woodard to be as dynamic in the NFL as he was in college, but his play recognition, toughness and intangibles are traits that keep players on NFL rosters. He can become a team\u2019s fourth linebacker and a special-teamer, with a chance to rise from there.\nBJ Adams\nAdams is long-limbed with enough athleticism to match routes from press, but he plays wild and upright in his movements, and his freelancing technique leads to spacing issues that NFL receivers will exploit. He is a developmental option for man-heavy teams.\nJay Higgins\nHiggins\u2019 lack of ideal speed and length will be more glaring in the NFL, but he consistently punches above his weight class. His instincts and toughness will help disguise concerns about his game, too. His game is reminiscent of Anthony Walker, who has been a productive pro when healthy.\nAjani Cornelius\nIt doesn\u2019t always look pretty with Cornelius, especially when stressed to protect the edge, but he often gets the job done when he weaponizes his hands to keep defenders occupied. He projects as an NFL backup and will prolong his career if he can provide depth inside as guard as well.\nJimmy Horn Jr.\nHorn has size and strength limitations and needs to show better consistency at the next level, but he can be dynamic catching in stride and creating with the ball in his hands. He will need to prove himself as more than just a gadget player, and a return role on special teams will help his chances.\nElijah Simmons\nSimmons has the natural body girth to grow roots and play stout against down blocks and double teams, but he will need to prove to NFL coaching that he can handle more of a workload to lock down a roster spot. He projects as an early-down nose.\nEthan Downs\nDowns has some tweener traits and will be caught in between positions for several schemes, but he is a high-motor, blue-collar base end, and coaches will appreciate that they\u2019ll know exactly what they are getting every down. His experience on special teams (382 snaps in college) can help him earn a backup role.\nCarson Bruener\nBruener will be limited by middling agility and play violence, but his production represents an ability to always be around the football. He projects as an NFL backup with the speed and mentality of a core special-teamer.\nTonka Hemingway\nHemingway probably isn\u2019t going to have a ton of success as a pure take-on player in the NFL, but he moves well for his size and has a feel for keeping himself freed up to chase the football. His best fit will be in a scheme that helps keep him clean, potentially outside on the edge.\nDonovan Edwards\nEdwards\u2019 inconsistent vision and contact balance as an inside runner will limit his role in the NFL, but his pass-catching skills could be his saving grace toward earning a roster spot. He projects as a change-of-pace runner with receiving versatility.\nXavier Truss\nTruss needs to develop better consistency to stick at the next level, but he is large, competitive and experienced at multiple positions, which likely will get him drafted late. He can fight for a swing backup role, likely at guard.\nJake Majors\nMajors (who is a left-handed snapper) is a center-only prospect with a relatively low pro ceiling, but there is a consistency to his game that is easy to appreciate, because of his football-playing instincts and competitiveness. He projects as an NFL backup, although his lack of position flexibility will work against him.\nMontrell Johnson Jr.\nJohnson is at his best when he trusts his tempo to play off blocks with contact balance and physicality, searching for a lane to unleash his speed. He hasn\u2019t proven himself enough on passing downs, but he reminds me of an off-brand Chuba Hubbard-style runner.\nZeek Biggers\nBiggers is appropriately named \u2014 his size and ability look good on paper. The traits, however, need to translate better on the field for him to consistently impact the game. He has the tools to fit in even or odd fronts.\nJailin Walker\nWalker is shot out of a cannon when he trusts his vision, and his 2024 jump in production against better competition is encouraging. As confirmed by his testing numbers, he has the speed and wiring to shine on special teams while adding depth on defense.\nElijhah Badger\nBadger needs to improve his route awareness for NFL quarterbacks and coaches to trust him, but the athleticism and catch-point talent are there for him to find a role.\nR.J. Mickens\nMickens doesn\u2019t consistently play up to his testing numbers, but he has a keen sense of football geometry and takes precise, physical angles to the football. He projects as a potential backup and special-teamer in the NFL.\nTyler Batty\nBatty might not bring the impact consistency NFL teams want in a starter or high-end backup, but he wins in different ways \u2014 defensive coordinators who place premiums on size and motor will welcome him with open arms. He can be a day one depth player.\nMello Dotson\nDotson lacks elite foot agility and long speed for man coverage, but he shows a good feel for what the offense is trying to do and reacts accordingly. He will be a potential target late in the draft for a zone-heavy team.\nSeth Henigan\nHenigan will have a chance at a pro career because he can play on time and deliver with touch, but his movements and arm power won\u2019t stand out. He can be an NFL backup in the right situation.\nBrandon Crenshaw-Dickson\nCrenshaw-Dickson is an active blocker who should be able to weaponize his length with further coaching, although the rough patches in his game will require extra patience. He is a developmental option.\nMarcus Yarns\nYarns is undersized, which will limit his role in the NFL, but his open-field speed and versatility as a pass catcher can be weaponized by the right team. He projects as a complementary option with special teams upside.\nHoward Cross III\nCross has the initial quickness, lateral agility and handwork to play in gaps, although he tends to be reliant on his first step and has too much volatility on his run-defending snaps. He competes his butt off and has upside as a sub-package gap shooter.\nMarcus Tate\nTate has an NFL frame with functional mobility and technique but must show he can overcome his questionable balance and body control in the run game. He will boost his chances if he can prove to coaches that he has versatility across the interior. He is expected to be full-go by training camp after January knee surgery.\nSean Martin\nMartin is a durable player (played every game the past four seasons), with above-average length and body twitch. It won\u2019t be a surprise if he becomes a better pro than college player, likely in a 4i-/five-technique role.\nKobe Hudson\nHudson will face even tighter separation windows against NFL defenders and must improve his catch-point focus, but his toughness and traits suggest he could be productive in a complementary role (similar to K.J. Osborn).\nJabbar Muhammad\nMuhammad has arguably the most impressive blend of fluidity and ball-hawking instincts in this draft class, but masking his size, speed and strength limitations will be a tough task against NFL-caliber athletes. His NFL-ready skill set will give him a chance to stand out in camp.\nWillie Lampkin\nLampkin is an extreme size outlier, which will be a non-starter with most NFL teams, but the tape says he can get the job done with his natural leverage and stubborn hands. There isn\u2019t much of a size comparison for him currently in the NFL, but he is accustomed to overcoming the odds.\nCaleb Etienne\nEtienne doesn\u2019t play with the reaction quickness to answer NFL talent, but he is a mountain of a human with intriguing tools that can be cultivated.\nFentrell Cypress II\nCypress hasn\u2019t put consistency on tape, but when you grade to the flashes and trust his testing numbers, you can understand why a team could think there might be something there.\nChaz Chambliss\nChambliss is a sawed-off edge defender who can provide depth as an outside linebacker in a 3-4, but his ticket to an NFL roster spot will be as a special teams ace.\nIsas Waxter II\nWaxter needs to polish his footwork and technique, but he passes the eye test, runs well enough and battles on every snap. Some NFL teams have him tagged as a future safety.\nJamon Dumas-Johnson\nDumas-Johnson is sound in his run fits and competes with a confident, physical edge, but he will need to prove he won\u2019t be a liability in coverage to see significant defensive snaps. He has the skill set of a potential role player and special-teamer.\nKyonte Hamilton\nHamilton is strong, explosive and durable. He\u2019s viewed as an ascending prospect by NFL teams.\nMelvin Smith Jr.\nSmith had the pre-draft process he needed to earn a shot \u2014 he didn\u2019t appear out of his element against better competition at the Senior Bowl, and his testing verified that he has NFL-level athleticism.\n(Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; Top photos: Andy Lyons, John E.
