  "description": "The long-awaited Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally on the horizon, and fans are gearing up for launch day.

  "content": "The long-awaited Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally on the horizon, and fans are gearing up for launch day. While the game promises endless ways to build your coffers on-screen, you can start stacking savings in real life, too. The right credit card can help you cut costs on the game, upgrades and even the console you\u2019ll play it on.\n\nGTA 6 is slated for release on May 26, 2026, after Rockstar Games pushed back the initial release date. The delay, however, means that gamers will have plenty of time to prepare a game plan.\n\nRockstar Games offers GTA+, a paid subscription that offers gamers resources and in-game currency. Currently, GTA+ costs $7.99 per month, but gives users an instant leg up in the game, with a revenue stream of GTA$500,000 deposited monthly to your Maze Bank account, member-only Shark cards with a 15% GTA$ bonus, as well as vanity perks, such as access to:\n\nWhile the game is not play to win, these resources will set you ahead of the curve, without having to spend hours grinding to earn in-game currency for cars and clothes. Time, after all, is a resource that money can\u2019t buy. The best credit cards for gamers can help you get to the top with less effort while earning rewards along the way.\n\nThe Prime Visa offers a $150 Amazon gift card upon approval with an eligible Prime membership, which you can use to pay off a year and a half\u2019s worth of GTA+. What\u2019s more, users earn 5% back on purchases at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market and on Chase Travel purchases with an eligible Prime membership, unlimited 2% back at gas stations, restaurants and on local transit and commuting (including rideshare), and unlimited 1% back on other purchases.\n\nKeep in mind, you need to have an Amazon Prime membership to qualify, but the card has no annual fee.\n\nFor a $0 annual fee, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card (rates & fees) offers a flat and uncapped 2% cash rewards on purchases.\n\nCardholders can earn $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months. You can use that offer toward 25 months\u2019 worth of GTA+, while the flat rate earning potential applies across the board for things like consoles and digital purchases.\n\nIf you\u2019re a hardcore PlayStation gamer, the PlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card* might make sense for you, especially as cardholders earn 5 points per dollar spent on qualifying PlayStation and Sony products when you shop directly, in store or at authorized retailers. Earn 3 points for every dollar spent on cable, internet and streaming subscriptions, 2 points on dining and restaurants and 1 point for every $1 spent on all other eligible purchases.\n\nPoints earned with purchases on the PlayStation card can be redeemed for digital gift cards and PlayStation store cards.",

      "text": "Our Verdict\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card (rates & fees) falls into the 2% cash-back category with its 2% cash rewards on purchases. Plus, it offers a handful of practical extras, including a welcome offer, an intro APR and cellphone insurance. With several 2% cash-back credit cards available today, it\u2019s essential to dig through the details to find the best one for you. How does the Active Cash stack up and is it worth considering?

Cardholders earn an unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases. Rewards do not expire as long as the account is open.\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash also comes with a first-year welcome offer: Earn a $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months.\nYou can redeem your Wells Fargo Rewards for:\n- Cash\n- Offsetting purchases\n- Gift cards\n- Charitable donations\nRewards may also be pooled with eligible Wells Fargo points-earnings cards, which include the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card (rates & fees) and the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey\u2120 Card (rates & fees). When you combine your earnings, you can optionally take advantage of Wells Fargo\u2019s travel transfer partners to look for ways to increase the value of your points.\nYou Appreciate the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u2019s Extra Benefits\nNo annual fee can sometimes be synonymous with no extra benefits, but the Active Cash is an outlier. It comes with the following protections and perks:\n- Cellphone protection. Get up to $600 of cellphone protection against damage or theft. Subject to a $25 deductible.\n- Auto rental collision damage waiver. Get secondary insurance coverage up to $50,000 to protect against damage or theft to your rental car.\n- Visa Signature Concierge. Get 24/7, 365-day phone support for travel and entertainment needs.\n- Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection. Get extra perks and benefits at a worldwide collection of properties.\n- Zero liability protection. Cardholders are protected against unauthorized charges if they\u2019re reported promptly.\nWhen You Shouldn\u2019t Consider the Active Cash Card\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all credit card, and what works for one person may not make sense for another. Some reasons you may want to pass on the Wells Fargo Active Cash include:\nYou Need a Lengthier Intro APR Offer\nA card that earns rewards, has no annual fee and offers an introductory APR on purchases is quite the trifecta. However, the Active Cash falls short regarding its introductory APR period length compared to other cards on the market. You\u2019ll get a 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers, then a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR applies. Balance transfers made within 120 days qualify for the intro rate and fee of 3% (min. $5) then a fee of up to 5% (min. $5) applies. If you need a longer intro APR period, the Active Cash may not be right for you.\nYou Want To Maximize Specific Spending Categories\nThe flat-rate cash rewards structure of the Active Cash Card is uncomplicated, but it doesn\u2019t offer the opportunity to earn more in specific spending categories. If a significant portion of your budget goes toward groceries, dining or travel, you could benefit more from a card offering bonus rewards in those areas. Some cards offer 5% or more cash back for everyday categories like gas or groceries.\nYou\u2019re Looking for Travel Benefits or Premium Perks\nThe Active Cash Card is designed for straightforward cash rewards but doesn\u2019t cater to frequent travelers or those seeking premium features. Unlike travel-focused cards, it lacks benefits such as trip cancellation or interruption insurance and charges foreign transaction fees.\nThese perks can significantly enhance your travel experience and save you money abroad. For globetrotters or those who want luxury perks, the Active Cash may feel underwhelming compared to travel cards that prioritize these advantages.\nAre You Eligible for the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card?\nWells Fargo doesn\u2019t specify a credit score required for approval, but some basic criteria can help determine your eligibility for the Active Cash card.\n- Credit score. In general, rewards cards require good credit (FICO Score of 670 or higher), though a score alone will not guarantee approval for any card, including the Wells Fargo Active Cash.\n- Account history. Wells Fargo may limit your ability to be approved for a credit card if you opened another Wells Fargo card within the last six months.\n- Prior card membership. If you\u2019ve held a Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card within the last 48 months (even if that account is closed and has no balance), Wells Fargo may approve you for a new card but could withhold the welcome bonus or intro APR offer.\nWells Fargo Active Cash Rewards Potential\nWe used data from multiple government agencies to estimate a typical household\u2019s spending. Our research showed that a household earning in the 70th percentile in 2025 brings in $127,200 and charges $40,398 to credit cards. Putting all of this spending on the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card would result in $807.96 cash back annually once redeemed. Substitute your spending amounts to calculate your individual anticipated earnings.\nHow To Maximize Wells Fargo Active Cash\n- Capitalize on the welcome offer. If you have a significant upcoming expense, time it to coincide with the new cardholder welcome offer: $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months.\n- Use the card for recurring monthly expenses. You can take advantage of the card\u2019s unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases when using it for recurring monthly expenses. Just don\u2019t forget to pay off your balance each month to avoid interest charges and ultimately negate your rewards.\n- Pair it with a Wells Fargo travel card. By combining the Active Cash with a Wells Fargo points-based card like the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card or Wells Fargo Autograph Journey\u2120 Card you\u2019ll not only get access to more bonus categories but you\u2019ll gain the ability to transfer your rewards to any of Wells Fargo\u2019s airline or hotel travel partners.\nWells Fargo Active Cash Rates and Fees\nInterest Rates\n- Regular APR: 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR\n- Purchase intro APR: 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening\n- Balance transfer intro APR: 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on qualifying balance transfers\nFees\n- Annual fee: $0\n- Balance transfer fee: up to 5%, min: $5\n- Foreign purchase transaction fee: 3%\nHow the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card Stacks Up\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card vs. Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card\nThe Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card is similar to the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card with no annual fee and earning 2% cash back on all purchases\u20141% when purchases are made and another 1% when they\u2019re paid off, and earn 5% total cash back on hotel, car rentals and attractions booked with Citi Travel.\nThose needing a lengthier intro period for balance transfers should choose the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card as you\u2019ll get a 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months. After that, the standard variable APR will be 18.24% to 28.24%, based on creditworthiness. An intro balance transfer fee of either $5 or 3%, whichever is greater, applies to transfers completed within the first 4 months of account opening. After that, the fee will be 5% of each transfer (minimum $5).\nThe Active Cash is better if you want an intro APR for purchases, though, since the Double Cash doesn\u2019t offer that. The Citi Double Cash also doesn\u2019t include cellphone protection like the Wells Fargo Active Cash. However, you can transfer your points to many of Citi\u2019s travel loyalty partners.\nFor a deeper comparison, look into more details in our showdown of the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card vs. Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card.\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card vs. Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae\nIt might be less complex, but the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card may also be less rewarding than the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae. With the Freedom Unlimited, you can earn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel\u2120, 3% cash back on eligible dining and drugstores and 1.5% on all other purchases. The Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae also offers more perks like purchase protection, extended warranty coverage and travel protections.\nBoth cards have similar welcome bonuses, with the Freedom Unlimited new cardholders earn $200 cash back after spending $500 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.\nOur full comparison of the Chase Freedom Unlimited vs. Wells Fargo Active Cash has deeper insight into which card might be right for you.\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card vs. Discover it\u00ae Cash Back\nThe Discover it\u00ae Cash Back has no annual fee and earns excellent bonus rewards in quarterly rotating categories. More effort is required to track these potential bonus rewards than the Active Cash\u2019s simple 2% rewards, but the extra earnings could be worth it. You\u2019ll earn 5% cash back on everyday purchases at different places each quarter up to a quarterly maximum when activated. Plus, earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. The Discover it\u00ae Cash Back doesn\u2019t offer comparable benefits to the Active Cash, like travel and cellphone protections.\nSince these cards differ in how they earn rewards, consider pairing them together. You can use the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back for spending in the bonus categories until you hit the quarterly cap and use the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card for all other purchases.\nAlternatives to the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card\nIs the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card for You?\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is a well-rounded card thanks to its unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases, intro APR and no annual fee. The Active Cash can also be an excellent complementary card to one that earns elevated rewards for spending in specific categories. This will ensure your minimum earning rate on all purchases is double the base rate of most cards.\nWells Fargo Active Cash Review Methodology\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card was graded according to Forbes Advisor\u2019s rankings methodology for cash-back cards. We consider a variety of criteria when assigning a rating to cash-back cards, including:\n- Estimated annual earnings\n- Annual fees\n- Welcome bonus offers\n- Intro APR offers\n- Regular APR\n- Additional cardholder benefits\nWe give greater weight to the card features we believe cardholders will use most frequently. These factors combine to generate a star rating for each card.\nTo learn more about our rating and review methodology and editorial process, check out our guide on how Forbes Advisor rates credit cards.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat credit score is needed for the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card?\nWells Fargo does not disclose the required credit score for the Active Cash, but generally, applicants will need a good or better credit score of about 670 or above. No credit score guarantees approval.\nHow can I get a Wells Fargo credit card?\nThe easiest way to get a Wells Fargo credit card is to find and submit an application at the issuer\u2019s website.

To calculate your variable APR for each billing period, we use the U.S. Prime Rate and add a margin.\nHow We Determine the U.S. Prime Rate\nEach billing period, we use the U.S. Prime Rate that The Wall Street Journal publishes in its Money Rates section three business days before your billing statement\u2019s closing date. When more than one U.S. Prime Rate exists, we use an average. If the U.S. Prime Rate is not published or available (temporarily or permanently), we use a substitute index that we believe is similar to the U.S. Prime Rate. We do so at our sole discretion. As of 09/04/2025, the U.S. Prime Rate is 7.50%.\nHow We Calculate Your Variable APR\nWe use the following margins:\n- For purchases and balance transfers: We add either 11.74%, 16.74%, or 21.74% to the U.S. Prime Rate. Your creditworthiness determines the percentage we use. The Maximum APR is 29.99%.\n- For cash advances and overdraft protection advances: We add 22.74% to the U.S. Prime Rate. The Maximum APR is 29.99%.\nWe reserve the right to change terms, APRs, and fees at our discretion by following your Agreement and as allowed by applicable law.\nPlease note: You may not qualify for the lowest APR described. We review your credit report, information provided in your application, and other available relevant information to determine your APRs.\nHow do we apply your payments?\nMinimum Payment\nGenerally, we process your minimum payment in the following order:Lower APR balances (such as purchases)\nHigher APR balances (such as cash advances)\nAmounts in Excess of the Minimum Payment\nIf you pay more than your required minimum payment, generally we apply the excess first to the higher APR balances and then to lower ones.\nHow does Overdraft Protection work?\nYou can choose whether to link your Account to your Wells Fargo checking account for Overdraft Protection.

      "text": "Our Verdict\nSure, with the PlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card* you can earn big rewards on PlayStation spending and in other areas, like internet and dining, but you can only use those rewards to buy more PlayStation-related paraphernalia. Gaming is a lifestyle for many, but a better financial move would be to earn cash-back rewards you can redeem toward gaming or other things, like bills, groceries or anything you might spend on away from the screen.\nPros\n- No annual fee\n- High rewards on PlayStation and Sony spending, a category not usually bonused on credit cards\nCons\n- Rewards can only be redeemed for PlayStation or Sony merchandise.\n- Few additional benefits\nCurrent PlayStation Visa Offer\n- Earn a $100 statement credit after spending $500 within 60 days of account opening\n- Earn 5 points per dollar spent on qualifying PlayStation and Sony products when you shop directly, in store or at authorized retailers\n- Earn 3 points for every dollar spent on cable, internet and streaming subscriptions\n- Earn 2 points on dining and restaurants and 1 point for every $1 spent on all other eligible purchases\n- Ability to redeem points for tickets to concerts, sporting events and more\nWhat We Love About the PlayStation Visa\nBig Rewards on PlayStation and the Sony Store\nIt\u2019s rare to find a credit card that earns high rewards specifically on PlayStation spending. The card also offers high rewards on Sony spending. In addition to gaming gear, Sony offers an array of electronics from high-end home theater equipment to noise-canceling headphones.\nAttainable Welcome Bonus\nThe card comes with $100 statement credit after spending $500 within 60 days of account opening. Spend $250 a month in the first two months you own the card, and that bonus is yours.\nOther PlayStation Visa Benefits\n- Visa benefits. You\u2019ll either be approved for a Visa or a Visa Signature version of the card when you apply. Both come with benefits that include zero liability for unauthorized transactions and access to pay-per-use roadside dispatch. Visa Signature cards offer additional perks, including special guest benefits at hotels in the Visa Signature Hotel Collection.\n- PlayStation deals. Cardholders will get access to exclusive deals and experiences for PlayStation games, hardware and services.\nWhat We Don\u2019t Love About the PlayStation Visa Card\nIt\u2019s For a Narrow Band of Users\nYou\u2019d have to be a pretty heavy spender on PlayStation and Sony merch to make owning this card worthwhile. Most people will get more benefits out of a card that rewards them for everyday spending categories like groceries or gas.\nYou Need Good or Better Credit To Qualify\nThe card would have greater appeal if it was accessible to those with fair credit, too. This means college students or those still establishing their credit aren\u2019t likely to be approved for this card. What\u2019s a bit confusing is that the card also has an APR range that tops out surprisingly high: 18.24% - 32.24% variable APR. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone with good credit getting stuck with the higher end of that range, but just know it\u2019s a possibility.\nRewards Have Limited Use\nYou can only redeem your rewards for something from the account center. This includes digital gift cards, PlayStation Store codes and occasionally other items, according to the rewards terms and conditions. A cash-back card is a far more flexible option.\nWho Is the PlayStation Visa Card For?\nIdeal For:\n- Someone who spends a fair amount on PlayStation-related items\n- Those who want to earn rewards to use for PlayStation-related purchases\nNot Ideal For:\n- Those who want to earn high rewards on everyday purchases like groceries and gas\n- Anyone who wants the ability to redeem rewards outside the PlayStation ecosystem\nPlayStation Visa Card Rewards\nEarning Rewards\nThe PlayStation Visa Card earns at the following rates:\n- 5 points per dollar spent on qualifying PlayStation and Sony products when you shop directly, in store or at authorized retailers\n- 3 points for every dollar spent on cable, internet and streaming subscriptions\n- 2 points on dining and restaurants\n- 1 point for every $1 spent on all other eligible purchases\nThe card also comes with a welcome bonus of $100 statement credit after spending $500 within 60 days of account opening.\nRedeeming Rewards\nYou can only redeem the rewards on this card for more Playstation items, whether it\u2019s in-game or hardware. Plus, if you don\u2019t have any account activity for 24 months, you\u2019ll forfeit your points. Even with regular use of the card, rewards will expire after five years.\nRewards Potential\nForbes Advisor uses data from various government agencies to determine both baseline household income and spending averages across various categories. The 70th percentile of wage-earning households bring in $127,200 annually and can reasonably charge $40,398 to a credit card. We base our sample household spending on that number.\nPlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card* Rewards Potential\n| Category | Earning Rate | Estimated Annual Spend | Estimated Annual Earnings |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Purchases Made at PlayStation or the Sony Store | 5X | $1,300 | 6,500 |\n| Streaming and Internet | 3X | $1,476 | 4,428 |\n| Dining | 2X | $4,995 | 9,990 |\n| All Other Purchases | 1X | $32,627 | 32,627 |\n| Total: 53,545 points |\nThe rewards terms and conditions for this card say that redemption values will vary based on the specific redemption, so you won\u2019t know exactly what those points are worth to you until you\u2019ve decided what to use them for.\nFine Print\nInterest Rates\n- Regular APR: 18.24% - 32.24% variable APR\n- Purchase intro APR: N/A\n- Balance transfer intro APR: N/A\nFees\n- Annual fee: $0\n- Balance transfer fee: 5% of the amount of each transfer, $10 minimum\n- Foreign purchase transaction fee: 3% of the amount of each transaction\nHow the PlayStation Visa Card Stacks Up\n| Account Features | PlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card* | Blue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express | Prime Visa | Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card* |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Annual Fee | $0 | $0 (Terms apply, see rates & fees) | $0 | $0 |\n| Welcome Bonus | $100 statement credit after spending $500 within 60 days of account opening | $200 statement credit after spending $2,000 on purchases within the first 6 months | $150 Amazon gift card upon approval with an eligible Prime membership | $50 in Target Circle Rewards after spending $50 or more on qualifying purchases within 60 days of approval |\n| Standout Rewards | 5X points on PlayStation and Sony purchases | 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets, U.S. online retail purchases, and U.S. gas stations (on up to $6,000 in each category per year in eligible purchases, then 1%), and 1% cash back on other purchases. Cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit and at Amazon.com checkout | 5% back on Amazon spending with an eligible Prime membership | 5% off purchases at Target in-store or online |\n| Intro APR | None | 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and on balance transfers requested within 60 days of account opening, followed by a variable APR of 20.24% to 29.24%. A balance transfer fee of $5 or 3%, whichever is greater, applies | Get promotional financing in lieu of rewards | None |\n| Other perks | None | Up to $84 Disney Streaming Credit: Receive a $7 monthly statement credit after using your card to pay for an eligible auto-renewing Disney streaming subscription. Enrollment required, subject to auto-renewal. | Earn 10% back on a rotating selection of items on Amazon.com with an eligible Prime membership | Free 2-day shipping on select items; 30 additional days for returns and exchanges |\nPlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card* vs. Blue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express\nMost people will spend more on groceries, shopping and gas over the course of a year than on gaming. If that\u2019s the case for your budget, the no-annual-fee Blue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express (Terms apply, see rates & fees) will be a much more rewarding option. The card earns 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets, U.S. online retail purchases, and U.S. gas stations (on up to $6,000 in each category per year in eligible purchases, then 1%), and 1% cash back on other purchases. Cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit and at Amazon.com checkout. Since it\u2019s cash back, you\u2019ll know exactly the value of what you get back. It also comes with an intro offer of 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and on balance transfers requested within 60 days of account opening, followed by a variable APR of 20.24% to 29.24%. A balance transfer fee of $5 or 3%, whichever is greater, applies. That could be more valuable to you when buying an expensive PlayStation than just earning rewards that can only be used for more PlayStation-specific items.\nPlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card* vs. Prime Visa\nThe Prime Visa earns elevated rewards in many of the same categories as the PlayStation card, and more. You can fulfill many of your gaming needs on Amazon, from consoles to gaming chairs to PlayStation gift cards and earn 5% back. The card has no annual fee, but Prime membership of $14.99 per month or $139 per year is required to be eligible for the card and its top rewards.\nAll rewards earned can be redeemed as a cash-back statement credit, deposited into an eligible bank account or used to buy more stuff on Amazon. The more expansive bonus categories and more widely usable rewards make the Prime Card a better choice for most compared to the PlayStation Card.\nPlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card* vs. Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card*\nThe Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card* has no membership fees and offers an upfront 5% discount on Target purchases. You can fulfill most of your PlayStation or Sony needs via Target, plus you\u2019ll get free two-day shipping on select items and an extended 30-day return window on eligible purchases beyond the initial stated return period. That gives you a chance to try out new equipment to make sure it\u2019s right for you.\nTarget also carries just about anything you could want to buy for your home, which makes the Target Circle Card far more useful overall than the PlayStation Visa.\nAlternatives to the PlayStation Visa Card\nEvaluate Credit Cards Side By Side\nComplementary Credit Cards To Pair With PlayStation Visa Card\n| Card Name | Reason |\n|---|---|\n| It earns a straightforward 2% cash back on every purchase. It\u2019s one of the best 2% cash-back cards available (rates & fees). | |\n| At least one of the card\u2019s 5% rotating spending categories each quarter could be useful for PlayStation purchases |\nIs the PlayStation Visa Card Worth It?\nThe PlayStation Visa Card shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s primary credit card. But if you spend a significant chunk of your disposable income on PlayStation purchases, this card can earn you top rewards on purchases. Just know that several cards can offer better rewards overall along with more redemption flexibility. For most gamers, this is a case where the grass really is greener on the other side.\nMethodology\nForbes Advisor considers a variety of criteria when assigning credit cards a rating. Cards are graded based on numerous factors, including:\n- Annual fees\n- Welcome bonus offers\n- Ongoing earning rates\n- Value of individual rewards\n- Included travel or merchant credits\n- Additional cardholder benefits\nWe give greater weight to the card features we believe cardholders will use most frequently. These factors combine to generate a star rating for each card.\nTo learn more about our rating and review methodology and editorial process, check out our guide on how Forbes Advisor rates credit cards.\nTo view rates and fees for Blue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express please visit this page.\n*The information for the following card(s) has been collected independently by Forbes Advisor: PlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card, Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card.

      "text": "Our Verdict\nThe Prime Visa is a hard-to-beat option for Amazon Prime members who rely on the retailer for frequent shopping. Its high cash-back earnings and lack of annual fee (beyond the Prime membership you may be paying anyway) provide tremendous appeal.\nPros\n- 5% cash back on all Amazon and Whole Foods purchases\n- No spending required for the welcome bonus\n- No foreign transaction fees\n- Travel and shopping protections\n- Prime Big Deal Day benefits\nCons\n- Requires an Amazon Prime membership\n- No introductory APR\n- Low cash back for purchases outside of bonus categories\nCurrent Prime Visa Credit Card Offer\n- Get a $150 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval exclusively for Prime members\n- Earn unlimited 5% back at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market and on Chase Travel purchases with an eligible Prime membership\n- Prime Card Bonus: Earn 10% back or more on a rotating selection of items and categories on Amazon.com with an eligible Prime membership\n- Earn unlimited 2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and on local transit and commuting (including rideshare)\n- Earn unlimited 1% back on all other purchases\n- No annual credit card fee\n- No more waiting. Redeem daily rewards at Amazon.com as soon as the next day\n- Member FDIC\nWhat We Love About the Prime Visa\nBig Rewards With No Limits\nA surprising number of credit cards earn 5% cash back in one or more categories, but the Prime Visa is one of the few that doesn\u2019t impose spending limits. You won\u2019t be capped if you\u2019re a big spender: That 5% return applies to every purchase, with no activations or enrollments to remember.\nFinancing Opportunities\nInstead of a limited-time intro APR offer only available to new cardholders, the Prime Visa throws a unique spin on promotional financing. It offers interest-free, equal monthly payments for select purchases made at any time.\nCardholders will have six months to pay on eligible purchases over $50 from Amazon (or other merchants that accept Amazon Pay) and 12 months to pay for qualifying purchases of $250 or more. Purchases you pay off over time with equal monthly payments won\u2019t earn rewards, but the potential interest savings can make it worth giving up the points.\nOther Prime Visa Benefits\n- No foreign transaction fee. You won\u2019t pay a fee when you use your Prime Visa outside the U.S.\n- Extended warranty protection. The Prime Visa will extend eligible manufacturer warranties by an additional year if they are three years or less.\n- Purchase protection. New purchases are protected up to $500 per claim and $50,000 per account for 120 days.\n- Baggage delay insurance. Get reimbursed for toiletries, clothing and other luggage up to $100 per day for up to three days for baggage delays that exceed six hours.\n- Lost luggage reimbursement. If your or an immediate family member\u2019s checked or carry-on luggage is damaged or lost by the carrier, it\u2019s covered up to $3,000 per passenger.\n- Auto rental coverage. For rentals charged entirely to your card, you can decline the rental company\u2019s collision insurance to receive theft and damage coverage that\u2019s secondary to your personal insurance.\nWhat We Don\u2019t Love About the Prime Visa\nRequires a Prime Membership\nIf you\u2019re looking at this card, you might already have a Prime membership. But this card only makes sense if you continue to pay that membership fee year after year\u2014even if your shopping routines change or the cost of Prime goes up. You\u2019re downgraded to a lesser card if you ever choose to cancel your membership, which could be a downside in the future.\nStandard Earnings Are Low\nTo the card\u2019s credit, there are a fair number of bonus categories: Chase Travel, gas, local transit and commuting, and restaurants all earn at a decent rate. Unfortunately, that still leaves a long list of other purchases that only earn 1% cash back. That could make this card a poor choice for someone who only wants to rely on a single card for all their purchases.\nWho Is the Prime Visa For?\nIdeal For:\n- Frequent Amazon shoppers\n- Households that regularly buy groceries at Whole Foods\n- Occasional international travelers\nNot Ideal For:\n- Anyone seeking flexible rewards\n- Non-Prime members\nPrime Visa Rewards\nEarning Rewards\nThe Amazon Prime Visa earns:\nYou\u2019ll also instantly receive a $150 Amazon gift card upon approval with an eligible Prime membership.\nRedeeming Rewards\nYou can shop with your points at Amazon.com for faster access to your rewards. To pay with points, simply select the Prime Visa as your payment method at checkout. You\u2019ll then have the option to use your rewards points to cover some or all of your purchase. Alternatively, you can redeem your rewards for a statement credit or other cash equivalents.\nYou can also redeem your Prime Visa points for bookings made through Chase Travel or gift cards.\nRewards Potential\nForbes Advisor uses data from various government agencies to determine baseline household income and spending averages across various categories. The 70th percentile of wage earners bring in $127,200 annually, and we base our sample household spending on that number.\nAmazon Prime Visa Rewards Potential\n| Category | Earning Rate | Estimated Annual Spend | Estimated Annual Earnings |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Amazon.com Purchases | 5% | $8,906 | $445.30 |\n| Whole Foods | 5% | $3,100 | $155.00 |\n| Chase Travel Portal | 5% | $8,741 | $437.05 |\n| Gas Stations, EV Charging and Transit | 2% | $3,110 | $62.20 |\n| Dining | 2% | $4,995 | $99.90 |\n| All Other Purchases | 1% | $11,546 | $115.46 |\n| Total: $1,314.91 Cash Back |\nFine Print\nPrime Visa Interest Rates\n- Regular APR: 19.49% - 28.24% Variable\n- Purchase intro APR: N/A\n- Balance transfer intro APR: N/A\nPrime Visa Fees\n- Annual fee: $0\n- Balance transfer fee: Either $5 or 4% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater.\n- Foreign purchase transaction fee: $0\nHow the Prime Visa Stacks Up\n| Account Features | Prime Visa | Amazon Visa Credit Card* | U.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card* | Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Annual Fee | $0 (but $14.99 per month or $139 per year Prime membership required) | $0 | $0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $95 | $0 (rates & fees) |\n| Welcome Bonus | $150 Amazon gift card upon approval with an eligible Prime membership | $50 Amazon gift card instantly upon approval | $250 after spending $2,000 in eligible purchases within the first 120 days of account opening | $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months |\n| Amazon.com Rewards | Unlimited 5% back | Unlimited 3% back | Up to 6% back on up to $1,500 per quarter | Unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases |\n| Other Standout Rewards | 5% back on purchases at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market and on Chase Travel purchases with an eligible Prime membership, unlimited 2% back at gas stations, restaurants and on local transit and commuting (including rideshare), and unlimited 1% back on other purchases | 3% back at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market and on Chase Travel purchases, unlimited 2% back at gas stations, restaurants and on local transit and commuting (including rideshare), and 1% back on all other purchases | 6% cash back each quarter on combined eligible purchases from two retailers of choice ($1,500 limit), 5.5% cash back on prepaid car and hotel reservations booked through the Rewards Travel Center, 3% cash back each quarter in one everyday category of choice ($1,500 limit) and 1.5% cash back on everything else | 2% cash rewards on purchases |\n| Financing Options | Optional 0% promo APR for up to 12 months on qualifying purchases | Optional intro promo APR for up to 12 months on qualifying purchases | N/A | 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers, then a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR applies. Balance transfers made within 120 days qualify for the intro rate and fee of 3% (min. $5) then a fee of up to 5% (min. $5) applies |\nPrime Visa vs. Amazon Visa Credit Card*\nThe Amazon Visa Credit Card* comes with the advantage of not requiring a Prime membership fee, but the flipside to that is that you\u2019ll receive reduced rewards rates on all your Amazon, Whole Foods and Chase Travel purchases. This could be a fair option for less frequent Amazon shoppers. But if you\u2019re not that loyal to the Amazon ecosystem, you might be better off choosing a card that offers bonus cash back at multiple retailers or for all online shopping.\nPrime Visa vs. U.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card*\nThe U.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card* is a better choice for shoppers who buy across multiple online retailers. That\u2019s because you can select two stores each quarter that earn 6% returns on your first $1,500 in combined spending during that period (and, yes, Amazon.com is one of your options). The vast majority of other purchases earn 1.5%\u2014higher than the Prime Visa\u2014with a few bonuses available for qualifying travel and everyday spending categories. However, the card does have a modest annual fee, which could be off-putting to some.\nPrime Visa vs. Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card\nWith a flat 2% cash rewards on purchases, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card (rates & fees) provides simplicity unmatched by the Prime Visa. That\u2019s obviously a much lower rate than what you could earn on Amazon purchases with one of its co-branded credit cards, but it could still make sense if your spending habits are more varied. That\u2019s 2% cash rewards on purchases with no annual fee: gas, groceries, restaurants, travel and every retailer under the sun.\nAlternatives to the Prime Visa Credit Card\nEvaluate Credit Cards Side By Side\nIs the Prime Visa Worth It?\nThe Prime Visa is worth it if you\u2019re already a Prime member and shop regularly with Amazon or Whole Foods. The card\u2019s rewards rate delivers excellent value, especially since there are no spending limits. On the other hand, the Prime Visa might be too specialized for someone who only occasionally shops at Amazon or wants more flexible rewards and a wider swatch of bonus categories.\nComplementary Credit Cards To Pair With the Prime Visa\n| Card Name | Reason |\n|---|---|\n| Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express (Terms apply, see rates & fees) | Earn elevated grocery rewards at U.S. supermarkets, including at stores other than Whole Foods. |\n| Earn 2% cash rewards on purchases. |\nMethodology\nForbes Advisor considers a variety of criteria when assigning credit cards a rating.

If PlayStation gaming is a big part of your lifestyle, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a rewards card more suited to how you spend your disposable income.\nAlthough earning rewards to redeem for more PlayStation-related stuff is the main event with this card, it\u2019s worth noting that as a Visa card, the PlayStation\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card* comes with some basic Visa benefits including access to roadside dispatch and zero liability protection.\nXbox Mastercard*: Best Card for Xbox Gamers\nAnnual fee: $0\nWelcome bonus: Earn 6,000 card points, a $60 value, after completing your first purchase within the first 180 days of account opening.\nRewards: Earn 5X points on eligible digital Microsoft Store products, 3X points on eligible streaming services, 3X points on eligible dining delivery services and 1X points on other purchases.\nAvid Xbox gamers may want to consider applying for the Xbox Mastercard*. The card\u2019s rewards rates hit the bulls-eye for those who prefer a night of ordering in and streaming their favorite game, movie or show.\nIn addition to its rewards, the card includes three months of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription for new Game Pass Members who are approved for the card and make their first purchase within 180 days of opening their card account. Plus, get three months of Spotify Premium Individual after making your first purchase with the card. An Ultimate subscription starts at $19.99 a month, and a Spotify Premium membership is $11.99 per month, making this a sweet offer for a no annual fee card.\nThe rewards on this card effectively amount to a 5% discount every time you make an eligible Xbox or Microsoft purchase. You can redeem those rewards for a statement credit on eligible purchases made at xbox.com, Microsoft.com, on console or in-game at a value of a penny per point.\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card: Best Card for Gamers for Flat-Rate Rewards on Everything\nAnnual fee: $0 (rates & fees)\nWelcome bonus: Earn a $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months.\nRewards: Earn 2% cash rewards on purchases.\nEven the most devoted gamers may want to earn rewards they can use outside their preferred gaming platform. That\u2019s where the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card comes in. The card earns the same 2% cash rewards on everything you buy, gaming-related or not. Plus, those earnings can be taken as straight cash back to do whatever you like, rather than being locked into a redemption toward a narrow band of eligible purchases.\nIn addition to a relatively easy-to-attain welcome bonus, the card comes with a 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers, then a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR applies. Balance transfers made within 120 days qualify for the intro rate and fee of 3% (min. $5) then a fee of up to 5% (min. $5) applies. If you\u2019re trying to finance a large purchase or pay down some existing debt, this offer may ultimately be more valuable to you than earning rewards. The card also offers cellphone protection of up to $600 against eligible damage or theft (subject to a $25 deductible).\nTarget Circle\u2122 Credit Card*: Best Card for Consoles and Gift Cards\nAnnual fee: $0\nWelcome bonus: Earn $50 in Target Circle Rewards after spending $50 or more on qualifying purchases within 60 days of approval.\nRewards: Earn 5% off on purchases at Target in store or online purchases, plus earn 2% on dining and gas purchases and 1% everywhere else.\nRather than fuss with cash back, the Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card* gives you an upfront 5% discount off everything you buy in-store or online. Not only does that include just about anything physical you need to set up your perfect gaming space, (think consoles, headsets, chairs, speakers), but you can also enjoy that same discount on a wide array of gaming gift cards like Nintendo Switch, Twitch, PlayStation, Xbox and more.\nTwo unique perks of the card might be especially appealing to gamers: First, you\u2019ll get free two-day shipping on many items, making it a relatively quick fix if a controller, headset or other crucial piece of equipment needs a fast replacement. Additionally, cardholders get an extended 30-day return window on eligible items beyond the initial stated return period, giving them extra time to try out new accessories before committing to ownership.\nHow To Choose the Best Card for Gamers\nGamers who spend a bundle on their favorite pastime should choose a card that offers high rewards for that spending. Consider the following to help narrow down which card might be right for you:\n- Is there an annual fee? If a card has an annual fee, it will cut into any earnings you might get from making purchases with the card.\n- Do the rewards match the way you spend? Your goal in getting a new card for gaming is to gain as many benefits\u2014including rewards\u2014for that spending. If a card earns high rewards in areas you rarely spend, or if your highest expenses are for other things, it\u2019s probably not a fit.\n- Is your credit strong enough to qualify for the card? Most rewards cards require good or better credit to qualify. Make sure you have a sense of your credit standing before you apply for a card you\u2019re unlikely to be approved for.\n- Does the card have any gaming-specific benefits? Some of the best gaming cards offer discounts or free trials of gaming-related subscriptions, which can add significant value to owning a particular card.\n- Are there ongoing benefits outside of gaming? If a card offers an intro 0% APR period on purchases or balance transfers, that may be more valuable to you than savings on future gaming purchases.\nPros and Cons of Credit Cards for Gamers\nPros of Credit Cards for Gamers\n- You can access meaningful savings on gaming expenses. Earning rewards on a card that lets you redeem those earnings against your gaming expenses can keep more money in your pocket.\n- Some gaming cards offer extended warranty protection. Credit cards with extended warranty protection can cover eligible items beyond the standard product warranty period.\n- Most credit cards also offer zero fraud liability. Online fraud is rampant, but with a credit card that offers zero liability coverage, you won\u2019t be responsible for fraudulent purchases\nCons of Cards for Gamers\n- You may encounter reward gaps. If you spend on a specific game that isn\u2019t covered or specialty equipment that can\u2019t easily be found, a gaming card may not be right for you.\n- Your preferred card may not be a one-card solution. There\u2019s a good chance you aren\u2019t only spending on gaming. If you want to earn the most rewards overall, you may benefit from pairing your credit card for gaming with another card.\n- Other cards may offer valuable benefits outside of rewards. Rewards are nice, but you may benefit more from a card that offers purchase protection, extended warranty coverage or an intro 0% APR period.\nFind The Best Store Credit Cards Of 2025\nBottom Line\nCredit cards for gamers offer some targeted benefits, mainly rewards plus discounts or credits on related services. You\u2019ll generally get the most value from a gaming-oriented credit card by pairing it with another card offering bonus rewards for everyday expenses.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nShould I use a credit card for gaming purchases?\nUsing a credit card for your gaming purchases can be a good idea if the card earns rewards that you can use and if there are purchase protections or extended warranty coverage to protect what you buy. But, if you typically carry a balance, any rewards or other benefits will be negated by the double-digit interest rate you\u2019ll accumulate on the card.\nWhat kind of streaming and entertainment purchases count as a bonus category?\nThat will depend on the card and how the issuer classifies streaming. For example, some cards that offer bonus rewards in this category only count music and video as eligible streaming services. Entertainment as a category typically also does not include video game streaming or in-game purchases.\nAre there credit cards for gamers with bad credit?\nIf you have bad credit, the rewards cards on this list might not yet be within reach. For building credit, consider a secured credit card instead. These cards are often easier to qualify for because they require an upfront security deposit that protects the bank against the risk of cardholders defaulting on their debt."
