  "description": "Novak Djokovic thinks he came up with a way to get Serena Williams back on the tennis tour: Dare her to do it",
  "content": "Then he turned his thoughts to Williams, she of the 23 Grand Slam singles titles, one fewer than Djokovic\u2019s total.\n\nWilliams left tennis after playing at the 2022 U.S. Open, saying at the time she preferred to think of herself as \u201cevolving\u201d away from the sport rather than retiring.\n\n\u201cOf course, seeing Serena in any shape or form around tennis is great. You know, we miss her,\u201d Djokovic said, then added with a wry smile: \u201cShe still hasn\u2019t officially retired.\u201d\n\nAnd then he added: \u201cSo I invite her. I challenge her. Because she\u2019s such a great competitor, when somebody challenges her, she never refuses. So I challenge Serena: Come back on the tour next year.\u201d\n\nWilliams turns 44 next month. Her older sister, Venus, who is 45, will be playing in a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in two years at the U.S. Open on Monday night, after returning to the tour in July.",
