      "summary": "Russia and China have signed a legally binding memorandum to advance the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which will add about 50 billion cubic metres of annual supply to China via Mongolia. The existing Power of Siberia line will see its flow rise from 38 bcm to 44 bcm, while pricing for the new pipeline remains under negotiation, with China seeking discounts. The deal underscores China’s continued energy trade with Russia despite Western sanctions and reflects Russia’s pivot toward China after losing a large share of its European gas market.",
