  "title": "Benjamin Sesko: Manchester United reach agreement with RB Leipzig for striker",
  "description": "A deal consisting of an initial \u20ac76.5million plus \u20ac8.5m in add-ons has been accepted.",
  "content": "Manchester United have reached an agreement in principle with RB Leipzig for the signing of striker Benjamin Sesko.\n\nA deal worth \u20ac76.5million (\u00a366.4m; $89.1m) and \u20ac8.5m in add-ons is in place, with Sesko given permission to travel for medical tests ahead of the proposed move.\n\nThe Athletic reported on Wednesday that Manchester United were closing in on a move for the 22-year-old attacker after offering \u20ac75m and \u20ac10m of bonuses.\n\nNewcastle United have also pursued Sesko and saw a bid of \u20ac82.5m plus \u20ac2.5m in add-ons accepted by Leipzig on Tuesday.\n\nBut the Slovenia international favoured Manchester United and talks have advanced in an effort to satisfy Leipzig\u2019s expectations.\n\nThe Old Trafford club then finalised the operation in a relatively smooth and fast manner. They managed to secure a lower guaranteed fee than Newcastle and will be happy if the contingency payments are achieved.\n\nNewcastle initial tabled a proposal worth \u20ac75m and \u20ac5m, before raising that on Monday to at least \u20ac80m.\n\nWithin 24 hours, Manchester United came in at \u20ac75m plus \u20ac10m. Newcastle found a compromise with Leipzig but it became clear Sesko was leaning towards their Premier League rivals.\n\nThis comes despite Newcastle providing Champions League football in 2025-26.\n\nSesko scored 21 goals in all competitions for Leipzig last season and has recorded 39 goals and eight assists in 87 appearances for the Bundesliga team since joining from RB Salzburg in 2023.\n\nManchester United have already strengthened in forward areas via the additions of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.\n\nHow much will Manchester United\u2019s new attack cost?\n\nSpending a little over \u00a366m on Sesko takes United\u2019s summer outlay on guaranteed fees alone to \u00a3193.9m across three forwards, with a further \u00a313.4m potentially payable to clubs in future add-ons.\n\nTag on estimated agent fees and the four per cent transfer levy all Premier League clubs have to pay on incoming transfers, and their spending on new players is easily over \u00a3200m.\n\nIn that sense, this is just what we\u2019ve come to expect from United, both before and after Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s February 2024 arrival. Using financial years spanning July 1 to June 30, United spent \u00a3247.4m in 2022-23, \u00a3220.7m in 2023-24 and an enormous \u00a3343.5m in 2024-25 \u2014 the largest single-season spend in club history and the third largest in English football history (albeit that includes Matheus Cunha\u2019s arrival, as he signed up in June).\n\nAs with every transfer, United won\u2019t take the full hit of Sesko immediately, with his transfer costs spread across the duration of the contract he signs. But it all adds up to huge ongoing expenditure from a club whose transfer fee amortisation bill (the annual impact of spreading transfer fees) was already nearing \u00a3200m.\n\nUnited have fewer PSR troubles than once thought but cash has been rather tighter at Old Trafford recently. Payment terms on Sesko are unknown, but Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s deals are staggered across three and four instalments respectively, helping United manage liquidity. As well, as The Athletic detailed yesterday, there are other funding options available to the club to help foot a transfer bill which shows little sign of reducing.\n\nWhat will Sesko bring to Manchester United?\n\nThe 22-year-old Slovenian striker may be the biggest, roughest and shiniest diamond operating towards the top of Europe\u2019s top five leagues.\n\nThis summer marks the third time Manchester United have been interested, first assessing him in 2019 when he emerged at NK Domzale\u2019s senior team at 16, before monitoring him throughout the 2022-23 season, when he scored 16 goals in 30 games in the Austrian Bundesliga for Red Bull Salzburg.\n\nIn 2025, he has developed into a sledgehammer of a striker. He combines straight-line speed, powerful finishing and sheer bloody-mindedness to become a forward that centre-backs hate playing against.\n\nA speedy, 195cm/6ft 5in striker who spent a brief period tearing up the Austrian league before moving to the Bundesliga, Sesko has earned some comparisons to Erling Haaland. Sesko is not quite at that level, but has plenty of the raw materials to suggest he could reach it.\n\nHis shot map from 2023-24 illustrates a striker happy to go for goal wherever and whenever. Left foot, right foot, headers. Long-range cannons and plenty of pingers within the penalty box.\n\nSesko is a striker with sky-high potential, but there is a considerable risk when signing such a player for a club like Manchester United. He has the physical tools to adjust to life in the Premier League, but no one knows for sure whether he will have the \u2018above shoulders\u2019 temperament to deal with the scrutiny of life at Old Trafford.",

      "text": "Manchester United are closing in on a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.\nThe Old Trafford side have been battling Newcastle United for the 22-year-old striker, with both teams submitting offers.\nNewcastle initially tabled \u20ac75million plus \u20ac5m in add-ons, before raising that on Monday to at least \u20ac80m.\nWithin 24 hours, Manchester United made a proposal of their own worth \u20ac75m plus \u20ac10m.\nNewcastle have continued working to secure the transfer and on Tuesday a bid of \u20ac82.5m plus \u20ac2.5m was accepted by Leipzig.\nBut Sesko wants to join Manchester United and all parties are now aware of that, as talks advance in an effort to satisfy Leipzig\u2019s expectations. While there is no club-to-club agreement yet, the situation is moving in that direction.\nAdvertisement\nThe Slovenia forward\u2019s preference comes despite Newcastle\u2019s readiness to pay a higher fee and provide Champions League football.\nSesko\u2019s decision appears to have swung the situation in Manchester United\u2019s direction.\nSesko scored 21 goals in all competitions last season for Leipzig and has recorded 39 goals and eight assists in 87 appearances for the German club since signing from RB Salzburg in 2023.\nRuben Amorim\u2019s side also admired Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins and explored the costs of a potential deals when considering a move for Sesko. The Manchester United hierarchy was reluctant to pay what they thought it may have taken for Villa to consider doing business.\nUnited had shown interest in a deal for Liam Delap earlier this summer, but the striker opted to join Chelsea from Ipswich Town.\nThe club have also brought in forwards Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, while teenage left-back Diego Leon has joined from Cerro Porteno.\nAdditional reporting from Sebastian Stafford-Bloor\nMove brings Hojlund future into focus\nAnalysis by Mark Critchley\nA centre-forward was always a priority for Manchester United heading into this summer window given Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee contributed just seven goals to a total of 44 in the Premier League last season \u2014 the club\u2019s lowest tally of the post-1992 era.\nThat remained the case even after committing to spend at least \u00a3127.5m on the signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.\nSigning Sesko would take that figure close to \u00a3200m mark, perhaps over it. Wherever the final agreement with Leipzig lands, the fee will be substantially higher than the \u00a330m release clause of Liam Delap \u2014 Manchester United\u2019s priority target up front back in May.\nIn return for shelling out more than many expected, Ruben Amorim will have an entirely new front three at his disposal, although even he might point to gaps in the squad that Old Trafford\u2019s recruitment department need to address.\nAdvertisement\nManchester United have been assessing their options in midfield, with Amorim keen to add more dynamism in the middle of the park. A new goalkeeper has also been considered, albeit likely as an understudy.\nSales are still necessary to balance the spending so far, and securing exits for the four-man \u2018bomb squad\u2019 currently exiled under Amorim is important.\nBut Sesko\u2019s arrival would also bring Hojlund\u2019s future into focus, with Old Trafford hierarchy ready to consider offers of \u00a330m only two years after he joined for more than twice that figure.\nCertainly in terms of outgoings, Manchester United\u2019s business is far from done, and whether that paves the way for further incomings remains to be seen.\nNewcastle\u2019s summer of discontent continues\nAnalysis by George Caulkin\nWhere does this leave Newcastle? The answer to that is both simple and less simple.\nThe simple bit? It leaves them punch-drunk and reeling. In a summer of rejections or gazumping or both, it appears they have lost out on another high-profile player to a traditional \u201cbig-six\u201d club, with Sesko joining Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, James Trafford and Hugo Ekitike on a deflating list of misses.\nTo miss out on one or two would be understandable. It happens to everyone. To miss out on so many feels more like negligence, either a failure of preparation or execution.\nA makeshift recruitment team have been working to exhaustion. Jamie Reuben, the minority owner, has been doing the same, but with no sporting director or chief executive in place, this represents a failure of leadership. All roads lead back to Saudi Arabia and the club\u2019s ultimate owners.\nFor Newcastle to be in this position after a truly transformational season is inexcusable.\nThe less simple bit? What on earth do they do now, assuming Sesko moves to Old Trafford? There were already some huge unknowns, the biggest of which is what happens to Alexander Isak, who has been pushing for a move away from Newcastle and was the subject of a failed \u00a3110m bid from Liverpool last week.\nBuying Sesko would have offered Newcastle protection, giving them a young centre-forward of good quality, who could replace Isak if and when Liverpool met their valuation for the Sweden international or, far less likely, play alongside him.\nNot buying Sesko leaves them exposed. They already needed cover for Callum Wilson, who has joined West Ham United on a free transfer. In there here and now, they cannot possibly sanction Isak\u2019s departure, but is there any way back for him?\nAdvertisement\nSo, to return to the start \u2026 where does this leave Newcastle? With the season nearly upon them, it leaves them once again teetering on a precipice.\nWhy are Manchester United targeting Sesko?\nAnalysis by Carl Anka\nThe 22-year-old Slovenian striker may be the biggest, roughest and shiniest diamond operating towards the top of Europe\u2019s top five leagues.\nThis summer marks the third time Manchester United have been interested, first assessing him in 2019 when he emerged at NK Domzale\u2019s senior team at 16, before monitoring him throughout the 2022-23 season, when he scored 16 goals in 30 games in the Austrian Bundesliga for Red Bull Salzburg.\nIn 2025, he has developed into a sledgehammer of a striker.

      "text": "Manchester United fans have a favoured refrain, often given prominence during leaner times, one that ends with the view they\u2019re \u201cnever ignored\u201d. It is a maxim proving true this summer.\nOn the back of their worst domestic showing in half a century, with no European football on the horizon, staff numbers being scythed and, just five months ago, an owner claiming the club would have gone \u201cbust at Christmas\u201d without cost-cutting measures, one might have expected a quiet transfer summer at Old Trafford.\nNo chance.\nOnly two new faces have arrived, though Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo cost a combined \u00a3127.5million ($169.5m) in guaranteed transfer fees alone. Even with that spend and without permanent departures \u2014 though Marcus Rashford\u2019s loan to Barcelona does have a purchase option \u2014 United\u2019s name continues to crop up frequently in high-profile transfer discussions.\nFor all their recent malaise, they remain one of the preeminent clubs in world football, at least off the pitch.\nNow they are closing in on a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and on Wednesday evening The Athletic reported they have been exploring the conditions of a deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.\nBrighton have a history of getting good deals and have no intention of selling this summer, while like Cunha and Mbeumo before him, Sesko won\u2019t come cheap. After Newcastle United sent an improved bid to Leipzig on Monday, Manchester United followed up with their opening bid on Tuesday of \u20ac75million plus \u20ac10m in add-ons. Sesko\u2019s preference is to move to Manchester United.\nAdvertisement\nThat Manchester United can commit so much money to deals this summer might perplex some. As well as up front, the club have been considering their options in midfield \u2014 and in goal too, even as first-choice \u2018keeper Andre Onana is expected to stay put. At the same time, for all the talk of outgoings, nobody has yet been sold for any money this summer.\nNaturally, the question arises of how United can be so active. Even against a backdrop of tightening finances, United are pondering more big spending.\nWe say more not just because of Cunha and Mbeumo, but because of what has come before. Indeed, it is that \u2018before\u2019 that led minority owner Jim Ratcliffe to bemoan, as recently as March, United still having sizeable instalments to pay on transfers long since inked.\nCunha\u2019s signing was confirmed before United\u2019s June 30 year-end, meaning the \u00a371.3m total cost of bringing him in (according to the club\u2019s third-quarter financial report) fell into 2024-25 for accounting purposes. Add the \u00a3272.1m spent in the nine months to March 31 and United\u2019s outlay on player registrations last season rises to a staggering \u00a3343.5m \u2014 the third-highest single-season mark in English football history (though Liverpool may soon bump them to fourth). A reminder: transfer spending is expensed across the life of player\u2019s contract, so while United\u2019s squad cost increased by over \u00a3300m, the amounts spent in 2024-25 will have an impact on expenses \u2014 and, therefore, PSR results \u2014 for several years to come.\nIt represents United\u2019s highest single-season spend, though it is hardly out of character. They have spent more than \u00a3200m on new signings in each of the past three seasons, recouping comparatively little in return on sales. The \u00a366.3m earned last season was United\u2019s second-highest player sales figure in the past decade \u2014 they still spent a record \u00a3277m net last season.\nAdvertisement\nThat includes Cunha, so this season\u2019s spend is lower than if we look at a transfer window basis, but the overall sums United have spent in recent years are huge. They have contributed directly to the financial woes Ratcliffe aired this year and, correspondingly, the ongoing job cuts.\nAssessing a club\u2019s ability to spend in the modern age spans two areas: profit and sustainability rules (PSR) and the presence of, or access to, actual cash.\nUnited\u2019s purported PSR woes are less than once recently thought. As The Athletic revealed in June, that\u2019s in part because the club\u2019s PSR calculation is based on the results of Red Football Limited, stripping out some chunky costs at the PLC level that don\u2019t come under the sphere of football activity.\nFigures for last season aren\u2019t yet known, but The Athletic estimated United could have lost \u00a3141m in 2024-25 without incurring a breach of PSR. They didn\u2019t and, on the back of improved commercial and matchday income (offsetting a big drop in broadcast revenues) and a noteworthy drop in the wage bill, United likely still made a loss but a manageable one, at least in the context of the three-year \u00a3105m PSR limit.\nThough they will hope for a big improvement in the Premier League, United won\u2019t generate any TV money from Europe this year, and their continued high transfer spending won\u2019t help bring down a player amortisation bill nearing \u00a3200m a year.\nThere are, however, already elements helping reduce, or at least restrain, any 2025-26 losses. Rashford\u2019s departure might not have brought in a transfer fee but will save \u00a314m in wages this season.\nUnited have not sold anyone yet but they have benefited from others selling their former players \u2014 moves involving Alvaro Carreras, Anthony Elanga and Maxi Oyedele have earned them more than \u00a320m in sell-on fees. A further \u00a35m has arrived from Chelsea after they failed to turn Jadon Sancho\u2019s loan move into a permanent deal, though that sum will be eaten into if Sancho isn\u2019t sold this summer, as United are now back on the hook for his full wage.\nThose transactions help United\u2019s bottom line, and, depending on the timing of payments in those deals that have spawned sell-on fees, could also help their cash position. In truth, it\u2019s that, rather than too many PSR woes, that provides the clearest limiting factor on United keeping up their heady rate of transfer spending.\nAdvertisement\nProjecting United\u2019s PSR headroom for 2025-26 is tricky (or foolish) as it requires estimating two full years of financials at a club undergoing significant change, particularly for expenditure. Yet based on United\u2019s third-quarter earnings statement, a loss last season in line with 2022-23\u2019s deficit doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. That result drops off the PSR calculation this season, one figure replacing the other.\nIn other words, our estimate of their ability to lose \u00a3141m in 2024-25 without a PSR breach could hold true again for this season.\nPast spending could catch up with them in other ways. United\u2019s net transfer debt \u2014 instalments owed to clubs, less those owed from clubs \u2014 has exploded in recent years, from below \u00a3100m in June 2021 to \u00a3308.9m at the end of March.\nThe signings of Cunha and Mbeumo have only added to the sum, with each of their fees spread over instalments. That is better in the immediate term than having to fork out nearly \u00a3130m immediately (and so widens the scope for United to spend more this summer), but then they already owed a significant amount in fees soon \u2014 at the end of March, net transfer payments owed before the end of March 2026 stood at \u00a3175.5m. The three-year payment term of the Cunha deal also came after United had unsuccessfully sought five years of instalments, a clear sign of their need to be careful with cash.\nUnited have also invested in infrastructure recently, the Carrington Training Complex being the most obvious example, all of which further squeezes cash. The club\u2019s cash balance was \u00a373.2m at the end of March, even after \u00a3238.5m of equity injections from Ratcliffe. That\u2019s still a lot of cash by most clubs\u2019 standards, but then United aren\u2019t most clubs. They have a lot of bills to pay.\nUnited have held a few revolving credit facilities (RCFs \u2014 effectively, corporate overdrafts that aid day-to-day liquidity) for a while, though they only started dipping into them to deal with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Surprisingly, at the end of April, they paid off \u00a350m of their existing RCF borrowings.\nIn a roundabout way, that gave them extra borrowing scope this summer. On April 28, following the \u00a350m repayment, United had drawn down \u00a3160m across their three RCFs, which have \u2014 or at least had \u2014 an overall combined limit of \u00a3300m. At the end of April, therefore, United could draw down a further \u00a3140m if they chose to, though of course they would be on the hook for extra interest costs in doing so.\nAdvertisement\nActivity since the third quarter report was filed on June 6 is unknown and won\u2019t be confirmed until the club\u2019s full year 2024-25 accounts are published. But on July 10, a new charge was registered against various United entities at Companies House in favour of Bank of America, which already acts as the security trustee across the existing \u00a3300m of RCFs.\nA year ago, on 28 June 2024, a linked charge was filed, as United extended a \u00a3150m tranche of the RCF to expire in June 2027. The new charge suggests a further time extension related to the RCFs, or it is possible that United have increased their borrowing capacity, drawing down even more than the \u00a3140m we know was available to them at the end of April.\nWhen contacted by The Athletic, the club declined to comment on the matter, other than to state any changes to the nature or size of the RCFs would be detailed in the club\u2019s 2024-25 annual accounts, expected to be published in September.\nSeparately, there\u2019s also the point of those staffing cuts and other cost-saving measures having a tangible effect on cash flow. Savings might be a drop in the ocean compared to if United could get rid of millions in player salaries at the drop of a hat, but they can\u2019t, and the amount of redundancies since Ratcliffe\u2019s arrival will clearly have an impact.\nUnited also projected adjusted EBITDA (an accounting measure they use as a proxy for operating performance) for 2024-25 in the \u00a3180m-\u00a3190m range, a marked increase on 2023-24\u2019s \u00a3147.7m, which should have translated to stronger operating cash flows last season.\nEven now, United can still spend if they wish to. Cash needs to be rather more carefully managed than was the case in the past at Old Trafford, but a combination of recent actions and the club\u2019s continued ability to borrow, if they wish to, means there are avenues available to them.\nStill, it is expected, both inside and outside the club, that sales will be made. It isn\u2019t controversial to say United need to improve at selling, having lagged behind peers for a long while. That ballooning transfer debt is proof enough of their need to get better at player trading \u2014 and there\u2019s no time like the present.\nAdvertisement\nAlejandro Garnacho and Antony are the most obvious candidates for sales that might make United decent money this summer. Meanwhile, the prospect of Sesko arriving increases the chance of Rasmus Hojlund departing just two years into his five-year deal.\nHojlund signed from Atalanta for an initial \u00a364m that, after tagging on agent fees and the Premier League\u2019s transfer levy, leaves his current book value at \u00a343m. United will consider offers of \u00a330m (though the player has said he wants to stay). That would be an eight-figure loss for PSR purposes \u2014 but could generate some useful cash.\nAdditional reporting: Mark Critchley and Laurie Whitwell\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"

Despite Newcastle United's higher bid, Sesko preferred a move to Manchester United, leading to advanced talks to satisfy Leipzig's expectations. This transfer is part of a significant summer spending spree for United, which has already seen them invest heavily in new forwards.",
