  "content": "Four prized Mets prospects are getting closer to the majors.\n\nJett Williams, Jonah Tong, Carson Benge and Ryan Clifford were all promoted to Triple-A Syracuse on Monday. MLB Pipeline ranks each within the Mets\u2019 top seven prospects.\n\nWilliams, a middle infielder and center fielder, is considered the Mets\u2019 No. 1 prospect. The 21-year-old hit .281 with 10 home runs, an .867 OPS and 32 stolen bases in 96 games with Double-A Binghamton this year.\n\nThe righty-swinging Williams was the Mets\u2019 first-round pick in 2022.\n\nTong, 22, is the Mets\u2019 top pitching prospect and their No. 2 prospect overall. The right-hander went 8-5 with a 1.59 ERA and 162 strikeouts in 102 innings over 20 starts at Double-A.\n\nBenge, a lefty-hitting outfielder and the Mets\u2019 No. 4 prospect, batted .317 with eight homers and an .978 OPS in 32 games with Double-A after being promoted in June.\n\nThe fast-rising 22-year-old was the Mets\u2019 first-round pick last year.\n\nAnd Clifford, a lefty-swinging outfielder and first baseman, hit .243 with 24 homers and an .848 OPS in 105 games at Double-A. The Mets acquired Clifford in the 2023 trade that sent Justin Verlander to Houston.\n\nTong, in particular, has generated considerable excitement. The 2022 seventh-round pick leads the minors in strikeouts and hurled five innings of one-run ball on Sunday against Somerset, the Yankees\u2019 Double-A affiliate.\n\n\u201cStanding at 6-foot-1, Tong can look like the second coming of Tim Lincecum with his deceptive over-the-top delivery and good extension,\u201d reads MLB Pipeline\u2019s scouting report of Tong. \u201cHis fastball only shows average velocity in the 91-94 mph range, but it plays well above that with elite induced vertical break.\u201d\n\nTong and Benge both took part in the All-Star Futures Game in Atlanta last month.\n\nSix of the Mets\u2019 top seven prospects are now at Triple-A, with the newly called-up quartet joining right-handed starters Nolan McLean (No. 3) and Brandon Sproat (No. 5).\n\nSproat has spent all season at Triple-A, pitching to a 4.10 ERA in 22 starts.\n\nMcLean, meanwhile, was promoted to Triple-A in May and boasts a 2.78 ERA in 16 appearances, including 13 starts, at that level.\n\nMets fans have become increasingly eager for Sproat and McLean, both of whom are 24, to come up to the majors, especially as the MLB staff has struggled to give the team length in recent months. On Sunday, the Mets (63-55) suffered their seventh loss in a row and their 11th in their last 12 games.\n\nBut last week, president of baseball operations David Stearns explained why Sproat and McLean had not been called up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a combination of when, developmentally, those guys are ready, and also when there\u2019s the need and how to fit it on the roster,\u201d Stearns said.\n\n\u201cWe may get to the point where we decide that it\u2019s the best thing to do to bring one or both of them here, but we\u2019re not at that point quite yet.\u201d\n\nTriple-A Syracuse begins a six-game homestand against Indianapolis, the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 Triple-A affiliate, on Tuesday night.",
