  "content": "A federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump unlawfully leaned on emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs earlier this year.\n\n\u201cBecause we agree that (the International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u2019s) grant of presidential authority to \u2018regulate\u2019 imports does not authorize the tariffs imposed by the Executive Orders, we affirm,\u201d the Federal Circuit said in an unsigned opinion upholding a lower-court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nA federal court ruled in May that Trump did not have the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping tariffs. The Trump administration immediately appealed the decision, setting the course for a legal battle over the economic policy that Trump promises will re-focus the American economy on manufacturing, but could raise prices for small businesses and consumers.\n\nA three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade blocked all tariffs invoked under IEEPA, the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs Trump announced on April 2, and the tariffs placed earlier this year against China, Mexico and Canada that were designed to combat fentanyl coming into the United States. Notably, the order did not include the 25% tariffs on autos, auto parts, steel or aluminum, which were under a different law, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

      "text": "A federal court on Wednesday ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have raised the cost of imports for everyone from giant businesses to everyday Americans.\nBut the administration immediately appealed the decision on Wednesday night, leaving the situation uncertain for consumers and companies and potentially prolonging the battle over whether Trump\u2019s import duties will stand \u2013 and possibly reshape the global economy.\nA three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade, a relatively low-profile court in Manhattan, stopped Trump\u2019s global tariffs that he imposed citing emergency economic powers, including the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs he announced on April 2. It also prevents Trump from enforcing his tariffs placed earlier this year against China, Mexico and Canada, designed to combat fentanyl coming into the United States.\nThe court ruled in favor of a permanent injunction, potentially grinding Trump\u2019s global tariffs to a halt before \u201cdeals\u201d with most other trading partners have even been reached. The court ordered a window of 10 calendar days for administrative orders \u201cto effectuate the permanent injunction.\u201d That means the bulk \u2013 but not all \u2013 of Trump\u2019s tariffs would be put in a standstill if the ruling holds up in appeal and, potentially, with the Supreme Court.\nThe order halts Trump\u2019s 30% tariffs on China, his 25% tariffs on some goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and the 10% universal tariffs on most goods coming into the United States. It does not, however, affect the 25% tariffs on autos, auto parts, steel or aluminum, which were subject to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act \u2013 a different law than the one Trump cited for his broader trade actions.\nStock futures surged on the ruling. Dow futures rose nearly 500 points, or 1.1%. The broader S&P 500 futures were up 1.4%, and Nasdaq futures were 1.6% higher in afterhours trading.\nThe lawsuit was filed by the libertarian legal advocacy group Liberty Justice Center in April and represented wine-seller VOS Selections and four other small businesses that claimed they had been severely harmed by the tariffs. The panel came to a unanimous decision, publishing an opinion on the VOS suit and also one by twelve Democratic states brought against the Trump tariffs.\n\u201cWe won \u2013 the state of Oregon and state plaintiffs also won,\u201d Ilya Somin, a law professor at Scalia Law School, George Mason University and plaintiff lawyer, said to CNN immediately after the ruling. \u201cThe opinion rules that entire system of liberation day and other IEEPA (International Emergency Economic Powers Act) tariffs is illegal and barred by permanent injunction.\u201d\nDeclaring a national economic emergency\nOn April 2, Trump announced his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, imposing significant levies on imports from some of America\u2019s closest trading allies \u2013 though he soon after implemented a 90-day pause on April 9. He left in place \u201cuniversal\u201d 10% tariffs on most goods coming into the United States.\nTrump implemented these tariffs without Congress by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to act in response to unusual and extraordinary threats. But the law does not include any mention of tariffs as a potential action the president can take once IEEPA is invoked.\nTrump also cited IEEPA in his 20% tariffs on China and 25% tariffs on many goods from Mexico and Canada designed to target fentanyl trafficking into the United States.\nBut the Trump administration has not met that criteria for an emergency, the plaintiffs alleged. The lawsuit also alleges IEEPA doesn\u2019t give the president the power to enact tariffs in the first place, and even if it was interpreted to, it \u201cwould be an unconstitutional delegation of Congress\u2019s power to impose tariffs,\u201d according to a statement.\nThe court concurred in its ruling that Trump lacked the authority to impose those tariffs even after declaring a national emergency.\n\u201cIEEPA does not authorize any of the worldwide, retaliatory, or trafficking tariff orders,\u201d the panel of judges said in their order Wednesday. \u201cThe worldwide and retaliatory tariff orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs. The trafficking tariffs fail because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders.\u201d\n\u2018Surprising and spectacular\u2019 decision\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that: \u201cIt is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.\u201d\nWhite House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller was blunter, posting on X that \u201cThe judicial coup is out of control\u201d in response to the news.\nGary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, called it a \u201csurprising and spectacular decision.\u201d\n\u201cThe reason it\u2019s a surprise is that if you look at past cases where plaintiffs have tried to challenge the presidential use of extraordinary authority under various laws, the plaintiffs have always lost against the government,\u201d Hufbauer said in an interview with CNN.\n\u201cAll the president had to do was say, \u2018national security,\u2019 or \u2018national emergency.\u2019 Those are magic words.\u201d\nThe decision could help small businesses across America, many of which had been struggling with the jump in costs from tariffs.\n\u201cThis is potentially \u2013 with that word choice underscored \u2013 a significant policy pivot point should it hold up for both the economy and the quiet majority inside Congress that does not support current trade policy,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist, wrote in an email to CNN Business. \u201cIn particular, this would provide a huge relief for small and medium sized firms that neither have the margins nor the financial depth to absorb the tariffs on a sustained basis.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs are hopeful they can gain some certainty for their businesses, Jeffrey Schwab, lead attorney for the Liberty Justice Center, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday.\n\u201cThey\u2019re hopeful that these will be upheld by the appellate court so that they can continue their businesses with the certainty of what\u2019s going to happen rather than the uncertainty of not knowing what the tariff rate is at any given time and whether it will change,\u201d Schwab said.\n\u201cObviously this is a very important case, not only because of the tremendous economic impact that it has on everybody, but particularly business and our businesses, but also because of the tremendous power grab that the administration is claiming here,\u201d Schwab continued. \u201cHe can\u2019t just assert unlimited authority to tariff whenever he wants.\u201d\nPotentially headed to the Supreme Court\nThe Department of Justice lawyers argued that the tariffs are a political question \u2013 meaning it\u2019s something that the courts can\u2019t decide.\nBut the plaintiffs noted IEEPA makes no mention of tariffs.\n\u201cIf starting the biggest trade war since the Great Depression based on a law that doesn\u2019t even mention tariffs is not an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative power, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d Somin said in April.\nSeparately, and using similar arguments, twelve Democratic states sued the administration in the same court for \u201cillegally imposing\u201d tax hikes on Americans through the tariffs.\n\u201cWe brought this case because the Constitution doesn\u2019t give any president unchecked authority to upend the economy. This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can\u2019t be made on the president\u2019s whim,\u201d Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement Wednesday.\nThe judges on the Manhattan panel were each appointed by a different president. Judge Jane Restani was appointed to the US Court of International Trade by President Ronald Reagan. Judge Gary Katzmann was appointed to the court by President Barack Obama. Judge Timothy Reif was appointed by President Trump.\nThe immediate higher court is the federal circuit, though it could potentially go right to the Supreme Court.\nThe United States Court of International Trade is a federal court in Manhattan that handles disputes over customs and international trade laws.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan, Rashard Rose, Mary Kay Mallonee and Alicia Wallace contributed reporting."

  "argos_summary": "A federal appeals court ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by imposing sweeping tariffs, blocking the tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada, and universal 10% tariffs, while leaving Section\u202f232 tariffs intact. The decision followed a lower\u2011court injunction and could be appealed to the Supreme Court, potentially reshaping trade policy and raising costs for businesses. Stock futures rose after the ruling, reflecting market optimism that the tariffs would be halted. The case underscores the limits of executive power in trade and may influence future tariff actions and U.S. trade relations.",
