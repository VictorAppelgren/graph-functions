  "title": "Raw politics now drives enforcement at the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights division",
  "description": "The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department has been accused of manipulating federal law enforcement to further the president\u2019s political agenda, by pressuring Texas to re-gerrym\u2026",
  "content": "The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department has hit a new low in manipulating federal law enforcement to further the president\u2019s political schemes. On July 7, 2025, the DOJ wrote the Texas governor a letter pressuring him to re-gerrymander Texas\u2019s already discriminatory congressional map. Texas obliged, triggering a potential nationwide race to the bottom as states seek to imitate Texas\u2019s gambit or counteract it with their own gerrymandering.\n\nIn June 2025, with the president\u2019s tiny House majority at risk in the midterm elections, the Trump White House asked Texas to redraw the Texas congressional map to yield more Republican House seats. Less than a month later, the head of the Civil Rights Division followed up with the Texas governor, claiming that four majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The DOJ\u2019s letter demanded that Texas redistrict, or the DOJ could sue.\n\nNormally, before advancing a serious and difficult charge like racial gerrymandering, the Civil Rights Division conducts a careful preliminary investigation. It seeks information from the state and consults with voters and advocates. Here, it appears, no meaningful inquiry occurred, which is not surprising. There were only three lawyers left in the Voting Section. The rest were driven out by the new leadership\u2019s hostility to civil rights and anyone who had tried to protect them.\n\nThe legal rationale in the letter, moreover, was feeble; it argued that under a recent Fifth Circuit ruling in Petteway v. Galveston County, coalition districts, where different minority groups combine to form a majority, \u201crun afoul [of] the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d That is not even close to the court\u2019s holding. The court interpreted Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to allow discrimination claims by a racial minority that has a majority in a district, but not claims by minority groups that join together to form a majority. The case does not address racial gerrymandering, much less suggest that \u201ccoalition districts\u201d violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe sham legal rationale could not camouflage that the DOJ was instructing Texas to dismantle congressional districts where minority voters held a majority. The Supreme Court has suggested that deliberately breaking up coalitions with minority voters raises \u201cserious questions under both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\u201d\n\nPreviously, the DOJ and private plaintiffs (including the Texas NAACP, represented by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law) sued Texas alleging that its 2021 redistricting plan discriminated against people of color \u2014 notinfavorof them. When the case was tried in May and June 2025, the state\u2019s witnesses, despite damning statistical evidence, repeatedly denied under oath that race played any role in its redistricting. Nevertheless, DOJ\u2019s racial accusations led the governor to include redistricting in a special legislative session on July 21. And the governor said explicitly that he was targeting coalition districts \u2014 a purposeful, focused effort to reduce representation of minority voters.\n\nStrikingly, in the ongoing litigation on the 2021 redistricting plan, the DOJ dropped its discrimination claims in March 2025, six months after the Pettewaydecision on coalition districts. In doing so, the department never even hinted that the Democratic, majority minority districts it disparaged in the July 7 letter were racially gerrymandered to favor minorities.\n\nSo, what happened between March and July 7 to prompt such extraordinary new allegations of racial gerrymandering in the 2021 plan? Plainly, not an investigation. Nor any change in the law. Pettewaywas old news. And not any significant factual revelations. The only relevant intervening event was Donald Trump\u2019s call for redistricting in Texas to help him politically in the House in November 2026.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division\u2019s attempt to further the president\u2019s political scheme was sordid and reprehensible, especially given Texas\u2019s long history of racial discrimination in voting. At least since Watergate, the Justice Department has tried to insulate its legal judgments from political influence and to shield investigatory decisions from partisanship. Attorney General Edward Levi, appointed by President Ford to restore the Justice Department\u2019s integrity after Watergate, warned that: \u201cNothing can more weaken the quality of life or more imperil the realization of the goals we all hold dear than our failure to make clear by words and deed that our law is not an instrument of partisan purpose.\u201d\n\nApparently, the current leadership of the Civil Rights Division does not agree. They appear to regard themselves as White House staffers executing Donald Trump\u2019s personal agenda, even extending that role to nonpartisan career employees.\n\nThe political manipulation reflected in the July 7 letter and its inversion of the Division\u2019s anti-discrimination mission reflects this approach. And there is no reason to believe the malfeasance will stop with Texas or redistricting, as Trump seeks new ways to undermine the electoral system. The approach is wrong and destructive. It demeans standards that have guided the department for at least 50 years. It undermines the department\u2019s credibility and effectiveness. And it threatens our democracy.\n\nAs Attorney General Levi warned, the law cannot be \u201can instrument of partisan purpose.\u201d The Justice Department must reclaim its independence.\n\nRobert N. Weiner is the Voting Rights Project director at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

      "text": "Trump tells Texas Republicans to redraw the state congressional map to help keep House majority\nTrump tells Texas Republicans to redraw the state congressional map to help keep House majority\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he is pushing Texas Republicans to redraw the state\u2019s congressional maps to create more House seats favorable to his party, part of a broader effort to help the GOP retain control of the chamber in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe president\u2019s directive signals part of the strategy Trump is likely to take to avoid a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House just two years into his presidency. It comes shortly before the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature is scheduled to begin a special session next week during which it will consider new congressional maps to further marginalize Democrats in the state.\nAsked as he departed the White House for Pittsburgh about the possibility of adding GOP-friendly districts around the country, Trump responded, \u201cTexas will be the biggest one. And that\u2019ll be five.\u201d\nTrump had a call earlier Tuesday with members of Texas\u2019 Republican congressional delegation and told them the state Legislature would pursue five new winnable seats through redistricting, according to a person familiar the call who was not authorized to discuss it. The call was first reported by Punchbowl News.\nSome Texas Republicans have been hesitant about redrawing the maps because there\u2019s only so many new seats a party can grab before its incumbents are put at risk. Republicans gain new seats by relocating Democratic voters out of competitive areas and into other GOP-leaning ones, which may then turn competitive with the influx.\n\u201cThere comes the point where you slice the baloney too thin and it backfires,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nDemocrats will have a hard time retaliating\nCongressional maps drawn after the 2020 census were expected to remain in place through the end of the decade. If Texas redraws them at the behest of Trump, that could lead other states to do the same, including those controlled by Democrats. In response to the Texas plan, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media: \u201cTwo can play this game.\u201d\nStill, Democrats may have their hands at least partly tied. Many of the states the party controls have their state legislative and congressional maps drawn by independent commissions that are not supposed to favor either party. That\u2019s the case in California, where Newsom has no role in the redistricting game after voters approved the commission system with a 2008 ballot initiative.\nNewsom on Tuesday afternoon floated the notion of California\u2019s Democratic-controlled Legislature doing a mid-decade redistricting and arguing it wouldn\u2019t be expressly forbidden by the 2008 ballot initiative. Democrats already hold 43 of the state\u2019s 52 House seats. He also proposed squeezing in a special election to repeal the popular commission system before the 2026 elections get underway, but either would be an extraordinary long shot.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a whole lot Democrats can do right now,\u201d said Michael Li of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cIn terms of doing tit-for-tat, they\u2019ve got a weaker hand.\u201d\nLi noted that Democrats are backing lawsuits to overturn some GOP-drawn maps, and there\u2019s a chance some of those could be successful before the midterm elections. That includes in Wisconsin, where the new liberal majority on the state supreme court declined to immediately overturn the state\u2019s GOP-drawn congressional maps earlier this year. Democrats and their allies have filed suit in a lower court hoping to beat the clock and get new maps in place by next year.\nDemocrats also have litigation in Utah and Florida.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case out of Louisiana that seeks to unravel one majority Black district mandated by the Voting Rights Act. The case could lead to sweeping changes in longstanding rules requiring mapmakers to ensure that racial minorities get a chance to be an electoral majority or plurality in some areas.\nThe high court is expected to rule in that case by next summer.\nRe-opening maps undermines \u2018free and fair elections\u2019\nRedistricting is a constitutionally mandated process for redrawing political districts after the once-a-decade census to ensure they have equal populations. But there is no prohibition against rejiggering maps between censuses, and sometimes court rulings have made that mandatory. The wave of voluntary mid-decade redistricting that Trump is encouraging, however, is unusual.\nIt\u2019s also left some Democrats fuming that their party has ceded much its mapmaking power to independent commissions in states it controls, including Colorado, Michigan and Washington.\n\u201cReformers often do not understand the importance of political power,\u201d said Rick Ridder, a Democratic strategist in Denver.\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries wouldn\u2019t comment on whether nonpartisan systems should be rolled back, instead saying Trump\u2019s push will \u201cundermine free and fair elections.\u201d\n\u201cPublic servants should earn the votes of the people that they hope to represent. What Republicans are trying to do in Texas is to have politicians choose their voters,\u201d Jeffries told reporters.\nDemocratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, whose district includes part of Austin, also criticized Texas Republicans for focusing on redistricting after floods killed at least 132 people, and with more still missing.\n\u201cRedistricting, this scheme, is an act of desperation,\u201d he said.\nTexas lawmakers will consider a new map during special session\nThe special Texas legislative session scheduled to start Monday is intended to focus primarily on the aftermath of the deadly floods.\nAn agenda for the session set by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott put forth plans to take up \u201clegislation that provides a revised congressional redistricting plan in light of constitutional concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d\nRepublicans in Ohio also are poised to redraw their maps after years of political and court battles over the state\u2019s redistricting process. The GOP-controlled Legislature is considering expanding the party\u2019s lead in the congressional delegation to as much as 13-2. It currently has a 10-5 advantage.\nStill, there are practical limits as to how many new seats any party can squeeze from a map. That\u2019s why some Texas Republicans have been hesitant about another redraw. In 2011, the party\u2019s legislators drew an aggressive map to expand their majority, only to find seats they thought were safe washed away in the 2018 Democratic wave election during Trump\u2019s first term.\nIn response, the map in 2021 was drawn more cautiously, mainly preserving the GOP\u2019s current outsized majority in its congressional delegation. There are 25 Republican House members from the state compared to 12 Democrats and one Democratic vacancy that is scheduled to be filled by a special election. A five-seat shift into the GOP column would mean the party holds 30 of Texas\u2019 38 seats after winning 56% of the vote in last year\u2019s presidential election.\nBoth parties see potential advantages\nIn Austin, Republican lawmakers said they embrace the opportunity to redraw maps.\nState Rep. Brian Harrison, who served in the first Trump administration, said lawmakers can do it in a way that\u2019s \u201cthoughtful and constructive.\u201d\n\u201cThis is something that we can do, and something that we should do,\u201d\nGOP Texas Sen. John Cornyn said he expects a new map will lead to \u201csignificant gains,\u201d in part because Latino voters have been trending toward Republicans in recent elections.\nBut Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Tuesday that there was no way to redraw the boundaries without exposing more GOP incumbents to a possible Democratic wave. When a party wins the White House, it usually loses seats in the midterms.\n\u201cAny new map that Texas Republicans draw will almost inevitably create more competitive districts,\u201d DelBene told reporters. \u201cThis scheme to rig the maps is hardly going to shore up their majority. It is going to expand the battleground in the race for the majority.\u201d\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the name of the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n___\nAssociated Press Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro in Washington and writers Nadia Lathan in Austin, Texas, and Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report."

Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 3 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 The issue in this en banc case is whether Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act authorizes coalitions of racial and language minorities to claim vote dilution in legislative redistricting. In an increasingly multiracial and multi-language polity, the importance of this issue is obvious. We overrule this court\u2019s decision in Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1988), and its progeny, which allowed such claims to be maintained. In 2021, the Galveston County Commissioners Court enacted a new districting plan for county commissioner elections. The enacted plan eliminated the county\u2019s sole majority-minority precinct, which had existed since 1991. The majority-minority population in that precinct was composed of two distinct minority groups, blacks and Hispanics. In 2022, three sets of plaintiffs challenged the enacted plan in federal court, claiming that it diluted the votes of a coalition of black and Hispanic voters in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. See 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301. The district court conducted a bench trial and rendered judgment in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor. In doing so, it applied this court\u2019s decision in Campos v. City of Baytown, which held that distinct minority groups may aggregate their populations for purposes of vote dilution claims under Section 2. 840 F.2d at 1244. This holding was critical to Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 2 claim because neither the black population nor the Hispanic population of Galveston County is large enough on its own to \u201cconstitute a majority\u201d in a reasonably configured county commissioner precinct. See Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50, 106 S. Ct. 2752, 2766 (1986) (describing this first precondition to vote dilution claims under Section 2).1 _____________________ 1 Contrary to repeated statements in Judge Douglas\u2019s dissent, the issue of intentional discrimination was not part of the district court\u2019s Section 2 ruling. The court withheld ruling on that constitutional issue, which we remand for further consideration. 3 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 4 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 The panel decision affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment but called for the en banc court to reconsider Campos\u2019s holding authorizing what are often called \u201cminority coalition claims.\u201d Having vacated the panel opinion for rehearing en banc, we conclude that coalition claims do not comport with Section 2\u2019s statutory language or with Supreme Court cases interpreting Section 2, particularly Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 129 S. Ct. 1231 (2009). We OVERRULE Campos, REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment, and REMAND for further proceedings. I. Background A. Factual Background According to the 2020 census, Galveston County, Texas, has a total population of 350,682. The citizen voting-age population of the county is 58 percent white, 22.5 percent Hispanic, and 12.5 percent black. The Hispanic population is evenly dispersed throughout the county, while the black population is concentrated in the center of the county, i.e., in Texas City, La Marque, Dickinson, Hitchcock, and the city of Galveston. Galveston County is governed by a county commissioners court, which consists of one county judge, elected county-wide, and four county commissioners elected from single-member precincts. See TEX. CONST. art. V, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 18(b). The current county judge is a Republican. Three of the commissioners are also Republicans, and one is a Democrat. One of the Republican commissioners is a black man. The only Democrat, Commissioner Stephen Holmes, is also a black man. Commissioner Holmes represents Precinct 3. From 1991 to 2021, Precinct 3 was the county\u2019s only majority-minority precinct, and its borders encompassed the center of the county. The majority-minority population of Precinct 3 was composed of both black and Hispanic citizens of voting age. 4 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 5 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 As of 2020, blacks and Hispanics together amounted to 58 percent of the precinct\u2019s citizen voting-age population. The county undertook redistricting efforts in 2021 after receiving the 2020 census data. Two redistricting maps, or plans, were proposed during the redistricting process. Map 1, a \u201cminimal change\u201d plan, retained Precinct 3 as a majority-minority precinct, with a 31 percent black and 24 percent Hispanic citizen voting-age population. Map 2, an \u201coptimal change\u201d plan, did not contain a majority-minority precinct and reduced the minority population of Precinct 3 to the lowest of the four precincts. The Commissioners Court voted to enact Map 2. Only Commissioner Holmes voted against the enacted plan. The Petteway Plaintiffs, the NAACP Plaintiffs, and the United States challenged the enacted plan in federal court. All three sets of plaintiffs claimed that the enacted plan violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by diluting the votes of Galveston County\u2019s black and Hispanic voters. The Petteway Plaintiffs and NAACP Plaintiffs also pleaded that the enacted plan was (1) intentionally discriminatory in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and (2) racially gerrymandered in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Following a ten-day bench trial, the district court found that the enacted plan violated Section 2 and enjoined Galveston County from using the plan. \u201c[T]he enacted plan,\u201d the district court wrote, \u201cillegally dilutes the voting power of Galveston County\u2019s Black and Latino voters by dismantling Precinct 3, the county\u2019s historic and sole majority-minority commissioners precinct.\u201d In reaching this decision, the district court followed Campos, 840 F.2d at 1244, which allows distinct minority groups to aggregate their populations when alleging vote dilution under Section 2. The district court declined to reach the intentional discrimination and racial gerrymandering 5 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 6 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 claims brought by the Petteway Plaintiffs and NAACP Plaintiffs because the relief they requested with respect to those claims was no broader than the relief they were entitled to under Section 2. Galveston County appealed. Following the original appellate panel\u2019s recommendation, this court voted to rehear the case en banc and subsequently stayed the district court\u2019s remedial orders pending resolution of en banc proceedings. 86 F.4th 1146 (5th Cir. 2023). B. Legal Background Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides: (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 10303(f)(2) of this title, as provided in subsection (b). (b) A violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301. 6 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 7 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Subsection (a) of the quoted statute incorporates by reference Section 4(f)(2) of the Voting Rights Act, codified at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10303(f)(2). That provision prohibits discrimination in voting against \u201clanguage minorities,\u201d which the Act elsewhere defines as \u201cpersons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage.\u201d Id. \u00a7 10310(c)(3). The 1975 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act added the protections for language minorities, who were not covered under the original version of the Act (enacted in 1965). See Pub. L. No. 94\u201373, 89 Stat. 400 (1975). The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act added subsection (b) to Section 2. Pub. L. No. 97\u2013205, 96 Stat. 131 (1982). The new subsection was Congress\u2019s response to the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial decision in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which held that proof of discriminatory intent was required for vote dilution claims under both the Fifteenth Amendment and Section 2 as it was then written. 446 U.S. 55, 61\u201365, 100 S. Ct. 1490, 1496\u2013 98 (1980). Subsection (b) abrogated Bolden\u2019s holding as to Section 2 by adopting the \u201cresults test\u201d from the leading pre-Bolden vote dilution case, White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 766, 93 S. Ct. 2332, 2339 (1973). See S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 2 (1982). In 1986, the Supreme Court decided Thornburg v. Gingles, which provides the framework for analyzing vote dilution claims under Section 2 today. 478 U.S. 30, 106 S. Ct. 2752. The Gingles Court specified three preconditions that a minority group must prove to succeed on a vote dilution claim. \u201cFirst, the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a [reasonably configured] single-member district.\u201d Id. at 50, 106 S. Ct. at 2766. \u201cSecond, the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive.\u201d Id. at 51, 106 S. Ct. at 2766. And \u201c[t]hird, the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d Id., 106 S. Ct. at 2766\u201367. 7 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 8 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 If these three preconditions are established, the minority group must then show that, \u201cbased on the totality of circumstances,\u201d the electoral process is not \u201cequally open\u201d to its members. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b). This final step of the analysis entails considering several factors, often called the Senate factors because they originated from the Senate Judiciary Committee Report accompanying the 1982 Amendments. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36\u201337, 106 S. Ct. at 2759 (citing S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 28\u201329); see also Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l Comm., 594 U.S. 647, 668\u201375, 141 S. Ct. 2321, 2338\u201341 (2021). The primary issue here concerns the first Gingles precondition, which requires the minority group to be sufficiently large to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured single-member district. The Supreme Court has not decided whether distinct minority groups may aggregate their populations to satisfy this requirement. It expressly declined to do so on at least two occasions. See Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 41, 113 S. Ct. 1075, 1085 (1993) (\u201c[a]ssuming (without deciding) that it was permissible for the District Court to combine distinct ethnic and language minority groups for purposes of assessing compliance with \u00a7 2,\u201d and then holding that the coalition had failed to prove cohesion under the second Gingles precondition); Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 13\u201314, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 1242\u201343 (2009) (plurality opinion) (\u201cWe do not address [coalition claims] here.\u201d). This court first held that distinct minority groups may aggregate their populations under Section 2 in LULAC v. Midland I.S.D., 812 F.2d 1494, 1500\u201301 (5th Cir. 1987). Judge Higginbotham dissented, disagreeing with the panel\u2019s holding on aggregation. Id. at 1504. The panel opinion was later vacated on rehearing en banc, and the en banc court decided the case on different grounds. 829 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1987). Midland I.S.D. thus no longer serves as the operative precedent on coalition claims in this circuit. 8 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 9 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Instead, the operative precedent is Campos v. City of Baytown, decided a year later. 840 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir. 1988). In Campos, this court upheld a district court\u2019s finding that the City of Baytown\u2019s at-large election system for city council diluted the votes of a coalition of black and Hispanic voters in violation of Section 2. On the propriety of coalition vote dilution claims under Section 2, the court reasoned only that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the law that prevents the plaintiffs from identifying the protected aggrieved minority to include both Blacks and Hispanics.\u201d Id. at 1244. It explained that Section 2 protects the voting rights of both racial and language minorities. Id. \u201cIf, together, they are of such numbers residing geographically so as to constitute a majority in a single member district, they cross the Gingles threshold as potentially disadvantaged voters.\u201d Id. Further, to satisfy the second Gingles precondition, there must be proof that the coalition \u201ctogether votes in a cohesive manner for the minority candidate.\u201d Id. at 1245. Thus, \u201cif the statistical evidence is that Blacks and Hispanics together vote for the Black or Hispanic candidate, then cohesion is shown.\u201d Id. Judge Higginbotham, joined by five other judges, dissented from denial of rehearing en banc in Campos, again disagreeing with the panel\u2019s holding on minority coalitions. 849 F.2d 943, 944\u201346 (5th Cir. 1988). Five years after Campos, this court, sitting en banc, decided LULAC v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831 (5th Cir. 1993). Judge Higginbotham wrote the opinion for the court, which held that a coalition of black and Hispanic voters who challenged Texas\u2019s election system for trial judges failed to prove vote dilution under Section 2. Notably, the Clements court did not \u201crevisit\u201d whether distinct minority groups may aggregate their populations under Section 2. Id. at 864. It instead relied on precedent, explaining that \u201cwe have treated the issue as a question of fact, allowing aggregation of different minority groups where the evidence suggests that they are politically cohesive.\u201d Id. A 9 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 10 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 concurring opinion would have decided the case solely on the ground that coalition claims are impermissible. Id. at 894\u201398 (Jones, J., concurring). Only one other circuit court has thoroughly analyzed the issue before this court today. Sitting en banc, the Sixth Circuit created a circuit split by concluding that Section 2 does not authorize minority coalition vote dilution claims. Nixon v. Kent Cnty., 76 F.3d 1381, 1387 (6th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA textual analysis of \u00a7 2 reveals no word or phrase which reasonably supports combining separately protected minorities.\u201d). The court\u2019s opinion relied heavily on dissenting and concurring opinions from judges of this court in the cases described above. The Eleventh Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in an earlier opinion that followed, without reasoning, this court\u2019s precedent. See Concerned Citizens of Hardee Cnty. v. Hardee Cnty. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 906 F.2d 524, 526 (11th Cir. 1990) (\u201cTwo minority groups (in this case blacks and hispanics) may be a single section 2 minority if they can establish that they behave in a politically cohesive manner.\u201d (citing Campos, 840 F.2d at 1244, and Midland I.S.D., 812 F.2d at 1500\u201302)). As a three-judge district court in Georgia recently observed, it would be inaccurate to characterize the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision as containing a holding that coalition claims are permissible under Section 2, because the court ultimately held against the coalition on other grounds. Ga. State Conf. of the NAACP v. Georgia, No. 1:21-cv-05338ELB-SCJ-SDG, 2023 WL 7093025, at *16 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 26, 2023). Finally, the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have resolved cases involving minority coalitions without discussing or deciding whether coalition claims are permissible. See Pope v. Cnty. of Albany, 687 F.3d 565, 572 & n.5 (2d Cir. 2012) (affirming denial of preliminary injunction for coalition of black and Hispanic voters because voters failed to show likelihood of success on third Gingles precondition); Bridgeport Coal. for Fair Representation v. City 10 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 11 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 of Bridgeport, 26 F.3d 271, 278 (2d Cir.) (holding that coalition of black and Hispanic voters were entitled to preliminary injunction), vacated, 512 U.S. 1283, 115 S. Ct. 35 (1994); Frank v. Forest Cnty., 336 F.3d 570, 575\u201376 (7th Cir. 2003) (calling coalition claims \u201cproblematic,\u201d but ultimately rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 coalition claim for lack of political cohesion); Badillo v. City of Stockton, 956 F.2d 884, 890\u201391 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that coalition of black and Hispanic voters lacked evidence of political cohesion). Plaintiffs are wrong to characterize these cases as holding that coalition claims are permissible under Section 2. Opinions that \u201cnever squarely addressed [an] issue\u201d and \u201cat most assumed the\u201d answer are not precedential \u201cby way of stare decisis.\u201d Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 631, 113 S. Ct. 1710, 1718 (1993). II. Discussion After reconsidering Campos en banc, this court holds that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not authorize separately protected minority groups to aggregate their populations for purposes of a vote dilution claim. The analysis that leads to this conclusion is divided into five sections. We explain first that minority coalition claims are inconsistent with the text of Section 2. Second, because the statutory text is clear, we need not address the legislative history, but Plaintiffs\u2019 argument based on pre-1982 cases involving minority coalitions is meritless in any event. Third, coalition claims are inconsistent with Supreme Court cases rejecting similar \u201csub-majority\u201d vote dilution claims, especially Bartlett v. Strickland. Fourth, other considerations, including the poor track record of coalition claims thus far and their tension with the proviso against proportional representation and with the purposes of the Voting Rights Act, also disfavor continuing to recognize coalition claims. And fifth, stare decisis does not require us to adhere to our erroneous decision in Campos. 11 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 12 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 A. Statutory Text The text of Section 2 does not authorize coalition claims, either expressly or by implication. \u201cIt is well established that \u2018when the statute\u2019s language is plain, the sole function of the courts\u2014at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce it according to its terms.\u2019\u201d Lamie v. U.S. Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 534, 124 S. Ct. 1023, 1030 (2004) (quoting Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6, 120 S. Ct. 1942, 1947 (2000)). Nowhere does Section 2 indicate that two minority groups may combine forces to pursue a vote dilution claim. On the contrary, the statute identifies the subject of a vote dilution claim as \u201ca class,\u201d in the singular, not the plural. Section 2(b)\u2019s results test requires a showing that the electoral processes \u201care not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\u201d 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b) (emphasis added). Twice after, the subsection uses the phrase \u201ca protected class.\u201d \u201cHad Congress chosen explicitly to protect minority coalitions it could have done so by defining the \u2018results\u2019 test in terms of protected classes of citizens. It did not.\u201d Clements, 999 F.2d at 894 (Jones, J., concurring). Nor can \u201ca class\u201d be read to encompass two distinct minority groups. \u201c[A] class\u201d under Section 2(b) is defined according to the characteristic that all its members share, and by virtue of which its members are \u201cprotected by subsection (a).\u201d The defining characteristics for purposes of Section 2 are race, color, or membership in one of several language minority groups. Section 2(a) makes this clear by tying the statute\u2019s protection of voting rights to the particular race, color, or language minority status of individual citizens. As the Sixth Circuit observed in Nixon, \u201cThe Act protects a citizen\u2019s right 12 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 13 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 to vote from infringement because of, or \u2018on account of,\u2019 that individual\u2019s race or color or membership in a protected language minority.\u201d2 76 F.3d at 1386 (citing provision now codified at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(a)); see also 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10303(f)(2) (prohibiting states and political subdivisions from \u201cdeny[ing] or abridg[ing] the right of any citizen of the United States to vote because he is a member of a language minority group\u201d (emphasis added)). Two individuals who do not share the same defining characteristic are not members of the same \u201cclass\u201d; they are members of two distinct classes, and their vote dilution claims must be analyzed separately.3 _____________________ 2 The Nixon court also points out that the only place where the Voting Rights Act referenced potential minority group aggregations rejected them. Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1387 n.7 (citing Section 4(f)(3) of the Voting Rights Act, currently codified at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10303(f)(3) (providing that foreign language ballots and other voting materials must be furnished only where \u201ccitizens of a single language minority\u201d constitute at least 5 percent of the citizen voting age population of a political subdivision)). I disagree with the dissent\u2019s contention that this limit inferentially supports Section 2(b) coalition claims. The provisions have completely different goals. Section 4(f)(3) requires local officials to print ballots in a foreign language only if at least 5 percent of the minority are dependent on that language; any other rule would provide no guideline and no limit on the tedious and costly process of printing foreign language ballots. Section 4(f)(3) demonstrates that there may be logical stopping points to accommodate \u201cclasses\u201d of voters. Section 2(b), on the other hand, tackles the far more complex political problem of legislative redistricting, and it models pre-existing non-aggregated case law and nonaggregated civil rights legislation. 3 The lead dissent from the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Nixon argued that this interpretation imposes a \u201cracial purity test\u201d for Section 2 claims. 76 F.3d at 1401 (Keith, J., dissenting). This is not a credible concern today. See, e.g., Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 473 n.1, 123 S. Ct. 2498, 2507 n.1 (2003) (recognizing that litigants may rely on the \u201cAny Part Black\u201d metric in defining the class of voters seeking protection under the Voting Rights Act), superseded by statute on other grounds, Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-246, 120 Stat. 577; Robinson v. Ardoin, 37 F.4th 208, 217 (5th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[T]he district court did not err by using the \u2018Any Part Black\u2019 metric to calculate BVAP [black voting age population].\u201d). 13 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 14 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 This reading of the statute is not mere surmise. The second sentence of Section 2(b) provides, \u201cThe extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered\u201d when determining whether the electoral process is not equally open to members of the class. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b). An inquiry into the electoral success of \u201ca protected class\u201d makes sense only if it is restricted to a specific racial or language-minority group. For example, black voters in San Antonio would hardly be persuaded that a vote dilution claim lacked merit simply because whites, a minority in the majority-Hispanic city, were being elected to local office.4 Nor would Hispanics in Houston see citywide elected black politicians as evidence against any dilution of Hispanic votes. The election of black officials would be an irrelevant \u201ccircumstance\u201d in determining whether a state or political subdivision is diluting the strength of Hispanic voters. Section 2(b)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cprotected class\u201d also supports our interpretation. In discrimination law, this phrase is typically used to acknowledge membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, when racial discrimination is alleged. See, e.g., Alkhawaldeh v. Dow Chem. Co., 851 F.3d 422, 426 (5th Cir. 2017) (describing prima facie case of employment discrimination under Title VII as requiring proof that the plaintiff \u201c(1) is a member of a protected class, (2) was qualified for the position that he held, (3) was subject to an adverse employment action, and (4) was treated less favorably than others similarly situated outside of his protected class\u201d). It is membership in the discrete racial or ethnic group that triggers protection and guides analysis of whether the plaintiff has been discriminated against. So too here. _____________________ 4 Cf. United States v. Brown, 561 F.3d 420 (5th Cir. 2009) (affirming finding of intentional vote dilution against white voters under Section 2). 14 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 15 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 None of Plaintiffs\u2019 textual arguments to the contrary is convincing. First, Plaintiffs urge us to read \u201ca class of citizens protected by subsection (a)\u201d to encompass all voters who claim a violation of the right protected by subsection (a), regardless whether they share the same race. This argument relies in part on the last antecedent grammatical rule, \u201caccording to which a limiting clause or phrase [here, the phrase \u2018protected by subsection (a)\u2019] should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows [here, \u2018citizens\u2019 rather than \u2018class\u2019].\u201d See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26, 124 S. Ct. 376, 380 (2003). As the Supreme Court has explained, however, \u201cthis rule is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\u201d Id. Section 2 provides other indicia of meaning by using \u201cprotected class\u201d as shorthand for \u201ca class of citizens protected by subsection (a).\u201d In the shorthand form, \u201cprotected\u201d plainly modifies \u201cclass,\u201d not \u201ccitizens.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation also relies in part on Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs class actions. The United States contends that the term \u201cclass\u201d in Section 2(b) should be read \u201cin Rule 23\u2019s sense,\u201d to mean \u201ca group of individuals with a common injury and legal position.\u201d But Rule 23\u2019s sense of class does not transfer neatly to Section 2. After all, the object of Section 2(b) is to determine whether \u201ca protected class\u201d has suffered injury. Defining the class in terms of injury begs the question whether the class is \u201cprotected by subsection (a)\u201d in the first place. And the answer to that question is determined by the individual characteristic of race, color, or language minority status, not by injury. Moreover, Rule 23 provides a procedural device to a class of persons with legal claims provided by other, underlying substantive law, whereas Section 2(b) is itself a source of that substantive law for members of a protected class. Next, Plaintiffs invoke the Dictionary Act to argue that \u201cclass\u201d should be read as \u201cclasses.\u201d The Dictionary Act provides, \u201cIn determining the 15 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 16 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise\u2014 words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things. . . .\u201d 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. For reasons identified above, in Section 2 \u201cthe context indicates otherwise.\u201d It is clear from Section 2(b)\u2019s second sentence (concerning the electoral successes of a protected class), for instance, that \u201ca protected class\u201d encompasses only one class, not multiple racial or language minority classes. Finally, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 111 S. Ct. 2354 (1991), Plaintiffs argue that an expansive interpretation of Section 2 is warranted by the statute\u2019s broad remedial purpose. In Chisom, the Supreme Court held that Section 2 applies to the election of judges, even though the statute refers only to \u201crepresentatives.\u201d In doing so, the Court observed that the Voting Rights Act was enacted for the broad remedial purpose of eliminating racial discrimination in voting and \u201cshould be interpreted in a manner that provides \u2018the broadest possible scope\u2019 in combating\u201d such discrimination. Id. at 403, 111 S. Ct. at 2368 (citation omitted). Chisom does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the statute. The Supreme Court recently emphasized that \u201cvague notions of a statute\u2019s \u2018basic purpose\u2019 are . . . inadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the specific issue under consideration.\u201d Montanile v. Bd. of Trs. of Nat\u2019l Elevator Indus. Health Benefit Plan, 577 U.S. 136, 150, 136 S. Ct. 651, 661 (2016) (quoting Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 261, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 2071 (1993)). In this case, nothing in the text of Section 2 supports a conclusion that distinct minority groups may aggregate their populations; the text, in fact, supports the opposite conclusion. Nor does anything in the statutory history of Section 2 support aggregation. That distinguishes the interpretative question in this case from the one in Chisom. As the Sixth Circuit explained: 16 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 17 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 In Chisom, it was \u201cundisputed that \u00a7 2 applied to judicial elections prior to the 1982 Amendment.\u201d . . . Unlike Chisom, here it is undisputed that the Voting Rights Act has never permitted coalition suits by its terms, and that no mention is made of them anywhere in the legislative history. Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1389 (quoting Chisom, 501 U.S. at 390, 111 S. Ct. at 2361). Congress\u2019s silence on the aggregation issue, textually and otherwise, ultimately means that minority vote dilution coalitions are impermissible. Campos got things precisely backwards when it held that coalition claims are permissible merely because Section 2 does not expressly prohibit them. 840 F.2d at 1244. It is Congress\u2019s failure to expressly authorize coalition claims that is dispositive of the issue. See Campos, 849 F.2d at 945 (Higginbotham, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (\u201cPlaying with the structure of local government in an effort to channel political factions is a heady game; we should insist that Congress speak plainly when it would do so.\u201d); see also Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 858, 134 S. Ct. 2077, 2089 (2014) (\u201c[I]t is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain of Congress\u2019 intent before finding that federal law overrides the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)). That Congress did not even impliedly authorize coalition claims\u2014but instead impliedly prohibited them\u2014underscores the error in Campos\u2019s holding. The statutory text points to only one conclusion, that coalition claims are impermissible. B. Legislative History Plaintiffs and Galveston County each contend that the legislative history accompanying the 1975 and 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act favors their respective interpretations of Section 2. The parties\u2019 arguments 17 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 18 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 are uniformly weak, \u201cnicely prov[ing] th[e] point\u201d that legislative history \u201con the whole, [is] more likely to confuse than to clarify.\u201d Conroy v. Aniskoff, 507 U.S. 511, 519, 113 S. Ct. 1562, 1567 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis removed). Fortunately, we need not address these arguments at all, because the text of Section 2 is clear. See Adkins v. Silverman, 899 F.3d 395, 403 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[W]here a statute\u2019s text is clear, courts should not resort to legislative history.\u201d (citing BedRoc Ltd. v. United States, 541 U.S. 176, 183, 124 S. Ct. 1587, 1593 (2004))). One argument that overlaps with Plaintiffs\u2019 legislative history arguments is, however, worth addressing, in part because it received attention during oral argument. Plaintiffs and their Amici contend that the legislative history shows that Congress was aware of cases involving coalition claims and yet chose not to include a single-race requirement. This purportedly demonstrates that Congress intended to authorize coalition claims. See Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1395 (Keith, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf Congress was thus aware that more than one minority group could be considered to constitute one plaintiff class in determining the availability of Voting Rights Act protection, certainly the absence of an explicit prohibition of minority coalition claims compels a construction of Section 2 which allows them.\u201d). This argument is riddled with distortion and error. The cases on which it is based include White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S. Ct. 2332 (1973), Graves v. Barnes, 408 F. Supp. 1050 (W.D. Tex. 1976), Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S. Ct. 603 (1964), and United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S. Ct. 996 (1977). Unsurprisingly, none of these cases is cited in the legislative history for the proposition that coalitions of minority voters are protected from vote dilution under Section 2 or under the Constitution. Nor do any of the cases hold that coalition claims are permissible as a statutory or constitutional matter. Nor do any of them involve vote dilution claims under Section 2. 18 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 19 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Indeed, White did not involve a coalition claim at all. There, the Supreme Court held that one multimember district encompassing Dallas County, Texas, diluted the votes of black voters, and that a separate multimember district encompassing Bexar County diluted the votes of Hispanic voters. 412 U.S. at 765\u201370, 93 S. Ct. at 2339\u201341. Graves, a continuation of the White lawsuit on remand, did involve a coalition claim, under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, but it did not address whether such claims are permissible.5 408 F. Supp. at 1052. Wright also involved a coalition claim, again under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, but it too did not address whether such claims are permissible and in fact held against the minority coalition. 376 U.S. at 53, 58, 84 S. Ct. at 604, 606. Finally, Carey only tangentially involved a coalition of minority voters. The plaintiffs in that case were Hasidic Jews, and only Hasidic Jews; they unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of a redistricting plan that had been revised after the Attorney General objected, during Section 5 preclearance, to the original redistricting plan\u2019s alleged dilution of the \u201cvoting strength of nonwhites (blacks and Puerto Ricans).\u201d 430 U.S. at 149\u201350, 97 S. Ct. at 1002. That none of these cases interpreted or even applied Section 2 defeats any statutory stare decisis argument based on Supreme Court precedent.6 To _____________________ 5 The three-judge district court in Graves reaffirmed its holding in an earlier (vacated) decision that single-member districts were required in Tarrant County, Texas, because multimember districts diluted the votes of black and Hispanic voters there. For the earlier decision, see Graves v. Barnes, 378 F. Supp. 640, 644\u201348 (W.D. Tex. 1974), vacated sub nom. White v. Regester, 422 U.S. 935, 95 S. Ct. 2670 (1975). The Supreme Court summarily denied an application for stay of the district court\u2019s 1976 decision. See Escalante v. Briscoe, 424 U.S. 937, 96 S. Ct. 1404 (1976). This stay denial by the Supreme Court is minimally informative. See Trevor N. McFadden & Vetan Kapoor, The Precedential Effects of the Supreme Court\u2019s Emergency Stays, 44 Harv. J.L. Pub. Pol\u2019y 827, 849 (2021) (\u201c[D]ecisions by either a single Justice or the full Court to deny a stay application cannot have any precedential or persuasive effect.\u201d). 6 Statutory stare decisis receives further attention in Section II.E, below. 19 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 20 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 be sure, the pre-1982 Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment cases that Plaintiffs cite are still potentially relevant to interpreting Section 2. Even in the absence of legislative history, \u201c[w]e assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,\u201d Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 32, 111 S. Ct. 317, 325 (1990); and Congress, in 1982, clearly was aware of existing (or pre-existing) voting rights law, since it drew the relevant language of Section 2(b)\u2019s results test from White. Yet this helps Plaintiffs very little. None of the pre-1982 cases that Plaintiffs cite decided, as a matter of law, whether coalition claims are permissible. The issue evidently never was presented. \u201cQuestions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\u201d Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S. Ct. 148, 149 (1925). Coalition claims were, therefore, not part of the existing body of law with which Congress had to contend in 1982, and the argument that Congress impliedly authorized such claims by failing to include a single-race qualifier in Section 2 is meritless. C. Supreme Court Precedent Supreme Court precedent also disfavors Plaintiffs\u2019 preferred interpretation of Section 2. As explained above, the first Gingles precondition requires proof that the minority group is sufficiently large to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured single-member district. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50, 106 S. Ct. at 2766. On two occasions, the Supreme Court has rejected Section 2 plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to circumvent this requirement, which the Plaintiffs in this case again attempt to circumvent. In LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 126 S. Ct. 2594 (2006), the Court held that Section 2 does not require the creation of \u201cinfluence districts.\u201d Influence districts are those in which a minority group cannot elect the candidate of its choice because of its sub-majority numbers, but the group may still 20 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 21 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 play an influential role in the electoral process. The Court held that the ability of members of a minority group to influence an election in a district was insufficient to state a claim for vote dilution under Section 2. \u201cThe opportunity \u2018to elect representatives of their choice,\u2019 requires more than the ability to influence the outcome between some candidates, none of whom is their candidate of choice.\u201d Id. at 445, 126 S. Ct. at 2625 (citing provision now codified at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b)). The more important case for present purposes, however, is Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 129 S. Ct. 1231 (2009), which answered a question that the Court had previously reserved, viz., whether Section 2 requires the creation of \u201ccrossover districts.\u201d See Perry, 548 U.S. at 443, 126 S. Ct. at 2624; Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 154, 113 S. Ct. 1149, 1155 (1993). Crossover districts are those in which a minority group makes up less than a majority of the voting-age population but \u201cis large enough to elect the candidate of its choice with help from voters who are members of the majority and who cross over to support the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13, 129 S. Ct. at 1242. The Bartlett Court held that Section 2 does not require the creation of such districts. The plurality opinion7 explained that crossover districts are inconsistent with Section 2 and with the Gingles preconditions. Section 2 requires a showing that minorities \u201chave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to . . . elect representatives of their choice.\u201d Id. at 14, 129 S. Ct. at 1243 (quoting provision now codified at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b)). When, _____________________ 7 Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concurred in the judgment, arguing, \u201cThe text of \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 does not authorize any vote dilution claim, regardless of the size of the minority population in a given district.\u201d Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 26, 129 S. Ct. at 1250. 21 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 22 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 however, a minority group constitutes less than a majority of the citizen voting-age population in a reasonably configured district, it has \u201cno better or worse opportunity to elect a candidate than does any other group of voters with the same relative voting strength.\u201d Id. The group cannot elect its preferred candidate on its own; it would need assistance from other voters, \u201cincluding other racial minorities, or whites, or both.\u201d Id. (emphases added). \u201cRecognizing a \u00a7 2 claim in this circumstance would grant minority voters \u2018a right to preserve their strength for the purposes of forging an advantageous political alliance\u2019\u201d with voters outside the minority group. Id. at 14\u201315, 129 S. Ct. at 1243 (quoting Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421, 431 (4th Cir. 2004)). But \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 2 grants special protection to a minority group\u2019s right to form political coalitions.\u201d Id. at 15, 129 S. Ct. at 1243 (\u201c[M]inority voters are not immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground.\u201d (quoting Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1020, 114 S. Ct. 2647, 2661 (1994))). Indeed, unless the minority group can show that it has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice in a single-member district, \u201cthere neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy\u201d under Section 2. Id. (quoting Growe, 507 U.S. at 41, 113 S. Ct. at 1084).8 The Bartlett plurality then expressly reaffirmed the first Gingles precondition, which requires proof that the minority group is large enough to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured single-member district. The alternatives proposed by proponents of crossover claims would be unworkable, wrote the plurality, as they \u201cwould place courts in the untenable position of predicting many political variables and tying them to race-based _____________________ 8 Although not pertinent here, the Bartlett plurality also observed that allowing crossover claims would be in tension with the third Gingles precondition. Id. at 16, 129 S. Ct. at 1244 (\u201cIt is difficult to see how the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be met in a district where, by definition, white voters join in sufficient numbers with minority voters to elect the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d). 22 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 23 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 assumptions.\u201d Id. at 17, 129 S. Ct. at 1244. The majority-minority rule established by Gingles, by contrast, provides \u201can objective, numerical test: Do minorities make up more than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the relevant geographic area?\u201d Id. at 18, 129 S. Ct. at 1245.9 Each of these reasons articulated in Bartlett for rejecting crossover claims applies with equal force to coalition claims. First, coalition claims extend Section 2\u2019s protection to what are essentially political coalitions of distinct racial groups. See Midland I.S.D., 812 F.2d at 1504 (Higginbotham, J., dissenting) (explaining that minority coalitions are \u201calmost indistinguishable from political minorities as opposed to racial minorities\u201d). But Bartlett rejected the argument that Section 2 \u201cgrants special protection to a minority group\u2019s right to form political coalitions.\u201d 556 U.S. at 15, 129 S. Ct. at 1243. As an amicus brief states, \u201cBartlett thus rejected the argument that \u2018opportunity\u2019 under Section 2 includes the opportunity to form a majority with other voters\u2014whether those other voters are \u2018other racial minorities, whites, or both.\u2019\u201d See id. at 14, 129 S. Ct. at 1243. When, as here, a minority group cannot constitute a majority in a single-member district without combining with members of another minority group, Section 2 does not provide protection. \u201c[T]here neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.\u201d Growe, 507 U.S. at 41, 113 S. Ct. at 1084. In addition, coalition claims pose the same practical problems as crossover claims in determining the existence of the Gingles preconditions, especially whether the distinct minority groups are politically cohesive. One need _____________________ 9 Following Bartlett, the Court held in a Section 5 preclearance case that a threejudge district court \u201chad no basis\u201d for creating \u201ca minority coalition district\u201d if it intended to do so. Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 399, 132 S. Ct. 934, 944 (2012) (citing Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13\u201315, 129 S. Ct. at 1243\u201344). 23 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 24 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 only transpose Bartlett\u2019s language to indicate the problems as they apply to the claim in this case: What percentage of [black] voters supported [Hispanic]-preferred candidates in the past? How reliable would the [coalition] votes be in future elections? What types of candidates have [black] and [Hispanic] voters supported together in the past and will those trends continue? Were past [coalition] votes based on incumbency and did that depend on race? What are the historical turnout rates among [black] and [Hispanic] minority voters and will they stay the same? Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 17, 129 S. Ct. at 1245. Restricting Section 2\u2019s coverage to discrete minority groups obviates the need to confront these questions, which add judicially unmanageable complexity to the Gingles analysis. In fact, contemporary demographics suggest there is no stopping point if minority coalitions may be formed out of any minority racial or language groups. In Growe, for instance, the Supreme Court overturned (on other grounds) a remedial district that would have included blacks and \u201cthree separately identifiable minority groups.\u201d Growe, 507 U.S. at 38, 113 S. Ct. at 1083. The factual complexity of coalition claims only increases as the number of minority groups within the coalition increases. Accordingly, consistent with Bartlett, we reject Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to circumvent the majority-minority requirement by forming a political coalition composed of distinct racial groups. D. Other Observations Several other observations are not applicable to our statutory construction but are relevant in responding to the dissents and to Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. From an empirical standpoint, when litigated to judgment, coalition claims often fail, especially for lack of political cohesion, as in Growe, 507 24 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 25 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 U.S. at 41, 113 S. Ct. at 1085.10 This low success rate shows that the questions identified in the above discussion of Bartlett have indeed proven difficult to answer affirmatively. Perhaps that is because they are not meant to be answered in vote dilution lawsuits at all. See Clements, 999 F.2d at 897 (Jones, J., concurring) (arguing that the low success rate of coalition claims shows the \u201cutter bankruptcy\u201d of the coalition theory and the \u201cfactual complexity\u201d of claims premised on that theory). Plaintiffs attempt to frame the low success rate positively, as evidence that recognizing such claims carries limited real-world consequences. But coalition claims have significant practical consequences for both legislative bodies and the judiciary. As the Nixon court observed, legislators seeking in good faith to undertake redistricting will be uncertain how to consider more than one racial minority or language group. 76 F.3d at 1391. Should they aim for one \u201ccoalition\u201d district or two separate minority districts? How can their decisions avoid having considerations of race \u201cpredominate\u201d in legislative line-drawing? See, e.g., Cooper v. Harris, 581 U.S. 285, 292, 137 S. Ct. 1455, 1464 (2017); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 906\u201307, 116 S. Ct. 1894, 1901 (1996). Moreover, minority coalition suits, even if they fail, are extraordinarily costly and time-consuming for public entities to litigate. To avoid these costs, defendants will often settle or will take preemptive redistricting actions in anticipation of litigation, even though the actions might be legally unsound or unnecessary. The mere availability of the theory of action, then, has real impacts on voters of all races. _____________________ 10 Additional cases that rejected coalition claims on substantive grounds include Overton v. City of Austin, 871 F.2d 529 (5th Cir. 1989) (per curiam), and Brewer v. Ham, 876 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1989), from this court; and Hardee Cnty., 906 F.2d 524, Pope, 687 F.3d 565, Frank, 336 F.3d 570, and Badillo, 956 F.2d 884, from other circuit courts. 25 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 26 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Finally, federal courts are ill-suited to resolve minority coalition claims. No legal principle can explain the superiority of one redistricting choice over any other as applied to more than one racial or language minority, nor do Section 2 or Gingles speak to such choices. Hence, absent intentional discrimination or racial gerrymandering, courts are incapable of revisiting the legislative redistricting choices under the guise of assessing actionable vote dilution. Such choices are quintessentially political and, like questions raised by political gerrymandering, are not susceptible of judicial decisionmaking. Cf. Rucho v. Common Cause, 588 U.S. 684, 139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019). These problems exist only because Campos created minority coalition vote dilution claims. Despite these adverse consequences, Plaintiffs urge this court to continue the \u201ccurrent approach\u201d of allowing coalition claims when there is proof that the distinct minority groups are politically cohesive under the second Gingles precondition. The \u201ccurrent approach,\u201d however, is indefensible because it \u201cbegs the question of statutory construction altogether.\u201d See Clements, 999 F.2d at 895 (Jones, J., concurring). The statutory question is whether Section 2 allows distinct minority groups to aggregate their populations. For reasons identified above, the answer to that question is no, and Plaintiffs cannot prove the first Gingles precondition as a result. That they might be able to prove the second precondition is irrelevant. Second, by providing representation to a statutorily protected minority group despite its sub-majority numbers, coalition claims may \u201ccross the line from protecting minorities against racial discrimination to the prohibited . . . goal of mandating proportional representation.\u201d Id. at 896 (Jones, J., concurring); see also Allen v. Milligan, 599 U.S. 1, 28, 143 S. Ct. 1487, 1509 (2023) (\u201cForcing proportional representation is unlawful and inconsistent with this Court\u2019s approach to implementing \u00a7 2.\u201d). In this case, for instance, Galveston County\u2019s black community, comprising only 12.5 percent of the county\u2019s 26 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 27 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 citizen voting-age population, would not be able to elect a commissioner of its choice in the absence of a coalition. With the minority coalition, however, the black community is represented by one-fourth (25 percent) of the county commissioners. That exceeds proportional representation.11 Finally, the Voting Rights Act implemented the Fifteenth Amendment in order to create equality of access to the vote for black Americans. Section 2 extended the Act by adding, first, language minorities, and then the results test to remedy cases where distinct minorities had been excluded from effective group representation in legislative bodies. By any measure, the Act has accomplished its original purposes with great success. This en banc court\u2019s decision will in no way imperil such success. Our decision in Campos, however, extended Section 2 into racial and ethnic territory that extinguishes the line between a group\u2019s immutable individual characteristics, which may signal real political cohesiveness, and opportunistic political combinations. It was this aspect of coalition claims that Judge Higginbotham objected to most vehemently from the start. Midland I.S.D., 812 F.2d at 1504 (Higginbotham, J., dissenting). This court will not remain in the forefront of authorizing litigation, not compelled by law or the Supreme Court, whose principal effects are to (a) supplant legislative redistricting by elected representatives with judicial fiat; (b) encourage divisively counting citizens by race and ethnicity; and (c) displace the fundamental principle of democratic rule by the majority with balkanized interests. _____________________ 11 And despite their claims of political cohesion, the geographically dispersed Hispanic population has 22.5 percent of the county\u2019s voting age population, yet there is no elected Hispanic commissioner, and Hispanics are severely underrepresented compared with the black population in Precinct 3 under the proposed Map 1 (31 percent to 24 percent, respectively). 27 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 28 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 E. Stare Decisis Plaintiffs invoke stare decisis to support this court\u2019s existing precedent. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments do not apply any of the typical stare decisis factors12 but instead rely on two propositions: (1) that the operative precedent here has more weight because it was decided by this court en banc, and (2) that stare decisis is particularly strong when the underlying precedent interprets a statute. First, the contention that this court\u2019s en banc decision in LULAC v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831 (5th Cir. 1993), is the operative precedent is wrong. Judge Higginbotham, the most vocal opponent of aggregation at the time, wrote the Clements decision for the court, which disposed of the minority coalition\u2019s Section 2 claims on other grounds. The opinion applied this court\u2019s precedent authorizing coalition claims and expressly stated that it would not \u201crevisit\u201d the issue. Id. at 864. The concurrence argued that the court \u201cshould have\u201d addressed the coalition issue and should have held that Section 2 does not allow aggregation. Id. at 894 (Jones, J., concurring). Clements cannot, therefore, be said to have issued an en banc holding on coalition claims, and the Campos panel decision is the operative precedent. Second, statutory stare decisis is not a compelling barrier to overturning Campos. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cstare decisis carries enhanced force when a decision . . . interprets a statute.\u201d Kimble v. Marvel Ent., LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 456, 135 S. Ct. 2401, 2409 (2015). But the justification for applying this rule at the circuit court level is weak, at best. See Amy _____________________ 12 See Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 268, 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2265 (2022) (listing five factors for overturning precedential cases: \u201cthe nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the \u2018workability\u2019 of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance\u201d). 28 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 29 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Coney Barrett, Statutory Stare Decisis in the Courts of Appeals, 73 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 317, 318 (2005) (\u201cWhatever the merits of statutory stare decisis in the Supreme Court, the inferior courts have no sound basis for following the Supreme Court\u2019s practice.\u201d); see also Planned Parenthood v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 369 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (noting that our stare decisis \u201canalysis is not as exacting as that undertaken by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d). Plaintiffs cite no majority opinion of this court giving enhanced stare decisis effect to prior statutory interpretations. But see Smallwood v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 385 F.3d 568, 587 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (Smith, J., dissenting); Bhandari v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Com., 829 F.2d 1343, 1353 (5th Cir. 1987) (Higginbotham, J., concurring). \u201cNor has our en banc court hesitated to\u201d overturn erroneous statutory interpretations. United States v. Anderson, 885 F.2d 1248, 1255 (5th Cir. 1989) (en banc). Any hesitation is especially unwarranted here, given the existence of a circuit split on coalition claims. See id. at 1255 n.12 (\u201c[C]ongressional silence is not of great significance, given the split in the circuits . . . .\u201d). In the end, Campos\u2019s holding on aggregation is notable for its meager reasoning and for the magnitude of its error. Plaintiffs have offered no persuasive justification for this court to adhere to Campos. III. Conclusion Galveston County\u2019s democratically elected Commissioners Court enacted Map 2. The district court determined that this map was unlawful under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and required the commissioners court to adopt a new one with a minority-majority precinct for the county\u2019s black and Hispanic voters. Having reconsidered Campos, we hold that this decision was wrong. Section 2 does not require political subdivisions to draw precinct lines for the electoral benefit of distinct minority groups that share political preferences but lack the cementing force of race or ethnicity. 29 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 30 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir. 1988), and its progeny are OVERRULED. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court as to the Section 2 claim and REMAND for the district court to consider the intentional discrimination and racial gerrymandering claims brought by the Petteway Plaintiffs and the NAACP Plaintiffs.13 _____________________ 13 Pertinent considerations on remand will include: (1) the appropriate analytical framework to apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims (cf. Perez v. Abbott, 253 F. Supp. 3d 864, 942\u201343 (W.D. Tex. 2017)), and, in particular, (2) whether Plaintiffs can prove that they have been injured, or are entitled to relief, when their claims are premised on a coalition theory (cf. Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 232, 105 S. Ct. 1916, 1922 (1985) (requiring proof of both discriminatory impact and discriminatory effect)). We also observe that the Supreme Court recently rejected racial gerrymandering and vote dilution claims in Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, 144 S. Ct. 1221 (2024). The majority\u2019s opinion includes a helpful discussion on the relationship and distinctions between these claims. Id. at 1251\u201352. 30 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 31 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 James C. Ho, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment: I agree that the text of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and governing Supreme Court precedent foreclose vote dilution claims like the ones presented here. I write to briefly explain how I reach that conclusion. \u201c[T]hree members of the Supreme Court have suggested that courts should not decide vote dilution claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act at all.\u201d Harding v. County of Dallas, 948 F.3d 302, 316 (5th Cir. 2020) (Ho, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 946 (1994) (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), and Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 622 (2018) (Thomas, J., joined by Gorsuch, J., concurring)). That\u2019s why there was no majority opinion in Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1 (2009). A three-Justice plurality concluded that Section 2 does not require the creation of crossover districts. Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concurred only in the judgment, reiterating their longstanding view from Holder that Section 2 does not permit any vote dilution claim. Id. at 26. So a majority of the Justices agreed in Bartlett that, at a minimum, Section 2 does not require crossover districts. And the plurality\u2019s analysis also logically forecloses the coalition district theory presented here, as the en banc majority correctly explains. Accordingly, the en banc majority is right to overturn our circuit precedent in Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir. 1988). *** In Hamilton v. Dallas County, 79 F.4th 494 (5th Cir. 2023), the en banc court overturned our precedent to bring our circuit in line with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Today, the en banc court overturns our precedent to 31 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 32 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 bring our circuit in line with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In Hamilton, we concluded that our longstanding precedent construed Title VII too narrowly. Today, we conclude that our longstanding precedent construes Section 2 too broadly. But whether our precedent unduly narrowed or broadened the reach of a federal statute, our duty is the same. We reconcile our circuit precedent with the governing law, regardless of whose ox is gored. 32 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 33 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Haynes, Circuit Judge, dissenting: I respectfully dissent from the decision to overturn Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir. 1988). In my view, Campos properly concluded that \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act allows for a group of minority voters to aggregate their populations to bring a vote dilution claim as long as the minority coalition satisfies the Gingles14 preconditions. See 840 F.2d at 1244. The district court in this case found that the plaintiffs satisfied all the Gingles preconditions and met their burden to prove a \u00a7 2 violation. Because I cannot identify any reversible error of fact or law in the district court\u2019s reasoning, I would affirm on the same basis that the district court granted relief to the plaintiffs. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion\u2019s decision. _____________________ 14 Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986). 33 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 34 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Douglas, Circuit Judge, joined by Stewart, Graves, Higginson, and Ramirez, Circuit Judges, dissenting: Today, the majority finally dismantled the effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act in this circuit, leaving four decades of en banc precedent flattened in its wake.15 Because the majority reaches an atextual and ahistorical conclusion to overturn our own en banc precedent, I dissent. I I begin today by providing what the majority does not: context. First, I engage in a discussion of the history of the Voting Rights Act (\u201cVRA\u201d). Next, I discuss the development of the law surrounding minority coalition claims. Finally, I detail Galveston County\u2019s storied history of voting discrimination. Because the \u201cvery essence\u201d of a \u00a7 2 claim, as the United States Supreme Court has made clear, is that \u201csocial and historical conditions\u201d interact with the electoral process in such a way that the \u201c\u2018electoral structure operates to minimize or cancel out\u2019 minority voters\u2019 \u2018ability to elect their preferred candidates,\u2019\u201d Allen v. Milligan, 599 U.S. 1, 1718 (2023) (quoting Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 47-48 (1986)), we cannot, as the majority does, ignore these conditions as we engage in our analysis. A After the emancipation of enslaved peoples, Congress passed and the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment to enshrine in the United States Constitution the right to vote for all citizens, regardless of race. Despite the _____________________ 15 League of United Latin Am. Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 894 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc); Brewer v.

To remedy its failure, in 1965, Congress passed the VRA. Unlike the Fifteenth Amendment, the VRA had teeth, and it proved to be an extremely effective method of regulating discriminatory voting practices employed by the states throughout the 1900s. In the fifty years after the VRA\u2019s passage, Congress closely monitored its implementation and courts\u2019 interpretations. If the VRA failed to achieve its goals, and if the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation was misaligned with Congress\u2019 interpretation, Congress acted through the amendments process. 1 \u201cThe right to vote is the essence of a democratic society and \u2018preservative of all rights.\u2019\u201d Hopkins v. Watson, -- F.4th -- , 2024 WL 3448028, at *16 (5th Cir. July 18, 2024) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (quoting Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370, 6 S. Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886)). \u201cIt has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote, and to have their votes counted.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 554 (1964) (internal citations omitted). And \u201cit is \u2018as equally unquestionable that the right to have one\u2019s vote counted is as open to protection as the right to put a ballot in a box.\u2019\u201d Id. This is because \u201c[t]he right to vote freely for the candidate of one\u2019s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.\u201d Id. at 555. And, as the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cthe right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen\u2019s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.\u201d Id. Through the Fifteenth Amendment and the VRA, Congress attempted to address \u201cthe subtle, as well as the obvious, state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens their right to vote because of their race.\u201d Allen v. State Bd. of Elecs., 393 U.S. 544, 566 (1969). 35 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 36 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Ratified in 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. XV, \u00a7 1. Though \u201cthe immediate concern of the Amendment was to guarantee to the emancipated slaves the right to vote, . . . the Amendment goes beyond it.\u201d Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 512 (2000). Indeed, in granting protection to all persons, not just members of a particular race, the Amendment was designed \u201cto reaffirm the equality of races at the most basic level\u201d\u2014the right to vote. Id. The Supreme Court has eloquently spoken on the importance of the Fifteenth Amendment: \u201cA resolve so absolute required language as simple in command as it was comprehensive in reach. Fundamental in purpose and effect and selfexecuting in operation, the Amendment prohibits all provisions denying or abridging the voting franchise of any citizen or class of citizens on the basis of race.\u201d Id. However, \u201c[t]hough the commitment was clear, the reality remained far from the promise.\u201d Id. at 513; see also Allen, 599 U.S. at 10 (\u201cIn the century that followed, however, the [Fifteenth] Amendment proved little more than a parchment promise.\u201d). \u201cManipulative devices and practices were soon employed\u201d to disenfranchise voters of color. Rice, 528 U.S. at 513 (collecting references to manipulative devices, including grandfather clauses, procedural hurdles, White primaries, registration challenges, racial gerrymandering, and interpretation tests). These devices essentially \u201crender[ed] the right to vote illusory.\u201d Allen, 599 U.S. at 10. The problems that the Fifteenth Amendment attempted to solve were not unique to Black Americans. After the Civil War, segregation and Jim Crow laws plagued Black and Latino citizens alike. Unfortunately, and as the Supreme Court has recently recognized, \u201cCongress stood up to little of it; \u2018the first century of congressional enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment 36 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 37 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 can only be regarded as a failure.\u2019\u201d Allen, 599 U.S. at 10 (alteration in original) (quoting Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 197 (2009)). To remedy the \u201cfailure\u201d of the Fifteenth Amendment, and spurred by the Civil Rights movement, Congress enacted the VRA in 1965. Voting Rights Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-110, 79 Stat. 445 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1971, 1973 to 1973bb-1). The VRA was enacted by Congress as a means of \u201c\u2018attack[ing] the blight of voting discrimination\u2019 across the Nation.\u201d Reno v. Bossier Par. Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 476 (1997); see also Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 403 (1991) (\u201cCongress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for the broad remedial purpose of \u2018rid[ding] the country of racial discrimination in voting.\u2019\u201d). In enacting the VRA, \u201cthe voluminous legislative history of the Act\u201d illuminates two points. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 309 (1966). \u201cFirst: Congress felt itself confronted by an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.\u201d Id. And second: \u201cCongress concluded that the unsuccessful remedies which it had prescribed in the past would have to be replaced by sterner and more elaborate measures in order to satisfy the clear commands of the Fifteenth Amendment.\u201d Id. As such, the Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cthe Act should be interpreted in a manner that provides \u2018the broadest possible scope\u2019 in combating racial discrimination.\u201d Chisom, 501 U.S. at 403 (quoting Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 567 (1969)). In particular, \u00a7 2 of the VRA \u201cwas designed as a means of eradicating voting practices that \u2018minimize or cancel out the voting strength and political effectiveness of minority groups.\u2019\u201d Reno, 520 U.S. at 479 (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 4 (1982)). As initially enacted, \u201c\u00a7 2 closely tracked the language of the Amendment it was adopted to enforce.\u201d Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l Comm., 594 U.S. 647, 656 (2021). Accordingly, \u00a7 2 simply 37 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 38 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 read: \u201cNo voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d Voting Rights Act \u00a7 2 (1965). Because of its many enforcement mechanisms, the VRA was able to do what the Fifteenth Amendment could not\u2014indeed, \u201cin only sixteen years\u2019 time, many considered the VRA \u2018the most successful civil rights statute in the history of the Nation.\u2019\u201d Allen, 599 U.S. at 10 (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 111 (1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177). Over the next fifty years, Congress substantively amended the VRA four times. 2 In 1975, Congress amended \u00a7 2 to include a prohibition against discrimination on the basis of language. Chisom, 501 U.S. at 392. Congress recognized a need to explicitly extend the protections of \u00a7 2 to other groups that suffered from voting discrimination. Congress recognized that, like Black voters, \u201c[l]anguage minority citizens . . . must overcome the effects of discrimination as well as efforts to minimize the impact of their political participation.\u201d S. Rep. No. 94-295, at 25, 28\u201329 (1975), as reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 774, 791. That was particularly so in states like Texas, which Congress recognized had a \u201clong history of discriminating against members of [Black and Latino communities] in ways similar to the myriad forms of discrimination practiced against [Black voters] in the South.\u201d Id. at 25, 2829. Also in its 1975 amendments, Congress made clear that where it intended a single group requirement, it was capable of expressly saying so. The amendments prescribed that states and political subdivisions must provide voting materials, including ballots, in non-English languages if a language minority makes up more than five percent of the citizens of voting 38 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 39 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 age. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973aa-1b (codified as amended at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10303(f)(3)). The language of the 1975 Amendments specifically stated that the five percent must be made of \u201cmembers of a single language minority.\u201d Id. (emphasis added); cf. Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.S. 351, 358 (2014) (\u201cWhen \u2018Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another\u2019 . . . this Court \u2018presumes\u2019 that Congress intended a difference in meaning.\u201d) (alteration in original). Moreover, the Senate Report to the 1975 Amendments reveals that Congress explicitly relied on cases involving minority coalition claims as part of the amendment process, signaling its knowledge of courts\u2019 practices of accepting minority coalition suits. Congress relied on Coalition for Education in District One v. Board of Elections of the City of New York, 495 F.2d 1090, 1091 (2d Cir. 1974) (\u201cCEDO\u201d). In that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a district court\u2019s finding that a school board election was invalid. Id. The plaintiffs\u2014a group of Black, Hispanic, and Chinese voters\u2014challenged the validity of the school board election under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the VRA. Id. The district court held, after a bench trial, that various acts of the Board of Elections had a discriminatory impact on the rights of minority voters that could have affected several hundred votes cast in the election. Id. As a result, the district court ordered a new election take place. Id. The Second Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1094. 3 In 1982, Congress amended \u00a7 2 of the VRA yet again, resulting, substantively, in today\u2019s version of the statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973 (1982) (codified as amended in 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301). In large part, the 1982 Amendments were motivated by a series of decisions by the Supreme Court holding that discriminatory intent, rather than discriminatory impact, was 39 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 40 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 required under \u00a7 2 of the VRA. S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 15-16 (1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 192-93; see, e.g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976) (holding, for the first time, that discriminatory intent was required to successfully state a claim under \u00a7 2); see also Veasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 241 n.31 (5th Cir. 2016) (\u201cCongress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982 to make it clear that plaintiffs could sue for discriminatory impact after Supreme Court precedent had required the showing of a discriminatory purpose under Section 2.\u201d). Also in the 1982 Amendments was the addition of the language at issue in this case: the reference to a class of citizens in the singular. Section 2, in its modern form, substantively adopted in 1982, reads as follows: (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 10303(f)(2) of this title, as provided in subsection (b). (b) A violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population. 40 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 41 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301 (formerly cited as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973) (emphasis added). In crafting those amendments, Congress again relied on several minority coalition suits like United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 150 n.5 (1977). S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 173. In Carey, the Supreme Court noted, and did not question, that \u201cthe court below classified Puerto Ricans in New York with blacks as a minority group entitled to the protections of the Voting Rights Act.\u201d Carey, 430 U.S. at 150 n.5. Congress also relied on Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 60 (1964), wherein the Supreme Court dismissed a minority coalition suit brought pursuant to the Fifteenth Amendment on other grounds, indicating tacit acceptance. S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 132. Though Wright pre-dated the VRA, the connection between the Fifteenth Amendment and the VRA indicates the Court\u2019s intent to condone minority coalition suits early on. See also id. at 10-11, 26 (favorably citing Jones v. City of Lubbock, 640 F.2d 777 (5th Cir. 1981), a Fifth Circuit case involving a coalition of Black and Latino voters). 4 Congress again amended the VRA in 1992. The 1992 Amendments stemmed from \u201cthe continuing need for language assistance in voting.\u201d S. Rep. No. 102-315, at 3 (1992). Congress affirmed that \u201clanguage minority citizens had been effectively excluded from participation in the electoral process\u201d and stated that \u201cthe denial of the right to vote of such minority group citizens is ordinarily directly related to the unequal educational opportunities afforded them, resulting in high illiteracy and low voting participation.\u201d Id. at 4. To address this need, Congress took three actions: Congress (1) extended the bilingual election requirements to remain in place through 2007; (2) provided additional coverage to Native Americans residing on reservations; and (3) extended \u201cthe coverage of the language assistance 41 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 42 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 provisions to counties with more than 10,000 voting-age language minority citizens who otherwise qualify for language assistance.\u201d Id. at 2. Not all language minority groups are afforded protection. Congress affirmed in the 1992 Amendments that the four language minority groups covered by the VRA are \u201cHispanics, Asian Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives.\u201d Id. at 4. However, Congress explicitly recognized that these groups are not homogenous and themselves account for a wide array of languages. See id. at 27. For example, the 1992 Senate Report consistently refers to languages (plural) when discussing lack of access to voting information for Native Americans. See, e.g., id. at 9 (\u201cLack of access to absentee voting information to Native Americans in their native languages is further documented by their experience in the 1984 general election.\u201d); id. (\u201cIn another example, election officials provided little or no information in Native American languages regarding the process for purging names from their jurisdictions\u2019 voter registration lists.\u201d); id. at 14 (discussing costs and noting that \u201c[i]n the case of traditionally unwritten languages, such as most Native American languages, only oral assistance is required\u201d). Likewise, the 1992 Senate Report specifically discusses the fact that the \u201cAsian American\u201d category encompasses, inter alia, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Japanese voters. Id. at 12. 5 Congress most recently amended the VRA in 2006. These Amendments largely addressed the now unconstitutional \u00a7 5 (preclearance), rather than \u00a7 2. However, it is the amendment process that is important in this instance. Congress amended \u00a7 5 so it would closely track the language of \u00a7 2. The 2006 Amendments added \u00a7 5(b), which reads: 42 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 43 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting that has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 10303(f)(2) of this title, to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10304(b). In comparison, \u00a7 2(a) reads: \u201cNo voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d Id. \u00a7 10301(a). In adopting \u00a7 5(b), which contained nearly the same language as in \u00a7 2(a), Congress stated \u201c[v]oting changes that leave a minority group less able to elect a preferred candidate of choice, either directly or when coalesced with other voters, cannot be precleared under Section 5.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 109478, at 71 (2006) (emphasis added). Congress also identified: \u201cNaturally occurring majority-minority districts have long been the historical focus of the Voting Rights Act. They are the districts that would be created if legitimate, neutral principles of drawing district boundaries . . . were combined with the existence of a large and compact minority population to draw a district in which racial minorities form a majority.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109295, at 21 (2006) (emphasis added). B From its earliest interpretation of the VRA, the Supreme Court recognized that its protections were\u2014and should be\u2014broadly interpreted. Chisom, 501 U.S. at 403 (\u201c[The VRA] should be interpreted in a manner that provides \u2018the broadest possible scope\u2019 in combating racial discrimination.\u201d); 43 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 44 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 see also Johnson v. DeGrandy, 512 U.S. 997 (1994) (noting the VRA is \u201ca statute meant to hasten the waning of racism in American politics\u201d). Consistent with this mandate, the Court has consistently permitted minority coalition claims. Carey, 400 U.S. at 150 n.5; Wright, 376 U.S. at 60. The circuit courts followed suit\u2014including our own. In 1986, the Supreme Court clarified the requirements of a \u00a7 2 vote dilution claim after the 1982 Amendments in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30. In Gingles, the Supreme Court outlined the following three preconditions that a minority-group-plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) \u201cthat it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district\u201d; (2) \u201cthat it is politically cohesive\u201d; and (3) \u201cthat the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d Id. at 50-51. Next, plaintiffs must show that, under the totality of the circumstances, the political process is not \u201cequally open\u201d to them. The question of whether political processes are \u201cequally open\u201d depends upon a \u201cpractical evaluation of the \u2018past and present reality.\u2019\u201d Id. at 75. As such, \u201cproof that some minority candidates have been elected does not foreclose a \u00a7 2 claim.\u201d Id. Recently, in Allen v. Milligan, the Supreme Court gave further context to the purpose of each Gingles precondition: Each Gingles precondition serves a different purpose. The first, focused on geographical compactness and numerosity, is \u201cneeded to establish that the minority has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice in some single-member district.\u201d The second, concerning the political cohesiveness of the minority group, shows that a representative of its choice would in fact be elected. The third precondition, focused on racially polarized voting, \u201cestablishes that the challenged districting thwarts a distinctive minority vote\u201d at least plausibly on account of race. And finally, the totality of the 44 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 45 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 circumstances inquiry recognizes that application of the Gingles factors is \u201cpeculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case.\u201d Before courts can find a violation of \u00a7 2, therefore, they must conduct \u201can intensely local appraisal\u201d of the electoral mechanism at issue, as well as a \u201csearching practical evaluation of the \u2018past and present reality.\u2019\u201d Allen, 599 U.S. at 18-19. The Allen Court also reaffirmed the Gingles test: Gingles has governed our Voting Rights Act jurisprudence since it was decided 37 years ago. Congress has never disturbed our understanding of \u00a7 2 as Gingles construed it. And we have applied Gingles in one \u00a7 2 case after another, to different kinds of electoral system and to different jurisdictions in States all over the country.\u201d). The Gingles test thus serves as the bedrock requirement charging courts with the responsibility to stop racial vote suppression through gerrymandering. Moreover, the Gingles test has provided lower courts with the practical tools to evaluate minority coalition claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 2. We were in fact the first circuit to specifically consider the efficacy of minority coalition claims. In 1987, we correctly decided League of United Latin American Citizens Council No. 4386 v. Midland Independent School District, wherein we held that a coalition of Black and Mexican Americans had satisfied the Gingles factors in demonstrating that an at-large school board election diluted their votes. 812 F.2d 1494. Neither the district court, nor this court, took issue with the minority coalition as a basis for \u00a7 2. See id. at 1495 (\u201cBlacks and Mexican-Americans in Midland, Texas, join hands in this class action to prevent their votes being diluted by an at-large system of voting in the election of trustees to the Board of Trustees for the Midland Independent School District.\u201d). Ultimately, the en banc court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment on other grounds. League of United Latin Am. Citizens Council No. 4386 v. Midland Indep. Sch. Dist., 829 F.2d 546, 548 (5th 45 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 46 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Cir. 1987) (Wisdom, J., and Rubin, J., specifically concurring) (concurring in result and reaffirming their views stated in the panel opinion). One year later, in Campos v. City of Baytown, we made our Midland holding explicit. In Campos, we affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that vote dilution of Black and Mexican American voters had occurred. Campos, 840 F.2d at 1250. In doing so, we held \u201c[t]here is nothing in the law that prevents the plaintiffs from identifying the protected aggrieved minority to include both Blacks and Hispanics.\u201d Id. at 1244. We reasoned: Congress itself recognized \u201cthat voting discrimination against citizens of language minorities is pervasive and national in scope,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(f)(1), and similar discrimination against Blacks is well documented. If, together, they are of such numbers residing geographically so as to constitute a majority in a single member district, they cross the Gingles threshold as potentially disadvantaged voters. Id. We also clearly articulated the limiting principle that remains in effect today and prevents a windfall for minority coalitions: Plaintiffs must still prove \u201cthat the minorities so identified actually vote together and are impeded in their ability to elect their own candidates by all of the circumstances, including especially the bloc voting of a white majority that usually defeats the candidate of the minority.\u201d Id. (stating that \u201ca minority group is politically cohesive if it votes together\u201d); see also Brewer, 876 F.2d at 454 (\u201c[C]ourts should not hastily assume that cooperation among minority groups in filing a Section 2 complaint will inevitably lead to a finding of political cohesion in their actual electoral practices. While appellants correctly note that statistical evidence is not a sine qua non to establishing cohesion, they must still satisfy their burden of proof under Section 2 and Thornburg.\u201d). 46 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 47 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 We then affirmed that holding several times over the next decade. See id. at 453-54 (reiterating that minority coalitions may be used to satisfy \u00a7 2); Overton, 871 F.2d 529 (implicitly recognizing the validity of a minority coalition claim). In 1993, we affirmed our Campos holding on this very issue en banc in League of United Latin Am. Citizens, Council 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d at 864 (affirming our Campos decision and holding that \u201c[i]f blacks and Hispanics vote cohesively, they are legally a single minority group\u201d under \u00a7 2).

Kent County, the Sixth Circuit, met with hefty dissent, rejected the validity of minority coalition suits, finding they were not \u201cpart of Congress\u2019 remedial purpose\u201d in enacting the VRA. 76 F.3d 1381, 1393 (6th Cir. 1996). The Sixth Circuit began with its reading of the text of \u00a7 2. It reasoned that because \u00a7 2 speaks in the singular, using terms such as \u201ca class\u201d or \u201cits members,\u201d an analysis of the text of \u00a7 2 \u201creveals no word or phrase which reasonably supports combining separately protected minorities.\u201d Id. at 1386-87. In reaching this conclusion, the Sixth Circuit relied heavily on dissents from members of this court. Id. at 1384 (citing Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissents in Campos, 849 F.2d at 945, and Midland, 812 F.2d at 1503, and Judge Jones\u2019 concurrence in Clements, 999 F.2d at 894). Until today, the Sixth Circuit was an outlier. All other circuits that have considered the issue ruled that minority coalition suits may be used to satisfy \u00a7 2. See Pope v. Cnty. of Albany, 687 F.3d 565 (2d Cir. 2012); Badillo v. City of Stockton, 956 F.2d 884 (9th Cir. 1992); Concerned Citizens v. Hardee Cnty.

With history in hand, we turn to the facts of this case. C Texas has historically discriminated against both Black and Latino voters. And Galveston County is, by all accounts, the embodiment of the conditions which led to \u00a7 2\u2019s adoption. Because \u201ca page of history is worth a 48 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 49 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 volume of logic,\u201d New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349 (1921), I detail Galveston County\u2019s storied history below. The early history of Galveston County was characterized by its role as an epicenter of the nation\u2019s slave trade. In the nineteenth century, Galveston held the largest slave auction house west of the Mississippi River, where its mayor was an active participant.17 Galveston\u2019s slave trade continued even after the Civil War.18 In 1865, Galveston County\u2019s enslaved population gave birth to the now federally recognized Juneteenth celebration, a holiday that has been recognized by the Texas Legislature since the 1970s.19 Juneteenth is now widely known as the day that enslaved people in Texas were finally freed.20 Of course, the Juneteenth order did not, as a legal matter, emancipate individuals from slavery.21 That was accomplished via President Lincoln\u2019s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation of 1862 and final proclamation of 1863.22 But these proclamations were largely ignored or subverted.23 If the 1800s were characterized by the slave trade, the 1900s were characterized by a new brand of racism\u2014voter suppression. In the post-Civil War era, \u201crace relations in the county reflected those seen across much of _____________________ 17 John Burnett, The New Juneteenth Holiday Traces Its Roots to Galveston, Texas, NPR (June 20, 2022, 5:00 AM), https://www.npr.org/2022/06/20/1105911785/the-newjuneteenth-federal-holiday-traces-its-roots-to-galvestontexas#:~:text=The%20city%2C%20which%20was%20the,the%20city's%20major%20slave%2 0dealer; Brett J.

In 1902, the Texas Legislature imposed a poll tax on its voters.24 And in 1923, Texas enacted the Statute of Texas, which allowed only White voters to participate in the Democratic primary election. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536, 540 (1927). The Statute of Texas made its way to the Supreme Court in 1927. In Nixon v. Herndon, a unanimous Supreme Court struck down the law as unconstitutional, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 540-41. The Court spoke with forcefulness: The important question is whether the statute can be sustained. But although we state it as a question the answer does not seem to us open to a doubt. We find it unnecessary to consider the Fifteenth Amendment, because it seems to us hard to imagine a more direct and obvious infringement of the Fourteenth. Id. The Supreme Court thus upheld the right to vote in Texas primary elections for all. Id. at 541. After Herndon, the Texas Legislature promptly enacted a new statute, giving the State Executive Committee of a party the power to prescribe voting qualifications for its members. Nixon v. Condon, 286 U.S. 73, 81-82 (1932). And acting under the new statute, the State Executive Committee of the _____________________ 24 The state of Texas has resorted to the imposition of a poll tax many times throughout history.

However, it was not until 1902 that the poll tax became a prerequisite for one\u2019s eligibility to vote. Id. 50 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 51 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Democratic party adopted a White-only primary election requirement for the 1928 election. Id. at 82. After being refused the right to vote again under the party\u2019s rule, the Herndon plaintiff sued. Id. at 83. The Supreme Court again invalidated the Texas statute, finding that the Committee members are representatives of the state, the members\u2019 action was State action, and thus that action was constrained by the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 89. The saga of Texas\u2019 White-only primary did not end there. The Supreme Court had to, again, address the issue in 1944 in Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944). Only twenty-two days after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Condon, the Texas Democratic party, in a state convention, adopted its own White-only primary requirement. Id. at 656-57. After being denied the ability to vote in the Texas Democratic primary election of 1940 because of this rule, Lonnie E. Smith, a Black citizen of Harris County, Texas, sued. Id. at 650-51. In Smith, the Supreme Court recounted the collective impact of its jurisprudence in, inter alia, Herndon and Condon: \u201cIt may now be taken as a postulate that the right to vote in such a primary for the nomination of candidates without discrimination by the State, like the right to vote in a general election, is a right secured by the Constitution.\u201d Id. at 661-62. The Court further examined whether the party\u2019s action in Smith violated that right. Id. at 663-64. The Supreme Court concluded that it did. Id. at 664. The Court found that Texas\u2019 specific statutory system made the party \u201can agency of the state in so far as it determines the participants in a primary election.\u201d Id. at 663. The Court concluded that the right to vote \u201cis not to be nul[l]ified by a state through casting its electoral process in a form which permits a private organization to practice racial discrimination in the election. Constitutional rights would be of little value if they could be thus indirectly denied.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Smith was the 51 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 52 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 culmination of a decades-long, and ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to maintain White-only primary elections in Texas. In modern history, Galveston County has resisted the Black and Latino vote at every turn. From 1975 to 2013, the years where Galveston County was subject to \u00a7 5 preclearance,25 the County\u2019s redistricting process required Attorney General intervention on six occasions. One such occasion requiring federal intervention was in 2012. In the 2012 redistricting process, the Galveston County majority hired map-makers and business partners Thomas Hofeller and Dale Oldham. Nicknamed \u201cthe Michelangelo of the modern gerrymander,\u201d26 Hofeller was behind a 1980s strategy to increase Republican power in the South through the 1965 VRA.27 By creating more majority-Black districts, the strategy sought to concentrate minority voting power into fewer districts, with the goal of making it easier for Republican candidates to win the remaining majority-White districts.28 Hofeller infamously stated: \u201cRedistricting is like an election in reverse! It\u2019s a great event. . . . Usually the voters get to pick the politicians. In redistricting, _____________________ 25 Section 5 of the VRA \u201cprovided that no change in voting procedures could take effect until it was approved by federal authorities in Washington, D.C.\u2014either the Attorney General or a court of three judges.\u201d Id. at 537. \u201cA jurisdiction could obtain such \u2018preclearance\u2019 only by proving that the change had neither \u2018the purpose nor the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\u2019\u201d Id. Prior to Shelby County, Galveston County was subject to the preclearance process, and it frequently required federal intervention. 26 Michael Wines, Thomas Hofeller, Republican Master of Political Maps, Dies at 75, The New York Times, (Aug. 21, 2018) https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/obituaries/thomas-hofeller-republican-masterof-political-maps-dies-at-75.html. 27 Id. 28 Id. 52 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 53 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 the politicians get to pick the voters;\u201d he also called the redistricting process \u201cthe only legalized form of vote-stealing left in the United States today.\u201d29 As confirmed by the district court in its extensive fact-finding after an exhaustive trial, when the 2021 redistricting process came around, the County, no longer constrained by \u00a7 5\u2019s preclearance, set to work to rid itself of its majority-minority district. Galveston County\u2019s governing body is called the \u201cGalveston County Commissioners Court.\u201d The Commissioners court is made up of a county judge elected at-large as the presiding officer and four county commissioners elected from single-member precincts. In 2021, Judge Mark Henry was the county judge and had been since 2010. The four commissioners were Darrell Apffel (Precinct 1), Joe Giusti (Precinct 2), Stephen Holmes (Precinct 3), and Ken Clark (Precinct 4). The majority leaders of Galveston County (consisting of Judge Henry and Commissioners Apffel, Giusti, and Clark) again hired Dale Oldham. Commissioner Holmes voted against his hiring. \u201cShortly after engaging Oldham, Judge Henry and the county\u2019s general counsel, Paul Ready, contacted Oldham to ask whether the county \u2018had to draw a majorityminority district,\u2019\u201d to which Oldham replied that the answer depended on the census data. The map ultimately proposed was \u201c\u2018the visualization of the instructions\u2019 Judge Henry provided Oldham,\u201d\u2014a map that resulted in no majority-minority districts in Galveston County. Though the County suggested the goal in redistricting was to create a coastal precinct, \u201cOldham admitted that it was possible to retain a majority-minority precinct while also creating a coastal precinct.\u201d _____________________ 29 Miles Parks, Redistricting Guru\u2019s Hard Drives Could Mean Legal, Political Woes for GOP, NPR, (June 6, 2019, 7:14 PM) https://www.npr.org/2019/06/06/730260511/redistricting-gurus-hard-drives-couldmean-legal-political-woes-for-gop. 53 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 54 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Appellees sued under the VRA\u2019s \u00a7 2, alleging Galveston County\u2019s new maps impermissibly diluted their voting power. After a ten-day bench trial, the district court found Appellants\u2019 actions \u201cfundamentally inconsistent with [\u00a7] 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\u201d It found Appellants\u2019 redistricting to be \u201cegregious,\u201d \u201ca textbook example of a racial gerrymander.\u201d The district court\u2019s 157-page Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law details just how egregious Galveston County\u2019s \u00a7 2 violation was. First, the district court held that the County\u2019s Black and Latino communities were both sufficiently large and geographically compact to satisfy that Gingles precondition. The district court cited Clements for the proposition that \u201c[t]he cohesiveness of minority coalitions is \u2018treated as a question of fact, allowing aggregation of different minority groups where the evidence suggests that they are politically cohesive.\u201d The district court then found that the plaintiffs\u2019 illustrative plans demonstrated that the Black and Latino population in Galveston County is compact enough to form a majority of eligible voters in a reasonably configured precinct. Next, the district court considered the second Gingles precondition\u2014 whether the plaintiffs are \u201cpolitically cohesive.\u201d Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51; It found that \u201c[t]he undisputed evidence shows that the combined Black and Latino coalition is highly cohesive.\u201d Indeed, it found that \u201cover 75% of Black and Latino voters have voted for the same candidates in numerous elections.\u201d Accordingly, the district court concluded that \u201cthe county\u2019s Black and Latino populations act as a coalition and are politically cohesive.\u201d The district court then evaluated the final Gingles precondition\u2014 whether \u201cthe white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51; The district court found that this condition was met. It is undisputed that certain 54 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 55 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 statistical evidence showed that \u201cmore than 85% of Anglos vote cohesively for candidates running in opposition to those supported by more than 85% of Black and Latino voters.\u201d The district court also credited the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that \u201cthe degree of Anglo bloc voting is sufficient to defeat a minority-preferred candidate in each commissioner precinct in the enacted plan.\u201d The district court also found that the minority vote is thwarted \u201cat least plausibly on account of race.\u201d And the County failed to present evidence sufficient to dispute this finding.30 Accordingly, the district court found that each of the Gingles preconditions are met. Finally, the district court evaluated, under the totality of the circumstances, whether the political process is \u201cequally open\u201d to the plaintiffs, a question that depends upon a \u201cpractical evaluation of the \u2018past and present reality.\u2019\u201d Gingles, 478 U.S. at 75. The district court spoke at length about the factors weighing in favor of a finding that \u00a7 2 had been violated. Worth noting, the district court considered proportionality. It clarified that \u201cit is the status of the candidate as the chosen representative of a particular racial group, not the race of the candidate that is important.\u201d Thus, it is irrelevant to the analysis that one of the commissioners is Black, because, as the district court found, \u201c[h]is precinct is predominantly Anglo and several witnesses . . . testified that he would not be the candidate of choice of Black and Latino voters.\u201d The district court also considered whether the voices of Black and Latino voters were \u201cshut out of the process altogether.\u201d Looking at the totality of the circumstances, the district court found that it was \u201cstunning _____________________ 30 Of Appellants\u2019 coastal precinct argument, the district court determined that \u201ca desire to create a coastal precinct cannot and does not explain or justify why [the map] . . . was drawn the way it was\u2014and especially does not explain its obliteration of benchmark Precinct 3.\u201d 55 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 56 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 how completely the county extinguished the Black and Latino communities\u2019 voice on its commissioners court during the 2021\u2019s redistricting.\u201d The district court stated the following: Galveston County was created in 1838. From its founding, it would be 133 years before a Latino, Frank Carmona, was elected to commissioners court. And it would be 150 years before a Black, Wayne Johnson, won a seat. Commissioner Johnson\u2019s district, old Precinct 3, would continue to elect the minority community\u2019s candidate of choice right up until 2021, when Precinct 3 was summarily carved up and wiped off the map. Blacks\u2019 and Latinos\u2019 commissioner of choice was always a lonely voice on the court, but that commissioner\u2019s presence\u2014whether it was Wayne Johnson or Stephen Holmes\u2014meant that \u201cminority voices [were] heard in a meaningful way.\u201d Id. The result of 2021\u2019s redistricting, however, has amounted to Black and Latino voters, as a coalition of like-minded citizens with shared concerns, \u201cbeing shut out of the process altogether.\u201d Id. This is not a typical redistricting case. What happened here was stark and jarring. The commissioners court transformed Precinct 3 from the precinct with the highest percentage of Black and Latino residents to that with the lowest percentage. The circumstances and effect of the enacted plan were \u201cmeanspirited\u201d and \u201cegregious\u201d given that \u201cthere was absolutely no reason to make major changes to Precinct 3.\u201d In conclusion, the district court aptly noted that \u201calthough Galveston County is no longer subject to preclearance, the [Appellants] still must comply with the edicts of[\u00a7] 2.\u201d But Galveston County\u2019s redistricting process amounted to \u201ca clear violation of \u00a7 2.\u201d I agree. And for the last several decades, so did our precedent. But today, the majority discards that well-established authority. 56 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 57 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Now armed with the factual and historical context the majority opinion ignores, we turn to the merits. II In my view, this case is a simple one, not only because traditional methods of statutory interpretation compel only one outcome, but critically because Appellants fail to carry their burden of persuasion as to why this court should overturn its precedent articulated in Clements, 999 F.2d at 864. Luckily for Appellants, the majority relieves them of this burden.31 A The majority contends that we do not have to reckon with the doctrine of stare decisis because we are merely overturning a panel opinion, which holds no precedential weight for the en banc court.32 I first clarify that we are, indeed, overturning en banc precedent today. Next, I summarize why there is no grounds to do so. According to the majority, Clements is not the operative precedent because the Clements decision \u201cdisposed of the minority coalition\u2019s Section 2 claims on other grounds.\u201d Thus, the majority claims, because the Clements decision \u201capplied this court\u2019s precedent authorizing coalition claims and expressly stated that it would not \u2018revisit\u2019 the issue,\u201d \u201cClements cannot . . . be said to have issued an en banc holding on coalition claims,\u201d and the Campos panel decision is the operative precedent. That is blatantly incorrect. _____________________ 31 Indeed, the majority has long signaled its belief that the en banc court should \u201clay to rest the minority coalition theory of vote dilution claims.\u201d Clements, 999 F.2d at 894 & n. 2 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (Jones, J., concurring). 32 To be clear, even when overruling only a panel decision, though the stare decisis analysis is \u201cnot as exacting,\u201d \u201c[t]hat does not mean that principles underpinning the doctrine of stare decisis have no place in the en banc court\u2019s decision.\u201d Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. Health Servs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 369 (5th Cir. 2020) 57 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 58 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 In Clements, the majority recognized that \u201cwhether different racial or ethnic minority groups . . . may combine to form a single minority group within the meaning of the Voting Rights Act\u201d had raised questions. Clements, 999 F.2d at 863-64. However, the majority went on to conclude that \u201cwe have treated the issue as a question of fact, allowing aggregation of different minority groups where the evidence suggests that they are political cohesive,\u201d and the majority refused to revisit that settled question again. Id. at 864 (citing our decision in Midland). To say that the court in Clements disposed of the coalition claims on other grounds and thus did not issue an en banc holding on this issue is incorrect. Had a majority of the en banc court, in 1993, wished to reverse the panel\u2019s decision in Midland, it could have done so. But the Clements court did not do that. Therefore, contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, today, this court has overturned four decades of en banc precedent without any consideration of whether such a diversion from stare decisis is appropriate. Now, Appellants must face the hurdle of overturning our en banc precedent head-on. Appellants cannot clear that hurdle. We are a \u201cstrict stare decisis court.\u201d Ballew v. Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc., 668 F.3d 777, 782 (5th Cir. 2012). And pursuant to the doctrine of stare decisis, \u201c[s]etting aside any precedent requires a \u2018special justification\u2019 beyond a bare belief that it was wrong.\u201d Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 413 (2010).33 Here, Appellants have the _____________________ 33 The majority\u2019s citation to Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Family Planning and Preventative Health Services, Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 369 (5th Cir. 2020), for the proposition that our stare decisis analysis is less exacting than that of the Supreme Court is misguided in the context of this case. In Kauffman, the en banc court was overturning a panel opinion, not another en banc decision. Id. (\u201cThat does not mean that principles underpinning the doctrine of stare decisis have no place in the en banc court\u2019s decision about whether to overturn or abrogate a panel\u2019s prior decision. But the analysis is not as exacting as that undertaken by the Supreme Court of the United States in applying the stare 58 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 59 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 burden of demonstrating why we should overturn our en banc precedent.34 But they have come far short of doing so: Appellants did not cite the stare decisis factors, nor did they meaningfully engage in a discussion about stare decisis at all; in all their briefs, stare decisis was mentioned only once.35 B Nor is there intervening Supreme Court precedent that casts doubt on the efficacy of coalition claims. The majority relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1 (2009), for the proposition that \u201cdecisions of the Supreme Court over the past two decades have undermined the validity of minority-coalition claims,\u201d justifying our revisiting this issue. However, Bartlett provides no such support. In Bartlett, the Supreme Court held that crossover districts\u2014districts where \u201cminority voters make up less than a majority of the voting-age population,\u201d but where \u201cthe minority population, at least potentially, is large enough to elect the candidate of its choice with help from voters who are members of the majority and who cross over to support the minority\u2019s preferred candidate\u201d\u2014cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of a vote _____________________ decisis doctrine, as it must, in deciding whether to overturn its own precedent.\u201d) (emphasis added). But when an en banc court sits to overturn en banc precedent, the situation is much more akin to that of the Supreme Court, where decisions are made by the whole court, rather than \u201cthe majority vote of just three circuit judges.\u201d Chambers v. Dist. of Columbia, 35 F.4th 870, 879 (D.C. Cir. 2022). In the context of the en banc court overturning another en banc decision, especially when that decision involves statutory interpretation, I am convinced that the doctrine of stare decisis is in force to its fullest extent. 34 The majority faults Appellees for failing to apply the typical stare decisis factors. But it is Appellants, not Appellees, who carry the substantial burden of demonstrating why overturning Clements is appropriate. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 17273 (1989). 35 Even if they managed more than a single reference to the doctrine, Appellants\u2019 case would still fail. After all, we heard essentially the same arguments they make today more than four decades ago in Clements. Clements, 999 F.2d at 894-898 (discussing the text, purpose, and the implications of minority coalition claims). 59 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 60 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 dilution claim under \u00a7 2. Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13-14. At issue in Bartlett was the drawing of District 18, which encompassed portions of four North Carolina counties. Id. at 8. The district at issue was not a majority-minority district. Id. Even so, Black voters in District 18 had \u201cthe potential to join with majority [White] voters to elect the minority group\u2019s candidate of its choice.\u201d Id. In sum, District 18\u2019s Black citizens did not constitute a majority of voting age citizens, but a sufficient number of White voters were politically aligned with the Black voters and would thus allow the Black voters to elect their preferred candidate. The trial court disagreed. It concluded that \u201calthough African-Americans were not a majority of the voting-age population in District 18, the district was a \u2018de facto\u2019 majority-minority district.\u201d Id. at 9. This was \u201cbecause African Americans could get enough support from crossover majority voters to elect the African-Americans\u2019 preferred candidate.\u201d Id. The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed on the grounds that \u201cAfrican-Americans do not \u2018constitute a numerical majority of citizens of voting age\u2019\u201d within District 18. Id. The United States Supreme Court affirmed that decision. Id. at 14. In so doing, Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion made clear that \u00a7 2 \u201crequires a showing that minorities \u2018have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to . . . elect representatives of their choice.\u2019\u201d Id. at 14 (emphasis added). It further noted that allowing crossover groups to satisfy \u00a7 2 would significantly disrupt the Gingles \u201cmajority-minority\u201d requirement that had been in place for decades. Id. at 20. The plurality thus concluded that crossover districts cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2. Id. Referring to a minority group\u2019s right to form coalitions with White voters, the Court also stated that \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 2 grants special protection to a minority groups\u2019 right to form political coalitions.\u201d Id. at 15. The majority here contends this purportedly supports its position that minority coalitions are merely \u201cpolitical coalitions\u201d not protected by \u00a7 2 of the VRA. 60 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 61 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 This conclusion is misguided. For one, the plurality expressly chose not to extend its reasoning in Bartlett to minority coalitions. Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13-14 (\u201cBut that term risks confusion with coalition-district claims in which two minority groups form a coalition to elect the candidate of the coalition\u2019s choice. We do not address that type of coalition district here.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). But critically, the similarities between Bartlett and this case matter far less than the differences. In crossover districts, White voters must vote with the minority population for the group to elect the candidate of its choice. Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13. White voters are not protected under the VRA and are not plaintiffs in the suit. Minority coalitions by contrast present a different scenario where each individual voter is indeed expressly protected by \u00a7 2 (a). Rather than being \u201cpolitical coalitions,\u201d36 these groups find cohesion in their shared history of disenfranchisement and the VRA\u2019s protections resulting therefrom. That difference makes all the difference. While the majority may believe otherwise, it cannot root its opinion in Supreme Court authority. To the contrary, a reading of Supreme Court precedent shows that the Court has allowed minority coalition claims on multiple occasions. 37 Bartlett does not cast doubt on that reality. Nor does any other intervening decision after Clements.38 _____________________ 36 The majority argues Plaintiffs are merely attempting to form a \u201cpolitical coalition.\u201d Given Galveston County\u2019s in-plain-sight political goals, however, the majority\u2019s concerns are misplaced. 37 Moreover, the Supreme Court has favorably recognized minority coalition claims numerous times. See, e.g., Carey, 430 U.S. at 150 n.5; Wright, 376 U.S. at 60. 38 The majority also relies on LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006), a case discussing \u201cinfluence districts,\u201d purporting that LULAC also weighs against minority coalition claims. But this argument is similarly unavailing. As the majority states, LULAC pertained to influence districts, where minority groups have \u201cinfluence\u201d in the election but do not constitute a majority. Id. at 445. Indeed, as the majority states, it is true that \u00a7 2 \u201crequires more than the ability to influence the outcome between some candidates, none of whom is their candidate of choice.\u201d Id. The issue in LULAC is, at best, tangentially related to the issue before us today. 61 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 62 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 It is clear to me at this juncture that the \u201conly relevant thing that has changed since [Clements] is the composition of this Court.\u201d39 Citizens United v. Fed. Elec. Comm\u2019n, 558 U.S. 310, 414 (2010) (Stevens, J., with whom Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, J. join, concurring in part and dissenting in part). This is doubly shown by the fact that \u201cthe majority opinion is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated dissents.\u201d Id. Finding no grounds to overturn our well-founded precedent, in my view, our discussion should end here. However, because the majority forges ahead, so do I. III Turning to matters of statutory interpretation, the majority contends that because \u00a7 2(b) refers to \u201ca class\u201d in the singular, plaintiffs who are members of different protected classes cannot coalesce to form a majority. The majority plucks these two words from the midst of the statute and insists that they constrict its scope. But this conclusion cannot survive basic principles of statutory interpretation and a review of the VRA\u2019s extensive legislative history. \u201cWhen interpreting a statute, we begin with \u2018the language of the statute itself.\u2019\u201d United States v. Orellana, 405 F.3d 360, 365 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting Consumer Prod. Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, _____________________ Of course, I agree LULAC requires minority coalition groups to demonstrate \u201cmore than the ability to influence the outcome between some candidates.\u201d Id. Instead, the coalition must prove it can satisfy each of the Gingles conditions\u2014including that the coalition can elect the candidate of its choice. But aside from clarifying this requirement, LULAC does not weigh, one way or another, on the question before us. 39 \u201cToday\u2019s ruling thus strikes at the vitals of stare decisis, \u2018the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion\u2019 that \u2018permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals.\u2019\u201d Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 414 (quoting Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 265 (1986)). 62 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 63 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 108 (1980)). \u201cWe follow the \u2018plain and unambiguous meaning of the statutory language,\u2019 interpreting undefined terms according to their ordinary and natural meaning and the overall policies and objectives of the statute.\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Kay, 359 F.3d 738, 742 (5th Cir. 2004)). In so doing, we must consider the basic principles of statutory interpretation outlined in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, including that the singular includes the plural. Seth B. ex rel. Donald B. v. Orleans Par. Sch. Bd., 810 F.3d 961, 975 n.52 (5th Cir. 2016) (\u201cIt is a basic rule of statutory construction that the singular includes the plural.\u201d See Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Gardner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 130 (2012) (quoting the rules of construction outlined in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1)). Moreover, \u201c[w]hether a statutory term is ambiguous . . . does not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words.\u201d Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 (2015). \u201cRather, \u2018the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined not only by reference to the language itself, but as well by the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997)) (alteration in original). \u201cIf the statute is ambiguous, we may look to the legislative history or agency interpretations for guidance.\u201d Orellana, 405 F.3d at 365. We are additionally guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate that \u201cthe [VRA] should be interpreted in a manner that provides \u2018the broadest possible scope\u2019 in combating racial discrimination.\u201d Chisom, 501 U.S. at 403. A The majority contends that, based on the text, \u00a7 2(b) clearly prohibits coalition groups. The majority takes issue with the language in \u00a7 2(b): \u201ca class of citizens,\u201d and \u201ca protected class.\u201d The majority contends that \u201c[h]ad Congress chosen explicitly to protect minority coalitions it could have 63 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 64 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 done so by [using the phrase] classes of citizens.\u201d But this misses the forest for the trees. To reach its conclusion, the majority must reject well-established methods of statutory interpretation, jumping through hoops to find exceptions. But it need not be so difficult, for the analysis is far simpler than the majority contends: minority coalition claims are permissible under the plain text of the statute. 1 A reading of \u00a7 2 and of the VRA as a whole demonstrates that a reading of the term a \u201cclass\u201d in the singular does not result in a prohibition of minority coalition claims. I turn first to the \u201cspecific context in which th[e] language is used\u201d within \u00a7 2 itself. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. In \u00a7 2, the singular term \u201ca class\u201d is encompassed by the larger phrase, \u201cmembers of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a).\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301. Consider the last antecedent rule. This method of construction \u201cprovides that \u2018a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying on the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\u2019\u201d Lockhart v. United States, 577 U.S. 347, 351 (2016). \u201cThe rule reflects the basic intuition that when a modifier appears at the end of a list, it is easier to apply that modifier only to the item directly before it.\u201d Id. Applied here, the phrase \u201cprotected by subsection (a)\u201d modifies the noun \u201ccitizens,\u201d not the more distant noun \u201ca class.\u201d Accordingly, \u201cit is not the singular class that must be composed of a racial or language minority protected under subsection (a) but rather each citizen that makes up the class.\u201d Sette, supra, at 2727. To hold that the statute requires each citizen to have the same minority status is an improper reading of \u00a7 2. 64 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 65 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Of course, as the majority points out, \u201cas with any canon of statutory interpretation, the rule of the last antecedent \u2018is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\u2019\u201d Lockhart, 577 U.S. at 352 (quoting Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003)). However, where, as here, the broader context \u201cfortifies the meaning th[e] principle commands,\u201d there is no reason to disturb the interpretation urged by the rule. Id. The broader context of \u00a7 2 within the VRA confirms the interpretation urged by the last antecedent rule. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341 (terms must be considered in \u201cthe broader context of the statute as a whole\u201d). It is \u201cgenerally presum[ed] that Congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.\u201d Intel Corp. Inv. Pol\u2019y Comm. v. Sulyma, 140 S. Ct. 768, 777 (2020). In 1975, Congress amended the VRA to require that states and political subdivisions provide voting materials, including ballots, in nonEnglish languages if a language minority makes up more than five percent of the citizens of voting age. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973aa-1b (codified as amended in 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10303(f)(3)). The VRA specifically states that the percentage must be made of \u201cmembers of a single language minority.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Had Congress intended to apply the same limiting requirement to \u00a7 2, it could have done so. But it never did. And on that basis, we must presume its omission was intentional. Sulyma, 140 S. Ct. at 777. Accordingly, the broader context of \u00a7 2 and the VRA illuminates that the term \u201cclass,\u201d written in the singular but encapsulating the plural, does not prohibit minority coalition claims. Cf. Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020) (\u201c[T]here [is no] such thing as a \u2018canon of donut holes,\u2019 in which Congress\u2019s failure to speak directly to a specific case that falls within a more general statutory rule creates a tacit exception.\u201d). 65 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 66 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 2 And what of the Dictionary Act? When interpreting the U.S. Code, the Dictionary Act provides a starting point. 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (2024). The Dictionary Act \u201ctells us to assume \u2018words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things,\u2019 unless statutory context indicates otherwise.\u201d Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 164 (2021) (quoting 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). \u201cThe Dictionary Act does not transform every use of the singular \u2018a\u2019 into the plural \u2018several.\u2019\u201d Id. \u201cInstead, it tells us . . . that a statute using the singular \u2018a\u2019 can apply to multiple persons, parties, or things.\u201d Id. (holding an act requiring the government to send \u201ca notice\u201d would permit the government to send multiple notices but does not permit the government to send a notice via multiple documents). The Dictionary Act applies in all instances except where the provided definition \u201cseems not to fit,\u201d and the context \u201cexcus[es] the court from forcing a square peg into a round hole.\u201d Rowland v. Ca. Men\u2019s Colony, Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory Council, 506 U.S. 194, 200 (1993). In my view, the Dictionary Act tells us that the term \u201ca class\u201d can apply to multiple classes. End of story. The majority argues that the context indicates otherwise, pointing to the second sentence of \u00a7 2(b). That sentence provides, \u201c[t]he extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered\u201d when evaluating the final Gingles requirement\u2014whether the electoral process is \u201cequally open\u201d to the plaintiffs. 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b). The majority contends that an inquiry into the electoral success of a protected class makes sense only if it is restricted to a specific racial or language-minority group. After all, the argument goes, \u201cblack voters in San Antonio would hardly be persuaded that a vote dilution claim lacked merit simply because whites, a minority in the majority-Hispanic city, were being elected to local office. Nor would 66 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 67 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 Hispanics in Houston see citywide elected black politicians as evidence against any dilution of Hispanic votes.\u201d The majority\u2019s argument represents a misunderstanding of the Gingles analysis. By the time plaintiffs reach the question of whether the political process is \u201cequally open,\u201d they must have already satisfied the three Gingles preconditions, including political cohesiveness and that the majority votes as a bloc. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51. The second sentence of \u00a7 2(b) does not even come into play until these preconditions have been satisfied. So, if the final condition is reached, political cohesion must already be established. The majority stretches the second sentence of \u00a7 2(b) beyond reason. We cannot ignore one of the most \u201cbasic rule[s] of statutory construction\u201d on such unconvincing grounds. Scalia & Gardner, supra, at 130. B The legislative history further supports my interpretation. Though the majority would like the reader to believe that Congress has been silent with respect to minority coalitions, it has not. A review of the VRA\u2019s legislative history, as outlined in full above, indicates that the VRA was intended to extend to minority coalitions. Recall that, in 1975, Congress amended the VRA to make clear it prohibited discrimination \u201con account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in [\u00a7 1973b](f)(2),\u201d i.e., discrimination against language minority groups. Chisom, 501 U.S. at 392. As one mechanism to accomplish its goal, Congress prescribed that non-English language voting materials were required if a language minority makes up more than five percent of voting-age citizens within a state or subdivision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973aa-1b (codified as amended in 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10303(f)(3)). In so doing, Congress enacted language that specifically stated that the five percent must be made of \u201cmembers of a single language minority.\u201d Id. (emphasis added); 67 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 68 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 cf. Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 358 (\u201cWhen \u2018Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another\u2019 . . . this Court \u2018presumes\u2019 that Congress intended a difference in meaning.\u201d) (alteration in original). This is an explicit, non-ambiguous indication that, if Congress wished for specific requirements to apply to the VRA, it would (and did) enact them. Also in 1975, Congress specifically and favorably relied on minority coalition cases in adopting the 1975 Amendments. S. Rep. No. 94-295 (relying on Graves and CEDO). The legislative history also reveals that Congress relied on Carey and Wright\u2014both minority coalition suits\u2014in adopting the 1982 Amendments. S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 132, 173. Also recall that, in 1992, Congress recognized that language minority groups are, in effect, minority coalitions. Though there is only one category identifying all \u201cNative Americans\u201d as language minorities, Congress obviously understood the category to encompass speakers of many different languages. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 102315, at 9 (\u201cLack of access to absentee voting information to Native Americans in their native languages is further documented by their experience in the 1984 general election.\u201d) (emphasis added); id. (\u201cIn another example, election officials provided little or no information in Native American languages regarding the process for purging names from their jurisdictions\u2019 voter registration lists.\u201d) (emphasis added); id. at 14 (discussing costs, and noting that \u201c[i]n the case of traditionally unwritten languages, such as most Native American languages, only oral assistance is required\u201d) (emphasis added). Congress recognized the same with the category \u201cAsian Americans,\u201d which explicitly encompasses voters with many different language and ethnic backgrounds. Id. at 12 (stating that the category encompasses, inter alia, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Japanese voters). And in its 2006 Amendments, Congress specifically contemplated that minority groups could \u201ccoalesce\u201d or \u201ccombine\u201d with other racial 68 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 69 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 minorities to form a majority for the purpose of \u00a7 5 of the VRA, which, at the time, was amended to track nearly the same language as \u00a7 2. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 71 (\u201cVoting changes that leave a minority group less able to elect a preferred candidate of choice, either directly or when coalesced with other voters, cannot be precleared under Section 5.\u201d) (emphasis added); see also S. Rep. No. 109-295, at 21 (\u201cNaturally occurring majority-minority districts have long been the historical focus of the Voting Rights Act. They are the districts that would be created if legitimate, neutral principles of drawing district boundaries . . . were combined with the existence of a large and compact minority population to draw a district in which racial minorities form a majority.\u201d) (emphasis added). This should be dispositive. But I go on. C Let\u2019s return to the jurisprudence surrounding the VRA. The right to vote is one of the most highly-regarded constitutional rights. See Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 554. Through the Fifteenth Amendment and the VRA, Congress sought to address \u201cthe subtle, as well as the obvious\u201d forms of voting discrimination that plagued the Nation. Allen, 393 U.S. at 566. Indicative of Congress\u2019 intention to uphold the right to vote for all, the Supreme Court has mandated that the VRA \u201cshould be interpreted in a manner that provides \u2018the broadest possible scope\u2019 in combating racial discrimination.\u201d Chisom, 501 U.S. at 403. To effectuate its mandate, the Supreme Court gave us Gingles, providing a roadmap for determining if the right to vote had been violated via vote dilution. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51. Now consider the facts of this case. In its lengthy opinion, the district court dutifully applied Gingles.40 As to the second precondition, the district court found that \u201c[t]he statistical analyses from general elections, statistical _____________________ 40 The first precondition in particular is at issue on appeal. 69 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 70 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 analyses from primary elections, and non-statistical evidence of cohesion all support the conclusion that Black and Latino voters in Galveston County act as a coalition.\u201d In other words, the plaintiff class is \u201cpolitically cohesive.\u201d Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51. The district court also found that the third Gingles condition was met\u2014\u201cthat the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51. The court found that \u201c[t]he undisputed evidence shows that Anglo voters in Galveston County vote cohesively and for candidates opposing those supported by a majority of Black and Latino Voters . . . at a rate sufficient to defeat the minority-preferred candidate consistently in each of the enacted commissioners-court precincts.\u201d Finally, considering the totality of the circumstances, the district court found that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs have demonstrated that the totality of the circumstances shows that Black and Latino voters in Galveston County have \u2018less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\u2019\u201d When evaluating the totality of the circumstances, the district court noted that this was \u201cnot a typical redistricting case.\u201d Instead, the court noted, \u201c[w]hat happened here was stark and jarring.\u201d The district court found \u201cthe circumstances and effect of the enacted plan were \u2018mean-spirited\u2019 and \u2018egregious\u2019 given that \u2018there was absolutely no reason to make major changes to Precinct 3.\u2019\u201d The facts of this case are precisely the circumstances that the VRA sought to prevent: a \u201cwhite majority vot[ing] sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate\u201d (Gingles precondition three), resulting in the dilution of \u201cpolitically cohesive\u201d minority class (Gingles precondition two). But today, armed with only an atextual reading of \u00a7 2, the majority focuses on artificial subdivisions of the injured class, rather than focusing on the actions of Galveston County. To 70 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 71 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 imply, as the majority does, that discrimination is permissible so long as the victims of the discrimination are racially diverse, is not only an absurd conclusion but it is one with grave consequences. Last, I write briefly to point out the implications of the majority\u2019s outcome. Judge Keith lucidly warned the Sixth Circuit of such pitfalls in his eloquent dissent in Nixon: Perhaps what is most disturbing is that the practical effect of the majority\u2019s holding requires the adoption of some sort of racial purity test, so that minority group members can be properly identified and kept in their place. If we are to make these distinctions, where will they end? Must a community that would be considered racially both Black and Hispanic be segregated from other Blacks who are not Hispanic? Should the dwindling numbers of Native Americans be further decimated by a parsing of Navaho from Apache? Must Puerto\u2013Ricans and Dominicans in the same neighborhood be separated based on their separate cultural and historical backgrounds? Perhaps we will return to a time of classifying African\u2013Americans as quadroons and octoroons for the purposes of racial classification. Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1401-02 (internal citations omitted). The absurdities and judicial complicity in impossible racial classifications of which the dissent warns evinces the majority\u2019s unworkable standard.41 And moreover, it is _____________________ 41 The majority does nothing to dispel this concern. The majority contends only that the \u201cany part Black\u201d metric addresses the issues presented by its new standard, relying on Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 473 n.1 (2003). But how exactly? The majority may be addressing Judge Keith\u2019s rhetorical note about returning to a time \u201cof classifying AfricanAmericans as quadroons and octoroons,\u201d but the majority does not engage at all with Judge Keith\u2019s chief concerns about individuals who are multi-racial or multi-lingual. Moreover, the majority\u2019s reliance on Georgia v. Ashcroft for the proposition that the \u201cany part Black\u201d metric addresses these concerns is misplaced. In a footnote, the Supreme Court in Ashcroft uses the \u201cany part Black\u201d metric, but it notes that this metric may have less relevance \u201cif 71 Case: 23-40582 Document: 347-1 Page: 72 Date Filed: 08/01/2024 No. 23-40582 clearly contrary to the text of \u00a7 2 and Congress\u2019 intent in adopting and amending the VRA.42 * * * Because the majority\u2019s conclusion is atextual, ahistorical, and it allows the Constitution to \u201cma[k]e a promise which the Nation cannot keep,\u201d I dissent. Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1404 (Keith, J., dissenting) (quoting Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 443 (1967)). _____________________ the case involves a comparison of different minority groups.\u201d Id. This is, of course, the exact situation we are concerned with. 42 Announcing its own concerns, the majority warns that minority coalitions suits, even if unsuccessful, \u201care extraordinarily costly and time-consuming for public entities to litigate.\u201d This litigation resulted from Galveston County\u2019s decision to rid itself of a majority-minority district that had existed for decades. Rather than leave well enough alone, Galveston County chose to expend its resources on a map-making process that was riddled with discriminatory intent. In my opinion, we cannot allow the County to absolve itself of liability for its bad faith redistricting on the basis that defending Appellees\u2019 claims is costly. In other words, Galveston County brought this upon itself. 72\nSome case metadata and case summaries were written with the help of AI, which can produce inaccuracies.
