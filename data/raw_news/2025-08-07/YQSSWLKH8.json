  "title": "The 2026 MacBook Pro again rumored to get a major display upgrade",
  "description": "OLED panels are reportedly coming to Apple's high-end laptop.",
  "content": "While all eyes are on next year\u2019s rumored folding iPhone, Apple reportedly has big plans for the MacBook Pro, too.\n\nDealSite in South Korea reports that Apple has a deal in place with Samsung Display for OLED panels for the MacBook Pro, and that the first versions of the laptop equipped with OLED will hit the market by the end of 2026. The report follows a similar claim report made by The Elec, which stated that OLED MacBook Pros won\u2019t be available until 2026. In May of 2024, Omdia included the 2026 OLED MacBook Pros in its long-term forecast and repeated the prediction in July.\n\n2026 is when Apple will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the MacBook. While Apple isn\u2019t expected to release a special edition laptop to commemorate the event, the company may take the opportunity to introduce major new features or design changes. The current MacBook Pro uses mini-LED display panels, and an upgrade to OLED would improve the contrast and black levels.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the 2026 MacBook Pro will implement the Tandem OLED that Apple uses with the M4 iPad Pro. Tandem OLED is used to generate the brightness Apple wants for its pro products, so it seems likely that Apple would use it for the laptop.\n\nA recent report by Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman stated that Apple may wait until early 2026 to release the M5 MacBook Pro, though Gurman said that \u201cthe timing remains fluid.\u201d The M5 MacBook Pro is not expected to have an OLED display. That laptop is likely to feature a chip upgrade and few other new features.\n\nIf Apple does ship the M5 MacBook Pro in early 2026 and the OLED MacBook Pro (which would likely have an M6 chip) later in the year, it would make for a short product cycle. The M2 Pro/Max MacBook Pro was released in January 2023 and replaced by the M3 series in November 2023, which resulted in the shortest M-series cycle for the MacBook Pro so far.\n\nDealSite also reports that BOE, a display manufacturer, has ramped up its OLED production to gain a deal with Apple to supply iPad displays.",

      "text": "When the iPad arrived in 2010, it was instantly clear that Apple got it right. The tablet computer wasn\u2019t a new thing, but the design and interface of the iPad were on a different level, with a slim form factor, speedy processor, multi-touch interface, and a satisfying experience. It felt like a device from the future.\nNow that we\u2019re in that future, the original iPad seems like a relic with giant bezels and a thicker body than two of the latest iPads stacked together. The latest iPad Pro has a processor that\u2019s light years ahead of the A4 that shipped in the original iPad and a design that brings a significantly larger display in a body that\u2019s nearly 75 percent thinner:\nOriginal iPad\n- Height: 9.56 inches (242.8mm)\n- Width: 7.47 inches (189.7mm)\n- Depth: 0.5 inch (13.4mm)\n- Weight: 1.5 pounds\nM4 iPad Pro (11-inch)\n- Height: 9.83 inches (249.7mm)\n- Width: 6.99 inches (177.5mm)\n- Depth: 0.25 inch (5.3mm)\n- Weight: 0.98 pound\nThat\u2019s nothing short of remarkable. Yes, it\u2019s been 14 years, but few other devices have advanced like the iPad. Just compare the 15-inch MacBook Pro from 2010 to the 15-inch MacBook Air from 2024:\n15-inch MacBook Pro (mid-2010)\nHeight: 0.95 inch (2.41 cm)\nWidth: 14.35 inches (36.4 cm)\nDepth: 9.82 inches (24.9 cm)\nWeight: 5.6 pounds (2.54 kg)\n15-inch MacBook Air (M3)\nHeight: 0.45 inch (1.15 cm)\nWidth: 13.40 inches (34.04 cm)\nDepth: 9.35 inches (23.76 cm)\nWeight: 3.3 pounds (1.51 kg)5\nOf course, today\u2019s MacBook Air is thinner and lighter than the same-sized Pro from 2010, but keep in mind that Apple also dropped some features over the years to help trim the size, including Gigabit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports and an 8x slot-loading SuperDrive. That\u2019s generally how it works\u2014to get devices thinner, Apple removes legacy features, such as USB-A on the iMac and the 3.5mm jack on the iPhone. The result is almost always a compromise that tries to overshadow what was lost through a stunning design.\nBucking that trend, the iPad from 2024 is significantly better in every way than the 2010 model\u2014display, design, connectivity, performance, and features. Pick one up and it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s a real device and not some movie prop. And when you dive into what\u2019s inside it, it\u2019s practically impossible.\nLighter than Air\nWith a thickness of a quarter-inch, the iPad Pro simply doesn\u2019t make sense. How Apple can pack an OLED display, Face ID, an M4 chip, 1TB hard drive, 16GB of RAM, 12MP camera, and 10 hours of battery life into a ridiculously thin and light enclosure that blows away any other iPad is a marvel.\nEven if you compare the iPad Pro to Apple\u2019s other products, it\u2019s a standout, with a better processor than the MacBook Air, a better screen than the MacBook Pro, and a nicer design than the iPhone 15. It\u2019s arguably the best tablet ever made and one of the nicest designs to ever come out of Cupertino. And the front camera is finally in the right spot.\nIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think it was a Jony Ive creation. Just holding it brings back memories of the iPod nano or original MacBook Air. It\u2019s that shocking, especially when you consider it\u2019s also one of Apple\u2019s most powerful devices. Even the accessories are incredibly impressive. The Apple Pencil Pro improves on the 2nd-gen model with Find My, a new squeeze gesture and the Magic Keyboard manages to add function keys and a larger glass trackpad while keeping the incredible floating cantilever design.\nFoundry\nThe impossible dream\nSo why isn\u2019t the iPad Pro held in the same esteem as the MacBook Pro or iPhone Pro? Yes, it\u2019s expensive, but the starting price is quite a bit lower than the iPhone 15 Pro Max and MacBook Pro. The M4 iPad Pro should be Apple\u2019s most successful tablet, nay computer, but by all accounts, it\u2019s far and away the least popular.\nThe easiest explanation is the simplest one: iPadOS. Back in 2019, Apple decided to split iOS 13 into two, iOS for phones and iPadOS for tablets. It was a watershed moment\u2014or at least it should have been. However, after the initial release that delivered multitasking for the first, iPadOS hasn\u2019t really separated itself from iOS in any meaningful way other than the introduction of Stage Manager. Many of the best iOS features are delayed by a year and they all feel like they were designed for the iPhone first.\nFoundry\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the iPad still hasn\u2019t gained enough macOS features to challenge the productivity of a MacBook. It has the pieces\u2014a keyboard, trackpad, multitasking, gorgeous display, centered front camera, extreme portability, long battery life\u2014but most Apple users still reach for a MacBook when they need to get work done.\nIt\u2019s not like people don\u2019t love their iPads. Even on a down month, Apple still sells some $6 million worth of iPads, but that\u2019s the thing. The $999 iPad Pro is obviously better in every way than the $349 10th-gen iPad, but it\u2019s not all that evident in the things most people do with it. The things that make the M4 iPad Pro so impressive don\u2019t really matter as much on the iPad as they do on the iPhone or Mac. There are clear reasons to purchase a MacBook Pro or an iPhone Pro that you\u2019ll enjoy every day\u2014that\u2019s not the case with the iPad Pro. Yes, using it is impressive and you can certainly feel the speed, but ultimately you\u2019re not working any faster or smarter.\nAnd therein lies the problem. As much as the M4 iPad Pro should be the primary device, it still takes a backseat to the MacBook and iPhone. We\u2019ve come to expect the impossible from Apple, and with the M4 iPad Pro, it truly delivered it. But when the wonder wears off, you start to wonder where the possible is."

      "text": "We\u2019ve been reporting on the rumored \u201ccoming soon\u201d launch of a foldable iPhone for years. There have been strong and reliable rumors of a foldable iPhone being just two years away dating as far back as 2018, at least. Back then, reliable reports from the likes of CNBC said Apple was going to have a folding iPhone on the market in 2020.\nThat became 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025\u2026 and now it\u2019s scheduled to land in 2026 at the earliest.\nSo, while the rumors and reports from parts suppliers and analysts are heating up and seem to be more solid than ever, we would advise even more caution and skepticism than usual with Apple rumors. Having said that, here\u2019s what the current rumors suggest about the release of a folding iPhone.\nUpdate July 23, 2025: A report reiterates previous reports regarding the folding iPhone\u2019s display size.\nFolding iPhone: Release date\nAccording to a series of reports, the major design and specs of Apple\u2019s first folding phone are due to be finalized in the middle of 2025, with production targeted for late 2026. That would mean a launch late in 2026 or early 2027. So far, this timeline has been suggested by several sources in 2024 and 2025, including The Information, The Wall Street Journal, and analysts Ming-Chi Kuo and Mark Gurman.\nThe phone is expected to be complex and expensive to manufacture, so production volume will likely be very limited at first. A second model in late 2027 should see higher production numbers.\nGurman reported in July 2025 that Apple will focus on features for the folding iPhone in iOS 27, which will be released in the fall of 2026.\nFolding iPhone: Design\nIn 2024, The Information reported that Apple had made a couple of prototype \u201cclamshell\u201d flip-phone designs, where the top and bottom of the phone fold to meet. More recent rumors in 2025 from Digital Chat Station on Weibo and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggest a \u201cbook\u201d style fold, with a vertical fold as the left and right sides fold to meet each other. This is a similar style to the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold.\nLuke Baker\nThe hinge is expected to be one of its most unique features. Some reports have suggested it will be made of a titanium alloy, while Kup reported in March 2025 that Apple is exploring the use of LiquidMetal for \u201cdurability, enhancing screen flatness, and minimizing crease marks\u201d in the screen. Apple has received several patents for hinge designs, and it\u2019s unclear which the company will use in the final design.\nOn July 14, analyst Ming-Chi Ku reported that Apple figured out how to get rid of the fold crease by using metal plates to help \u201cdistribute and control bending stress,\u201d according to Kuo, which would help minimize creasing.\nFolding iPhone: Size and dimensions\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported on the folding iPhone\u2019s set of proposed design details. He says the book-style iPhone will have a 7.8-inch inside display when unfolded, and a 5.5-inch outer display. Kuo says Apple won\u2019t be satisfied until the phone\u2019s display is completely crease-free when opened.\nIn July, TrendForce reported that the folding iPhone would feature a 5.5-inch external display and a 7.8-inch internal display.\nThe folding phone is said to be at most 9.5mm thick when folded and 4.5mm when unfolded. For comparison, an iPhone 16 Pro Max is 8.5mm thick, and the thinnest iPhone of all time was the iPhone 6 at 6.9mm. The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to be around 6mm thick and possibly as thin as 5.5mm.\nFolding iPhone: Specs and features\nWe don\u2019t know what processor the folding iPhone will contain, but if it launches in 2026 as rumored, it will probably feature an A20 or A20 Pro\u2014some variant of the processor found in the iPhone 18.\nWe expect most iPhones to use Apple\u2019s own cellular modem and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chips by that time as well. They may even be integrated into the main system-on-chip.\nIDG\nDue to the very thin nature of the foldable iPhone, and the need for different front-facing cameras when folded up or unfolded, it will reportedly lack Face ID. Instead, Touch ID will be incorporated into the side button much as it is on the iPad Air and mini.\nThere will reportedly be two rear cameras (likely a standard wide and ultrawide) and two front-facing cameras, one for when the iPhone is folded closed and one for when it\u2019s open.\nBloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reported in July 2025 that Apple will focus on features for the folding iPhone in iOS 27, which will be released in the fall of 2026.\nFolding iPhone: Price\nExpect the folding iPhone to be a very high-end, ultra-premium model. The very first release is said to cost $2,000 or more and could start at $2,299, twice the highest-end iPhone Pro Max."

      "text": "A new report from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman details Apple\u2019s current release plans for the first half of 2026. Much of it was already expected, but the biggest scoop is that Apple is considering delaying the new M5 MacBook Pros\u2014originally slated to be released this fall\u2014until early next year.\nThis fall still looks pretty full. We\u2019ll have the new iPhone 17 lineup, including a new super-thin iPhone 17 Air, updated Apple Watches, new iPad Pro models, and perhaps an updated version of the Vision Pro headset and A18 Pro-powered MacBook.\nNew 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models were set to be released this fall, but Apple may release them early in 2026. \u201cThe timing remains fluid,\u201d Gurman notes. While nearly all the Apple Silicon MacBook Pros have been released in October or November, the M2 MacBook Pro was released in January of 2023, so this new timing is not unprecedented. Update MacBook Air laptops are also still expected to launch in the spring.\nLater in the spring, they\u2019ll be joined by an iPhone 17e, which is similar in scope to the iPhone 16e released this year, and a new entry-level iPad and iPad Air. The iPads and MacBooks are what are dubbed \u201cchip and ship\u201d models\u2014there aren\u2019t any major new features expected, just upgraded processors.\nApple is also expected to release its first external Mac monitor since the Studio Display was released in 2022. Not much is known about the new display\u2019s specs, other than that it is expected to remain at a 27-inch size. The current Studio Display is missing several higher-end features, including ProMotion and HDR.\nApple is still working on its affordable smart home hub product, which was supposed to be released this spring but was delayed due to its reliance on new Siri features and upgrades that have fallen far behind schedule. This device, which some call the \u201cHomePad,\u201d is now expected to launch in the first half of 2026.\nSo, according to Gurman, Apple\u2019s release lineup for the first half of 2026 includes these products:\n- M5 MacBook Pro\n- New Studio Display\n- iPhone 17e\n- iPad update\n- iPad Air update\n- M5 MacBook Air\n- Smart Home hub"

  "argos_summary": "Apple is reportedly planning to release OLED MacBook Pros by the end of 2026, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the MacBook. The company has partnered with Samsung Display for the OLED panels, while BOE is ramping up its OLED production to compete for iPad display contracts. Additionally, Apple may delay the release of the M5 MacBook Pro to early 2026, with the OLED version likely featuring an M6 chip later that year.",
