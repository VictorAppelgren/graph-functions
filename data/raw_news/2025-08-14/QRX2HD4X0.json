And then thirdly, how we can help platforms to become a financial technology player.\u201d\n\nAdyen\u2019s investment in infrastructure and its holding of banking licenses in Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom help the company build products that are relevant to its customers, Uytdehaage said.\n\nLooking ahead, Uytdehaage said Adyen will move quickly to add stablecoins if merchants see a need for them and if that technology proves to help move money quickly.\n\nAdyen is also tracking the rise of autonomous agents in online commerce. The company is preparing to help merchants cater to this business and prevent fraud.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our platform \u2014 our single platform globally \u2014 we have a couple of components in our platform that already are catered for this journey,\u201d Uytdehaage said during the call. \u201cWe have authentication, we have tokenization, we have a very good fraud system, and packaging this with the new needs of our merchants for Adyen\u2019s eCommerce will lead to the best product.\u201d",
