      "summary": "Joby Aviation’s stock surged 125% in the last quarter after a successful FAA‑controlled flight and new partnerships with ANA Holdings and L3Harris, boosting investor confidence despite a $407 million loss in the first half of 2025. The company’s share price now trades above analyst targets, with a 192.6% annual return that outpaces the US airline and market averages, yet its valuation score of 0/6 and a 14.2x price‑to‑book ratio signal potential overvaluation. Joby’s high volatility and unprofitable outlook contrast with projected revenue growth of 66.5% per year, leaving investors weighing speculative upside against fundamental risk.",
