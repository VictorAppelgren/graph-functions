  "description": "Apple TV+ is raising its price by 30%, following the path of many streamers who have increased their subscription costs.",
  "content": "Apple TV+, home of series including \u201cThe Studio\u201d and \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d is raising its subscription price by $3 to $12.99 a month.\n\nThe move comes as many streamers have been raising their prices, as the cost of production increases and the businesses are facing more pressure by investors to increase profits.\n\nApple TV+ launched in 2019 at a low price of $4.99 a month, positioned as a low-cost perk for people to watch high-quality shows and movies with a free trial if they bought Apple products such as iPhones and iPads. Since then, the streamer has raised its prices, mostly recently in October 2023 from $6.99 to $9.99.\n\nLike other tech giants, Apple has faced scrutiny from the Trump administration on its U.S. manufacturing presence. Earlier this year, when the Trump administration proposed increasing tariffs, some analysts were concerned about the adverse effect that would have on Apple\u2019s iPhone business, which makes iPhones in China.\n\nSince then, Apple has increased its commitment to manufacturing in the U.S., most recently pledging an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nIf Apple continues to face pressure on major businesses including the iPhone, it could cause the company to look at other aspects of its business that aren\u2019t drawing as much revenue, analysts have said.\n\nIn March, tech and business news site the Information reported that Apple TV+ is losing significant amounts of money. Analysts have long viewed Apple TV+ as part of the company\u2019s larger push into services to go along with its hardware.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The streaming service is part of Apple\u2019s larger services category, which brought in $27.4 billion in revenue in its fiscal third quarter, up 13% from a year earlier.\n\nUnlike other major streaming platforms, Apple TV+ does not offer an ad-supported version of its service.",

      "text": "The cheap streaming era is over. Here\u2019s why your bills are going up\n- Share via\nWhen a flood of streaming services entered the market four years ago, the free trials were plentiful and the prices were extremely low \u2014 with Apple TV+ selling for just $4.99 a month and Disney+ charging a mere $6.99 a month.\nBut now, as those services become more established, subscription costs have ballooned. In 2022, prices for the 10 largest streamers have increased an average of 10% and increased 10% on average in 2023 thus far, according to the Convergence Research Group, a market research company. Fees are expected to increase even more next year, the firm said.\nFree, ad-supported streaming TV services are growing fast and expected to command significantly more advertising dollars this year.\nMedia companies are charging more as they struggle to transition from profitable but declining business models \u2014 like traditional television channels \u2014 to on-demand streaming services, many of which are still losing money. The surges in pricing come as consumers are grappling with inflation and broader economic uncertainty. People who abandoned expensive cable bundles in favor of cheaper streaming services are finding that their total monthly subscriptions add up quickly.\n\u201cThey had to start that low because they were nobodies, but now they\u2019re a plurality of TV viewing,\u201d said Mike Vorhaus, CEO of Vorhaus Advisors. \u201cSo what do you do when you control the market? You raise the prices.\u201d\nNetflix in July removed its cheapest ad-free option for new and returning members, which cost $9.99 a month. New subscribers now must choose between Netflix\u2019s cheaper ad-supported tier ($6.99 a month) or its standard commercial-free version ($15.49 a month).\nDuring the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings presentation, Netflix\u2019s CFO said the company was more than a year away from adjusting prices in the major countries where it operates. But the Wall Street Journal recently reported that Netflix planned to increase ad-free subscriptions after new contracts between major studios and the writers and actors guilds go into effect. Netflix declined to comment.\nRival streamers also have raised their prices. Last week, Discovery+ announced it will raise the fee for the ad-free plan by $2 to $8.99 plus taxes, and this month, ad-free Disney+ will go up by $3 to $13.99 a month. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ increased $2 to $6.99 a month in October 2022.\nSo why are costs going up, and what does it mean for consumers?\nGrowth from streaming video subscriptions is expected to slow significantly through 2030. Expect media companies like NBCUniversal and Amazon Studios to adopt new ways of making money.\nWhy are we paying more to stream shows?\nMany streamers are still losing money. Major studios were eager to chase Netflix\u2019s business model of spending billions of dollars in content to attract millions of subscribers worldwide. They entered the market with low prices to gain market share and Wall Street applauded companies that saw surging subscriber growth. That changed in 2022 when Netflix for the first time in more than 10 years lost 200,000 subscribers \u2014 which led to a course correction where now Wall Street values profitability.\nThe increase in new customers has slowed since the early days of the pandemic, when people were sheltered at home and yearning for more entertainment that they could access from their couches. The number of paid U.S. streaming subscriptions added from 2023 to 2025 is expected to run at just under half of the subscriptions added from 2020 to 2022, according to Convergence.\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t gain as many subscribers, they\u2019re going to have to increase their revenue at the end of the day,\u201d said Convergence President Brahm Eiley.\nWhile tech giants like Apple and Amazon make the bulk of their revenue through products and services outside of entertainment, companies such as Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros. Discovery are struggling with the transition to online streaming from traditional businesses, like linear pay television.\nProgrammers are expected to see less revenue from traditional TV advertising and fees as viewers cut the cable cord and television ratings decline. In 2022, the pay TV industry lost 7.4 million subscribers , and that decline is expected to get worse this year, Convergence said.\nIf entertainment companies want streaming to make up the difference, they have to hike prices.\nLong known as the \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports,\u2019 ESPN is grappling with cord-cutting, rising rights fees and skepticism from Wall Street.\nWhat effect will Hollywood strikes have?\nNew contracts for screenwriters and actors \u2014 coming after months of strikes by the Writers Guild of America and performers union SAG-AFTRA \u2014 will add additional costs to studios\u2019 budgets.\nThe WGA valued the deal at $233 million a year, compared to the $86 million a year it estimated for what the studios previously offered.\nThe WGA\u2019s membership has ratified the guild\u2019s agreement reached with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents major studios including Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and Sony. The agreement provides wage increases and additional payment for much-watched programs on subscription streaming services.\nThe 2023 writers\u2019 strike is over after the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers reached a deal.\nFilm and TV actors organized under SAG-AFTRA remain on strike and are continuing to negotiate with the AMPTP.\nTo be sure, services were likely to keep raising prices, with or without the dual strikes. But analysts expect the media and entertainment companies to pass the additional expenditures on to consumers while also pursuing other cost-saving measures.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re not profitable, you don\u2019t tend to increase your payroll at the end of the day, unless there\u2019s a massive opportunity for you,\u201d Eiley said. \u201cWhen your core business is not growing or declining and your new business is under tremendous competitive pressure you look to cut costs. ... If we had to forecast, the consumer is going to pay for it.\u201d\nSAG-AFTRA has approved a deal from the studios to end its historic strike. The actors were on strike for more than 100 days.\nHow much money can I save with ads and bundling?\nSome streaming services, including Netflix and Disney+, have added lower-cost subscriptions with ads while hiking the price of their regular streaming options. Amazon said next year it will add advertising to Prime Video. Customers who wish to see Amazon films and shows without ads in the U.S. will pay an additional $2.99 a month.\nAdvertising could help drum up more revenue for streamers, while the lower cost appeals to frugal consumers. Advertisers for years have been interested in promoting their brands to cord cutters and younger audiences on Netflix, which in the past had been averse to ads. Now, companies can air commercials on the ad-supported Netflix plan, targeting viewers based on what genres they watch, such as drama or sci-fi.\nEiley said that, in some cases, lower-priced ad-supported plans have a higher average revenue per user than more expensive paid ad-free plans. \u201c[T]he less expensive subscription approach makes sense with a maturing market,\u201d he said.\nOn average, ad-supported services cost consumers about 45% less than ad-free subscriptions, according to Convergence. Research firm Parks Associates estimates that if consumers were to move all of their streaming services to cheaper ad-based tiers, they could save as much as $366 a year.\nAnalysts say it\u2019s a good deal for viewers, in part because there are also fewer ads on streaming than on traditional television (for now). Streaming advertising loads on average are at 40% of TV advertising loads, according to Convergence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer for a vast majority of consumers,\u201d Eiley said.\nThere\u2019s another option for viewers, which is becoming increasingly popular \u2014 free, ad-supported streaming services like the Roku Channel and Amazon Freevee.\nThere are actually things to talk about in Hollywood other than the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes \u2014 such as the Disney-Charter deal to end the blackout.\nSome companies that own multiple streaming services offer savings to consumers through bundling. For example, a package deal of Hulu and Disney+ with ads costs $9.99 a month, compared to $7.99 a month for ad-supported Disney+ on its own. The ad-free version of the Disney+ and Hulu duo costs $19.99. A trio of Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu costs $14.99 a month with ads as of Oct. 12.\nParamount Global, which previously offered Paramount+ and Showtime as a bundle, recently raised the price of its premium version of Paramount+ to $11.99 while adding Showtime content.\nOn average, bundles tend to save 20% to 40%, according to Convergence. Having multiple streaming services stitched together can make it easier for consumers who feel overwhelmed by the volume of entertainment choices and also expose them to other types of shows and movies that they might not see if they only subscribed to one service.\n\u201cThe biggest benefit to consumers is a ton of content,\u201d Vorhaus said. \u201cPeople have shown they want that. So far, we haven\u2019t seen that people are worried about spending $20, $40, $50, $60 a month for these services, and it\u2019s still cheaper than traditional cable.\u201d\nOther companies like YouTube and Hulu also offer live TV options along with access to on-demand streaming services.\nStaff writer Meg James contributed to this report."

      "text": "Say farewell to the AI bubble, and get ready for the crash\n- Share via\nMost people not deeply involved in the artificial intelligence frenzy may not have noticed, but perceptions of AI\u2019s relentless march toward becoming more intelligent than humans, even becoming a threat to humanity, came to a screeching halt Aug. 7.\nThat was the day when the most widely followed AI company, OpenAI, released GPT-5, an advanced product that the firm had long promised would put competitors to shame and launch a new revolution in this purportedly revolutionary technology.\nAs it happened, GPT-5 was a bust. It turned out to be less user-friendly and in many ways less capable than its predecessors in OpenAI\u2019s arsenal. It made the same sort of risible errors in answering users\u2019 prompts, was no better in math (or even worse), and not at all the advance that OpenAI and its chief executive, Sam Altman, had been talking up.\nAI companies are really buoying the American economy right now, and it\u2019s looking very bubble-shaped.\n\u2014 Alex Hanna, co-author, \u201cThe AI Con\u201d\n\u201cThe thought was that this growth would be exponential,\u201d says Alex Hanna, a technology critic and co-author (with Emily M. Bender of the University of Washington) of the indispensable new book \u201cThe AI Con: How to Fight Big Tech\u2019s Hype and Create the Future We Want.\u201d Instead, Hanna says, \u201cWe\u2019re hitting a wall.\u201d\nThe consequences go beyond how so many business leaders and ordinary Americans have been led to expect, even fear, the penetration of AI into our lives. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested by venture capitalists and major corporations such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft in OpenAI and its multitude of fellow AI labs, even though none of the AI labs has turned a profit.\nPublic companies have scurried to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices, much as an earlier generation of businesses promoted themselves as \u201cdot-coms\u201d in the 1990s to look more glittery in investors\u2019 eyes.\nNvidia, the maker of a high-powered chip powering AI research, plays almost the same role as a stock market leader that Intel Corp., another chip-maker, played in the 1990s \u2014 helping to prop up the bull market in equities.\nIf the promise of AI turns out to be as much of a mirage as dot-coms did, stock investors may face a painful reckoning.\nAI \u2018hallucinations\u2019 are causing lawyers professional embarrassment, sanctions from judges and lost cases. Why do they keep using it?\nThe cheerless rollout of GPT-5 could bring the day of reckoning closer. \u201cAI companies are really buoying the American economy right now, and it\u2019s looking very bubble-shaped,\u201d Hanna told me.\nThe rollout was so disappointing that it shined a spotlight on the degree that the whole AI industry has been dependent on hype.\nHere\u2019s Altman, speaking just before the unveiling of GPT-5, comparing it with its immediate predecessor, GPT-4o: \u201cGPT-4o maybe it was like talking to a college student,\u201d he said. \u201cWith GPT-5 now it\u2019s like talking to an expert \u2014 a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything any area you need on demand ... whatever your goals are.\u201d\nWell, not so much. When one user asked it to produce a map of the U.S. with all the states labeled, GPT-5 extruded a fantasyland, including states such as Tonnessee, Mississipo and West Wigina. Another prompted the model for a list of the first 12 presidents, with names and pictures. It only came up with nine, including presidents Gearge Washington, John Quincy Adama and Thomason Jefferson.\nExperienced users of the new version\u2019s predecessor models were appalled, not least by OpenAI\u2019s decision to shut down access to its older versions and force users to rely on the new one. \u201cGPT5 is horrible,\u201d wrote a user on Reddit. \u201cShort replies that are insufficient, more obnoxious ai stylized talking, less \u2018personality\u2019 \u2026 and we don\u2019t have the option to just use other models.\u201d (OpenAI quickly relented, reopening access to the older versions.)\nThe tech media was also unimpressed. \u201cA bit of a dud,\u201d judged the website Futurism and Ars Technica termed the rollout \u201ca big mess.\u201d I asked OpenAI to comment on the dismal public reaction to GPT-5, but didn\u2019t hear back.\nNone of this means that the hype machine underpinning most public expectations of AI has taken a breather. Rather, it remains in overdrive.\nA projection of AI\u2019s development over the coming years published by something called the AI Futures Project under the title \u201cAI 2027\u201d states: \u201cWe predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution.\u201d\nShares in AI companies have powered a huge runup in the stock market this year, but users are beginning to question whether the craze will fall flat.\nThe rest of the document, mapping a course to late 2027 when an AI agent \u201cfinally understands its own cognition,\u201d is so loopily over the top that I wondered whether it wasn\u2019t meant as a parody of excessive AI hype. I asked its creators if that was so, but haven\u2019t received a reply.\nOne problem underscored by GPT-5\u2019s underwhelming rollout is that it exploded one of the most cherished principles of the AI world, which is that \u201cscaling up\u201d \u2014 endowing the technology with more computing power and more data \u2014 would bring the grail of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, ever closer to reality.\nThat\u2019s the principle undergirding the AI industry\u2019s vast expenditures on data centers and high-performance chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require about $3 trillion in capital just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would outstrip the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. But if AI won\u2019t scale up, most if not all that money will be wasted.\nAs Bender and Hanna point out in their book, AI promoters have kept investors and followers enthralled by relying on a vague public understanding of the term \u201cintelligence.\u201d AI bots seem intelligent, because they\u2019ve achieved the ability to seem coherent in their use of language. But that\u2019s different from cognition.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re imagining a mind behind the words,\u201d Hanna says, \u201cand that becomes associated with consciousness or intelligence. But the notion of general intelligence is not really well-defined.\u201d\nIndeed, as long ago as the 1960s, that phenomenon was noticed by Joseph Weizenbaum, the designer of the pioneering chatbot ELIZA, which replicated the responses of a psychotherapist so convincingly that even test subjects who knew they were conversing with a machine thought it displayed emotions and empathy.\n\u201cWhat I had not realized,\u201d Weizenbaum wrote in 1976, \u201cis that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.\u201d Weizenbaum warned that the \u201creckless anthropomorphization of the computer\u201d \u2014 that is, treating it as some sort of thinking companion \u2014 produced a \u201csimpleminded view of intelligence.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA chatbot was trained on a database of 200,000 books, including mine, without pay. How should authors like me think about that?\nThat tendency has been exploited by today\u2019s AI promoters. They label the frequent mistakes and fabrications produced by AI bots as \u201challucinations,\u201d which suggests that the bots have perceptions that may have gone slightly awry. But the bots \u201cdon\u2019t have perceptions,\u201d Bender and Hanna write, \u201cand suggesting that they do is yet more unhelpful anthropomorphization.\u201d\nThe general public may finally be cottoning on to the failed promise of AI more generally. Predictions that AI will lead to large-scale job losses in creative and STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math) might inspire feelings that the whole enterprise was a tech-industry scam from the outset.\nPredictions that AI would yield a burst of increased worker productivity haven\u2019t been fulfilled; in many fields, productivity declines, in part because workers have to be deployed to double-check AI outputs, lest their mistakes or fabrications find their way into mission-critical applications \u2014 legal briefs incorporating nonexistent precedents, medical prescriptions with life-threatening ramifications and so on.\nSome economists are dashing cold water on predictions of economic gains more generally. MIT economist Daron Acemoglu, for example, forecast last year that AI would produce an increase of only about 0.5% in U.S. productivity and an increase of about 1% in gross domestic product over the next 10 years, mere fractions of the AI camp\u2019s projections.\nThe value of Bender\u2019s and Hanna\u2019s book, and the lesson of GPT-5, is that they remind us that \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d isn\u2019t a scientific term or an engineering term. It\u2019s a marketing term. And that\u2019s true of all the chatter about AI eventually taking over the world.\n\u201cClaims around consciousness and sentience are a tactic to sell you on AI,\u201d Bender and Hanna write. So, too, is the talk about the billions, or trillions, to be made in AI. As with any technology, the profits will go to a small cadre, while the rest of us pay the price ... unless we gain a much clearer perception of what AI is, and more importantly, what it isn\u2019t.\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

The model made embarrassing errors, including creating a fantasy map of the U.S. with states like \u201cTonnessee\u201d and \u201cWest Wigina,\u201d and struggled with basic tasks like listing the first 12 presidents.\nAccording to the author\u2019s perspective, the AI industry represents a dangerous bubble reminiscent of the 1990s dot-com era, with hundreds of billions invested in AI companies despite none achieving profitability. The author contends that public companies are frantically announcing AI capabilities merely to inflate their stock prices, while Nvidia plays a similar market-propping role that Intel did during the previous tech bubble.\nThe author maintains that GPT-5\u2019s disappointing performance has shattered the fundamental \u201cscaling up\u201d principle that underpins AI development\u2014the belief that more computing power and data will lead to artificial general intelligence.

Companies like Amgen report that GPT-5 has met their high scientific accuracy standards and demonstrates improved navigation of ambiguous contexts compared to previous models[2].\nTechnology companies and developers offer evidence of GPT-5\u2019s superior capabilities, with Cursor describing it as \u201cthe smartest model [they\u2019ve] used\u201d and Windsurf reporting it has \u201chalf the tool calling error rate over other frontier models\u201d[3]. These assessments suggest meaningful technical progress rather than stagnation.\nIndustry leaders acknowledge implementation challenges while maintaining confidence in the underlying technology\u2019s trajectory, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman quickly responding to user feedback by promising doubled rate limits, restored access to older models, and personality improvements[1]. The company\u2019s rapid response demonstrates adaptability rather than fundamental failure.\nThe business integration of GPT-5 continues expanding across major enterprises including Microsoft platforms, with organizations like BNY, California State University, and T-Mobile already deploying AI systems for operational transformation[2][3].

      "text": "\u2018Nowhere to hide.\u2019 How Apple and others in Silicon Valley are bracing for Trump tariffs\n- Share via\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The iPhone is a quintessentially 21st century product \u2014 Californian in its creation and design and now enmeshed in the global economy.\nApple makes most of its iPhones in China, though in recent years the Cupertino-based company has made more of its products in India, Vietnam and other nations. In all, the tech giant says it relies on more than 50 countries and regions to put AirPods, iPads and MacBooks in the hands of consumers.\nNow, that global supply chain is under siege.\nThis week, President Trump said he would impose a baseline 10% tariff on imports from all countries on Saturday. His administration also added tariffs of 34% on China, 46% on Vietnam and 26% on India.\n\u201cApple has nowhere to hide,\u201d said Eric Harwit, professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. \u201cNo matter where they\u2019re making their technology, they\u2019re going to be suffering, they\u2019re going to see higher costs.\u201d\nKey drivers of Los Angeles\u2019 economy \u2014 trade and logistics \u2014 will be hard hit by the tariffs announced by the Trump administration, economists say.\nTrump\u2019s sweeping tariffs have rattled both investors and some of the world\u2019s most valuable tech companies that have fueled the global economy and Silicon Valley\u2019s growth. They\u2019ve also raised questions about whether these global businesses will pass the higher costs on to consumers or slash their payrolls.\nApple has been especially hard hit. Its stock plunged more than 9% on Thursday and dropped another 7% on Friday to close at $188.38.\nShare prices of other tech titans, including Google parent company Alphabet, Meta, chipmaker Nvidia and Amazon, also saw big declines, causing the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite to fall 5.8% on Friday \u2014 putting it more than 20% below its record set in December.\nThe unease reflects worries among investors that the tariffs could cause lasting damage, potentially making it harder for the U.S. tech industry to compete globally and dominate the race to deploy artificial intelligence technology, analysts said.\nThe duties also are expected to drive up the costs of consumer electronics, including the iPhone, as products become more expensive to produce.\n\u201cTechnology pervades everyday life and these tariffs are attacks on consumer electronics,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, vice president of technology policy at the Chamber of Progress, a trade group. \u201cThey\u2019re attacks on everything that we buy and that includes any foreign parts with global supply chains.\u201d\nThe levies could cause consumers to pay as much as $2,500 more for an iPhone, which costs roughly $1,000, depending on the model.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nMeta, Amazon and Alphabet also produce consumer gadgets but make billions of dollars annually from ads purchased by brands in other countries, which some analysts say could also drop if these advertisers pull back spending.\nMeta declined to comment, but its annual report cites the possibility that tariffs or a trade dispute could result in a drop for its China-based ad revenue. The company has also expanded production of its mixed reality headsets in Vietnam.\nAlphabet \u2014 which makes phones, earbuds, smart speakers and other consumer electronics \u2014 also has cited tariffs among the manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm its business. It did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe White House said it\u2019s imposing tariffs because it wants to shift more manufacturing jobs back to America.\nRelying too much on foreign producers could threaten economic security by \u201crendering U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply shocks,\u201d Trump said in his executive order.\n\u201cThese America First economic policies delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and everyone from Main Street to Wall Street is again going to thrive as President Trump secures our nation\u2019s economic future,\u201d said White House spokesman Kush Desai.\nHe cited recent multibillion-dollar commitments made by companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Apple to build more manufacturing plants in the United States.\nThe tech industry was bracing for more tariffs ahead of what the president dubbed \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d\nThe Trump administration already imposed tariffs on certain auto parts and imported aluminum and steel, materials that tech companies use to build data centers that store and manage computer hardware and equipment.\nThe administration spared those materials, along with copper, from its latest tariffs. Semiconductors that power electronics and AI systems also were excluded from what the White House dubbed \u201creciprocal tariffs.\u201d\nExactly how tech companies will respond to the costs of tariffs is still unclear. Although Trump wants businesses to shift manufacturing back to the United States, they could also move production to places with lower tariff rates. It would take years for businesses to build new factories.\nIt\u2019s also possible these tariffs will not remain.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, Apple got exemptions from tariffs imposed on imports from China for some of its products including its smartwatch. Trump\u2019s tariffs in his second term go well beyond China, affecting more countries.\nNick Vyas, founding director of the Randall R. Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute at USC\u2019s Marshall School of Business, said the Trump administration is signaling to businesses that simply shifting production to places outside China isn\u2019t enough.\n\u201c\u2018Every dollar that I open up my market for you, I need you to open up the market for me [to] the same degree,\u2019\u201d he said, describing Trump\u2019s thinking.\nSome tech companies have made efforts to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S.\nAmong them is Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker Nvidia, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies.\nAlthough it appears Nvidia would be spared from the brunt of the tariffs because of the exemption for semiconductors, some industry observers said more tariffs could still be coming.\nTrump told reporters on Thursday that \u201cchips are starting very soon\u201d when asked if tariffs for chips are off the table.\n\u201cWe\u2019re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around,\u201d Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at a Q&A with analysts last month. \u201cTariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we\u2019re going to have manufacturing onshore.\u201d\nApple in February said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. that would go toward various efforts, including opening a manufacturing facility in Houston.\nThe company said in its annual report that \u201csubstantially all\u201d of its manufacturing is done by partners primarily located in mainland China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nShifting where iPhones and other Apple products are made is not easy.\nChina has engineers who can meet the high quality specifications on Apple products and the U.S. doesn\u2019t have that great a number of engineers with those same skills, Harwit said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really that level of manufacturing expertise that Apple developed over many years that makes it very difficult for Apple to give up on China and for the U.S. to find the skilled workers really needed in the United States to meet their needs,\u201d he added.\nDaniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, said that it would take Apple three years and $30 billion to move just 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the U.S. Plus, the iPhone\u2019s price tag would grow to $3,500, he estimated.\n\u201cThe chances that Apple and the overall tech supply chain moves to the U.S. is a fantasy, fictional tale, unless you like $3,500 iPhones, $2,500 TVs and $300 AirPods,\u201d Ives said."

      "text": "Here\u2019s why you don\u2019t want the Trump administration to buy stock in Intel\n- Share via\nBack in 1935, the drafters of Social Security told Congress of their plans to build up a government pension reserve that would reach $47 billion.\nThe number shocked lawmakers. It was nearly three times the outstanding federal debt of the time.\n\u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name are you going to do with $47 billion?\u201d Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, Republican of Michigan, asked Arthur Altmeyer, one of the drafters.\nIf we\u2019re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.\n\u2014 Trump\u2019s rationale for taking stock in Intel (according to Commerce Secretary Lutnick)\n\u201cYou could invest it in U.S. Steel and some of the large corporations,\u201d Altmeyer suggested.\nVandenberg threw up his hands in horror. \u201cThat would be socialism!\u201d he exclaimed.\nYet the idea of federal government investments in public corporation stock has never died. It walks among us like a zombie today, with the Trump administration talking about taking a 10% ownership stake in the chipmaker Intel and musing about creating a sovereign wealth fund akin to those established by Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Norway and other countries.\nHere\u2019s what history tells us about the virtues of this idea for the United States: There aren\u2019t any.\nSuch funds \u201cusually reflect the quality of governance of the states that sponsor them,\u201d observed Steven Feldstein and Jodi Vittori of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in April. \u201cConsidering the Trump administration\u2019s self-dealing and erosion of accountability, there is an acute risk that the U.S. SWF could become a source of graft to reward Trump\u2019s friends, coerce political support for his priorities and bring personal enrichment.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the government said second-quarter GDP growth was 3% annualized. On Friday, the government said job growth had cratered, pointing to recession.\nLeaving aside the quality of governance in Trump\u2019s White House or legislators\u2019 fears of \u201csocialism,\u201d the idea of federal investment in public companies has never found lasting favor on Capitol Hill, for it has been almost impossible for lawmakers to overcome the touchy economic, political and philosophical issues.\nA federal fund with the authority to purchase corporate stock would be one of the largest and most potent investors in the market. As I wrote in 2005, when the idea of allowing Social Security to invest its trust fund in equities was under consideration again, the potential for conflicts of interest is inescapable.\nThe government might be a major shareholder in a corporation it was prosecuting for criminal activity. The government might end up on one side of an international issue as a member of a coalition of nations, and on the opposite side as a shareholder.\nIts financial interests might stand in opposition to its social interests: In his 1999 State of the Union message, for example, President Clinton simultaneously threatened to sue the tobacco industry over its threat to public health, and advocated allowing Social Security to invest in all equities \u2014 tobacco included.\nIn 1935, Congress addressed the conundrum by mandating that the Social Security Administration invest its reserves only in U.S. Treasury securities, a rule that exists to this day.\nSocial Security\u2019s would-be reformers periodically revive proposals to shift some of the program\u2019s trust fund \u2014 which held more than $2.7 trillion in treasuries at the end of last year \u2014 into equities, pointing to their superior long-term returns compared with bonds. But those efforts have never come to fruition.\nThe federal government taking an equity stake in a public company wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented. In 2009, the Obama administration acquired a 60.8% ownership of General Motors in return for almost $50 billion in bailout funds. The government also acquired a smaller stake in Chrysler, which was subsequently sold to Fiat.\nWith his tariff \u2018deals,\u2019 President Trump leaves international trade relationships even more unsettled than before.\nThe government sold the last of its GM holdings in 2013, booking a direct loss of about $10.5 billion. But its bailout has been deemed a success, given that it saved as many as 1.9 million jobs at GM, Chrysler and their suppliers.\nThe auto bailouts were emergency initiatives, taken to stave off what was shaping up as the auto industry\u2019s imminent collapse. Obama made clear that these were temporary measures and that the government would sell off its stockholdings as soon as that was practicable. The government abjured any control over GM\u2019s day-to-day operations, but it did orchestrate the exit of GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner, oversaw the replacement of a majority of its board members and imposed compensation limits on its top executives.\nThe auto bailouts followed numerous examples of U.S. government takeovers, or attempted takeovers, of private businesses. In 1791, Congress authorized the government to take a 20% stake in the Bank of the United States, and in 1816, to take the same stake in the Second Bank of the United States. These are seen today as precursors to the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank as a central banking authority.\nDuring the Great Depression, the Reconstruction Finance Corp., a Hoover creation that lived well into Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, took preferred shares in numerous impaired banks in return for capital infusions they needed to survive.\nBy the end of 1935, RFC-owned preferred stock amounted to nearly 40% of total bank common stock in the United States; the RFC\u2019s hard-charging chairman, Texan Jesse Jones, was not shy about imposing \u201creasonable\u201d compensation caps on its executives or replacing them when they faltered, or prodding their managements to make loans to private borrowers, a key element of FDR\u2019s program of economic recovery.\nZohran Mamdani\u2019s remarks about billionaires has the defenders of plutocrats in a tizzy. They should stop whining already.\nThe government also exercises effective control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored mortgage companies, via a conservatorship implemented in 2008, when the housing crash heralded the outset of the Great Recession. Stock in both companies remains in private hands, but warrants allow the government to acquire up to 79.9% of the common stock of each. Those warrants haven\u2019t been exercised, but they equate to firm government authority over the firms\u2019 activities.\nTrump\u2019s proposed Intel investment would occur in a very different economic environment and have very different features from any of those precursors. The terms of the plan have been murky.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed during an appearance on CNBC Tuesday that the government would demand Intel shares in return for the roughly $10 billion in funds allocated to Intel via the Biden-era CHIPS Act, which aimed to shore up America\u2019s position in high-tech hardware.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get equity in return for it.\u201d He quoted Trump as saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.\u201d\nA $10-billion stake would be about 10% of Intel\u2019s shares. That would make the government the company\u2019s largest shareholder, outstripping the stakes held by institutional investors Vanguard and BlackRock. Lutnick said the government wouldn\u2019t exercise voting rights or involve itself in governance. But he didn\u2019t talk about a time-limited ownership, or specify what corporate policies the Trump administration would favor. As it happens, Trump has publicly demanded the resignation Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, a Malaysian, over Tan\u2019s ostensible connections to China.\nDespite its stumbles in recent years, Intel doesn\u2019t appear to be facing extinction, as the automakers arguably did in 2008 and 2009. Nor would Intel\u2019s demise have anywhere near the impact on the U.S. economy that a GM collapse might have had amid the Great Recession.\nHiltzik: Crypto was already in bad odor before jumping into bed with Trump. Now it smells worse\nTrump\u2019s cryptocurrency deals have even Republicans getting concerned about the potential \u2014 and possibly the reality \u2014 of conflicts of interest and unconstitutional transactions.\nOnce the linchpin of the high-tech boom of the 1990s, Intel has plainly lost its mojo. As my colleague Queenie Wong reported, its strategic blunders have included missing out on the artificial intelligence investment boom that has made Nvidia, the maker of chips for AI development, a darling of today\u2019s stock market.\nIntel hasn\u2019t commented on the White House\u2019s interest in taking an equity stake, but Intel investors don\u2019t appear to know what to make of the idea. Shares in the company gained about 7% on Aug. 19, after Bloomberg first reported on the possibility, but have since fallen back, despite news that the Japanese investment firm SoftBank would take a $2-billion stake in the company.\nIntel shares fell 7% Wednesday in Nasdaq trading, closing at $23.54, a hair below their price prior to the Bloomberg report.\nWhether Trump could resist jawboning Intel, or any other companies in which the government holds shares, into instituting policies he favors is doubtful. He has frequently tried to exert pressure on CEOs of companies in which the government has no ownership, after all.\nThat concern would be heightened if the administration has control over a sovereign wealth fund. Trump aired that proposal via an executive order in February. The order called on Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to submit a plan by the beginning of May, but none has yet surfaced.\nA U.S. sovereign wealth fund wouldn\u2019t be based on the same principles as those of many other such ventures. \u201cSWFs have traditionally been set up by states rich in natural resources to manage their budgetary surplus, diversify their economies, and protect their wealth for future generations,\u201d observed the Carnegie Endowment\u2019s Feldstein and Vittori. That\u2019s the case with the funds of both Saudi Arabia and Norway. The U.S., however, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have excess funds to put into a SWF,\u201d Feldstein and Vittori write.\nIn a fact sheet accompanying the executive order, Trump mentioned $5.7 trillion in government assets, including \u201cnatural resource reserves.\u201d He has also talked about profits from crypto investments and the government take from tariffs \u2014 though the latter are essentially a tax on American consumers, who might have different ideas about how to spend the money.\nThe Carnegie researchers note that the most successful sovereign wealth funds such as Norway\u2019s \u201cmaintain operational independence and make investments based on rigorous financial criteria.\u201d Neither quality is a hallmark of the Trump administration.\nFeldstein and Vittori point out that by building a U.S. fund via tariff income or income from Trump\u2019s \u201cgold card\u201d proposal, which would give rich foreigners the right to live in the U.S. for a $5-million fee, might allow Trump to evade Congress\u2019s constitutional monopoly on raising and spending money and even allow him to manage the fund behind closed doors.\nStill, it would be up to Congress to establish the fund and oversee its operations. Will the lawmakers accept their responsibility? If not, Trump\u2019s idea is a dangerous one. \u201cGiving a president who aspires to be a king a potent financial weapon with ill-defined purposes and methods,\u201d Feldstein and Vittori write, \u201cpresents a grave risk to American democracy.\u201d\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A. Times Insights delivers AI-generated analysis on Voices content to offer all points of view. Insights does not appear on any news articles.\nViewpoint\nPerspectives\nThe following AI-generated content is powered by Perplexity. The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nThe proposal for government equity stakes in companies like Intel creates inherent conflicts of interest, as the federal government could find itself as a major shareholder in corporations it simultaneously prosecutes for criminal activity or opposes on international issues. Historical precedent from Social Security\u2019s design shows lawmakers\u2019 longstanding wariness of such arrangements, with Congress in 1935 mandating investment only in Treasury securities to avoid these complications.\nTrump\u2019s governance record raises particular concerns about potential abuse of a sovereign wealth fund or equity stakes, with risks that such vehicles could become sources of graft to reward political allies, coerce support, and enable personal enrichment rather than serving genuine public interests. The administration\u2019s track record of self-dealing and eroded accountability heightens these risks compared to more professionally managed sovereign wealth funds in other countries.\nUnlike successful government interventions such as the 2009 auto bailouts, which were emergency measures with clear exit strategies during an imminent industry collapse, the Intel investment lacks similar justification since the company does not face extinction and its potential demise would not devastate the broader economy. The auto bailouts were explicitly temporary with defined parameters, while the Intel proposal offers no such limitations or timeframes for divestiture.\nThe proposed sovereign wealth fund differs fundamentally from successful international models, as the United States lacks the budget surpluses from natural resources that typically fund such vehicles, instead relying on tariff revenues that essentially tax American consumers. This structure could potentially allow circumvention of Congress\u2019s constitutional authority over government spending and create opportunities for behind-closed-doors management without proper oversight.\nDifferent views on the topic\nThe Trump administration justifies the equity stake approach as ensuring taxpayers receive value for government investments, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explaining the logic as \u201cIf we\u2019re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action\u201d regarding the $10 billion in CHIPS Act funding already committed to Intel[1][2]. This transactional approach aims to create direct financial returns for the government rather than simply providing subsidies without equity participation.\nThe Intel equity stake represents a strategic move to strengthen U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry amid ongoing tensions with China, building on the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act framework while adding an ownership component that could provide ongoing influence over critical technology infrastructure[1][3]. This approach seeks to ensure sustained American leadership in crucial semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.\nGovernment equity participation has historical precedents of success, particularly the 2008-2009 auto industry bailouts that saved approximately 1.9 million jobs at General Motors, Chrysler, and their suppliers, demonstrating that temporary government ownership can preserve critical industrial capacity during challenging periods. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation during the Great Depression similarly took preferred shares in banks, helping stabilize the financial system while maintaining private operations.\nThe revenue-sharing model with companies like Nvidia and AMD, where the government takes a 15% cut of China sales in exchange for export licenses, provides a mechanism to monetize strategic trade decisions while maintaining national security controls[2][4]. This approach allows companies to access restricted markets while generating government revenue that could fund broader technological competitiveness initiatives."

      "text": "Apple ups the stakes in streaming wars with $4.99 a month price for Apple TV+\n- Share via\nCUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Seeking to stand apart from rivals, Apple Inc. on Tuesday stunned some industry analysts by offering a lower-than-expected price for its much-anticipated streaming service.\nThe tech giant said Tuesday that Apple TV+ would launch Nov. 1 for $4.99 a month \u2014 nearly half what some industry analysts had predicted.\n\u201cThe pricing of Apple\u2019s streaming TV service at $4.99 per month is a showstopper and a major shot across the bow at the likes of Netflix and Disney, among others,\u201d said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities.\nThe service will enter an already-crowded marketplace of streaming video services dominated by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu. And more competition is coming, with Walt Disney Co. and WarnerMedia offering their services later this year or next.\nBut Apple\u2019s streaming platform undercuts the price of its rivals. It\u2019s less expensive than Disney\u2019s upcoming streaming offering, Disney+, which will cost $6.99 monthly or $70 a year, and Netflix\u2019s basic plan, which costs $8.99 a month.\n\u201cLife just got tougher for Netflix,\u201d said Gene Munster, a managing partner with venture capital firm Loup Ventures. He said he initially expected Apple TV+ to charge $9.99 a month.\nApple said that the first shows on Apple TV+ will be available Nov. 1 in more than 100 countries and regions.\n\u201cAll of these incredible shows for the price of a single movie rental,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the media event, which was held in Steve Jobs Theater at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.\nAs an incentive, consumers will receive a year of Apple TV+ included when they buy Apple products, such as an iPhone or iPad, Cook said.\nApple said nine original programs will premiere with the Nov. 1 launch. Those include \u201cSee,\u201d a drama starring Jason Momoa; \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d about a broadcast morning show starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon; a coming-of-age story called \u201cDickinson\u201d; \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d a series about the global space race; the children\u2019s series \u201cHelpsters\u201d; and an animated original \u201cSnoopy in Space.\u201d\nThe content on these platforms will play a key role in drawing subscribers.\nApple has signed up high-profile directors, actors and celebrities to help it launch its service. Some industry insiders, however, have questioned Apple\u2019s content strategy.\nCook said there is strong demand for the upcoming shows, with trailers for \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d\n\u201cFor All Mankind\u201dand \u201cDickinson\u201d garnering more than 100 million views.\nOne advantage that Apple has is that people around the world already use iPhones, and streaming video content through Apple\u2019s own apps can be more convenient than having to download new ones.\nAs Oprah Winfrey, who is working on bringing documentaries to Apple TV+, noted at an Apple event in March, they\u2019re \u201cin a billion pockets, y\u2019all. That represents a major opportunity to make a genuine impact.\u201d\nThere are 900 million active iPhones worldwide, and Apple has the opportunity to gain 100 million consumers on the streaming front in the next three to four years, said Ives of Wedbush Securities.\nApple offers subscriptions to news with Apple News+ and the streaming music service Apple Music.\nApple has increased the number of services it is offering consumers, as the company looks for new ways to grow revenue. Sales of its flagship product, iPhones, declined 12% during the three months that ended June 29, compared with a year earlier.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings said in a July earnings call with investors that there is a battle for who will pay for content around the world, but he doesn\u2019t see it as a zero-sum competition. He believes people will subscribe to more than one service, noting that most Netflix employees are also HBO subscribers.\n\u201cWe love the content they do, and that spurs us on to want to be even better,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a great competition that helps grow the industry.\u201d\nWith just nine original programs at launch, Apple TV+\u2019s library will be much smaller than Netflix\u2019s, a person familiar with Netflix said.\n\u201cIt seems like apples to oranges, no pun intended,\u201d the person said.\nDuring Apple\u2019s media event, the company also unveiled new hardware products. Apple\u2019s new iPhones will resemble recent models but with better cameras and new colors. The most expensive models, the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, will now have three cameras on the back, including a new, wider-angle one to squeeze more of the landscape into the picture.\nThey start at $1,000, the same as before. The cheaper model, called the iPhone 11, will start at $700, down from $750 for the iPhone XR. It now gets two lenses instead of one. The lower price reverses a trend in which premium phones get more expensive as people upgrade them less often. The new phones come out Sept. 20.\nApple also announced Apple Watch Series 5, which will go on sale in stores Sept. 20. The new Watch, which starts at $399, will have features such as a built-in compass.\nAnd the company said it would launch its gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, on Sept. 19 for $4.99 a month, with a catalog of more than 100 exclusive games. Games include arcade baseball game \u201cBallastic Baseball\u201d from Gameloft.\nInformation from the Associated Press was used in this report."

      "text": "Apple commits another $100 billion for U.S. manufacturing amid Trump tariffs\n- Share via\nApple, which was singled out by the Trump administration earlier this year over its production practices, took a further step to highlight its commitment to boosting investment in the U.S.\nThe tech giant pledged to spend an additional $100 billion on domestic manufacturing, a move that could ease tensions with President Trump who wants iPhones built in the United States.\nApple also said for the first time all of the cover glass on iPhone and Apple Watch units will be made in the United States at Corning\u2019s Harrodsburg, Ky., manufacturing facility.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep building technologies at the heart of our products right here in America because we\u2019re a proud American company, and we believe deeply in the promise of this great nation,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a White House event.\nTrump praised Cook before the tech mogul opened a white box with Apple\u2019s logo, showcasing engraved glass before placing it on a base made of gold from Utah.\n\u201cThis is the largest investment Apple has ever made in America and anywhere else and it\u2019s just an honor to have you,\u201d Trump said.\nApple said it aims to bring more of its supply chain to the U.S. as part of a new manufacturing program, confirming an earlier report from Bloomberg.\nThe company said in a new release it is working with Samsung, Applied Materials and Texas Instruments, among other businesses.\nPresident Trump threatened to impose a tariff of at least 25% on Apple if the smartphone maker doesn\u2019t build and manufacture iPhones in the United States.\nApple\u2019s commitment will increase its U.S. investment to $600 billion over four years as it seeks to avoid the cost of tariffs.\nThe Cupertino-based company announced a $500-billion U.S. investment commitment in February.\nNonetheless, Trump in May criticized Apple for expanding iPhone production in India, threatening to hit the company with a 25% tariff.\nTrump said that his administration is placing a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors, but if companies such as Apple are building in the U.S. \u201cthere\u2019s no charge.\u201d\nApple and other tech companies have touted their U.S. commitments, but analysts and economists have said shifting manufacturing to the United States could take years and result in higher prices for smartphones and other popular electronics.\nSome analysts have said it would take at least five years for Apple to shift production to the U.S. and the prices of iPhones could reach $3,500 if the smartphone was made in America.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is made up of roughly 2,700 parts sourced from 187 suppliers in 28 countries, according to an April report from TechInsights.\nCook said at the press conference that Apple\u2019s iPhone will be made elsewhere for a while, but Trump said his administration might incentivize the company to bring that entirely back to the U.S.\nAs companies look to keep costs down and consumers watch their budgets, tariffs add another wrinkle to efforts to slash spending.\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement, that the Trump and Apple\u2019s announcement is \u201canother win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America\u2019s economic and national security.\u201d\nBusinesses that rely on goods imported from India are preparing for a 25% tariff to take effect as President Trump\u2019s trade war with once-strong trade partners continues.\nThe move marks the latest apparent effort by Apple to show its commitment to hiring U.S. workers.\nLast month, the smartphone leader announced the opening of its Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. The program begins Aug. 19 and offers free workshops on artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing to small and medium-sized businesses.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Apple has vowed to invest in U.S. manufacturing. In 2021, during the Biden administration, the smartphone maker said it would invest $430 billion over five years in the United States.\nTech companies including OpenAI, Taiwan semiconductor company TSMC and chipmaker Nvidia have tried to forge strong ties with Trump who has gone back and forth about tariffs.\nCook has been meeting with Trump and joined other tech executives who donated and attended the presidential inauguration earlier this year. Trump tapped Elon Musk, who runs Tesla and SpaceX, to lead a controversial effort to slash government spending. The White House hosted a crypto summit and released an AI action plan that benefits tech companies.\nApple has relied heavily on China to manufacture popular products such as the iPhone but has been diversifying its supply chain especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile there\u2019s a perception that companies turn to China because of low labor costs, Cook has said the smartphone maker benefits from the skills possessed by tooling engineers there that\u2019s needed to build a high-quality product.\nApple has more than 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers and partners across all 50 states.\nWhile Apple designs its products in California, it also relies on a global supply chain involving various countries including China, Vietnam and India.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s tariffs will significantly hurt Silicon Valley tech companies like Apple, which has manufacturing operations in China, Vietnam and India.\nApple is already spending more because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Last week, Cook said during an earnings call that the company has incurred roughly $800 million in tariff-related costs. Apple expects $1.1 billion in tariff-related costs in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September.\nApple\u2019s stock closed up 5% at 213.28 per share on Wednesday."

      "text": "Graffiti-tarnished towers in downtown L.A. remain in limbo\n- Share via\nEarly last year, vandals breached fencing, climbed dozens of flights of stairs and painted bold, colorful graffiti on the exterior of three unfinished high-rises that make up the abandoned Oceanwide Plaza development.\nThe so-called Graffiti Towers \u2014 visible from great distances on the 110 Freeway and looming over thousands of visitors attending events across the street at Crypto.com Arena \u2014 were expected to be sold in a bankruptcy auction a year ago.\nGraffiti artists made Oceanwide Plaza in downtown Los Angeles infamous. But a far more complex question looms over the real estate catastrophe: Can it be salvaged?\nBut the long-running bankruptcy sale of downtown Los Angeles\u2019 most spectacular eyesore drags on with no clear end in sight. Experts blame a confluence of factors, including high interest rates, rising construction costs and delays in attracting viable bidders.\nConstruction on what would have been one of the city\u2019s most notable landmarks, with high-rise housing, a hotel and a shopping center, halted in 2019 when Beijing-based conglomerate Oceanwide Holdings ran out of money to pay contractors after spending $1.2 billion on the complex that fills a large city block on Figueroa Street.\nBusiness leaders have expressed alarm that the graffiti some find artistic will prove embarrassing when global attention is focused on the World Cup next year and the Summer Olympics in 2028.\nResolution of the Oceanwide Plaza saga also can\u2019t come soon enough for many downtown stakeholders who see the graffitied towers \u2014 rising as high as 49 stories \u2014 as a dark presence besmirching the city and sending a negative message about the neighborhood.\nWith downtown\u2019s office rental market mired in high vacancies and falling values, stakeholders are clamoring for more city support to convert high-rises to housing that would help address the city\u2019s persistent housing shortage.\n\u201cThe Graffiti Towers have worldwide infamy at this point,\u201d said Cassy Horton, co-founder of the DTLA Residents Assn. \u201cIt\u2019s like this beacon that shines and says, \u2018Come create mischief down here and you won\u2019t get in trouble. This is the spot to do it.\u2019\u201d\nThe graffiti is likely to remain until a new owner takes on the painstaking task of removing it.\nMore than a year ago, a federal judge set a Sept. 17 auction of the property, saying there were several potential bidders. The winner of the auction ultimately wasn\u2019t able to come up with the promised purchase price and negotiations commenced with other bidders.\nThe real estate broker managing the sale, Mark Tarczynski of Colliers, declined to comment on the status of the sale but told real estate publication the Real Deal recently that two real estate development companies, one from the U.S. and one from abroad, are now competing as bidders. He said he anticipates closing the deal by the end of the year.\nThe purchase price, which would be used to pay creditors including general contractor Lendlease and EB-5 visa investors, would just be the beginning of expenses for the new owner. Estimates to complete the project reach $1 billion, even though it is about 60% completed.\nChallenges to get it done include market conditions that are hamstringing other planned real estate developments. Builders complain of high interest rates for borrowing money to finance construction.\nNew tariffs are driving up the cost of imported construction materials while raising uncertainty about how long the tariffs may last or what new ones may arise. Labor costs have also been increasing in recent years, and the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have added a destabilizing effect on the construction labor pool, industry observers have said.\nLos Angeles architect Douglas Hanson, who designed the 35-story Circa apartment complex next to Oceanwide Plaza, has an idea to shield people\u2019s gaze from the graffitied towers and bring in some money.\nHe suggests rolling down vinyl advertising signs that could be seen on the from the freeway on the west side of the complex and lowering other vinyl coverings on the east side that would display a beach scene or some other art.\n\u201cYou can get good money for advertising in that neighborhood,\u201d which allows large commercial displays, Hanson said. Ad revenue would more than pay for the signs, he said.\nThe buildings wouldn\u2019t be fully wrapped like a Christo art project, he said. \u201cJust drape them down and leave a little bit of the history of the building behind them.\u201d\nThe Oceanwide Plaza site was a sprawling asphalt lot used for event parking when Oceanwide Holdings bought it in 2014 with a vision to build a fancy, mixed-use development that was far bigger in scale than what is typically built in the U.S.\nOceanwide set to work on the complex, which was intended to house luxury condominiums, apartments, a five-star Park Hyatt hotel and an indoor mall that would include deluxe shops and restaurants. A massive electronic sign on its facade was to bring a flavor of Times Square to Figueroa Street.\nMany of the residents and visitors were expected to be Chinese citizens, but the country\u2019s government implemented tighter controls on money leaving the country in 2019 and the pool of potential condo buyers shrunk."

Apple is also committing an additional $100\u202fbillion to U.S. manufacturing to mitigate potential Trump tariffs and demonstrate a shift toward domestic production. The company\u2019s pricing moves come amid a crowded streaming market where rivals are adding ad\u2011supported tiers and raising fees, while Apple leverages its iPhone ecosystem to attract subscribers. Trump\u2019s tariff proposals and the AI hype bubble add economic uncertainty, prompting Apple to focus on supply\u2011chain resilience and service expansion. Together, these developments illustrate Apple\u2019s strategy to grow its services revenue while navigating geopolitical and market pressures.",
