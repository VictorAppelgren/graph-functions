      "feedback": "The draft is data-rich but unfocused for a 4–6 sentence executive brief; it should drop tangential micro-signals (e.g., hurricane channels, private-market sat’s) and tighten the backbone to a crisp house view anchored in first principles and defensible numbers. Actionable edits: 1) reframe into 4–6 concise bullets (base case, catalysts, risks, watch items, invalidation, scenario probabilities) with a single, explicit causal chain: cloud/AI capital intensity drives durable revenue visibility (backlogs) and pricing power, which supports higher cash-flow multiples unless labor/governance or macro shocks derail margins; 2) hard‑gate the numbers you actually rely on (e.g., 21.2% cloud CAGR 2024–2030; MSFT FY2025 Q4 revenue +18%, Azure/AI +39%, $368B backlog; Shopify 31% topline growth, $422M FCF, 16% FCF margin) and attach explicit thresholds (e.g., downgrade if MSFT backlog falls below $300B or cloud CAGR decelerates under 18% for two consecutive quarters); 3) consolidate the regime map into a single, four-regime view (base, upside, downside, crisis) with explicit invalidation triggers tied to data: e.g., AI productivity miss, backlog deterioration, or discount-rate shocks; 4) replace or relocate off-topic items (Range/private-market flavor, 0–3 week hurricane lens, Ford Gran Torino analogies) with one concise \"near-term catalysts and watch items\" line; 5) reconcile conflicts and keep sources tightly tied to the core thesis (cite 0G3A676BP for cloud/AI momentum; 4LQD15CFU/TN66GHPAT for labor/governance; JHGBQ4TQH for durability signals; UPV3X2MQ6 and FOM34PUWA for watch-item context) and provide a single-source line at the end.",
