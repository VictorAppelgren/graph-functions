      "feedback": "Actionable edits to upgrade to world-class, multi-year analysis: adopt a formal, horizon-aligned regime framework anchored on first-pr principles and invariant anchors (2% inflation target, Fed independence, and a policy rate around 4.25–4.5% with a data‑dependent path toward easing as Jackson Hole hints suggest) and clearly label Regimes (tight/high real rates; gradual, data‑dependent easing; long‑run neutral) with explicit transition conditions (inflation near target; tariff pass‑through fading; Powell’s easing signal) referencing OGK8WLL69; NL5YYTLF2; and the Jackson Hole context; 2) construct a precise causal chain from policy to pricing: lower discount rates and narrowing real rates lift present values of crypto/tech cash flows (including ETH staking yields and ETF inflows) and improve liquidity, while regulatory/news catalysts broaden institutional access (ETH ETFs inflows, staking, Bitmine’s $45m treasury buy; GENIUS Act; Project Crypto; Trump executive action); cite OGK8WLL69 for the policy/regulatory flow and 4) provide quantitative anchors: near-term prices around ETH ≈ 4,955 and BTC ≈ 124,496 high (with interim levels like ~4,800–4,900 and ~$110k–$125k in the mix, per OGK8WLL69 and full text); 3) lay out a concrete base‑case, upside and downside with event triggers (Powell rate‑cut timing; tariff pass‑through fading; ETF/treasury flows reversing; regulatory delays could invalidate the bullish case) and specify invalidation thresholds; 4) integrate the labor/identity macro channel (NL5YYTLF2) as a long‑horizon risk to demand and consumption that could soften or amplify equity/crypto cycles; 5) weave cross‑asset context (Ford’s cyclical profile as a risk proxy; 22PL3Q360) to show sectoral sensitivity under a slower‑growth regime; 6) tighten the narrative to avoid conflating retail hype with institutional adoption by presenting two parallel but reconcilable strands: crypto as an “essential” institutional asset and crypto as a volatile risk-on asset, with explicit reconciliation points; 7) improve citation discipline by tagging each substantive claim with the IDs (OGK8WLL69; NL5YYTLF2; 2QRLB974F; 1GVYF2V8O; 22PL3Q360) and ensure no sources outside the given set are used; 8) prune to a cohesive, executive-ready base-case with a clear “what to watch,” “key risks,” and “confidence” assessment, while preserving the five critical catalysts/triggers/invalidation lines and the implied multi‑year pacing.",
