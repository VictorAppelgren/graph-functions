  "content": "\u2022 Significant control over Fraport by state or government implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions\n\u2022 The top 2 shareholders own 52% of the company\n\u2022 23% of Fraport is held by Institutions\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Fraport AG (ETR:FRA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 31% to be precise, is state or government. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nPrivate companies, on the other hand, account for 26% of the company's stockholders.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Fraport.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Fraport\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Fraport?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nFraport already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Fraport's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nFraport is not owned by hedge funds. Land Hessen is currently the largest shareholder, with 31% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 21% and 8.4% of the stock.\n\nA more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 52% stake.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.",

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$321.0b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$158.18\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n7.2%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$69.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.07\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n25.5%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.3b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.70\n7D\n1.8%\n1Y\n24.6%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.2b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$237.56\n7D\n3.2%\n1Y\n29.1%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$52.0b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$170.88\n7D\n5.3%\n1Y\n-2.5%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.1b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.84\n7D\n2.5%\n1Y\n-15.5%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.3b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$101.66\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n33.4%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.45\n7D\n1.4%\n1Y\n10.4%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.70\n7D\n0.9%\n1Y\n19.8%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$40.70\n7D\n1.7%\n1Y\n-5.9%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$24.32\n7D\n2.5%\n1Y\n-27.1%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.6b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$31.20\n7D\n4.1%\n1Y\n43.1%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.5b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$24.47\n7D\n6.9%\n1Y\n19.0%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$554.8m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.53\n7D\n4.1%\n1Y\n-21.7%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$397.1m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.29\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n-37.6%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$253.2m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$20.68\n7D\n3.6%\n1Y\n-43.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$76.2m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.10\n7D\n2.8%\n1Y\n-0.1%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$38.7m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.82\n7D\n-1.3%\n1Y\n-56.6%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$1.3m\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0025\n7D\n78.6%\n1Y\n-75.0%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"

  "argos_summary": "Fraport AG, the operator of Frankfurt Airport, is heavily state\u2011owned with 31% held by government entities and 26% by private companies, while institutions hold 23% and the top two shareholders own 52% of the company. The airline\u2019s recent earnings show modest growth, with forecasts of 5.7% earnings and 3.5% revenue increases, but a high debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratio of 233.9% raises concerns about financial health. Analysts project modest future growth and a return on equity of 7.6% over three years, yet the company\u2019s valuation remains low at 2/6 on the Simply Wall St scorecard. In addition, the article highlights that Trump\u2019s 2025 executive orders on fossil fuels are expected to boost midstream oil and gas companies\u2014such as Williams, Kinder Morgan, and Cheniere\u2014by accelerating pipeline and storage projects and increasing demand for midstream services.",
