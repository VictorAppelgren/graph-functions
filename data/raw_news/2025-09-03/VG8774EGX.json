  "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., gives remarks to a crowd at St. Paul First Baptist Church on Wednesday, July 9, 2025, in Laurens, S.C. (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard) AP\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) trolled President Donald Trump for repeating a false claim about the water supply in Los Angeles.\n\nTrump on Wednesday accused Newsom of not allowing water from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles amid the devastating wildfires that raged across the area in January. Trump has repeated this claim for months, crediting himself with \u201cturning the water\u201d on to send to Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t allow the water to come from the Pacific Northwest. You know, they have tremendous amounts of water in California. People don\u2019t know. They send the water out to the Pacific Ocean. So I demanded it be open,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf that were open during the fire, before the fire, you wouldn\u2019t have the fire, because all the sprinklers would have worked in the houses. They had no water. They had no water in the fire hydrants. He wouldn\u2019t have had the fires,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsom mocked Trump for repeating this false claim on social media platform X. He posted a screenshot of a question posed to an artificial intelligence chatbot, seemingly accusing the president of having \u201cdementia.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo people with dementia repeat the same falsehoods and crazy conspiracies over and over again?\" the question stated.\n\nThe response stated: \u201cPeople with dementia often repeat the same statements, questions, and sometimes false or mistaken beliefs, primarily because of memory loss and impaired reasoning.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s press office also criticized Trump over the false claim, calling him a \u201cbumbling idiot\" on X.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the President of the United States is a bumbling idiot. THERE WAS PLENTY OF WATER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (IN FACT, STATE RESERVOIRS WERE AT HISTORIC HIGHS!)\u201d the press office wrote in one post.\n\n\u201cWater from the Pacific Northwest DOESN\u2019T EVEN connect with the state water systems. NOR does the water he wasted travel to the LA area!\u201d the office wrote in a separate post.\n\nNewsom\u2019s press office has been mocking Trump by mimicking the president\u2019s social media posts for weeks, often tweeting posts in all-caps and giving his political rivals new nicknames. The MAGA base and conservatives have complained about Newsom\u2019s new social media strategy, with many arguing that he is not being authentic.\n\nNewsom even took the trolling a step further last month by launching his own merchandise shop that mocks Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nThe shop includes a red hat that reads, \u201cNewsom was right about everything,\u201d which directly mocks Trump\u2019s own hat he was spotted wearing on Friday. The shop also includes a white tank top that reads, \u201cTrump is not hot,\u201d and a red hat that has \u201cReal Patriot\u201d written across it.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

The shop includes a red hat that reads, \u201cNewsom was right about everything,\u201d which directly mocks Trump\u2019s own hat he was spotted wearing on Friday.\nThe shop also includes a white tank top that reads, \u201cTrump is not hot,\u201d and a red hat that has \u201cReal Patriot\u201d written across it.\nAs of Sunday evening, Newsom said on social media platform X that the shop had sold over $100,000 worth of merchandise, including the complete sellout of his $100 signed bibles by Sunday afternoon.\nTrump was brutally mocked last year for selling \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d bibles for $60.\n\u201cWOW!

      "text": "Fox News anchor Dana Perino is being called out for her latest criticism of California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).\nNewsom\u2019s press office has been met with ire from critics in recent weeks as it has hopped on the offensive against President Donald Trump and MAGA, using insults, all-caps and memes to troll on X. Many of the posts are reminiscent of the president\u2019s messages on his Truth Social platform, with the account using Trump\u2019s popular sign off, \u201cThank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d\nWhile speaking on \u201cThe Five,\u201d Perino on Monday instructed Newsom to \u201cstop it with the Twitter thing.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where his wife is,\u201d Perino said. \u201cIf I were his wife, I would say, \u2018You are making a fool of yourself. Stop it.\u2019 Do not let your staff tweet, and if you\u2019re doing it yourself, put your phone away and start over.\u201d\nPerino acknowledged that Newsom has a \u201cbig job\u201d as governor, but then pivoted: \u201cIf he wants an even bigger job, he has to be a little more serious.\u201d\nSocial media users were quick to pounce on her point \u2014 with many pointing to how she seemingly forgot about Trump\u2019s own online communication style.\n\u201cThis is so funny,\u201d Bravo\u2019s Andy Cohen wrote on X.\nOne user said: \u201cBut she won\u2019t say the same about Trump? It seems like Gov. Newsom is hitting them exactly where it bugs them most.\u201d\n\u201cThis double standard is not just about social media etiquette it\u2019s a reflection of a broader political narrative where Trump\u2019s actions are normalized, while others are held to an impossible standard,\u201d another user posted, adding \u201cThe message is clear: for Trump, the rules don\u2019t apply, but for everyone else, they must be stringent and unforgiving.\u201d\nTom Nichols, a staff writer at The Atlantic, posted that Perino was \u201csoooo close to getting it.\u201d\nThe \u201cRepublicans against Trump\u201d account asked, \u201cDoes somebody want to remind her who the current president is?\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations to everyone past present and future who is falling into the most obvious trap in human history,\u201d Aaron Fritschner, the deputy chief of staff for Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), responded.\nWhile Newsom\u2019s social media team has poked fun at Trump officials and conservative media hosts and influencers, the account has specifically taken aim at the brewing California and Texas redistricting fight.\nNewsom announced last Thursday that he will move forward with a plan to combat a Republican-led effort in the Lone Star State to add up to five safe seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. He introduced his proposal, dubbed the \u201cElection Rigging Response Act,\u201d which would allow his state to sidestep its independent redistricting commission that has created district maps since 2010 if the Texas Legislature successfully passes a plan.\nIn the days leading up to his decision, Newsom issued a series of warnings to Trump, who has backed the GOP\u2019s attempt, to stand down.\n\u201cDONALD \u2018TACO\u2019 TRUMP, AS MANY CALL HIM, \u2018MISSED\u2019 THE DEADLINE!!! CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE \u2018BEAUTIFUL MAPS,\u2019 THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!),\u201d the account wrote last week.\nNewsom, who is seen as a potential contender for the 2028 presidential election, has also responded directly to social media users who have criticized his posts, as he continues to sarcastically capitalize on Trump\u2019s unnecessary use of punctuation and capitalization.\n\u201cTime for a weather alert,\u201d the account wrote on Monday, adding a barrage of snowflake emojis.\nStories by Rachel Cohen\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "Former White House communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin admitted on Tuesday that President Donald Trump is picking a \u201csmart fight\u201d with Democrats over crime in Chicago.\nDespite pushback from local and state officials, Trump has repeatedly threatened to send federal law enforcement into Chicago to deter crime in the nation\u2019s third largest city. Griffin said while sending the National Guard may not be the best solution, targeting crime in Chicago is a \u201csmart fight\u201d for Trump to pick.\n\u201cWell, listen two things can be true at once. Chicago has a crime problem, there\u2019s no doubt and Donald Trump knows that this is a smart fight for him to pick, not just with his base, but with the country. When you hear that stat Labor Day weekend alone, seven people killed, over 20 people shot with bullets,\u201d Griffin told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday.\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) has been staunchly opposed to Trump\u2019s potential plan to send the National Guard to Chicago. Griffin noted that Pritzker has acknowledged there is a crime problem in the city, but that sending federal law enforcement into Chicago may not be the solution.\n\u201cWhat Pritzker seems to be getting right that I don\u2019t think in some of the other instances we\u2019ve seen early on is acknowledge that there is a problem. It\u2019s not right or left to say we need less crime. We need fewer people to be shot in American cities,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut then have the debate over how to do it. National Guard has never been the first step that we should go to. You could coordinate with federal law, or law enforcement, work with the ATF, with the FBI,\u201d she continued.\nGriffin also noted that it\u2019s a \u201cbig test\u201d for Pritzker if he decides to run for the 2028 presidential election.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a big test for 2028 for Governor Pritzker, who clearly has ambitions in how he handles this, is going to matter,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can throw around the word authoritarian. I don\u2019t think most Americans like to see U.S. troops on American streets. I think it signals chaos. It makes people think of dark moments in American history, but they also don\u2019t like to hear that seven people were shot and killed over Labor Day weekend.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a place in the middle, and this is where it kind of comes down to the messaging wars, which Donald Trump is remarkably good at. He is good at convincing people that the way that they feel is true, that things are more dangerous than the stats may appear in these places. And so, I think Pritzker is going to need to find something better than \u2018We\u2019ve got this under control,\u2019\u201d she added.\nTrump criticized the leadership in Chicago in comments to reporters on Tuesday.\nThe president praised Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser for working with federal forces, but repeated his criticism of Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat. Trump said he\u2019d love to have Pritzker call and say, \u201cSend in the troops\u201d \u2014 even though the two-term governor has repeatedly said he won\u2019t be doing that.\nHe said if Pritzker would \u201ccall me up, I would love to do it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it. Because I have an obligation to protect this country and that includes Baltimore.\u201d\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nStories by Lauren Sforza\nOur journalism needs your support.

It features recreations of the White House interiors\u2014although the New York Times reported this month that the association is struggling to keep up with Trump\u2019s obsessive gold makeover of the Oval Office.\nOnline, social media commentators skewered the president\u2019s hat as a cringe attention ploy.\n\u201cImagine if any of us walked around in a hat with \u201c(insert our last name) was right about everything,\u201d wrote one commentator under Martin\u2019s X post. The guy gets more and more cringe by the day.\nAnother commentator added under the post, \u201cHe\u2019s making narcissism great again.\u201d\nYet others were decidedly impressed, writing, \u201cThe hat is a very nice touch.\u201d\nTrump has made his love of headwear no secret. During Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s Monday visit to the White House, accompanied by a phalanx of European allies to ensure all goes smoothly, Trump was photographed showing Zelensky his MAGA hat collection.\nThe moment again brought calls of cringe from social media commentators.\n\u201cOf all the things happening in the world he has to show off all his crap,\u201d wrote one commentator on X about the moment."

Gavin Newsom (D) over his response.\nThe wildfires tearing through the Los Angeles area have prompted thousands of evacuations and have resulted in at least two deaths as of Wednesday, according to local and state officials. Trump, in recent statements about the wildfires on Wednesday, criticized Newsom for his response and previous policies related to water management.\n\u201cGovernor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way. He wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn\u2019t work!), but didn\u2019t care about the people of California,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\u201cNow the ultimate price is being paid. I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA! He is the blame for this. On top of it all, no water for fire hydrants, not firefighting planes. A true disaster!\u201d Trump added, appearing to refer to reports that some fire hydrants in the area ran out of water.\nA spokesperson for Trump, Karoline Leavitt, also pointed to an order signed by Trump in 2020 that diverted water from Northern California to cities and farms in Southern California. But the Biden administration signed off on new rules for moving water across the state late last month, according to Politico.\nBefore Trump\u2019s post on Wednesday, Newsom appeared to take a shot at the president-elect while thanking President Joe Biden for his help during a Tuesday press conference. He said there was \u201cno politics\u201d and \u201cno kissing of the feet\u201d when he asked Biden for federal help.\n\u201cMy message to the incoming administration \u2014 and I\u2019m not here to play any politics \u2014 is please don\u2019t play any politics. There\u2019s a time and place for that,\u201c Newsom told reporters. \u201dAnd at this moment where your question only reinforces the moments, the precious moments that we have to evacuate, we don\u2019t have time for any of that.\"\nIn a later post on Wednesday, Trump took aim at Newsom again.\n\u201cAs of this moment, Gavin Newscum and his Los Angeles crew have contained exactly ZERO percent of the fire. It is burning at levels that even surpass last night. This is not Government. I can\u2019t wait till January 20th!\u201d he wrote.\nThe wildfires in Los Angeles worsened rapidly overnight starting on Tuesday.\nThree major blazes were burning in the metropolitan area, from the Pacific Coast inland to Pasadena, home of the famed Rose Parade. With thousands of firefighters already attacking the flames, the Los Angeles Fire Department put out a plea for off-duty firefighters to help. The efforts were further hampered by high winds that grounded water-dropping aircraft, but they returned to the skies by midday.\nIn addition to the two deaths, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said many others were hurt in the fires, which threatened at least 28,000 structures.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nStories by Lauren Sforza\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "A survivor of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking urged President Donald Trump on Wednesday to meet with her to prove that the Epstein files are not a \u201choax.\u201d\nSurvivors of Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking and their families stood outside Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to demand that Congress release the documents related to the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the disgraced financier. One survivor, Haley Robson, demanded to meet with Trump as he declares that the Epstein case is a \u201choax.\u201d\n\u201cMr. President, Donald J Trump, I am a registered Republican, not that that matters, because this is not political. However, I cordially invite you to the Capitol to meet me in person so you can understand this is not a hoax. We are real human beings. This is real trauma,\u201d Robson said.\nShe described that Trump\u2019s comments make her feel like she is \u201cbeing gutted from the inside out.\u201d\n\u201cI would like Donald J Trump and every person in America and around the world to humanize us, to see us for who we are, and to hear us for what we have to say. There is no hoax. The abuse was real. Now, what goes on behind closed doors? I can\u2019t speak for that. What happens around the world politically, I cannot speak for that. But I am here with all of these women, including our attorneys, and I would be more than happy to meet with him, and I will meet him halfway,\u201d she added.\nAs Congress returned this week following its August recess, lawmakers are debating over whether to release the files related to Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking case. Trump and his allies have pushed against the effort as the president repeatedly calls the case a \u201choax.\"\nTrump repeated those comments in remarks in the Oval Office when asked about the survivors who spoke outside the Capitol on Wednesday.\n\u201cThis is a Democrat hoax that never ends. It reminds me a little of the Kennedy situation. We gave them everything over and over again. More and more and more and nobody\u2019s ever satisfied,\" Trump said.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s really a Democrat hoax because they\u2019re trying to get people to talk about something that is totally irrelevant,\" he added.\nDemocrats lined up in the House chamber Tuesday evening to sign a petition from Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, to force a vote. Three other Republicans also supported the maneuver, but Massie would need two more GOP lawmakers and every Democrat to be successful.\nIf Massie, who is pressing for the bill alongside Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., is able to force a vote \u2014 which could take weeks \u2014 the legislation would still need to pass the Senate and be signed into law by Trump.\nThe clash suggests little has changed in Congress since late July, when Johnson sent lawmakers home early in hopes of cooling the political battle over the Epstein case. Members of both parties remain dissatisfied and are demanding more details on the years-old investigation into Epstein, the wealthy and well-connected financier whose 2019 death has sparked wide-ranging conspiracy theories and speculation.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nStories by Lauren Sforza\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "It turns out California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s newest strategy to mock President Donald Trump is \u201cabsolutely working,\u201d according to CNN analyst Harry Enten.\nIn recent weeks, one of Newsom\u2019s social media accounts has been mocking MAGA with Trump-style tweets criticizing the president and touting the California governor. While some MAGA pundits have decried Newsom\u2019s new strategy, Enten revealed Tuesday that Newsom\u2019s plan is actually working to gain attention.\nEnten said on \u201cLaura Coates Live\u201d that Newsom\u2019s press office account on social media platform X has increased its following by 450% since mid-June.\n\u201cThat account, get this, up 450% in terms of the number of followers since mid-June.And it\u2019s not just on Twitter, X, where Newsom is gaining. Even on TikTok and Instagram. His followers are up over a million since January alone. My goodness gracious,\u201d he said.\nHe said that daily Google searches for Newsom are up 1,300% since June 1 and up 500% since Aug. 1. Newsom\u2019s new social media strategy comes as he eyes a potential run for president in the 2028 election.\n\u201cSo, the bottom line is in politics, especially if you\u2019re thinking of entering in 2028, it\u2019s all about generating attention. And so far, Gavin Newsom has done a good job at generating attention,\u201d Enten said.\nBefore Enten\u2019s segment, CNN\u2019s Laura Coates played a clip of Fox News host Dana Perino complaining about Newsom\u2019s Trump-style tweets earlier this week.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where his wife is,\u201d Perino said. \u201cIf I were his wife, I would say, \u2018You are making a fool of yourself. Stop it.\u2019 Do not let your staff tweet, and if you\u2019re doing it yourself, put your phone away and start over.\"\nNewsom\u2019s press office account has taken to Trump\u2019s style of posting, including writing in all-caps tweets and signing the posts with \u201cThank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d. Critics, including Newsom\u2019s press office, pointed out that Perino criticized Newsom\u2019s posts but not similar ones by Trump\nIn the most recent post as of Wednesday morning, Newsom\u2019s press office jokingly took aim at Fox News\u2019 Greg Gutfeld for criticizing him. This tweet mimicked Trump\u2019s complaints about TV hosts\u2019 critical coverage of him.\n\u201cI SELDOM WATCH LOW-RATED \u2018GARBAGEMAN\u2019 GREG GUTFELD BUT, WHEN I DO, I MARVEL AT THE FAKE LAUGHTER ON THE SHOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE A BAD \u201cLAUGH MACHINE,\u201d IT\u2019S SO OBNOXIOUS AND DISGUSTING, JUST LIKE HIM, ALWAYS LAUGHING NO MATTER WHAT IS SAID. REAL PATRIOTS HATE IT WHEN FOX (\u201cEDITS THE TAPES\u201d) PUTS GARBAGEMAN GREG ON. FOX OUGHT TO \u201cGET SMART\u201d, AND NOT USE LOSERS LIKE THIS. ALSO, THEY SHOULDN\u2019T ALLOW NEGATIVE ADS ABOUT ME. THANK YOU!\" the account wrote on X.\nStories by Lauren Sforza\nOur journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com."

      "text": "In summary\nPresident-elect Donald Trump faulted California water policies for the devastating wildfires that are burning in Los Angeles County. The fires started because of fierce winds and extremely dry conditions.\nLea esta historia en Espa\u00f1ol\nThe Los Angeles County wildfires triggered a rant from President-elect Donald Trump, who blamed Gov. Gavin Newsom for depriving Southern California of water. Trump today repeated a claim he has made in the past, that state efforts \u201cto protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt\u201d have caused pain and hardship in California.\n\u201cGovernor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way,\u201d Trump wrote today on his social media site Truth Social.\nNewsom\u2019s office responded with a sharp rebuke and a reality check.\n\u201cThere is no such document as the water restoration declaration \u2013 that is pure fiction,\u201d Newsom communications director Izzy Gardon said in a written statement. \u201cThe Governor is focused on protecting people, not playing politics, and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need.\u201d\nThe fires burning in Los Angeles County were fanned by severe winds and exacerbated by near-zero rainfall throughout Southern California. But sending more water south from the Bay-Delta would have done nothing to prevent them or extinguish them.\nMark Gold, water scarcity director for the Natural Resources Defense Council and a board member of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, said Trump\u2019s comments do not reflect California\u2019s complex water supply systems and just fan flames of political discontent.\n\u201cTying Bay-Delta management into devastating wildfires that have cost people\u2019s lives and homes is nothing short of irresponsible, and it\u2019s happening at a time when the Metropolitan Water District has the most water stored in its system in the history of the agency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of having enough water coming from Northern California to put out a fire. It\u2019s about the continued devastating impacts of a changing climate.\u201d\nTrump appeared to be referring to water imported south from the Bay-Delta, fed by Northern California rivers and snowmelt. But most Los Angeles water does not come from Northern California. It comes via the city\u2019s 112-year-old aqueduct that runs from the Owens Valley east of the Sierra Nevada, not the Delta, as well as groundwater. The city also imports water from the Metropolitan Water District, which relays water from the Colorado River and Delta to numerous local agencies. The city was the main motivating force for the building of the Colorado River Aqueduct in the 1930s.\nIn December, the Biden administration and state officials agreed to a new long-term operating plan for the Delta water projects that effectively replaced rules produced by the first Trump administration in 2019 \u2014 an action that may have sparked Trump\u2019s latest social media post.\nThe new rules adjust water allocations for cities and farms and attempt to restore depleted populations of salmon and other fish, including the endangered Delta smelt. Some Central Valley farmers and Southern California cities will see more water and have endorsed the plan, while some farmers will get less. Water exports from the Delta to the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California via the State Water Project increase under the new plan.\nCalMatters reporter Alexei Koseff contributed to this story."
