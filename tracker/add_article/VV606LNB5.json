The call comes amid heightened concerns from European nations regarding Iran's uranium enrichment activities, which have escalated following the recent Iran-Israel conflict. The situation is complicated by Iran's cessation of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and threats against its director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi.",
