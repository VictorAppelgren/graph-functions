  "content": "Gaming these days is absolutely great. Not only do games run better than ever, and are generally more inventive, but they\u2019re also far easier to access. Heck, even if you only play free games, you can explore a huge range of genres and styles with no issues. It does come with one big drawback though, and that\u2019s having to deal with storage issues.\n\nWell, if you\u2019re an Xbox Series X or S owner, you can fix that today by getting this Seagate 2TB Storage Expansion Card for just $220. That\u2019s an absolutely massive $140 off the normal price, and this is one of the best storage options you can get for the Microsoft console. This deal isn\u2019t likely to stick around for long though.\n\nMore Games All The Time\n\nA single game can end up being hundreds of gigabytes in size, especially if you\u2019re someone who likes to play the latest triple-A titles. It means that even a large amount of space can end up gone in moments, and it\u2019s one of the reasons so many people end up grabbing extra storage space when they can. However, finding the right one for your situation can be tough. It\u2019s not tough at all here though, because this expansion card was quite literally made for the Xbox Series X and S.\n\nThis SSD expansion card works as soon as you plug it into your console. There\u2019s no messy installation required, and because it\u2019s not a PC, you barely have to do anything to open up your storage options. That\u2019s a big win if you\u2019re buying this for someone who isn\u2019t as comfortable with tech stuff.\n\nIt boasts incredible speeds and has a data transfer rate of up to 5000 megabytes per second, and read speeds of 1200 megabytes per second. This basically means that any games you store on it will run smoothly, and to still get the same amazing gameplay experience you\u2019d expect from your Xbox console. It even comes with a three-year warranty, just in case you\u2019re someone who worries about these kinds of things, or has kids or pets who may or may not cause chaos around you at all times.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why this massive storage device would normally cost you $360, so you shouldn\u2019t miss out on this chance to get it for $220 instead. We\u2019re not expecting it to stay at this price for very long, after all.",
