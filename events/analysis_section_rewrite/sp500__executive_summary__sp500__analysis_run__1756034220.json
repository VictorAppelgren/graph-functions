      "feedback": "The analysis currently overpuffs the breadth and violates the 4–6 sentence limit for a crisp investor brief; tighten to a single 4–6 sentence house view that explicitly links three first-principles anchors (platform moat, operating leverage from high-velocity ecosystems, cloud/AI tailwinds) to a concise causal chain and to Shopify’s metrics. Bind the core numbers to one coherent frame: H1 2025 GMV ~$163B (up 27%), revenue ~$5.0B (up 29%), operating income up 51% (QFDWCTAYB); Shopify’s ~12% of US e‑commerce GMV and Azure growth near 39% YoY should be cited once and placed as the demand/visibility backdrop (0G3A676BP, QFDWCTAYB). Establish explicit Base/Upside/Downside with concrete triggers and clear invalidations, e.g., Base: Azure growth in the high-single to mid-double digits and ACMR 2025 revenue guidance of 850–950m with 49% gross margin and D/E ~23%; Upside: AI tooling adoption accelerates margin/FCF expansion and a sharper re-rating; Downside: cloud demand decelerates or multiples compress meaningfully; attach targets to GX057ADL7, SK994CBWR, TN66GHPAT, 0G3A676BP, QFDWCTAYB. Replace diffuse, cross‑asset chatter with 3–4 tight watchpoints tied to testable data (e.g., Sept rate cut timing; 10‑year yield at 4.0–4.3%; IPO momentum like 95 deals in 2025 for a small‑cap tilt; IPO‑flow/quality signals from Q7VVGNSQE); ensure every assertion references an ID from SOURCE MATERIAL and resolve conflicts (e.g., GMV share vs. absolute GMV) by selecting a single framing and citing it. Finally, prune non‑core elements (e.g., broad asset-class analogies) or relocate them to a separate note; deliver the brief in a concise executive tone with the 4–6 sentence structure and single‑pass, source‑anchored accuracy.",
