  "content": "TheWorks.co.uk plc's (LON:WRKS ) stock didn't jump after it announced some healthy earnings. We think that investors might be worried about some concerning underlying factors.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nMany investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow, but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\n\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nFor the year to May 2025, TheWorks.co.uk had an accrual ratio of -1.92. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. Indeed, in the last twelve months it reported free cash flow of UK\u00a328m, well over the UK\u00a38.18m it reported in profit. TheWorks.co.uk's free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see. Having said that, there is more to the story. We can see that unusual items have impacted its statutory profit, and therefore the accrual ratio.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for TheWorks.co.uk\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nSurprisingly, given TheWorks.co.uk's accrual ratio implied strong cash conversion, its paper profit was actually boosted by UK\u00a34.6m in unusual items. While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution. When we crunched the numbers on thousands of publicly listed companies, we found that a boost from unusual items in a given year is often not repeated the next year. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. We can see that TheWorks.co.uk's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to May 2025. All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit a poor guide to underlying earnings power.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$321.0b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$158.18\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n7.2%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$69.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.07\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n25.5%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.3b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.70\n7D\n1.8%\n1Y\n24.6%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.2b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$237.56\n7D\n3.2%\n1Y\n29.1%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$52.0b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$170.88\n7D\n5.3%\n1Y\n-2.5%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.1b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.84\n7D\n2.5%\n1Y\n-15.5%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.3b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$101.66\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n33.4%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.45\n7D\n1.4%\n1Y\n10.4%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.70\n7D\n0.9%\n1Y\n19.8%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$40.70\n7D\n1.7%\n1Y\n-5.9%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$24.32\n7D\n2.5%\n1Y\n-27.1%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.6b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$31.20\n7D\n4.1%\n1Y\n43.1%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.5b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$24.47\n7D\n6.9%\n1Y\n19.0%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$554.8m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.53\n7D\n4.1%\n1Y\n-21.7%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$397.1m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.29\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n-37.6%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$253.2m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$20.68\n7D\n3.6%\n1Y\n-43.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$76.2m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.10\n7D\n2.8%\n1Y\n-0.1%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$38.7m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.82\n7D\n-1.3%\n1Y\n-56.6%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$1.3m\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0025\n7D\n78.6%\n1Y\n-75.0%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"

  "argos_summary": "TheWorks.co.uk plc (WRKS) reported healthy earnings for the year to May 2025, driven largely by a large one\u2011off gain of \u00a34.6\u202fm, but its accrual ratio of \u20131.92 indicates that free cash flow far exceeds net profit, suggesting strong cash conversion. Despite robust earnings growth (55.1% annualized) and a high return on equity (51.6%), the company\u2019s reliance on unusual items and a modest net margin of 3% raise caution for investors, as such gains may not recur. Market sentiment remains mixed, with recent volatility and a 1\u2011year share price rise of over 100% contrasting a 73% decline since IPO, reflecting uncertainty about the sustainability of its profitability and capital allocation.",
