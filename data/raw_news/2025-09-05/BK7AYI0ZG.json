  "description": "AI is transforming retail with personalization, efficiency, and engagement",
  "content": "By the time NRF 2025: Retail\u2019s Big Show Europe comes to Paris, the industry should know just how far the retail world has progressed \u2013 from the increasing use of agentic AI for customer relationships and communication through to AI as a supply chain optimizer, as retailers and brands look to build resilient and flexible supply chains to cope with rapidly changing environments.\n\nThis is a critical year in the blending of physical, digital and new technology. The retailers that thrive will be those who embrace everything from in-store customer service to new AI delivery and make it all feel part of one brand experience. Seamless integration of AI tools into both digital platforms and physical stores will be the defining feature of successful retailers in the near future.\n\nAgentic AI has become a major topic for retailers this year, as brands look to evaluate how technology can be used to engage with consumers and to answer questions and solve issues in real time. However, retailers must also balance the effectiveness of embracing technology with the ongoing need and desire for human contact and interaction\u2014something that remains a key differentiator for many shoppers.\n\nFirstly, it is worth noting that not all consumers are completely convinced of the benefits of AI and a recent report by London-based communications specialist Brunswick revealed an ongoing preference for human over AI interaction.\n\nThe report revealed the findings of a survey of over 5,000 consumers across five international markets and found that emotions have played a major part in shaping how consumers view AI. Asked about how they felt about AI, about half said that they felt nervous and the other half felt excited. This emotional split highlights a fundamental tension as retailers explore how to deploy AI: consumers are intrigued by its possibilities but wary of its implications.\n\nWhen it came to the use of AI as part of the retail experience, there are also clearly tensions between rational considerations and a more emotional response. While many consumers appreciate AI\u2019s ability to speed up service and improve product discovery, others feel uneasy about the loss of personal touch and potential privacy concerns.\n\nThe study also showed that concerns about AI are not generational, as might have been assumed. Consumers of different ages have mixed feelings about AI, which suggests that retailers need to consider attitudes across a broad demographic spectrum rather than assuming younger consumers will automatically embrace AI-driven solutions.\n\nThough consumers see the benefits of AI in terms of speed, efficiency and the increasing ease in finding products that meet their needs, there remains an expectation that AI tools should complement, rather than replace, human interaction.\n\nRetail leaders face a career-defining challenge in harnessing AI. The speed of development within AI has been incredible over the past 18 months, and now is the time to get beyond the hype and discover practical ways the retail industry can take advantage of AI.\n\nIn a very dynamic marketplace there are opportunities around accelerating product design, creating content and serving customers better. This is called \u2018agentic AI\u2019, where AI agents will not only serve consumers but will also become AI customers themselves, capable of making autonomous decisions to optimize retail operations and customer journeys.\n\nIt will be a blend of art and science for retail. AI will allow a multi-dimensional view of online products, for example, allowing consumers to make quicker and more accurate decisions which will improve the customer experience, satisfaction, and also reduce returns.\n\nAI-powered tools, live streaming and virtual tours of showrooms will all help remove hassles and make things easier for shoppers. Virtual try-ons and AI-driven personalization engines will allow shoppers to experience products digitally in highly realistic ways, which will boost confidence in their purchases.\n\nMoreover, AI\u2019s predictive capabilities will enable retailers to anticipate trends, stock the right products at the right times, and personalize marketing campaigns to individual preferences\u2014all contributing to better business outcomes and more satisfied customers.\n\nMuch of the interaction between shoppers and AI has been screen-led and focused on improving efficiency and reducing costs for retailers, as AI can typically handle most basic functions and queries. Chatbots, automated customer service, and AI recommendation engines have been widely adopted to streamline operations.\n\nHowever, the past 12 months has seen the rise of AI with a more personal feel to help improve engagement as well as to service functional requirements.\n\nThis shows both the opportunities and challenges facing retailers and brands as they evaluate how best to tackle AI and incorporate a new generation of technology at a time when the implementation of AI has moved from the testbed to live execution.\n\nVirtual influencers, AI avatars, and AI personalities have emerged as a new way to connect with consumers. These AI-driven figures engage audiences on social media, create marketing content, and embody brand values in a highly controlled and consistent way.\n\nUnlike human influencers, virtual influencers can operate continuously, are perfectly aligned with brand strategy, and can reach niche demographics with precision. They appeal especially to younger, digitally savvy consumers who expect authentic and immersive experiences online.\n\nAt the same time, brands must carefully consider issues of authenticity, transparency, and consumer trust when using virtual influencers. The ethical dimension of AI in marketing is becoming increasingly important, and successful brands will be those that use AI responsibly and openly.\n\nThe road ahead for AI in retail\n\nThe next few years will be crucial as retailers determine how best to integrate AI in ways that enhance rather than detract from the shopping experience.\n\nThe physical and digital worlds of retail are converging faster than ever before. AI will be a key enabler in this transformation, helping retailers build smarter supply chains, more personalized marketing, and more engaging customer service.\n\nYet successful adoption requires a balanced approach\u2014one that respects consumer concerns while harnessing AI\u2019s undeniable advantages.\n\nThe retailers who come out ahead will be those that combine technological innovation with a human-centric approach, delivering experiences that are not only efficient but also warm, authentic, and memorable.\n\nFor consumers, this means more personalized service, faster access to relevant products, and new ways to interact with brands they love. For retailers and brands, AI represents a powerful tool to build loyalty, increase operational resilience, and unlock new opportunities in a rapidly evolving marketplace.\n\nThe future of retail is intelligent, interactive, and integrated\u2014and AI will be at its heart.\n\nWe list the best Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "How Agentic AI is changing the game in CX and beyond\nRevolutionizing CX with autonomous, personalized, and proactive interactions\nThe rise of agentic AI is revolutionizing customer experience (CX) by introducing autonomous decision-making, real-time adaptability, and goal-driven intelligence. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily reacts to inputs, agentic AI takes initiative \u2013 anticipating customer needs, personalizing interactions, and optimizing business processes at an unprecedented scale.\nThis shift is redefining how businesses engage with customers, turning interactions into intelligent, dynamic experiences. While traditional AI has already streamlined operations, it often struggles with complex decision-making. That\u2019s where agentic AI steps in. Rather than simply automating tasks or following predefined prompts, it operates autonomously \u2013 empowering customers to take control of their journeys while AI works alongside them.\nBy anticipating needs, making real-time decisions, and delivering hyper-personalized experiences, agentic AI strengthens customer relationships, enhances decision-making, and creates engagement that keeps customers coming back. In an era where expectations for personalization are higher than ever, companies that successfully integrate agentic AI gain a competitive edge, not just improving customer loyalty, but positioning themselves as industry leaders.\nAgentic AI is more than just a tool for personalized recommendations \u2013 it enables businesses to create truly dynamic experiences that can change and enhance in real time. It doesn\u2019t just react to past behavior; it proactively builds customer relationships. By anticipating preferences and needs, it shifts from being a support system to a driving force in customer engagement, transforming brand experiences and fostering lasting loyalty.\nGlobal CEO of HGS.\nMaking an impact across industries\nAgentic AI crosses industry boundaries, making a difference in industries like telecom, finance, healthcare, logistics, and more. It isn\u2019t just about enhancing efficiency but reshaping the way businesses operate.\nFor example, in telecom, customers are looking for speed and hyper-personalization everywhere they look. Agentic AI can transform customer service by automating issue resolution, predicting network outages, and delivering hyper-personalized support. AI-driven virtual agents can troubleshoot issues, anticipate service needs, and provide seamless, real-time assistance, enhancing both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.\nSimilarly, in the finance industry, agentic AI can become indispensable for fraud protection and autonomous trading. By detecting anomalies and preventing fraud in real time, agentic AI can strengthen security and trust. In healthcare, it can offer personalized patient care through personalized treatment plans, resource optimization, and enhanced diagnostics. Logistics companies can leverage agentic AI to autonomously manage inventory, forecast demand, and plan delivery routes to enhance overall efficiencies.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nWith agentic AI, businesses can unlock new levels of adaptability and responsiveness \u2013 using it not just as a tool, but as an active partner in driving innovation, solving challenges, and elevating customer experiences.\nEthical implications of Agentic AI\nWhile agentic AI is a powerful solution, it also raises key ethical concerns, much like traditional AI. Because agentic AI operates with a higher degree of autonomy, strong security, compliance, and transparency measures are even more critical. Its ability to act independently requires enhanced human oversight to ensure these agents align with intended outcomes and don\u2019t introduce unintended risks.\nAs these agents become more capable and influential, companies must develop clear policies to ensure their behavior serves their purpose, safely. Customers need confidence that agentic AI systems are acting in their best interest and that their personal data is protected. If these systems learn from biased data, they can unintentionally favor some groups over others. To overcome that challenge, companies must invest in their data programs and have ongoing monitoring and safeguards.\nAt the same time, human interaction still matters. While agentic AI can enhance efficiency by handling complex or repetitive tasks, customers still value real people for more nuanced conversations. Finding the right balance between automation and human support ensures businesses provide both speed and a personal touch.\nStaying competitive in the age of Agentic AI\nAgentic AI is at the forefront of the AI revolution, leading the charge in transforming customer interactions across industries. As its presence continues to grow and evolve, its role will expand further into business operations with even more intuitive AI assistants, deeper emotional intelligence, and enhanced real-time decision-making abilities.\nCompanies that don\u2019t move fast enough risk falling behind. Agentic AI isn\u2019t just another tool \u2013 it\u2019s reshaping how businesses function. Business leaders need partners who can help them not only adopt the technology but also rethink their workflows to stay competitive. Big software companies may push expensive licenses, consulting firms focus on billable hours, and outsourcing companies may resist change to protect their revenue.\nTo effectively leverage agentic AI\u2019s potential, businesses should seek partners committed to real improvements \u2013 ones who align their success with helping companies use it in meaningful, practical ways. Implementing agentic AI solutions is more than just new technology; it requires agility, responsible implementation, and a willingness to rethink how work gets done \u2013 all of which ultimately lead to more seamless, personalized, and satisfying experiences for customers.\nWe've featured the best AI website builder.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Securing Agentic AI in retail: empowering action with safety\nHow secure, agentic AI transforms retail operations intelligently\nAgentic AI systems go beyond traditional machine learning and chatbots. They are capable of intelligently automating real-world workplace processes end-to-end. These systems operate based on goals \u2014 not just instructions. They reason, decide, and act, which is why industries like retail are putting agents into the hands of their frontline retail assistants.\nAI agents are making them more connected, giving them more visibility into inventory management and sales opportunities and requests, and intelligently automating tasks on the shop floor.\nPrincipal Cyber Security Architect, CTO Office, Zebra Technologies.\nFor example, an agent can interpret a customer\u2019s return request and automatically trigger the associated logistics workflows. This includes initiating return approval, notifying the warehouse, and updating stock levels in near real time. They will be a digital autonomous worker augmenting the frontline worker.\nAgents can also monitor inventory across locations and autonomously place supplier orders based on current trends. This kind of real-time optimization helps prevent overstocking or stockouts without manual intervention.\nThey can coordinate promotional activity by updating pricing across e-commerce, POS, and marketing systems. This ensures consistency and timeliness during time-sensitive campaigns. Some agents can even pull data from internal dashboards and external tools to create concise executive summaries \u2014 surfacing key insights for decision-makers.\nWhy Security is a Key Design Concern\nAgentic AI unlocks massive value \u2014 but it also increases the system's responsibility. These agents take steps that can directly affect operations, revenue, and customer experience. There are some real-world concerns that developers, IT and operational technology leaders need to be aware of and address:\n\u2022 Prompt manipulation: malicious inputs \u2014 from customers or attackers \u2014 can cause agents to behave unpredictably, such as altering orders or issuing refunds.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\n\u2022 Tool misuse: an agent might access internal tools like pricing APIs or campaign systems not intended for autonomous control, creating unapproved changes.\n\u2022 Oversight failures: without business logic context, an agent might repeat a failed task multiple times, unintentionally escalating an error, which could impact revenues or tarnish the companies Brand.\n\u2022 Data leakage: AI-generated outputs could reveal confidential product performance, SKU-level details, or inventory patterns if not properly controlled.\n\u2022 Automation drift: over time, agents may subtly shift behavior without detection, eventually misaligning with business goals or policies.\n\u2022 Firewall / access control: clear rules on who and what can communicate with and through the Agent to prevent hijacking or misuse of the agent\nThese are not theoretical; they\u2019re practical risks that increase with automation. The solution is not to avoid agentic AI \u2014 but to deploy it with secure, observable limits and governed design and collaboration with partners who can provide the agents, implementation, IT and developer support needed.\nA Secure Lifecycle for Retail AI Agents\nTo deploy agentic AI responsibly, IT and OT leaders in industries like retail must embrace a lifecycle approach that balances innovation with control. This begins by defining clear agent boundaries by being explicit about what the agent is allowed to do autonomously, with a human-in-the-loop authorizing it \u2014 and equally clear about what it should never attempt.\nWhether it\u2019s initiating refunds, accessing customer data, or editing product listings, hard lines need to be drawn around the agent\u2019s authority to prevent scope creep.\nNext, consider threat model early in the design process using industry standards, and think like an adversary: how could someone trick the agent? Could it be misused internally or externally? Could it escalate its access? Mapping out abuse scenarios in advance helps identify controls before the agent ever sees production.\nLook at hardening the prompts and internal logic the agent relies on. Avoid building agents that are overly general or capable of improvising beyond their business intent. Guardrails in how agents interpret instructions, reason through tasks, and make decisions are critical for safe autonomy.\nAnd test collaboratively across teams before going live. Involve AI developers, operations, business stakeholders and security teams. This cross-functional testing helps uncover blind spots and ensures the agent performs safely across real-world use cases.\nFinally, monitor and retrain agents post-launch. Behavior can drift over time \u2014 even in systems without direct learning loops. Set up real-time monitoring and observability pipelines, performance thresholds, and retraining checkpoints. Treat agents like evolving operational systems, not static deployments.\nFive Principles for Secure Agentic AI in Retail\nAgentic AI is a game-changer for industry \u2014 enabling faster decisions, connected frontline workers and intelligently automated operations. It\u2019s an intelligent teammate that requires thoughtful onboarding, boundaries, and oversight.\n1. Start with least privilege: give agents access only to the APIs and datasets they require \u2014 no more. Use access scopes, allowlists, and granular permissions. Avoid giving full control to agents unless business-critical and thoroughly vetted.\n2. Harden the input surface: before feeding customer input into an agent, sanitize and validate it. Apply AI firewalls or prompt guards to prevent instruction injection. Clearly separate user inputs from system prompts to prevent confusion or abuse.\n3. Observe more than outputs: log what the agent did and how it made its decisions. Track internal reasoning, external API calls, and unusual behavior like repeated refund attempts. Observation should go deeper than final outputs.\n4. Isolate and control execution: run agents in sandboxed or staged environments for high-risk tasks. Restrict their internet access unless required. Use just-in-time credentials and frequently rotate tokens to minimize attack surfaces.\n5. Test like an adversary: simulate edge cases, abuse inputs, and worst-case scenarios before production deployment. Ensure agents can\u2019t access restricted systems like HR or finance. Treat agents like software \u2014 and red-team them regularly.\nFinding the Right Partner\nDevelopers, IT, and OT leaders in industries like retail who partner with AI providers and design agentic AI with security and governance from day one will lead \u2014 not just in innovation, but in trust and resilience.\nSeek out AI partners who can provide industry trained ready-to-use AI agents to deliver faster return on investment, and the scope to develop and add more agents with the AI platform and tooling for creating, deploying, and maintaining agentic solution components across a product portfolio, enabling easy development of AI applications and solutions.\nPrioritize partners with industry knowledge and a track record working closely with developers to discover what tools will be useful for a full end-to-end AI pipeline. This will support developers and software partners to collect data, train AI models, and deploy across customer devices with an AI software development kit (vision, voice, data, and GenAI) and pre-trained models.\nAnd AI APIs for cloud, hybrid, and edge solutions will provide an easy-to-use ecosystem to integrate into any business application.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builder platforms that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is one of the best web hosting and website builder providers. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough. Built-in features cover everything from appointment booking and email marketing to social posts and eCommerce setup. It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI Notes Apps\n1. Jaime\n- What is it: An AI note-taker that records and summarizes meetings without using bots.\n- Ideal for: Founders, managers, sales teams, or recruiters who need instant, structured summaries of meetings\nAI note-taking tools handle tasks like reviewing meetings, creating summaries, or managing action items. Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions. Its AI assistant helps with writing follow-ups, searching across meetings, or drafting ideas post-call. The free plan includes 10 meetings/month. Opt for their paid plans, which begin at \u20ac24/user/month with longer meetings, priority support, and more AI usage.\n2. Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams.

Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords.

Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly.

It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2.

This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4.

It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

      "text": "Best product management software of 2025\nFrom product design to release\nWe list the best product management software, to make it simple and easy to manage everything about your product, from the initial design to final release.\nNote that the software in this list focuses largely on product management, and not project management. Both can often be confused because their boundaries are blurry, and some teams may be able to get away with either type of software. Some obvious project-focused choices have been missed out with the intention of finding the best apps for products, but you can read about the best project management software if that\u2019s more your style.\nCompared with other software categories, product management has clearly been an area to adapt quickly to the AI era following the huge success witnessed by tools like ChatGPT, so it shouldn\u2019t be hard to find an option with a generative AI boost if you fancy some time-saving tech, and the list of apps available with artificial intelligence like GPT is only likely to get longer with time.\nNevertheless, here are the best product management apps available right now, each with their own distinct feature list and targeted audience.\nThe best product management software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest product management software overall\n1. Monday Dev\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe popular project management software company monday.com released its all-encompassing Dev software which is intended to help teams track their release process from start to finish. If you\u2019re already familiar with monday.com design philosophy, getting started with Dev will then be a piece of cake. The UI is very intuitive, with templates to help you and your team get started on the important work immediately. The initial view clearly separates epics, stories, and roadmaps, but you can get granular with your settings if you\u2019re not satisfied with the view out of the box. While tinkering with the view and settings, you will come across its powerful automation, the thing that sets monday.com apart from its competitors, which will take away the dreariness of repetitive tasks.\nWhen it comes to reporting options, dashboards can be customized in such a way as to show the most important data at the outset, with extensive filtering options if you have to show individual or team effort and work breakdown. With the collaboration tools inside the platform, you can ditch tools like Teams or Slack, as you can chat, call, and share documents across the platform easily. Searching for older messages has some room for improvement, but knowing how monday.com improves its software, we can expect these options to catch up to competitors in no time.\nWith Dev you get access to 24/7 support, amazing onboarding documents, forums, chats, and an entire library of self-help articles to get you started and troubleshoot any issues. Be ready to pay for the higher tiers though, as they offer much more automation, integrations, and dashboard combinations.\nRead our full Monday Work Management review.\nBest all-in-one product management software\n2. Craft.io\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCraft.io looks to be a promising app for those wanting to take charge of their product development from start to finish, with tools extending beyond roadmapping and feedback, to strategy building, prioritization, and even capacity planning. You can also visualize multiple products in one view in order to ensure standardization.\nAs a single end-to-end piece of software, it offers features for CPOs, product managers, and product ops, which is important to ensure effective communication. Simplifying the solution also results in some cost saving compared with using different apps for different stages of the product management.\nThe company is big on flexibility, which in clear in the software\u2019s simplicity and ease-of-use, but it\u2019s lacking some of the built-in communication tools that similar project management tools have, making it a hard battle to fight for companies that can get away with using less specialized product-specific software. That said, it\u2019s not short on integrations, with connectivity options for GitHub and GitLab, Miro, Jira, and more.\nThe company\u2019s website also has a shoutout to security, which is a green flag in an area where many companies keep security behind closed doors even if they do have strong measures. It mentions everything form encryption to its Google Cloud data hosting.\nCiting customers like Kimberly-Clark, Cisco Webex, and Quickbase, it\u2019s clearly a well-respected piece of software but we feel that pricing could be more affordable as it battles other types of software relating to projects, too. Still, there are healthy discounts for paying annually.\nBest product management software for AI\n3. Airfocus\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf \u20182020s\u2019 were an adjective, then Airfocus would be very \u20182020s\u2019, because the icon-filled, neatly designed, clear interface makes it very easy to use and a reason to choose the app in itself. By nature, it\u2019s much more than a product management platform because it can handle communications and even has a built-in AI assistant to help speed up some processes.\nBeing such a collaborative app, users can set up a custom branded portal for engaging with their community, including investors and customers, in order to collect insights and share ideas.\nThe roadmapping makes it easy to visualize progress, along with visions and goals, while the strategy management portion can handle things like risks and adjustments.\nArguably worthy of the biggest mention is its so-called AI Assist, which was introduced in beta early in 2023 ahead of a wider rollout. It works thanks to a collaboration with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and it can be used in a number of text-related scenarios to create and edit text: things like writing a user story, writing a release note, brainstorming ideas, improving existing writing, checking for spelling and grammar mistakes, translating, and adjusting language to be less or more technical. While AI continues to be a growing trend, very few product management apps have used it to their customers\u2019 benefits yet, so Airfocus gets a big gold star for this.\nPricing ranges from affordable to not-so-affordable, so there are options for most types of businesses, and paying annually will save you two months\u2019 worth of payments.\nBest product management software for development\n4. Productboard\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThis is an app that promises to \u201cget products to market, faster\u201d by understanding what customers need and aligning everyone around your roadmap. The process has a notable emphasis on feedback which helps link facts and figures with feelings and emotions to create a more rounded approach to product development, all under one roof. This can include surveys, interviews, and social media feedback.\nIts emphasis on feedback combined with its other features means that Productboard is a powerful tool for strategizing, helping teams to understand users and markets and to identify advantages and disadvantages. This all ties into analytics to make it easy to get a quick overview.\nSome of the firm\u2019s customers include Zoom, Salesforce, and Avast, which gives prospective customers an indication of how it could be used and how valued it is. Some of its customers also act as integrations for Productboard users, plus others like Slack, Intercom, Zapier, and Miro. There are also some APIs available and an option to submit requests for more integrations which the team promises to at least consider.\nProductboard\u2019s commitment to security is evident, given its entire page dedicated to the matter. You can read about things like encryption, its AWS data hosting, and compliance, as well as features that you can enable as a user for a security boost like SSO and IP whitelisting. Pricing for the Essentials package is attractive, but the Pro plan looks expensive in comparison, though it does present more possibilities. A pair of higher-level tiers require a customized quote, or you can pick the free Starter plan which is very limited but can be great for startups and SMBs with limited budgets.\nBest product management software for collaboration\n5. ProductPlan\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nA product\u2019s journey is ProductPlan\u2019s clear intention with this software, which has powerful visual roadmapping functionalities available in a multitude of views designed for specific cases, like marketing and sales, or engineering. When working on multiple products, or you\u2019re at different stages of development, you can use ProductPlan to prioritize workload and designate accountable workers.\nIn terms of collaboration, the built-in commenting feature helps to keep conversations linked to specific tasks rather than thrown into a catch-all Slack channel, but you can still @mention people if you need certain colleagues to be notified more abruptly.\nWhile the list of integrations isn\u2019t as extensive as others, the hand-picked third parties are all very useful to product development. Expect ProductPlan to work with GitHub, Trello, Jira, Zapier, and a few others.\nPricing is reasonable, but there are cheaper alternatives from other companies if you don\u2019t need all of the features. The Basic plan has just about everything most smaller companies need, while Professional is more geared toward larger enterprises. There\u2019s also a more customizable Enterprise tier, too. A lack of lower-end free or budget tiers is a weakness of ProductPlan, and only the Basic plan is available as a trial. For the more expensive plans, you\u2019ll need to get in touch to request a live demo, which is a bit more hassle.\nBest product management software for customization\n6. ProdPad\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile some product management apps mirror wider project management software in terms of usability and layout, ProdPad may take a little more effort for unfamiliar users to become familiar with the app. The way it lays things out may be different to others, but all the familiar tools are there.\nThe priority chart is especially useful for visualizing the impact of an idea compared with the effort required, helping companies to identify quick wins and other valuable projects. Taking a step back, you can also check an overview of your company\u2019s entire product portfolio to make sure that the update cycle is happening as it should be.\nProdPad is another app to be an early adopter of artificial intelligence, and its GPT-powered assistant promises to do the work of five product managers. Users can free up time by having the AI write up ideas, surface themes in feedback, and automatically link feedback to ideas.It uses GPT-3 at the moment, but given the company\u2019s commitment to AI it\u2019s likely to adapt as generative AI continues to improve.\nPricing is highly customizable, but opt for everything and you could spend a pretty fortune. On top of the core list of features, you\u2019ll either need to pick an Essentials or Advanced version of Idea, Feedback, or Roadmaps. Go for any version of two, or all three, of the plans, and you can spend over $100 per person per month. That\u2019s for editors, but an unlimited number of reviewers is free. Sign up annually and you\u2019ll save 20% compared with a monthly subscription.\nBest product management software FAQs\nWhat is product management tool?\nThe best product management tools are basically a Swiss Army knife for teams creating products. It helps with planning, tracking progress, managing tasks, and keeping everyone in the loop. It can be a lifesaver in staying organized and efficient. The best product management tools incorporate a range of external factors to help with development, not least feedback from testing for improvements, while also communicating effectively with colleagues.\nHow we tested the best product management software\nTo test for the best product management apps we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service.

      "text": "Best ERP software of 2025\nEnterprise Resource Planning made easy\nWe list the best ERP software, to make it simple and easy to better manage inventory and sales cycles from a single and reliable platform.\nOne rule to note is that there is a software tool for virtually every need, whether individual or enterprise needs. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is one of the areas where software helps a lot.\nERP refers to managing important business processes such as payroll, invoices, purchase orders, bill payments, etc. It\u2019s difficult to do this manually, especially for large businesses, which is where ERP software helps.\nAn ERP software can be cloud-based or hosted on-premise. Cloud-based systems are more convenient because you can spin them up and use them from anywhere. On-premise means hosting the software on your own servers, which some companies do for more security and control over their data.\nCloud-based ERP software makes it easy to manage your business's day-to-day operations. It\u2019s more beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses lacking the resources to buy and maintain their own servers. You give up some control over your data by using a cloud-based tool, but we think the convenience, potential cost savings, and scalability outweigh this disadvantage.\nWe tested different cloud-based ERP software to identify the best ones. We identified the best ones based on important factors including pricing, customer support, ease of use, performance, etc.\nWe've also featured the best product information management software.\nThe best ERP software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest ERP software for large companies\n1. SAP ERP\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSAP is Germany\u2019s biggest software company, and its tools are very popular within Europe and abroad. The company's ERP software is aptly named SAP ERP. It offers a lot of features that help businesses manage their operations effectively.\nSAP ERP has a lot of functions spread across human resources, finance, sales, procurement, supply chain management, etc. The human resource tool enables you to store all needed data about your employees and manage them effectively from a centralized database. The finance tool enables you to monitor all your financial transactions and extract insights.\nAs for supply chain management, SAP ERP helps you to place and ship orders and track their deliveries. It also simplifies sending and receiving invoices for your business. This platform allows you to gather data about your customers and access it from one centralized database, i.e., customer relationship management.\nGiven the expansive data you feed into it, it\u2019s fitting that SAP ERP can help you analyze that data to extract business insights.\nA major drawback of SAP ERP is that it has a complex user interface that non-technical people might find difficult to navigate. Likewise, integrating it with third-party apps isn\u2019t straightforward, so you may need to hire an experienced engineer to help you, and they don\u2019t come cheap.\nBest ERP software for Microsoft users\n2. Microsoft Dynamics 365\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nVirtually everyone knows Microsoft, the tech giant behind the Windows operating system. It offers numerous other software tools, including the Dynamics 365 ERP.\nDynamics 365 offers many functions cutting across sales and marketing, finance, supply chain management, and customer service.\nYou can gather data about customers and access it from a centralized database; this makes it easy to retrieve data when you want to build up customer relationships. The data also helps you identify your customer\u2019s needs to fulfill them.\nYou can manage your supply chain on Dynamics 365. The platform makes it easy to place orders and track them up until delivery. You can keep track of your inventory to know what you need to restock or not.\nRegarding finance, Dynamics 365 enables you to manage your accounting and invoicing and extract insights from your business metrics.\nThis platform has so many features that it\u2019s known for having a steep learning curve. It\u2019s also pretty expensive, starting at $50 per user per month.\nBest ERP software for manufacturing\n3. Katana MRP\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKatana is an ERP tool designed for businesses that manufacture their products. It enables you to manage your supply chain starting from the raw materials up to the finished product.\nKatana offers real-time inventory management to help you stay on top of your supply chain. You'll always know what amount of raw materials you possess and which ones you need to reorder. It also offers real-time master planning to help you manage your production and scheduling.\nKatana integrates with QuickBooks and Xero, two popular accounting tools, so you can use them to stay on top of your finances.\nKatana has a simple pricing structure. You can choose from one of three plans, with the Essential Plan as best for small businesses. You can use the 14-day free trial to test Katana\u2019s features before making your final purchase decision.\nBest ERP software for finance\n4. AccountMate\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAccountMate is focused on the financial and accounting management parts of enterprise resource planning. It helps businesses manage their finances accurately.\nYou can use AccountMate's accounts payable feature to monitor every payment you need to make and avoid any late payments or duplicate invoices. You can use the accounts receivable (A/R) module to monitor your sales and ensure you receive payments when due.\nYou can also use the general ledger (GL) module, which lets you do many things, including generating financial reports from your sales data to present to domestic or foreign tax authorities. There's also the contact manager module that enables you to connect to Microsoft Office products and manage customer relationships.\nAccountMate is known for having a cluttered user interface that you may find difficult to navigate. It also doesn\u2019t offer much outside financial management in the ERP cycle. However, it\u2019s good at what it specializes in.\nBest ERP software for scalability\n5. Wrike\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWrike is a broad business management software with many features. It offers a cloud-based resource management platform that makes it easier to run your business.\nWrike offers many collaborative features, so it's easy to keep your staff on the same page. You can assign tasks to each of them and set deadlines, and everyone can see their respective tasks and the required contribution from others to meet business goals.\nWith Wrike, you can visualize all your business projects in a way that's easy to understand. You can extract insights from your business and financial data to identify what needs improvements or not.\nWrike offers integrations with over 400 software tools ranging from Salesforce for customer relationship management to Zoom for video conferencing, OneDrive for cloud storage, Jira for task tracking, etc. This platform is very customizable, thanks to these integrations that add extra functionality.\nWrike is a very broad platform with a steep learning curve. It may feel overwhelming at first because of the numerous features, but you can get used to it with time.\nWe've also featured the best GPS fleet tracking solutions.\nBest ERP software FAQs\nWhat are the essential features of ERP Software?\n1. Accounting\nThe platform should enable you to automate accounting-related tasks such as payroll, invoicing, and financial reporting. Automation reduces the time your staff spends on accounting processes and frees up time for other areas. Automation also brings about lesser errors compared to humans when working with figures.\n2. Data Analytics\nAn ERP software collects data from different business divisions and sources. Hence, you should be able to analyze that information using the software. What is our revenue growth (or fall) over a specific period? How many customers did we add? By what percentage have payroll costs increased? Etc.\n3. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)\nAn ERP should have features that help you manage relationships with customers. For instance, you should be able to store customer information such as contact details and order history and retrieve the information whenever you want. Your ERP should also integrate with your dedicated CRM tools such as Salesforce and Pipedrive.\n4. Human Resource (HR) Management\nThe platform should allow you to manage human resource-related functions such as managing recruitment, hiring, and onboarding. It should be able to automate some complex HR-related functions such as tax withholding and deductions.\nHow to choose ERP software\n1. Budget\nBudget is the first criterion to consider when choosing any software. How much can you afford to spend on ERP software? The good thing is that you can find a sufficient tool for any price range, though features may differ.\nMost businesses use the same ERP system for years or even decades, so consider if you can afford your desired platform in the long term.\n2. Third-Party Integration\nEvery ERP software must have integrations with other business software tools. Your ERP tool can\u2019t do all the work; you\u2019ll need to import data from other platforms, e.g., importing financial records from your accounting software. Ensure that your desired ERP software has sufficient third-party integration that\u2019ll help you manage business processes.\n3. Customer Support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll likely need external support to help solve your problem. Ensure your ERP software offers good support resources such as extensive documentation, how-tos, FAQs, video tutorials, etc. You should also be able to contact a human support representative if need be.\n4. Scalability\nThe platform should work well even as your business grows alongside its data needs. The good thing is that cloud-based platforms are built to scale efficiently.\nHow we tested the best ERP software\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best email marketing service of 2025\nMake your emails work harder\nWe list the best email marketing services, to make it simple and easy to manage one or more email marketing campaigns.\nThe best email marketing software streamlines extending your permission marketing to the targeted audience. Email marketing remains a crucially important part of permission marketing, which deals with the proper targeting of users who have previously opted-in for receipt of such emails.\nLong gone are the days of harvesting emails from websites, and in fact anyone attempting that bygone practice faces not just legal consequences, but also consumer backlash and brand damage.\nAccording to marketing professional Eric Harbison, \"If social media is the cocktail party, then email marketing is the \u2018meet up for coffee\u2019. The original 1 to 1 channel.\" It may not be the most flashy way of getting your message out there - but it is essential nonetheless. And so are the right email marketing tools.\nThere are plenty of good reasons why when running an online marketing campaign, it should be properly handled, to realistically increase the chances for consumer engagement and ultimately improve sales conversions.\nReader offer: Get 20% off on Omnisend\nOmnisend is an email marketing software ideal for e-commerce business owners. With Omnisend you can create email campaigns, send personalized SMS messages to customers, and send pop-up notifications on web browsers. Try Omnisend today with the code TECHRADAR20 and get 20% off.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nHowever, having the right email marketing software can be the difference between a single-digit and double-digit response - essentially the difference between a success, and a miss - so it's important to get it right. It really doesn't matter which type of email client or email provider you use, as you will generally generate and send emails through the email marketing software itself.\nFurthermore, email marketing does not live in isolation, and is just a single part of the overall marketing process. Therefore, you also need to ensure the other pieces are in place: good landing pages, lead generation tools, and any relevant sales tools. This applies either in the case of if you're selling your own products/services, or running an affiliate marketing campaign to sell other folk\u2019s products. .\nWe've compared these email marketing software solutions on various aspects, from their features and interface to their customer support and documentation quality. We also dived into their analytics offerings, personalization, and pricing plans, among other aspects.\nHere then are the best email marketing service providers in the current market. While some services may be more costly than others, some extra features, for example, A/B split-testing, could increase responses enough to make the campaign easily pay for itself.\nWe've also reviewed the best social media management tools and the best mind map software.\nThe best email marketing services of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest email marketing overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEven if you haven\u2019t used email marketing software before, you\u2019ve more than likely heard of MailChimp (perhaps from listening to a sponsored podcast). Launched back in 2001, it has emerged as a leader in this arena, by allowing users to create and send professional marketing emails to their database of customers.\nMailChimp's built-in designer enables editing a selection of templates by adding elements such as clickable text, graphics and logos. But there\u2019s also the option of designing your own email from scratch for those with the requisite coding skills.\nMailChimp excels on the integration front, too, particularly for online retailers. You can link the system up to ecommerce platforms such as Shopify, WooCommerce and Magento for sending targeted product campaigns. After unleashing your campaign, its performance can be analyzed through the report feature.\nThe software offers a free tier for a single user, which is good for 10,000 emails a month to up to 500 contacts, but it includes the MailChimp logo in the footer. We like that it includes a Creative Assistant and Basic Reporting & Analytics, but only email support and only for the first 30 days may fall short for less experienced users.\nThe paid options start with the Essential package, which allows 5,000 emails monthly, and three users. This plan also includes 24/7 email and chat support, but no phone support. Additional plans furthermore have higher limits along with more features, such as the top tier of plan that includes assistive onboarding, advanced segmentation, a campaign manager, and multivariate testing.\nRead our full MailChimp review.\nBest email marketing service for power users\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nVertical Response has the goal of providing all of the tools you need to ensure your email marketing campaigns succeed. Towards that end, it provides a number of features that include a custom template designer, automation, analytics, and online survey tool options.\nThe designer has an easy-to-use template editor with drag-and-drop and point-and-click functionality. Even if you've no design experience at all, the editor will help you create a beautiful-looking email template with minimal time and effort.\nConvenient automation features include autoresponders and automated emails to respond instantaneously (by email) to customers on each step of their journey, or according to different interactions. This results in the ability to save time and money by making more communications available with minimal effort.\nStrong analytics tools cover all the data basics, including click rates, geolocation, device and browser type. However, going beyond this is the functionality to compare campaign performance, which allows you to get a better idea of the features that work best with your customers.\nAdditionally, along with the analytics are customer landing pages and heatmaps, which allow you to glean useful data on how customers view and interact with your emails.\nThere are only two tiers available: Basic and Pro. The price for Basic starts at a low $11/month, but realize that this is only for a list of under 500 contacts, and it doubles to take it up to 1,000 contacts. There is no free tier, which is a shortcoming, but there is the option of a Pay As You Go option for low volume users, or those that need only occasional use. There is a free trial available as well.\nWe like that it includes live customer support, an unlimited number of emails, automated follow-up emails, and the option to remove VerticalResponse branding. The Pro plan increases the cost to $16/month, and adds advanced reporting, a delivery rate review option, and A/B subject line testing. Both plans miss the mark with no SMS messaging, and also direct support has the single option of a support portal, without a phone or email option, although self-help options look well developed including video tutorials.\nRead our full Vertical Response review.\nBest budget-friendly email marketing software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFormerly known as Sendinblue, Brevo is aimed for small to medium-sized businesses, and is one of the most affordable options out there. The easy-to-use platform offers most things a marketer might need, including email marketing, CRM features, and automation tools.\nOne of the first positive things to notice about Brevo is the interface. It\u2019s simple to use, and signing up is fast and takes no longer than a few moments. The email editor simplifies email campaign creation with features like drag-and-drop, making it a great choice for less tech-savvy users. Beginners can find helpful materials like tutorials, blogs, and webinars, providing clear instructions to fully utilize the platform.\nBrevo offers over 60 professional templates that can be changed to match your specific idea and look. Layouts, visuals, and text are all customizable, and engagement can be improved by including personalized data such as recipients' names and locations.\nOccasionally you could experience lag or tricky data imports that could disrupt the overall experience.\nThe platform absolutely rocks when it comes to automation, though. To simplify managing multiple campaigns, users can create workflows that respond to triggers like sign-ups, purchases, or website visits. In other words, Brevo automates repetitive tasks and enables targeted outreach to a large audience.\nOverall, Brevo is a very affordable platform that offers four plans, and uses a flexible pricing model that charges based on emails sent, not the number of contacts. Among those four plans is a free plan as well, which gives 300 emails per day with up to 100,000 contacts, but includes Brevo branding. The three other plans are Starter, Business and Enterprise.\nThe Starter plan is priced at $9 per month, offering 5000 emails per month with no daily sending limit. For an extra fee you can remove the branding. The Business plan starts at $18 per month and adds more features such as marketing automation, A/B testing, advanced analytics, phone support, and more. You\u2019ll need to request a quote for the Enterprise plan which gives unlimited contacts and a whole lot of other goodies. All plans, except for the Free plan also include 24/7 email support.\nRead our full Brevo review.\nBest email marketing service for e-commerce\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOmnisend is a platform for e-commerce business owners to market to their customers. You can use it to send bulk messages via email or SMS to entice subscribers to buy your product. This platform with almost a decade of experience serves over 80,000 customers worldwide, such as Hallmark, and employs over 180 people at three offices.\nOmnisend has a free plan, but with limited features; it supports reaching out to a maximum of 250 contacts via a maximum of a generous 500 emails and or more paltry 60 SMS messages a month. It also includes 24/7 support via email and chat, professional email templates, and sales and performance reports.\nHowever, be aware that you\u2019ll need to pay for a premium plan to get the best from this platform.\nOmnisend offers two premium plans; Standard and Pro. The lower-tier Standard plan starts at $16 / \u00a316 / AUD$24 per month for up to 500 contacts and the higher-tier Pro plan starts at $59 / \u00a359 / AUD$89 per month for up to 2,500 contacts. The price then increases depending on the number of contacts. For example, up to 5,000 contacts cost $65 per month on the Standard plan, and $90 per month on the Pro plan. You can also opt for sending only SMS messages and pay a fixed price per message, which varies for different countries. There is also a no credit card info required to access the free trial available for these tiers.\nIf you own an online store and want to market products to existing customers or potential customers as easily as possible, Omnisend is an ideal tool. You can create different types of campaigns and send them using email, SMS, or push notifications. Afterward, you can get detailed reports to monitor the performance of your campaigns and make adjustments where needed.\nOmnisend has a simple user interface, but we think that it could use some more interactivity. Likewise, the campaign creation and editing tool can be difficult to handle for new users. We also think that the Help Center is well done, but while there are email and chat options for direct support, we find the lack of a phone number for direct support a significant omission on the paid plan tiers.\nRead our full Omnisend review.\nBest email marketing service for chat\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGetResponse is a marketing platform that includes a chat platform as standard. This means that GetResponse could be an ideal solution for marketers and business users in general, covering everything from customer relations management to landing pages and webinars.\nUnderlying all this, though, is the marketing platform that provides landing pages, and email marketing, along with a respectable amount of automation, to help ensure that your communications and marketing are working well. So after a chat with customers or colleagues via a link in an email or even a chat button on a landing page, you can follow up automatically with emails for responses and even upsell as required.\nAs if that wasn't enough, there are also plenty of great integrations available with other popular third-party platforms, including SalesForce, Slack, WordPress, and Facebook, along with a number of ecommerce platforms and payment gateways options such as Magento, Shopify, Etsy, Stripe, and PayPal.\nWhile the Free tier has only 500 contacts, the cheapest paid tier for GetResponse allows for up to 1,000 subscribers- and grows with your needs up to 100,000. For more subscribers, the price then rises according to the number of people you need to reach. At any level of tier, even Free, there is an unlimited generous monthly number of email sends supported.\nTo get the chat functionality, along with support via email and chat, a paid tier of subscription is a requirement. The Free tier is not all barebones we would point out in fairness, as it has predesigned templates, custom HTML, a visual email editor, and a spam check, but be aware that is limited to a single user. Above the free tier, there is a choice of four tiers of plans, including the top plan that can be customized for specific needs. Even the lower-priced tiers add neat features including birthday emails, contact tagging, visited URL automation, and split automation. The user limits on the lower tiers may be too restrictive for some.\nPayments are made monthly for the paid plans. There are discounts available for prepaying annually, 18%, and also for paying 24 months at a time for a discount of 30%.\nHowever, realize that phone support, and also SMS marketing, is reserved for the highest custom tier. Lower tiers have access to a well-developed support center, email support in eight languages, and 24/7 live chat support.\nWhile costs may appear somewhat steep in comparison to other providers, be aware that this presumes a single main user and is charged only to that, rather than all users being charged on a monthly basis as some other providers do, making it potentially more price competitive depending on the number of users on the plan. Furthermore, the inclusion of other marketing tools makes this a potentially powerful platform for users that can leverage these functions.\nRead our full GetResponse review.\nBest email marketing service for growing businesses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nConstant Contact offers a powerful suite of tools for email marketing purposes. Putting together an email is painless using drag and drop tools for the creation of visually-rich emails. Contact lists of senders can be imported from a range of sources, including Outlook, Salesforce, or by uploading a spreadsheet.\nAdditional features are also available, such as email automation and scheduling, with surveys, polls, and dynamic signup forms available for providing feedback. Events can be managed, along with social media right from your account.\nAside from customizable templates and image hosting, analytics underline Constant Contact's service. This makes it easier to measure the effective ROI from campaigns, with the goal of improving conversion rates via different approaches.\nThere are two main plans available, Core and Plus, with the lower tier offering most basic features mentioned here for a nominal monthly price. Unfortunately, the lower tier\u2019s base price only includes up to 500 contacts so be prepared to spend more, but we do like the social media integrations with the likes of Facebook and Twitter. A Plus account costs significantly more, but adds features such as split testing, dynamic content, and the ability to offer mobile-responsive coupons.\nThere is a 30-day guarantee, which is second best to a free trial as it does require creating an account and providing a credit card, and then canceling for a refund. We are also disappointed that adding SMS message marketing for up to 500 messages costs the same monthly as the basic plan, and is not included at least in the upper-tiered plan.\nRead our full Constant Contact review.\nBest email marketing service for Zoho users\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZoho Campaigns is the email marketing platform from Zoho, a company providing a wide range of software, including their office suite, CRM, and IT helpdesk.\nZoho Campaigns, a part of the sales and marketing suite of services, is a mature permission marketing tool that targets better communications and conversions.\nValuable features include the wide range of visually appealing pre-built newsletter templates which covers the gamut from seasonal events to Black Friday sales.\nEmail workflows, another highlight, enable using a simple drag-and-drop interface to set up automated actions and events makes handling large campaigns a lot easier. We also like that the top tier offers advanced segmentation, dynamic content, batch sending and email polls and attachments.\nAs you'd expect, Zoho Campaigns integrates seamlessly into existing Zoho products, not least of which is Zoho CRM. But there are also numerous third-party integrations available, including G Suite, SurveyMonkey, Facebook, YouTube, and WordPress.\nPricing is relatively inexpensive, and there's even a Forever Free plan that allows you to send up to 6,000 emails a month to up to 2,000 subscribers. While we appreciate the free trial, without a credit card requirement, we are disappointed that it is a relatively short 14 days. Furthermore, we find that SMS marketing requires an add on package even on the paid tiers.\nRead our full Zoho Campaigns review.\nBest email marketing service for small business\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNeo is an all-in-one email and growth suite geared towards small businesses and entrepreneurs, providing everything you need to grow online - minus the fuss. With over 30,000 businesses trusting Neo, this platform shines in the small business market. Starting at just $1.99 and going up to $7.99 per mailbox per month (billed yearly), Neo has options that fit different budgets and business needs.\nAs soon as you sign up with Neo, you\u2019ll get a custom business email address that matches your brand name (think yourname@yourcompany.co.site). This will boost your credibility while building trust with clients. Plus, it helps you pick the right domain name if you need one. But there\u2019s more - Neo provides a simple one-page site to strengthen your digital presence, requiring no setup or coding skills.\nOn the downside, while Neo is a superb choice for small businesses, we must note that the features you receive will depend on your chosen subscription. For example, the \"Starter\" plan has just 10GB of mailbox storage, less than the 15GB free tier for personal Gmail accounts. This can fill up fast, so if your small business has grand plans, consider upgrading to the \"Standard\" plan with 50GB or the \"Max\" plan with 100GB of cloud storage.\nStill, all plans include mobile apps for Android and iOS, a built-in calendar, and access to your Neo inbox via third-party platforms. The \u201cStandard\u201d plan offers additional perks like a priority inbox and read receipts, while the \u201cMax\u201d plan unlocks advanced features such as campaign mode for email marketing and the AI Smart Write feature. Each plan is packed with essential tools, including webmail, integrated calendar and contacts apps, email marketing tools, appointment scheduling, and an awesome AI email assistant.\nThis AI-powered tool helps you generate polished emails in no time, whether you need a quick reply or a more detailed response. It\u2019s built to make communication effortless, so you can focus on growing your business.\nThe customer support experience could be better - useful how-tos aside, tickets take time. But Neo certainly doesn't cut corners when it comes to security. With strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and full GDPR compliance, Neo keeps your data safe and your privacy secure.\nAll in all, Neo is perfect for small businesses and startups looking for a beginner-friendly email suite. It includes built-in marketing tools, an email signature designer, and tracking features to create effective campaigns without external services. Budget-friendly and easy to use, Neo is great for boosting growth and productivity - just keep in mind it might not be enough if your business snowballs.\nRead our full Neo email review.\nBest email marketing service for customization\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe can\u2019t talk about marketing software without mentioning HubSpot. The marketing powerhouse has many features and services, including plenty of email marketing tools. What\u2019s more, some of them are free.\nFor email creation and design, you get a drag-and-drop editor, pre-built email templates, and AI-powered content generation. The editor is intuitive and easy to use, perfect for someone with no coding knowledge. You can add images, text, dividers, buttons, and other things with zero fuss.\nYou can also just pick one of many templates (only 3 available for free), which are designed to be suited for various purposes such as newsletters, promotions, announcements, and so on. They are all mobile-responsive, too.\nGenerative AI will help you write subject lines, improve email copies, or generate full drafts based on a single prompt.\nA part of HubSpot\u2019s email marketing tools is also automation. You can send a series of timed, automated emails based on what you need. Just as an example, this can range from welcome emails for new subscribers to re-engagement emails for inactive contacts.\nA/B testing is available as well, email tracking, and the option to analyze the engagement data to predict the best time to send an email to each individual contact.\nIt would probably take too long to list each feature individually, but HubSpot\u2019s CRM-powered personalization is a great choice for more effective audience targeting and improved contact engagement.\nAs mentioned, not all of these tools are free, and the starting plan is priced at $9 per month per seat when choosing annual billing. The automation isn\u2019t free and is included in this plan. Additionally, the plan includes email and in-app chat support, and further benefits like more marketing contacts and email templates.\nRead our full HubSpot review.\nHonorable mentions\nConvertKit is another intriguing platform that's more of an integrated solution when it comes to promoting ideas and content. It has as much emphasis on providing custom landing pages as an integral part of your website, as it does for the marketing side of email newsletters and lists. Better still is that there is a perfectly functional free tier available to use that supports up to 300 subscribers and includes unlimited landing pages, unlimited forms, audience tagging and segmentation, but only community support.\nSendinblue provides a really extensive digital marketing platform which not only offers email marketing and landing pages, but also SMS and chat- all built into a wider CRM that allows for segmentation and direct advertising integrations for social media. If you think it sounds too good to be true, there's a free tier with unlimited contacts, and up to 300 emails daily available with a drag and drop editor, WhatsApp and SMS campaigns to take for a test spin.\nActiveCampaign is yet another option aiming to provide an integrated marketing and communications platform with a CRM. Automation is front and center with this software, as it does site tracking, integrated forms, and advanced reporting. With all paid tiers, it smartly includes 24/7 support via both chat and email. We also like the inline forms, the site and event tracking, API and webhooks on the lowest tier. Take it up further to the Professional tier to take advantage of the five user plan with Salesforce integration, Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration, predictive sending and attribution reporting to take any campaign to the next level.\niContact goes for more of a dedicated email marketing platform than some of the others above. It focuses on features for email design, along with a whole range of A/B testing options for subject line, content, and incentives, allowing you to optimize your campaign as it proceeds. Pricing is more expensive than some of the other alternatives in the segment, but the split testing option is a killer app that can prove invaluable at times. There is a free tier limited to 250 contacts, and then a single Advanced tier with pricing varying based on the number of contacts, which starts at 750 for $14/month.\nWe've also reviewed the best WordPress themes for blogs.\nBest email marketing service FAQs\nWhich email marketing service is right for you?\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Price | Support options |\nOmnisend | Starting from $16 a month | Email, live chat |\nGetResponse | Free plan available | Email, live chat |\nConstant Contact | Starting from $9.99 a month | Email, live chat, telephone |\nNeo email | $1.99 per mailbox, per month.

If you only plan to send basic emails to small groups of subscribers, then a free plan should be fine.

If you lack experience with email marketing software, you'll want to opt for applications that come with solid support and helpful tutorials and documentation. Not all software programs offer phone or 24/7 support, so you'll want to check this before committing to one.\nLastly, look out for the software's third-party and social media integrations, personalization options, email limits, and pricing.\nHow we tested the best email marketing service\nWe've tested the best email marketing software across numerous points, starting with the features they offer and what type of user they'd be best suited for.
