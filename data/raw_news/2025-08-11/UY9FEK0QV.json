  "title": "Why Niger is investigating the $5-million sale of the largest Mars rock found on Earth",
  "description": "The 54-pound meteorite from Mars was discovered in the Sahara in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023.",
  "content": "A Martian meteorite, said to be the largest piece of Mars on Earth, at Sotheby\u2019s in New York in July. It recently sold for just over $5 million at an auction of rare geological and archaeological objects.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth \u2014 a 54-pound meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record.\n\nBut in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible \u201cillicit international trafficking,\u201d claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute:\n\nHow it was found\n\nSotheby\u2019s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles to Earth.\n\nIt was discovered in the Sahara in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, according to the auction house. His identity was not disclosed. Nor was the identity of the buyer last month.\n\nMeteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.\n\nHunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.\n\nAccording to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private gallery in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.\n\nThe meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction.\n\nFollowing the sale, Niger raised questions about how the meteorite came to be sold at auction.\n\nNiger\u2019s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite\u2019s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was \u201cakin to illicit international trafficking.\u201d\n\nLast week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of \u201cprecious stones, semi-precious stones and meteorites nationwide\u201d in an effort to ensure their traceability.\n\nSotheby\u2019s said in a statement sent to the Associated Press that the meteorite was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.\n\n\u201cAs with everything we sell, all necessary documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved,\u201d the statement read.\n\nAuthorities in Niger did not respond to AP questions.\n\nWhile global agreements are in place to regulate the trade of cultural artifacts, there is ambiguity about whether meteorites are covered.\n\nPatty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property \u2014 which Niger and the U.S. have ratified \u2014 meteorites can qualify as cultural property.\n\nHowever, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,\u201d she told the AP.\n\nSome countries, like Morocco, one of the leading sources of meteorites on the international market, require restitution if the objects are discovered on their territory. But enforcement has been challenging due to the vast desert areas and informal trading networks.\n\nBanchereau writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "NASA spacecraft begins 2-year trip home with asteroid rubble\n- Share via\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 With rubble from an asteroid tucked inside, a NASA spacecraft fired its engines and began the long journey back to Earth on Monday, leaving the ancient space rock in its rearview mirror.\nThe trip home for OSIRIS-REx, the robotic prospector, will take two years.\nOSIRIS-REx reached asteroid Bennu in 2018 and spent two years flying near and around it, before collecting rubble from the surface last fall.\nDante Lauretta, the mission\u2019s principal scientist based at the University of Arizona, estimates the spacecraft holds between one-half and a full pound of mostly bite-size chunks. Either way, it easily exceeds the target of at least 2 ounces.\nIt will be the biggest cosmic haul for the U.S. since the Apollo mission retrieved moon rocks. While NASA has returned comet dust and solar wind samples, this is the first time it\u2019s gone after pieces of an asteroid. Japan has accomplished it twice, but in tiny amounts.\nA NASA spacecraft descended to an asteroid Tuesday and momentarily touched the surface to collect a handful of cosmic rubble that will be brought to Earth.\nScientists described Monday\u2019s departure from Bennu\u2019s neighborhood as bittersweet.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on getting a sample back from an asteroid since my daughter was in diapers and now she\u2019s graduating from high school, so it\u2019s been a long journey,\u201d said NASA project scientist Jason Dworkin.\nAdded Lauretta: \u201cWe have gotten used to being at Bennu and seeing new and exciting images and data coming back to us here on Earth.\u201d\nOSIRIS-REx was already nearly 200 miles from the solar-orbiting Bennu when it fired its main engines Monday afternoon for a fast, clean get-away.\nColorado-based flight controllers for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin applauded when confirmation arrived of the spacecraft\u2019s departure: \u201cWe\u2019re bringing the samples home!\u201d\nScientists hope to uncover some of the solar system\u2019s secrets from the samples vacuumed last October from Bennu\u2019s dark, rough, carbon-rich surface. The asteroid is an estimated 1,600 feet wide and 4.5 billion years old.\nNASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft crushed rocks and sent rubble flying as it briefly touched an asteroid, a strong indication that it had succeeded in collecting samples.\nBennu \u2014 considered a broken chunk from a bigger asteroid \u2014 is believed to hold the preserved building blocks of the solar system. The returning pieces could shed light on how the planets formed and how life arose on Earth. They also could improve Earth\u2019s odds against any incoming rocks.\nAlthough the asteroid is 178 million miles away, OSIRIS-REx will put another 1.4 billion miles on its odometer to catch up with Earth.\nThe SUV-size spacecraft will circle the sun twice before delivering its small sample capsule to Utah\u2019s desert floor on Sept. 24, 2023. That will end the more than $800-million mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral in 2016.\nThe precious samples will be housed at a new lab under construction at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center. The Houston facility is already home to hundreds of pounds of lunar material collected by the 12 Apollo moonwalkers from 1969-72.\nScientists initially thought the spacecraft had stored 2 pounds of asteroid rubble, but then revised their estimate downward. They won\u2019t know for certain how much is on board until the capsule is opened after touchdown.\n\u201cEvery bit of sample is valuable,\u201d Dworkin said. \u201cWe have to be patient.\u201d\nNASA\u2019s experimental Mars helicopter rises from the dusty red surface into the planet\u2019s thin air, achieving the first powered flight on another planet.\nNASA has more asteroid projects planned.\nSet to launch in October, a spacecraft named Lucy will fly past swarms of asteroids out near Jupiter, while a spacecraft known as Dart will blast off in November in an attempt to redirect an asteroid as part of a planetary protection test. Then in 2022, the Psyche spacecraft will take off for an odd, metallic asteroid bearing the same name.\nNone of these missions, however, involve sample return."

Team members analyzed data and pictures before declaring success.\nPerseverance arrived in February at Mars\u2019 Jezero Crater \u2014 believed to be the home of a lush lakebed and river delta billions of years ago \u2014 in search of rocks that might hold evidence of ancient life.\nNASA plans to launch more spacecraft to retrieve the samples collected by Perseverance; engineers are hoping to return as many as three dozen samples in about a decade.\n\u201cBe patient, little sample, your journey is about to begin,\u201d Steltzner said."

      "text": "Off the asteroid list: Mystery object orbiting Earth is 54-year-old rocket\n- Share via\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 A mysterious object temporarily orbiting Earth is a 54-year-old rocket and not an asteroid after all, astronomers confirmed Wednesday.\nObservations by a telescope in Hawaii clinched its identity, according to NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nThe object was classified as an asteroid after its discovery in September. But NASA\u2019s top asteroid expert, Paul Chodas, quickly suspected that it was the Centaur upper rocket stage from Surveyor 2, a failed 1966 moon-landing mission. Size estimates had put it in the range of the old Centaur, which was about 32 feet long and 10 feet in diameter.\nChodas was proven right after a team led by the University of Arizona\u2019s Vishnu Reddy used an infrared telescope in Hawaii to observe not only the mystery object but also a Centaur from 1971 still orbiting Earth. The data from the images matched.\n\u201cToday\u2019s news was super gratifying!\u201d Chodas said via email. \u201cIt was teamwork that wrapped up this puzzle.\u201d\nThe object formally known as 2020 SO entered a wide, lopsided orbit around Earth last month and made its closest approach Tuesday at slightly more than 31,000 miles from Earth. It will depart the neighborhood in March, shooting back into its own orbit around the sun.\nIts next return is expected in 2036."
