  "title": "As Trump targets cities post-D.C. takeover, he\u2019s only looking for \u2018blue\u2019 crime",
  "description": "Trump\u2019s point isn\u2019t to lend a hand to a local police department to address crime. ",
  "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s take-over of the Washington, D.C., police and the deployment of the National Guard there are political power moves that he made clear on Monday he will not hesitate to use on other cities.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear \u2014 probably on other democratic-leaning cities. Because Trump doesn\u2019t see plain old crime; he sees blue crime, only.\n\nPart of this excessive action is Trump needing to generate a distraction, to turn the focus away from his negative approval ratings, voters\u2019 dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy, his political base\u2019s rebellion over the Jeffrey Epstein case, stubborn inflation and unpopular cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. What\u2019s better than scaring Americans about rampant crime one moment, then purportedly solving it the next?\n\nCertainly, crime has long been an issue in D.C., and the city, in response to large street brawls, has even instituted a teenage curfew. There\u2019s no excuse for the horrendous recent beating of a former federal staffer in an attempted carjacking (two 15-year-old suspects have been arrested in connection with it). But crime rates in D.C., as in most of the U.S., have been trending down since the pandemic, including for violent crimes, which have reached their lowest point in 30 years, the Miami Herald reported.\n\nThe crime situation in the nation\u2019s capital looks complex, not easily explainable by Trump\u2019s hyperbole and fearmongering. While saying the city is suffering from \u201ccrime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t presented any evidence that federal intervention is needed. And he won\u2019t do that the next time he sends the National Guard to another blue city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose our cities over this. And this will go further. We\u2019re starting very strongly with D.C.,\u201d Trump said at a Monday press conference at the White House.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t offer any metrics on what will prompt him to intervene in another city\u2019s policing, the Herald reported. But he suggested what his political calculations will be. On Monday, he focused his ire on blue bastions that didn\u2019t vote for him \u2014 New York, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Oakland and Chicago \u2014 while ignoring the crime rate in red cities like St. Louis and New Orleans.\n\nPerhaps luckily for South Florida, our largest law-enforcement agency, the Miami-Dade Sheriff\u2019s Office, is run by a Republican endorsed by Trump, and the county has done well managing crime. But who\u2019s to say Trump, egged on by Gov. Ron DeSantis, could not find a reason to intervene in some of the region\u2019s Democratic areas, such as Broward County?\n\nTrump\u2019s point isn\u2019t to lend a hand to a local police department to address crime. If it were, he would look for cooperation with local law enforcement, which the D.C. police chief said Monday is nothing new. This move furthers Trump\u2019s narrative that everything is terrible, crime is awful and he\u2019s the only one who can save us. It tramples on home rule, and it keeps making the federal government bigger, not smaller, the opposite of what Republicans and DOGE claim to be doing, with power more concentrated in his hands.\n\nTrump knows that looking tough on crime is good for his brand and bad for Democrats still trying to find their messaging strategy ahead of the 2026 midterms. By constantly shifting the narrative and creating a new controversy almost daily, Trump forces his opponents to keep up. But they would be fools to take the bait each time.\n\nA large section of the American public, meanwhile, feels overwhelmed with the barrage of presidential actions coming from the White House, many choosing to disengage from the political process. All they probably hear are the sound bites and social media headlines that Trump is saving the nation\u2019s capital from \u201cthugs.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Trump probably wants: not to properly solve issues, but to show Americans he\u2019s the new sheriff in town.",
