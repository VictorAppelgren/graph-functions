Generate Key Takeaways\n\nThe Costco beverage aisle is brimming with a variety of coffee, everything from organic blends to big brand bags to cans of cold brew. If you\u2019re a coffee fan, they surely have something for you.\n\nOne of their fan-favorite brew lineups happens to be Costco\u2019s own Kirkland brand. Between bags of their ever-popular Colombian Supremo, French Roast and House Blend Whole Bean Coffees, their Sumatra and Ethiopia organic varieties, and their medium roast and espresso blend bags, their coffee options all have high average ratings on Costco\u2019s website.\n\nWant trending news, op-eds, and top stories straight to your inbox? Sign up for our Daily newsletter.\n\nShoppers also love their mega packs of Kirkland Signature Coffee K-Cup Pods. These 120-count boxes come in 4 varieties - Pacific Bold, Summit Roast, Breakfast Blend and House Decaf. They\u2019re currently $6 off per box, with a sale price of $35.99. They\u2019re each certified organic, fair trade certified, kosher and made from 100% Arabica beans.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with each of these varieties, here is the lowdown, per Costco\u2019s website.\n\u2022 None Pacific Bold is a smoky dark roast with low acidity and heavy body with notes of chocolate.\n\u2022 None Summit Roast is a balanced, yet complex medium roast with notes of stone fruit, dark chocolate and roasted nuts.\n\u2022 None Breakfast Blend is a light roast with toasted walnut and malty brown sugar aroma.\n\u2022 None House Decaf is a decaffeinated medium roast with bright acidity and notes of white fruit and brown sugar.\n\nMost reviewers are smitten with the Kirkland K-Cup varieties. \u201cBetter, smoother flavor than Pike\u2019s Place roast from Starbucks, and obviously way more pods for less money\u201d, stated one reviewer regarding the Summit Roast. \u201cVery good coffee. We were buying Starbucks before and this is going to be a staple in our house\u201d, said another fan.\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend and I started drinking this coffee a few months ago to cut back on buying coffee out and will never go back\u201d, said another in reference to the Breakfast Blend. \u201cKirkland's Breakfast Blend is the perfect balance of smoothness and acidity. My husband and I have been buying it for several years, and it hasn't let us down yet! The price is very good when compared to other coffee pods\u201d, exclaimed another.\n\nAs with most Kirkland products, they stand up against many, if not all, of the name brand versions, and we\u2019re certain their coffee is no exception.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Keurig user and are in the market for refills, this lineup may be for you. The $6 off sale ends August 24, so you may want to stock up soon.\n\nRelated: Costco Just Dropped the Price on This 'Extremely Effective Blender' That Shoppers Say Is 'Great for Smoothies, Shakes and Dressings'\n\nCostco Drops Sale on 4 Varieties of Fan-Favorite Kirkland K-Cup Pods first appeared on Men's Journal on Aug 7, 2025",

      "text": "Costco\u2019s New Smokeless Grill Brings the Backyard Barbeque Indoors\nThe summer season may be winding down, but that doesn\u2019t mean grilling has to. While many people certainly grill outside through autumn, others move most of their cooking indoors. But with this new gadget found at Costco, you can bring the grill with you.\nThat\u2019s right, the Ovente Smokeless Griddle and Grill System means you can grill and smoke all of your favorite foods - burgers, steaks, kabobs - right on your kitchen countertop. According to the manufacturer, its \u201cdouble U-shaped heating tube is designed to minimize smoke\u201d and it contains a \u201cheat-insulation plate that prevents heat from transferring to the outer body of the grill\u201d. All that to say, it doesn\u2019t produce smoke indoors.\nFans enjoy that it heats up fast with adjustable temperature control, and it includes nonstick grill and griddle plates that can be removed for easy cleaning and a drip tray that catches grease, similarly to a Blackstone. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed. It\u2019s compact and easy to use. I made steak and burgers in my kitchen without setting off the smoke alarm\u201d, said one fan.\nFeatured Story: Costco's Fan-Favorite Multi-Cooker That Shoppers Say Is a 'Game-Changer and Time Saver' Is On-Sale Right Now\n\u201cThe smokeless function is impressive, very easy to set up and use. The detachable plates make it super easy to clean\u201d, stated another.\nThe unit is an online only item at Costco and comes in black or cream. It retails for $99.99, and with the $20 off sale, it brings the price down to $79.99. Overall, users are enjoying the results of cooking on this grill. \u201cI wanted a cooker that can handle the smoke and grease that burgers usually produce. Happy so far!\u201d exclaimed another fan.\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a year-round grilling experience, this may just be the ticket. But don\u2019t wait around, the sale ends August 10.\nUp Next:\nCostco\u2019s New Smokeless Grill Brings the Backyard Barbeque Indoors first appeared on Men's Journal on Aug 6, 2025"

Whether it\u2019s a fan-favorite multi-cooker, nonstick cookware set or 14-piece knife set, they have highly-rated, name brand partnerships that members are benefitting from. This latest sale drop features an iconic mini blender brand that, according to fans, is \u2018extremely effective\u2019.\nThe nutribullet Pro Plus Blender features a powerful 1200-watt motor that can puree and blend just about anything, including smoothies, shakes, dressings, dips and sauces. Its small size makes it perfect for single serving recipes, plus it can easily be stored and tucked away in a cabinet when not in use. The pulse control button can be used to make chunkier dips and sauces, such as pesto and chimichurri.\nThis blender is currently on sale at Costco for $30 off, making the price $69.99. The set comes in a sleek black color with the stainless steel base, an extractor blade, 32-ounce cup, 24-ounce cup, 2 flip top to-go lids, 2 cup lip rings and 4 stainless steel straws. It comes suited with a hands-free auto shut-off feature so you can step away while it does the work. Both the cups and blades are top rack dishwasher safe, making clean-up a breeze.\nFeatured Story: Target's Highly-Rated Dual Coffee and Espresso Maker Is $50 Off, and Fans Say It 'Makes Coffee Taste Great'\nUsers seem to be fond of the Pro Plus Blender. \u201cI bought this one to use as my \"travel blender\" for making my smoothies every day. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this little guy is a \"workhorse\". I'm very pleased with the power\u201d, exclaimed one reviewer. \u201cGreat for quick smoothies to take to the gym, easy to clean\u201d, stated another. \u201cThe engine is very powerful and the blades are cutting through ice and frozen fruits and dry fruits like melted butter. The best part is the ease of clean-up. I am very happy with this purchase\u201d, said one happy customer.\nCustomer\u2019s main complaint is that the unit is quite loud while blending, but state the other features make up for it.\nWith its powerful motor, sleek look, ease of use and cleaning and stellar sale price, it seems this mini blender is worth it. Whether you\u2019re upgrading an old nutribullet or purchasing your first one, be sure to head to Costco before the sale ends on August 10.\nUp Next:\nRelated: Costco's New 'So Good' Sparkling Protein Drink Has Shoppers Clearing the Shelves\nCostco Just Dropped the Price on This 'Extremely Effective Blender' That Shoppers Say Is 'Great for Smoothies, Shakes and Dressings' first appeared on Men's Journal on Aug 5, 2025"
