  "title": "'Beyond imagination': Doctors in Gaza alarmed at patients' signs of malnutrition",
  "description": "'The level of hunger is really what\u2019s heartbreaking,' and it's getting worse, said a Texas surgeon visiting Gaza for the third time.",
  "content": "A medical staff member prays last month in a room designated for sterilizing surgical tools, which also serves as a rest and prayer space for doctors and staff, at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.\n\nNot long after Texas surgeon Mohammed Adeel Khaleel arrived at a Gaza City hospital in early August, a 17-year-old was brought in with gunshot wounds to both legs and one hand, sustained when he went to collect food at an aid site.\n\nIn the emergency room, Khaleel said he noted the ribs protruding from the teen\u2019s emaciated torso, an indication of severe malnutrition. When doctors at Al-Ahli Hospital stabilized the patient, he raised his heavily bandaged hand and pointed to his empty mouth, Khaleel said.\n\n\u201cThe level of hunger is really what\u2019s heartbreaking. You know, we saw malnutrition before, back in November, already starting to happen. But now the level is just, it\u2019s beyond imagination,\u201d Khaleel, a spinal surgeon on his third volunteer stint in Gaza, said in an interview.\n\nOn Friday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, the leading authority on global hunger crises, said for the first time that parts of Gaza are in famine and warned that it is spreading. For months, United Nations agencies, aid groups and experts had warned that Israel\u2019s blockade and ongoing offensive were pushing the territory to the brink.\n\nIn the 24 hours following the famine announcement, eight people in Gaza died of malnutrition-related causes, bringing the overall toll of such deaths during the war to 281, including more than 100 children, according Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. A U.S. medical nonprofit working in Gaza says 1 in 6 children under 5 are affected by acute malnutrition.\n\nIsrael rejected the famine announcement, calling it an \u201coutright lie\u201d and pointing to its recent efforts to allow in more food after it eased a complete 2\u00bd-month blockade in May. It has accused Hamas of siphoning off aid \u2014 allegations disputed by the U.N., which says Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order make it extremely difficult to deliver food to the most vulnerable.\n\nKhaleel, who spoke to the Associated Press ahead of the announcement, said the evidence of deprivation was already clear.\n\n\u201cJust the degree of weight loss, post-operative complications and starvation that we\u2019re seeing. That wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if it was called famine,\u201d said Khaleel, who traveled to Gaza as an independent volunteer via the World Health Organization.\n\nAt Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital earlier in the week, nutrition director Dr. Mohammad Kuheil led an AP journalist to the bedside of a thin-limbed girl. Aya Sbeteh, 15, was wounded in an airstrike. But her recovery has been set back by weakness from lack of food that her family says has reduced her weight by more than a third.\n\n\u201cAll we have are grains like lentils, sometimes,\u201d said her father, Yousef Sbeteh, 44. \u201cEven flour is unaffordable.\u201d\n\nThe sick, wounded and young are most vulnerable\n\nAnother patient, Karam Akoumeh, lay with sunken cheeks, his thin skin stretched like plastic wrap across his rib cage. His intestines were seriously damaged when he was shot while going out to collect flour, his family said, compromising his digestive system.\n\nNow he is one of 20 people at Shifa brought in for abdominal wounds and increasingly malnourished because of a shortage of intravenous nutritional supplements, the doctor said.\n\nAkoumeh\u2019s father, Atef, said the lack of supplements compounded the hunger that reduced Karam\u2019s weight from 136 pounds to just 77 pounds.\n\n\u201cI checked throughout all Gaza\u2019s hospitals for it [the supplements], but I have not found any,\u201d he said.\n\nIsraeli officials have pointed out that some of those said to have died from malnutrition had preexisting conditions. But doctors and other experts say that is to be expected, as famine first preys on the most vulnerable, including babies and small children.\n\nSigns of hunger are everywhere\n\nOutside the hospital, the shortage of nutrients is equally dire, doctors and civilians say.\n\n\u201cThere are no protein sources, only plant-based protein from legumes. Meat and chicken are not available. Dairy products are not available, and fruits are also unavailable,\u201d said Kuheil, the doctor in charge of nutrition at Shifa.\n\nIn Gaza City on Friday, Palestinians displaced from elsewhere recounted a desperate search for food.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starving. We eat once a day. Will we be more hungry than we are now? There\u2019s nothing left,\u201d said Dalia Shamali, whose family has been repeatedly displaced from their home in nearby Shijaiyah.\n\nShe said they spent most of their money over the last two years moving from one part of Gaza to another as the Israeli military issued evacuation orders. With Israel allowing more food in recently, the price of flour and other food items has been dropping, but the family still can\u2019t afford them, Shamali said.\n\nIn its announcement Friday, the U.N.-backed IPC said famine in Gaza City is likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and a flood of humanitarian aid.\n\nSome of the IPC\u2019s conclusions were echoed in a report by a group that organizes medical missions to the Gaza Strip, which described a \u201ccatastrophic rise in severe malnutrition\u201d among children and pregnant women.\n\nOne of every six children in Gaza younger than 5 is now affected by acute malnutrition, said the report by U.S. nonprofit MedGlobal, based on observations by its staff in four of Gaza\u2019s five governorates. The group warned that all young children in Gaza are at risk of starving without intervention.\n\nKhaleel, the Texas doctor, said he would leave it to others with more expertise to measure exactly what constitutes famine.\n\nBut he knows what he saw in three weeks of treating patients in Gaza, most of the time at the hospital in Gaza City. Again and again, medical workers cut open patients\u2019 clothing to treat injuries, revealing a loss of muscle and fat caused by hunger that left skin stretched tight over protruding bones.\n\n\u201cThese patients, a number of them that we\u2019re seeing are just exposed ribs, severely skinny extremities,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know that they\u2019re just not getting calories in.\u201d\n\nShurafa and Geller write for the Associated Press and reported from Gaza City and New York, respectively. AP writer Sally Abou AlJoud in Beirut contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Experts warned that Gaza was at risk of famine. Here\u2019s why they confirmed it for Gaza City\n- Share via\nThe Gaza Strip\u2019s largest city is gripped by famine, according to the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Friday that famine was occurring in Gaza City, and is likely to spread to the southern cities of Khan Yunis and Deir al Balah without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nAid groups and food security experts have warned for months that Gaza was on the brink of famine, but this is the first official confirmation.\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the report Friday, calling it \u201cfalse and biased.\u201d The agency, known as COGAT, rejected the claim that there was famine in Gaza and said that significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\nHere\u2019s why:\nThe situation has vastly deteriorated in Gaza\nThe IPC report said that from early July until mid-August it has seen the most severe deterioration since it began analyzing food insecurity and malnutrition in Gaza. And despite the \u201cunprecedented pace\u201d over that time frame, the IPC expects the situation to get worse.\nThese images are part of a series highlighting the suffering of children in Gaza, where a humanitarian disaster is escalating and civilians are starving.\nOne-third of Gaza\u2019s population is expected to experience catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of next month, the IPC said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied there is hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation \u201clies\u201d promoted by Hamas.\nFamine occurs when these conditions are met\nThe IPC was first set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia. It includes more than a dozen U.N. agencies, aid groups, governments and other bodies.\nFamine can appear in pockets, sometimes small ones, and so a formal classification requires caution.\nThe IPC has confirmed famine only a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, and South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and last year in parts of Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region. This is the first confirmed famine in the Middle East.\nIt rates an area as in famine when all three of these conditions are confirmed:\n\u2014 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving.\n\u2014 At least 30% of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition, based on a weight-to-height measurement; or 15% of that age group suffer from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their upper arm.\n\u2014 At least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nGaza\u2019s been a major challenge\nGaza has posed a major challenge for experts because Israel severely limits access to the territory, making it difficult to gather data.\nIn a separate report Friday, the Famine Review Committee, or FRC, said it, too, had concluded there was famine in part of Gaza. The FRC is a group of independent international food security experts regularly consulted by the IPC.\nThe group acts as an added layer of verification when the data show there could be famine.\nThe data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\nIt\u2019s not always clear that hunger is the cause of death\nMost cases of severe malnutrition in children arise through a combination of lack of nutrients along with an infection, leading to diarrhea and other symptoms that cause dehydration, said Alex de Waal, author of \u201cMass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\u201d and executive director of the World Peace Foundation.\n\u201cThere are no standard guidelines for physicians to classify cause of death as \u2018malnutrition\u2019 as opposed to infection,\u201d he said.\nWhen famine occurs, there are often relatively few deaths from hunger alone. Far more people die from a combination of malnutrition, disease and other forms of deprivation. All of these count as excess deaths \u2014 separate from violence \u2014 that can be attributed to a food crisis or famine, he said.\nMednick writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "For the first time, the world\u2019s food crises authority announces a famine in Gaza\n- Share via\nGAZA CITY \u2014 After almost two years of war, the Gaza Strip is now in the grips of a famine \u2014 the first widespread hunger declared in the Middle East \u2014 according to the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Friday that famine is happening in Gaza City \u2014 the Gaza Strip\u2019s largest city, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. It\u2019s likely to spread south to Deir al Balah and Khan Yunis by the end of next month and across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid, the United Nations-backed monitor said.\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC has previously determined famines in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region last year.\nThe grim milestone is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been fighting Hamas since the militant group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel says it plans to seize Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, an escalation experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis.\nThe determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel\u2019s restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.\nIsrael rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an \u201coutright lie.\u201d\nGaza City offensive could exacerbate hunger\nThe IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war.\nMore than half a million people in the Gaza Strip, about a quarter of its population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said.\nU.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the findings show a \u201chuman-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself,\u201d and he appealed for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire.\u201d\nIsrael disputes the report\nNetanyahu denies there\u2019s hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation \u201clies\u201d promoted by Hamas. \u201cThe IPC report is an outright lie. Israel does not have a policy of starvation,\u201d his office posted on X.\nThe U.S. State Department also sought to cast doubt on the report. It said the humanitarian situation in Gaza \u201cis a serious concern,\u201d but blamed Hamas and looters for the difficulties in delivering aid.\nAfter the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths in recent weeks, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the United Nations says what\u2019s entering is far below what\u2019s needed.\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory, known as COGAT, called the report \u201cfalse and biased.\u201d It said significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\nIsrael\u2019s Foreign Ministry said more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks. But experts say Gaza is still reeling from the tightening of the blockade from early March until mid-May, when Israel barred the import of all food, medicine and other goods.\n\u201cA rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,\u201d said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nNetanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel\u2019s goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether.\nHow a famine is determined\nThe IPC \u2014 a global initiative comprising 21 organizations and intergovernmental institutions \u2014 says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:\nAt least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, based on a weight-to-height measurement; or 15% of that age group suffer from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their upper arm. And at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nThe data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\nThe IPC warned that a third of Gaza\u2019s population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount.\nAlex de Waal, author of \u201cMass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\u201d and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner.\n\u201cIt seems that it\u2019s necessary for experts to shout \u2018famine!\u2019 before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,\u201d he said.\nIsrael has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. It says there\u2019s currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. It also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid.\nThe traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys.\nWitnesses, health officials and the U.N. rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated.\nA parent in Gaza City watches his children waste away\nOn the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people, about the population of Washington, D.C.\nThroughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighborhoods have been almost completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war, but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.\nDoctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients.\nKirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City\u2019s Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving.\nShe said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished. Thousands will be too weak to evacuate the city ahead of the planned offensive, said Blacka.\nFamilies in Gaza City say they\u2019re watching their loved ones waste away.\nYousef Sbeteh\u2019s two teenage children were wounded by an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they\u2019ve both lost weight because there hasn\u2019t been enough food, he said, adding that he can\u2019t afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions.\nHis 15-year-old daughter, Aya, lost nearly 44 pounds, or about 30% of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 33 pounds. The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say.\n\u201cDoctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,\u201d Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter. \u201cBut I can\u2019t provide that now.\u201d\nShurafa and Mednick write for the Associated Press and reported from Gaza City and Tel Aviv, respectively. AP writers Sally Abou AlJoud in Beirut and Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report."

      "text": "Israeli prime minister denies Gaza hunger as malnourished children flood hospitals daily\n- Share via\nKHAN YUNIS, Gaza Strip \u2014 The dead body of 2-and-a-half-year-old Ro\u2019a Mashi lay on the table in Gaza\u2019s Nasser Hospital, her arms and rib cage skeletal, her eyes sunken in her skull. Doctors say she had no preexisting conditions and wasted away over months as her family struggled to find food and treatment.\nHer family showed the Associated Press a photo of Ro\u2019a\u2019s body at the hospital, and it was confirmed by the doctor who received her remains. Several days after she died, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday told local media, \u201cThere is no hunger. There was no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.\u201d\nIn the face of international outcry, Netanyahu has pushed back, saying reports of starvation are \u201clies\u201d promoted by Hamas.\nHowever, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric this week warned that starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at the highest levels since the war began.\nThe U.N. says nearly 12,000 children under 5 were found to have acute malnutrition in July \u2014 including more than 2,500 with severe malnutrition, the most dangerous level. The World Health Organization says the numbers are likely an undercount.\nThe last two weeks, Israel has allowed around triple the amount of food into Gaza than had been entering since late May. That followed two-and-a-half months when Israel barred all food, medicine and other supplies, saying it was to pressure Hamas to release hostages taken during its 2023 attack that launched the war. The new influx has brought more food within reach for some of the population and lowered some prices in marketplaces, though it remains far more expensive than prewar levels and unaffordable for many.\nWhile better food access might help much of Gaza\u2019s population, \u201cit won\u2019t help the children who are severely malnourished,\u201d said Alex DeWaal, executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, who has worked on famine and humanitarian issues for more than 40 years.\nWhen a person is severely malnourished, vital micronutrients are depleted and bodily functions deteriorate. Simply feeding the person can cause harm, known as \u201crefeeding syndrome,\u201d potentially leading to seizures, coma or death. Instead, micronutrients must first be replenished with supplements and therapeutic milk in a hospital.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about thousands of kids who need to be in hospital if they\u2019re going to have a chance of survival,\u201d DeWaal said. \u201cIf this approach of increasing the food supply had been undertaken two months ago, probably many of those kids would not have gotten into this situation.\u201d\nAny improvement is also threatened by a planned new Israeli offensive that Netanyahu says will capture Gaza City and the tent camps where most of the territory\u2019s population is. That will prompt a huge new wave of displacement and disrupt food delivery, U.N. and aid officials warn.\nPreexisting conditions\nThe Gaza Health Ministry says 42 children died of malnutrition-related causes since July 1, along with 129 adults. It says 106 children have died of malnutrition during the entire war. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, is staffed by medical professionals and its figures on casualties are seen by the U.N. and other experts as the most reliable.\nThe Israeli military Tuesday pointed to the fact that some children who died had preexisting conditions, arguing their deaths were \u201cunrelated to their nutritional status.\u201d It said a review by its experts had concluded there are \u201cno signs of a widespread malnutrition phenomenon\u201d in Gaza.\nAt his press briefing Sunday, Netanyahu spoke in front of a screen reading \u201cFake Starving Children\u201d over photos of skeletal children with preexisting conditions. He accused Hamas of starving the remaining Israeli hostages and repeated claims the militant group is diverting large amounts of aid, a claim the U.N. denies.\nDoctors in Gaza acknowledge that some of those dying or starving have chronic conditions, including cerebral palsy, rickets or genetic disorders, some of which make children more vulnerable to malnutrition. However, those conditions are manageable when food and proper medical treatments are available, they say.\n\u201cThe worsening shortages of food led to these cases\u2019 swift deterioration,\u201d said Dr. Yasser Abu Ghali, head of Nasser\u2019s pediatrics unit. \u201cMalnutrition was the main factor in their deaths.\u201d\nOf 13 emaciated children whose cases the AP has seen since late July, five had no preexisting conditions \u2014 including three who died \u2014 according to doctors.\nAbu Ghali spoke next to the body of Jamal al-Najjar, a 5-year-old who died Tuesday of malnutrition and was born with rickets, which hinders the ability to metabolize vitamins, weakening bones.\nIn the past months, the boy\u2019s weight fell from 35 pounds to 15, said his father, Fadi al-Najjar, whose lean face showed his own hunger.\nAsked about Netanyahu\u2019s claim there was no hunger in Gaza, he pointed at Jamal\u2019s protruding rib cage. \u201cOf course there\u2019s famine,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes a 5-year-old child\u2019s chest normally come to look like this?\u201d\nSkin and bones\nDr. Ahmed al-Farra, Nasser\u2019s general director of pediatrics, said the facility receives 10-20 children with severe malnutrition a day, and the numbers are rising.\nOn Sunday, a severely malnourished 2-year-old, Shamm Qudeih, cried in pain in her hospital bed. Her arms, legs and ribs were skeletal, her belly inflated.\n\u201cShe has lost all fat and muscle,\u201d Al-Farra said. She weighed 9 pounds, a third of a 2-year-old\u2019s normal weight.\nDoctors suspect Shamm suffers from a rare genetic condition called glycogen storage disease, which changes how the body uses and stores glycogen, a form of sugar, and can impact muscle and bone development. But they can\u2019t test for it in Gaza, Al-Farra said.\nNormally, the condition can be managed through a high-carbohydrate diet.\nHer family applied a year ago for medical evacuation, joining a list of thousands the World Health Organization says need urgent treatment abroad. For months, Israel slowed evacuations to a near standstill or halted them for long stretches. But it appears to be stepping up permissions, with more than 60 allowed to leave in the first week of August, according to the U.N.\nPermission for Shamm to leave Gaza finally came this week, and Wednesday, she was heading to a hospital in Italy.\nA child died in her family\u2019s tent\nRo\u2019a was one of four dead children who suffered from malnutrition brought to Nasser over the course of just over two weeks, doctors say.\nHer mother, Fatma Mashi, said she first noticed Ro\u2019a losing weight last year, but she thought it was because she was teething. When she took Ro\u2019a to Nasser Hospital in October, the child was severely malnourished, according to Al-Farra, who said Ro\u2019a had no preexisting conditions.\nAt the time, in the last months of 2024, Israel had reduced aid entry to some of the lowest levels of the war.\nThe family was also displaced multiple times by Israeli military operations. Each move interrupted Ro\u2019a\u2019s treatment as it took time to find a clinic to get nutritional supplements, Mashi said. The family was reduced to one meal a day \u2014 often boiled macaroni \u2014 but \u201cwhatever she ate, it didn\u2019t change anything in her,\u201d Mashi said.\nTwo weeks ago, they moved into the tent camps of Muwasi on Gaza\u2019s southern coast. Ro\u2019a\u2019s decline accelerated.\n\u201cI could tell it was only a matter of two or three more days,\u201d Mashi said in the family\u2019s tent Friday, the day after she had died.\nMashi and her husband, Amin, both looked gaunt, their cheeks and eyes hollow. Their five surviving children \u2014 including a baby born this year \u2014 are thin, but not nearly as emaciated as Ro\u2019a.\nDeWaal said it\u2019s not unusual in famines for one family member to be far worse than others. \u201cMost often it will be a kid who is 18 months or 2 years\u201d who is most vulnerable, he said, while older siblings are \u201cmore robust.\u201d\nBut any number of things can set one child into a spiral of malnutrition, such as an infection or troubles after weaning.\n\u201cA very small thing can push them over.\u201d\nDagga and Keath write for the Associated Press.

  "argos_summary": "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification confirmed famine in Gaza City, citing severe malnutrition, rising deaths, and food shortages amid Israel\u2019s blockade and military operations. Doctors at Shifa Hospital report patients with exposed ribs, drastic weight loss, and lack of nutritional supplements, while the UN and aid groups warn that the crisis could spread without a ceasefire. Israel denies the famine, blaming Hamas for diverting aid, but the UN and medical experts attribute the deaths to starvation and disease. The situation has prompted calls for immediate humanitarian aid and a ceasefire to prevent further loss of life.",
