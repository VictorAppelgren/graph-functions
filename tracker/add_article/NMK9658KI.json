      "title": "Trump says he believes Xi won't act on Taiwan",
      "summary": "Donald Trump claimed that Chinese President Xi Jinping told him he would not pursue Taiwan as long as Trump remained U.S. president, a statement made during a Fox News interview on his way to a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The remark underscores the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, which relies on the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to provide defensive resources without an explicit military guarantee. Trump’s comment follows his earlier suggestion that Taiwan should pay for its own defense. The U.S. has historically avoided direct intervention while maintaining a deterrent stance against Chinese military action on the island.",
