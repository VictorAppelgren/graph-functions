  "content": "The big picture: Warnings that the generative AI market may be forming a dangerous bubble have intensified in recent weeks. With big tech and AI investments playing an outsized role in today's stock market, many are starting to question where the returns are.\n\nSell-offs in numerous tech companies dragged global markets downward this week after a report from MIT's NANDA initiative estimated that almost no AI startups have achieved measurable gains from the technology. The findings add weight to growing warnings that an AI market crash could be looming.\n\nThe report, titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, analyzed 300 public AI implementations, surveyed 350 employees, and interviewed 150 business leaders. Researchers concluded that only about five percent of companies piloting AI saw rapid revenue growth, while the majority stalled.\n\nFollowing the report's release, shares of companies such as Nvidia, Palantir, Arm, Oracle, AMD, and AppLovin slipped by single-digit percentages on Tuesday. The news pushed the Nasdaq down 1.4 percent, the S&P 500 by 0.7 percent, Stoxx Europe by 0.6 percent, Japan's Nikkei 225 by 1.5 percent, and South Korea's Kospi by 0.6 percent.\n\nAditya Challapally, lead author of the MIT report, told Fortune that the few successful AI startups typically focus on one specialized area and maintain close collaboration with clients. Some have grown revenue from zero to $20 million in just a year.\n\nThe report also found that while most AI investment has gone toward marketing and sales tools, back-end automation delivers the highest returns. These include solutions for streamlining outsourcing and other operational processes.\n\nAdditionally, while most companies try to build their own AI tools, those that purchase solutions from specialized providers are far more likely to succeed. The most effective tools adapt to specific parameters, unlike general-purpose systems such as ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently acknowledged that many new AI firms attracting venture capital are setting unrealistic expectations, warning that a resulting bubble could lead to historic losses when it bursts. His comments echo those of economist Torsten Slok, who has argued that the AI boom is more overhyped than the dot-com bubble of the 1990s.\n\nLast year, Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong noted that the S&P 500 was weakening outside of Nvidia and other AI-focused chipmakers. More recently, tech analyst Edward Zitron argued that sales of Nvidia GPUs \u2013 responsible for nearly eight percent of US stock market value \u2013 remain the primary source of AI-related profits. Any disruption in this feedback loop could have major repercussions for the handful of tech giants that make up more than one-third of the market.",

      "text": "Good morning. Companies are betting on AI\u2014yet nearly all enterprise pilots are stuck at the starting line.\nThe GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, a new report published by MIT\u2019s NANDA initiative, reveals that while generative AI holds promise for enterprises, most initiatives to drive rapid revenue growth are falling flat.\nDespite the rush to integrate powerful new models, about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration; the vast majority stall, delivering little to no measurable impact on P&L. The research\u2014based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments\u2014paints a clear divide between success stories and stalled projects.\nTo unpack these findings, I spoke with Aditya Challapally, the lead author of the report, and a research contributor to project NANDA at MIT.\n\u201cSome large companies\u2019 pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,\u201d Challapally said. Startups led by 19- or 20-year-olds, for example, \u201chave seen revenues jump from zero to $20 million in a year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools,\u201d he added.\nBut for 95% of companies in the dataset, generative AI implementation is falling short. The core issue? Not the quality of the AI models, but the \u201clearning gap\u201d for both tools and organizations. While executives often blame regulation or model performance, MIT\u2019s research points to flawed enterprise integration. Generic tools like ChatGPT excel for individuals because of their flexibility, but they stall in enterprise use since they don\u2019t learn from or adapt to workflows, Challapally explained.\nThe data also reveals a misalignment in resource allocation. More than half of generative AI budgets are devoted to sales and marketing tools, yet MIT found the biggest ROI in back-office automation\u2014eliminating business process outsourcing, cutting external agency costs, and streamlining operations.\nWhat\u2019s behind successful AI deployments?\nHow companies adopt AI is crucial. Purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors and building partnerships succeed about 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often.\nThis finding is particularly relevant in financial services and other highly regulated sectors, where many firms are building their own proprietary generative AI systems in 2025. Yet, MIT\u2019s research suggests companies see far more failures when going solo.\nCompanies surveyed were often hesitant to share failure rates, Challapally noted. \u201cAlmost everywhere we went, enterprises were trying to build their own tool,\u201d he said, but the data showed purchased solutions delivered more reliable results.\nOther key factors for success include empowering line managers\u2014not just central AI labs\u2014to drive adoption, and selecting tools that can integrate deeply and adapt over time.\nWorkforce disruption is already underway, especially in customer support and administrative roles. Rather than mass layoffs, companies are increasingly not backfilling positions as they become vacant. Most changes are concentrated in jobs previously outsourced due to their perceived low value.\nThe report also highlights the widespread use of \u201cshadow AI\u201d\u2014unsanctioned tools like ChatGPT\u2014and the ongoing challenge of measuring AI\u2019s impact on productivity and profit.\nLooking ahead, the most advanced organizations are already experimenting with agentic AI systems that can learn, remember, and act independently within set boundaries\u2014offering a glimpse at how the next phase of enterprise AI might unfold.\nSheryl Estrada\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nLeaderboard\nMichael A. Discenza was appointed VP and CFO of The Timken Company (NYSE: TKR), effective immediately. Discenza has 25 years of experience at Timken in roles of increasing responsibility, including the last 10 as VP of finance, and group controller.\nJohn Cole was appointed CFO of ELB Learning, a provider of immersive learning solutions. He brings more than 25 years of experience leading finance and operations for Fortune 100 and 500 companies, according to ELB. Cole aims to strengthen the financial infrastructure to support the company\u2019s next phase of growth.\nBig Deal\nThe report\u2019s findings are based on a survey of more than 1,500 manufacturing leaders across 17 major manufacturing countries. Cybersecurity now ranks among the top external risks, second only to inflation and economic growth. One-third of respondents hold responsibilities spanning both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity.\nNearly half (48%) of cybersecurity professionals identified securing converged architectures as key to positive outcomes over the next five years, compared to just 37% of all respondents.\nHowever, a shortage of skilled talent, training challenges, and rising labor costs remain major hurdles. As manufacturers recruit the next generation, cybersecurity and analytical skills are becoming hiring priorities\u2014reinforcing the need to align technical innovation with human development, according to the report.\nGoing deeper\nOverheard\n\u201cEvery single Monday was called 'AI Monday.' You couldn\u2019t have customer calls, you couldn\u2019t work on budgets, you had to only work on AI projects.\u201d\n\u2014Eric Vaughan, CEO of enterprise software company IgniteTech, told Fortune in an interview that he established a mandate: on Mondays, staff could only work on AI. In early 2023, convinced generative AI was an \u201cexistential\u201d transformation, Vaughan saw that his team was not fully on board. His ultimate response? He replaced nearly 80% of the staff within a year, according to headcount figures reviewed by Fortune."
