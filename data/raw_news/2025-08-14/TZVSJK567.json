  "title": "As Trump Seizes D.C.\u2019s Police, Critics Say He\u2019s Undercut Its Ability to Fight Crime",
  "description": "The Trump administration has taken steps that have hobbled Washington\u2019s efforts to reduce crime, such as gutting its U.S. attorney\u2019s office and enacting budget cuts of more than $1 billion.",
  "content": "When President Trump announced Monday that the federal government would take control of Washington\u2019s police department, he described the move as necessary to \u201crescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.\u201d\n\nBut in the more than six months since taking office, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, and in some cases inaction, have hobbled Washington\u2019s efforts to reduce crime, drawing complaints from city leaders who say he is now trying to solve a problem that he has actually made worse.\n\nCity officials point to vacancies at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington and on the Superior Court \u2014 staffing controlled by the federal government \u2014 as well as budget cuts of more than $1 billion as examples of how Mr. Trump has made it more difficult for law enforcement officials to combat crime. And while city leaders readily admit they have work to do to improve public safety, they argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s picture of Washington as a dystopian hellscape is far from the reality.\n\n\u201cFrom having our courts be less able to hear and try and render justice to our ability to prosecute cases, the administration has absolutely harmed the District\u2019s ability,\u201d said Charles Allen, a Democratic member of the District of Columbia Council. \u201cNow despite that of course, the city has done incredible work, I think, over the last two years as we have been able to lower violent crime significantly.\u201d",
