  "content": "Venus Williams says playing in the U.S. Open again isn\u2019t old \u2014 it\u2019s exciting.\n\nThe icon may as well have been talking about herself.\n\n\u201cSuper thrilling to be back,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt does not get old. It just gets more exciting.\u201d\n\nWhen Williams takes on 11th-ranked Karolina Muchova on Monday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, it will be her record-extending 25th appearance in the U.S. Open.\n\nIt comes at the ripe age of 45, making her the oldest player to compete in singles at the U.S. Open since 47-year-old Ren\u00e9e Richards set the record in 1981.\n\n\u201cI love my job,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo there\u2019s the joy right there.\u201d\n\nWhile Williams is one of the all-time greats, with seven Grand Slam singles titles, including in 2000 and 2001 here in Flushing Meadows, this was an unexpected comeback.\n\nShe got a wild-card entry after being ranked 610th in the world.\n\nIt comes following a 16-month layoff from tennis that included surgery for uterine fibroids.\n\nShe had just returned last month at the Washington Open.\n\n\u201cI want to be my best, and that\u2019s the expectation I have for myself, to get the best out of me. That\u2019s all any player can ask for,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played as much as the other players, so it\u2019s a different challenge when you\u2019re dealing with that. So I\u2019m just trying to have fun, stay relaxed and be my personal best.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s appearance comes 28 years after Williams\u2019 1997 debut at the U.S. Open, and she doesn\u2019t plan to stop swinging a racket anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll always play tennis. It\u2019s in my DNA. So it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s now or 30 years from now,\u201d Williams said. \u201cGod willing, I\u2019ll be here. We\u2019ll all be here. We\u2019ll all be hitting balls. But in any case, tennis will always be one of the most important parts of my life.\u201d\n\nTaylor Fritz beat Emilio Nava 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 and has won 22 of his past 27 matches since the end of the French Open, the most wins of any man on tour over that span.\n\nHe\u2019ll have two days off before playing Sebastian Baez or Lloyd Harris.\n\nNo. 6 Ben Shelton ripped Ignacio Buse 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 and faces either Pablo Carreno Busta or Pablo Llamas Ruiz.\n\nShelton \u2014 an entertainer whose celebrations seemingly vexed Novak Djokovic \u2014 was asked if he\u2019d like to see tennis ease up on the stoic decorum and etiquette, citing the attention the Noah Lyles-Kenny Bednarek beef in track and field has drawn.\n\n\u201cYeah, I understand respecting your opponents and the traditions of tennis. At the same time, people get called out for little things or the wrong things that it\u2019s, like, really? We\u2019re going to give someone a hard time about that?\u201d Shelton said. \u201cHaving a younger crowd in tennis is really important in attracting younger fans, the future fans of our sport. The kids love the flair and excitement and competition, and Bednarek shoving Lyles and them talking about it in the press conference afterwards, it\u2019s exciting.\n\n\u201cNow when they go to Tokyo for the World Championships, something\u2019s on the line and everyone\u2019s tuning in. That\u2019s sports.\u201d",

      "text": "Emma Raducanu\u2019s smile is back.\nSo is her game.\nThe young Brit broke her three-year U.S. Open drought, winning her first match in Flushing Meadows since the breakthrough 2021 title that changed her life.\nRadacanu rolled past qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2 at Louis Armstrong Stadium with a 26-minute first set and a brisk one-hour domination.\nShe\u2019s cleared a huge mental hurdle, making New York her happy place for the first time in years.\n\u201cYeah, it has been on my mind,\u201d said Radacanu, 22. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years, and it\u2019s a very special tournament for me. I did feel different coming into it this year. I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it\u2019s in the back of your head. So I\u2019m just very pleased to have overcome that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first win here since 2021, so it\u2019s extra special. First rounds are always difficult and especially at a Slam. I\u2019m just so happy with the way I came through that.\u201d\nRadacanu won the 2021 U.S. Open as an 18-year-old qualifier, dazzling with not just her game but her megawatt smile.\nBut after her title defense ended with a first-round loss to Alize Cornet \u2014 making her just the fourth reigning U.S. Open champ ousted in the opening round \u2014 she missed 2023 due to injury and suffered another first-round exit last year to Sofia Kenin.\nShe acknowledged New York had become a mental hurdle.\n\u201cI really struggled when I came back in 2022. I didn\u2019t enjoy coming back here,\u201d Radacanu said. \u201cNow is the first time that I feel like I can come back to the U.S. Open and really enjoy the memories that I made here. I can be proud of that and see it as a happy place.\u201d\nRadacanu looked happy on the court Sunday, serving well and taking an aggressive return position.\nShe seemed confident, self-assured and in control.\nShe also seemed comfortable with her new coach, Francisco Roig.\nRafa Nadal\u2019s ex-coach, the Spaniard constantly gave loud positive reinforcement.\n\u201cI put a lot of trust in what I\u2019m doing with Francisco on the practice court,\u201d Radacanu said. \u201cWe\u2019re just working really well, doing the right stuff on the practice court, and I just feel like I\u2019m improving. To take confidence from what I\u2019m doing behind the scenes and not just have confidence because I\u2019ve won these matches on the tour.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a lot day to day. It\u2019s going well, and I\u2019m enjoying it. I\u2019m enjoying getting better, and the process of feeling like, at the end of the day, I\u2019m satisfied I got a little bit better and just repeating it. That\u2019s probably the biggest success and reason why I feel the way I do right now.\u201d\nDespite being nervous beforehand, starting quickly helped Radacanu settle in.\nShe ended up with an encouragingly clean match, just six unforced errors \u2014 one in the second set \u2014 to 36 by her outmatched Japanese foe.\nRaducanu raced out to a quick 5-0 lead and cruised.\n\u201cI started off really well, and that helped relax me a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially serving first game, that was a confident start, and then I felt like I could keep going.\u201d\nNow, Raducanu has a chance to keep going.\nShe\u2019s provisionally up to world No. 33 in the live rankings after the win and well-placed to crack the top 30.\nWith No. 24 Veronika Kudermetova getting upset by Janice Tjen, Raducanu gets to face another qualifier.\nWith an extra day baked into the first round this year, she\u2019ll get some free time in New York, now a happy place again.\n\u201cMy nana \u2014 it\u2019s not my actual grandma, but I\u2019m like her adopted granddaughter, I\u2019d like to think \u2014 she\u2019s from New York, and she told me to go to the Frick Collection,\u201d Raducanu said. \u201cI\u2019ve been into my art a lot more recently, and it\u2019s reopened after I think four or five years of being under construction. That will be really exciting.\u201d"

There has been NFL domination by the Patriots and Chiefs over much of the past two decades. The Canadiens, Islanders and Oilers had deeds to the Stanley Cup for the better part of 20 years.

      "text": "It\u2019s the middle of US Open Fan Week, and Peter Rundquist is sitting on a bench inside the Chase Center at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.\nNo, Rundquist wasn\u2019t waiting to take the court for a qualifying round match \u2014 instead, he was waiting to meet his date who would be part of a new reality show being produced by the US Open and Fresh Tape Media.\nRundquist, 26, and his date Julia Drahzal, 26, were two of the 16 singles looking for a doubles partner in life at the US Open as part of \u201cGame, Set, Matchmaker.\u201d\nThe endeavor was filmed during Fan Week and followed around eight randomly paired couples as they saw if they\u2019re a match while experiencing a first date together at the famed tennis tournament in Queens.\n\u201cI\u2019m a single guy living in New York, and I think this tennis tournament is kind of a perfect culmination of the youth in New York City. Just the energy around here, you can feel it, and I\u2019m a huge tennis fan as of recently,\u201d Rundquist told The Post about why he wanted to take part in the show \u2014 which will air on the tournament\u2019s YouTube page \u2014 shortly before going on his date.\n\u201cI think if you have the opportunity to do something different, why would you not say yes?\u201d Drahzal explained as her reasoning for taking part. \u201cI think definitely in the city as a woman, I\u2019m sure there are a lot of women out there that can relate to the idea that, or to the feeling that dating is definitely very tiring and this is just a way to make it more exciting.\u201d\nWhile love is the name of the game for \u201cGame, Set, Matchmaker,\u201d US Open officials have a much loftier goal in mind when they decided to jump into the reality dating show business.\nThe USTA is hoping to tap into the increasing number of people who have taken to dating shows like \u201cLove Island,\u201d \u201cLove is Blind\u201d and \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\nThe idea would be that the show, which features plenty of the off-the-court activities at the US Open, would serve as an \u201centry point\u201d for people who aren\u2019t traditional tennis or even sports fans.\n\u201cThinking about just new ways to reach new audiences, especially with content. These days, there\u2019s so much when it comes to streaming and social media channels,\u201d Jonathan Zipper, director of social media for the USTA, explained to The Post.\n\u201cI\u2019d say it started with the audience segment, which is Gen Z and millennials, trying to reach 21 to 44-year-olds. In kind of thinking about that, we were wondering, what are some of the themes and types of content that are most engaging to those audience segments? And right now, dating shows and reality TV in general are very popular with that audience segment.\u201d\nZipper isn\u2019t wrong about the popularity of dating shows, especially this summer.\n\u201cLove Island,\u201d which airs on Peacock, was the most-streamed show in America the week of its Season 7 finale and Nielsen data reported that more than 50 percent of the viewers were adults under the age of 35.\nWith the success of dating shows and the natural word play with the sport of tennis, which starts at love-love, \u201cthat\u2019s what led us to this concept in the first place,\u201d Zipper explained.\nThe US Open had originally announced the show with a format that more closely resembled \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d which would have seen one woman matched with several contestants to see which one she chooses.\nThe format was changed to include eight couples, which were found through a casting agency, and set them up to see if they end up being a match.\nThe concept shift is part of a broader strategy to allow for US Open attendees to participate through social media to share their own love stories at the US Open through the hashtag \u201cLoveAtTheUSOpen\u201d and incorporate social media influencers to promote the theme through their own platforms.\nThe eight people who were chosen had to have some passion for the sport of tennis and an interest in experiencing the US Open.\nThe dates themselves revolve around an activity that was taking place during Fan Week, from a silent disco, playing Red Ball, taking a tennis lesson or experiencing the food.\nReaction to the idea of a Grand Slam putting on a dating show was mixed among tennis fans, some of whom took to social media to chide the idea.\nBut USTA officials were mindful of the balance they were trying to strike with the project, helping to promote the sport and the US Open specifically, which has become as much of a seen-and-be-seen extravanganza as it is a major sporting event, while preserving the prestige.\n\u201cWe have a lot of traditional fans, and we want to maintain the integrity of the event, but we also want the ability to push the envelope and tap into it,\u201d Nicole Kankam, the managing director of Pro Tennis Marketing and Entertainment for the USTA, said.\n\u201cWe, for sure, make sure that we\u2019re maintaining the integrity of the championship,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to disturb the integrity of that tennis court product, but as fans become accustomed to any entertainment or sports event that you\u2019re going to be engaged in different ways.\n\u201cI think a lot of people have come to expect that if you go to a football game or a baseball game, that you have the product on the field, but you\u2019re also looking for ways to be engaged and entertained beyond that.\u201d\nBack inside the Chase Center, Rundquist and Drahzal are treated to a tennis lesson and a few Honey Deuces as they see if the two \u2014 one a Minnesota native who recently moved to New York City and the other a New Jerseyan who migrated across the Hudson river \u2014 were a match.\nAs the tennis lesson heated up, so did the quips.\n\u201cAre you sweating because of the tennis or because of me?\u201d Drahzal jokingly asked at one point during the date, as a camera crew filmed everything and a photographer and reporter from The Post observed.\n\u201cI hope my date crushes me a little bit so I can laugh it off and laugh it off on camera,\u201d Rundquist joked. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfect just to enjoy, get the heart rate up a little bit while talking to a beautiful woman, obviously, I think will be great.\u201d\nDrahzal had said she was optimistic heading into the date and was excited to experience the US Open in a \u201cunique way\u201d this year, but also appreciated the potential role she could play in helping to get more fans out to the US Open and into tennis.\n\u201cI think knowing that maybe there\u2019s someone out there like me who wasn\u2019t really into tennis and now, maybe has a little bit of intrigue, is now gonna be interested in the US Open and like every other open. I think that feels really nice because it\u2019s like, oh, maybe I could make a difference in someone\u2019s interests,\u201d she said."
