      "summary": "Asian shares rose as U.S. stocks hit record highs ahead of the August jobs report, boosting sentiment that the Fed may cut rates. The Nikkei gained 0.9% on stronger Japanese labor and household data, while Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other Asian markets saw modest gains. U.S. Treasury yields fell to 4.16% on expectations of a rate cut, lifting the S&P 500 to a new record. Oil prices slipped slightly, and the dollar weakened against the yen and euro. The rally reflects optimism that a softer labor market could prompt the Fed to ease policy in September.",
