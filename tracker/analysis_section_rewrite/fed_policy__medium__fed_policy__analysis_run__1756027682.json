      "feedback": "Strong start, but the piece needs a clean 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, timing, and invalidation rules, plus tighter linkages to the data in the sources. Actionable edits: 1) Reconstruct as a formal three‑scenario framework (Base, Bull, Bear) anchored to the horizon; for each scenario specify a) catalysts and timing windows (e.g., Fed easing starting with a 50bp cut in September, per C22MKA9VY; total ~150–175bp by year‑end), b) medium‑term macro/flows channels (IPO momentum from 95 deals in 2025 and $12.9b raised vs 2024; WFE demand/China tensions), c) company‑specific progress (ACMR maintains 2025 revenue guidance $850–$950m; Q2 revenue $215m, gross margin 49.4%, debt/equity 23%), d) price path and ranges (Base: toward consensus target $34.76, implying a 3–6 month range of roughly $34–$36; Bull: $38–$42 if rate cuts are larger/earlier and IPOs accelerate; Bear: $30–$32 if policy or trade tensions surprise negatively). 2) Tie each trigger to exact data points and cite after each claim; avoid vague statements. 3) Add explicit invalidation criteria for each scenario (e.g., Base invalidated if ACMR misses 2025 guidance by more than a few percent; Bull invalidated if Fed cuts stall or ACMR’s WFE ramp disappoints; Bear triggered if export controls escalate or Russell 2000/SMID sector metrics deteriorate). 4) Strengthen the cross‑asset logic by clearly mapping the causal chain: rate cuts → lower risk premia → higher small/mid cap rotation → greater multiple-expansion for niche names like ACMR; tie to the Morningstar small‑cap regime thesis (Q7VVGNSQE) and to IPO/quality signals (also in Q7VVGNSQE). 5) Improve the emphasis on timing and path‑dependence: introduce monthly checkpoints (e.g., Sep, Oct, Nov) and note whether outcomes are contingent on policy path versus IPO momentum; state confidence level explicitly (e.g., base 40–50%, bull 20–30%, bear 20%). 6) Replace or dovetail generic statements with quantified story‑lines: e.g., “ACMR’s 2025 guidance anchors revenue; if WFE demand stays robust into Q3 and capex cycles firm, ACMR can sustain or modestly beat $34–$36 by year‑end.” 7) Clarify watch‑list signals and include discrete numeric thresholds where possible (e.g., rate‑cut pace via FOMC communications; IPO pace sustaining above ~90–100 deals year‑to‑date; Russell 2000 relative valuation/take‑up signals). 8) Ensure citations are attached to data points and avoid mixing duplication across SK994CBWR, Q7VVGNSQE, and C22MKA9VY; reconcile any contradictory points (e.g., long‑term EBITDA/revenue targets vs. near‑term 3–6 month drivers) so the narrative remains coherent across sources. 9) Tighten the formatting to meet the SECTION FOCUS: end with Base case, 1–2 alts, risks, watch‑list signals, and a clearly stated confidence. 10) Add a short, explicit “valuation/flow” paragraph that keeps ACMR’s 2025 guidance and 2028 revenue target as context but shows why they matter for a 3–6 month path, without extrapolating to 2028 as a near‑term catalyst. This will elevate depth, reduce vagueness, and improve first‑principles grounding and scenario credibility. Citations to anchor every key data point should be (SK994CBWR)(Q7VVGNSQE)(C22MKA9VY).",
