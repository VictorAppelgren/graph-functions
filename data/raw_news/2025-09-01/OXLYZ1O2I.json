  "content": "Manchester City are ready to sanction an exit for Ederson \u2014 if they sign Gianluigi Donnarumma as his replacement.\n\nParis Saint-Germain, the Italy international\u2019s current club, expect Donnarumma to make a move to the Etihad Stadium before Monday\u2019s transfer deadline.\n\nBrazil international Ederson is a target for Fenerbahce in a potential deal worth around \u20ac14million (\u00a312.1m) over the closing hours of the summer window.\n\nEderson joined City in June 2017 in a \u00a335million transfer from Portuguese side Benfica. He has made 372 appearances for the club, keeping 168 clean sheets.\n\nHe has enjoyed a glittering career in the north west, winning the Premier League six times in eight seasons and helping the club win the Champions League for the first time in 2023.\n\nShould a move progress Donnarumma would follow James Trafford as a new goalkeeping arrival this summer after the England Under-21 international joined from Burnley in July.\n\nDonnarumma was left out of Luis Enrique\u2019s squad for the European Super Cup win over Tottenham Hotspur in Udine in August.\n\nLuis Enrique previously revealed the club had wanted a \u201cdifferent goalkeeping profile\u201d and signed France international Lucas Chevalier from Lille.\n\n\u201cThese are always difficult decisions to make,\u201d Luis Enrique said of the decision to omit Donnarumma from his matchday squad. \u201cI can definitely talk about Gigio, because he\u2019s one of the best players in his position, without a doubt. He\u2019s even better as a person. We\u2019re looking for a goalkeeping profile different from Donnarumma. It\u2019s always difficult to make the decision in these kinds of situations.\u201d\n\nLast season, Donnarumma saved two penalties in PSG\u2019s Champions League round of 16 match against Liverpool, to send the French champions through on their way to their first-ever European Cup win.\n\nThis marked an upturn in form after he was at fault for two Arsenal goals in the earlier league phase that left PSG vulnerable to being knocked out.\n\nHe has made 161 total appearances for the Paris club since his arrival, keeping 56 clean sheets. Last season he played 47 times including every Club World Cup game as PSG reached the final in the summer, despite suffering a facial injury in December.\n\nThe 26-year-old joined PSG in 2021 from AC Milan, having been at the Italian side since 2013 as a youth player.\n\nDonnarumma has made 74 senior international appearances for Italy since his debut at 17 years old in 2017. He captained the national side to their delayed European Championship win in 2021, beating England in the final on penalties and earning the Player of the Tournament award.",

      "text": "Eyes fixed on his feet, hands stitched to the inside of his trouser pockets, Pep Guardiola dragged himself onto the Amex turf before Darren England had even brought the whistle down from his mouth.\nNo handshake for Fabian Hurzeler. No word spoken to a single player over the next three minutes. No sense of direction as he wandered aimlessly into the middle of the pitch before dutifully applauding the travelling fans behind the goal.\nAdvertisement\nIt encapsulated Manchester City\u2019s final half-hour against Brighton & Hove Albion, a blur in which they showed no emotional spike and simply acquiesced to their fate.\nThis 2-1 defeat, following the 2-0 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, leaves City on three points after three games. It is the lowest points tally of Guardiola\u2019s career at this stage of a league season and the first time they have been below Manchester United in the Premier League table after three or more matchweeks since September 2021 \u2014 there have been six managers in the dugout at Old Trafford in that time.\nAs much as it captures the instability at United, it underlines the sheer length of time Guardiola and his players have lived with a sense of invincibility \u2014 and why they may be struggling to deal with moments of adversity now it has vanished.\nCity had controlled the game for the first hour and, although the big chances dried up after Erling Haaland, scorer of the opening goal on 34 minutes, squandered three in the opening 25 minutes, it felt like Brighton had run out of ideas.\nA Hail Mary quadruple substitution by Brighton after 60 minutes inevitably shook up the pattern of the game and injected energy into the stadium but it was expected that City would ride the wave and find a way to dial down the heat.\nJames Milner and Co brought an energy that Hurzeler said spread like a \u201cvirus\u201d as Brighton scored twice to turn the game on its head.\nThe concern for Guardiola is that the only thing contagious in his team appeared to be acceptance of what was coming. City succumbed too meekly given their spine included Ruben Dias, John Stones, Rodri and Haaland at the end of the match.\n\u201cKid mistakes\u201d is how Rodri described his team\u2019s lack of care on the ball, while Guardiola said his team \u201cforgot to continue playing\u201d after conceding a penalty awarded for a handball by Matheus Nunes, put away by Milner for Brighton\u2019s first.\nAdvertisement\nNico O\u2019Reilly and Jeremy Doku came on in the 72nd minute to try to inject some drive into the team but City were not able to re-establish control and when Dias and Rico Lewis came on for Abdukodir Khusanov and Nunes 13 minutes later, it felt like an attempt to escape with a point.\nIt would have been unthinkable a year ago, but this is what happens when a team loses its aura. Brighton attacked with abandon and City could not muster any form of resistance as they gradually ceded more and more ground to the home side.\nCity may well have believed that a summer break would cure their ails and time would simply consign last season\u2019s mid-season collapse to room 101, but the rest of the league does not forget.\nWhat City internalise as an anomaly, the Premier League\u2019s ferocious middle class view as wounds waiting to be reopened.\nA champion boxer being put on his backside for the first time alters perception and removes a layer of the mystique. A granite chin is a mirage that cannot be rekindled once vulnerability has been witnessed. It humanises them, reframes their flaws from abstract to actionable.\nThe same applies to City. Once a team like them collapses as dramatically as they did for as long as they did, they cross the rubicon.\nManagers are no longer as cautious, players are no longer as submissive, supporters are no longer as in awe. When City go 1-0 up in the first half teams are no longer bunkering down to limit damage, they are punching their way out of the corner.\nDespite the two losses, City do not need to enter crisis mode again. They are nowhere near the bleak period they endured between October and February last season but they do not currently look capable of the consistency required to win the title.\nKhusanov performed well alongside Stones and has the pace to carry out the aggressive high line, Tijjani Reijnders is of high calibre and Oscar Bobb looks ready to make the right-wing his own.\nAdvertisement\nThe issue is that there are too many positions that remain undecided and too many questions hanging over individuals. Goalkeeper, right-back, centre-back, the right of midfield and left-wing are all in a seemingly permanent state of flux and the wide areas are still being targeted.\nCity have a stockpile of very good, if not great, players but they are lacking chemistry. The defensive line is far too often out of alignment, the midfield is still searching for balance between security and verve, while the front three are lucky to combine more than a handful of times per game.\nThere is much to ponder for Guardiola but his team look like they are experiencing the growing pains that come with being in transition and coming to terms with no longer possessing a fear factor.\n(Top photo: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)"
