  "title": "Big Business This Week: Is Elon Musk toxic for Tesla?",
  "description": "Elon Musk may not have founded Tesla, but he has become the company, and it\u2019s become him. Now sales are plummeting. Is he toxic for the Tesla?",
  "content": "Elon Musk may not have founded Tesla, but he has become the company, and it\u2019s become him. Now sales are plummeting, and while the share price is up 65% in the past year, investors are concerned about the close link between Musk, with his multiple projects and controversial political stands, and a company that makes cars and promises to create the next industrial revolution. To understand what Musk must do next, BBTW editor Peter Green spoke with Howard Yu, the Lego professor of management and innovation at IMD Business School in Lausanne.\n\nMusk made Tesla $TSLA what it is, with his visionary talk and insane work ethic. But in 2025, is he still good for Tesla, or is he toxic?\n\nThat visionary talk and insane work ethic are okay in my mind. Nvidia $NVDA and Taiwan Semiconductor $TSM are also insane on the work ethic front. What is less desirable is when the CEO\u2019s focus is less about chasing purely scientific breakthroughs or unparalleled service to customers, but instead they get distracted by politics and don\u2019t seem able to focus. Then we have a problem.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges facing Tesla now, and how would you, as a management guru, advise Musk to handle them?\n\nFind a successor. Delegate stuff he doesn\u2019t like, just as he does with SpaceX. Build a strong bench of competent managers. If he\u2019s Steve Jobs, he\u2019ll also need a Tim Cook.\n\nDo you think Musk can accept that he will need strong leaders at Tesla to guide the company forward?\n\nNope. That\u2019s his personality. Maybe he\u2019ll learn. Again, he did so at SpaceX. But we haven\u2019t yet seen him moving in that direction for Tesla so far. Perhaps he\u2019s running into a wall when it comes to attracting top-level, world-class, big-name talent.\n\nRolling out the robotaxi. If you cannot get Robotaxi, how can anybody trust you can do a humanoid robot? So that would be a not-too-distant-future test that Elon Musk is facing.\n\nDoes Musk have the detail-oriented enthusiasm needed to run Tesla as a car company?\n\nHe\u2019s just not interested in that part. But what he\u2019s interested in, of course, is AI, maybe potentially taking over OpenAI, continuing to accelerate Grok, and continuing to go into humanoids. So, in the ideal world, he would be able to delegate, just like at SpaceX, the day-to-day operations to someone to just run Tesla.\n\nBut you never want your company to be led by an irreplaceable man?\n\nThat is the Tesla conundrum: at some point, you need to pass the torch to the next generation. Other companies that stay relevant over centuries develop generational leaders. And Elon Musk, because of his personal insecurity, you can read this in his biography, he appears to feel that when he becomes dispensable, that threatens his own self-worth.\n\nIf Elon Musk has a stroke tomorrow, or just does too much Ketamine, is that the collapse of Tesla forever?\n\nThat would be a setback. Which are the companies that have gone through maturity and a new generation of managers? Microsoft has gone through that, Google has gone through that, Tesla has not. If something happened to Elon, even when he has put the company on a path to success, because of the sheer persona he imposed on the company, there\u2019s no way that Tesla\u2019s not going to suffer for a few years. And if deep down in the organization, there\u2019s no one really able to figure it out as a CEO, it would be gone forever.\n\nDon\u2019t increase the exposure, but just hold.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for brevity and clarity.\n\u2022 Google, Apple, and the domino effect: Sometime soon U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta will decide on a remedy for Google\u2019s illegal monopoly on Internet search and ads. At the heart of the dilemma is the $20 billion a year that Google parent Alphabet $GOOGL pays Apple $AAPL to make Google the default search engine on all Apple devices, directing many more billions of dollars in search ad revenue to Google. It sure looked like curtains for Google\u2019s endless cash stream. But the impending dominance of AI results in internet search may have completely shifted the paradigm: Now it\u2019s Apple that could see its pre-tax profit crash 7% and Google that could save 20% of its cash flow, freed from expensive arrangements that are suddenly yielding less demand. And that still might not help consumers escape the monopoly: Microsoft\u2019s 20-year, $100 billion bet on Bing has only yielded a 7.65% market share to Google\u2019s 86%.\n\u2022 Exxon\u2019s Russia Play: Oil giant Exxon Mobil $XOM has met with senior Russian energy officials to revive a joint venture to pump oil and gas from fields off Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, the Wall Street Journal reports. Washington has allowed U.S. companies to talk with Russia about assets left there when sanctions were imposed after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Letting Exxon back in as part of a peace deal has been part of on-again, off-again talks with Russia. Exxon wrote off its Russia stake for $4 billion, and wants to get that back.\n\u2022 Nvidia Envy? The world\u2019s most valuable public company did it again: Posting record sales of $46.7 billion in the quarter ending in July, with net income of $26.4 billion up 59% from a year ago. Still, Nvidia $NVDA shares dropped 3% in aftermarket trading as the company said the China-U.S. trade war could hit sales in the second half of the year, and as analysts worry the rush to build AI computing centers may stall, stymied by a lack of electrical power, and uncertain demand as dozens of new data hubs come online at once. That could crimp demand for Nvidia\u2019s famous AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang said he sees companies spending $3 trillion to $4 trillion over the next five years on AI chips, and expects to capture about a third of that.\n\u2022 Peet\u2019s coffee joins an original crowd. Look around these days and there is definitely a Dr. Pepper craze. Keurig Dr Pepper $KDP is buying Peets for about $18 billion. Keurig Dr Pepper, the coffee and fizzy drink firm created in 2018 when the OG soft drink owner was bought by the original coffee pod maker, hasn\u2019t been doing well, as the coffee industry is losing its buzz from a grande mix of factors: Soaring bean prices, up 49% so far this year, a climate-led 18% decline in Brazilian coffee production from last year, and a 50% Trump tariff on Brazilian imports. Keurig says it plans to split its coffee business from soda (it also owns 7-Up and Snapple), and complete the deal in the first half of 2026. Shares dropped about 18% on the news.\n\u2022 The Cracker\u2019s back: Cracker Barrel $CBRL is bringing back the old guy. A streamlined design for the roadside rest stop\u2019s iconic logo went over about as well as New Coke, with President Donald Trump urging the chain to \u201cadmit a mistake,\u201d and revert to the old logo. \u201cThey got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right,\u201d Trump posted on his own social media platform, for 42,000 likes. \u201cWe said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our \u201cOld Timer\u201d will remain,\u201d Cracker Barrel tweeted, to 227,000 likes. Shares in Cracker Barrel dropped 9% on the new logo\u2019s announcement, but are now 4.4% higher than before the kerfuffle began.\n\u2022 This clock don\u2019t Tok: The deadline for Chinese-owned TikTok to find a U.S. buyer will probably be pushed back from mid-September, as talks to find a new owner drag on. Trump says he has \u201cvery substantial American buyers\u201d lined up, and the White House also launched its own TikTok channel.\n\u2022 You Got Amazoned: Corporate employees at Whole Foods are losing their supermarket discount and other perks, including four weeks of annual work-from-home, under a plan that will see them get new job offers from Whole Foods parent Amazon $AMZN. Since Amazon paid $13.7 billion for Whole Foods in 2017, sales are up more than 40%, but market share is down as Walmart $WMT and Costco $COST grab more grocery dollars.\n\u2022 Hot Soon? After a failed partnership with McDonald\u2019s $MCD , Krispy Kreme $DNUT is taking its oversugared donuts to big box retailers, including Costco $COST and Walmart $WMT (them, again?!), in an effort to rebuild the brand. Shares have dropped 66% in the past year, and sales dropped 13.4% in the last quarter. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase $JPM downgraded Krispy Kreme this week, as shares dropped 3.49% on Wednesday. The problem bedeviling Krispy Kreme? Getting their donuts to the store while fresh, at a reasonable cost. That failure killed the McD\u2019s partnership. As the JP Morgan analyst noted: \u201cThe reality is this donut has nearly all of its appeal when eaten freshly fried & glazed within minutes of being made.\u201d\n\u2022 Who said Love can\u2019t buy you money? It wasn\u2019t Phil Collins, was it? Still, news that Taylor Swift was engaged to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce boosted shares in some surprising stocks. Signet Jewelers $SIG rose more than 7%, Ralph Lauren $RL , whose clothes both were wearing in photos was flat, while American Eagle Outfitters $AEO , with which Kelce\u2019s own sportswear brand Tru Kolors has a collab going, rose more than 8%. Meanwhile this is every unmarried guy in a three-year-plus relationship on hearing the news:\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t join \u2018em, beat \u2018em: Frontier Airlines\u2019 $ULCC offers to buy discount rival Spirit $FLYY have been rejected so many times, that it\u2019s now angling to steal Spirit customers by adding some 20 routes aimed at Spirit\u2019s main markets, including Ft. Lauderdale. Spirit is still trying to restructure, but that\u2019s looking a lot more like a garage sale, with planes and gates up for bids. Spirit had projected a $252 million profit this year, but it\u2019s already lost $256 million from mid-March through June.\n\u2022 Can Hooters make a comeback? That\u2019s the aim of a Hooters franchisee named Neil Kiefer, who\u2019s trying to convince a Chicago bankruptcy court to let him manage the chain\u2019s 100 or so bankrupt locations. Kiefer says he wants to downgrade the licentiousness and make Hooters \u201cfamily-friendly,\u201d while still keeping it \u201cdelightfully tacky.\u201d Part of his plan: Banning bikini bottoms and lengthening the servers\u2019 shorts by about an inch.\n\nGet Big Business This Week in your inbox every week\u2014and read it before everybody else! Sign up today.\n\u2022 Search results: AI startup Perplexity says it will pay media companies each time its search engine uses a news article to answer a request. The micropayments will come from subscriptions to Perplexity\u2019s Comet Plus. Publishers want to be paid for letting their words train AI models, and last year Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones, part of News Corp $NWSA sued Perplexity for copyright infringement. The perplexity arrangement could signal a new model to provide compensation for content. Hey Grok, should content be free? \u201cA hybrid makes sense: free access to basic or essential content, with premium options for specialized or high-effort work. Total freedom sounds nice until you realize someone\u2019s gotta pay the bills.\u201d\n\u2022 Apple Radio goes out-of-app: Apple\u2019s $AAPL six curated radio stations will be available on non-Apple devices for the first time, as the tech giant tries to catch up with Spotify $SPOT . Apple\u2019s market share of digital music subscribers in the U.S. fell to 25% at the end of last year from 30% in 2020, while Spotify\u2019s share grew to 37% from 31%. The deal will put the Apple stations on TuneIn, which has 75 million monthly active users.\n\u2022 The Apprentice: Fed Chair Edition: \u201cYou\u2019re Fired!\u201d That\u2019s what Donald Trump said to Fed governor Lisa Cook, but Cook says there\u2019s no valid grounds to fire her, and on Thursday sued Trump in federal court to block her sacking. The suit sets up a landmark legal battle over the independence of the Fed, and the limits of executive power. Trump wants to people the Fed with his own supporters, who would presumably do his bidding on interest rates and bank regulation.\n\u2022 Tarifftown: Remember that $550 billion Pres. Trump said Japan would invest in the U.S., with the White House directing how it\u2019s spent, and the U.S. keeping 90% of the profits? Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick told Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham on Monday night that the deal will be signed this week, and Japan\u2019s investment would be \u201cat the hand of Donald Trump, and he can go invest it.\u201d But that\u2019s not what the Japanese said when the deal was first agreed to. Tokyo\u2019s chief trade negotiator said Japan would offer a mix of investment, loans, and loan guarantees, with no promise that the investments would be new, or under Trump\u2019s control.\n\u2022 The Gilded Age: There\u2019s a new crypto lifeline for Trump\u2019s troubled Trump Media & Technology Group $DJT, which is down 50% since he took office. On Tuesday, the Truth Social owner said online exchange Crypto.com will seed a new joint venture with $1 billion in CRO tokens, a form of cryptocurrency it created, while Yorkville Advisers will provide a $5 billion line of credit to acquire about $6.4 billion of CRO tokens. It\u2019s not clear where either the line of credit or the profit will come from, but it\u2019s notable that Trump Media said it will buy $150 million in CRO tokens, while Crypto.com will purchase $50 million in Trump Media stock, the only part of the transaction that appears to be made with cash.\n\u2022 Tenth times\u2019 a charm: A tenth launch of SpaceX\u2019s 403-foot-tall Starship rocket made it successfully to orbit, where it released a bunch of dummy satellites, as engineers carried out a stress test of the often-problematic launch vehicle. Musk wants the Starship to take a payload to Mars next year.\n\u2022 Not as I do: While Musk has been suing Sam Altman for turning OpenAI into a for-profit corporation after Musk helped launch it as a non-profit, he quietly changed the status of xAI from a Nevada public benefit corporation into a simple for-profit firm. Meanwhile, on Monday, Musk ratcheted up his attack on OpenAI, alleging in a lawsuit in Texas that Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI to power AI on Apple devices is a \u201cmonopolistic collaboration\u201d that disadvantages xAI\u2019s Grok. Apple\u2019s 65% share of the US smartphone market and OpenAI\u2019s 85% share of the AI chatbot market makes a collaboration between the two monopolistic, Musk said.",

  "summary": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, known for his visionary talk and work ethic, has caused concern among investors about the close relationship between him and the company, which is making cars and promising to create the next industrial revolution. Despite this, sales have dropped and the share price has risen by 65% in the past year. Howard Yu, the Lego professor of management and innovation at IMD Business School in Lausanne, suggests that while Musk's focus is usually focused on scientific breakthroughs or unparalleled service to customers, he may be distracted by politics. Yu also suggests that Musk should delegate some of his day-to-day operations to a successor, building a strong bench of competent managers and seeking a Tim Cook. Yu suggests that if Musk becomes incapacitated, Tesla could collapse forever due to his personal insecurity, which could lead to a collapse of the company. He also discusses the potential impact of Google's $20B annual advertising monopoly on Apple devices and other major tech companies.",
  "shortSummary": "Elon Musk's rise and visionary work ethic have led to challenges for Tesla, with plummeting sales, and a need to find competent managers to lead the company.",

      "text": "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Secures Unprecedented U.S.\u2013Japan Strategic Trade and Investment Agreement\nA HISTORIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN: Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump announced a landmark economic agreement with Japan\u2014one of America\u2019s closest allies and most important trading partners.\n- This historic deal reflects the strength of the U.S.\u2013Japan relationship and Japan\u2019s recognition of the United States as the most attractive and secure destination for strategic investment in the world.\n- The agreement reaffirms the shared commitment of both nations to economic prosperity, industrial leadership, and long-term security. It delivers a powerful signal that the U.S.\u2013Japan alliance is not only a cornerstone of peace in the Indo-Pacific, but also a driver of global growth and innovation.\n- With over $550 billion in a new Japanese/USA investment vehicle and enhanced access for American exports, this agreement marks a new chapter in bilateral cooperation\u2014one that will unleash the full potential of the U.S. economy, strengthen vital supply chains, and support American workers, communities, and businesses for decades to come.\nRESTORING AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL POWER: Japan will invest $550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries.\n- This is the single largest foreign investment commitment ever secured by any country and will generate hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.\n- At President Trump\u2019s direction, these funds will be targeted toward the revitalization of America\u2019s strategic industrial base, including:\n- Energy infrastructure and production, including LNG, advanced fuels, and grid modernization;\n- Semiconductor manufacturing and research, rebuilding U.S. capacity from design to fabrication;\n- Critical minerals mining, processing, and refining, ensuring access to essential inputs;\n- Pharmaceutical and medical production, ending U.S. dependence on foreign-made medicines and supplies;\n- Commercial and defense shipbuilding, including new yards and modernization of existing facilities.\n- The United States will retain 90% of the profits from this investment\u2014ensuring that American workers, taxpayers, and communities reap the overwhelming share of the benefit.\n- This capital surge, combined with the trillions already secured under President Trump\u2019s leadership, will be a key component of a once-in-a-century industrial revival.\nENSURING BALANCED TRADE THROUGH A PREDICTABLE TARIFF FRAMEWORK: As part of this agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate.\n- In addition to raising billions in revenue, this new tariff framework, combined with expanded U.S. exports and investment-driven production, will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall U.S. trade position.\n- This approach reflects the United States\u2019 broader effort to establish a consistent, transparent, and enforceable trade environment\u2014one in which American workers and producers are no longer disadvantaged by outdated or one-sided trade rules.\n- By aligning with this framework, Japan affirms the strength and mutual respect of the U.S.\u2013Japan economic relationship and recognizes the importance of durable trade grounded in fairness.\nSECURING INCREASED MARKET ACCESS FOR AMERICAN PRODUCERS: For decades, U.S. companies have faced barriers when seeking access to Japan\u2019s market. This agreement delivers breakthrough openings across key sectors:\n- Agriculture and Food:\n- Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with a major expansion of import quotas;\n- Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.\n- Energy:\n- Major expansion of U.S. energy exports to Japan;\n- The US and Japan are exploring a new offtake agreement for Alaskan liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n- Manufacturing and Aerospace:\n- Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft, including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft;\n- Additional billions of dollars annually of purchases of U.S. defense equipment, enhancing interoperability and alliance security in the Indo-Pacific.\n- Automobiles and Industrial Goods:\n- Longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks will be lifted, granting U.S. automakers access to the Japanese consumer market; U.S. Automotive standards will be approved in Japan for the first time ever.\n- Broader openings for a range of industrial and consumer goods, leveling the playing field for American producers.\nA GENERATIONAL SHIFT IN U.S.-JAPAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS: This agreement is not merely a trade deal\u2014it is a strategic realignment of the U.S.-Japan economic relationship delivering for the American people.\n- For the first time, the terms of engagement place American industry, innovation, and labor at the center.\n- By securing historic investment and breaking open long-closed markets, President Trump has once again delivered a deal that no one else could deliver\u2014a deal that will help to rebuild the American economy, strengthen our industrial foundation, and safeguard our national strength for decades to come.\n- President Trump is proving that when the United States leads from strength, the world follows\u2014and America wins.\nSECURING LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP: This agreement reflects the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Japan, and it advances the mutual interests of both nations.\n- By aligning on economic and national security, energy reliability, and reciprocal trade, the agreement establishes a foundation for shared prosperity, industrial resilience, and technological leadership.\n- President Trump has once again delivered a transformative outcome for the American people\u2014ensuring that our workers, producers, and innovators are rewarded, respected, and empowered in the global economy."

      "text": "Bankrupt Spirit Airlines said it turned down a new merger offer from rival budget carrier Frontier Airlines.\nFrontier said Wednesday that it has met with Spirit's board and executives since it made its debt-and-stock merger proposal on Jan. 7. Frontier executives said in a email to counterparts at Spirit this week that their plan is better than Spirit's own plan to emerge from bankruptcy.\n\"We continue to believe that under the current standalone plan, Spirit will emerge highly levered, losing money at the operating level, and this would not be a transaction we would pursue,\" wrote Frontier Chairman Bill Franke and CEO Barry Biffle in a Tuesday email to Spirit Chairman Mac Gardner and CEO Ted Christie. \"As a result, time is of the essence.\"\nChristie and Gardner told their Frontier counterparts that they were rejecting the offer, calling the terms \"inadequate and unactionable,\" according to a letter shared in a securities filing on Wednesday.\nFrontier's new merger plan offered Spirit's debtors $400 million and a 19% stake in Frontier. It also proposed Spirit creditors provide $350 million in new funding, Spirit said.\nThe Spirit executives called Frontier's proposal \"risky and costly, with no certainty as to either timing or outcome\" and \"woefully insufficient financially.\"\nThey said, however, that they would consider a sweetened offer.\n\"Should you wish to make a revised proposal that is in fact capable of closing, and addresses the material deficiencies catalogued here and in our many communications, we would be happy to consider it and again work to activate our stakeholders to do so as well,\" they wrote.\nThe two carriers were in talks for a possible combination before Spirit filed for bankruptcy.\nFrontier and Spirit first announced a deal to merge in 2022, but a higher JetBlue Airways all-cash offer derailed that plan. JetBlue's planned acquisition of Spirit was blocked by a federal judge last year, and Spirit filed for bankruptcy protection in November.\nIn both deals, the airlines argued they needed to combine to better compete against larger rivals.\nSpirit said it expects to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy this quarter and has a Feb. 13 court date to finalize its plan, which wipes out debtor shareholders. It has raced to cut costs in recent months, including by slashing some 200 jobs and selling some of its Airbus planes.\nBudget carriers like Frontier and Spirit have struggled post-pandemic, as costs like salaries have risen and consumers have opted for trips abroad on carriers with options for roomier and more expensive seats. Larger rivals that control much of the U.S. market have also made inroads with basic economy fares, which aim to compete with the bare-bones tickets that were at one time the backbone of Frontier and Spirit.\nSpirit has also been particularly challenged by a Pratt & Whitney engine recall that grounded dozens of its jets.\nBoth Frontier and Spirit have been working to upend their business models that were marked by low fares and fees for add-ons from seat assignments to cabin baggage.\nThe airlines last year did away with cancellation and change fees for some of their tickets and started bundling perks along with tickets. Frontier last year said it would start offering a premium section at the front of the plane."

      "text": "Elon Musk may not have founded Tesla, but he has become the company, and it\u2019s become him. Now sales are plummeting, and while the share price is up 65% in the past year, investors are concerned about the close link between Musk, with his multiple projects and controversial political stands, and a company that makes cars and promises to create the next industrial revolution. To understand what Musk must do next, BBTW editor Peter Green spoke with Howard Yu, the Lego professor of management and innovation at IMD Business School in Lausanne.\nMusk made Tesla $TSLA what it is, with his visionary talk and insane work ethic. But in 2025, is he still good for Tesla, or is he toxic?\nThat visionary talk and insane work ethic are okay in my mind. Nvidia $NVDA and Taiwan Semiconductor $TSM are also insane on the work ethic front. What is less desirable is when the CEO\u2019s focus is less about chasing purely scientific breakthroughs or unparalleled service to customers, but instead they get distracted by politics and don\u2019t seem able to focus. Then we have a problem.\nWhat are the biggest challenges facing Tesla now, and how would you, as a management guru, advise Musk to handle them?\nFind a successor. Delegate stuff he doesn\u2019t like, just as he does with SpaceX. Build a strong bench of competent managers. If he\u2019s Steve Jobs, he\u2019ll also need a Tim Cook.\nDo you think Musk can accept that he will need strong leaders at Tesla to guide the company forward?\nNope. That\u2019s his personality. Maybe he\u2019ll learn. Again, he did so at SpaceX. But we haven\u2019t yet seen him moving in that direction for Tesla so far. Perhaps he\u2019s running into a wall when it comes to attracting top-level, world-class, big-name talent.\nWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge facing Tesla now?\nRolling out the robotaxi. If you cannot get Robotaxi, how can anybody trust you can do a humanoid robot? So that would be a not-too-distant-future test that Elon Musk is facing.\nDoes Musk have the detail-oriented enthusiasm needed to run Tesla as a car company?\nHe\u2019s just not interested in that part. But what he\u2019s interested in, of course, is AI, maybe potentially taking over OpenAI, continuing to accelerate Grok, and continuing to go into humanoids. So, in the ideal world, he would be able to delegate, just like at SpaceX, the day-to-day operations to someone to just run Tesla.\nBut you never want your company to be led by an irreplaceable man?\nThat is the Tesla conundrum: at some point, you need to pass the torch to the next generation. Other companies that stay relevant over centuries develop generational leaders. And Elon Musk, because of his personal insecurity, you can read this in his biography, he appears to feel that when he becomes dispensable, that threatens his own self-worth.\nIf Elon Musk has a stroke tomorrow, or just does too much Ketamine, is that the collapse of Tesla forever?\nThat would be a setback. Which are the companies that have gone through maturity and a new generation of managers? Microsoft has gone through that, Google has gone through that, Tesla has not. If something happened to Elon, even when he has put the company on a path to success, because of the sheer persona he imposed on the company, there\u2019s no way that Tesla\u2019s not going to suffer for a few years. And if deep down in the organization, there\u2019s no one really able to figure it out as a CEO, it would be gone forever.\nOkay. So buy, hold, sell?\nDon\u2019t increase the exposure, but just hold.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for brevity and clarity.\n\u2014Peter S. Green\nWatch Big Business This Week on Cheddar\u2014and YouTube!\nBig Businesses Mentioned This Week\n$TSLA ( \u25bc 1.37% ) $NVDA ( \u25bc 0.88% ) $TSM ( \u25bc 0.14% ) $GOOGL ( \u25b2 2.16% ) $AAPL ( \u25b2 1.21% ) $XOM ( \u25b2 0.48% ) $KDP ( \u25bc 1.11% ) $CBRL ( \u25bc 4.24% ) $AMZN ( \u25b2 1.1% ) $WMT ( \u25b2 0.31% ) $COST ( \u25bc 0.12% ) $MCD ( \u25b2 0.08% ) $DNUT ( \u25bc 1.53% ) $JPM ( \u25b2 0.41% ) $SIG ( \u25bc 3.25% ) $RL ( \u25b2 0.78% ) $AEO ( \u25bc 1.02% ) $ULCC ( \u25bc 0.73% ) $FLYY ( \u25bc 7.25% ) $NWSA ( \u25bc 0.81% ) $SPOT ( \u25bc 1.25% ) $DJT ( \u25b2 0.42% ) $YORKU ( \u25b2 7.79% )\nThe usual suspects\n- Google, Apple, and the domino effect: Sometime soon U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta will decide on a remedy for Google\u2019s illegal monopoly on Internet search and ads. At the heart of the dilemma is the $20 billion a year that Google parent Alphabet $GOOGL pays Apple $AAPL to make Google the default search engine on all Apple devices, directing many more billions of dollars in search ad revenue to Google. It sure looked like curtains for Google\u2019s endless cash stream. But the impending dominance of AI results in internet search may have completely shifted the paradigm: Now it\u2019s Apple that could see its pre-tax profit crash 7% and Google that could save 20% of its cash flow, freed from expensive arrangements that are suddenly yielding less demand. And that still might not help consumers escape the monopoly: Microsoft\u2019s 20-year, $100 billion bet on Bing has only yielded a 7.65% market share to Google\u2019s 86%.\n- Exxon\u2019s Russia Play: Oil giant Exxon Mobil $XOM has met with senior Russian energy officials to revive a joint venture to pump oil and gas from fields off Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, the Wall Street Journal reports. Washington has allowed U.S. companies to talk with Russia about assets left there when sanctions were imposed after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Letting Exxon back in as part of a peace deal has been part of on-again, off-again talks with Russia. Exxon wrote off its Russia stake for $4 billion, and wants to get that back.\n- Nvidia Envy? The world\u2019s most valuable public company did it again: Posting record sales of $46.7 billion in the quarter ending in July, with net income of $26.4 billion up 59% from a year ago. Still, Nvidia $NVDA shares dropped 3% in aftermarket trading as the company said the China-U.S. trade war could hit sales in the second half of the year, and as analysts worry the rush to build AI computing centers may stall, stymied by a lack of electrical power, and uncertain demand as dozens of new data hubs come online at once. That could crimp demand for Nvidia\u2019s famous AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang said he sees companies spending $3 trillion to $4 trillion over the next five years on AI chips, and expects to capture about a third of that.\n- Peet\u2019s coffee joins an original crowd. Look around these days and there is definitely a Dr. Pepper craze. Keurig Dr Pepper $KDP is buying Peets for about $18 billion. Keurig Dr Pepper, the coffee and fizzy drink firm created in 2018 when the OG soft drink owner was bought by the original coffee pod maker, hasn\u2019t been doing well, as the coffee industry is losing its buzz from a grande mix of factors: Soaring bean prices, up 49% so far this year, a climate-led 18% decline in Brazilian coffee production from last year, and a 50% Trump tariff on Brazilian imports. Keurig says it plans to split its coffee business from soda (it also owns 7-Up and Snapple), and complete the deal in the first half of 2026. Shares dropped about 18% on the news.\n- The Cracker\u2019s back: Cracker Barrel $CBRL is bringing back the old guy. A streamlined design for the roadside rest stop\u2019s iconic logo went over about as well as New Coke, with President Donald Trump urging the chain to \u201cadmit a mistake,\u201d and revert to the old logo. \u201cThey got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right,\u201d Trump posted on his own social media platform, for 42,000 likes. \u201cWe said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our \u201cOld Timer\u201d will remain,\u201d Cracker Barrel tweeted, to 227,000 likes. Shares in Cracker Barrel dropped 9% on the new logo\u2019s announcement, but are now 4.4% higher than before the kerfuffle began.\n- This clock don\u2019t Tok: The deadline for Chinese-owned TikTok to find a U.S. buyer will probably be pushed back from mid-September, as talks to find a new owner drag on. Trump says he has \u201cvery substantial American buyers\u201d lined up, and the White House also launched its own TikTok channel.\n- You Got Amazoned: Corporate employees at Whole Foods are losing their supermarket discount and other perks, including four weeks of annual work-from-home, under a plan that will see them get new job offers from Whole Foods parent Amazon $AMZN. Since Amazon paid $13.7 billion for Whole Foods in 2017, sales are up more than 40%, but market share is down as Walmart $WMT and Costco $COST grab more grocery dollars.\nThe short stack\n- Hot Soon? After a failed partnership with McDonald\u2019s $MCD , Krispy Kreme $DNUT is taking its oversugared donuts to big box retailers, including Costco $COST and Walmart $WMT (them, again?!), in an effort to rebuild the brand. Shares have dropped 66% in the past year, and sales dropped 13.4% in the last quarter. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase $JPM downgraded Krispy Kreme this week, as shares dropped 3.49% on Wednesday. The problem bedeviling Krispy Kreme? Getting their donuts to the store while fresh, at a reasonable cost. That failure killed the McD\u2019s partnership. As the JP Morgan analyst noted: \u201cThe reality is this donut has nearly all of its appeal when eaten freshly fried & glazed within minutes of being made.\u201d\n- Who said Love can\u2019t buy you money? It wasn\u2019t Phil Collins, was it? Still, news that Taylor Swift was engaged to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce boosted shares in some surprising stocks. Signet Jewelers $SIG rose more than 7%, Ralph Lauren $RL , whose clothes both were wearing in photos was flat, while American Eagle Outfitters $AEO , with which Kelce\u2019s own sportswear brand Tru Kolors has a collab going, rose more than 8%. Meanwhile this is every unmarried guy in a three-year-plus relationship on hearing the news:\n- If you can\u2019t join \u2018em, beat \u2018em: Frontier Airlines\u2019 $ULCC offers to buy discount rival Spirit $FLYY have been rejected so many times, that it\u2019s now angling to steal Spirit customers by adding some 20 routes aimed at Spirit\u2019s main markets, including Ft. Lauderdale. Spirit is still trying to restructure, but that\u2019s looking a lot more like a garage sale, with planes and gates up for bids. Spirit had projected a $252 million profit this year, but it\u2019s already lost $256 million from mid-March through June.\n- Can Hooters make a comeback? That\u2019s the aim of a Hooters franchisee named Neil Kiefer, who\u2019s trying to convince a Chicago bankruptcy court to let him manage the chain\u2019s 100 or so bankrupt locations. Kiefer says he wants to downgrade the licentiousness and make Hooters \u201cfamily-friendly,\u201d while still keeping it \u201cdelightfully tacky.\u201d Part of his plan: Banning bikini bottoms and lengthening the servers\u2019 shorts by about an inch.\nGet Big Business This Week in your inbox every week\u2014and read it before everybody else! Sign up today.\nThe media mirror\n- Search results: AI startup Perplexity says it will pay media companies each time its search engine uses a news article to answer a request. The micropayments will come from subscriptions to Perplexity\u2019s Comet Plus. Publishers want to be paid for letting their words train AI models, and last year Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones, part of News Corp $NWSA sued Perplexity for copyright infringement. The perplexity arrangement could signal a new model to provide compensation for content. Hey Grok, should content be free? \u201cA hybrid makes sense: free access to basic or essential content, with premium options for specialized or high-effort work. Total freedom sounds nice until you realize someone\u2019s gotta pay the bills.\u201d\n- Apple Radio goes out-of-app: Apple\u2019s $AAPL six curated radio stations will be available on non-Apple devices for the first time, as the tech giant tries to catch up with Spotify $SPOT . Apple\u2019s market share of digital music subscribers in the U.S. fell to 25% at the end of last year from 30% in 2020, while Spotify\u2019s share grew to 37% from 31%. The deal will put the Apple stations on TuneIn, which has 75 million monthly active users.\nTrumplandia\n- The Apprentice: Fed Chair Edition: \u201cYou\u2019re Fired!\u201d That\u2019s what Donald Trump said to Fed governor Lisa Cook, but Cook says there\u2019s no valid grounds to fire her, and on Thursday sued Trump in federal court to block her sacking. The suit sets up a landmark legal battle over the independence of the Fed, and the limits of executive power. Trump wants to people the Fed with his own supporters, who would presumably do his bidding on interest rates and bank regulation.\n- Tarifftown: Remember that $550 billion Pres. Trump said Japan would invest in the U.S., with the White House directing how it\u2019s spent, and the U.S. keeping 90% of the profits? Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick told Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham on Monday night that the deal will be signed this week, and Japan\u2019s investment would be \u201cat the hand of Donald Trump, and he can go invest it.\u201d But that\u2019s not what the Japanese said when the deal was first agreed to. Tokyo\u2019s chief trade negotiator said Japan would offer a mix of investment, loans, and loan guarantees, with no promise that the investments would be new, or under Trump\u2019s control.\n- The Gilded Age: There\u2019s a new crypto lifeline for Trump\u2019s troubled Trump Media & Technology Group $DJT, which is down 50% since he took office. On Tuesday, the Truth Social owner said online exchange Crypto.com will seed a new joint venture with $1 billion in CRO tokens, a form of cryptocurrency it created, while Yorkville Advisers will provide a $5 billion line of credit to acquire about $6.4 billion of CRO tokens. It\u2019s not clear where either the line of credit or the profit will come from, but it\u2019s notable that Trump Media said it will buy $150 million in CRO tokens, while Crypto.com will purchase $50 million in Trump Media stock, the only part of the transaction that appears to be made with cash.\nElon\u2019s world\n- Tenth times\u2019 a charm: A tenth launch of SpaceX\u2019s 403-foot-tall Starship rocket made it successfully to orbit, where it released a bunch of dummy satellites, as engineers carried out a stress test of the often-problematic launch vehicle. Musk wants the Starship to take a payload to Mars next year.\n- Not as I do: While Musk has been suing Sam Altman for turning OpenAI into a for-profit corporation after Musk helped launch it as a non-profit, he quietly changed the status of xAI from a Nevada public benefit corporation into a simple for-profit firm. Meanwhile, on Monday, Musk ratcheted up his attack on OpenAI, alleging in a lawsuit in Texas that Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI to power AI on Apple devices is a \u201cmonopolistic collaboration\u201d that disadvantages xAI\u2019s Grok. Apple\u2019s 65% share of the US smartphone market and OpenAI\u2019s 85% share of the AI chatbot market makes a collaboration between the two monopolistic, Musk said.\nPeter S.
