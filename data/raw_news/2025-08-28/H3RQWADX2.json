  "content": "The Athletic FC \u26bd is The Athletic\u2019s daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.\n\nHello! They only sing when they\u2019re fishing. And last night, Grimsby Town caught a big one.\n\nOn the way:\n\nGrimsby Town, take a bow. I\u2019m getting that in straight away because a) it\u2019s what they should be doing and b) The Athletic\u2019s chief is a paid-up Grimsby fan. I know which side my bread is buttered on.\n\nBut Manchester United? Take a pew and repent after a Carabao Cup defeat you\u2019ll be hearing about for a while. I\u2019m not sure if it ranks as their ultimate humiliation but at the very least, it\u2019s moved in next door. Upsets happen, granted. This one, at a rainswept Blundell Park on Wednesday night, was painfully inexcusable.\n\nGrimsby, from an isolated fishing port halfway up England\u2019s east coast, are making a decent early-season dent near the top of League Two, but they\u2019re a League Two team nonetheless, three divisions and more than sixty places beneath United in the English football pyramid. Their second-round victory over them yesterday was the night of their lives. They fought for it and deserved it. United blundering their way to an epic penalty shootout only prolonged the fun.\n\nThe result itself isn\u2019t the issue for United head coach Ruben Amorim. The problem is the nature of the loss for a side who were supposedly undergoing a comprehensive and future-defining reset. Look back at Laurie Whitwell\u2019s season preview and take note of the phrase which one employee at Old Trafford used to describe 2025-26: \u201cNow or never\u201d. The implication was that if a summer rebuild under Amorim didn\u2019t work, United\u2019s longer-term decline might be irreversible.\n\nSo how\u2019s that going? A home defeat to Arsenal on Premier League matchday one. A draw at Fulham on Premier League matchday two. And now an unmitigated screw-up at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. \u201cI\u2018ve nothing to say,\u201d said Amorim afterwards. \u201cNothing to say.\u201d There\u2019s a man going back to square one, United\u2019s perennial home.\n\nSometimes, Premier League bosses play second strings in these early rounds of the Carabao Cup, or treat it in a way which invites defeat. That wasn\u2019t true of Amorim\u2019s line-up. He had Benjamin Sesko (\u00a366.4m) up front. He had Matheus Cunha (\u00a362.5m) tucked in behind. Bryan Mbeumo (\u00a365m) came off the bench, only to hit the crossbar with the decisive penalty in a shootout which required 26 spot kicks to settle it.\n\nIn other words, Amorim didn\u2019t go weak and the recurrence of familiar failings left everybody asking \u2014 albeit at an early stage of the term \u2014 what\u2019s really changed? Goalkeeper Andre Onana continues to make more mistakes than a teenager on his first holiday in Magaluf. His fumble at a corner contributed to a 2-0 deficit at half-time. By the latter stages, United were back to praying for centre-half-cum-striker Harry Maguire to dig them out of a hole, which he did with a headed equaliser on 89 minutes, but it was a temporary reprieve.\n\nOnly twice in the previous 30 years had United hit the buffers in round two of England\u2019s second-tier cup competition. Grimsby milked their moment with a good, old-fashioned pitch invasion, above (and quite right too) as Amorim picked up the pieces. Weirdly, he hid in his dugout while the penalties played out and chose not to watch them. You might think that\u2019s something of nothing, but the optics weren\u2019t ideal.\n\n\u201cSomething has to change, and you\u2019re not going to change 22 players again,\u201d Amorim said, as if fortunes at Old Trafford weren\u2019t supposed to have changed by now. \u201cThe players and team spoke really loud today. We lost, the best team won.\u201d I\u2019ve no idea what that means but, in a now-or-never year, it doesn\u2019t sound great.\n\u2022 The Leagues Cup final will feature Inter Miami after \u2014 yes, you guessed it \u2014 Lionel Messi kept the wolf from the door. Miami trailed 1-0 to Orlando City last night when the latter\u2019s David Brekalo was sent off in the 75th minute. Messi then scored twice (check his sweet feet, above) and a 3-1 victory ensued. Seattle Sounders edged out LA Galaxy in the other semi.\n\u2022 Serie A is pushing every bit as hard as La Liga to take an official league game abroad. It\u2019s trying to line up a clash between Milan and Como for Perth, Australia, in February, saying the Italian game would gain \u201cincreased visibility and popularity worldwide\u201d.\n\u2022 Milan, meanwhile, have agreed a \u00a336.2m fee with Chelsea for Christopher Nkunku. A lot of time was spent \u2018exploring\u2019 deals for Nkunku this summer. Finally somebody is biting the bullet.\n\u2022 Despite being estranged from Newcastle United, Alexander Isak has been called up by Sweden for World Cup qualifiers next month. If the Swedish media pin him down for a chat, I\u2019m fascinated to see what he says \u2014 and if he\u2019s still a Newcastle player at that point.\n\u2022 There was one space left in Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s September USMNT squad, and it\u2019s gone to Folarin Balogun.\n\u2022 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has officially severed his contract with Turkish club Besiktas a year early. Keep eyes on this, because Tom Brady\u2019s Birmingham City are keen on him.\n\nOff to Scotland now, where Glasgow\u2019s finest \u2014 Rangers and their dear friends Celtic \u2014 are proving that inexcusable isn\u2019t an adjective reserved for Manchester United.\n\nPut bluntly, the past 24 hours are as bad as it has ever been for Scottish football in the Champions League. Celtic went first on Tuesday, losing to Kazakhstan\u2019s Kairat Almaty without scoring once over 210 minutes. Rangers followed yesterday, trounced 6-0 by Club Brugge on the night and 9-1 on aggregate. It\u2019s what us Scots would call a dull yin (sore one).\n\nTime was when Celtic would have seen a tie against a team from Kazakhstan as a gimme. Time was when either of the country\u2019s big two would have ranked themselves on a par with Belgian football or a side like Club Brugge. Neither of those presumptions stacks up any longer.\n\nNo rest for the wicked, however, because amusingly, Sunday coming is the date of the season\u2019s first Old Firm derby. These two clubs loathe each other, famously. This weekend might be a rare moment where they loathe themselves more.\n\u2022 NB: I\u2019m aware that as a result of their liquidation in 2012, some people think the original Rangers no longer exist (and, therefore, neither does \u2018the Old Firm\u2019). I\u2019m also aware that others think Rangers are the same entity they\u2019ve always been, and that \u2018the Old Firm\u2019 is alive and well. Just to spare us all from a torturous exchange of emails.\n\nChampions League draw: A self-help guide and how the teams stack up\n\nRangers\u2019 annihilation combined with results elsewhere, including a defeat for Fenerbahce which means no Jose Mourinho in the Champions League this season (sad face), completes the line-up for UEFA\u2019s top-tier club competition.\n\nAs with last season\u2019s revamped format, it\u2019s a 36-team tournament and with the league-stage draw coming later today (5pm UK time, noon on America\u2019s east coast \u2014 we\u2019ve got a live blog on the go) it might be worth refreshing yourselves about how it all works. Lots of games and lots of money is the basic vibe.\n\nNick Miller and Tim Spiers got in the mood by ranking all of the participants (they\u2019re calling Paris Saint-Germain to retain their title) and it saddened me slightly to see Inter down in 11th place. TAFC banged the drum for them in 2024-25, and just about called it right. But with the Simone Inzaghi era over and the men from the San Siro in transition, they won\u2019t come again. Or not this time.\n\u2022 In amongst all the chat about Christian Pulisic and squad choices, comments from Mauricio Pochettino about Major League Soccer went under the radar. He was complimentary and questioned whether MLS players ought to be angling for moves to Europe. Jeff Rueter reports.\n\u2022 An extensive survey in the U.S. has underlined both the increasing pull of women\u2019s soccer and the mounting success of brands attached to that side of the sport. Asli Pelit cut through the results.\n\u2022 There\u2019s loads to be had from David Ornstein\u2019s transfer updates on The Athletic FC Podcast. The deadline for Premier League sides is just around the corner (September 1) so the next few days are going to be hot. Listen on Apple and Spotify.\n\u2022 Most clicked in Wednesday\u2019s TAFC: \u2018The Gyokeres\u2019, as it shall be known from now on.\n\nProps to Michael Walker for his intro today:\n\n\u2018The Newcastle centre-forward pursued by Liverpool thought it would be a good idea to remove himself from the limelight. The situation was increasingly tense. The Liverpool Echo was running an hour-by-hour analysis of the proposed transfer sensation. So the wanted and \u2018wantaway\u2019 striker went somewhere no one could see him \u2014 the cinema.\u2019\n\nLike me, you\u2019re thinking Alexander Isak. But no, this is Albert Stubbins in 1946, with deep echoes of a modern-day transfer saga. Stubbins got his move to Liverpool in the end. He made it onto the cover of The Beatles\u2019 most iconic album too (see above). Isak would gladly settle for the first half of that bargain.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Love TAFC?

The loss was not the only issue for United, but the nature of the loss was the magnitude of it. Despite a strong start to the season, United's head coach Ruben Amorim remains hopeful about a significant turnaround. The team's performance was criticised by fans and managers alike, with goalkeeper Andre Onana making more mistakes than a teenager on his first holiday in Magaluf. The Leagues Cup final will feature Lionel Messi in Miami, but it doesn't sound great if Lionel Messi's Barcelona team wins.",

      "text": "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nThe Brazil international, 26, moves after United met the \u00a362.5million ($83.7m) release clause in his contract at Molineux.\nHe has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford with the option of a further year.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player,\u201d Cunha said. \u201cEver since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother\u2019s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt. I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my teammates and prepare for the season ahead. All my focus is now on working hard to become a valuable part of the team, and helping get this club back to the top.\u201d\nJason Wilcox, the club\u2019s newly-appointed director of football, added: \u201cBringing in Matheus was one of our main priorities for this summer, so we are delighted to have completed his signing so early in the window.\n\u201cHe has proved his ability to succeed in the Premier League as one of the most exciting and productive forwards in England during his time at Wolves, and before that in Spain and Germany. He has all the qualities we are looking for as we seek to build a strong, dynamic and entertaining team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\u201d\nUnited prioritised a move for the forward this summer as they bid to bolster their front line, after Bruno Fernandes and Amad finished as the club\u2019s top scorers in the Premier League last season with just eight goals each.\nCunha registered 17 goals in 36 matches in all competitions during the 2024-25 campaign, the most productive season of his career, despite missing six games through suspension.\n\u2018Versatility, creativity, and goalscoring ability\u2019\nAnalysis by Mark Carey\nPushing his temperament to one side for a moment, there is little doubt that Cunha was Wolves\u2019 talisman this past season. Having barely played as an out-and-out striker, a return of 15 Premier League goals shows how much he has shouldered the attacking responsibility to help his side stave off relegation.\nAdvertisement\nPlaying as a left-sided No 10, Cunha\u2019s intelligence to drift into pockets of space will often mean that all attacking roads lead through the Brazil international. As well as his goal haul, no Wolves player created more open-play chances or generated a higher expected assists tally. Ideally, you would clone Cunha and play them both \u2014 one to craft the chance and the other to finish.\nUnited have witnessed his cheeky, South American flair first-hand after Cunha\u2019s Olimpico goal gave Wolves the lead in their Boxing Day clash this season. With Amorim\u2019s side in desperate need of a player to stitch their attack together, Cunha could be the perfect player to link the midfield and forward line \u2014 particularly given that he is adept at playing in a 3-4-2-1 system.\nCapable of playing anywhere across the front line, Cunha offers versatility, creativity, and goalscoring ability. The perfect combination for an elite forward.\nWhy is a new No 10 important for Amorim?\nAnalysis by Manchester United correspondent Laurie Whitwell\nCunha\u2019s familiarity with that position behind the striker in a 3-4-2-1 formation enhances his appeal for United, who want adaptable players but also need new signings to hit the ground running.\nHis record against United inevitably colours perceptions too. He terrorised Erik ten Hag\u2019s side when running from midfield on the opening day of the 2023-24 season and, of course, scored direct from a corner past Andre Onana at Molineux this term.\nCunha\u2019s ball-carrying is an important aspect to consider in an Amorim system. Usually, Amorim has a blend in his No 10s, one a creator, the other tasked with running beyond. Cunha could offer a bit of both, but his ability to go past opponents would add dynamism and, importantly, he can carry a scoring edge.\nThere may be questions about temperament given his bans for reactions against Ipswich Town and Bournemouth, and his work off the ball at Wolves left some staff wanting more.

      "text": "For years, brands\u2019 default narrative for women\u2019s soccer marketing was great stories, inspiring athletes, but commercially unproven. Sponsors stayed conservative, sticking with the NFL, NBA, MLB and men\u2019s soccer, where the math was predictable. Women\u2019s soccer was often seen as a nice-to-have, not a must-have.\nAdvertisement\nNow, the data says otherwise.\nEarlier this summer, Parity, a sports marketing and sponsorship platform focused on professional women athletes across 85 sports, ran a survey on women\u2019s sports fandom in the United States. It sampled 2,400 sports fans across multiple disciplines, finding that 63 percent of respondents said they watch women\u2019s soccer.\nOne in four said they watch only women\u2019s soccer, with 49 percent saying they watch NWSL and 32 percent saying they follow Gainbridge Super League, the other Division I professional league in the U.S.\nThat\u2019s a staggering statistic for both leagues; the NWSL is barely a decade old, and the Super League is only just beginning its second season. But fans are not just watching, they\u2019re investing.\nThe survey found that more than one in four fans of women\u2019s soccer have made a purchase because of a brand\u2019s sponsorship, making them 58 percent more likely to do so compared to fans of other women\u2019s sports.\nTranslation: Women\u2019s soccer fans see sponsorships less as sales pitches and more as solidarity. For brands, that is the holy grail.\n\u201cWe looked at fans in basketball, soccer, volleyball, softball, etc, and we couldn\u2019t believe what we saw for soccer,\u201d Leela Srinivasan, the CEO of Parity, told The Athletic. Since she took the reins in May 2023, Parity has amassed a network of over 1100 women athletes and paid out over $2 million in sponsorships. \u201cIt just stood out head and shoulders above other fandoms or other sports,\u201d Srinivasan said.\nThe culture of soccer is part of the equation.\n\u201cThe passion runs deep in soccer, wherever it\u2019s happening in the world,\u201d explained Srinivasan, who grew up as a season ticket holder for Dundee in the Scottish Premiership. \u201cI think it runs deeper, arguably, in women\u2019s soccer here in the U.S. than in men\u2019s soccer, in part, because the U.S. national team has been such a force for so many years.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat passion has been translated into a commercial engine for a while. The U.S. women\u2019s team attracted a roster of blue-chip sponsors under the U.S. Soccer umbrella: Volkswagen, Allstate, Jim Beam, AT&T, Marriott Bonvoy, Anheuser-Busch, New York Life, Bank of America and The Home Depot are listed as official partners.\n\u201cIn the U.S., it almost feels like soccer is a women\u2019s sport \u2014 we don\u2019t face the same uphill battle that women\u2019s basketball players or soccer players in Europe or South America do,\u201d Angel City defender Ali Riley said. \u201cYes, MLS is growing and there\u2019s huge anticipation for the men\u2019s World Cup, but the success of our women\u2019s national team has made women\u2019s soccer here impossible to ignore.\n\u201cThose players, from the \u201999ers onward, fought for respect and built the foundation we stand on. They didn\u2019t get today\u2019s engagement, loyalty or brand support, but they paved the way \u2014 many now owning clubs, launching businesses and creating opportunities for the next generation.\u201d\nParity also found that women\u2019s soccer fans tend to pay attention to athlete endorsements and are 34 percent more likely than other women\u2019s sports fans to trust athletes \u201ca lot,\u201d according to Parity. Athlete product collabs are the primary way they want to see brands activate, with nearly half saying they would be likely to engage with brands that do so.\n\u201cPeople want to see brands investing more in women\u2019s sports, and the fans are most excited about when brands partner directly with athletes, whether it\u2019s collaborating with products or just building that athlete relationship,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cBecause that unlocks all kinds of storytelling for the brands and helps the fans get closer to the athlete that they still admire.\u201d\nToday\u2019s players are more than athletes; they\u2019re entrepreneurs, activists and culturally relevant voices who no longer wait for a brand to give them a voice or script their image. They are building narratives on social media, and that authenticity is priceless for brands.\nAdvertisement\nWith 11 active brand deals, Riley leads all NWSL players in endorsements, according to Sponsor United\u2019s report. That is notable not just because she\u2019s surpassed her peers, but because she has done it as a non-U.S. women\u2019s national team player, a big contrast to the Alex Morgan era, when Morgan\u2019s 23-deal peak in 2021 defined endorsement dominance. Chasing Riley are Mallory Swanson (10), Sophia Smith (9) and Alyssa Thompson (8), a new generation of stars just steps behind.\n\u201cWith the partnerships I\u2019ve been fortunate to have and the team supporting me, both clubs and players are getting unprecedented exposure,\u201d Riley said. She never felt she could compete with U.S. national team stars like Morgan, but she is doing it. \u201cBack then, it felt like there was just one sponsorship to go around \u2014 Nike, maybe one or two others \u2014 and only a handful of athletes got that support.\n\u201cThat\u2019s finally changing. The data on fan engagement and loyalty is undeniable, and brands are realizing it\u2019s smart business to back us. The pie itself has grown, and now the share we\u2019re competing for is much bigger. On top of that, I\u2019ve got someone advocating for me, pitching my value directly to brands \u2014 and that makes all the difference.\u201d\nIn the 48 hours after the Parity report dropped, the biggest reaction came not from sponsors, but from soccer clubs, according to Srinivasan. They finally had hard data to show brands what they had known all along: Women\u2019s soccer delivers.\nOn the league side, the numbers are even more impressive. Sponsors United, a global sports and entertainment intelligence platform that provides data and insights for marketing partnerships, shared its first NWSL report this year. It shows teams pulled in $75 million in sponsorship revenue last year, with 441 deals across 401 brands in 167 different categories. That is a 16 percent jump in category breadth since 2022. The average team is banking about $5.4 million in sponsorship revenue, with roughly $170,000 per deal.\nOn a per-game basis, NWSL teams are generating more sponsorship revenue than WNBA teams, despite playing fewer games. Still, the money is clustered at the top, with the top three clubs accounting for 46 percent of the league\u2019s sponsorship haul. Angel City FC, which launched in 2022, has the highest sponsorship revenue, followed by Kansas City Current and San Diego Wave.\nGainbridge, the USL Super League\u2019s naming sponsor, sees the potential growth as a big upside.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen traditionally through women\u2019s sports is a lot of brands take a wait-and-see attitude. Sometimes, if you take that wait-and-see attitude, the time never comes. If nobody gets involved, then it doesn\u2019t succeed,\u201d Mike Nichols, chief of sponsorship strategy and activation at Group 1001 (parent company to Gainbridge), said.\nView this post on Instagram\nGainbridge became the title sponsor of the USL Super League this season and sponsors several prominent women\u2019s sports entities, including the Billie Jean King Cup by Gainbridge and the ANNIKA driven by Gainbridge LPGA event. The company allocates over 40 percent of its sponsorship dollars to women\u2019s sports and features a roster of brand ambassadors such as Caitlin Clark, Billie Jean King and former USWNT goalkeeper Briana Scurry.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the financial services space, which is very crowded in the sports ecosystem,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cSo to be in a situation where there was a lot of white space, and as a financial services brand, we could come in and chart our own direction, as opposed to trying to fit in with what\u2019s available, is an incredible opportunity that really doesn\u2019t, frankly, ever present itself, especially if you sort of take a wait-and-see attitude.\n\u201cThe USL has an academy that has over 10,000 kids, boys and girls in it, and those parents are people that we want to ultimately have as our customers. With those sorts of opportunities, we\u2019re just scratching the surface with the league just kicking off.\u201d\nWhile North America is known for its big four men\u2019s leagues, both Parity and SU\u2019s reports underline the steady growth of soccer fandom, and it is not just the game that\u2019s becoming more popular. Parity\u2019s data shows advertising in soccer pays like no other sport, something brands should consider in the lead-up to the upcoming FIFA World Cups and the NWSL and Super League\u2019s combined year-round domestic calendar.\nFans know when game day is. They plan around it. They make it a ritual. Rituals build loyalty, and loyalty builds commerce.\n\u201cSoccer fans in this country have always believed in us, even when games weren\u2019t televised and merchandise didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Riley said. \u201cNow, with brands finally doing the smart thing and backing us, fans are all in. Their appetite has been building for decades, and the response shows just how strong that loyalty really is.\u201d\nThere is also another shift worth noting: visibility.\nAdvertisement\nThe NWSL\u2019s $240 million media rights deal over four years with CBS, ESPN, Amazon\u2019s Prime Video and Scripps Sports represents a forty-fold jump from the NWSL\u2019s previous, $1.5 million annual tie-up with CBS and changed the calculus overnight. For the first time, the deal put 11 games of the season on prime-time cable television, making the sport more attractive to sponsors. In sponsorship math, reach still matters. A player who appears on national TV multiple times a season instantly becomes a safer bet for brand dollars.\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t hurt. If you talk to a head of sponsorship at the brand today and ask them how they measure success, a lot of brands are still going, if not solely, then at least largely, based on number of eyeballs,\u201d Srinivasan explained.\nWhile Parity and Sponsor United\u2019s reports are based on the U.S., soccer is the world\u2019s game.\nThis summer\u2019s UEFA European Women\u2019s Championship broke viewership records among U.S. audiences, and clubs like Barcelona Femen\u00ed and Arsenal FC Women are drawing record crowds into their stadiums. Ownership groups with multi-club portfolios, like Michele Kang\u2019s Kynisca, are increasingly investing in the women\u2019s side, knowing that cross-pollination between markets (U.S., Europe, Mexico) is inevitable.\nEurope\u2019s women\u2019s soccer commercial infrastructure might be behind the U.S., but the momentum is there. As more leagues secure broadcast deals and sponsors step in, the growth curve looks remarkably familiar to what we have seen stateside. In other words, global brands should already be plotting their women\u2019s soccer strategy.\n\u201cAs one of our other brand ambassadors, Billie Jean King, likes to say, \u2018This isn\u2019t charity,\u2019\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWhen she founded the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation 50 years ago with the idea that this day would come where women\u2019s sports would be looked at as a viable business opportunity, not just a charitable thing to do, as opposed to, hey, it\u2019s good for business. And that moment finally came.\u201d\n(Top photo: Spire Motorsports / Gainbridge)"

      "text": "So the Leagues Cup, unloved and uncared for by many, will end with the storyline of Lionel Messi in search of his second winner\u2019s medal in the competition, after the Argentine\u2019s brace took his team past Orlando City with a 3-1 victory in Wednesday\u2019s semifinal at Chase Stadium to set up a final away to the Seattle Sounders.\nAdvertisement\nOn a night in which a subdued Messi, returning from injury, looked far from his best, the World Cup winner found the reserves to turn on the style late in the game and give MLS and broadcaster Apple the stardust they will need for Sunday\u2019s final. The win also cements Miami\u2019s place in next season\u2019s Concacaf Champions Cup, with the top three finishers from the annual MLS-Liga MX competition earning spots in the continental championship (which serves as the region\u2019s pathway to the next FIFA Club World Cup).\nOrlando, which had beaten Miami convincingly in their two Florida derby meetings in MLS this season, led until the 77th minute when a rash decision from their Slovenian defender David Brekalo shifted the momentum decisively.\nJordi Alba crossed from the left flank towards the head of substitute Tadeo Allende and Brekalo blatantly tried to drag the Argentine forward down. Although Allende was still able to head goalwards, the penalty was just, and a second yellow card for Brekalo left the visitors down to 10 men.\nMessi nonchalantly converted the spot kick and suddenly Miami had a belief and energy that they could get the win in 90 minutes and set up a place in Sunday\u2019s final at either the Los Angeles Galaxy or the Seattle Sounders. The Herons did so without manager Javier Mascherano, who was serving a one-game suspension for his actions in the quarterfinals vs. Liga MX\u2019s Tigres but watched the game from the back of the stand.\nMessi buries the PK.

United as he recovered from a minor muscle strain, had been smothered to the point of suffocation at times by a well-organized Orlando defense but with the extra man and tiring legs, he was able to find space to exploit in the latter stages.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI prepared myself to play in this match because I knew how important the opponent was, a very tough opponent who we hadn\u2019t beaten in the matches we faced them this year,\u201d Messi told broadcaster Apple TV, admitting that he hadn\u2019t been at full fitness.\n\u201cI felt a little bit tentative (in the first half) but in the second half I loosened up a bit more,\u201d he added.\nHe certainly did.\nTwo minutes from the end of regulation, the eight-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner seized the moment, cutting across the front of the box in trademark fashion before a \u2018give and go\u2019 with Alba and then lethal drive into the far corner to cancel out Marco Pasalic\u2019s first half opener.\nMESSI MIGHT'VE JUST WON IT.

      "text": "Davide Frattesi\u2019s extra-time winner sent Inter through to the Champions League final at the expense of Barcelona after one of the most epic European ties in history.\nBarca thought they had completed a remarkable comeback against Inter courtesy of an 87th-minute goal from Raphinha. But somehow, the 37-year-old Inter centre-back Francesco Acerbi forced extra time with his finish in the third minute of stoppage time.\nAdvertisement\nInter had taken the lead through Lautaro Martinez in the 21st minute before Hakan Calhanoglu slotted home a 45th-minute penalty following Pau Cubarsi\u2019s challenge. But Barca responded through an unlikely hero in left-back Gerard Martin, who first crossed for Eric Garcia to cut the difference in the 54th minute and produced an even better delivery for a Olmo header six minutes later.\nBut Inter succeeded in ending Barca\u2019s treble quest \u2014 and will go to Munich for their second Champions League final in three years. With 13 goals over the two legs, it became the joint-highest-scoring tie in the competition.\nHere, James Horncastle, Stuart James and Thom Harris break down another crazy semi-final game between the teams.\nHow did Inter pull this off?\nSimone Inzaghi\u2019s side thought they were out. They had conceded three goals without reply, another 2-0 lead wiped out, as at Montjuic a week ago. The oldest squad left in the competition, they looked dead and buried. They needed a Hail Mary.\nIt came in the form of a long ball. It did not look like it was going to work. When Marcus Thuram won the second ball, he misplaced his pass. But the unstoppable Denzel Dumfries refused to give it up as a long cause.\nBarcelona\u2019s nemesis in this tie was not done. On the contrary, he was on hand to undo them again.\nInter captain Martinez was not in the area to finish Dumfries\u2019 cross. Inzaghi had taken off the striker. Instead, Inter\u2019s centre-back Francesco Acerbi turned centre-forward and pressed restart when the game-over credits were rolling.\nHis goal made it 3-3 and gave every neutral exactly what they wanted \u2014 another half hour of this glorious game of football. Inter could have been forgiven for thinking throughout the second half that Barca could not be killed.\nSubstitutes Mehdi Taremi and Frattesi combined for a logic-defying winner. Goalkeeper Yann Sommer did the rest, getting his hands to shots from Lamine Yamal to keep Barca out. Who knows? The same hands may lift the trophy in Munich.\nJames Horncastle\nWhere does this rank among the great Champions League ties?\nJust what is it about this competition that consistently produces such madness?\nThis was the Champions League at its mind-bending best, momentum swinging one way before bulldozing through everything we thought we knew on its way back.\nAdvertisement\nInter looked deflated as a testing second half wore on, with Raphinha\u2019s late sucker-punch the third goal they conceded without reply after the break. Barely 15 minutes later \u2014 after their 37-year-old centre-back scored the stoppage-time equaliser \u2014 and they were ahead, taking the lead for the fourth time in 210 senseless minutes.\nOn goals alone, this tie is among the greats. Only two knockout ties can match the 13 goals Barcelona and Inter mustered up \u2014 Liverpool\u2019s 7-6 semi-final win against Roma in 2018, and Bayern Munich\u2019s 12-1 hammering of Sporting CP in the round of 16 a decade before that. But for tension, drama, frenzy and fight, neither came close.\nWe have seen impossible comebacks over the years \u2014 Liverpool\u2019s 4-0 win at Anfield to overturn a three-goal deficit against Barcelona, and Barcelona\u2019s own \u2018remontada\u2019 to overturn a four-goal loss in Paris. The 2005 final involved Liverpool heroics, too, the 1999 final saw Manchester United come from behind against Bayern Munich, and what about Lucas Moura\u2019s prodded finish to seal a 3-2 win for Tottenham Hotspur against Ajax?\nAll of this, without even mentioning the undisputed kings of Champions League comebacks, Real Madrid.\nPick your favourite. Tonight\u2019s epic is right up there with the best.\nThom Harris\nDumfries\u2019 two goals and three assists against Barca\nThe composure and presence of mind to slide the ball across the penalty area into a centre-forward. An instinctive run into the penalty area from a defence-splitting pass. Five goal contributions across two Champions League semi-final games.\nWing-backs do not normally do this, but watching Dumfries in the context of this tie \u2014 a gloriously flawed contest on a thumping, adrenaline-filled night \u2014 his effectiveness down the right side began to make sense.\nDumfries is difficult to stop, not only pacy and powerful, but also selective and effective in his forward bursts. His contribution in the dramatic 3-3 draw was more about timing, tiptoeing to stay onside while offering for the diagonal ball behind Barcelona\u2019s high line. Tonight\u2019s pulsating win saw the 29-year-old Netherlands international bide his time and dig in defensively, before finding his moments to race forward in attack.\nAdvertisement\nHis assist for Martinez shows just how much attacking freedom Dumfries is given down his flank, already looking to break the last defensive line with a run just seconds after Federico Dimarco turns over the ball. What follows is unselfish \u2014 but Dumfries has touched the ball 135 times in the box in league and European football this season. It is hardly unfamiliar ground.\nSuch positivity can come at a cost \u2014 Dumfries was caught wandering up the pitch as Raphinha scored what looked to be a dramatic late winner \u2014 but it was his ambition again behind Acerbi\u2019s unlikely equaliser. On chaotic nights like these, sheer forward momentum and unchecked forward thinking bring so much more than it can possibly take away.\nInter hit you hard on the counter \u2014 two bustling strikers who can take the ball down, shuttling runs from midfielders, central defenders who get forward well. But few pack a punch quite like Dumfries. His destructive power in a game of second-choice full-backs and high defensive lines is consistently hard to track.\nThom Harris\nWas it a penalty on Martinez?\nDare we say it, this was one of those occasions when you could not help but recognise the value of the VAR system.\nOn first viewing, Barcelona\u2019s 18-year-old defender Cubarsi looked to have made a brilliantly timed sliding challenge on Martinez, the sort of tackle that you applaud \u2014 it genuinely looked that good. That was certainly how Szymon Marciniak, the Polish referee, saw things, too. Play carried on with Barcelona on the attack at the other end as Martinez lay in a heap in the Barcelona penalty area.\nBut on second viewing, with the help of slow-motion replays, everything appeared rather different. Stretching every sinew to make the challenge, Cubarsi actually kicked through Martinez\u2019s right boot \u2014 the foot the Inter striker had planted as he prepared to shoot with his left \u2014 to get to the ball.\nSent to the monitor by the side of the pitch to review the incident, Marciniak took little time to realise that it was a penalty. The Barcelona players were furious \u2014 Marciniak stopped to explain to the central defender, Inigo Martinez, what he had seen, gesturing with his hand to show that Cubarsi had made contact with Martinez first.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting how we talk about VAR because at first glance, it looks like a good challenge,\u201d Mark Clattenburg, the former FIFA and Premier League official, told the UK broadcaster Amazon Prime in his punditry role. \u201cBut this is where VAR has changed football so much and this is where it creates so much debate.\u201d\nIn truth, there was not much debate after watching the footage back.\nStuart James\nHow did Inter cope with Yamal?\nInter were better from the experience of facing Yamal at Montjuic. Alessandro Bastoni said all the video analysis they did before the first leg counted for little when encountering the real thing. A week later, Inter had more of a feel for the 17-year-old winger.\nBut that did not stop Yamal from looking like he could do whatever he wanted. Within seconds of kick-off, he played an outside-of-the-foot through ball that briefly had San Siro scared. He kept skipping past Dimarco and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, in particular, with ease.\nLuckily for Inter in the first half, Yamal either stopped himself or his team-mates let him down.\nDani Olmo wasted a wonderful ball in behind, and when Yamal himself entered the box his decision-making was off. He passed instead of taking a shot. A crunching tackle in the box from the excellent Bastoni also let Yamal know he was up against one of the best centre-backs in the world, who seemed to relish the challenge.\nYamal, it must be said, then started the transition on the edge of his own penalty area that almost culminated in Garcia scoring a second of the night before Olmo\u2019s equaliser. He then flew past the newly introduced Carlos Augusto and drew a foul from Bastoni.\nPretty little things that added up to another good performance. Mkhitaryan and San Siro were praying for a VAR check to overrule a penalty won by Yamal \u2014 with debate over whether the foul continued into the area. It was marginal and the relief was palpable when it was chalked off. Inter could breathe for a second or two, but Yamal had left his opponents breathless again.\nJames Horncastle\nBarca\u2019s unlikely full-back heroes are not enough\nIt was a night for unsung heroes for Barcelona \u2014 unsung full-backs, even.\nIdeally, Jules Kounde would have been starting for Barcelona at right-back and Alejandro Balde at left-back. Both were ruled out through injury.\nAdvertisement\nStep up, Garcia and Martin. Trailing 2-0 against Inter, Barcelona\u2019s two full-backs combined to halve the deficit before Martin delivered a wonderful cross to set up the equaliser for Olmo. Both were superb goals and perfectly timed for a Barcelona side that desperately needed to find a way back into the game.\nMartin may have been trying to pick out Olmo with his centre for the first goal. Whether that was the case or not, Garcia arrived just behind his Barca team-mate and emphatically dispatched a side-footed volley, expertly opening his body to steer the ball beyond Sommer and high into the roof of the net. It was a controlled volley and a superb piece of technique.\nFor UK viewers:\nDANI OLMO PUTS BARCA LEVEL \ud83d\udd25\nA free header at the far post means the tie is now tied at 5-5 \ud83d\ude31#UCLonPrime pic.twitter.com/7zpV1fBH1b\n\u2014 Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) May 6, 2025\nFor U.S. viewers:\nDANI OLMO MAKES IT 5-5 ON AGGREGATE \ud83e\udd75 pic.twitter.com/YuyIJvhVb6\n\u2014 CBS Sports Golazo \u26bd\ufe0f (@CBSSportsGolazo) May 6, 2025\nIn stark contrast to his performance in the first leg, when he was withdrawn after 45 minutes, Martin played with confidence and purpose at San Siro, especially in the second half, when he provided an impressive outlet for Barca on the left flank.\nUnfortunately for Martin, he was caught out at the other end of the pitch in stoppage time when Dumfries dispossessed him (Barca felt that it was a foul, but the left-back looked a little passive) before crossing for Acerbi to sweep home a 93-minute equaliser.\nStuart James\nWhat did Inter\u2019s players and Simone Inzaghi say?\n\u201cMy heart was beating out of my chest, it\u2019s really incredible,\u201d match-winner Frattesi told CBS after the game. \u201cThere will never be another match like that. It\u2019s crazy. My family are all here today and this is something I will tell my kids in the future.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhen we conceded the third goal, I spoke to Marcus Thuram and I said we would go to the final. I don\u2019t know how we then scored the goal. It was crazy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know (how I scored). Maybe it\u2019s because I thought if I don\u2019t score I\u2019m f***ed!\u201d\n\u201cWe had some problems but, with heart, we went over every obstacle,\u201d Inzaghi said, as reported by Uefa.com. \u201cWe tried to play with the qualities we have. After the first leg, we had the game plan in mind, but without the sacrifice and the help of all of us together, you can\u2019t do it. Well done guys \u2014 they deserve this final.\u201d\nWhat did Hansi Flick say?\n\u201cThe players and the team deserve respect,\u201d Flick told his post-match press conference. \u201cWe want to win titles. The league. We play it on Sunday (in a crucial La Liga Clasico against Real Madrid) and we have three days to train and prepare for the match. When they come back and they look at themselves in the mirror, I hope they (the players) feel proud.\n\u201cThe cycle has started but we haven\u2019t reached the top. We have to stand up, that was the message I wanted to give (my players).\u201d\nWhat next for Inter?\nSunday, May 11: Torino (away), Serie A, 5pm UK, 12pm ET\nWhat next for Barcelona?\nSunday, May 11: Real Madrid (home), La Liga, 3.15pm UK, 10.15am ET\n(Top photo: Marco Bertorello/AFP via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim suffered the most embarrassing result of his Old Trafford reign as his woeful team were humiliated by League Two\u2019s Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.\nFirst-half goals from Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren, after errors from Andre Onana, saw the home side take a 2-0 lead before goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire sent the tie to penalties.\nAdvertisement\nMatheus Cunha had a chance to win the tie in the shootout, but his tame spot kick was kept out by Christy Pym and an epic 13-round shootout was only settled when Mbeumo\u2019s second penalty hit the bar. It was not a set of penalties that reflected well on Amorim\u2019s new \u00a3200m frontline, with Cunha and Mbeumo missing and Benjamin Sesko strangely 10th in the order.\nBut make no mistake, United got what they deserved, and this cranks up the pressure on Amorim, who oddly refused to watch his own side\u2019s penalties while sitting in the dugout.\nThis is only the third time in 30 years that United have gone out at the second-round stage. They were eliminated in 1995-96 by third-tier York City and then again by third-tier MK Dons in 2014-15. The defeat means Amorim\u2019s side can only play a maximum of 45 matches this season (and that would mean reaching the FA Cup final). Only once since 1959 have they played fewer games in a campaign (44 in 2014-15).\nUnited were second best in the opening stages and were made to pay in the 22nd minute when Vernam hammered a shot inside the near post \u2013 one on which Onana really should have done better. Amorim was serenaded by the obligatory \u2018sacked in the morning\u2019 chants, which got louder on the half hour when former United youngster Warren bundled in a second.\nThe United head coach\u2019s half-time response was to introduce captain Bruno Fernandes, Matthijs de Ligt and Mbeumo but, as the weather worsened, the home side were rarely tested and were only denied a third by a debatable offside call.\nMbeumo got United back into the tie with 15 minutes remaining. United piled forward in search of an equaliser and were rewarded in the 89th minute when Harry Maguire headed in Mason Mount\u2019s corner. Sesko almost stole it in the closing seconds before penalties served United their fate.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Carl Anka and Laurie Whitwell analyse the action.\nWhat was Andre Onana doing?\nGrimsby were meant to be a more compliant opponent for United than Arsenal and Fulham. The League Two side have started the season well \u2014 three wins and two draws \u2014 but travelling fans hoped and expected Amorim\u2019s men to run up a score.\nAdvertisement\nAmorim made eight changes from the team that started at Craven Cottage, affording several players their first minutes of the new season. But the rotated starting XI were second best for the majority of the first half at Blundell Park. Several players were guilty of overplaying the ball or falling foul of Grimsby\u2019s aggressive defending, prompting the head coach to turn his head away in frustration.\nGrimsby manager David Artell had told broadcast media he wanted his players to use the fixture as \u201ca platform for their career.\u201d The 22nd minute saw their early pressure come good. Right winger Darragh Burns fed Vernam on the far side of the box, and the striker took a touch before shooting beyond Onana at the near post. It was another shot-stopping mistake for Onana, who hadn\u2019t featured in United\u2019s opening two fixtures of the season.\nThe error was compounded eight minutes later, when Grimsby surprised United with a short-corner routine before floating the ball in towards the back post. Onana missed with his attempt to punch the ball and Warren bundled the ball in. Onana simply wasn\u2019t strong enough.\nAndr\u00e9 Onana with an ABSOLUTE SHOCKER as Grimsby double their lead! \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/ZPzqJVSpoa\n\u2014 CBS Sports Golazo \u26bd\ufe0f (@CBSSportsGolazo) August 27, 2025\nThis League Cup tie was meant to be a straightforward occasion. But two critical goalkeeping errors complicated things.\nCarl Anka\nWhat must agitated Amorim be thinking?\nThis was a humbling, deeply concerning occasion for Amorim. He had begun the match barking instructions to his players over their positions at kick-off, and he only grew more agitated as his team were overrun by a side three divisions below.\nAs the rain fell in the second half, he stood getting soaked, inevitably wondering how his United tenure has plunged so low. His team offered turgid football, and whatever the talk about individual errors, there are deep questions about the system he is so wedded to.\nAdvertisement\nStarting five defenders at a League Two side feels off for a United team, and the amount of guidance from the dugout shows there remains a disconnect between his players and an understanding of what Amorim wants.\nHe couldn\u2019t bring himself to celebrate when United equalised in the 89th minute and, indeed, all it offered was false hope. He was unable to watch the penalties, and there is an awkward symbolism about United\u2019s two signings from the Premier League this summer missing the crucial penalties.\nLaurie Whitwell\nDid Mainoo do enough?\nKobbie Mainoo\u2019s transfer situation made him the main topic of conversation before this tie. The Athletic understands the England international is open to a move away from Old Trafford this summer, while the club have been considering the prospect of selling him.\nPlaying time is the best cure for transfer tension, but Mainoo\u2019s performance provided limited answers to a wearying list of questions. Before the game, Amorim was asked what he expected of his 20-year-old midfielder.\n\u201cThe same as every player in that position. I expect a lot from Kobbie Mainoo and again people think that sometimes you need to just give. It\u2019s important for Kobbie to fight for his place. I believe a lot in Kobbie \u2014 more than everybody thinks \u2014 so I expect a lot from him.\u201d\nAs has been the case throughout United\u2019s pre-season tour, Mainoo started alongside Manuel Ugarte in central midfield. He attempted to go about his duties with his typical competency, but was undone by a Grimsby collective that denied any United player the chance to get comfortable.\nAt his best, Mainoo works as a press-resistant ball carrier; a lock-pick of a player who can manoeuvre the ball through tight spaces. He can be a wonderful cog in a well-structured team, but Amorim\u2019s 3-4-3 prefers its central midfielders to defend large areas of space, and to hit long balls into channels for the wing-backs/No 10s to collect and initiate quick attacks.\nAdvertisement\nMainoo managed 47 touches of the ball in the first half, but very few were conducive to United arresting a worrying slide. On more than one occasion, he would peel out of the right flank to offer an easy pass for Tyler Fredricson and Onana in early build-up.\nThere were some signs of rustiness; one pass to Patrick Dorgu in the 18th minute went woefully out of play and led to Amorim slapping his hands together before turning away from the action.\nAmorim\u2019s second-half changes brought some improvement from Mainoo. United\u2019s need for a comeback goal meant he was circumvented for sections of the second half as they attempted to play long, but there were still touches of quality.\nIt was his pass that found Mbeumo before the forward\u2019s dribble and shooting effort to make the score 2-1, and it fell to both Mainoo and Fernandes to find the many United bodies surging forward as the team went looking for an equaliser.\nCarl Anka\nWere United fortunate to even make it to the shootout?\nMaguire\u2019s 89th-minute header got United a precious equaliser to send the game to a penalty shootout, but the centre-back nearly played a part in giving Grimsby a 3-0 lead 15 minutes earlier.\nIt was in the 74th minute when a pass ricocheted off Maguire\u2019s left and into the path of Gardner. The linesman\u2019s flag was up early, before the striker\u2019s finish rested in the bottom corner.\nGardner was indeed in an offside position when the pass was made, but Maguire\u2019s touch could, or perhaps should, have reset the phase of play, meaning the assistant referee\u2019s call was incorrect. There was no VAR in this tie.\nCarl Anka\nWhat did Amorim say\nAmorim told Sky Sports after the match:\nWhy was it so hard?\nIn the end it doesn\u2019t matter if we recover or not. It is the signs we gave during the game. The beginning of the game\u2026I know the best team won. The only team on the pitch. The best players lose. One team can win against any group of players. I think the team and the players spoke really loud today. We lost, the best team won.\nAdvertisement\nWhat do you mean?\n\u201cIt\u2019s really clear what they spoke. So lets move on from this day and it was really clear for everyone what happened today. I don\u2019t know (why they had space). Its not just that but the way we start the game without any intensity, the idea of the pressure. We were completely lost, it is hard to explain.\nWas it the same as last season?\n\u201cYes, that is a problem. When you lose but you see something new, its different. When you see something like today, its hard to talk about that. I am really sorry for the fans. With the support they always have. I have nothing to say, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a game on the weekend and then we have two weeks. And we will solve things.\n\u201cWhen you play against a fourth division team, it is not the goalkeeper (Onana). It is everything, the environment, the way we faced the competition. People will pay attention to everything. Every detail. We showed that performance today. My players spoke for me really loud.\u201d\nWhat next for United?\nSaturday, August 30: Burnley (home), Premier League, 3pm UK, 10am ET\n(Top photo: Amorim had no answer to what Grimsby threw at him and United; Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Champions\nLeague Draw\nlive\nUpdated 4m ago\nChampions League draw live updates: Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and more to learn European fate today\nChampions League draw \u2014 latest\nThe draw for the 36-team league phase of the 2025-26 Champions League will take place in Monaco later today.\nFor the first time in the history of the tournament there will be no fewer than six Premier League sides involved: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham.\n- Start time: 5pm BST, 12pm EDT\n- Watch: TNT (UK), Paramount+ (US)\n- Email: live@theathletic.com\nAssessing the contenders \u2014 PSG\nThe reigning champions are undoubtedly favourites to retain their crown, with manager Luis Enrique and last season\u2019s squad still in place, plus they\u2019ve added defender Illia Zabarnyi and goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier. They were exposed by Chelsea\u2019s direct tactics at the Club World Cup and squeaked past several English teams in 2024-25, so they\u2019re not infallible. Plus how hungry are they for more?\nAdvertisement\nWas the league phase a success last year?\nThere were some thrills during the league phase last season. Unexpectedly, holders Real Madrid, along with Manchester City, Bayern Munich, PSG and Juventus all finished in the play-off spots.\nIt did create more interesting and competitive ties. Many argued a negative of the traditional group-stage phase was that there were too many dead-rubber games. But there were plenty of surprise results in the league phase \u2014 Sporting\u2019s 4-1 thumping of Manchester City, Aston Villa beating Bayern Munich at home and Dortmund thrashing Barcelona 3-1, to name just three.\nThe final gameday of the league phase, which saw 18 matches take place at the same time, also created drama as the league table changed multiple times and there was uncertainty around the participation of the aforementioned big-name clubs.\nThe surprise league-phase results also made for interesting knockout ties. Liverpool finished top of the league but were drawn against eventual winners PSG in a blockbuster last-16 tie.\nBarcelona\u2019s special request\nBarcelona are expected to be given permission to play their first 2025-26 Champions League league phase fixture away from home, but the Catalan club must tell UEFA by September 21 where they plan to play their home games in the competition.\nUEFA, European football\u2019s governing body, do not usually allow any movement within their fixture list but it could be allowed given the exceptional circumstances of Barcelona\u2019s continuing issues returning to play at their Camp Nou home.\nBarca have not played at the stadium since starting a \u20ac1.5billion (\u00a31.3bn; $1.8bn) refurbishment project in June 2023, hosting games at the Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys across the city while works progress.\nGO FURTHER\nBarcelona request to play first Champions League game away amid Camp Nou delay\nGet involved today\nA reminder that we\u2019d love to hear from you today and you can get involved by emailing live@theathletic.com.\nYour views on the \u2018new\u2019 UCL format\n\u270d\ufe0f Kwaku O: \u201cThere\u2019s really no advantage in being in pot 1 anymore. You still play the best teams so it\u2019s a weird design. I guess you get better games early, but you still have a gamble of losing some top teams early.\u201d\n\u270d\ufe0f JP: \u201cI really enjoyed the new format last season. There were more interesting matches early on and not as many dead rubbers. The downside is PSG and Real Madrid were poor early on but still reached the knockouts. So it seemed there was less danger.\u201d\n\u270d\ufe0f Igo H: \u201cThe format was okay but there are just too many matches. And with AFCON in the middle of the season and the World Cup at the end of it I\u2019m guessing the quality is going to dip badly at some stage.\u201d\nThe Champions League dates to know\nLeague phase\n- Matchday 1: 16\u201318 September 2025\n- Matchday 2: 30 September\u20131 October 2025\n- Matchday 3: 21/22 October 2025\n- Matchday 4: 4/5 November 2025\n- Matchday 5: 25/26 November 2025\n- Matchday 6: 9/10 December 2025\n- Matchday 7: 20/21 January 2026\n- Matchday 8: 28 January 2026\nKnockout phase\n- Knockout phase play-offs: 17/18 & 24/25 February 2026\n- Round of 16: 10/11 & 17/18 March 2026\n- Quarter-finals: 7/8 & 14/15 April 2026\n- Semi-finals: 28/29 April & 5/6 May 2026\n- Final: 30 May 2026 (Budapest)\nAdvertisement\nWhen will the fixtures be announced?\nThe tournament\u2019s fixture list, including match dates and kick-off times, will be published no later than Saturday, 30 August, allowing time for the draws of UEFA\u2019s other club competitions.\nThe league phase matchdays start on September 16-18, 2025 and conclude on matchday eight on January 28, 2026.\nWhich teams are in which pot?\nTeams are paired against two teams from each of the four pots, one home and one away. However, teams from the same association cannot be drawn against each other, and teams cannot face more than two opponents from the same association.\nPot 1\n- Paris Saint-Germain (FRA)\n- Real Madrid (ESP)\n- Manchester City (ENG)\n- Bayern M\u00fcnchen (GER)\n- Liverpool (ENG)\n- Inter (ITA)\n- Chelsea (ENG)\n- Borussia Dortmund (GER)\n- Barcelona (ESP)\nPot 2\n- Arsenal (ENG)\n- Leverkusen (GER)\n- Atletico Madrid (ESP)\n- Benfica (POR)\n- Atalanta (ITA)\n- Villarreal (ESP)\n- Juventus (ITA)\n- Frankfurt (GER)\n- Club Brugge (BEL)\nPot 3\n- Tottenham Hotspur (ENG)\n- PSV Eindhoven (NED)\n- Ajax (NED)\n- Napoli (ITA)\n- Sporting CP (POR)\n- Olympiacos (GRE)\n- Slavia Praha (CZE)\n- Bod\u00f8/Glimt (NOR)\n- Marseille (FRA)\nPot 4\n- Copenhagen (DEN)\n- Monaco (FRA)\n- Galatasaray (TUR)\n- Union SG (BEL)\n- Qaraba\u011f (AZE)\n- Athletic Club (ESP)\n- Newcastle (ENG)\n- Pafos (CYP)\n- Kairat Almaty (KAZ)\nThe seven remaining teams will be the play-off winners from Wednesday\u2019s ties.\nAll 36 teams ranked and reviewed\nIt is just 90 days since Paris Saint-Germain claimed their first Champions League with a 5-0 thrashing of Inter\u2026 and now the draw for the 2025-26 edition is upon us.\nPlenty has changed in the interim. Managers have come and gone, hundreds of millions have been spent (and that\u2019s just at Liverpool) and Chelsea have somehow become world champions despite not even being part of Europe\u2019s elite competition last season.\nSo, with the Champions League line-up for this year\u2019s tournament now complete ahead of today\u2019s draw in Nyon, how do we assess each of them? This is our definitive \u2014 but also entirely subjective, and extremely debatable \u2014 ranking.\nGO FURTHER\nThe Champions League: All 36 teams ranked and reviewed\nWho runs the draw?\nLike last year, the software used to run the automated draw has been provided by AE Live, while global financial services company Ernst and Young will return to Monte Carlo to provide the review and control of the process.\nNo all-English ties just yet\nTo save time, the process is now almost totally automated, with human involvement now limited to the on-stage drawing of the 36 involved teams. After each side emerges from the \u2018hat\u2019, a button is pressed that immediately reveals that club\u2019s eight opponents for the league phase.\nEach team will square off against two opponents from each of the four pots, including two from their own pot, across eight total matches \u2013 split evenly between home and away.\nNo team from the same country can be drawn against each other, nor can a side play more than two matches against sides from the same nation. For example, Liverpool cannot face Arsenal \u2013 or all of Spanish trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid \u2013 in the league phase.\nThese caveats, plus the seeding system, means teams already have a shortlist of opponents they\u2019ll face in the tournament even before the draw has begun.\nAdvertisement\nHow today\u2019s draw will work\nThe good news is that the format for the draw is exactly the same as last year. The caveat is that you may still need some reminding of just how UEFA\u2019s new, digital-heavy drawing process works.\nLast season saw the eight-groups-of-four arrangement of former tournament\u2019s abandoned for a new \u2018Swiss Model\u2019 league format, and with it went the all-manual draws of old.\nNow, four pots of nine are seeded by coefficient, a score based on the performances of teams competing across the five previous seasons of the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.\nThe reigning Champions League winners are the only club not seeded by coefficient, meaning Paris Saint-Germain will be first side drawn on Thursday.\nGet involved\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you today. Who do you think is going to win this season\u2019s Champions League? Are you a fan of the new format? And is six English teams too many?!\nEmail us at live@theathletic.com.\nHow can I watch today\u2019s draw?\nFree live coverage of the draw will be available on UEFA.com, while UK viewers can watch or stream the action on TNT Sports 1 and Discovery+ respectively.\nViewers in the US can watch on Paramount+.\nAnd stick with us throughout as our team of reporters from around Europe bring you the latest news and reaction.\nWhat time is today\u2019s draw?\nThe draw will commence at 6pm local time in Monaco.\nThat\u2019s 5pm BST, 12pm EDT and 9am PDT.\nWelcome to our live coverage today\nHello and welcome to our live coverage of the league phase draw of the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League.\nThere will be a record six Premier League clubs competing in Europe\u2019s top tournament this season \u2014 but Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham will be kept apart in today\u2019s draw.\nThis will be the second instalment of UEFA\u2019s new Champions League format, which consists of one 36-team league phase.\nMore on that later."

      "text": "AC Milan and Chelsea have reached an agreement over a permanent transfer for forward Christopher Nkunku.\nA package of \u20ac42million (\u00a336.2m) plus a sell-on clause has been agreed with the France international, with permission to travel and personal terms already in place.\nThe Athletic reported on Wednesday that the Serie A side were exploring a move and there had been club-to-club contact for Nkunku. The forward had also attracted interest from Bayern Munich and his former club RB Leipzig.\nAdvertisement\nNkunku, 27, was left out of head coach Enzo Maresca\u2019s first two Premier League matchday squads amid the expectation of him leaving this summer.\nMilan have explored moves for multiple forwards this transfer window, having Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Victor Boniface in for a medical and evaluating a move for Sporting CP\u2019s Conrad Harder. Neither transfer materialised.\nNkunku has made 62 appearances for Chelsea since joining in the summer of 2023, registering 18 goals and five assists. Last season he made 43 appearances in all competitions, scoring 14 goals, and played in six of the London side\u2019s seven Club World Cup games.\nMilan finished eighth in Serie A last season and have lost their first league game of the 2025-26 campaign.\nTheir next league game is against Lecce on Friday.\n(Phot0: Michael Steele/Getty Images)"

      "text": "August is not yet over, the season is only three games old, and Ruben Amorim is already dropping big hints that talks over his future as Manchester United head coach will come during the international break that begins next week.\nThat is the clear interpretation of his words after United were knocked out of a cup competition by a fourth-tier team for the first time in their history on Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nAmorim had the ignominy of walking back out onto the Blundell Park pitch, where his players had laboured to a penalty-shootout defeat having come from two goals down to draw 2-2, to be greeted by hundreds of jubilant Grimsby Town fans singing at him, \u201cSacked in the morning\u201d.\nHe then proceeded to give the impression that he might well take the matter out of the hierarchy\u2019s hands, telling UK broadcaster ITV: \u201cI think the players spoke really loudly about what they want today. Something has to change, and you\u2019re not going to change 22 players again. It\u2019s hard to face everything. We move to the next game, then we have time to decide things.\u201d\nPromoted Burnley are United\u2019s opponents at Old Trafford on Saturday, then there\u2019s a two-week international window after that match until the derby trip to Manchester City on Sunday, September 14.\nChief executive Omar Berrada was recruited from City to try to replicate the success across Manchester, with fellow City old boy Jason Wilcox following after his short spell at Southampton and being promoted to director of football. They are finding the red half of town is a different world entirely.\nBerrada was not at Blundell Park, with Wilcox the only member of United\u2019s football leadership team present in the directors\u2019 box, but all those in charge at the club will no doubt be across Amorim\u2019s latest detonation. Their reputations are linked to his now, and figuring out how to proceed will be top of the agenda in the coming days.\nUltimately though, Sir Jim Ratcliffe will make the call. United\u2019s co-owner has entrusted those running the club for him to do so, but he holds strong opinions\u2026 and usually shares them.\nRatcliffe has already said how he likes Amorim\u2019s blunt turn of phrase. And the head coach\u2019s round of post-game media interviews in Grimsby certainly displayed his forthright mindset. He gave stark appraisals to Sky Sports, Radio 5 Live, and even in-house channel MUTV, adding to his comments to the written press: \u201cI would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I\u2019m really sorry for our fans. It\u2019s too much sometimes.\u201d\nOnly four weeks ago in Chicago, during United\u2019s U.S. pre-season tour, Amorim confirmed he had considered his position at times last season following his November appointment, as The Athletic had previously reported. But he was resolute on having become certain of his course at the club. Reports emerged of the camp being unprecedentedly positive and unified. It seems this was a fragile rebirth, though.\nAdvertisement\nAmorim also said last night: \u201cThe way we start the game without any intensity, all the idea of the pressure, we were completely lost, and that\u2019s why I think they (the players) spoke really loud (with their actions).\u201d\nUnited did eventually spasm into a comeback in the final 15 minutes to force the shootout but it was false hope, and in any case, Amorim said, the performance before those spot kicks was the \u201csign\u201d that \u201cmattered\u201d. He said: \u201cIf we win this game, it was so unfair for the opponent.\u201d\nNot only did United lose to a League Two club, they were overrun by one which had been rotated by head coach David Artell. Grimsby were not at full strength.\nThe whole occasion cut an awkward contrast against Berrada\u2019s decree to staff on the eve of this season to work for the United badge with bravery and spirit.\nUnited\u2019s descent to disarray was all the more pronounced because of the setting, with Blundell Park being so far removed from customary. Two United team buses had to painstakingly reverse into position by the players\u2019 entrance, squeezing around tight corners and through a growing throng of people. Kids on parents\u2019 shoulders offered a few choice words to the stars disembarking the coaches, who combined cost more than \u00a3700million.\nGrimsby chief executive Polly Bancroft, formerly head of women\u2019s football at United, had joked there would not be enough seats in the away dugout, which one substitute, Matthijs de Ligt, made light of by initially sitting on the floor.\nAmorim\u2019s agitation was evident at kick-off, as he barked orders before the referee had even blown his whistle for Amad to shift position. Later, Carlos Fernandes, Amorim\u2019s assistant who leads set pieces and stands up whenever there is one happening on the pitch, shouted for Matheus Cunha to move to a more central position in the United box at a corner. Grimsby scored their second goal moments later.\nAdvertisement\nGoalkeeper Andre Onana got the inadvertent assist for that, flapping at a high ball, and he aided the opener too, by letting Charles Vernam\u2019s shot slip through his arms. United are in talks for Royal Antwerp\u2019s goalkeeper Senne Lammens but neither a fee nor personal terms are agreed.\nAmorim said the loss was not down to Onana, though: \u201cThis is a fourth-division team, Andre should play just with his feet during this game.\u201d But as the skies opened in the second half, and Amorim stood on the touchline getting soaked, he must have wondered quite how Onana had turned in a display so bad.\nAmorim prowling his technical area amid torrential rain will be one of the enduring images from this tie, so too his tweaks on the miniature tactics board in his lap as the minutes ticked away. He later rejected the idea that his system is to blame.\nPlayers have to take accountability, of course. This was not a great night for those who have been signed by Ratcliffe\u2019s regime. Patrick Dorgu hit the roof of the stand behind the goal with a cross and was hooked at half-time. Manuel Ugarte, weak for the Grimsby opener, was also replaced at the break. Joshua Zirkzee only got on with eight minutes left as his injury recovery continues at a delicate pace.\nLeny Yoro did well in being free from this blemish, as he was left at home. Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, United\u2019s two Premier League signings this summer, missed their shootout penalties, although the latter had got his team back into the game with a neat finish.\nBenjamin Sesko made little impact and was, curiously, United\u2019s last outfield penalty taker \u2014 converting after Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Kobbie Mainoo and De Ligt. Mainoo played the full contest, another intriguing subplot in light of his displeasure at falling down the pecking order.\nAs the shootout ran on and on to 12-11, Amorim sat back in the dugout, his eyes closed on occasion, unable to watch.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Mbeumo smacked the bar on his second go-around to finally end the tie, the home crowd burst onto the pitch. Kids were on shoulders again, in an echo of United\u2019s arrival in town hours earlier. Fernandes, alongside United\u2019s new team manager Acacio Valentim, shielded Mbeumo from those looking to goad.\nUnited are a punchline again. But, in light of Amorim\u2019s apparent state of mind, how will they attempt to reclaim seriousness? Stick on current plans in the final days of the summer transfer window, or does this provoke a rethink about a possible twist in the final days? And is this the earliest crisis-mode ever activated in a United campaign?\n(Top photo: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Manchester United have completed the signing of forward Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.\nMbeumo, 25, has signed a five-year deal to June 2030 at Old Trafford, with the option of a further 12 months.\nThe Athletic reported on Friday that after weeks of negotiations a deal worth up to \u00a371million ($95.5m) had been struck, comprising of an initial \u00a365m, to be paid in four instalments, plus a maximum of \u00a36m in bonuses.\nAdvertisement\nBrentford had been looking to secure a fee that surpassed the \u00a362.5m United paid Wolverhampton Wanderers to sign Matheus Cunha earlier this window. United\u2019s initial proposal of \u00a345m plus \u00a310m in add-ons was rejected, while a second offer of \u00a355m plus \u00a37.5m in bonuses was also turned down.\nTottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Newcastle United had previously held an interest in Mbeumo, though he wanted to join United, as first reported by The Athletic on June 2, revealing he had supported them while growing up.\n\u201cAs soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up,\u201d Mbeumo said.\n\u201cMy mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from (head coach) Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players\n\u201cEverybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\u201d\nJason Wilcox, United\u2019s director of football, said: \u201cBryan\u2019s goals and assists record in the Premier League is exceptional, his remarkable consistency has put him amongst the most productive players in England for the last three seasons.\n\u201cBryan\u2019s belief in our project and determination to join the club confirmed that he was the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing.\n\u201cWe are delighted to have secured another one of our primary targets ahead of the pre-season tour. The experience in the US will be the perfect opportunity for Bryan to work with Ruben and his new team-mates as we prepare for an exciting season ahead.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe Cameroon international is United\u2019s third attacking signing of the summer after Cunha\u2019s transfer from Wolves and Enzo Kana-Biyik\u2019s arrival, though the 18-year-old will spend next season on loan at Swiss Super League side Lausanne-Sport.\nMarcus Rashford, meanwhile, travelled to Barcelona on Sunday after an agreement was reached for the forward to move to the Spanish champions on a season-long loan.\nMbeumo made 242 appearances for Brentford after signing from French club Troyes in 2019, registering 70 goals and 51 assists in all competitions.\n\u2018A proven Premier League talent\u2019\nAnalysis by Jay Harris\nMbeumo has developed from a talented but frustrating winger into a consistent goal threat during his time at Brentford.\nHe has played in multiple positions across the front line, including as a support striker to Ivan Toney in a front two, but has produced his best performances on the right wing.\nMbeumo likes to cut inside onto his left foot to shoot or whip crosses into the box. When Thomas Frank was in charge of Brentford, he occasionally deployed Mbeumo as an aggressive right wing-back when they were losing games.\nDuring Brentford\u2019s first season in the Premier League, Mbeumo only scored four times from an xG of 9.5 and hit the woodwork seven times. He was guilty of being erratic and making the wrong decisions in front of goal.\nThrough hard work on the training ground, he has developed into an excellent finisher. During the 2023-24 season, Mbeumo scored seven goals and registered four assists in 15 games before he suffered ankle ligament damage which required surgery in a defeat to Brighton. The Cameroonian bounced back last season and scored 20 times in the league.\nMbeumo has an excellent penalty record too and has only missed one of the 12 he has taken for Brentford. He makes selfless runs for the team and works hard out of possession. His availability is another encouraging sign for United because he has only missed 16 games across four seasons in the top-flight with Brentford.\nAdvertisement\nUnited are signing a proven Premier League talent who has worked hard for and deserves an opportunity at a bigger club. Brentford will be sad to lose him, but they have been in this position multiple times before with the departures of Christian Eriksen, Ivan Toney and David Raya. They will take comfort in the fact that Mbeumo has doubled their previous club-record sale which was set when Toney moved to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli last year for \u00a333.6m.\n(Photo: David Rogers/Getty Images)"

      "text": "It was like watching an old movie as Viktor Gyokeres opened his Arsenal scoring account against Leeds United at the weekend.\nAt least that\u2019s how it felt for those of us who had looked at the 97 goals new-signing striker Gyokeres got for his previous club, Sporting CP. Let\u2019s call that pre-season research. There were a lot of penalties in those clips \u2014 27 of them to be exact \u2014 and, with that in mind, it was no surprise when Gyokeres converted from the spot late on in that 5-0 home win over promoted Leeds.\nAdvertisement\nBut within his Sporting collection, there was also what you might describe as a trademark Gyokeres run and goal.\nThe Sweden international loves sprinting into the channels, especially on the left, where his pace and power make it hard for defenders to stop him. The move below, from a game against Boavista last season, is a classic example.\nIt is a run that not only stretches opponents and, on other occasions, provides his team with an \u201cout-ball\u201d, it also opens up the opportunity for Gyokeres to go one-versus-one against the centre-back on that side, before shifting onto his right foot to shoot \u2014 often at the near post.\nCue the goal that Gyokeres scored early in the second half on Saturday.\nIt was also how he scored against Porto in 2023:\nAnd against Dumiense in the same season:\nAnd against Estoril in his final campaign with the Lisbon club, where Gyokeres ended up more centrally positioned after initially drifting in from the left flank, but once again reversed his shot inside the goalkeeper\u2019s near post.\nOccasionally, Gyokeres has moved in from the left and shot across the \u2019keeper, as in the example below against Rio Ave last season\u2026\n\u2026 and at the end of the Boavista clip at the start of this article, which showed his intense running into the left channel:\nEither way, his goals so often originate from pulling onto that flank, which is fertile ground for a player with Gyokeres\u2019 physical attributes and a natural desire to come inside onto his right foot. It also addresses a weakness in Arsenal\u2019s attacking play last season (more about that later).\nWhen my colleague Thom Harris wrote about Gyokeres in early July, prior to the 27-year-old completing the move to Arsenal, he highlighted his off-the-ball runs and the extent to which he sprints behind, or laterally, compared to coming short to receive a pass or link play.\nAccording to data from SkillCorner, Gyokeres made 85 sprints in behind the opposition defensive line last season \u2014 defined as runs at an average pace of 25km/h or more. To put that number into context, it was 24 more than the 2024-25 Premier League\u2019s leader in that metric, Nicolas Jackson of Chelsea.\nAdvertisement\nThe question for many was how any of this would work with Arsenal\u2019s style of play and also in the Premier League. There is unlikely to be the same sort of space in behind he saw with Sporting, given the way that opponents often set up with a deeper block against Mikel Arteta\u2019s team, plus higher-quality teams across the English top flight.\nClearly, that\u2019s not something that can be answered after a couple of matches, and it would be silly to try to do so. At the same time, there have been a couple of incidents that, perhaps, provide a hint of how Arsenal will try to look to utilise their new No 9 in the months to come.\nThat goal against Leeds is interesting to break down because of the build-up beforehand. There was also a moment the week before, in the 1-0 away win against Manchester United, that highlighted Gyokeres\u2019 value to Arsenal during transitional moments \u2014 even if that particular attack came to nothing.\nUnited turned the ball over in opposition territory, and that gave Arteta\u2019s team a chance to counter-attack in a way that would have looked very different with Kai Havertz or Gabriel Jesus leading the line.\nGyokeres was setting off before Martin Odegaard even shaped to pass, running hard into the left channel, on the inside of Leny Yoro and moving beyond the United defender. It was prime Gyokeres territory as he cut in near the penalty area, but, unfortunately, he ended up standing on the ball. That could happen to anyone. It was bad luck for Gyokeres that it happened to him in a game that some people seemed to want to frame as judgment day as to whether he was going to be a success or a failure in the Premier League.\nAgainst Leeds, Gyokeres\u2019 first goal for Arsenal came from controlled possession, rather than a transition, and it\u2019s interesting to analyse the way in which Arteta\u2019s players created that opportunity.\nAdvertisement\nWhen you watch the move back, at first glance, it appears as though Riccardo Calafiori played a blind pass over the top for Gyokeres. But rewind a bit further, and Califiori is looking at Gyokeres as Gabriel slides a ball into the feet of Noni Madueke.\nWhat follows is a classic third-man movement pattern that sucks Leeds in with the intention of playing a ball into the space that opens up behind them.\nAdmittedly, Leeds don\u2019t help themselves by playing such a high line with no pressure on the ball (Calafiori in particular). But something else happens to free up that channel for Gyokeres.\nWhen Gabriel has possession, Declan Rice initially looks to make a forward run into that area where his striker ends up:\nWhen Gabriel passes to Madueke instead of going longer, Rice looks across at Gyokeres and peels out towards the wing:\nThat movement drags Joe Rodon, Leeds\u2019 right-sided centre back, across to mark him, leaving Gyokeres one-versus-one against Pascal Struijk. At the same time, Gabriel\u2019s pass to Madueke has forced Jayden Bogle, the Leeds right-back, to move up to press him.\nThe result is that Calafiori, who has rolled infield from left-back to an inverted position, has a lovely area to clip a ball into for Gyokeres to chase. It\u2019s a relatively simple passage of play, but hugely effective.\nThat left channel is an area where Arsenal lacked a threat last season. Just 32.9 per cent of their attacking touches came in the left third, the lowest proportion of any Premier League team (for the record, 43 per cent of their attacking touches were on the right).\nAll of which points to Gyokeres bringing something a little bit different to the Arsenal forward line in more ways than one, even if it involves a very familiar move for him.\n\u201cThat will help us to evolve and find other ways of attacking teams and connecting with each other,\u201d Arteta said post-match on Saturday, when asked about Gyokeres\u2019 first goal in Arsenal colours. \u201cIt\u2019s clear where Viktor is really dangerous, what his superpower is.\n\u201cLet\u2019s put him as much as possible in those kinds of scenarios because something will happen.\u201d\n(Top photo: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)"

      "text": "On the indoor pitch of Manchester United\u2019s academy and women\u2019s building on Monday, chief executive Omar Berrada addressed club staff to mark the start of the new Premier League season.\nBerrada said that everyone was gathered together at Carrington, six days before United face Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday, so that directors Jason Wilcox and Marc Armstrong, as well as Ruben Amorim, could give an overview of how the summer had gone. This is the first time United have started a season with the head coach and football structure both chosen by Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s INEOS regime, after all.\nAdvertisement\nBerrada also issued a new set of three core values to underpin their work, describing this particular treble as very relevant to United\u2019s history and future. \u201cBadge, bravery and spirit,\u201d he said.\nBravery came down to staying resilient in difficult times, he added, according to those in the room. He explained that nobody should be bigger than the badge. He implored people to engage the same spirit that Sir Matt Busby and Jimmy Murphy had when rebuilding United in the wake of the Munich air disaster. A rousing video capturing United\u2019s heritage accompanied Berrada\u2019s talk.\nEric Cantona and Roy Keane were invoked by Berrada as examples; two legends who each possessed an uncompromising, combustible style. Judging by Amorim\u2019s disclosure of Ratcliffe\u2019s aversion to \u201cbulls***\u201d in an interview earlier this summer, there can be little debate about what he meant. Later Amorim also listed other players who were not stars who should serve as role models for their application and dedication. His point being, as interpreted by those listening, that a team requires togetherness and a meshing of personalities.\nStaff were even given metal water bottles with BADGE, BRAVERY, SPIRIT on them to take home as a reminder of the motto.\nThe audience was also instructed to scan a QR code on their phones. This took them to a simple question: what do you need to deliver on these three principles?\nPeople punched in their responses and everyone could see them pop up anonymously on their screens in real time.\nIn the main, the feedback was benign. \u201cIntegrity\u201d, \u201ccollaboration\u201d, \u201chard work\u201d. Colleagues discussed their thoughts with others around them. The atmosphere marked a significant turning point from previous meetings over the last 18 months, which could be resentful and tense due to the drastic measures being announced.\nAdvertisement\nBut there were still nods to the realities of Ratcliffe\u2019s regime, which has made a third of the workforce redundant and dramatically changed conditions through cost-cutting.\n\u201cStop being cheapskates,\u201d was one reply. \u201cWe have little trust in leadership,\u201d was another. Complaints were made about senior managers having allegedly no influence over budget control and a lack of autonomy, while it was claimed that the approvals process for spending was taking too long. Calls were made for a return of the staff restaurant at Old Trafford, which was removed by INEOS, and concern was raised that a relocation of employees to Carrington could cause a class divide between peer groups, plus the canteen at the complex being split in two between players and non-football staff.\nBerrada was reading these messages and though the majority were constructive, his face appeared to react to each sharp critique. \u201cInteresting,\u201d he said afterwards, in a light-hearted tone that drew a laugh from the audience.\nPerhaps in some people\u2019s minds was the Friday three days prior, when Ratcliffe had visited Carrington for the grand opening of the new main building, which had been extensively reshaped and improved over the last year to the tune of \u00a350million ($67.9m). Staff had begun to migrate on Wednesday and Thursday.\nUnited\u2019s co-owner being on site led to a sweep of the open-plan offices to ensure no untidiness, especially that desks were clear of empty cups, believed to be a particular Ratcliffe peeve.\nParking space is at a premium, meaning several who drove in had to pull up on the road outside and walk in, even though only around 300 people attended in person. London staff were allowed to dial in remotely but that still left a large portion of the 650 or so workforce absent. The attendance was a far cry from the approximate 800 who attended the first all-staff meeting helmed by Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford at Old Trafford in January 2024.\nAdvertisement\nSo, for all the enthusiasm around United\u2019s summer business, and attempts to stir strong rhetoric, internal issues remain. Outside the club, among the fanbase, emotions are conflicted too.\nOn August 5, the 1958 group, which has organised a series of protests over the past few years, called for another march against the ownership ahead of the Arsenal game. A week later, following the results of a fan survey, they postponed the protest.\nIn between, United confirmed the signing of Benjamin Sesko in a deal worth a potential \u20ac85m (\u00a373.4m; $99.5m). For those on the fringes of the fan protest, maintaining the anger to rally against those in charge probably becomes harder in those circumstances. The 1958 said the \u201cfight\u201d for accountability on decisions will continue.\nSesko got a mention during the staff meeting. Wilcox, United\u2019s director of football, said \u201cBenji\u201d had shown tremendous desire to join the club, claiming he had rejected further offers of a higher salary from Newcastle United even after he had agreed personal terms at Old Trafford (a point disputed by people at Newcastle). Sesko played his first game for Manchester United on Sunday, featuring against the under-21s on a training pitch at Carrington.\nAmorim took up the theme of only having players who want to be at United, praising Bruno Fernandes for rejecting the financial allure of Al Hilal in May. Fernandes could have earned much more money in Saudi Arabia, Amorim told staff, but he chose to stay and he deserves respect and love for that as United\u2019s captain. Amorim explained that paying players what they want does not tally with running a business, so Fernandes had shown leadership in this case.\nAmorim believes the new building will help keep players happy. He gave the example that, after training on Sunday, he walked through the facility to find four players enjoying a game of snooker. Armstrong, picking up on what seemed a running misunderstanding, interrupted to say he would have to explain to Amorim the difference between snooker and pool, which was what the players were actually playing. There was laughter at this lighter moment.\nThere is also a barber shop, an F1 simulator and a PlayStation in social areas at Carrington, additions that Amorim thinks will encourage players to spend more time there and develop better bonds with team-mates.\nAdvertisement\nAmorim said he had come in on a day off to talk to staff, something that would have given him trepidation last season. He explained there were times when he did not look forward to arriving at work, which landed a little awkwardly for some of those listening who have seen colleagues leave who used to be thrilled to turn up at Old Trafford or Carrington.\nBut he won people round by saying he gets excited about clocking in now, and how the revamped layout at United\u2019s training complex allows him to connect with other staff at the club across all departments in a way that was impossible before. He explained how that day he passed so many colleagues as he walked the main building, and had engaging conversations with them, adding he is keen to integrate, rather than being separate.\nAmorim\u2019s mood last season was linked to poor results. But with Sesko joining Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a transfer outlay surpassing \u00a3200million, he has more tools to find happiness on the pitch.\nThat spending, combined with talks on a possible move for Carlos Baleba at Brighton, is greater than what was anticipated at the start of the window and a reversal on the idea United needed to make sales first. It has led some with a line into the upper echelons of the club to believe Ratcliffe has sanctioned the push knowing Amorim needs a strong start to this campaign, otherwise faith in him and the football leadership will erode.\nThere is also Ratcliffe\u2019s pact with the Glazers to consider, with the Americans holding an option to force a sale of his shares should they wish and find a buyer. That is partly why the petrochemicals billionaire has, in view of at least one person at the club, decided it is \u201cnow or never\u201d.\nThere are similarities with Erik ten Hag\u2019s first campaign, which started with two defeats and prompted the hurried signings of Casemiro and Antony for more than \u00a3150m in the summer of 2022. The Glazers needed Champions League qualification to maintain a healthy valuation in the club they intended to sell.\nUnited\u2019s current hierarchy would argue their purchases have been sober and planned, but still it is a lot of money, five months on from Ratcliffe claiming United would have been \u201cbust by Christmas\u201d had they not cut jobs.\nAdvertisement\nThe merits of that imagery are now clear, but cash does remain an issue. United are using the revolving credit facility, and appear to have extended the borrowing capacity beyond the original \u00a3300m, but generating revenue in a year when there is no European broadcast income is essential.\nThat is where Armstrong, appointed from Paris Saint-Germain in February, comes in. United\u2019s chief business officer, who made a good impression during his speech, has brought all arms of income under his remit and is making a start on signing up sponsors.\nArmstrong told staff that United are on the verge of announcing three new partnerships, and his team had, across the last five months, agreed \u00a370m of deals.\nOne new name associated with United is Coca-Cola, which has become the club\u2019s official soft drink partner. The deal was announced on Wednesday, two days after Armstrong spoke, and is understood to be worth around \u00a31million per year.\nThe symbiosis of soft drink companies and United\u2019s football fortunes is not necessarily direct, but reshaping the squad to Amorim\u2019s designs does require funds from far and wide. United have taken a calculated risk by committing to extra spending now. United\u2019s head coach needs these players to perform.\nAdditional contributor: Adam Crafton\n(Top photo: Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Newcastle United centre-forward pursued by Liverpool thought it would be a good idea to remove himself from the limelight. The situation was increasingly tense, he knew that. The Liverpool Echo was already running an hour-by-hour analysis of the proposed transfer sensation. So the wanted and \u2018wantaway\u2019 striker went somewhere no one could see him \u2014 the cinema.\nAdvertisement\nIt was a Thursday afternoon and Albert Stubbins and his wife, Anne, sat contentedly in darkness through the matinee. When it was over, they took the bus home.\nAll the while, fever raged. Eighteen clubs were in contact with Newcastle about the transfer request Stubbins had submitted some 24 hours earlier. Stubbins, known for his deadly smoothness on the pitch \u2014 \u2018the Smiling Assassin\u2019 \u2014 was displaying some off it.\nAdmittedly, going to the pictures on the bus is a long way from Alexander Isak boarding a private jet to train alone in San Sebastian \u2014 prompting the exquisite \u2018Basque Separatist\u2019 headline on Tyneside \u2014 but the cases of Stubbins and Isak are sufficiently similar to bear comparison. They also tell us about how football\u2019s culture has changed.\nIn September 1946, there were two clubs leading the eager 18 for Stubbins\u2019 signature. One was Everton and, as in 2025 with Isak, the other was Liverpool. On hearing of Stubbins\u2019 request to leave St James\u2019 Park, representatives of both Merseyside clubs had scurried to the north east of England, and as Stubbins sat through his film, both were now ensconced in the boardroom with Newcastle United\u2019s principal director, Stan Seymour.\nThe Liverpool Echo\u2019s lead that Thursday was: \u2018Newcastle\u2019s Gold Rush: Everton and Liverpool Well Up in the Queue for Stubbins\u2019.\nBoth clubs quickly reached a financial figure Newcastle would accept, eliminating all others bar Sunderland. Newcastle\u2019s great rivals were on the telephone, bidding like this was some art auction.\nThe fee was \u00a313,000 and all three clubs said they would pay it. Only one transfer in European history had cost more \u2014 Arsenal paid \u00a314,000 to Wolves for Bryn Jones.\nBut that had been in 1938; this, literally, was a different world. This was the first full season after the Second World War. It was a new era for football, Europe, everywhere. The game, not war, was occupying thoughts and, reflecting that, attendances surged.\nAdvertisement\nEach Merseyside club wanted to be champions of England again, the first post-war champions. Everton had been champions in the last season before the war, 1938-39. Liverpool\u2019s last title was in 1923. Their urgency increased when losing 5-0 to Manchester United in their latest match.\nNewcastle United, meanwhile, were in the Second Division. But Seymour \u2014 \u2018Mr Newcastle\u2019 \u2014 understood the business of football, and in Stubbins, 27, Seymour knew Newcastle had the most valuable asset there is: a goalscorer in his prime.\nBorn in Wallsend on the River Tyne, Stubbins spent his early years in the United States in New York and Detroit. He returned aged 12 and was an avid Newcastle United fan. Stubbins was about 6ft (183cm) tall with size 11 boots at a time when the UK male average height was 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in. He was unusually fast and he was brave in front of goal. He had played 218 times for Newcastle and scored 237 goals. Famed for scoring hat-tricks, Stubbins accumulated 29 of them.\nThe goals came mainly in wartime football, but it was still a high standard. \u201cI can\u2019t say I found a lot of difference between wartime and peacetime football,\u201d he once said. He won one war-time England cap, but the formidable Tommy Lawton was England\u2019s No 9 then.\nAs Sir Bobby Robson, a future Newcastle United manager, put it in his memoir My Kind of Toon: \u201cAlbert Stubbins was the Alan Shearer of his day.\u201d Robson also said: \u201cAlbert was my first hero and my first heartbreak.\u201d\nOnce the \u00a313,000 fee had been agreed, Newcastle began calling local cinemas to see if Stubbins could be raised. He could not. A taxi was sent to his Wallsend home and returned empty. After four hours in the smoke-filled St James\u2019 boardroom, they started playing cards.\nStubbins was clearly aware of his value and of the interest, but he told the Daily Mail that night: \u201cI just went to the pictures with my wife and when I got home, a neighbour told me that I was wanted at the Park. So I just came back on the bus.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhen Stubbins finally arrived at St James\u2019, he was introduced to Liverpool chairman Bill McConnell and manager George Kay, and Everton\u2019s secretary-manager Theo Kelly. When asked by Seymour which club he would like to speak to first, Stubbins added to the day\u2019s theatre by replying: \u201cLet\u2019s flip a coin. Heads, Liverpool. Tails, Everton.\u201d\nHeads won. Sunderland, who had been Stubbins\u2019 first senior club as a youth \u2014 and Stubbins worked on Wearside as a shipyard draughtsman during the war \u2014 were discounted.\nAfter hearing what McConnell and Kay had to say about plans at Anfield, and already having friends in the Liverpool team such as Jack Balmer, Stubbins plumped for the Reds. \u201cIn the end, I never spoke to Everton because I was so impressed with Liverpool\u2019s offer,\u201d Stubbins later said.\nLike today, it is highly probable contact between Liverpool and Stubbins had been made quietly long before \u2014 this was his second transfer request. The delay enabled Newcastle to sign a new centre-forward, Middlesbrough\u2019s George Stobbart, the day before Stubbins\u2019 second request. Three weeks later, the \u00a313,000 received at St James\u2019 went on signing the brilliant Len Shackleton from Bradford Park Avenue. Stubbins had not had to force his way out, it was orchestrated. Newcastle did not bleat.\nThat said, to a 13-year-old Bobby Robson, \u201cwhen Newcastle sold him to Liverpool, I felt betrayed\u201d.\nHaving been in a Newcastle cinema on that Thursday afternoon, Stubbins was in Liverpool\u2019s starting XI at Bolton 48 hours later. It was a wet day, but 35,000 turned up at Burnden Park to see Stubbins, with the Liverpool Echo reporting: \u201cThe East Lancashire Road was crowded with traffic from Liverpool to Bolton.\u201d\nIt was beneath the headline: \u201cStubbins Winner in Mudlark\u201d. With the teams level at 1-1, Stubbins had scored in the 82nd minute. (Although Liverpool got a third in the last seconds, the headline will have been written before then.)\nAdvertisement\nIt was the perfect start. Pre-television, and because of the war, so many had travelled to see Liverpool\u2019s new striker because there was little or no footage of him. \u201cStubbins is a sizeable boy with a boxer\u2019s features and a raking stride,\u201d the Echo said. \u201cHe tells me he has no nickname, but it won\u2019t be long before his guinea gold locks get the inevitable \u2018Ginger\u2019 from Spion Kop.\u201d\nAnd the following Monday, good first impressions were reinforced: \u201cMake no mistake, Stubbins has class.\u201d\nThe effect of the hype was seen on Stubbins\u2019 home debut the next Saturday, against Everton. It was the first \u201call-in\u201d derby since before the war, and the local papers reported queues from 9.30am and the closing of the turnstiles at 2.30pm. It was 0-0.\nReports refer to queueing fans \u2014 one was James McDonald from Bootle, who had first seen Liverpool play \u201c50 years ago\u201d. He followed both them and Everton \u201cimpartially\u201d. Another was William Heap, a demobbed soldier who thought he could endure hours of waiting in the rain, given he had been at the Normandy landings. There was none of modern football\u2019s grinding self-importance.\nAt Bolton, Stubbins had scored the first of 24 goals in his first season. Liverpool were eighth. When he scored in a 4-1 win at Sunderland in December, Liverpool were second. By the end of May 1947, they were first, Stubbins scoring the decisive goal in a 2-1 win at Wolves. Liverpool were champions. The bus fares, the cinema tickets, the wait at St James\u2019, they had all been worth it.\nLiverpool had also reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, thanks to a Stubbins hat-trick in the last eight against Birmingham. It was the day he scored his \u2018Goal in the Snow\u2019, a diving header from a Billy Liddell cross that immediately entered Anfield folklore.\nNewcastle also reached the semi-final. A \u2018Stubbins final\u2019 was on, but both Liverpool and Newcastle lost. After Newcastle\u2019s defeat, captain Joe Harvey and Stubbins\u2019 replacement, Shackleton, went \u201con strike\u201d as Shackleton wrote in his autobiography. Promises from the club had not been kept. Isak will think it sounds familiar. \u201cWhat a story that was for the newspapers,\u201d Shackleton said.\nAlbert Stubbins was born #OnThisDay 104 years ago. Liverpool signed him from Newcastle in 1946 and here is that famous diving header in the snow. With Albert Stubbins goals, The Reds were on their way to another League title in 1947. #YNWA #LFC https://t.co/NP9HSwTgwX\n\u2014 \"YNWA\" The Story of Liverpool FC (@LFCHistoryShow) July 13, 2023\nIn his second season at Anfield, Stubbins again scored 24 goals. It was not enough to retain the title, though, and Liverpool dropped to 11th place.\nAdvertisement\nIt did not affect Stubbins\u2019 ballooning popularity. It was such that his name crossed into local culture \u2014 \u201cA-L-B-E-R-T, Albert Stubbins is the man for me,\u201d was a Merseyside playground chant. One who must have heard it as he grew up near Penny Lane was John Lennon.\nAs Stubbins and Isak might note, Lennon lived on Newcastle Road, at number nine. He was born on October 9 and later wrote #9 Dream, which appeared on his 1974 solo album Walls and Bridges. As a sleeve note illustration Lennon used a picture he had drawn as a boy of the Newcastle-Arsenal 1952 FA Cup final. In it is a Newcastle No 9, Jackie Milburn. \u201cIt\u2019s just a number that follows me around,\u201d Lennon said.\nPaul McCartney felt similarly, which is why, when the Beatles were compiling 71 names and faces to appear on the cover of their seminal Sgt Pepper album in 1967, the one footballer chosen was Albert Stubbins. The Beatles sent him a signed copy, McCartney sent him a telegram. \u201cWell done, Albert, for all those glorious years of football. Long may you bob and weave.\u201d\nStubbins was back on Tyneside then, working as a sports journalist. He had stayed six full seasons at Anfield, but although he played in the 1950 FA Cup final, there were contractual issues as early as 1948, plus injuries. He moved back to Tyneside and trained with Gateshead FC; in December 1950, Stubbins missed a Liverpool game for \u201cdomestic reasons\u201d; in February 1951, Middlesbrough offered Liverpool \u00a318,000, but the transfer didn\u2019t happen.\nIn September 1953, aged 34, Stubbins left Liverpool to sign for non-League Ashington in the north east. For a fee of \u00a33,000, the Morpeth Herald reported: \u201cAlbert is coming as a player-coach and in the position of centre-half, where he always wanted to play.\u201d\nThat may have been news to some, but then the Liverpool Daily Post did call Stubbins \u201cthe most enigmatic fellow ever known in soccer\u201d, shortly before he departed.\nAfter retirement from playing, in 1960 Stubbins briefly returned to the U.S. to coach the New York Americans in the American Soccer League. A New York Times interview from then says: \u201c\u2018Soccer\u2019, Stubbins explains patiently to a non-expert inquirer, is played with eleven men on a side.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe was back reporting on north-east action soon and did so for decades \u2014 there is a photograph of Stubbins with a young Paul Gascoigne at Newcastle\u2019s training ground.\nStubbins stayed in touch with his Liverpool 1947 title-winning colleague, Bob Paisley, who was also from the north east. Stubbins was a living link between two football-obsessed northern English cities, one of many overlaps between the clubs, who do not share some ancient animosity, despite what August 2025 might suggest.\nKevin Keegan could tell you that \u2014 the legendary Liverpool player and revered Newcastle player and manager had his famous 1984 \u2018helicopter testimonial\u2019 at St James\u2019 against Liverpool. Rafa Benitez is a more recent addition, beloved by both fanbases. Granted, Isak will not be quite so warmly embraced in two places should this acrimonious move be concluded.\nStubbins died in late December 2002. His funeral in Tynemouth was attended by Robson. In Newcastle United\u2019s next home game, black armbands were worn by both teams in Stubbins\u2019 honour.\nThe visitors were Liverpool.\n(Top photos: Dennis Oulds/Central Press/Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)"

      "text": "A new Champions League season is upon us. After Paris Saint-Germain finally got their hands on the trophy for the first time last campaign, clubs will once again start to battle it out to become football\u2019s kings of Europe.\nThe draw for the league phase, which begins on September 16, takes place on Thursday. With Tottenham Hotspur winning the Europa League last season, there will be six English teams among the 36 sides competing in this year\u2019s tournament.\nAdvertisement\nThe Athletic has put together the all-important details for the league-phase draw.\nRemind me again, what is the format?\nLast season, the Champions League introduced a new 36-team format which is set to be in place until at least 2027.\nRather than facing the same three sides twice as happened in the old group-stage version, this league phase has each team play eight games, all against different opponents.\nFor the draw, the clubs are split into four pots of eight based on their UEFA coefficient \u2014 a ranking system based on a team\u2019s performances in UEFA competitions across the previous five seasons that helps determine their opponents for the league phase. Teams from the same country cannot play each other in this opening stage.\nFollowing the conclusion of the league phase in January, the top eight teams in the table progress automatically into the round of 16 in March. Those that finish ninth to 24th will contest eight home-and-away play-offs in February to decide the other qualifiers for the last 16, with the eight beaten teams being eliminated from Europe for the rest of the season.\nTeams are paired against two teams from each of the four pots, one home and one away. However, clubs from the same association cannot be drawn against each other, and nobody can face more than two opponents from the same association.\nThis changes from the knockout round, where teams from the same country can meet.\nDid the league format work last season?\nThere were some thrills during the inaugural league phase, yes. Unexpectedly, holders Real Madrid, along with Manchester City, Bayern Munich, PSG and Juventus all finished in the play-off spots.\nIt did create more interesting and competitive first-stage ties. Many argued a negative of the traditional group format was that there were too many dead-rubber games in the final set of matches with the two two places in each pool already decided. But there were plenty of surprise results in the league phase \u2014 Sporting\u2019s 4-1 thumping of City in Lisbon, Aston Villa beating Bayern at home and Dortmund thrashing Barcelona 3-1 to name just three.\nAdvertisement\nThe final gameday of the league phase, with all 18 matches taking place at the same time, also created drama as the league table changed multiple times and there was uncertainty around whether some of the aforementioned big-name clubs would fail to make the knockout rounds.\nThe surprise league-phase results also made for interesting fixtures at the competition\u2019s business end: Liverpool finished top of the league having won their first seven games but got drawn against eventual winners PSG in a blockbuster last-16 tie after the latter came only 15th, losing three of their eight games, then beat fellow French side Brest in their play-off tie.\nWhich teams are in which pot for the league phase draw?\nClubs will play against two teams from each of the four pots in their eight games, facing one from each home and one away. However, sides from the same association cannot be drawn against each other at this stage, nor can you play more than two opponents from the same association.\nPot 1\nParis Saint-Germain (FRA)\nReal Madrid (ESP)\nManchester City (ENG)\nBayern Munich (GER)\nLiverpool (ENG)\nInter (ITA)\nChelsea (ENG)\nBorussia Dortmund (GER)\nBarcelona (ESP)\nPot 2\nArsenal (ENG)\nBayer Leverkusen (GER)\nAtletico Madrid (ESP)\nBenfica (POR)\nAtalanta (ITA)\nVillarreal (ESP)\nJuventus (ITA)\nFrankfurt (GER)\nClub Brugge (BEL)\nPot 3\nTottenham Hotspur (ENG)\nPSV (NED)\nAjax (NED)\nNapoli (ITA)\nSporting CP (POR)\nOlympiacos (GRE)\nSlavia Prague (CZE)\nBodo/Glimt (NOR)\nMarseille (FRA)\nPot 4\nCopenhagen (DEN)\nMonaco (FRA)\nGalatasaray (TUR)\nUnion Saint-Gilloise (BEL)\nQarabag (AZE)\nAthletic Club (ESP)\nNewcastle United (ENG)\nPafos (CYP)\nKairat Almaty (KAZ)\nWhy is the draw digital?\nIt\u2019s to save time. UEFA says that if the entire draw were to be completed manually, around 1,000 balls would be spread across at least 36 bowls up on stage and the whole process would take more than three hours. Last year\u2019s digital draw, using UEFA\u2019s automated software, took around 30 minutes, starting when guest Cristiano Ronaldo pressed a button to reveal City\u2019s eight opponents.\nAdvertisement\nUEFA uses software from AE Live, a company which has provided sporting draw services for more than 20 years, including for the FA Cup, FIFA, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and CAF, African football\u2019s governing body.\nWhen will the fixtures be announced?\nThe tournament\u2019s fixture list, including match dates and kick-off times, will be published no later than this Saturday, August 30, allowing time for the draws of UEFA\u2019s two other annual club competitions on Friday.\nThe league phase matchdays start on September 16-18 and conclude with matchday eight on January 28.\nHow can we follow it?\nThe Athletic will be blogging the draw live and it will be streamed on UEFA\u2019s official website and YouTube channel. Viewers from the United Kingdom can also find it on TNT Sports and for those in the United States, it will be on Paramount.\nWhen and where is the draw?\nThe draw will take place on Thursday, August 28, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco, at 5pm BST (12pm ET).\nA day later, the draws for the Europa League and Conference League will happen at the same venue, starting at noon BST.\n(Top photo: Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Perhaps this particular discourse\u2019s revival was an inevitable consequence of U.S. Soccer publishing a roster including the surname \u201cKlinsmann.\u201d Perhaps it was Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s pet cause entering Tuesday\u2019s media availability, held to address his U.S. men\u2019s national team squad for the September friendlies. Most likely, it\u2019s a less conspiratorial third factor most responsible for the reopening of the longtime questions about MLS\u2019s role in shaping the USMNT.\nAdvertisement\nThroughout his tenure, which is nearing its anniversary, Pochettino has had to survey a player pool humbled by failure at last year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica and find a squad capable of doing the program proud at the 2026 World Cup. That previous core was dominated by players who play for some of Europe\u2019s most notable clubs. Now, key members of that group \u2014 headlined by Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Johnny Cardoso and Antonee Robinson \u2014 will miss the fifth-to-last camp before the World Cup comes to Canada, Mexico and the United States.\nMany of the players selected in those same roles hail from MLS. Several helped the USMNT reach the final of this summer\u2019s Gold Cup, where they lost to a full-strength Mexico. At present, Pochettino estimates that his player pool includes \u201c60 to 65\u201d options, perhaps a worryingly bloated scale with a World Cup just under 10 months away. Still, his recent preference for options in MLS has sparked debate about the efficacy of a league \u2014 still well outside of the world\u2019s absolute top circuits \u2014 to prepare players to excel on the grandest stage.\n\u201cWe need to give MLS the value, because I think competing there, I think players can show that they can perform in the national team,\u201d Pochettino said on Tuesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s not necessary to move from MLS to Europe. Because sometimes MLS, under my assessment, maybe is more competitive than some leagues in Europe.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sentiment sure to rile certain sects of U.S. fandom who long craved a manager with Pochettino\u2019s European pedigree and likely expected that he would maintain a different preference. It\u2019s one that stands in direct opposition to what was voiced by Jurgen Klinsmann during his tenure as U.S. manager. Upon succeeding Bob Bradley in the role, Klinsmann aggressively looked for dual-national options (largely those in Germany) to bolster his player pool. He also openly questioned MLS\u2019s caliber and often mused about whether a league outside of the game\u2019s highest levels offered proper schooling for a program determined to return to the business end of a World Cup.\nAdvertisement\nWhen star players Jozy Altidore, Michael Bradley and Clint Dempsey moved to MLS, Klinsmann questioned the ambition of their moves. Many fans embraced the coach\u2019s narrative. Any subsequent roster released over the past decade including a healthy dosage of MLS talent was scrutinized, with many vocal detractors fixating on which MLS players were called in with minimal critical thought about the state of the pool.\nNever mind, of course, that Klinsmann\u2019s infamous omission of Landon Donovan saw him opt for Brad Davis, a career MLS winger, or that eight of the 13 USMNT players whom Klinsmann played for at least 100 minutes at the 2014 World Cup were on MLS rosters. It\u2019s a talking point that has echoed loudly and often since his dismissal in late 2016.\nMLS is inarguably in a better state now, over a decade on from Klinsmann\u2019s group reaching the round of 16 in Brazil. The league restructured its approach to youth development in the late 2000s and has since dependably produced MLS-level players throughout its 30-team ecosystem. Some, like Tyler Adams and Ricardo Pepi, began their pro careers with their boyhood clubs and have remained relevant for European clubs and the USMNT alike. Others, like McKennie, Gio Reyna and Chris Richards, spent time in MLS academies before going pro across the Atlantic.\nThat isn\u2019t to say that MLS has cracked it, of course; that work remains wholly in process. What\u2019s different now compared to Klinsmann\u2019s tenure is that MLS has closed the gap some and is more comparable to some of Europe\u2019s more famous leagues beyond the Big Five. That\u2019s how Pochettino sees it.\n\u201cWe have some players competing in different leagues [that] maybe are not so competitive,\u201d Pochettino said, \u201cor in (a league that) every single week compete(s) in the same way that you compete in MLS every single week \u2026 \u2018Oh, if you play in a team in Europe, you are above the players that are in MLS.\u2019 That is not the way to assess.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThere\u2019s no definitive pecking order for the world\u2019s top leagues, but Opta has a formula that tries to compare circuits from across the world. As of June, Opta ranked MLS as the 12th-strongest league in the world via its data-driven Power Rankings, which averages the 1-to-100 ratings of all teams within a league. MLS\u2019s score of 78.5 puts it in close proximity to Liga MX and the first divisions in Argentina, the Netherlands, Japan, Croatia and Denmark. The English Championship ranks sixth, perhaps surprisingly ahead of all of those leagues as well as Portugal\u2019s first division.\nIt\u2019s another data point to suggest that MLS is at least of a competitive caliber similar to those leagues that are more widely agreed to be definitive members of the club game\u2019s second tier. The league itself has its trademark features and flaws. Many teams still play with a dedicated No. 10, a fading facet of the game in Europe. The league\u2019s rules encourage teams to prioritize investing in attacking players. To briskly assess, that leaves MLS with a lower standard of defending than other leagues in that \u201cBest of the Rest\u201d category.\nThose roster rules also encourage MLS teams to lean into domestic talent, an obvious benefit for players from the U.S. and Canada. With a limit on international signings and designated players, teams will be more inclined to consider domestic options in luxury roles (like striker, attacking midfield and central midfield) than leagues better equipped to spend throughout their entire squad.\nIt\u2019s a factor that has helped bolster Diego Luna\u2019s case for inclusion. After impressing Pochettino in January camp, the 21-year-old has benefited from consistent starts as a playmaking midfielder for Real Salt Lake. So while Luna received some interest from clubs in Mexico and Europe this summer, leaving a stable situation less than a year before the World Cup looked like too great a gamble.\n\u201cWhen it comes to moving teams with such a small amount of time coming into the World Cup, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Luna told The Athletic in July. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to play, when you\u2019re going to break through, how you\u2019re going to make it work, or if it\u2019s just going to stall for six, eight months. You don\u2019t know if you have that type of time right now. There\u2019s a bunch that plays into it, because the World Cup is a huge thing, and everybody wants to be a part of it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a perk that helped turn Paxten Aaronson\u2019s head, too. The 22-year-old left his boyhood Philadelphia Union for Eintracht Frankfurt in January 2023, playing far more on Eredivisie loan stints with Vitesse and Utrecht. Aaronson was selected for the Gold Cup squad, but earned just 11 minutes across two late-game shifts. Luna and Malik Tillman were preferred, while older brother Brenden also saw meaningful time in the same roles. Those 18 months in Holland still hadn\u2019t raised his level enough in Pochettino\u2019s eyes.\nThe Colorado Rapids came calling after the Gold Cup, fresh off of their $8 million transfer of U.S. international Djordje Mihailovic to Toronto FC. The attack needed a new key figure, and the club, typically frugal operating under the Kroenkes\u2019 stewardship, had new resources to reinvest. After speaking with head coach Chris Armas and chief soccer officer Padraig Smith, Aaronson surprised the USMNT ecosystem by returning to MLS and on a $7 million initial transfer fee.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll challenge me as a young player to come into a team, to fight for trophies, to get better in roles and aspects maybe Europe can\u2019t give me,\u201d said Aaronson, who was not included by Pochettino for the upcoming window. \u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s the main thing that attracted me to it: coming to a team, being a presence to try to win trophies and make myself better and also everybody around me.\u201d\nIn 14 Bundesliga appearances, Frankfurt predominantly played Aaronson as a right winger; however, Aaronson and Armas both stated that they saw the player\u2019s best role as being a central one. It\u2019s a better fit for how he reads the game and how Armas hopes to get the most out of his new rising star. It\u2019s also a role with vital responsibilities in all phases, and one Aaronson would\u2019ve struggled to get meaningful minutes in if he hadn\u2019t moved to a club with that specific need.\nSome of this is also intrinsic. Right now, a number of prominent players on the USMNT who are in Europe are rotational pieces, often alternating between the lineup and the bench while playing the game\u2019s less sexy roles. For players like Luna and Aaronson, who want to get a central figure\u2019s time on the ball but didn\u2019t come up in a European academy, MLS is a credible option where teams may build around them and look at them for well over 2,000 minutes in key positions. That\u2019s invaluable preparation for an aspiring national team member.\nStill, it\u2019s curious to see Columbus homegrown Sean Zawadzki \u2014 who mostly plays as a center back \u2014 preferred by Pochettino for a midfield role over former Crew teammate Aidan Morris, who won two MLS Cups and was among the EFL Championship\u2019s best two-way midfielders with Middlesbrough in 2024-25, or Tanner Tessmann, who left FC Dallas in 2021, captained the Olympic team and now anchors the Lyon midfield (and that\u2019s to say nothing of McKennie, Cardoso or Musah). Another Crew player, Max Arfsten, has been wholly unconvincing as a makeshift fullback and continues to play as an attacking wingback for his club. And yet, his track record of inclusion suggests he may be Pochettino\u2019s preferred alternative to Robinson in a back four.\nThese selection debates are eternally worth having about every international squad, including the one Pochettino called in for September. They\u2019re also more productive than blindly writing off all players from one league \u2014 especially one that, as of recently, has seen its players (like Luna and goalkeeper Matt Freese) provide the USMNT with needed moments of excitement in what\u2019s been a rather bleak stretch for the program. No matter what the public sentiment may be regarding MLS and its presence across the USMNT, Pochettino has shown he is more than comfortable backing the domestic league\u2019s strength as he combs through his player pool at this most vital of junctures.\n(Top photo: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Manchester United have completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig on a five-year deal running to 2030.\nSesko is set to be unveiled to supporters at Old Trafford during Saturday\u2019s pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.\nThe Athletic reported on Thursday Manchester United had reached an agreement in principle with Leipzig for the signing of Sesko, with a deal worth \u20ac76.5million (\u00a366.4m; $89.1m) and \u20ac8.5m in add-ons in place.\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle United have also pursued the 22-year-old this summer and had a bid of \u20ac82.5m plus \u20ac2.5m in add-ons accepted by Leipzig on Tuesday.\nBut the Slovenia international favoured a move to Manchester United, despite Newcastle providing Champions League football in 2025-26.\nIt was only ever United. pic.twitter.com/JpzKueYSIc\n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd) August 9, 2025\nManchester United also managed to secure a lower guaranteed fee than Newcastle and will be happy if the contingency payments are achieved.\nIn a statement released by United, Sesko said: \u201cThe history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.\n\u201cWhen we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.\n\u201cFrom the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.\n\u201cI cannot wait to start learning from Ruben (Amorim, head coach) and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.\u201d\nUnited\u2019s director of football Jason Wilcox added: \u201cBenjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.\n\u201cWe have followed Benjamin\u2019s career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.\n\u201cWorking under the guidance of Ruben and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-\nclass potential.\n\u201cThe desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSesko scored 21 goals in all competitions for Leipzig last season. He has recorded has recorded 39 goals and eight assists in 87 appearances for the Bundesliga team since joining from RB Salzburg in 2023.\nSesko is United\u2019s latest addition to their forward line this summer, following the signings of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.\nWhy Sesko?\nAnalysis by Carl Anka from \u2018Are Manchester United right to pick Benjamin Sesko as their main striker target?\u2019\nIn 2025, Sesko has developed into a sledgehammer of a striker. He combines straight-line speed, powerful finishing and sheer bloody-mindedness to become a forward that centre-backs hate playing against.\nA speedy, 195cm/6ft 5in striker who spent a brief period tearing up the Austrian league before moving to the Bundesliga, Sesko has earned some comparisons to Erling Haaland. Sesko is not quite at that level, but has plenty of the raw materials to suggest he could reach it.\nHis shot map from 2023-24 illustrates a striker happy to go for goal wherever and whenever. Left foot, right foot, headers. Long-range cannons and plenty of pingers within the penalty box.\nSesko is a confident striker, but is lacking the consistency needed to become a prolific one. He is prone to forcing the issue when in front of goal, hammering the ball with extra venom when trying to make it through a crowd of bodies.\nHis right-footed finishes when shooting from the left half-space need work, as does his movement within the six-yard box, but he has the presence and quickness of mind to have defenders regularly second-guessing themselves.\nHow much will Manchester United\u2019s new attack cost?\nAnalysis from football finance writer Chris Weatherspoon\nSpending a little over \u00a366m on Sesko takes United\u2019s summer outlay on guaranteed fees alone to \u00a3193.9m across three forwards, with a further \u00a313.4m potentially payable to clubs in future add-ons.\nAdvertisement\nTag on estimated agent fees and the four per cent transfer levy all Premier League clubs have to pay on incoming transfers, and their spending on new players is easily over \u00a3200m.\nIn that sense, this is just what we\u2019ve come to expect from United, both before and after Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s February 2024 arrival. Using financial years spanning July 1 to June 30, United spent \u00a3247.4m in 2022-23, \u00a3220.7m in 2023-24 and an enormous \u00a3343.5m in 2024-25 \u2014 the largest single-season spend in club history and the third largest in English football history (albeit that includes Matheus Cunha\u2019s arrival, as he signed up in June).\nAs with every transfer, United won\u2019t take the full hit of Sesko immediately, with his transfer costs spread across the duration of the contract he signs. But it all adds up to huge ongoing expenditure from a club whose transfer fee amortisation bill (the annual impact of spreading transfer fees) was already nearing \u00a3200m.\nUnited have fewer PSR troubles than once thought but cash has been rather tighter at Old Trafford recently. Payment terms on Sesko are unknown, but Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s deals are staggered across three and four instalments respectively, helping United manage liquidity. As well, as The Athletic detailed yesterday, there are other funding options available to the club to help foot a transfer bill which shows little sign of reducing.\n(Top photo: Manchester United FC)"

      "text": "It is just 90 days since Paris Saint-Germain claimed their first Champions League with a 5-0 thrashing of Inter\u2026 and now the draw for the 2025-26 edition is upon us.\nPlenty has changed in the interim. Managers have come and gone, hundreds of millions have been spent (and that\u2019s just at Liverpool) and Chelsea have somehow become world champions despite not even being part of Europe\u2019s elite competition last season.\nAdvertisement\nSo, with the Champions League line-up for this year\u2019s tournament now complete ahead of today\u2019s draw in Nyon, how do we assess each of them? This is our definitive \u2014 but also entirely subjective, and extremely debatable \u2014 ranking.\n36. Kairat Almaty\nThe most easterly team to ever reach this stage of the Champions League, Almaty is closer geographically to Tokyo than it is to England. It is further east, in terms of longitude, than Mumbai. But its remote location is potentially the best chance they have of causing any upsets: the Opta Power Rankings have them as the 473rd best team in the world, which puts them one place below Italian Serie B outfit Monza, and below Luton Town.\n35. Qarabag\nQarabag have only been in the group stages of the Champions League once before, and this is where the \u2018new\u2019 format has its advantages for the smaller sides: they\u2019ve got more of a chance of making the knockouts than when the Azerbaijanis were drawn against Roma, Chelsea and Atletico Madrid in 2017-18. They also have the longest-serving manager in the competition, Gurban Gurbanov having been in charge since 2008.\n34. Pafos\nAnother Champions League debutant, Pafos FC are a pretty remarkable story, if only because they were only formed two days before the 2014 World Cup, the result of a merger between AEP Paphos and AEK Kouklia in the Cypriot second division. Owned by Russian billionaire Sergey Lomakin, Pafos beat Red Star Belgrade in the qualifiers thanks to a dramatic goal from Brazilian winger Jaja. He\u2019s not the only Brazilian in their side: you\u2019ll probably be more familiar with David Luiz, who signed for them this summer.\n33. Bodo/Glimt\nThe northernmost team in Champions League history, Bodo/Glimt have become a relative stalwart of the more minor European competitions in recent years, probably best known for humiliating Jose Mourinho\u2019s Roma in the Conference League group stages in 2021. Managed by Kjetil Knutsen, perennially linked with jobs in England, the Norwegian side are the definition of a banana skin draw for teams not keen on playing football in the Arctic Circle.\nAdvertisement\n32. Copenhagen\nOne of the more interesting, low-key transfers of the summer was Youssoufa Moukoko\u2019s move to Copenhagen: once thought of as a wunderkind at Borussia Dortmund, the striker\u2019s star has fallen and this feels like it could be something of a reset. Few will fancy them to progress, but they did get to the knockout rounds in 2023-24, so they\u2019re a potential outside bet to qualify.\n31. Olympiacos\nConference League winners in 2024, Olympiacos were Greek champions last season after what was, for them at least, an unthinkable dry spell of two seasons without a league title. They\u2019re enjoying an uncharacteristic period of managerial stability (this is Jose Luis Mendilibar\u2019s third season in charge), their squad is a mishmash of names you half-recognise. Gelson Martins! Roman Yaremchuk! Remy Cabella!\n30. Slavia Prague\nAutomatic qualifiers after winning the Czech title last season, this is Slavia Prague\u2019s first appearance in the Champions League proper since 2019-20. Without wishing to be unkind, they will be the sort of team the big teams will hope to get: a manageable away trip for most teams, against a side they will expect to beat with relative ease.\n29. Club Brugge\nClub Brugge surprisingly got to the last 16 of the Champions League last season, before they were thrashed by Aston Villa. But since then they have lost three key players \u2014 Ardon Jashari, Maxim De Cuyper and Chemsdine Talbi \u2014 and winger Christos Tzolis could be on his way out too. Given that level of upheaval, even being at this stage is a success.\n28. Galatasaray\nGalatasaray are, quite rightly, proud of the fact that they\u2019re the only Turkish side to ever win a European trophy, and while they\u2019re very unlikely to double that tally this season, they are a decent bet to qualify. They have lost just seven league games over the last three seasons, and with Victor Osimhen now signed up permanently and Leroy Sane feeding him from the wing, they will be a lively proposition.\n27. Union SG\nUnion Saint-Gilloise finished the regular Belgian season in third place, 13 points behind Genk\u2026 but still emerged champions, thanks to the labyrinthine structure of the Belgian play-offs. But they remain one of the more remarkable success stories of European football, that title being their first since 1935. This will be their first ever appearance in the Champions League: how extraordinary it would be if they go one step further.\nAdvertisement\n26. Benfica\nBenfica\u2019s capacity for regeneration is remarkable, usually losing at least one big player a year (it was Alvaro Carreras this summer, off to Real Madrid for \u20ac50m), and still consistently making the knockout stages of European competitions. With the exciting Greek forward Vangelis Pavlidis leading the line this time, they\u2019re in with a chance of extending that record.\n25. Sporting\nLast season Sporting were almost completely derailed by the departure of Ruben Amorim to Manchester United: they had taken 10 points from their first four Champions League games before he left, but in their remaining four only managed one point, scraping into the playoffs where they were beaten by Borussia Dortmund. They still managed to win the Portuguese title and have some talents such as defender Ousmane Diomande, but the question this season is how they will cope without Viktor Gyokeres\u2019s 54 goals in all competitions.\n24. Monaco\nIf you want eye-catching signings that could go either way, Monaco is the place to look this summer. They brought in Paul Pogba, Ansu Fati and Eric Dier, the first two of whom are perhaps the epitome of \u2018high upside\u2019 recruits. Perhaps their success will rest on whether they keep hold of exciting winger Maghnes Akliouche and midfielder Soungoutou Magassa, who at the time of writing are still there, but that could change by transfer deadline day.\n23. Villarreal\nThe question about Villarreal this season is whether they will have enough punch up front, following the departure of Thierno Barry to Everton and the imminent transfer of Yeremy Pino to Crystal Palace. They finished fifth in La Liga last season, their best for some time, but you wonder whether they will be able to repeat that.\n22. Borussia Dortmund\nBorussia Dortmund\u2019s status as Germany\u2019s second club has slipped significantly in the last couple of years, but Niko Kovac stabilised them last season after a difficult start. It will be interesting to see how Jobe Bellingham fits in after treading the same path as his brother, and centre-forward Serhou Guirassy could score plenty this season.\n21. Ajax\nAjax only needed six points from their final five games to wrap up the Eredivisie title last season, but somehow managed to make a mess of it, leading to coach Francesco Farioli tearfully resigning. John Heitinga has returned to replace the Italian, but with a relatively uninspiring squad, will they have much impact in Europe?\n20. Eintracht Frankfurt\nIn the last two windows they have lost Omar Marmoush and Hugo Ekitike, their bank balance thus bulging, and their recruits have mostly been \u2018shrewd\u2019, relatively low-key additions from other Bundesliga teams. Therefore, they\u2019re one of the more interesting sides in the Champions League this season: will they be able to cope with so much change?\nAdvertisement\n19. Marseille\nLast season\u2019s non-PSG Ligue 1 title winners (they finished second, 19 points behind the champions, in what was essentially a different division) still have Roberto De Zerbi in charge. Whatever happens, it won\u2019t be dull.\n18. Atalanta\nAre Atalanta a little high, considering they\u2019re a team managed by Ivan Juric, who won two of his 16 games in charge of Southampton last season? Perhaps, but they are a team who have constantly surprised European competition over the last few years. The question is whether they will be able to cope without the architect of their recent success, Gian Piero Gasperini.\n17. Newcastle United\nFootball fans across the continent are giddy with anticipation to see how Alexander Isak will get on as he returns to the Champions League with Newcastle. No wait, that line was written in July, scrap that. Yep, Newcastle remain a bit of an unknown quantity until they know if they\u2019ll have Isak or indeed any striker of note. Should get an easier draw than last time, at least.\n16. PSV\nAfter dramatically winning the Dutch title on the final day of last season, this PSV squad has undergone some significant changes, with Malik Tillman, Noa Lang and Johan Bakayoko all departing. One to keep an eye on is winger Ruben van Bommel, who shares his father Mark\u2019s name, but not many of his playing characteristics.\n15. Tottenham Hotspur\nWhat on earth to expect from last season\u2019s Two-Face; i.e. the Europa League winners or the 17th-best team in the Premier League? Well, goals from set pieces presumably, under new boss Thomas Frank. There\u2019ll be specific tactical plans tailored for individual matches too, in a bold new brainwave. Frank\u2019s first venture into the Champions League will be fascinating, although a small squad may hinder him.\n14. Athletic Club\nYou could make a decent argument that the most significant signing of the summer in Spain, maybe even beyond, was not a new arrival, but Nico Williams agreeing to stay in Bilbao. It was assumed that he would be off to Barcelona, but now that he has stayed, Athletic will back themselves to qualify, maybe even for an automatic spot in the knockout phase.\n13. Juventus\nNot the force they were. Scraped into the Champions League on the final day by finishing fourth in Serie A, while they lost to PSV in the knockout phase play-offs in last year\u2019s Champions League. Difficult to envisage anything much better under Igor Tudor, although Jonathan David and Joao Mario are decent additions.\nAdvertisement\n12. Bayer Leverkusen\nPlenty of clubs have undergone significant change this summer, but perhaps none more than Bayer Leverkusen. Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Granit Xhaka, Jonathan Tah and, most significantly, Xabi Alonso have all gone. Nobody expects Erik ten Hag to recreate Alonso\u2019s success, but will he be able to even get close to it after all of this disruption?\n11. Inter\nIt was only a few short months ago that Inter were in the Champions League final, but the prospects of a repeat look far-fetched. PSG made Inter look like Dad\u2019s Army that night, although the departure of head coach Simone Inzaghi hasn\u2019t been followed by a dismantling of that squad. New boss Cristian Chivu has added a few younger faces, but Inter remain a big unknown due to that dugout change.\n10. Atletico Madrid\nAlmost guaranteed to impressively navigate the group stage while going under everyone\u2019s radar, then when the draw for the last 16 is made they\u2019re described as \u201creally tough opposition, that\u2019s not an easy draw for Team X, you know exactly what you\u2019re going to get with a Diego Simeone team\u201d. And then Atletico will heroically lose on penalties.\n9. Napoli\nThe 2023 quarter-finalists look a decent bet to match that this time around, with Antonio Conte still in charge having led the team to the Scudetto last season. Conte does not have a glorious history in the Champions League but he has kept his title-winning team together and added Kevin De Bruyne. Either way, expect a rowdy Naples to be the proverbial \u2018tough place to go\u2019.\n8. Chelsea\nChelsea are back in the Champions League after two seasons away, their longest gap since the pre-Roman Abramovich era. In those two years they\u2019ve proved their mettle by winning a prestigious new competition, but aside from their Conference League success they also won the Club World Cup. Dark horses.\n7. Arsenal\nQuarter-finalists two years ago, semi-finalists last year\u2026 what chance of Arsenal, just like in the Premier League, making almost continual progress in Europe, too? Well, their squad looks far better prepared to cope with the inevitable injury issues they\u2019ll suffer. Again, like in the league, their fate may depend on the form of Gyokeres.\n6. Manchester City\nCity have a complicated history with this competition and it remains an underachievement by Pep Guardiola to have only won it once in his nine years at the club. If Guardiola has fixed City\u2019s midfield, expect them to go all the way\u2026 to the quarter-finals where they\u2019ll lose to Real Madrid.\nAdvertisement\n5. Bayern Munich\nUntouchable in the Bundesliga and with one of the best front threes in Europe (Harry Kane, Luis Diaz and Michael Olise), but Bayern look a little light at the moment, an opinion voiced by Kane last week. While their knockout stage credentials are unquestionable, it\u2019s hard to make a case for this squad and manager Vincent Kompany taking them all the way.\n4. Liverpool\nThe English champions are probably the most likely winner from the Premier League. They sauntered through the early stages last year before getting pretty unlucky by drawing PSG in the last 16, but their squad is much improved now. Even their 16-year-old back-up players are utterly brilliant.\n3. Real Madrid\nThis is their competition. The 15-time tournament winners always turn up for the Champions League; they could field their under-16s and still make it to the knockout stages. They were undone by Arsenal last year, though, and have responded to a poor season the only way they know how, spending loads of money. Adding three new defenders and an Argentine wonderkid in Franco Mastantuono means they\u2019ll surely be there or thereabouts again.\n2. Barcelona\nThey haven\u2019t won the competition \u2013 or reached a final \u2013 for 10 years but if they continue last season\u2019s ridiculous goalscoring form (they were top scorers in the Champions League and netted 102 in La Liga, 24 more than anyone else), Lamine Yamal keeps being brilliant and tighten up their defence a little, it could be their year.\n1. Paris Saint-Germain\nThe reigning champions are undoubtedly favourites to retain their crown, with manager Luis Enrique and last season\u2019s squad still in place, plus they\u2019ve added defender Illia Zabarnyi and goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier. They were exposed by Chelsea\u2019s direct tactics at the Club World Cup and squeaked past several English teams in 2024-25, so they\u2019re not infallible. Plus how hungry are they for more?\n(Top photo: Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images)"

Their ground is in Cleethorpes, the seaside town next to the fish docks of Grimsby in North East Lincolnshire, halfway up England\u2019s east coast.\nIt\u2019s a quirk that sums up this football club, my football club; the League Two club who knocked Manchester United of the Premier League out of the Carabao Cup in such dizzying, dramatic fashion on Wednesday night.\nAdvertisement\nWe literally have the word \u2018grim\u2019 in our name, we wear black and white stripes (\u201cOooh it\u2019s just like watching Juventus\u201d), carry inflatable fish (that\u2019s Harry the Haddock, by the way) and sing incessantly about the industry that once made Grimsby the world\u2019s largest port (\u201cyes we do, yes we do\u201d).

It\u2019s a statement, maybe even a state of mind sometimes.\nYou could hear it from the supporters at Blundell Park when the world\u2019s most famous football team rolled into town, all smiles and anthem jackets, lolling around on the grass before kick-off. \u201cWe have smaller teams in Portugal too,\u201d said United head coach Ruben Amorim in his pre-match interview with ITV, which showed the game live on free-to-air television in the UK. Not like this, you don\u2019t.\nThe players were so close together in the tunnel that the officials had to sidestep their way between them. The Main Stand, where the dugouts are, still retains features dating back to 1901. The fans in the Pontoon, the stand behind the goal where the penalty shootout happened, can lean over the advertising hoardings and hammer on them. To say the away dressing room is compact would be an understatement.\nTown\u2019s ground, built in 1899, is squeezed in between two rows of terraced houses, with the Humber Estuary behind it. They had to close the car park on Tuesday, all 20-odd spaces of it, to accommodate the TV companies\u2019 outside-broadcast trucks.\nGrimsby Town vs Manchester United, after all, was live on both ITV and subscription-service Sky Sports in the UK. And then it rained so intensely that the television pictures were briefly interrupted, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the stadium, and the ball occasionally got stuck on the pitch, as stodgy as a tub of mushy peas. Typical.\nAdvertisement\nBut no matter. Grimsby did just what Amorim and his little tactics board couldn\u2019t and got up and at United, submitting the defence to aerial bombardment and inducing outright panic. A two-goal lead could (should?) easily have been 3-0, and they had the ball in the back of the net four times, with two goals disallowed, before the visitors woke up. Then, after United drew level in the last minute of the 90, the so-called \u2018minnows\u2019 took a breath and won 12-11 on penalties to create pure pandemonium.\nGrimsby, though, have form for bringing bigger teams crashing down to earth.\nMy dad, my sister and I went to Anfield to watch them against Liverpool in the third round of the League Cup in October 2001. Phil Jevons popped up with the most unlikely 30-yard last-gasp winner and created bedlam in the away end. Twenty years ago, it was Tottenham Hotspur who slipped up in the same competition, at Blundell Park, thanks to a last-minute goal from Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala, or JP Kalala as we called him.\nIn 2023, Grimsby reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, felling five teams from higher divisions on their way to a defeat at top-flight Brighton & Hove Albion. And on Wednesday, a squad costing less than \u00a32million, total, beat one from three tiers higher up who have spent more than \u00a3300million trying to assemble a side. If that doesn\u2019t tell you about the hope and possibilities of the English football pyramid, nothing will.\nWe have yo-yoed up and down the divisions, crashing out of the Football League in 2010, then again in 2021. But we still used to take hundreds of fans, sometimes more than 1,000, to games in the non-League fifth tier of English football. Some of them even stayed off the pitch at the final whistle.\nA new era began when local businessmen Jason Stockwood and Andrew Pettit took over in May 2021 and a proud football town got its club, its soul, back. Promotion to the Football League followed a year later. Under head coach David Artell, Grimsby are unbeaten in League Two this season after five games, having won three and drawn two.\nAdvertisement\nGrimsby is not a place without its problems, far from it.\nLast year, it was dubbed Britain\u2019s \u201cworklessness capital\u201d after a documentary cited the high number of people claiming benefits. The less said about the 2016 Sacha Baron Cohen film titled Grimsby, the better.\nThe thing about Grimsby is you never pass through it. Geographically, it\u2019s stuck out on its own. You have to drive down England\u2019s most boring motorway, the M180, then suffer the grating concrete hell of the A180, or weave your way across the flat fields of Lincolnshire, or catch a train from Doncaster \u2014 like lots of Yorkshire folk have done over the years on a sunny day \u2014 to get there.\nBut it\u2019s our place and Grimsby Town is our football club (even if, like me, you\u2019re from the other side of the Humber \u2014 it\u2019s a long story). There\u2019s such pride in those distinctive black and white stripes, and no small amount of defiance either. We\u2019re the Mariners, and \u201cWe only sing when we\u2019re fishing\u201d.\nIf you drive down Cleethorpes seafront, past the chip shops and the slot-machine arcades, the boating lake and the world\u2019s smallest pub, turn left and then left again, you come to the Greenwich Meridian line. This is the point where east meets west; zero longitude. It\u2019s 2,517 miles to the North Pole and 9,919 miles to the South Pole, according to the sign.\nThere is a statue of a globe there too, with an inscription which says: \u201cThe World revolves around Cleethorpes.\u201d\nWell, the football world did on Wednesday night. And it was utterly marvellous.\n(Top photo: Nigel French/PA Images via Getty Images)"

The defeat, coupled with early league setbacks, has intensified pressure on the manager and raised doubts about the club\u2019s long\u2011term trajectory. Amid the turmoil, United secured new attacking signings\u2014Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko\u2014to bolster a squad that has struggled to find consistency. The loss also highlighted the contrast between United\u2019s high\u2011profile transfer activity and the underperformance of its current squad, prompting calls for deeper structural changes.",
