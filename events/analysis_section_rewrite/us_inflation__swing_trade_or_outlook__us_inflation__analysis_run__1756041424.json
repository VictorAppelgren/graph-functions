      "feedback": "The draft largely hinges on the right regime framework but fails several formatting and evidentiary constraints needed for world-class quality. Key fixes: (1) restrict Movers & Scenarios to exactly four lines—two Up and two Down—and move the Swing Trade into a separate Trade/Outlook Plan section; current content includes five Movers lines plus the Swing Trade, which violates the constraint and muddies the signal. (2) Reformat each Movers line strictly as: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. Remove extraneous prose and ensure each line’s driver is a single, crisp mechanism linked to the regime anchors (demographics/LTC costs, inflation, cloud/AI moats, tariff pass-through). (3) Anchor every probability to explicit evidence and cite only the IDs that support it; avoid flat 40/55% without provenance—e.g., tie a probability to a concrete data point (Azure 39% YoY growth, $368B contracted revenue; tariff pass-through estimates like ~$3,800 per household; etc.) and place the (ID) citations next to those facts. (4) Ensure citations cover all critical sources and reconcile conflicts—if Burry’s positions are mentioned, frame them as ancillary sentiment signals rather than drivers, and reconcile with the base-case cash-flow durability and moats. (5) Ensure a clean, concise base-case with explicit catalysts and a concrete invalidation event; describe four triggers (tariff pass-through trajectory, inflation prints, AI/moot durability, policy/credit cycles) and specify what would invalidate the base-case. (6) The Swing Trade/Outlook Plan should be separate, 1–2 lines (tradable asset) or a single Outlook line (non-tradable), with fields filled: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability | Confidence. Provide a precise entry level, stop, and target that yield a defensible R/R (e.g., 3.0x) and document a clear invalidation and trigger. (7) Tighten the “What to watch” items to discrete data points (Azure/Shopify momentum; tariff updates; private-market liquidity signals; AI-productivity milestones; debt trajectories) with the relevant IDs after each data point. (8) Align time horizons across lines (avoid mixing 0–3 weeks with 2–4 months in the same Movers block unless clearly justified) to enhance readability and scenario coherence. (9) Where numbers appear, prefer ranges or explicit point estimates drawn from the material, and label ranges (e.g., 35–40%, 40–55%) rather than single, potentially misleading points. (10) After redraft, run a quick consistency check: do all four lines map cleanly to the four regime anchors in the source map (aging/LTC costs; inflation; moats from software/cloud/healthcare; tariff/policy pass-through), and are all critical sources represented where facts are asserted?\n\nIn short, deliver four tight Movers lines with exact fields, two Up and two Down, each with a grounded probability and a concise citation, move the Swing Trade into a separate Outlook/Trade Plan section with full entry/stop/target/R-R/invalidation details, and prune extraneous elements to achieve a first-principles, scenario-driven, highly quant-based, and fully cited world-class Swing Trade outline.",
