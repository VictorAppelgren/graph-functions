      "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Hits Homerun Again, Buys Alphabet Stock 5 Days Before Favorable Antitrust Ruling: Here Are Some Other New Trades - Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC), FedEx (NYSE:FDX)",
      "summary": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene purchased Alphabet Inc. Class C shares on August 28, 2025, just five days before a U.S. District Judge ruled against a DOJ antitrust breakup, sending Alphabet’s Class C stock up 6.73% in after‑hours trading. The trade was part of a larger buying spree that included FedEx and other holdings, with Greene’s overall portfolio underperforming the S&P 500 over the past year. While her individual Alphabet trade was well‑timed, her broader trading activity has lagged market returns, though a few positions (e.g., Impinj, Goldman Sachs) yielded high gains.",
