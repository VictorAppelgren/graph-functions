  "description": "National Park Service reopened an 8-mile section of Blue Ridge Parkway in NC from Mileposts 221.8-229.7 near Virginia Aug. 15 after Helene landslide.",
  "content": "The National Park Service reopened an 8-mile section of the Blue Ridge Parkway from Milepost 221.8 to 229.7 on the North Carolina side near the border with Virginia on Aug. 15, the agency said in a news release issued the same day.\n\nThe reopening represents the completion of both a long-planned bridge maintenance project and a Tropical Storm Helene recovery project due to a landslide at Milepost 224.9, the Park Service said. It also restores continuous access to more than 20 miles of the parkway from the Virginia state line to North Carolina\u2019s Doughton Park, including access to Doughton Park campground and The Bluffs restaurant.\n\nThe Aug. 15 opening is another in an initial round of recovery projects underway along the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina, which sustained severe damage from landslides triggered by the September 2024 storm. When the first round of projects is complete, during the fall of 2025, more than 50 miles of the parkway will be restored for public use in various locations across Western North Carolina, the Park Service said.\n\nOfficials are prioritizing restoring road access through a phased system to provide both public access to newly opened areas as soon as possible, and access to previously unreachable areas by contractors, according to the Park Service.\n\nThe agency described the construction as \u201ccomplex and highly technical, including factors such as remoteness, challenging terrain, and reduced construction seasons due to ice and winter weather at higher elevations.\u201d\n\nThe parkway \u2014 the most-visited unit of the National Park Service with 16.7 million visitors in 2024 \u2014 is closed for some 68 miles, much of it in the popular areas just north of Asheville at MP 377/Craven Gap to MP 316.5 near Linville Falls, which is also closed.\n\nFor safety, the park is also asking that people remain patient and respect remaining closures.\n\n\u201cMultiple seen and unseen hazards exist in closed areas, and crews and heavy equipment at work make areas unsafe,\u201d the Aug. 15 release states. \u201cVisitors should also be aware that trail assessments are also still underway, and caution should be exercised as hikers may encounter hazards on trails such as landslides, tree debris and washed-out sections or bridges.\u201d\n\nThe park encourages visitors to plan carefully for any trip along the Blue Ridge Parkway and consult the park\u2019s website for planning tools. The park\u2019s website provides extensive information, including current road status, multiple regional maps, and other helpful information, about the park\u2019s recovery process at go.nps.gov/Helene.\n\nMore: Blue Ridge Parkway section opens north of Asheville: What to know about Helene repairs\n\nMore: Blue Ridge Parkway: Which Helene-damaged areas might reopen in late summer, early fall?\n\nJacob Biba is the Helene recovery reporter at the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "|\nIn September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Florida and then stormed across multiples states in the Southeast. Along the Blue Ridge Parkway, the storm devastated the park and local areas with up to 30 inches of rain in localized areas and peak sustained winds of up to 60 miles per hour. The heavy rain and wind resulted in significant damage along the Parkway, including thousands of downed trees and debris covering the motor road, damage to facilities and multiple landslides that resulted in weakened structural integrity and loss of road segments.

      "text": "|\nSince Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc across southern Appalachia in late September of 2024, the National Park Service (NPS) has cleared mountains of debris, conducted hundreds of facility and resource assessments, and reopened over 310 miles of the 469-mile Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia and North Carolina. In both states, widespread treefall, erosion, trail, and culvert damage occurred and many structures, both historic and non-historic, were heavily damaged. Critical drainage features that support public infrastructure were also compromised and many significant cultural and natural landscapes were impacted. The work to restore the Parkway is complex and some areas will take years to repair and fully reopen. Scope of DamageSome of the most significant damage to the Parkway\u2019s primary roadway occurred in North Carolina. The NPS has identified landslides across approximately 200 miles of Parkway in North Carolina, stretching from the Virginia-North Carolina boundary to beyond Mount Pisgah, south of Asheville. The landslides range in scale and scope, as some slides occurred above the parkway, some below, some taking out portions of the road, and some less obvious, but compromising the integrity of the road or drainage systems. The highest concentration of overall damage occurred from the Linville Falls area near milepost 317 south to Mount Mitchell State Park near milepost 349. Along with the destruction of park facilities near Linville Falls, including the visitor center, picnic area comfort station, and portions of the campground, park teams have documented over four dozen landslides and other storm-related natural and cultural resource damage in those 38 miles of Parkway alone. While the road is open in all 217 miles of the Parkway in Virginia, additional repair and clean up work remains. In the coming months recovery work in Virginia will focus on roadway and drainage repairs, hazard tree work, woody debris removal, culvert cleaning, removing siltation from mill ponds, repairing damage to historic and non-historic structures, trail clearing, and cultural landscape and natural resource restoration. FundingFunding for storm recovery will be available from multiple sources, including a portion of the more than $2 billion in supplemental disaster funding Congress recently allocated to the NPS. The park has already benefited in $25 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) emergency relief funds. The NPS is working closely with FHWA to perform emergency stabilization and repair work at several slide locations near critical transportation networks, and to complete debris removal and roadway guardrail repairs. Contracts have been awarded for a portion of this work, with an initial round of emergency repairs expected to begin in the coming weeks and continue across the summer. A Phased Approach (updated, June 2025)As a result of Hurricane Helene, the Parkway identified at least 57 landslides of varying complexity across nearly 200 miles in North Carolina. Work to restore road access, repair road damage, and stabilize slide areas began in the fall of 2024, and is planned in three phases, as outlined:\nThis phased system provides both public access to newly opened areas as soon as possible, and access to previously unreachable areas by contractors. Parkway construction activity is complex and highly technical, including factors such as remoteness, challenging terrain, and reduced construction seasons due to ice and winter weather at higher elevations. The Process - Reinforced Soil SlopeThe Parkway is using a process called Reinforced Soil Slope (RSS) to construct a more stable landscape in the at least 57 areas impacted by landslides as a result of Helene.\nRecreating Responsibly\n|\nLast updated: July 24, 2025"

  "argos_summary": "The National Park Service reopened an 8\u2011mile stretch of the Blue Ridge Parkway (Mileposts 221.8\u2013229.7) on August\u202f15 after completing a bridge maintenance project and clearing a landslide caused by Tropical Storm Helene at Milepost\u202f224.9.  The opening restores continuous access to more than 20 miles of the parkway, including Doughton Park and The Bluffs restaurant, and is part of the first phase of recovery work that will reopen over 50 miles by fall\u202f2025.  While many sections remain closed\u2014especially around Asheville\u2014visitors are urged to check the NPS website for current road status, safety warnings, and planning tools.  The parkway, the NPS\u2019s most\u2011visited unit, remains closed for about 68 miles due to landslides, debris, and ongoing repairs.",
