  "description": "National Bank of Canada\u2019s earnings came up just short of estimates as its capital-markets business failed to match analysts\u2019 forecasts for a unit that\u2019s benefited f\u2026",
  "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 National Bank of Canada\u2019s earnings came up just short of estimates as its capital-markets business failed to match analysts\u2019 forecasts for a unit that\u2019s benefited from market volatility around this year\u2019s tariff chaos. The company\u2019s shares slipped.\n\nThe Montreal-based lender earned C$2.68 a share on an adjusted basis in its fiscal third quarter, according to a statement Wednesday, missing the C$2.70 average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Net income at the firm\u2019s financial-markets unit totaled C$334 million ($241 million) for the three months through July, less than the C$365 million average forecast of four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.\n\nThat comes after National Bank posted record results in its capital-markets division in the second quarter on supercharged trading revenue thanks to market swings in the wake of US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcements in early April.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nStill, the company is \u201cvery happy with our results,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Laurent Ferreira said, noting that profit was up from a year earlier in the capital-markets business. April had been a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of high volatility and extremely elevated trading activity, which works in the bank\u2019s favor from a structural perspective, he said, but that subsided in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always communicated this to investors: when there are times of heightened volatility, we should do better,\u201d Ferreira said in an interview. \u201cAnd when there\u2019s less volume, our trading activity is lower.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far, it\u2019s been a really good journey,\u201d Ferreira said, adding that the company began bringing employees on board in the spring and did its first integration of retail and commercial clients two weeks ago, including converting one of the CWB branches to the National Bank banner. He expects to finish switching over customers to the National Bank platform by the end of the year.",

  "summary": "National Bank of Canada's Q3 earnings fell short of estimates, largely due to its capital-markets business, which has benefited from market volatility during this year's tariff chaos. The company earned C$2.68 per share on an adjusted basis, which fell short against the average of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Net income at the financial-markets unit totaled C$334 million ($241 million) for the three months through July, less than the C$365 million average forecast of four analysts.
