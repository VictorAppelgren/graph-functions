  "content": "Shares of online advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) jumped 8.3% in the morning session after a U.S. judge's ruling in a major antitrust case eased fears of a forced break-up of the company.\n\nThe decision allows Google to retain control of its key businesses, including the Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system, which the U.S. Department of Justice had sought to divest.\n\nInvestors welcomed the news, seeing it as a \"massive win\" that helps the tech giant avoid the worst-case scenario. While the company was spared a structural break-up, the judge did bar Google from entering into certain exclusive search agreements in the future and will require modest data sharing with competitors. The ruling removes a significant regulatory overhang for the company.\n\nFollowing the news, analysts at Needham reiterated a 'Buy' rating and raised their price target from $220 to $260, signaling renewed confidence.\n\nIs now the time to buy Alphabet? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nAlphabet\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was about 22 hours ago when the stock dropped 2.1% on the news that the stock was caught in a broader tech-sector downturn fueled by renewed uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs.\n\nThe sell-off in tech stocks followed an appeals court ruling that recently imposed U.S. \"reciprocal\" tariffs are illegal, sparking fresh concerns about trade policy. The news pressured many of the world's largest technology companies, with Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft also seeing declines in trading. Alphabet's drop also comes after a strong five-month winning streak that pushed the stock into what some analysts consider \"overbought territory.\" The stock's daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, had approached 75, a level that can signal a potential pullback or correction is imminent.\n\nAlphabet is up 20.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $228.95 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Alphabet\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,810.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

      "text": "High-Quality Businesses Win\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is an exciting stock because it offers exposure to the multi-decade mega-trend of automation. On top of that, its role in automating IT Service management puts it in a prime position to benefit from the introduction of generative AI.\nWe are long-term investors, not speculators, so we don\u2019t celebrate the short-term wins. Nonetheless, we are grateful and fortunate that Lead Analyst Anthony Lee chose a good time (August 17, 2023) to issue our ServiceNow buy recommendation exclusively to paying members of StockStory Edge. The stock was roughly $540 a share then.\nDespite the 85+% share price increase since then, we still have ServiceNow in our portfolio. Note that we (the StockStory team) only bought shares in ServiceNow days after recommending it to members of StockStory Edge. And if in the future we no longer consider ServiceNow compelling, StockStory Edge members will be the first to know. We never trade personally until after informing our members and giving them 5 trading days to act.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nServiceNow (NOW): StockStory Edge Stock Of The Month For August 2023\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has been a stock market winner ever since its summer 2012 IPO. It priced at $18, closed its first day of trading at $24.60, and hasn\u2019t looked back. The shares now trade at around $1,000. Since its IPO, this is not just one of the best-performing stocks in enterprise software but in the whole market.\nJust because the stock is up big, however, doesn\u2019t mean the opportunity is gone.\nIn this case? Quite the opposite.\nThat\u2019s because ServiceNow offers sticky mission-critical products across IT, HR, and customer service that reduce manual work, eliminate human error, and keep large corporations functioning. The company generates reliable subscription revenue from its happy customers and because of attractive unit economics, that revenue turns into high profits and free cash margins. The excess cash churned out by the business can be used to continually widen ServiceNow's lead over the competition competition from a brand, product, and customer service standpoint.\nThe kicker is that ServiceNow is now very much a Generative AI beneficiary due to its partnership with NVIDIA.\nWhat Does ServiceNow Do?\nServiceNow\u2019s software platform helps businesses automate workflows and gives them a birds-eye view of their operations, unifying what has become an increasingly complex technology stack for many companies.\nServiceNow was founded in 2003 when current Chairman of the Board Fred Luddy recognized the inefficiencies of traditional IT Service Management (ITSM) at a time when employees might have to jump through multiple hoops to request help and then sit on standby for hours until someone from the IT department fixed their problem.\nLuddy envisioned a world where technology could speed up these slow, cumbersome processes and launched the company\u2019s first product in 2006.\nToday, corporations of all sizes rely on ServiceNow to not only streamline IT but also manage their entire organization through a simple yet comprehensive online portal. For example, onboarding a new employee involves HR for payroll, IT for device needs, and whatever is specific to that person\u2019s department.\nServiceNow brings these disparate systems together and automates the onboarding process, which will inevitably happen over and over again.\nServiceNow\u2019s all-in-one platform gives customers numerous products to choose from, as shown in the graphic below. These software programs allow administrators to execute repetitive, labor-intensive tasks with the click of a button. On top of that, each product is wrapped in analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities, allowing customers to extract powerful insights from their data.\nThe company\u2019s ambition doesn\u2019t end there. ServiceNow has a strong track record of releasing new products to boost its customers\u2019 productivity, the latest being a low-code platform that enables non-technical employees to build custom software applications. ServiceNow constantly surprises its customers (and investors) with innovation, granting it huge upside potential.\nWhy We Love An Investment In ServiceNow\nFor starters, we love the software subscription business model. If you sell sneakers, for instance, customers who bought from you last quarter may not come back again this quarter. On the other hand, software customers often sign multi-year contracts, resulting in recurring, predictable revenues and lower customer acquisition costs.\nWithin software, we believe ServiceNow has a very strong brand. \u201cNobody ever got fired for buying IBM\u201d was a common phrase in IT circles in the 1980s and early 1990s, and we argue that NOW is heading in the same direction. 85% of Fortune 500 companies are ServiceNow customers and those controlling IT budgets view the company as trustworthy, reliable, and safe because of how many happy, loyal, and influential customers it has.\nFurthermore, ServiceNow\u2019s customers rarely cancel their subscriptions because its products are deeply intertwined with company operations. ServiceNow is capable of replacing a multitude of legacy software systems\u2013everything from technical support to managing downtime. That means switching to ServiceNow can make life easier for employees, and once it\u2019s there, switching away is very disruptive. This results in a sky-high renewal rate of around 98%.\nTurning to profit, ServiceNow stands out with its gross margin of around 85% on its subscription revenue. From there, its adjusted operating margin and free cash flow margin will both hover around 30% when 2024 is all said and done. This makes ServiceNow a money-printing machine with the capital to grow its competitive position by improving existing products, adding new products, and promoting its brand.\nWhat Does ServiceNow\u2019s Future Hold?\nWe think much of ServiceNow\u2019s future growth will stem from selling more products to existing customers. The chart below shows how its \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy has developed over time. ServiceNow has successfully upsold its customers as 82% of contracts in 2023 featured five or more products purchased, up from 54% in 2019 (note that NNACV is 'net new annual contract value', a proxy for incremental revenue). We expect this number to be around 85% when the company reports 2024 results.\nAnother underappreciated growth lever is ServiceNow\u2019s pricing power. Before 2018, the company had one pricing tier for all products. That changed in 2018 when NOW introduced a \u2018Pro\u2019 tier for IT service management, whereby customers could upgrade their packages to get more analytical and AI functionality. What\u2019s next? Pro Plus, of course. It boasts \u201cgreater AI capabilities\u201d, and we expect it to contribute to future growth.\nWe think as more of ServiceNow\u2019s growth comes from existing customers, marketing expenses will moderate as a percentage of revenue, and thus we believe ServiceNow can earn higher profit margins as it grows.\nWhy Is Now The Right Time to Buy?\nServiceNow\u2019s price-to-forward-sales (next 12 months) multiple is currently over 15x, higher than most companies and higher than when we recommended it back in August 2023.\nNonetheless, we think ServiceNow can justify its valuation due to its long-term demand tailwinds, predictable subscription model, best-in-class customer retention, and robust profit margins. We'd also add that our extensive backtest research and analysis has shown that when it comes to outperforming the market, business quality matters much more than entry price--you get what you pay for. Said differently, valuation may seem daunting in the near term, but companies showing robust growth up and down the P&L \"grow into\" their premium multiples over time.\nThe cherry on top is that the company is increasingly showing that it will be a Generative AI beneficiary for years--even decades--to come. In May 2023, ServiceNow and NVIDIA announced a partnership. The principal goal for ServiceNow was to develop custom large language models (LLMs) using NVIDIA\u2019s technology.\nThe result includes intelligent virtual assistants and AI chatbots that can better resolve user issues and support requests. The secret sauce involves two parts: the GenAI\u2019s capability to pull knowledge from unstructured data such as source code, internal documents, or videos to answer questions combined with the LLMs\u2019 ability to summarize the information, eliminate the technical jargon, and give conversational responses.\nIn February 2024, ServiceNow unveiled an industry-specific solution for the telecom sector. \u2018Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management\u2019 is for an industry where consumers are particularly frustrated with their customer service interactions (have you ever called customer service about your smartphone bill or tried to change plans??). Surely, similar solutions for other consumer-facing industries will roll out soon.\nWe really like that these GenAI and LLM-driven offerings are easy for customers to understand and provide straightforward, quantifiable benefits (the cost of a customer service agent). Combined with ServiceNow\u2019s large customer base that already trusts the company in IT, Customer Service, and Human Resources, we think the company can start reaping the needle-moving benefits of GenAI in the near term.\nWith its product portfolio that is mission-critical for most customers, the expansion of this portfolio, and the GenAI tailwind, we think ServiceNow's revenue can sustain 20+% growth for a number of years.\nWith efficiency on expenses, especially the sales and marketing leverage, that revenue growth can translate into roughly 35% adjusted operating profit growth over time. It's had a big run in a short period and could take a breather in the near term, but we\u2019re convinced the stock could approach $1,550 by the end of 2027. If that occurs, it would still generate a return that likely beats the market despite the big jump in the share price since we first pitched the stock.\nLooking beyond 2026, we love a number of things about ServiceNow: the secular tailwinds it enjoys, the company's continually strengthening brand, and its products that bring customers great value and efficiency. This combination will drive stronger-for-longer revenue growth than the market anticipates.\nThis is a stock for investors looking for a high-quality business to hold over the long term.\nWhat Are The Key Risks And How Do We Feel About Them?\nThose stocks that are \u2018\u201csure things\u201d? They don\u2019t exist. Every investment has its risks.\nFor ServiceNow, we\u2019ve boiled them down into the three most important: competition, margins, and valuation.\nServiceNow has a tight grip on the IT service management market, but future returns will need to come from selling adjacent products where it faces stiffer competition. This means squaring off against Salesforce in customer service management, Microsoft in low-code/AI applications, and younger upstarts like Rippling in HR solutions. More competition means that ServiceNow may have to spend more on product development or accept lower gross margins to maintain its growth rate.\nThat leads us to our next risk\u2013margins. Our thesis holds that ServiceNow can reduce its expenses as a percentage of revenue as it grows. There\u2019s a chance this doesn\u2019t happen. For example, new products may gain less traction than expected or cost more than anticipated to develop.\nTurning to valuation, ServiceNow isn\u2019t conventionally cheap based on current earnings. It has a lofty P/E ratio, implying the market expects many years of growth ahead. That makes it vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and sentiment around high-growth businesses.\nUltimately, we\u2019re comfortable with these risks because of ServiceNow\u2019s dominance, reputation, products, financial strength. We expect many years of healthy growth in revenue, profits, and free cash flow.\nClosing Thoughts\nWe\u2019re excited about ServiceNow at this stage in its evolution. Software is still eating the world, and within software, ServiceNow is an elite asset in terms of its products and financials. Please note that members of StockStory hold shares in ServiceNow.

      "text": "Alphabet (GOOGL)\nWe see solid potential in Alphabet. Its fast revenue growth, profitability, and exceptional prospects make it a spectacular asset.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Like Alphabet\nStarted by Stanford students Larry Page and Sergey Brin in a Menlo Park garage, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the parent company of the eponymous Google Search engine, Google Cloud Platform, and YouTube.\n- Alphabet\u2019s dominant Google Search sits on the pantheon of the best businesses ever. This is reflected in its robust long-term revenue growth and elite operating margin.\n- The company\u2019s profit margins have become even higher over time, speaking to its scale advantages and operating efficiency not only in its core Search business but also in Google Cloud Platform and YouTube.\n- Revenue growth and increasing operating margins are the key ingredients for strong EPS growth. Google has these, and when also factoring in its share repurchases, you can see why EPS has exploded over the long term.\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Alphabet?\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Alphabet?\nAlphabet is trading at $226.30 per share, or 22x forward price-to-earnings. Valuation is lower than most companies in the consumer internet space, and we believe Alphabet is attractively-priced for its quality.\nWhere you buy a stock impacts returns. Our analysis shows that business quality is a much bigger determinant of market outperformance over the long term compared to entry price, but getting a good deal on a stock certainly isn\u2019t a bad thing.\n3. Alphabet (GOOGL) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nOnline advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported Q2 CY2025 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 13.8% year on year to $96.43 billion. Its GAAP profit of $2.31 per share was 5.7% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $96.43 billion vs analyst estimates of $93.98 billion (2.6% beat)\n- Operating Profit (GAAP): $31.27 billion vs analyst estimates of $31.09 billion (0.6% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $2.31 vs analyst estimates of $2.19 (5.7% beat)\n- Google Search Revenue: $0.02 vs analyst estimates of $52.92 billion (2.4% beat)\n- Google Cloud Revenue: $0.04 vs analyst estimates of $13.12 billion (3.8% beat)\n- YouTube Revenue: $9.80 billion vs analyst estimates of $9.58 billion (2.3% beat)\n- Google Services Operating Profit: $0.01 vs analyst estimates of $32.77 billion (small beat)\n- Google Cloud Operating Profit: $0.26 vs analyst estimates of $2.24 billion (26.2% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 32.4%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- \"With this strong and growing demand for our Cloud products and services, we are increasing our investment in capital expenditures in 2025 to approximately $85 billion and are excited by the opportunity ahead\" - CEO\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 5.5%, down from 15.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $2.33 trillion\nKey Topics & Areas Of Debate\nAI is likely the hottest topic in the world of investing today. Regarding Alphabet, the debate is about how AI\u2019s advancement will impact the company\u2019s bread-and-butter Search business. It is a business where Alphabet has dominant market share, and it is also highly profitable.\nWill the development of AI hurt Alphabet because OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and even Microsoft\u2019s Bing will take market share from Google, once thought to be nearly invincible in the online search market? Or will Alphabet\u2019s Gemini product, first announced in December 2023, allow the company to dominate the Search market for years or even decades to come given its brand recognition?\nAs background, Gemini is designed to advance natural language understanding and meet certain thresholds in conversational and contextual understanding. In short, it is meant to provide even more accurate and personalized results, which would be a replay of what made Google so successful decades ago.\nDespite its scale and dominance, Alphabet doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum. ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) new and improved Bing engine are current competitors to Google Search while Meta (NASDAQ:META) is extending beyond social media and into the online search market with its AI-powered assistant.\nAlphabet runs into Microsoft often, as it is also one of its primary adversaries in the public cloud services market along with Amazon\u2019s formidable AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN). Finally, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and many other video streaming platforms go head-to-head against the company\u2019s YouTube segment.\n4. Company Overview\nStarted by Stanford students Larry Page and Sergey Brin in a Menlo Park garage, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the parent company of the eponymous Google Search engine, Google Cloud Platform, and YouTube.\nThe Google Search engine \u2013 Alphabet\u2019s initial product \u2013 is used for 80%+ of internet searches, and the scale of data it generates makes the company the largest recipient of online advertising dollars globally. Google Search\u2019s ad tools and ad units are some of the most effective in the market as search queries remove the guesswork for advertisers by directly showing intent, making it one of the most effective forms of online advertising.\nAlong with Google Search, Alphabet's video-sharing site YouTube has over 2.5 billion monthly users and it has an additional 1 billion+ users across its Gmail, Chrome web browser, and Google Maps products. Lastly, its mobile operating system, Android, is a big competitor to Apple's iOS operating system and is used by almost half of the Earth\u2019s population.\nOn the business services side, the company operates the fast-growing Google Cloud Platform (GCP), a large cloud computing service that competes with Amazon's AWS and Microsoft Azure in cloud-based storage, computing, and database management. Rounding out Alphabet is a variety of other bets, which include autonomous driving company Waymo and life sciences research company Verily.\nAlphabet's artificial intelligence and machine learning tools are considered amongst the most sophisticated in the world, and the question is if it can leverage these advantages to take more share in search and cloud computing while maybe even creating the next new technology.\n5. Revenue Growth\nAlphabet proves that huge, scaled companies can still grow quickly. The company\u2019s revenue base of $166 billion five years ago has more than doubled to $371.4 billion in the last year, translating into an incredible 17.5% annualized growth rate.\nAlphabet\u2019s growth over the same period was also higher than its big tech peers, Amazon (16.6%), Microsoft (14.4%), and Apple (8%). Comparing the four is relevant because investors often pit them against each other to derive their valuations. With these benchmarks in mind, we think Alphabet is cheap.\nWe at StockStory emphasize long-term growth, but for big tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss emerging trends in AI. Alphabet\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 13.3% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nThis quarter, Alphabet reported year-on-year revenue growth of 13.8%, and its $96.43 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.6%. Looking ahead, sell-side This projection is still healthy and illustrates the market sees some success for its newer products.\n6. Google Search: Alphabet\u2019s Bread-and-Butter\nThe most topical question surrounding Alphabet today is: \u201cWill new Generative-AI products like ChatGPT and Meta AI disrupt Google Search and its 80%+ market share?\u201d.\nAlthough OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) doesn\u2019t disclose its financials, we can gain further insight by comparing Google Search to Meta and Microsoft\u2019s Bing. Meta essentially has a monopoly in social media advertising and is creeping into search with Meta AI, which is powered by its Llama large language model, while Bing is the distant number two search engine that benefits from its integration with ChatGPT.\nStarting with Alphabet, Google Search is by far the most considerable portion of its revenue at 56.1%, and it grew at a 16.3% annualized rate over the last five years, slower than total revenue. The previous two years also saw deceleration as it grew by 12.3% annually, though this isn\u2019t concerning since it\u2019s still expanding quickly.\nOn the other hand, its two-year result was lower than Meta\u2019s 21.8%, showing digital advertising dollars could be flowing to Meta because of its improved AI algorithms and targeting capabilities. Alphabet bulls would argue this trend could reverse because the return on investment from keyword-driven advertising is more tangible, but that hasn\u2019t been the case lately.\nQuarterly performance is particularly relevant for Alphabet because it captures the growth of AI and signals whether investors are overestimating its competitive impact. Bulls can rejoice as Google Search revenue exceeded expectations in Q2, outperforming Wall Street Consensus by 2.4%. The segment recorded a hearty year-on-year increase of 11.7%.\nWhile this was slower than Bing\u2019s 23%, it\u2019s important to consider that Bing has a much smaller revenue base and doesn\u2019t pose a significant threat yet. Still, Alphabet must continue topping Wall Street\u2019s Google Search projections and performing well in other segments like Google Cloud Platform and YouTube to win the debate.\n7. Google Cloud Platform: The Fast-Growing Horse\nAlmost all modern internet applications are built on public cloud infrastructure. AWS is a massive success for Amazon, and it is no surprise that Alphabet wants a slice of the pie. But can it catch up?\nRevenue in Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud Platform (GCP) grew at a spectacular pace over the last five years, clocking in at 35.5% annualized. On a two-year basis, growth was 28.8%. This was slower than its five-year rate, but it\u2019s impressive nonetheless.\nSince 2020, GCP has expanded from 6.5% of consolidated revenue to 13.2% today, and the segment\u2019s size should increase over time as its growth is expected to outpace Search and the overall business.\nHowever, when comparing GCP to its \"hyperscaler\" peers, we can see it\u2019s far behind in third - its run-rate revenue (current quarter\u2019s sales times four) is around $55 billion while AWS and Azure (a subset of Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment) are on track for roughly $100 billion and $75 billion billion, respectively. GCP\u2019s smaller revenue base makes it easier to grow, but the looming question is if it can catch up in scale and exhibit the same profit margins.\nThis quarter, GCP revenue grew by 31.7%, beating expectations by 3.7%. Its growth was faster than AWS\u2019s 16.9% but slower than Azure\u2019s 33%. Given the scale differences, GCP must consistently outgrow its rivals for an extended period to have any chance of besting the competition.\n8. YouTube: Netflix\u2019s Rival\nOnline video streaming platforms make money through subscription fees, advertising, or some combination of both. Advertising is the bigger chunk of sales for YouTube, and like GCP, it is a smaller segment for Alphabet at 10.3% of revenue. Still, YouTube is a focus for investors given its large addressable market and 2.5 billion+ monthly active users.\nOver the last five years, YouTube\u2019s strong 18.4% annualized revenue growth was in line with the broader company\u2019s performance. In recent years, however, the segment decelerated, as seen by its 13.9% two-year annual growth. This is still healthy, and some level of deceleration is expected with a large revenue base.\nA comforting data point is that its growth was similar to Netflix\u2019s 13.9% annualized rate over the last two years, though comparisons aren\u2019t exactly apples-to-apples because Netflix mainly generates revenue through subscriptions (you can see this in YouTube\u2019s choppier advertising revenue in the chart below). We\u2019ll continue monitoring the situation closely as Netflix\u2019s new ad-supported tier could increase competition for online video ad dollars.\nIn Q2, YouTube\u2019s $9.80 billion of revenue beat expectations by 2.2% and grew by 13.1% year on year. The quarterly print isn\u2019t too different than its two-year result, suggesting it\u2019s staying the course.\n9. Gross Margin\nAlphabet\u2019s biggest source of revenue, advertising from Google Search, is also quite profitable. Its gross margin routinely punches in above 75% because its cost of goods sold is low - they mostly consist of traffic acquisition costs, or payments made to browsers and mobile carriers for directing web traffic to google.com.\nThe company\u2019s other businesses like GCP and YouTube, with their data center and content costs, have lower gross margins than Search, so they drag overall unit economics down. Still, Alphabet\u2019s consolidated gross margin is rock-solid as it averaged 57% over the last five years. This serves as a nice starting point for ultimate operating profitability and free cash flow.\nAlphabet\u2019s gross margin was 59.5% in Q2, up from 58.1% in the same quarter last year. That means for every $100 in revenue, $59.51 was left to invest in sales, marketing, R&D, and general administrative overhead.\n10. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is the key profitability measure for Alphabet. It\u2019s the portion of revenue left after accounting for all operating expenses \u2013 everything from the IT infrastructure powering online searches to product development and administrative expenses.\nAlphabet has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a consumer internet business, boasting an average operating of 29.5%. A closer examination is required, however, because the company\u2019s individual business lines have very different margin profiles.\nThe Google Services segment, which includes Search, YouTube, the Pixel smartphone, and other advertising revenues, boasted an average operating margin of 36.9% over the last five years (Search and YouTube standalone profitability is not disclosed).\nGoogle Cloud was also profitable, recording an average operating margin of 3.5% at the same time. The cherry on top was this quarter\u2019s margin of 20.7%, which shows the business is gaining operating leverage. Still, GCP\u2019s most recent margin is well below AWS\u2019s 39.5% quarterly print. GCP has a long way to catch up on both scale and margins, which isn\u2019t surprising since the second dynamic very much depends on the first.\nPutting it all together, Alphabet\u2019s operating rose by 4.2 percentage points over the last five years. This expansion was driven by operating leverage across its businesses, and if Alphabet can avoid overhiring, company-level margins could tick even higher.\nThis quarter, Alphabet generated an operating profit margin of 32.4%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\nIn the coming year, Wall Street expects Alphabet to maintain its trailing 12-month operating of 32.7%.\n11. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) alongside revenue and margins because it shows whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable and what else affects shareholder returns.\nAlphabet\u2019s EPS grew at an astounding 32.7% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 17.5% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nDiving into the nuances of Alphabet\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Alphabet\u2019s operating was flat this quarter but expanded by 4.2 percentage points over the last five years. On top of that, its share count shrank by 11.2%. These are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\nFor Alphabet, its two-year annual EPS growth of 40.8% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base.\nIn Q2, Alphabet reported EPS at $2.31, up from $1.89 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 5.7%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Alphabet\u2019s full-year EPS of $9.39 to grow 2.2%.\n12. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills or invest for the future.\nAlphabet has shown robust cash profitability, driven by its attractive business model that enables it to reinvest or return capital to investors while maintaining a cash cushion. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 21.7% over the last five years, quite impressive for a consumer internet business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Alphabet\u2019s margin dropped by 8.6 percentage points over the last five years. Continued declines could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle as it competes for the best AI chips to power its products.\nAlphabet\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $5.30 billion in Q2, equivalent to a 5.5% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 10.4 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, which isn\u2019t ideal considering its longer-term trend.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Alphabet\u2019s cash conversion will slightly improve. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 18% for the last 12 months will increase to 19.7%, giving it options for capital deployment (investments, share buybacks, dividends).\n13. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlphabet\u2019s five-year average ROIC was 42.6%, placing it among the best consumer internet companies. This illustrates its management team\u2019s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Alphabet\u2019s ROIC has decreased over the last few years. This is because it\u2019s investing aggressively to capture the AI opportunity. Only time will tell if these investments bear fruit in higher long-term ROICs.\n14. Balance Sheet Assessment\nBig corporations like Alphabet are attractive to many investors in times of instability thanks to their fortress balance sheets that buffer pockets of soft demand.\nAlphabet has an eye-popping $95.15 billion of cash on its balance sheet (that\u2019s no typo) compared to $23.61 billion of debt. This $71.54 billion net cash position is 3.1% of its market cap and shockingly larger than the value of most public companies, giving it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n15. Key Takeaways from Alphabet\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was encouraging to see Alphabet narrowly top analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter, as Google Cloud Platform, Google Search, and YouTube all beat. We were also glad its operating profit in the Services and Cloud segments outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, management stated that \"we are increasing our investment in capital expenditures in 2025 to approximately $85 billion....\" Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside, but the market could be concerned about deteriorating cash generation due to higher capex forecasts, and shares traded down 1.3% to $187.88 immediately after reporting.\n16. Is Now The Time To Buy Alphabet?\nUpdated: September 2, 2025 at 10:23 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Alphabet.\nThere is a lot to like about Alphabet. First of all, the company\u2019s superb long-term revenue growth driven by Google Cloud Platform signals it has an untapped market opportunity ahead of it. And while its falling cash profitability means it\u2019s investing heavily to keep pace in the AI-race, its lean cost base results in a strong operating margin. On top of that, Alphabet\u2019s stellar ROIC illustrates its historical ability to make home run bets like YouTube and Google Maps.\nAlphabet\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio based on the next 12 months is 22x. Analyzing the consumer internet landscape today, Alphabet\u2019s positive attributes shine bright. We like the stock at this price.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $217.20 on the company (compared to the current share price of $226.30)."

  "argos_summary": "Alphabet shares surged 8.3% after a U.S. judge ruled that Google can keep Chrome and Android, easing breakup fears. The decision removes a major regulatory overhang but imposes limits on exclusive search deals and data sharing. Analysts upgraded the price target to $260 and maintained a buy rating. The rally reflects market confidence in Google's continued dominance, though the stock remains sensitive to broader tech sector volatility.",
