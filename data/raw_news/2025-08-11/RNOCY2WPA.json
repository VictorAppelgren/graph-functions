  "title": "AI cameras help Ford factory workers spot assembly errors and prevent costly recalls",
  "description": "Ford is using AI to analyze photo and video footage and detect factory defects in real time, before problems could become costly recalls or rework.",
  "content": "Every year, more than 300,000 F-150 pickups roll off the line at Ford's Dearborn Truck Plant. The vehicle \u2014 America's best-selling car \u2014 has a complex lineup of trim levels, electrical hardware, wiring harnesses, badges, fenders, and seat variations.As machines whir and workers assemble components with gloved hands, certain new members of the company's quality-assurance team never get distracted: AI-powered cameras.Ford has rolled out two in-house artificial intelligence systems, called AiTriz and MAIVS, to detect factory defects in real time. AiTriz, implemented in December 2024 and named after its Spain-based creator Beatriz Garcia Collado, uses machine learning and video streaming to catch millimeter-scale misalignments. MAIVS, which debuted in January 2024, relies on still images from smartphones mounted on 3D-printed stands that verify all of the correct parts are properly mounted on vehicles.Together, they're helping workers pinpoint issues on the spot \u2014 before problems turn into costly warranty claims, recalls, or rework. It's an area Ford is hoping to improve upon after leading the automotive industry in recalls in four of the past five years.\"Imagine you're an operator, and you're getting a vehicle every minute. You have a number of different tasks you have to complete, and every vehicle is different,\" Jeff Tornabene, who manages vision applications at Ford's Manufacturing Technology and Development Center, told Business Insider. \"When your control system knows the recipe, and your vision system can check it, there are some helpful suspenders there that make sure you're putting the right part on the right vehicle.\"These tools could relieve a billion-dollar headache for Ford. This year, the automaker faced a record 94 recalls, primarily affecting cars built before 2023. It's the most safety bulletins any major car brand has ever posted in an entire calendar year, and it's still early August. Chrysler has the second-highest number of recalls among major automakers, with 21.Those bulletins are costing Ford millions of dollars. For example, a fuel leak recall for 694,271 units of the popular Bronco Sport and Escape SUV models will cost $570 million, according to the Detroit Free Press.The company's AI-supported systems are already making a significant difference on the automaker's manufacturing floors, Patrick Frye, an engineering manager at the Dearborn plant, said.\"It absolutely has helped from an operational standpoint,\" Frye told Business Insider. \"Instead of having to wait for vehicles to hit end-of-line or certain checkpoints, it allows for better in-station process control.\"That kind of speed matters. Before systems like AiTriz, many electrical issues wouldn't surface until the final inspection, if at all, Frye said. Fixing those later often required ripping out carpets or removing seats. And as Ford vehicles gain more screens, sensors, and self-driving hardware, even a slightly loose connection can cause major headaches. For human workers, the tiny difference between a loose part and a good connection can be impossible to catch.\"With our handwear to protect our hands, or the general factory noise, you don't always hear the click, or you can't always feel the snap of two connectors going together,\" Frye said.Brandon Tolsma, a vision engineer at Ford's MTDC, said AI's real-time results are often the difference between a fast fix and a carpet-ripping problem.\"As the vehicle goes through the assembly line, it gets harder and harder to access some of these components,\" Tolsma said. \"I can't stress enough how the real-time results are key in saving us time.\"The systems are now installed at dozens of stations across North America \u2014 AiTriz at 35 stations, and MAIVS at nearly 700. While MAIVS is limited to still images, AiTriz's live video feed offers more precision and adaptability, especially in cases of occlusion (like if a worker walks through a camera's frame or when a sheetmetal component blocks an electrical connection).Previously, some faulty connectors still passed final inspection, since they made basic electrical contact, Tolsma said. But if the plugs weren't fully seated, they could later jostle loose in real-world driving. Ford believes AI cameras are catching those millimeter-off subtleties that factory workers \u2014 even with extensive experience \u2014 might miss, even if it's hidden behind sheet metal and carpeting.\"As the operators are trying to do their job quickly, it can be kind of hard to see, especially if they're some distance away from the electrical connector,\" Tolsma said. \"But with vision, a high-powered camera can see that difference pretty clearly.\"Analysts are cautiously optimistic. David Whiston, a Morningstar analyst who covers Ford, told BI that AI shows long-term promise, but it's still in its early stages.\"I do think AI done effectively could reduce recalls over the next decade and beyond,\" he said. \"But for now, there's no guarantee it'll work. Anything that's more preventative in not only manufacturing but in design and engineering should, in theory, reduce warranty and recall costs.\"For now, Tornabene says the vision tools are meant to assist the manufacturing workforce, not replace it.As models grow more complex, AI systems like AiTriz and MAIVS have the potential to support plant operators who are implementing more advanced sensors, computer chips, and processors to aid Ford's self-driving ambitions, Tornabene told BI. They're also helping to cut through factory noise, ensuring that each car is built as intended.\"This isn't the endpoint for us,\" Tornabene said. \"This is just the start of the plans that we have to make this technology a quality game-changer.\"",

      "text": "- Business Insider recently toured two facilities where Amazon designs and manufactures its robots.\n- Amazon has hundreds of thousands of robots working in its sortation and fulfillment centers.\n- Its facilities give an inside peek at what modern manufacturing looks like.\nInside an unassuming office park in North Reading, Massachusetts, Amazon employees are hard at work building robots to support its vast network of fulfillment centers.\nThis facility, along with another about 50 miles away in Westborough, provides a modern view of US manufacturing.\nPresident Donald Trump has made his pledge to bring manufacturing back to the US a cornerstone of his administration. But there appears to be a growing appetite for reshoring among company CEOs, a recent annual survey from consulting firm Kearney found. While tariffs and geopolitical tensions provide extra incentive to do so, some obstacles remain, the Kearney analysts wrote.\nPeople also aren't necessarily clamoring to work in factories. A poll by the Cato Institute done last year found that while a majority of Americans believed that the US would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, only a small percentage said they personally want to work on a factory floor.\n'A good attitude' and the 'ability to problem solve'\nThe 209,000-square-foot facility in North Reading was previously the home of Kiva Systems before Amazon acquired the mobile robotics company for $775 million in 2012.\nElevated platforms look down on an open floor area where robot models named Hercules and Proteus come off a manufacturing line. They have their batteries charged and systems tested, and then file themselves away to be shipped to fulfillment centers in a process Amazon calls a \"robot graduation.\"\nBoth types of robots transport heavy pods of items around Amazon's fulfillment centers, but while Hercules follows a preordained path marked on the floor, Proteus can sense people and humans in its path and make its own decisions about where to go.\nThere are four manufacturing lines in the facility, each with 10 stations. Lights above each station signal green when everything is in place and red when something is wrong.\nTye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, told Business Insider on a recent visit to the facilities that the company is proud of the fact that it manufactures its robots in Massachusetts.\n\"We know that it can be done and we can do that very efficiently and employ the local workforce,\" Brady said.\nA recent Morgan Stanley report estimated that Amazon's investments in robotics could save the company as much as $10 billion a year.\nAmazon Robotics's facility in Westborough is even larger than the one in North Reading, stretching about 350,000 square feet. In that facility, Amazon workers manufacture robots that can sort, like one called Sequoia that combines several different robotic processes into one storage system. Rows upon rows of cables hang down above containerized robotic storage systems that are testing software updates behind chain-link fences, safely away from human workers.\nBoth the North Reading and Westborough facilities also have corporate offices and research and development labs located directly off the manufacturing floor. Brady said the location is a \"competitive advantage\" because their engineers and manufacturing employees can work together from the start.\n\"And we've created many, many jobs because of that,\" he said.\nErica McClosky, director of manufacturing and technical operations at Amazon Robotics, said that about 300 people work on the more physical tasks involved in building and maintaining a fleet of robots that's more than 750,000 strong.\nThe majority of workers are assemblers who work on the line itself. Another team is responsible for testing robots before they go out to fulfillment centers and for repairing them when they're experiencing issues. There are also employees who receive and ship out the materials needed to assemble the robots. Amazon sources mechanical parts from local suppliers as well as global ones.\nThese employees typically don't need advanced technical knowledge to do their jobs.\n\"Generally, the requirement for us is a good attitude, ability to problem solve, and be curious,\" McClosky said.\nIn addition to those employees, about 150 engineers support and assist them. That includes process engineers who work alongside assemblers as they learn how to build a product, as well as test and quality engineers. Technical program managers bring the whole process together.\n'There's no doubt that we're seeing jobs change'\nBrady said Amazon's work is just the beginning of what's possible in \"physical AI,\" a term used to describe the process of bringing AI to robots that can perceive and react to the real world.\n\"When I speak about physical AI, it would be like us talking about the computer in the '50s,\" he said. \"I really foresee the future filled with physical AI systems that enable and augment a person's capability to do their job.\"\nHe added that the team aims for the robots to be collaborative and always work in concert with humans.\nThe work that happens in Amazon's Massachusetts facilities ultimately plays out in Amazon's sortation and fulfillment centers, where orders are picked, packed, and prepared for delivery. About 75% of the packages that Amazon processes touch at least one of its robotics systems.\nJulie Mitchell, director of robotic sortation technology at Amazon Robotics, said her design teams get direct feedback from operations teams at fulfillment centers so they know what tasks need to be automated and what may or may not be working. Mitchell and McClosky's overall goal is to optimize manufacturing and design so that robots arriving at a fulfillment center are ready to get to work.\n\"We partner really early on to get their feedback at the very beginning of our designs so that we're always going in the right direction with our technology,\" Mitchell said.\nAmazon recently opened a next-generation fulfillment center in Shreveport, Louisiana, with 10 times the number of robots than older fulfillment centers. Brady said that 30% more of the jobs in the Shreveport fulfillment center are more technical in nature than in other locations.\n\"There's no doubt that we're seeing jobs change,\" Brady said.\nBut rather than have robots replace jobs, Brady said that Amazon is committing significant resources to upskilling its employees. That includes technical apprenticeship programs and paying for some employees' college tuition.\n\"You need both people and machines to work together in order to achieve this task,\" he said. \"If you can blend the best of both worlds \u2014 the common sense, the thinking at a higher level, the reasoning, understanding overall building flow, understanding the problems that need to get resolved \u2014 and then let the machines do the menial and mundane and repetitive, then you actually have created a more productive system.\""

      "text": "By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage\nDETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has told investors his electric car company will stop burning cash and turn a profit this year, and corralling costs associated with quality problems will be critical to making good on that pledge.\nWhile Tesla has trimmed its average warranty repair cost per premium electric vehicle since 2014, it still spends more than twice as much as General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, according to a Reuters analysis of company data.\nTesla's warranty costs are also higher than those of Germany's Daimler AG, maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars.\nTesla and other auto makers don't reveal specific figures for warranty costs per vehicle, but they do disclose vehicle deliveries, and total spending for warranty repairs and accruals, representing money set aside for future warranty repair work.\nLast year, according to a Reuters analysis of data provided in the company's annual report, Tesla spent $1,043 per vehicle on actual repairs and set aside $2,036 in warranty accruals to cover future repairs on the vehicles it sold in 2015. It trimmed warranty expenses by 17 percent from 2014 and cut warranty accruals by 34 percent.\nMeanwhile, GM spent just $400 last year for every vehicle it sold on warranty repairs and set aside $332 for future work. Ford spent $429 per vehicle and set aside $308. Daimler spent $970 per vehicle and set aside $1,294.\nWhile Tesla builds only two models and last year sold just 50,000 vehicles, GM, Ford and Daimler all have widely disparate product lines and sell millions of vehicles a year. And where Tesla's 2015 revenue was just over $4 billion, the three larger automakers reported revenues of $150 billion and more.\nRESULTS DUE\nWhen Tesla reports first-quarter results on May 4, analysts will be watching to see whether it is on track to deliver positive cash flow for the year, as Musk forecast in February.\nQuality control and warranty costs are among the challenges as Musk prepares to ramp up production next year for the Model 3 sedan. Tesla plans to boost annual vehicle production over the next several years to roughly ten times the 2015 level.\nIn 2015, Tesla lost a net $888.7 million, and lost $716 million from operations. It ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash, $708 million less than a year earlier. Tesla bolstered its cash balance with $730 million from the sale of new common stock. Total warranty costs were $52.8 million, and it set aside $103 million for future warranty repairs.\nChief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler told analysts in February that as Tesla cars become more reliable, \"that reduces our warranty. That actually has a cash impact when the cars show up less at the service centers.\"\nIn a statement to Reuters, Tesla said it has reduced the cost of first-year repair claims as well as the amount of money it reserves for future warranty repairs.\nAmong other steps, Tesla said it \"aggressively\" issues bulletins to its service centers to \"correct identified issues prior to a failure\" and to \"offer ways to enhance the vehicle after delivery, even (on) non-warranty related items.\"\nCOMPLAINTS\nTesla has been contending with complaints from owners about problems with Model S sedans and the recently launched Model X sport utility vehicle. Some customers have complained on internet forums that doors on their Model X SUVs wouldn't latch properly. Complaints about the Model X were amplified in April when Consumer Reports highlighted problems with the SUV.\nFort Lauderdale Model X owner Colin Campbell told Reuters he loved his car, although he had to drive 30 miles home one day with one hand on the door, trying to keep it shut.\n\"If you want to be one of the first to use the most advanced cars you have to expect you'll have some issues at the beginning,\" he said. Campbell added he \"recognized I'm a beta tester,\" a technology industry term for someone who gets to try a new product in its last stages of development.\nTesla, in a statement to Reuters, said the number of issues the company has dealt with on the Model X has fallen by 400 percent over the past six months. The company has responded to customer complaints by offering to replace faulty sensors that sometimes saw obstacles that weren't there.\nThe company said it issued a bulletin to service technicians to replace components in the mechanism that opened the falcon wing doors to remedy a creaking or groaning sound, and recently changed the design of the door latches. Tesla also fixes issues using over-the-air software upgrades.\n(Editing by Joseph White and Bernadette Baum)"

      "text": "- Ford added a third shift at the F-150 Lightning factory last month.\n- It now plans to build 150,000 Lightnings annually at the EV factory.\n- Startup production goals lag far behind legacy competitors like Ford.\nFord's F-150 Lightning factory in suburban Detroit is now operating on three shifts, ramping up to full capacity as the carmaker rushes to meet demand for the all-electric pickup just named Motor Trend's Truck of the Year.\nFord is adding this new production shift at the same time it completes two large additions to the factory to increase square-footage by some 300,000 square feet, plant manager Corey Williams told reporters at the factory Tuesday morning. The third shift started work late last month, he said.\nThe ultimate goal is for Ford to build 150,000 F-150 Lightnings a year at the Dearborn, Michigan factory, double the company's initial production target. Ford set into motion plans to increase its Lightning build capacity after it had to cap reservations at 200,000 late last year. Through November, Ford had sold 13,258 F-150 Lightning trucks.\nMore than a sign of the truck's popularity, this lofty production goal highlights legacy automakers' advantage over newcomers like Rivian and Lucid when it comes to scaling up. While companies like Ford and GM leverage existing manufacturing footprints and a century's worth of experience building vehicles, startups are struggling with the tricky task of mass-producing vehicles for the first time.\nRivian had built 14,317 of its electric pickup trucks, SUVs, and delivery vans through the end of the third quarter, and is targeting annual production around 25,000 vehicles. Lucid reported it had built 3,687 vehicles in the first nine months of 2022, and is aiming for between 6,000 and 7,000 vehicles for the year.\nFord's global EV sales target for 2023 is 600,000 vehicles, and CEO Jim Farley has said he wants his company to overtake Tesla as the number one seller of electrics in the US. The expansions at Ford's Rouge Electric Vehicle Center are just part of a $30 billion shift toward electric vehicles. Earlier this year, Ford restructured its business to place more focus on its electric division, now called Ford Model e."

      "text": "- Firefighters are using a range of technologies and equipment in their efforts against the fires in California.\n- New AI-powered sensors for detection are paired with kerosene-powered aircraft for suppression.\n- Here are some of the tools on the scene helping to protect lives and property from the flames.\nWith a 27,000-acre inferno bearing down on America's second-largest city, fire crews are using multiple tools at their disposal in their efforts to protect lives and property.\nCalifornia firefighters have a range of old and new technologies to aid in their task, ranging from AI-powered sensors for fire detection to kerosene-powered aircraft for suppression.\nUS and Canadian water bomber planes and helicopters have been some of the most prominent pieces of equipment in the field as they scoop up seawater to quench the blazes nearby.\nLess visible forms of tech are also contributing to the effort \u2014 sometimes without any initial human involvement.\nUC San Diego's ALERTCalifornia project now has a network of cameras at high-risk sites, with 115 located in Los Angeles County alone, with more than 1,140 cameras across the state.\nLast month, Orange County fire officials credited the system for being instrumental in their first AI detection of a vegetation fire, which allowed first responders to contain the incident to less than a quarter acre.\nStartups are getting involved too. Sonia Kastner, CEO and cofounder of the Salesforce Ventures-backed startup Pano AI, told Business Insider that new trends in firefighting are shifting as fire seasons worsen, with an increased focus on early detection and rapid containment.\n\"You can think of it as similar to how we treat cancer,\" Kastner said. \"We screen early, then treat cancer aggressively at stage one, so that it never becomes stage four.\"\nRather than relying on bystander reports, Kastner says cameras and analysts can provide first responders with quicker confirmations and more precise locations.\n\" It's a matter of luck of whether a bystander sees the fire,\" Kastner said. \" And then there's a mandatory confirmation step where a single fire engine is dispatched to drive around and try to find the fire. With that, you lose hours.\"\nSatellites and drones are also taking a more significant role in wildfire management and response, offering drastic before-and-after comparisons of the fire's effects.\nThe cameras and sensors are only good for letting responders know where a fire is \u2014 getting it under control still requires the use of more physical kinds of tech.\nThe US Forest Service's website details the range of aircraft it uses to respond to wildfires, ranging from single-engine air tankers that can deliver up to 800 gallons of fire retardant, to larger air tankers that carry up to 4,000 gallons and water scoopers that collect water from nearby sources.\nIn addition to government planes, aircraft from private sector partner Coulson Aviation, which has a contract with Los Angeles County \u2014 have also been spotted dousing flames.\nIn particular, the Canada-based company operates a fleet of specialized helicopters that can drop water with a high degree of accuracy, though high winds in recent days have complicated the effort.\n\"The Coulson Crew is currently on the frontlines of the Palisades Fire in California. We remain dedicated to supporting suppression efforts and safeguarding lives and property,\" the company said in a post on X.\nMeanwhile, crews on the ground continue to rely on tools and techniques developed over a century of modern firefighting, with hoses, chainsaws, and even buckets.\nIt's hard, dangerous work, but modern technologies are helping responders on the ground and in the air do the job more effectively."

      "text": "- Why have there been so many product recalls lately?\n- Data shows that product recalls increased 11% from 2022 to 2023, reaching a seven-year high.\n- A large part of it is that regulations around food safety have gotten stricter.\nWhat's with all the product recalls lately?\nIn the past two weeks alone, the FDA has tracked a dozen recalls, market withdrawals, and safety alerts for products ranging from ground cinnamon to eye ointment to chocolate bars.\nTrader Joe's, for example, has already recalled at least six items so far this year. Its chicken soup dumplings were recalled last week over fears that they could contain plastic.\nIt's not just a coincidence; recalls are on the rise.\nFrom 2022 to 2023, the number of product recalls increased by 11%, hitting a seven-year high, according to a 2024 State of the Nation Recall Index report from Sedgwick Brand Protection.\nThe report found 3,301 recall events in 2023 across five industries: automotive, consumer product, food and drink, medical device, and pharmaceutical, Sedgwick said in a press release.\nAlthough the number of recalls increased last year for the second year in a row, Sedgwick said that the number of defective units \u2014 whether that's an individual car or a single packet of food \u2014 decreased nearly 50% compared to 2022.\nAnd it wasn't just 2023 that saw a rise in the total number of recalls.\nBetween 2018 and 2022, recalls from both the FDA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission increased 115%, according to research from quality-control software company MasterControl.\nThe most common reasons for recalls between both agencies include allergens, foodborne illnesses, contamination risks, child safety, and fire hazards, according to MasterControl's report.\nBut allergies, illnesses, and safety concerns have always been around, so what's behind the surge in recalls?\nUnsurprisingly, there's no singular reason, but one factor may be stricter regulations.\nThe Food Safety Modernization Act \u2014 the biggest amendment to food safety laws in decades \u2014 was passed in 2011. It established stricter regulations and gave the FDA greater power to order recalls from manufacturers.\nThe pandemic also created more rigorous guidelines for product safety.\nAt the height of the pandemic, the FDA had to do a lot of its testing and inspections remotely, which meant it had to adopt more stringent policies to make sure products were safe, MasterControl explained.\nWhile some of those policies lapsed when the COVID-19 public health emergency ended, others remain in place.\nAnd more regulations may be coming in 2024.\n\"As product recalls reached a seven-year high in 2023, it is clear that strict regulatory enforcement is more than a passing trend,\" Chris Harvey, a Senior Vice President at Sedgwick, said in the press release.\n\"2024 will see continued oversight from regulators, policymakers, and consumers, making it essential for businesses to plan and practice for product recalls and in-market crises.\""

      "text": "- General Motors is using AI to enhance vehicle production, maintenance, and marketing.\n- Still, GM has faced challenges to AI adoption, such as scalable infrastructure and employee support.\n- This article is part of \"How AI Is Changing Everything,\" a series on AI adoption across industries.\nAt General Motors' Detroit-based electric vehicle assembly plant, Factory Zero, artificial intelligence and machine learning are playing an increasingly significant role.\nAI-based vision systems can swiftly identify maintenance issues, such as battery leaks, damaged metal components, and patchy paintwork. Marketing teams use AI tools to analyze consumer behavior and adapt their market research and promotional efforts.\nAs General Motors looks to retain its crown as America's biggest car manufacturer amid increased competition from rivals, corporate leaders see AI as key to its success.\nMeeting customers where they are\nJon Francis, chief data and analytics officer at GM, said artificial intelligence is contributing to change across the company. For one thing, he said, AI is helping GM reach consumers at the \"right moment\" on their car-buying journeys, enabling the carmaker to adjust production lines in \"real time\" to meet demand.\nUsing data points like customer interactions and sales and manufacturing metrics, GM's AI solutions can provide insights on how to adjust production to ensure vehicles offer the features customers want most. Francis said examples include \"seamless connectivity,\" safety features in tune with drivers' personal needs and those of their passengers, as well as traditional and electric engines. The AI solutions can also ensure anomalies are spotted and fixed before customers receive their new cars.\nFrancis said the technology is also providing new GM customers with a more enjoyable driving experience. For example, with the help of AI and machine learning, GM is working with organizations like Pilot and EVgo to find the most optimal locations for EV charging stations, enabling GM drivers to power up more easily. Decisions are made by algorithm-based analyses of traffic flow and nearby EV chargers, in addition to the knowledge of human experts.\nA look at the automotive landscape\nGM's leaders aren't the only ones turning to AI to drive growth. The tech is making waves across the automotive sector more broadly. Research from Global Market Insights shows that AI automotive technology is a $4.8 billion industry and could reach $186.4 billion over the next decade.\nAs evidenced by General Motors, AI is improving efficiencies on automotive production lines and in maintenance warehouses. But this technology is also delivering benefits for the end user by overhauling the driving experience.\nWyatt Mayham, cofounder and CEO of IT consultancy Northwest AI Consulting, said that by embracing AI technologies, automotive companies may be able to design and sell \"enhanced driver assistance systems\" with features such as better automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assistance.\nTariq Munir, an AI transformation advisor, also envisages a bright future for AI automotive technologies. In particular, he expects to see automakers leverage \"smart, self-optimizing systems\" that will \"enable production optimization and supply chain planning with near-perfect accuracy.\"\nHe said automakers may be able to reduce vehicle-testing costs by performing tests virtually by combining AI with immersive technologies like augmented and virtual reality.\n\"This is the smart factory revolution in the making,\" he said, \"which will enable a faster, cheaper, and more sustainable automotive industry.\"\nEarly obstacles\nDespite some success so far, GM's AI and ML transformation journey could face challenges. One was ensuring its AI solutions could deliver long-term, tangible benefits for all customers, which requires ample data. Therefore, Francis said, he and his team spent significant time implementing a robust IT infrastructure to collect, process, and analyze large datasets.\nThis digital environment also had to be scalable from the beginning to facilitate the rapid expansion of AI adoption across GM's various departments, so Francis and his team built a \"scaled compute environment.\" This is a type of IT infrastructure that features self-adjusting compute resources, like processing power and storage, to cater to organizational and employee needs as they change over time.\nResistance to change is another common pitfall of AI adoption within companies. Some workers are understandably concerned that AI could replace them, and using this technology can be overwhelming for those new to it.\nWith these concerns in mind, Francis said it's essential for business leaders to take time to understand employees' concerns about AI and provide adequate support and reassurance so that they get the most out of the tech. According to Francis, GM believes AI should augment, not replace, workers.\n\"At GM, we view AI as a tool to enhance job functions, allowing our highly skilled workforce to focus on tasks that humans are uniquely qualified to do, and machines simply cannot perform. Once people see the powerful benefits of using AI, resistance drops rapidly,\" Francis added.\nCustomized tools could be coming soon\nChallenges aside, Francis and other industry leaders remain optimistic about the future of the automotive industry and the role of AI. For Francis, customers will increasingly demand vehicles tailored to their specific needs and packed with advanced safety and connectivity features.\n\"AI and data analytics are helping us deliver exactly that across our entire lineup, whether someone is looking for a traditional engine or going electric,\" he said.\"Through AI solutions, we're able to create better experiences for every type of customer and every price point.\"\nThis sentiment is echoed by Royston Jones, the global head of automotive at computational intelligence firm Altair, who said customers want \"more personalized, energy-efficient, and safer\" vehicles. These are things he thinks AI will continue to enable in the years ahead in the automotive industry.\n\"In the long run,\" he told Business Insider, \"AI will push the industry toward mass customization, shorter development cycles, and sustainable innovation that aligns with shifting customer values and regulatory demands.\""
