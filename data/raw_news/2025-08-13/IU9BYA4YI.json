  "title": "Fantasy football WR tiers for 2025: Ranking best fantasy options",
  "description": "Fantasy football rankings are cool, but tier lists might be better. Here's how the fantasy football WRs shake out in 2025.",
  "content": "With fantasy football mock drafts well underway and actual fantasy drafts around the corner, there's no better time to look into which players to select. And there's no better position to seek out advice than at wide receiver, where the right player can make the difference between winning and losing.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports has compiled a tiered list of the wide receivers to add to fantasy football teams ahead of the 2025 season, starting from the top, most elite tier and trickling down to top FLEX player options.\n\nHere's how this year's wide receivers field is looking:\n\nRather than numbering the tiers, this list will divide up wide receivers by the role they could play on a fantasy football team: potential league-winners, good-to-great WR1s, fringe WR1/WR2 options, solid WR2s and top FLEX players.\n\nHere's how everything shakes out among the top 35 fantasy wide receivers:\n\nWhen it comes to fantasy wideouts, these two players are in a league of their own.\n\nChase won the receiving triple crown last season with his 127 catches for 1,708 yards and 17 touchdowns. In standard leagues, that was worth a whopping 16 fantasy points per game. In PPR leagues, that number surges to 23.7 fantasy points per game. Chase was putting up the kind of ridiculous fantasy-point numbers on a weekly basis that other elite wideouts only did in their best weeks.\n\nFor Jefferson, last season cemented his status as a quarterback-proof wide receiver. He had a fifth-straight 1,000-yard season to open his career, tallying 1,533 total, and matched a career high with 10 touchdowns. Regardless of who's throwing the football \u2013 Kirk Cousins, Josh Dobbs, Nick Mullens, Sam Darnold and this year, J.J. McCarthy \u2013 Jefferson is producing at a consistently high level.\n\nThe next tier is a group projected to be the top target-getters on their respective teams who have proven a proclivity for production in fantasy football.\n\nNacua is officially the Rams' top wide receiver after Los Angeles released veteran Cooper Kupp earlier in the offseason. Nabers broke out as a rookie last year despite turmoil under center in New York and should benefit from more consistency there this year.\n\nSt. Brown has had two straight seasons as a first-team All-Pro receiver and had a career-high 12 scores last season. Collins was a Pro Bowler last year and had a second-straight 1,000-yard season despite missing five games. And Lamb is riding a four-year 1,000-yard streak despite missing his starting quarterback for more than half of last season.\n\nThe next tier of players is a group that might have top wide receiver potential.\n\nIt includes a couple of second-year receivers looking to fully establish themselves after strong debuts, plus a couple of elite players who will attempt to bounce back after relatively disappointing seasons.\n\nRounding out the group is a handful of players coming off breakout performances who will be trying to prove last year wasn't a flash in the pan.\n\nThe biggest question marks here are Wilson, who is the only wideout playing with a brand-new quarterback (Justin Fields) in this tier, and London, whose quarterback (Michael Penix Jr.) is in his second year and still looking to prove himself.\n\nMany of the players in this tier are No. 2 wide receivers for their respective, pass-happy teams. Others are guys with solid potential who have not had a long enough history of consistent, outstanding production to be considered among those in the fringe-WR1 tier.\n\nThe two biggest names here are Harrison and McMillan, the former being a popular breakout pick this year and the latter being the top name among rookie standouts.\n\nMaking up the final tier are players who may have much higher ceilings than a WR3/FLEX designation but also have lower floors thanks to the questions associated with each name.\n\nHow long will Rice be suspended for his involvement in a high-speed crash and recent guilty plea? How will Ridley fare with a new, rookie quarterback throwing him the football? Will Godwin bounce back from a gruesome ankle injury? How much will Hunter play on offense? Is Jennings going to continue his holdout with the 49ers in hopes of a new contract, and if not, will his production decline with Brandon Aiyuk's return?\n\nIs Addison going to eclipse 1,000 yards for the first time while he still competes for targets with Jefferson? How will Meyers deal with a new QB and significantly higher competition for targets? How much will Waddle benefit from a bounce-back from his quarterback in Miami? How will Williams fit into the Lions' new offensive coordinator's scheme, and is he the team's true No. 2 receiver? Is Jeudy going to be as productive without clarity on which of Cleveland's five quarterbacks will be throwing him the ball?\n\nAll of the above are some of the important questions that will only be answered once the regular season gets underway in a few weeks.",

      "text": "Fantasy football RB rankings: Bijan Robinson or Saquon Barkley at No. 1?\nThe end of July means preseason football is just around the corner for teams across the NFL. For some, it's already here: the Hall of Fame game July 31 pits the Los Angeles Chargers against Detroit Lions to open football for the 2025 season.\nThat means we're getting closer to fantasy football draft season for millions of managers deciding how best to fill out their rosters, including at running back.\nAs in 2023, last year's top fantasy running back, Saquon Barkley, earned Offensive Player of the Year honors in real life while winning plenty of fantasy football leagues for managers across the country. He also will be featured on the cover of Madden, following fully in Christian McCaffrey's footsteps a year prior.\nThis year could be an intriguing one for the running back position. One of the most talented draft classes in years gave dozens of teams viable rookie starters or rotational players. Returning stars like Barkley and McCaffrey face some question marks in the wake of their standout seasons.\nThat's a lot to sort through for fantasy managers but don't worry, USA TODAY Sports has you covered with the top 50 running backs in fantasy football this season.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nFantasy football rankings: RB\n1. Bijan Robinson, Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons were one of the best rushing offenses in the league last season. They lost starting center Drew Dalman in free agency but the offense as a whole could take a step forward in year two with QB Michael Penix. Robinson improved in 2024 without racking up too much mileage. He's one of the most talented running backs in the league. Don't overthink it.\n2. Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles. Barkley had an outstanding 2024 season but history is not on his side to replicate that success. He had 378 total touches in the regular season; each of the nine running backs to hit more than 370 in the last decade saw a significant drop-off in production the following year. He's still this high thanks to one of the best offensive lines in the league.\n3. Ashton Jeanty, Las Vegas Raiders. This absolutely could be too high for a rookie running back, especially one running behind an offensive line with some question marks. But the Raiders offense is an anomaly. The only weapon ahead of Jeanty in the pecking order is tight end Brock Bowers. Las Vegas offensive coordinator Chip Kelly has evolved as an offensive play-caller and Jeanty should benefit with his generational traits.\n4. Jahmyr Gibbs, Detroit Lions. What the Lions offense will be without longtime coordinator Ben Johnson is one of the biggest questions across the NFL in 2025. Gibbs is a game-breaking weapon for new coordinator John Morton, who schemed the 2017 Jets into a top-20 rushing attack led by Bilal Powell and a 32-year-old Matt Forte in his last coordinator job. Detroit continued its investment in the offensive line in the draft and that should give fantasy owners confidence despite the changes.\n5. Derrick Henry, Baltimore Ravens. He can't keep doing this forever but we won't be the ones too early on King Henry's drop-off. He had 2,114 yards from scrimmage in his first season in Baltimore. Even with the threat of Lamar Jackson and the return of the speedy Keaton Mitchell, Henry is the No. 1 ball-carrier for one of the best rushing offenses in the league.\n6. Josh Jacobs, Green Bay Packers. Jacobs was RB5 in standard scoring last season and Green Bay invested in the offensive line even more in free agency and the draft. A healthy Jordan Love in 2025 could impact Jacobs' share of the offensive load but not enough to negatively affect his overall production.\n7. De'Von Achane, Miami Dolphins. Achane was a top-10 RB in 2024 and especially valuable in PPR leagues with a career-high 78 catches for 592 yards and six touchdowns. Raheem Mostert is now in Las Vegas and that should give Achane more of the rushing load even as Jaylen Wright takes on a bigger role.\n8. James Cook, Buffalo Bills. Cook is still participating in training camp even as he looks for a contract extension. He was a touchdown machine in 2024 but had just 1,267 yards from scrimmage, the lowest total among the top 10 fantasy running backs. He should still be a top-10 fantasy back this season thanks to a top-tier offense, even if his touchdown total regresses.\n9. Bucky Irving, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Irving was one of the biggest surprises in the NFL last season thanks to his breakout year in which he was remarkably efficient on a per-touch basis. His ceiling may be capped by Rachaad White's presence in the passing game, a top-tier wide receiving corps and a new play-caller but he's still running behind a top-tier offensive line. He's got one of the highest floors in the league entering year two.\n10. Christian McCaffrey, San Francisco 49ers. McCaffrey may be the toughest running back to project for 2025. He looks to be fully healthy after a tumultuous 2024 season that saw him fail to find the end zone for the first time in his career. The 49ers drafted Jordan James in Round 5 this year and Isaac Guerendo could take on a bigger role in Year 2. San Francisco is facing uncertainty in the receiving corps so McCaffrey could be relied upon early in the season to shoulder the load.\n11. Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts. Taylor may have won (or lost) many fantasy football championships in 2024 thanks to his string of top-five performances from Weeks 16-18. Indianapolis has question marks at quarterback as well as interior offensive line and Taylor hasn't played a full season since 2021. That's a lot of concern but he's still one of the top runners in the NFL when healthy.\n12. Chuba Hubbard, Carolina Panthers. Hubbard hit 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns for the first time in his career last season. Things could be even better in 2025 thanks to the Panthers' passing offense potentially taking a step forward with wideout Tetairoa McMillan's arrival. He should keep defenses from focusing on stopping the run when lining up against Carolina's offense.\n13. Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers. Behind Jeanty, Hampton was in his own tier of running back prospects in the 2025 NFL draft. He's in a perfect spot to be a contributor early on. Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh wants to win by running the ball effectively. Hampton should enjoy running behind two of the top young tackles in the league and will have plenty of opportunity to showcase his skills as a receiver.\n14. Kenneth Walker III, Seattle Seahawks. Seattle has a new coordinator with Klint Kubiak and that should lead to running the ball much more effectively than in 2024. The game plan will likely feature a lot of outside zone, which plays into Walker's skillset. Zach Charbonnet may vulture some carries, but all signs point to Walker enjoying his best season in Seattle to date, pending health.\n15. Chase Brown, Cincinnati Bengals. Brown was a top-six fantasy RB in all scoring formats from Week 9 on in 2025. Cincinnati should have better play at both guard spots on the offensive line and feature the best wide receiver duo in the league. Rookie Tahj Brooks is a powerful runner and could work into a role sooner than later, but that should alleviate injury concerns for Brown without eating into his production too much.\n16. Kyren Williams, Los Angeles Rams. Williams had more carries (316) than all but two running backs in the NFL (Henry and Barkley) last season but finished as RB6 or RB7, depending on the format. Williams is looking for an extension and the Rams added Jarquez Hunter in the draft. The volume should be there but he may not make the most of it.\n17. Breece Hall, New York Jets. Hall entered last season viewed as one of the top RBs in fantasy and ended the year outside of the top 15 in all formats. He's in great position to have a better year in 2025 with a new offensive coordinator in Tanner Engstrand, a bolstered offensive line and a dual-threat quarterback in Justin Fields.\n18. Aaron Jones Sr., Minnesota Vikings. Jones was a top-20 running back in 2024 despite reaching the end zone just seven times. Minnesota overhauled the interior of its offensive line and that shows an intent to run the ball more and more effectively. With first-year starter J.J. McCarthy taking over at quarterback, Jones' ceiling is much higher than a year ago, even with Jordan Mason now in town.\n19. Alvin Kamara, New Orleans Saints. New Orleans is welcoming a new offensive play-caller in head coach Kellen Moore, upgrades on the offensive line and lots of questions at quarterback. Kamara's well past his prime as a top-10 fantasy RB but should have a high floor in what could be a run-first offense.\n20. James Conner, Arizona Cardinals. Conner was a fringe top-10 running back last season in one of the most diverse running schemes in the league. Cardinals running game coordinator Klayton Adams is now the offensive coordinator in Dallas, which could affect Conner and the offense as he reaches his age-30 season.\n21. Kaleb Johnson, Pittsburgh Steelers. Johnson is another rookie running back in a good situation. Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith will welcome his skillset and there's a chance the Steelers offensive line can become one of the best in the league.\n22. TreVeyon Henderson, New England Patriots. Henderson is New England's most dynamic playmaker on offense entering 2025. Rhamondre Stevenson may be ahead of him on the depth chart, but it'd be a surprise if offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels limits his touches as a rookie.\n23. D'Andre Swift, Chicago Bears. New Bears head coach and offensive play-caller Ben Johnson schemed up one of the top offenses in the league in Detroit based on a potent running game. Swift could benefit from the new hire and upgrades on the offensive line.\n24. RJ Harvey, Denver Broncos. Denver signed veteran J.K. Dobbins, but the dynamic rookie Harvey should be a threat as a runner and receiver. Even with Dobbins and Audric Estime in the building, Harvey will have a big role.\n25. Tyrone Tracy Jr., New York Giants. Tracy had a strong rookie season last year and could improve in Year 2, especially in half- and full-PPR leagues thanks to his background as a receiver. New York has a tough schedule in 2025, three potential starting quarterbacks and added to the running back room in free agency and the draft. That makes Tracy a risky pick.\n26. Joe Mixon, Houston Texans. Mixon will miss significant time with a foot injury and that's a tough outlook entering the 2025 season under a new offensive coordinator. He's going into his age-29 season behind an offensive line with plenty of question marks.\n27. David Montgomery, Detroit Lions. Only seven RBs had more rushing touchdowns than Montgomery last season, but he barely cracked 1,000 yards from scrimmage. If that scoring total takes a dip with a change in coordinator and a larger role for Gibbs, that could knock Montgomery down from low-end RB2 status.\n28. Isiah Pacheco, Kansas City Chiefs. Pacheco struggled in 2024 following a fractured fibula early in the season. He'll be contending for touches with free agent addition Elijah Mitchell and rookie Brashard Smith but should still be the lead back. That gives him a high floor entering 2025.\n29. Tony Pollard, Tennessee Titans. Tennessee upgraded everything around the running back position this offseason and Pollard should benefit. There will be multiple new starters on the offensive line, an upgraded receiving corps and a No. 1 pick at quarterback. That's much improved from his RB21 circumstances a year ago.\n30. Brian Robinson Jr., Washington Commanders. Washington upgraded its offensive line and should take a step under second-year coordinator Kliff Kingsbury and quarterback Jayden Daniels. But Robinson isn't much of a threat as a receiver, especially with Austin Ekeler still on the roster, which keeps his ceiling low despite a high floor.\n31. Zach Charbonnet, Seattle Seahawks. Walker will be the lead back in Seattle but hasn't played a full season since entering the league in 2022. That makes Charbonnet one of the top handcuff options in fantasy this year with RB3 potential in an offense lacking playmakers outside of Walker and Jaxon Smith-Njigba.\n32. Jaylen Warren, Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers opted to re-sign Warren this offseason and he should benefit from the improved offensive line. Johnson may shoulder a lot of the rushing load, but Warren could be a sleeper in PPR leagues as Pittsburgh's pass-catching group lacks much beyond D.K. Metcalf.\n33. Javonte Williams, Dallas Cowboys: Williams is one of two free agent additions alongside Miles Sanders in a new-look Cowboys backfield. New offensive coordinator Klayton Adams helped design a creative running scheme in Arizona. That could benefit Williams and the other runners in Dallas.\n34. Jordan Mason, Minnesota Vikings. Mason moved from San Francisco to Minnesota this offseason and his outlook significantly improved. Aaron Jones is entering his age-31 season and the Vikings should run the ball enough to make Mason an attractive handcuff with RB3 potential.\n35. Travis Etienne Jr., Jacksonville Jaguars. New Jaguars coach Liam Coen maximized a backfield with Rachaad White, Bucky Irving and Sean Tucker in Tampa Bay last year. It's unclear early how the touches will be divvied up in Jacksonville with Etienne competing with Tank Bigsby and rookie Bhayshul Tuten.\n36. Rhamondre Stevenson, New England Patriots. Stevenson is the lead returning ball-carrier in New England but Henderson's dynamic potential could eat into his opportunities. The Patriots offensive line shouldn't be nearly as bad as a year ago, giving some potential for Stevenson as a low-end RB3.\n37. Nick Chubb, Houston Texans. With Mixon facing an injury in training camp, Chubb could be a surprise contributor early on in 2025. Houston has a first-year offensive coordinator and a new-look offensive line but the carries could be there for Chubb as Mixon works his way back to health.\n38. Dylan Sampson, Cleveland Browns. Cleveland's offense is full of question marks at quarterback and running back. Second-round pick Quinshon Judkins remains unsigned behind incumbent Jerome Ford. Sampson's abilities in the receiving game give him the edge over Ford here.\n39. J.K. Dobbins, Denver Broncos. Dobbins was an early-season fantasy darling last year before injury cut into his production. He and rookie RJ Harvey figure to share carries but Harvery should be the more explosive option, lowering Dobbins' ceiling.\n40. Rachaad White, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. White will be playing under his third offensive coordinator in the last three seasons. New coordinator Josh Grizzard was the passing game coordinator last year, which could see White's value as a receiver continue ... but Irving could eat even more into his share of the carries out of the backfield.\n41. Tyler Allgeier, Atlanta Falcons. Allgeier is one of the top handcuffs this season and has the track record to produce should Robinson miss time with injury. There may not be enough carries to go around if Robinson is in the lineup, though, capping Allgeier's ceiling.\n42. Najee Harris, Los Angeles Chargers. Harris is recovering from an eye injury and that could knock his already low fantasy outlook this season. But given how much the Chargers will likely want to run the ball, he should get steady carries behind Hampton in 2025. Just not enough to move him out of RB4 territory.\n43. Cam Skattebo, New York Giants. Skattebo will pair with Tracy in the Giants backfield, but things are bleak given the schedule, quarterback situation and offensive line. He showed off his skills as a receiver in college, which improves his outlook.\n44. Jaydon Blue, Dallas Cowboys. While Williams and Sanders may start the year with the most touches, look for Blue to get a bigger role as the season wears on. He's a proven receiver out of the backfield with dynamic ability in open space. In an offense lacking playmakers, watch out for him to improve as the season moves along.\n45. Tank Bigsby, Jacksonville Jaguars. Bigsby could see a bigger role with Coen now in Jacksonville, but his lack of receiving chops means he'll likely be pigeonholed in a crowded backfield. His best outlook is to take over as the early-down runner from Etienne and churn out yards behind an improved offensive line.\n46. Isaac Guerendo, San Francisco 49ers. Guerendo played well in a couple of starts as a rookie. McCaffrey is back and healthy in 2025 but Guerendo could be a top handcuff with rookie Jordan James offering potential as an early-down running back.\n47. Tyjae Spears, Tennessee Titans. Spears should benefit from the Titans' improved offense, though not as much as Pollard. He struggled with injury last season but looks set for a bigger role as the primary pass-catching back in Tennessee's offense.\n48. Roschon Johnson, Chicago Bears. New coach Ben Johnson used two running backs very effectively during his time in Detroit. That bumps Johnson's potential in 2025 to have a role akin to David Montgomery in recent years. That makes him a worthwhile late-round flyer.\n49. Brashard Smith, Kansas City Chiefs. Pacheco is the hard-nosed runner leading the way in Kansas City but Smith could be the dynamic receiving option out of the backfield. His background as a receiver should give him a role similar to what Jerick McKinnon had in years past.\n50. Trey Benson, Arizona Cardinals. Benson could see a bigger role in his sophomore season in Arizona as Conner gets one year older with a history of missing games with injury. He's a worthwhile handcuff with potential for a larger share of carries in 2025."

It\u2019s always fascinating to see where top rookies like Travis Hunter, Ashton Jeanty and Tetairoa McMillan are selected.\nMock drafts are a helpful tool for deciphering position value. Some years, wide receivers fly off of the board, while mocks can also be an identifier of the running backs who are most highly coveted.\nIt's never too early to start preparing for the fantasy football season.

      "text": "Fantasy football injury updates: Latest on Justin Jefferson, Brandon Aiyuk, more\nFootball is back \u2013 and so are football injuries.\nWith fantasy drafts right around the corner, the injury report will, once again, become a big part of every football fan's daily life. Whether it's players that saw the 2024 season come to an early conclusion or others that had some sort of ailment over the offseason, you'll want to have all the latest information before making an investment in your draft.\nThere are multiple quarterbacks, running backs and receivers that are already banged up \u2013 even though training camps haven't been open for a week.\nUnfortunately for the players, no repellent is warding off the injury bug.\nHere is the latest on some of the fantasy-relevant players across the league.\nFantasy Football injury report\nQuarterbacks\nJustin Fields, New York Jets: Fields went down with a toe injury in practice on July 24 after he was stepped on. Carted off the field following the injury, it was later revealed that the quarterback had a dislocated toe. He returned to practice on July 25 after initially being listed as day-to-day.\nMatthew Stafford, Los Angeles Rams: The 37-year-old is starting training camp on the side as he battles back soreness. The Rams don't seem concerned about Stafford, who is entering his 17th NFL season. At this point in his career, it comes as no surprise that L.A. will take every precaution \u2013 especially at this stage of training camp.\nRunning Backs\nNajee Harris, Los Angeles Chargers: The Los Angeles Chargers officially placed the running back on the active/non-football injury (NFI) list on July 17 after a fireworks incident left Harris with a superficial eye injury during the early morning hours on July 5. He made his first appearance at training camp on July 25, wearing sunglasses and a hoodie \u2013 covering up the injury. It's unclear when Harris will return and that creates an opening for rookie Omarion Hampton to lead the backfield from Day 1.\nJoe Mixon, Houston Texans: Mixon was placed on the NFI list as training camp began thanks to an ankle injury he suffered over the offseason. KPRC2's Aaron Wilson reported that the team will look to gradually ease Mixon back into practice when the time comes, but the outlook remains positive entering the 2025 season. Despite some additional competition in the running back room, Mixon doesn't figure to be a player in danger of losing snaps.\nWide Receivers\nJustin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings: Head coach Kevin O'Connell announced on July 25 that Jefferson suffered a mild hamstring strain, which will keep him out for a week before the team reevaluates him. The star receiver is quarterback-proof, but there is some fear about the pesky nature of hamstring injuries. Since the issue popped up early in training camp, there is still plenty of time for Jefferson to recover and keep fantasy managers' minds at ease.\nBrandon Aiyuk, San Francisco 49ers: After a contract dispute prior to the 2024 season, Aiyuk eventually received the long-term deal he was looking for. Unfortunately for him, that was one of the only positive things he received from a football standpoint as a torn ACL and MCL ended his season in Week 7. He was placed on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list and general manager John Lynch said on July 22 that the team doesn't have a timeline for his return yet. The potential for missing regular season games would be a big hit to Aiyuk's fantasy stock, especially with his production already in danger of dropping in his first season back.\nStefon Diggs, New England Patriots: Diggs' fantasy stock was given a boost after head coach Mike Vrabel said he will begin training camp without any physical restrictions. The receiver steps into New England as the clear WR1, which is something he couldn't say last season in Houston.\nDarnell Mooney, Atlanta Falcons: Mooney left practice on July 24 with an undisclosed injury after attempting a diving catch in practice. The Falcons didn't provide an update on the receiver's status and followed it up by signing D.J. Chark on July 25. Mooney is looking to build off a career year as the Falcons' WR2, but he'll need to establish a better connection with Michael Penix Jr. to make that a reality.\nChristian Watson, Green Bay Packers: Injuries continue to be a big part of the story for Watson, who has game-wrecking potential when healthy. It's been tough to put it all together and become one of fantasy's best weapons, however, as Watson has played in just 38 of a potential 51 regular season games over three years. He likely won't be ready in time for the regular season after suffering a torn ACL in the Packers' final regular season game last season, diminishing whatever fantasy value he still has. The presence of Matthew Golden doesn't help, either, relegating Watson to a potential matchup-based flex option at best if he returns to form. For now, stay away.\nChris Godwin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Godwin is beginning training camp on the PUP list as he works his way back from a season-ending ankle injury suffered in Week 7 of the 2024 season. The receiver elected to re-sign with Tampa this offseason, inking a three-year, $66 million deal with the club. Now the focus is on his rehab, which required a second ankle surgery this offseason, according to ESPN's Jenna Laine. He will have to come off the PUP list by roster cutdown day, however, or he will have to miss the first four games of the season. The receiver was on pace to set new career-highs across the board before his injury. If he's healthy, Godwin will remain a top-tier fantasy receiver.\nTank Dell, Houston Texans: Dell went down with a devastating knee injury in Week 16 of the 2024 season. He dislocated his knee on the play, damaged his meniscus and tore his ACL, MCL and LCL. Dell has had multiple surgeries this offseason. He won't be a fantasy factor in 2025."

      "text": "Fantasy football D/ST rankings 2025: What NFL defenses can you trust?\nIn real life, it's said that defense wins championships. In fantasy football, defense is nothing more than a thorn in your side.\nThe ever-evolving world of fantasy football has seen some changes in recent years, making the removal of defenses a more acceptable league format.\nFor some, it's preferred. For others, it's taking the easy way out.\nIf you are someone who celebrates tradition and enjoys the defensive mayhem that can occur on a football field, this is for you.\nWhat are the best fantasy football defenses in 2025? Here's a look at USA TODAY's preseason fantasy D/ST rankings.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nFantasy football rankings: D/ST\n1. Denver Broncos. Despite a difficult division and a middle-of-the-road schedule, the Broncos maintain their hold on the top spot until proven otherwise. They were fantasy's best unit in 2024 and added talent in the offseason. With the Titans and Colts on tap to start the season, Denver can get out to a hot start. Couple that with a favorable schedule for the fantasy playoffs, including two matchups at home, and there is recipe for success.\n2. Houston Texans. The Texans benefit from playing in a division that will feature a rookie quarterback in Tennessee and a situation in Indianapolis that will have defensive coordinators salivating. An aggressive DeMeco Ryans defense should only make life more difficult, especially after adding C.J. Gardner-Johnson to the fold. They can challenge for the best fantasy D/ST of 2025.\n3. Philadelpia Eagles. Philly lost Milton Williams, Josh Sweat and Darius Slay, but is littered with talent across the board. After a dominant Super Bowl performance, there is more than enough here to continue their strong play.\n4. Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens are the fast food of the fantasy D/ST realm. It's consistent and you know exactly what you're getting. Sometimes they're better than expected, but it's never bad enough to prevent you from coming back. That counts for something.\n5. Pittsburgh Steelers. Another fantasy staple, Pittsburgh has gone all-in for 2025. T.J. Watt's contract dispute ended before it became an issue and the secondary got an upgrade in Jalen Ramsey. Coming off another top-5 finish in 2024, this remains one of the more consistent units to trust in fantasy.\n6. Minnesota Vikings. Brian Flores runs an aggressive defense, but J.J. McCarthy being an unknown could put this unit in some tough spots this season. Some key departures mean they're likely to take a step back, but not by much. Still, this isn't a D/ST for the risk averse.\n7. Buffalo Bills. The Bills are favored in every game of the 2025 season, meaning they should have plenty of positive game scripts to work with. After forcing 32 turnovers last season, there is no reason to believe a repeat isn't in store, especially since the Bills are no stranger to repeating history.\n8. Seattle Seahawks. This team is almost unrecognizable, resembling a group thrown together by the computer in the fifth season of a Madden franchise mode. Yet that is more on the offensive side of the ball as Mike Macdonald's team finished as DST6 in 2024. Having added even more pieces this offseason, things are looking up on young Macdonald's farm.\n9. New York Jets. The Jets defense took a step back in 2024, but should benefit from the return of Jermaine Johnson and the addition of Aaron Glenn as head coach. With a team that projects to run the ball and control the clock, their defense should be on the field a lot less in 2025 \u2013 creating an all-around more effective unit, even with the question mark that is their offense.\n10. Detroit Lions. Despite a lengthy list of injuries in 2024, the Lions still managed a DST10 finish to the season. With new coordinators on both sides of the ball, however, there are some concerns. The reinforcements on the way, especially the return of Aidan Hutchinson, should make the transition smoother though.\n11. Los Angeles Rams. The linebackers are an issue, but the Rams looked like a Super Bowl contender last season and have more than enough in the trenches to continue being a problem for the opposition.\n12. Green Bay Packers. There is no real weakness in this defense, but they were fairly reliant on turnovers for their fantasy production in 2024. While a team like the Bills worked to address their pass rush concerns, the Packers face the reality of playing in a tougher division with a less-dominant offense. They are still a worthy selection, but it doesn't come without its risks.\n13. New York Giants. Big Blue has sleeper potential in 2025, boasting a pass rush that promises to inflict pain and suffering on opposing quarterbacks with Brian Burns and Abdul Carter off the edge. Russell Wilson won't put them in a bad spot with costly turnovers either, boosting the floor for what could be a sneaky good defense. There's a real chance you can get this potential top-10 unit at a major discount.\n14. Los Angeles Chargers. Jesse Minter appears to be on the fast track to landing a head coaching job in the near future and it's all thanks to a solid defense. They'll need some progression from their young players in the secondary and production from Khalil Mack, but they can be on the rise throughout the season if things break right.\n15. Kansas City Chiefs. Another year older and plagued by a tough 2024 fantasy season, it's hard to get on the Chiefs' bandwagon when it comes to their DST in fantasy. Steve Spagnuolo has done a great job making Kansas City into a solid unit over the years, but there are better options out there.\n16. San Francisco 49ers. The return of Robert Saleh also brought some additional investments on defense. San Francisco spent five picks in the top 113 of the draft on defensive players and will look for a return to form in 2025.\n17. Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys are hoping for a bounce-back season after parting ways with Mike McCarthy. Former Bears coach Matt Eberflus wasn't effective in the big chair, but the hope is he can find some effectiveness again as a coordinator. Dallas has the pieces in place to continue forcing turnovers and generating pressure. Provided they figure out a deal with Micah Parsons, there's no reason they can't return to being a solid fantasy option again in 2025.\n18. Arizona Cardinals. A defensive-minded head coach, Jonathan Gannon had the privilege of investing six of seven picks for his unit through the draft. With improvement at all three levels and the signing of Josh Sweat, the Cardinals also feature a schedule with some good matchups early on. The narrative can change quickly for the redbirds.\n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n20. Cleveland Browns\n21. Washington Commanders\n22. New England Patriots\n23. Chicago Bears\n24. Atlanta Falcons\n25. Cincinnati Bengals\n27. New Orleans Saints\n28. Miami Dolphins\n29. Jacksonville Jaguars\n30. Las Vegas Raiders\n31. Tennessee Titans\n32. Carolina Panthers"

      "text": "Fantasy football TE rankings 2025: Bank on Brock Bowers, Trey McBride\nFantasy football draft season is upon us.\nWhile the focus is on running backs and wide receivers, selecting the best tight end in your league can be the ultimate difference maker in becoming a league winner.\nTight end is often considered a fantasy wasteland but several players can help put their stamp on a successful fantasy lineup.\nEntering last season, a clear-cut TE1 didn't exist but Raiders star Brock Bowers burst onto the scene and is firmly planted at the top of the rankings heading into 2025. As always, the Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce returns, and tight ends like Detroit's Sam LaPorta and Arizona's Trey McBride have emerged as high-end options.\nThere are only a few highly coveted tight ends but there are some gems you can select deeper down the draft board with league-winning potential.\nWho are the best fantasy football tight ends in 2025? Here's a look at USA TODAY's preseason fantasy TE rankings.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nFantasy football rankings: TE\n1. Brock Bowers, Las Vegas Raiders. Bowers delivered on high expectations in 2024. He set multiple rookie receiving records and is expected once again to be the top target in the Raiders offense. With improved quarterback play expected from Geno Smith under center, Bowers has little risk and a high floor.\n2. Trey McBride, Arizona Cardinals. The Cardinals tight end was arguably the best hurdler in the NFL in 2024 and he may have just enough juice to hurdle his way to finishing as TE1 in 2025. He led all tight ends with a league-high 25.9% target rate and had the second-most red-zone targets in the NFL. McBride's 111 receptions last season were the fourth most by a tight end in a single season all-time. He finished with just two touchdowns despite the massive target share, which suggests he should see positive regression in the touchdown column in 2025.\n3. George Kittle, San Francisco 49ers. With the 49ers battered by injuries last season, Kittle became a focal point and reminded everyone just how valuable he is. Heading into 2025, expect more of the same, with Brandon Aiyuk (knee) slowly making his return and Deebo Samuel traded to Washington. Over the last two seasons with Brock Purdy, Kittle posted an average depth of target (aDOT) of 9.9 and 8.9 -- significantly higher marks than Bowers (6.6 aDOT) and McBride (6.5 aDOT). Kittle has posted back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons and is one of the best red-zone threats, scoring 25 touchdowns over the last three seasons.\n4. Sam LaPorta, Detroit Lions. LaPorta didn't replicate his success from his rookie season when he finished as TE1, but he still has that same upside heading into his third NFL season. He finished as TE7 in point-per-reception (PPR) formats but dealt with multiple injuries throughout the season. Ben Johnson is no longer in Detroit calling plays, but there should be no shortage of offense to go around with the Lions, who scored an NFL-high 33.2 points per game last season.\n5. Travis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs. Kelce's production declined significantly in 2024, despite his target share (25%) holding firm. His yards per route run and yards after the catch both declined for the third consecutive season, but expectations remain high in the Chiefs offense. Rashee Rice could miss multiple games, which would open the door for the vet to become the focal point in the passing attack during that period. He finished as TE5 in 2024 and there's no reason to believe he can't repeat. He's no longer the elite fantasy player he was, but he remains inside the top 10 at the position and has a safe floor.\n6. David Njoku, Cleveland Browns. Njoku is in an offense with the biggest question mark at quarterback this preseason. It's nothing new for the Browns tight end, who has been able to find success despite the lack of consistency under center. Veteran Joe Flacco is the likely leader to start Week 1 and Njoku averaged 16.2 fantasy points per game with a 28% target share in six games with Flacco in 2023. Cleveland lacks viable receivers outside of Jerry Jeudy, which will allow Njoku to gobble up more looks.\n7. T.J. Hockenson, Minnesota Vikings. The former first-round pick will be over a year removed from an ACL injury. He's been extremely efficient since joining Kevin O'Connell's offense in Minnesota and will be catching passes from J.J. McCarthy in 2025. He finished 2023 second at the position in targets and receptions. Fully healthy entering 2025, he is a solid mid-range TE1.\n8. Kyle Pitts, Atlanta Falcons. Here's the first of two post-hype sleepers ranked inside the top 12. Pitts has been one of the most frustrating fantasy players to roster but with Michael Penix Jr. taking the reins in 2025, there is new hope. Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson enters his second season and should have a better idea of how to maximize Pitts' potential.\n9. Evan Engram, Denver Broncos. Engram finds himself in an exciting offense in Denver, where he has plenty of potential in Sean Payton's \"joker\" role. There's not much target competition aside from Courtland Sutton and he could easily see over 100 targets.\n10. Mark Andrews, Baltimore Ravens. Andrews is aging but has been a fantasy stalwart for seven seasons. He's been a consensus top-5 tight end for the last six seasons but saw his yards per route run drop for the third consecutive year. He averaged just 3.7 yards after the catch (YAC), which tied for 41st among tight ends. He has an incredible rapport with Lamar Jackson, but the emergence of Isaiah Likely could put a dent in his target share.\n11. Dalton Kincaid, Buffalo Bills. Kincaid is an excellent post-hype sleeper. Big things were expected from the 2023 first-round pick last season, but he dealt with injuries. The good? His target rate increased from 19.6% to 25.7%, which is around the average of a TE1. The tight end position has typically taken longer for players to break out, with LaPorta and Bowers being the outliers. In Year 3 of a Josh Allen-led offense, there's an opportunity for Kincaid to boom. He was second on the team in targets more than 15 yards downfield\n12. Jake Ferguson, Dallas Cowboys. Ferguson finds himself as the third option in the Cowboys passing attack entering 2025 after the addition of George Pickens. This will likely keep him firmly outside a top-five finish at the position, but he should have a safe floor week-to-week with Dak Prescott healthy. He ranked as TE12 in Prescott's eight healthy games in 2024.\n13. Chig Okonkwo, Tennessee Titans. The Titans offense has some intrigue with No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward expected to be under center in Week 1. Okonkwo has been inconsistent but it's easy to point the blame at poor quarterback play. Tennessee lacks a clear second receiver behind Calvin Ridley, and Okonkwo had a massive 27% target share down the stretch last season when given a full-time role. A young quarterback's best friend is often a tight end. He is a sneaky option who can be selected late in drafts.\n14. Tyler Warren, Indianapolis Colts. Of the rookie tight ends, Warren has the least target competition after landing with the Colts. Warren should excel in Shane Steichen's RPO-heavy offense, where he can do damage after the catch. Among rookie tight ends, he is the most likely to have a top-10 finish at the position.\n15. Tucker Kraft, Green Bay Packers. Kraft took a significant leap in his second season, finishing with over 700 yards and seven touchdowns. Green Bay has plenty of weapons and added another in the first round of the draft in WR Matthew Golden. Kraft earned just 15% of the team's targets last season and relied heavily on his abilities after the catch. That will likely keep him outside of the top 10.\n16. Isaiah Likely, Baltimore Ravens. Likely is just 25 years old and averaged 6.1 yards after the catch (tied for sixth among TEs) compared to Mark Andrews' 3.7. Todd Monken's offense continued to feature Andrews as the season progressed. Still, Likely posted career highs across the board. Andrews, who will be 30 this season, saw his yards per route run drop for the third consecutive season. Lamar Jackson posted a 131.2 passer rating when targeting Likely in 2024. There is legitimate TE1 upside if Andrews is injured or traded.\n17. Brenton Strange, Jacksonville Jaguars. The Jaguars offense should have a new identity in 2025 with Liam Coen in town. Trevor Lawrence previously supported Engram as an elite fantasy tight end, which gives hope that there's breakout potential for Strange. However, there are other weapons in the Jaguars offense (Brian Thomas Jr., Travis Hunter) he will have to compete with for targets.\n18. Mason Taylor, New York Jets. Taylor, a second-round draft pick, could easily find himself as the No. 2 weapon in the Jets air attack behind Garrett Wilson. The Jets offense, led by Justin Fields, will likely take a run-heavy approach. Still, new offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand was the passing game coordinator in Detroit while Sam LaPorta emerged, making Taylor an intriguing late-round option.\n19. Mike Gesicki, Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals' contract talks this offseason have been loud, but among the quietest deals to go down was the three-year, $25 million extension for Gesicki. Joe Burrow can support multiple receivers at a time and if the oft-injured Tee Higgins were to miss time during the year, the Penn State product would be firmly inside the top 10 at the position.\n20. Dallas Goedert, Philadelphia Eagles. Goedert has an upside that can't be matched, but is contingent on the health of DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown. He's often the fourth option in Philadelphia's offense but he still manages to average about 50 yards per year. He missed seven games last season with injuries and was the topic of trade rumors earlier in the offseason. He is a steady TE2 option.\n21. Colston Loveland, Chicago Bears. With Ben Johnson leading Chicago, the Bears offense is expected to take a significant leap. However, the presence of Cole Kmet, DJ Moore, Rome Odunze and Luther Burden will likely keep Loveland in the back end of TE2 range.\n22. Pat Freiermuth, Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers had the fourth-fewest pass attempts per game in 2024. More of the same can be expected with Arthur Smith still calling plays. The veteran tight end recorded a career-high 653 yards, 65 receptions and seven touchdowns in 2024. Freiermuth finished 2024 as TE9 in PPR but the addition of Jonnu Smith only increased his target competition.\n23. Zach Ertz, Washington Commanders. Ertz will turn 35 in November and is among the group of veterans ranked as a viable TE2. He was a significant piece of the upstart Commanders last season and finished as TE7 in PPR formats. Jayden Daniels looked for Ertz often but there's added target competition in 2025 with Deebo Samuel in the mix and 2024 second-rounder Ben Sinnott expected to earn a larger role.\n24. Jonnu Smith, Pittsburgh Steelers. Like his new teammate Freiermuth, Smith finds himself splitting looks in the Steelers' run-first offense. It will be difficult for the pair of vets to replicate their success from 2024 despite teaming up with Aaron Rodgers.\n25. Darren Waller, Miami Dolphins\n26. Hunter Henry, New England Patriots\n27. Juwan Johnson, New Orleans Saints\n28. Oronde Gadsden, Los Angeles Chargers\n29. Dalton Schultz, Houston Texans\n30. Elijah Arroyo, Seattle Seahawks\n31. Theo Johnson, New York Giants\n32. Cade Otton, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n33. Terrance Ferguson, Los Angeles Rams\n34. Ja'Tavion Sanders, Carolina Panthers\n35. Will Dissly, Los Angeles Chargers"

A good draft strategy and the right group of players are essential for building a winning team. And one of the most important, make-or-break positions to get right in a draft is wide receiver.\nUnfortunately, the position is also one that can feature high volatility from year to year. For instance, Miami Dolphins wideout Tyreek Hill led the league in receiving yards and touchdowns in 2023 then failed to surpass 1,000 receiving yards in 2024.\nBecause of that difficulty in projections and in honor of fantasy football ramping back up, USA TODAY Sports has ranked the top 50 wide receivers ahead of the 2025 fantasy football season.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nFantasy football rankings: WR\n1. Justin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings. Jefferson proved over the last two years that it doesn't matter who's throwing him the ball, he's going to put up big numbers.\n2. Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals. Chase won the receiving triple crown last year and got paid for it, but that was with Tee Higgins missing several games and the Bengals constantly playing from behind. The big yardage will still be there, but maybe not quite as many receptions and touchdowns.\n3. Puka Nacua, Los Angeles Rams. The Rams declared Nacua the new face of their air offense when they released former triple crown winner Cooper Kupp. Even with veteran Davante Adams joining the team, Sean McVay's offense will call for plenty of targets to the third-year standout.\n4. Malik Nabers, New York Giants. Nabers became the first Giants pass-catcher to surpass 800 receiving yards in a season since Odell Beckham Jr. in 2018. And he finished with more than 1,200 yards while catching passes from Daniel Jones, Tommy DeVito, Drew Lock and Tim Boyle.\n5. Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions. St. Brown has been a first-team All-Pro receiver each of the last two seasons, and there's no reason to believe his 1,000-yard streak will end after three consecutive years of outstanding production.\n6. Nico Collins, Houston Texans. Collins missed five games and still surpassed the 1,000-yard mark last year with an underperforming C.J. Stroud under center. His biggest competition for targets now that Stefon Diggs is gone is Christian Kirk.\n7. CeeDee Lamb, Dallas Cowboys. Lamb had his fourth straight 1,000-yard season last year despite a season-ending injury to quarterback Dak Prescott. But there are questions about how his production might shift with new head coach/offensive playcaller Brian Schottenheimer and incoming wide receiver George Pickens joining the fold.\n8. Brian Thomas Jr., Jacksonville Jaguars. Thomas led all rookie wide receivers last year with 1,282 receiving yards. The biggest question is how much target competition he'll have from rookie two-way player Travis Hunter, whom the Jaguars like as a receiver.\n9. Ladd McConkey, Los Angeles Chargers. After a middling start to the season, McConkey established himself as the Chargers' bona fide No. 1 receiver by the halfway point. He's a dangerous receiver at all three levels of the field.\n10. A.J. Brown, Philadelphia Eagles. Brown has been an outstanding addition to the Eagles' passing offense paired with quarterback Jalen Hurts. But will his production decline again in 2025 after last year's pivot to focusing on the run game?\n11. Tyreek Hill, Miami Dolphins. Hill had one of the worst seasons of his career in 2024, though it was one with some quarterback turmoil due to Tua Tagovailoa's various injuries. A bounce-back season in 2025 seems plausible.\n12. Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seattle Seahawks. The third-year receiver established himself as the top dog in Seattle's passing game last year. Now that D.K. Metcalf is in Pittsburgh, Smith-Njigba's top competition for targets is 32-year-old Cooper Kupp.\n13. Drake London, Atlanta Falcons. London broke out last year with his first season of 100 receptions and more than 1,000 receiving yards. Now that he'll be paired with young gunslinger Michael Penix Jr. for a full season, 2024's output could be his floor.\n14. Garrett Wilson, New York Jets. Wilson put up career-high numbers in receptions (101), yards (1,104) and touchdowns (7) last year and got rewarded with an extension. How will he fare in 2025 working with another new starting quarterback?\n15. Terry McLaurin, Washington Commanders. McLaurin had been the ultimate quarterback-proof receiver, and then the Commanders finally paired him with an excellent one in Jayden Daniels. The only reasons McLaurin isn't higher on this list are his ongoing contract negotiation standoff with the team and the Commanders' addition of Deebo Samuel to their receiving corps.\n16. Courtland Sutton, Denver Broncos. It's hard to call Sutton's 2024 season a breakout \u2013 he had previously made a Pro Bowl in 2019 \u2013 but it was something of a re-breakout in his first year with rookie quarterback Bo Nix.\n17. Tee Higgins, Cincinnati Bengals. Higgins has missed five games in each of the last two seasons. But with a new contract keeping him in Cincinnati with Chase and quarterback Joe Burrow, he'll maintain a high level of production in the Bengals passing game.\n18. Marvin Harrison Jr., Arizona Cardinals. Harrison didn't have the breakout rookie season many expected last year, though he still established himself as the top wideout on the Cardinals. He'll still be competing for targets with tight end Trey McBride.\n19. Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Evans is the NFL's Mr. Consistency. Through 11 seasons, he's never totaled fewer than 1,000 yards Last year, he was able to do it in 14 games while also scoring 11 touchdowns.\n20. D.J. Moore, Chicago Bears. Moore didn't have quite as excellent a season in 2024 as he did in 2023, but he no longer has to split targets with veteran Keenan Allen and now gets to work with an offensive guru head coach in Ben Johnson.\n21. Zay Flowers, Baltimore Ravens. Flowers became the first Pro Bowl wide receiver (to make it as a wide receiver, not return specialist) in Ravens history last year. He's back for Year 3 and is projected to once again be the top receiver for two-time MVP Lamar Jackson.\n22. Davante Adams, Los Angeles Rams. Even in his age-33 season, Adams will likely be a factor in a Sean McVay offense that has consistently featured a steady diet of passing.\n23. DK Metcalf, Pittsburgh Steelers. Metcalf projects to be the top receiver in a Pittsburgh passing attack led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers.\n24. DeVonta Smith, Philadelphia Eagles. Like his Eagles receiving partner A.J. Brown, Smith's production declined in 2024 as the Philadelphia offense started to lean on its run game. Smith still recorded more than 800 yards and set a career high with eight touchdowns.\n25. Tetairoa McMillan, Carolina Panthers. McMillan is the highest-ranked rookie on this list. He was the No. 8 overall pick in this year's draft and the highest-drafted receiver not named Travis Hunter. If Bryce Young is going to take another step forward in 2025, it will be with McMillan's help.\n26. Rashee Rice, Kansas City Chiefs. Rice is the top receiver in a passing offense led by the league's best quarterback, but off-field issues could mean he will face discipline from the NFL and miss some games.\n27. Calvin Ridley, Tennessee Titans. Ridley quietly had an excellent 2024 season, but he was missing a lot of the week-to-week consistency that's crucial in fantasy football. Maybe that will change with rookie quarterback and No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward starting under center.\n28. Chris Godwin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Godwin was on pace for a Ja'Marr Chase-like season when he suffered a brutal ankle injury in the final moments of a Week 7 game. He's still working his way back from the injury but should be a big part of Tampa Bay's offense in 2025.\n29. Travis Hunter, Jacksonville Jaguars. Hunter is something of a fantasy wild card. The Jaguars have played him more at wide receiver during offseason workouts, but he could end up playing some snaps at cornerback as well. He has game-changing potential at either position, but it's unclear how his talent will translate at the pro level.\n30. Jauan Jennings, San Francisco 49ers. Jennings recently demanded an extension or trade from the 49ers, but he flashed No. 1 receiver potential in 2024.\n31. Jordan Addison, Minnesota Vikings. Addison was a consistent producer with boom potential throughout the 2024 season, even as the Vikings' No. 2 receiver. (Update: Addison has been suspended for the first three games of the regular season.)\n32. Jakobi Meyers, Las Vegas Raiders. Meyers won't get the same attention as second-year tight end Brock Bowers and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty, but with a new quarterback in Geno Smith, Meyers could have another solid outing in 2025.\n33. Jaylen Waddle, Miami Dolphins. Similar to Hill, Waddle's fantasy production could rely heavily on the health of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, but the ceiling is high.\n34. Jameson Williams, Detroit Lions. Williams had a breakout year in 2024 but was something of a boom-or-bust fantasy scorer. There is real potential here as a high-ceiling FLEX player.\n35. Jerry Jeudy, Cleveland Browns. Who will be Jeudy's quarterback in 2025? The answer to that question may determine Jeudy's fantasy viability after his first Pro Bowl season last year.\n36. Chris Olave, New Orleans Saints. Olave's injury issues have so far held him back from reaching his potential at the NFL level. There's also plenty of uncertainty with the Saints' quarterback situation.\n37. Xavier Worthy, Kansas City Chiefs. The speedy receiver played in all 17 games last year but didn't record more than 80 yards in a game. Still, he was second on the team in targets behind tight end Travis Kelce.\n38. George Pickens, Dallas Cowboys. Pickens' fantasy viability will depend heavily on how new Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer deploys him alongside incumbent No. 1 CeeDee Lamb.\n39. Deebo Samuel Sr., Washington Commanders. Samuel hasn't come close to the 2021 season he had featuring 1,770 scrimmage yards before or since. But he has provided somewhat consistent production as both a receiver and rusher. How the Commanders plan to use him in their offense remains to be seen, but pairing him with Daniels gives him high yards-after-catch potential.\n40. Khalil Shakir, Buffalo Bills. Shakir led the Bills in targets, receptions and receiving yards despite a crowded room of pass-catchers \u2013 14 different Bills players recorded at least one catch in 2024.\n41. Brandon Aiyuk, San Francisco 49ers. Aiyuk should be the No. 1 receiver in the 49ers' passing offense when he returns. It's those last three words \u2013 when he returns \u2013 that are key to knowing his full fantasy potential.\n42. Stefon Diggs, New England Patriots. Diggs could be the top receiver in a rising Patriots offense led by second-year quarterback Drake Maye.\n43. Rome Odunze, Chicago Bears. Odunze showed a lot to like as a rookie working with fellow rookie (and quarterback) Caleb Williams in 2024. An extra year with Williams and a partnership with head coach Ben Johnson boosts his ceiling for 2025.\n44. Matthew Golden, Green Bay Packers. Golden was the first wide receiver the Packers have drafted in the first round since 2002. Green Bay probably didn't make the move without a belief he has leading receiver potential for young gunslinger Jordan Love.\n45. Cooper Kupp, Seattle Seahawks. Kupp hasn't been anything close to the triple crown-winning version of himself since that 2021 season, but he's an important addition to a Seahawks offense that needed a new No. 2 receiver after Metcalf's departure.\n46. Josh Downs, Indianapolis Colts. Who will Downs' quarterback be in 2025? Despite turmoil at the position last year, Downs still put together a solid 2024 season, so the answer to that question may not matter all too much.\n47. Christian Kirk, Houston Texans. Kirk landed in Houston after a trade away from Jacksonville, where his production had slowed after an excellent first season in Duval County. He'll be partly reliant on a bounce-back season from quarterback C.J. Stroud.\n48. Keon Coleman, Buffalo Bills. Where Shakir seemed to establish himself as the Bills' new No. 1 receiver last year, Coleman did enough to inspire belief that he can also be among the top producers in that offense going forward.\n49. Emeka Egbuka, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite quarterback Baker Mayfield playing under a different offensive coordinator each year he's been in Tampa Bay, a common thread has been the Bucs' willingness to throw the football. Egbuka has high-target potential as the Bucs' slot guy as a rookie.\n50. Rashod Bateman, Baltimore Ravens. Bateman just signed a three-year extension with the Ravens after his career-best season in 2024. His 756 receiving yards and nine touchdowns were both career highs, and the extension indicates Baltimore still has plans for him."

      "text": "Fantasy football kicker rankings 2025: Target Brandon Aubrey, Jake Bates\nKicker is a polarizing position in fantasy football. Some leagues have eliminated them altogether because of the seemingly random nature of the position's top scorers each week.\nOther leagues embrace the unpredictability provided by kickers. They still include them in their rosters, which forces fantasy football managers to seek out the most consistent options at the position.\nThe formula for finding a quality kicker is fairly simple. Fantasy managers typically search for players with a combination of great accuracy and power. It also helps to identify which kickers play for offenses that create the most scoring opportunities, as volume is part of the equation at kicker.\nWhich kickers best fit that profile for the 2025 NFL season? USA TODAY Sports breaks down the best, starting with a player who has been a top-two fantasy kicker in each of his first two NFL seasons.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nFantasy football rankings: Kicker\n1. Brandon Aubrey, Dallas Cowboys. Aubrey has one of the biggest legs in the NFL and has made 24 of 27 career field goals from 50-plus yards. As long as he maintains that accuracy, he will be the perennial No. 1 fantasy kicker.\n2. Jake Bates, Detroit Lions. Like Aubrey, Bates is a big-legged former soccer player who kicked in the UFL before coming to the NFL. The Lions have one of the best offenses in the league but could stall out in field goal range more often in 2025 after losing OC Ben Johnson during the offseason.\n3. Cameron Dicker, Los Angeles Chargers. \"Dicker the Kicker\" has averaged 2.16 field goal attempts per game with the Chargers and has made 93.8% of those kicks. Consider him one of the safest picks at the position.\n4. Chase McLaughlin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. McLaughlin has made at least 29 field goals in three consecutive seasons and plays for a high-powered Buccaneers offense. He should continue to get a lot of opportunities in warm-weather Tampa.\n5. Chris Boswell, Pittsburgh Steelers. Boswell made a league-leading 41 field goals last season, including 13 attempts from 50-plus yards. He should continue to be a high-volume kicker, even if Aaron Rodgers finds success and eats into his opportunities.\n6. Tyler Bass, Buffalo Bills. Bass may deal with some bad weather late in the season in Buffalo, but he has a big leg and has attempted at least 50 extra points in all five of his NFL seasons. He plays for one of the league's best offenses and should have no shortage of scoring opportunities.\n7. Matt Gay, Washington Commanders. Commanders kickers combined to attempt 42 field goals last season and 47 extra points. If Gay can maintain his 85.5% career field goal percentage, he could end up being a top-five fantasy kicker.\n8. Harrison Butker, Kansas City Chiefs. Butker has missed eight games over the last three seasons but has still averaged 33.2 field goal attempts per 17 games played over that span. As long as he and Patrick Mahomes are healthy, the Chiefs will provide Butker with plenty of scoring opportunities.\n9. Wil Lutz, Denver Broncos. Lutz gets to kick in Denver's thin air and has made 89.7% of his field goals with the Broncos. He has only once failed to attempt 30 field goals during his eight NFL seasons, so consider him a high-floor kicker with great home scoring upside.\n10. Ka'imi Fairbairn, Houston Texans. Fairbairn attempted 16 field goals from 50-plus yards last season and made 13 of them. He never attempted more than six from that range in his previous seven campaigns, but his mix of power and accuracy makes him worth drafting.\n11. Jake Elliott, Philadelphia Eagles. Elliott went just 1 of 7 on field goals from 50-plus yards last season. He had previously made 70.2% of his career kicks from that range, so positive regression and a wealth of opportunities in Philadelphia's high-powered offense make him a great bounce-back candidate.\n12. Evan McPherson, Cincinnati Bengals. Speaking of bounce-back candidates, the Bengals were one of the NFL's most prolific offenses last season, averaging 27.8 points per game. McPherson should be a consistent scorer if he can stay healthy after missing five games last season and improve upon his career-worst 72.7% field goal percentage.\n13. Jason Sanders, Miami Dolphins. Sanders attempted 41 field goals last season and made 12 of 14 from 50-plus yards. His accuracy and consistency could make him a weekly starter, provided Tua Tagovailoa can stay healthy.\n14. Younghoe Koo, Atlanta Falcons. Koo made just 73.5% of his field goals last season but averaged 32 made field goals per season over his previous four. He kicks in a dome, which makes him a solid, weatherproof option for half the season.\n15. Cairo Santos, Chicago Bears. Ben Johnson's arrival in Chicago could provide Santos a boost. The ever-accurate kicker has made 89.3% of his field goals in five seasons with the Bears and could be a reliable fantasy producer with an uptick in opportunities.\n16. Brandon McManus, Green Bay Packers. McManus made 50 of his 51 kicks for the Packers last season (20 of 21 on field goals, 30 of 30 on extra points). His accuracy should make him a great streamer, though kicking at Lambeau Field could be problematic when the weather gets cold.\n17. Daniel Carlson, Las Vegas Raiders\n18. Jason Myers, Seattle Seahawks\n19. Will Reichard, Minnesota Vikings\n20. Joshua Karty, Los Angeles Rams\n21. Tyler Loop, Baltimore Ravens. Loop has upside, but trusting a rookie kicker is always a tough proposition, even if he is being coached by John Harbaugh.\n22. Harrison Mevis, New York Jets. Mevis is the latest member of the UFL-to-NFL kicker pipeline. Like Aubrey and Bates, Mevis has a big leg and was accurate during the previous spring-league season. He is worth monitoring and profiles as a solid sleeper \u2013 provided he can beat recently-signed veteran Nick Folk for New York's kicker job.\n23. Chad Ryland, Arizona Cardinals\n24. Jake Moody, San Francisco 49ers\n25. Dustin Hopkins, Cleveland Browns\n26. Cam Little, Jacksonville Jaguars\n27. Joey Slye, Tennessee Titans\n28. Blake Grupe, New Orleans Saints\n29. Matthew Wright, Carolina Panthers\n30. Spencer Shrader, Indianapolis Colts\n31. Andy Borregales, New England Patriots\n32. Graham Gano, New York Giants"

      "text": "Fantasy football draft strategy: Drafting from No. 1 pick in 10-team full PPR\nWhen you secure the No. 1 overall pick in any fantasy football league, the first thing that comes to mind is \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\nThe first pick typically requires minimal thought. For example, look back to 2024. The consensus No. 1 pick was Christian McCaffrey, and that didn't turn out well. Things can go sideways in a hurry if that pick ends up injured early on.\nTo that end, when you find yourself basking in the glory of owning the right to select any player in the NFL to lead your fantasy squad, it's critical to make the right choice.\nAssuming it's a typical \"snake draft\" \u2013 meaning you pick first in Round 1 and last in Round 2, also referred to as \"the turn\" \u2013 waiting 18 picks to make your next selection doesn\u2019t seem so simple. Nevertheless, having the first pick is an advantage and it\u2019s essential to look ahead when picking at the turn.\nSo, let\u2019s build a roster starting with selection 1.01 and explore how you should approach the draft:\nFantasy football 2025: Picking No. 1 overall in PPR\nRound 1\nThe approach with the first overall pick this year is simple, as two obvious choices exist: Falcons running back Bijan Robinson and Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase. An argument can be made for Saquon Barkley but regression is on the horizon if history is any indication.\nNo player in NFL history has ever rushed for 2,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, and the \"Tush Push\" allows Jalen Hurts to continue to vulture goal-line touchdowns. Barkley had 482 touches combined in the regular season and playoffs, potentially suggesting less volume in 2025.\nDating back to 1998, Eddie George is the only player to have back-to-back seasons of 480-plus touches.\nThere's more leniency at the running back position in 10-team leagues but the preferred pick is Robinson at 1.01. The Falcons back should be in an improved offensive environment with Michael Penix Jr. at the helm and Robinson possesses unique abilities as a receiver, reeling in 119 receptions over the last two seasons (third most among RBs).\nHe posted an elite 21.3 opportunities (carries + targets) per game in 2024 while earning top-five grades for his position both as a runner and a receiver, per PFF.\nRounds 2/3: Commit to a plan\nYou may be tempted to pick one of the top quarterbacks in this spot, but in a 10-team league, there will be plenty of value at the position later in the draft. Select the best running back available to pair with Robinson and go into the season with more confidence than your league mates at the most challenging position to navigate.\nBy the time you pick again in Round 4, the running back position will lack surefire options. Create the safety net now and stick to the plan.\nIn the case of our mock draft, Chase Brown was selected. Veterans like Jonathan Taylor, Kyren Williams and Josh Jacobs also make fine selections here, and all were available at the turn.\nNext, land the best wide receiver available. The top 10 players at the position are likely off the board, but several players who are top options on their team should be available. Guys like Terry McLaurin, Ladd McConkey or Garrett Wilson make fine selections.\nRounds 4/5: Land a staple\nThe optimal draft strategy should have you positioned comfortably with two top RBs and a WR by this point. This approach in the first three rounds affords you the luxury of snagging one of the top three tight ends if they are available: Brock Bowers and Trey McBride were off the board but George Kittle\nIn the USA TODAY fantasy football mock draft, Kittle was available in this spot. The 49ers' tight end landed a massive extension this summer as a result of his consistent performance. He's finished as a top-five fantasy TE in six of the past seven seasons. With Deebo Samuel traded and Brandon Aiyuk recovering from a knee injury, Kittle can easily outperform his ADP.\nIn case the top three tight ends aren't available, the best course of action is to select the best remaining of the top four quarterbacks: Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Jayden Daniels and Jalen Hurts. The goal is to draft a TE or QB staple.\nWith the first pick of the fifth round, select the best player available: RB or WR.\nMiddle rounds: Build a contender\nThe approach to the middle and late rounds requires the same focus and execution you had early on.\nContinue to fill out your team with the best RBs and WRs available. Typically, the league will have a \"FLEX' spot for your lineup and those positions are best suited to fill your team. There is no need for a second TE if you landed one of the top options.\nWait until the ninth or 10th round if you missed out on the top QBs. There's no harm in being the last team to pick a QB, especially in a 10-team format. The law of supply and demand suggests it will pay dividends to fill your roster with more options at RB. There are many QBs you can trust, and holding more cards at RB could be the difference in winning a fantasy championship.\nLate rounds\nLook for situations with uncertainty on the depth chart. Usually, it's where a rookie could stake his claim, but there are scenarios like the one in Buffalo this offseason with James Cook, who is searching for a contract extension. This could open the door for Ray Davis; the upside of Davis taking the majority of the snaps in a Josh Allen-led offense should not be ignored.\nContinue to search for shaky depth charts. The Broncos and Chargers are fine examples. Denver drafted RJ Harvey in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft and then signed J.K. Dobbins. Los Angeles selected Omarion Hampton in the first round but had signed Najee Harris beforehand in free agency. All four running backs would be worthy of consideration in the middle to late rounds.\nAlways wait to pick your defense. If your league has kickers, use your last pick for a sleeper instead. Add a kicker to your roster the day before Week 1, as kickers score in the same range and don't provide an edge.\nMock draft results from No. 1 pick\n- 1.01: Bijan Robinson, ATL (RB1)\n- 2.10: Chase Brown, CIN (RB9)\n- 3.01: Tee Higgins, CIN (WR12)\n- 4.10: George Kittle, SF (TE3)\n- 5.01: DK Metcalf, PIT (WR20)\n- 6.10: Chris Godwin, TB (WR25)\n- 7.01: TreVeyon Henderson, NE (RB24)\n- 8.10: George Pickens, DAL (WR37)\n- 9.01: Tetairoa McMillan, NE (WR38)\n- 10.10: Kyler Murray, AZ (QB9)\n- 11.01: Deebo Samuel, WASH (WR46)\n- 12.10: Ray Davis, BUF (RB43)\n- 13.01: Najee Harris, LAC (RB44)\n- 14.10: Texans D/ST (DST5)\n- 15.01: Chase McLaughlin, TB (K6)"

      "text": "Fantasy football QB rankings: Does Josh Allen or Lamar Jackson top position?\nQuarterbacks may not carry the same value in fantasy football as they do in real life, but it's still important for owners to find the right fit at the position.\nIncreasingly, quarterbacks are moving up fantasy draft boards. Top signal-callers in 2025 are seeing their average draft position (ADP) climb into the low-20s, putting a handful in the second- and third-round range of draft boards.\nThe age-old question for fantasy owners is whether to take a top-tier quarterback early or wait until the middle rounds to address the position. Is it better to pay the piper for Josh Allen, or can you load up on running backs and receivers while targeting a high-upside mid-rounder like Dak Prescott or Justin Fields?\nEach owner will decide on their draft strategy, but their respective goals will be identical: to land either a high-volume passer or a dual-threat quarterback who can be a lineup anchor for a championship fantasy team.\nWho are the best fantasy football quarterbacks in 2025? Here's a look at USA TODAY's preseason fantasy QB rankings.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nFantasy football rankings: QB\n1. Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills. The Bills generated 6,105 total yards and 62 offensive touchdowns during the 2024 NFL season. Allen was responsible for 4,262 of those yards (69.8%) and 40 of those touchdowns (64.5%). He should continue to be the driving force behind Buffalo's offense in 2025 and could end up leading quarterbacks in rushing touchdowns.\n2. Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens. Jackson outproduced Allen in terms of total yardage (5,087) and touchdowns (45) last season. He could do so again in 2025, but he finds himself just behind the Bills signal-caller because of Derrick Henry's presence. Jackson had just four rushing scores last season because of the bruising back's presence.\n3. Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals. Burrow led the NFL in pass attempts, completions, passing yards and passing touchdowns in 2024, a season during which Cincinnati often played from behind thanks to a leaky defense. The Bengals didn't markedly improve that side of the ball during the offseason, so Burrow should once again be asked to serve as a high-volume passer in an offense featuring one of the best one-two receiver punches (Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins) in the NFL.\n4. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles. As long as the \"Tush Push\" remains legal, Hurts will have a clear path to leading quarterbacks in rushing touchdowns. That gives him as high a floor as any signal-caller, even playing for a Philadelphia offense that ranked dead-last in pass attempts per game last season (25.7).\n5. Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders. Daniels was electric as a rookie, throwing for 3,568 yards, 25 touchdowns and nine interceptions while adding an impressive 891 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground. His combination of mobility and arm talent could eventually make him the No. 1 fantasy quarterback, but fantasy owners will want to see the second-year pro avoid a sophomore slump before tiering him with the likes of Allen and Jackson.\n6. Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes is becoming a bit Tom Brady-like in that he might be a better real-life quarterback than a fantasy asset. Still, Mahomes has logged multiple seasons of 5,000-plus passing yards and 40-plus passing touchdowns, giving him a great ceiling. His averages of 4,403 yards and 27.5 total touchdowns over the last two seasons haven't been bad either.\n7. Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys. Is this a little high for Prescott? Maybe, but Dallas had the third-worst rushing offense in the league last season in terms of EPA per play (-0.12) and didn't discernibly upgrade its talent at the running back position. Prescott could end up being a high-volume passer as a result and will now work with George Pickens at receiver in addition to CeeDee Lamb. So long as his hamstring is back to full strength, Prescott should have a big year.\n8. Baker Mayfield, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Mayfield is set to work with yet another new offensive coordinator in 2025. He handled the transition from Dave Canales to Liam Coen with ease and hopes to enjoy the same success with Josh Grizzard. Mayfield once again gets to work with a loaded receiving corps, highlighted by Mike Evans, and will look to log a third consecutive 4,000-yard season for the Buccaneers.\n9. Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals. Murray started all 17 of Arizona's games last season and posted his best numbers since 2020, the last season during which he didn't miss time due to injury. If he continues to increase his rushing attempts as he gets further removed from his 2022 ACL injury, he should be able to cement himself as a top-10 fantasy quarterback.\n10. Bo Nix, Denver Broncos. Nix averaged 258.1 passing yards, 2.7 passing touchdowns, 0.9 interceptions and 20 rushing yards across the final seven games of his rookie regular season. If the second-year pro can continue producing at that clip as he continues to acclimate to the NFL, he should end up being a solid, do-it-all fantasy starter akin to Brock Purdy.\n11. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers. Speaking of Purdy, he and Nix should be neck-and-neck in any fantasy rankings. The 49ers signal-caller may not be overly exciting for fantasy owners, but after averaging 29 total touchdowns across the last two seasons, he is a steady starting option. The only question is whether he can continue to thrive with Brandon Aiyuk injured and Deebo Samuel gone.\n12. Justin Fields, New York Jets. Fields racked up five rushing touchdowns (10 total) across his six starts with the Steelers last season and is one of just three quarterbacks in NFL history, along with Lamar Jackson and Michael Vick, to rush for 1,000-plus yards in a season. Fields has never thrown for more than 17 touchdowns in a single season, but his rushing upside should make him a strong streamer as long as he's starting.\n13. Jared Goff, Detroit Lions. Goff has posted three consecutive seasons with at least 4,438 yards and had a career-best 37 passing touchdowns last season. However, the Lions lost offensive coordinator Ben Johnson to the Bears during the offseason, which has cast some doubt about whether Goff can continue his success.\n14. Jordan Love, Green Bay Packers. Love didn't take the big leap forward many fantasy owners had hoped for during the 2025 season. He ranked just 17th in fantasy points per game (FPPG) while struggling through an early-season MCL sprain. The big-armed quarterback is still just 26 and could jump into the starter ranks with a healthy season.\n15. Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers. Herbert was efficient for the Chargers last season, racking up 3,870 yards, 23 touchdowns and just three interceptions in his first year under Jim Harbaugh's tutelage. That said, Herbert isn't likely to be a high-volume passer since Los Angeles wants to utilize a run-heavy approach under Greg Roman. The team had the 10th-highest run play percentage last season and may see that rise again after it added Najee Harris and Omarion Hampton during the offseason.\n16. Caleb Williams, Chicago Bears. Williams is emerging as a sleeper darling as he prepares for his first season in Ben Johnson's offense. Johnson led Jared Goff to three consecutive seasons as a top-10 fantasy quarterback. He could do the same with Williams, especially if the second-year pro can improve behind an upgraded offensive line.\n17. Drake Maye, New England Patriots. Maye completed 66.6% of his passes for 2,276 yards, 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions as a rookie despite having one of the league's worst receiver rooms. The presence of Stefon Diggs and new offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels should give Maye significant upside, especially after he ran for 421 yards on a 7.8 yards per carry average last season.\n18. C.J. Stroud, Houston Texans. Stroud did not take the step forward many were hoping for in his second season, totaling just 20 touchdowns across 17 starts. He remains a quality matchup-based streamer with low-end QB1 upside for the whole season, but it could take him time to hit his stride behind Houston's remodeled offensive line and receiving corps.\n19. Tua Tagovailoa, Miami Dolphins. Tagovailoa is a hyper-efficient passer who led the NFL with a 72.9% completion rate last season, but he has a lengthy injury history. Miami's explosive playmakers will make him a viable starter most weeks he is healthy, but he has started more than 13 games just once during his career.\n20. Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars. Lawrence made just 10 starts last season and threw a career-low 11 touchdown passes. He posted consecutive 4,000-yard seasons in the previous two campaigns and could bounce back in Liam Coen's offense.\n21. Matthew Stafford, Los Angeles Rams. Stafford made 16 starts for the Rams last season. He recorded multiple touchdowns in just six of those games. Perhaps that will change with Davante Adams in tow, but Stafford looks more like a solid QB2 than a true fantasy starter at this stage in his career.\n22. Aaron Rodgers, Pittsburgh Steelers. Since the start of the 2022 NFL season, Rodgers has thrown for more than 300 yards in a game just once. That will limit the 41-year-old's fantasy upside in a Pittsburgh offense that had the fifth-highest run-play percentage (48.31%) in the NFL last season.\n23. Geno Smith, Las Vegas Raiders. Smith ranked fourth in the league last season in passing attempts (578), yet ranked just 17th in FPPG. That was largely thanks to his 3.6% touchdown percentage, which ranked 30th among 36 qualifiers for the stat. Playing in what figures to be a run-heavy offense under Pete Carroll in Las Vegas may further limit Smith's upside.\n24. Anthony Richardson, Indianapolis Colts. Richardson's rushing upside makes him a potential boom pick, as he has averaged 42.3 rushing yards over 15 career starts with 10 rushing touchdowns. But Richardson could bust just as easily after completing a league-worst 47.7% of his passes last season and struggling with injury. He should probably be left to the waiver wire outside of SuperFlex leagues.\n25. J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings. Kevin O'Connell just extracted a career-best season out of Sam Darnold, who proved to be a strong fantasy quarterback. Could he do the same with McCarthy? The 2024 first-round pick looked good in limited preseason action last year but is coming off multiple knee surgeries. Minnesota may begin the year as a more ground-dominant offense to ease McCarthy into NFL action.\n26. Bryce Young, Carolina Panthers. The main draw for Young is his solid mobility, as he had six rushing touchdowns in 12 starts last season. That said, he only averaged 20.1 rushing yards per start. That, plus his modest passing numbers, won't give him enough of a ceiling to start in fantasy most weeks.\n27. Cam Ward, Tennessee Titans. Ward figures to win the Titans job out of the chute with Will Levis out for the season. The 2025 NFL Draft's No. 1 pick will have Calvin Ridley at his disposal, but that may not be enough to make him fantasy-relevant in the early stages of his career.\n28. Sam Darnold, Seattle Seahawks. Darnold's average time to throw last season was 3.08 seconds, good for the third-longest in the NFL behind only Lamar Jackson (3.14) and Jalen Hurts (3.13). That won't play as well behind a Seattle line that only gave Geno Smith an average of 2.4 seconds of pocket time last season.\n29. Michael Penix Jr., Atlanta Falcons. Penix improved across each of his three starts last season and plays in an offense with plenty of weapons. But with Kirk Cousins lurking on the sidelines, Penix will have little room for error as a starter. The Falcons may also lean on Bijan Robinson in the red-zone, which could limit Penix's touchdown upside.\n30. Russell Wilson, New York Giants. Wilson was a viable streamer at times with the Steelers but also had his share of fantasy clunkers. It's hard to imagine him finding a lot of consistent success in New York, even with a top target like Malik Nabers at his disposal.\n31. Joe Flacco, Cleveland Browns. Flacco has made 11 starts over the last two seasons, totaling 3,377 yards, 25 touchdowns and 15 interceptions across those contests. His gunslinger mentality could make him a decent stream on occasion, but the 40-year-old may not win Cleveland's wide-open quarterback competition.\n32. Tyler Shough, New Orleans Saints. Shough, a second-round rookie, is in line to start for the Saints. The 25-year-old rookie has seven years of college experience but will have a tough task posting strong results in an aging New Orleans offense.\n33. Kirk Cousins, Atlanta Falcons. Cousins' track record as a solid NFL quarterback gives him the best chance among backup quarterbacks to get on the field. He struggled at times last season, his first in Atlanta, but had a couple of four-touchdown games when healthy.\n34. Jameis Winston, New York Giants. Winston throws a lot of interceptions, but he also makes a lot of explosive plays. He could end up being a matchup-based streamer if he supplants Wilson as the Giants' starter.\n35. Kenny Pickett, Cleveland Browns. Pickett could end up starting over Flacco if he beats the 40-year-old in Cleveland's wide-open quarterback competition. Either way, this is a situation fantasy owners will want to avoid."

      "text": "Fantasy football burning questions: Analyzing the AFC North\nAll 32 NFL teams are preparing to open their training camps in preparation for the 2025 season. This means fantasy football drafts are on the horizon.\nThe team at USA TODAY Sports is conducting a virtual tour of each division in preparation for the upcoming draft season. This will highlight the most critical issues or questions that impact fantasy football for every team.\nWhile mock drafts are a helpful tool this time of year, sometimes gathering information on position battles and depth charts can be just as useful.\nWhether it's a new arrival or departure that opens the door for an important position battle or a potential breakout, we have the fantasy insights to help shape your draft strategy.\nIt's never too early to start preparing for the fantasy football season. In this edition, we take a closer look at the AFC North.\nFANTASY PREVIEWS: NFC North | AFC North | NFC East | AFC East | AFC South | NFC South | NFC West | AFC West\nBaltimore Ravens (12-5)\nWill Todd Monken and the offense begin to lean on Isaiah Likely over Mark Andrews?\nTight end Mark Andrews has been a fantasy stalwart for seven seasons, but fantasy owners will remember his slow start and gut-wrenching finish in 2024.\nHe has been a consensus top-5 tight end for the last six seasons but finds himself ranked ninth overall at the position. This could be due to the emergence of Isaiah Likely, who posted career-highs across the board in 2024. Andrews, who will be 30 this season, saw his yards per route run drop for the third consecutive year.\nLikely is just 25 years old and averaged 6.1 yards after the catch (tied for sixth among TEs) compared to Andrews\u2019 3.7, which was tied for 41st. Likely amassed 111 yards on nine catches and a touchdown in Week 1 against the Chiefs last year, displaying his abilities, but Todd Monken's offense still featured Andrews as the season progressed.\nWhile speaking to the media at OTAs, head coach John Harbaugh said he's setting a goal for Likely to be an All-Pro by the end of the 2025 season.\n\"I want to see [Likely] be an All-Pro. That would be my goal for him, and he's capable of it.\"\nA strong connection was established with two-time MVP Lamar Jackson, as he posted a 131.2 passer rating when targeting Likely in 2024. There is legitimate TE1 upside if Andrews were to be phased out or even traded.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Derrick Henry (RB7, overall: 21)\n- Lamar Jackson (QB2, overall: 25)\n- Zay Flowers (WR25, overall: 50)\n- Mark Andrews (TE9, overall: 90)\n- Rashod Bateman (WR57, overall: 62)\n- Isaiah Likely (TE22)\nPittsburgh Steelers (10-7)\nWill DK Metcalf deliver a top-10 finish among WRs?\nIn 2024, Garrett Wilson finished as WR10 in PPR (points per reception) formats, and Davante Adams was on pace for a top-10 finish at the position, posting 854 yards and seven TDs in just 11 games alongside Aaron Rodgers in New York.\nPittsburgh acquired DK Metcalf in a trade from Seattle earlier in the offseason and is poised to receive the lion's share of targets in the new-look Steelers offense.\nMetcalf leads the NFL with 96 end-zone targets since entering the league and brings rare physical traits to the field.\nHe's finished between 967 and 1,114 yards in the past four seasons. His best season was in 2020, when he finished as the 10th overall wide receiver in fantasy points per game. He hasn't demanded an elite target share, but perhaps Rodgers can unlock some of the promise he displayed during the 2020 season.\nAdams and Rodgers had one of the best connections in NFL history. In 2020, Adams led the league with 18 touchdowns and 98.1 receiving yards per game in arguably the best season of the pairing. It's unlikely Metcalf can replicate those numbers in the Steelers' run-first environment, but he's capable of finishing inside the top 10 at the position.\nThey'll have a full training camp to get on the same page. As things currently stand, there's little target competition in the receiver room. George Pickens was traded to the Dallas Cowboys. Calvin Austin, Robert Woods and Roman Wilson will compete for snaps and targets but the Steelers lack a true No. 2 option. They may add another veteran to the room as the offseason progresses but Metcalf is primed for the highest target share of his career.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- DK Metcalf (WR24, overall: 47)\n- Kaleb Johnson (RB28, overall: 81)\n- Jaylen Warren (RB30, overall: 87)\n- Jonnu Smith (TE15)\n- Pat Freiermuth (TE20)\n- Aaron Rodgers (QB28)\nCincinnati Bengals (9-8)\nIs Chase Brown a breakout candidate?\nEveryone is aware of Bengals' receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, but Chase Brown is a sneaky option in the offense who burst onto the scene in the second half of 2024. He's currently being drafted as the ninth overall running back and could be a massive steal in drafts.\nCincinnati's offense is set up to score points at a high clip again (27.8 points per game in 2024) with Joe Burrow leading the way. All of those points can't come through the air.\nBrown took on a massive role, playing an elite 85% of snaps from Week 9 on and averaged 20.6 fantasy points per game (RB4 in PPR in that span). In his last eight games, Brown averaged 116.25 scrimmage yards, projecting to 1,976 over 17 games, which would have ranked third in the NFL last year.\nThe Bengals have veterans Zack Moss and Samaje Perine, but it's more likely they fill a change-of-pace back role. Cincinnati drafted sixth-rounder Tahj Brooks, signaling they are expecting Brown to carry the load in 2025.\nBrown has the pedigree to be an elite back. He led all RBs in the vertical jump, broad jump and bench press at the 2023 NFL Combine. He's at a prime age (25) at the RB position and even displayed elite receiving abilities (54 receptions on 65 targets) in 2024.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Ja'Marr Chase (WR1, overall: 1)\n- Tee Higgins (WR14, overall: 24)\n- Chase Brown (RB9, overall: 29)\n- Joe Burrow (QB5, overall: 48)\n- Mike Gesicki (TE21)\nCleveland Browns (3-14)\nDoes it matter who's playing QB for Jerry Jeudy?\nThe Browns' offense has question marks all over it. There's a massive quarterback competition heading into training camp between Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. Cleveland's second-round pick, running back Quinshon Judkins was arrested on July 12. The receiver room consists of Jerry Jeudy, Cedric Tillman and much-maligned Diontae Johnson.\nThe lack of depth at receiver is concerning, but this means the door is wide open again for Jeudy to build off of his 2024 success (WR12 in PPR). The uncertainty at QB is leading Jeudy to fall in drafts.\nJeudy posted 1,229 receiving yards last year and after Cleveland traded Amari Cooper in Week 7, he had 981 of those yards on 109 targets in 11 games. The Browns are expected to play from behind often, which will lead to more passing opportunities, as the game script suggests when trailing. Volume is king and Jeudy is set up for another massive target share in 2025 (145 targets \u2013 seventh among WRs in 2024).\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Jerry Jeudy (WR33, overall: 67)\n- Quinshon Judkins (RB29, overall: 83)\n- David Njoku (TE8, overall: 86)\n- Cedric Tillman (WR56)"

      "text": "Fantasy football top 200 overall players for the 2025 season\nAugust is an important month in fantasy football. Maybe the most important month.\nIt's when position battles take place during training camp. When exhibition games get teams out on the field against each other. It's also when injuries, unfortunately, start to mount. And it's when average fantasy draft positions begin to take shape.\nOf course, every fantasy draft is different, and a value pick in one league can just as easily be a reach in another. That's why ADPs and predraft rankings should be used as a tool, not a rule.\nWith that in mind, here are some thoughts about the top overall players in fantasy football for 2025.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST\nFantasy football rankings: Top overall players\nObviously, a fantasy league's format greatly affects how players are valued. Most leagues out there start one quarterback and award points for receptions. So these overall rankings are geared toward half-point PPR scoring. Let's analyze them in chunks.\n- WR Ja'Marr Chase, Bengals\n- RB Bijan Robinson, Falcons\n- RB Saquon Barkley, Eagles\n- WR Justin Jefferson, Vikings\n- RB Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions\n- WR CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys\n- WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions\n- WR Puka Nacua, Rams\n- WR Malik Nabers, Giants\n- RB Derrick Henry, Ravens\n- WR Nico Collins, Texans\n- RB De'Von Achane, Dolphins\n- Elite running backs are most valuable at the top of the draft, but there is a wealth of high-volume wide receivers among the overall top 12. Malik Nabers may be the biggest risk-reward first-round pick.\n- RB Ashton Jeanty, Raiders\n- WR A.J. Brown, Eagles\n- RB Christian McCaffrey, 49ers\n- TE Brock Bowers, Raiders\n- WR Brian Thomas Jr., Jaguars\n- WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks\n- RB Chase Brown, Bengals\n- RB Jonathan Taylor, Colts\n- WR Ladd McConkey, Chargers\n- TE Trey McBride, Cardinals\n- RB Kyren Williams, Rams\n- RB Bucky Irving, Buccaneers\n- How good can rookie Ashton Jeanty be? Better than established veterans such as Christian McCaffrey and Jonathan Taylor? Yeah, he can. Brock Bowers and Trey McBride are worth second-round picks at tight end.\n- QB Lamar Jackson, Ravens\n- WR Drake London, Falcons\n- QB Jalen Hurts, Eagles\n- QB Jayden Daniels, Commanders\n- RB Josh Jacobs, Packers\n- QB Josh Allen, Bills\n- WR Terry McLaurin, Commanders\n- WR Tyreek Hill, Dolphins\n- WR Tee Higgins, Bengals\n- RB Breece Hall, Jets\n- TE George Kittle, 49ers\n- WR Mike Evans, Buccaneers\n- If you want a top quarterback, get him in Round 3. Also, Drake London seems to mark a new tier of wide receiver here.\n- RB James Cook, Bills\n- WR Davante Adams, Rams\n- WR Garrett Wilson, Jets\n- RB Kenneth Walker III, Seahawks\n- WR DJ Moore, Bears\n- RB James Conner, Cardinals\n- WR Marvin Harrison Jr., Cardinals\n- WR DeVonta Smith, Eagles\n- RB Alvin Kamara, Saints\n- WR Courtland Sutton, Broncos\n- WR DK Metcalf, Steelers\n- WR Rashee Rice, Chiefs\n- RB Chuba Hubbard, Panthers\n- WR Jameson Williams, Lions\n- Try to land at least a couple wide receivers in the top 50 picks.\n- RB Joe Mixon, Texans\n- RB Aaron Jones Sr., Vikings\n- QB Joe Burrow, Bengals\n- WR Zay Flowers, Ravens\n- RB David Montgomery, Lions\n- TE Sam LaPorta, Lions\n- RB Omarion Hampton, Chargers\n- WR Xavier Worthy, Chiefs\n- RB D'Andre Swift, Bears\n- WR Chris Godwin, Buccaneers\n- This is a good part of the draft to speculate on running backs \u2014 or get your first one if you subscribe to the Zero RB strategy. Will Sam LaPorta last this long?\n- QB Kyler Murray, Cardinals\n- QB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs\n- WR Jerry Jeudy, Browns\n- RB RJ Harvey, Broncos\n- RB Tony Pollard, Titans\n- TE T.J. Hockenson, Vikings\n- RB Kaleb Johnson, Steelers\n- WR Rome Odunze, Bears\n- WR George Pickens, Cowboys\n- RB Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs\n- RB Tyrone Tracy Jr., Giants\n- WR Tetairoa McMillan, Panthers\n- WR Jordan Addison, Vikings\n- Finding some WR gold here is definitely possible. Also, could one team possibly land both Patrick Mahomes AND Travis Kelce at this point in the draft?\n- TE Travis Kelce, Chiefs\n- RB TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots\n- RB Jaylen Warren, Steelers\n- QB Jared Goff, Lions\n- WR Jaylen Waddle, Dolphins\n- WR Jakobi Meyers, Raiders\n- QB Baker Mayfield, Buccaneers\n- RB Najee Harris, Chargers\n- WR Calvin Ridley, Titans\n- TE Evan Engram, Broncos\n- RB Brian Robinson Jr., Commanders\n- TE Mark Andrews, Ravens\n- WR Chris Olave, Saints\n- RB Travis Etienne Jr., Jaguars\n- QB Brock Purdy, 49ers\n- WR Jauan Jennings, 49ers\n- QB Bo Nix, Broncos\n- Waiting on quarterbacks any later than this can turn into a high-stakes game of chicken.\n- WR Khalil Shakir, Bills\n- RB Javonte Williams, Cowboys\n- WR Travis Hunter, Jaguars\n- TE David Njoku, Browns\n- WR Stefon Diggs, Patriots\n- TE Jonnu Smith, Steelers\n- QB Dak Prescott, Cowboys\n- RB Quinshon Judkins, Browns\n- RB Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks\n- QB Justin Herbert, Chargers\n- WR Cooper Kupp, Seahawks\n- RB Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots\n- QB C.J. Stroud, Texans\n- QB Justin Fields, Jets\n- At this point, give serious consideration to talented rookies and players who've changed teams in the offseason.\n- TE Dalton Kincaid, Bills\n- WR Jayden Reed, Packers\n- QB J.J. McCarthy, Vikings\n- WR Deebo Samuel Sr., Commanders\n- WR Josh Downs, Colts\n- TE Dallas Goedert, Eagles\n- TE Tucker Kraft, Packers\n- QB Caleb Williams, Bears\n- RB Rachaad White, Buccaneers\n- WR Ricky Pearsall, 49ers\n- WR Michael Pittman Jr., Colts\n- RB Cam Skattebo, Giants\n- RB Tyjae Spears, Titans\n- QB Drake Maye, Patriots\n- RB Jordan Mason, Vikings\n- WR Matthew Golden, Packers\n- RB Tank Bigsby, Jaguars\n- WR Darnell Mooney, Falcons\n- TE Jake Ferguson, Cowboys\n- QB Jordan Love, Packers\n- WR Emeka Egbuka, Buccaneers\n- RB Tyler Allgeier, Falcons\n- WR Rashid Shaheed, Saints\n- QB Trevor Lawrence, Jaguars\n- RB J.K. Dobbins, Broncos\n- TE Kyle Pitts, Falcons\n- RB Isaac Guerendo, 49ers\n- WR Keon Coleman, Bills\n- Players with raw talent and plausible upside \u2014 even if they don't have a major role just yet \u2014 are great picks here in the middle rounds.\n- QB Tua Tagovailoa, Dolphins\n- RB Jerome Ford, Browns\n- WR Wan'Dale Robinson, Giants\n- WR Rashod Bateman, Ravens\n- TE Hunter Henry, Patriots\n- QB Matthew Stafford, Rams\n- WR Jayden Higgins, Texans\n- RB Bhayshul Tuten, Jaguars\n- WR Luther Burden III, Bears\n- RB Justice Hill, Ravens\n- TE Isaiah Likely, Ravens\n- RB Rico Dowdle, Panthers\n- RB Austin Ekeler, Commanders\n- QB Bryce Young, Panthers\n- RB Ray Davis, Bills\n- WR Brandon Aiyuk, 49ers\n- WR Adam Thielen, Panthers\n- RB Jaylen Wright Dolphins\n- It's all personal preference as we come to the end of the top 150. Pick your favorites and grab them, regardless of where they rank.\n- DST Philadelphia Eagles\n- QB Aaron Rodgers, Steelers\n- WR Marvin Mims Jr., Broncos\n- TE Tyler Warren, Colts\n- RB Trey Benson, Cardinals\n- RB Jaydon Blue, Cowboys\n- TE Colston Loveland, Bears\n- QB Michael Penix Jr., Falcons\n- RB Braelon Allen, Jets\n- D/ST Baltimore Ravens\n- Time to start thinking about the top defenses/special teams.\n- RB Roschon Johnson, Bears\n- WR Tre' Harris, Chargers\n- RB Ty Johnson, Bills\n- WR Christian Kirk, Texans\n- WR Quentin Johnston, Chargers\n- D/ST Denver Broncos\n- WR Alec Pierce, Colts\n- RB Nick Chubb, Texans\n- WR DeAndre Hopkins, Ravens\n- D/ST Pittsburgh Steelers\n- D/ST Houston Texans\n- TE Cade Otton, Buccaneers\n- WR Marquise Brown, Chiefs\n- RB MarShawn Lloyd, Packers\n- WR Jalen McMillan, Buccaneers\n- RB Dylan Sampson, Browns\n- WR Cedric Tillman, Browns\n- QB Sam Darnold, Seahawks\n- WR Romeo Doubs, Packers\n- TE Pat Freiermuth, Steelers\n- RB Blake Corum, Rams\n- D/ST Seattle Seahawks\n- WR Kyle Williams, Patriots\n- D/ST Minnesota Vikings\n- D/ST Buffalo Bills\n- K Brandon Aubrey, Cowboys\n- D/ST Green Bay Packers\n- RB Kareem Hunt, Chiefs\n- D/ST Detroit Lions\n- D/ST Kansas City Chiefs\n- K Cameron Dicker, Chargers\n- K Jake Bates, Lions\n- DST New York Jets\n- WR Xavier Legette, Panthers\n- TE Zach Ertz, Commanders\n- WR DeMario Douglas, Patriots\n- K Chase McLaughlin, Buccaneers\n- WR Joshua Palmer, Bills\n- K Wil Lutz, Broncos\n- RB DJ Giddens, Colts"

      "text": "Fantasy football burning questions: Analyzing the NFC North\nAs NFL teams get ready to open training camps and prepare for the 2025 season, fantasy football draft season can't be too far away.\nAs a refresher course in what's transpired over the offseason and a preview of what might be in store for each team, USA TODAY Sports is conducting a virtual tour through each division to get a sense of the most important issue or question facing every team from a fantasy standpoint.\nWhether it's a new arrival or departure, an important position battle, a player under the gun or a potential breakout, we have the fantasy insights to help shape your draft strategy.\nFANTASY PREVIEWS: NFC North | AFC North | NFC East | AFC East | AFC South | NFC South | NFC West | AFC West\nToday, we take a closer look at the NFC North.\nDetroit Lions (15-2 last season)\nWill the offense look any different under new offensive coordinator John Morton?\nWith fantasy stalwarts Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Sam LaPorta, the Lions led the NFL in scoring in 2024. They were so good they got OC Ben Johnson a head coaching job in the offseason (more on that in a moment).\nGibbs is a consensus top-5 overall fantasy pick anyway, but he could be even more valuable this season as a receiver. \"I'm being split out like way more than I was the past two years,\" Gibbs recently told Detroit TV station WXYZ. \"That's good. That's going to be fun. I've been waiting on that.\"\nPutting Gibbs out wide would allow the Lions to get Montgomery on the field more frequently \u2013 and further open up the field for St. Brown, LaPorta and wideout Jameson Williams.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Jahmyr Gibbs (RB2, overall: 5)\n- Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR6, overall: 8)\n- Sam LaPorta (TE4, overall: 57)\n- Jameson Williams (WR31, overall: 61)\n- David Montgomery (RB21, overall: 62)\n- Jared Goff (QB14, overall: 97)\nMinnesota Vikings (14-3)\nDoes who's playing quarterback really matter?\nWith the departure of Pro Bowler Sam Darnold, the Vikings offense is now in the hands of first-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy.\nMcCarthy will need to prove he can run the offense after missing all of last season with a knee injury, but star wide receiver Justin Jefferson has shown he can put up elite numbers regardless of whether it's Kirk Cousins, Josh Dobbs, Nick Mullens or Darnold under center.\nThe biggest leap in production could come from tight end T.J. Hockenson, who spent the first eight weeks of last season on the sidelines with McCarthy while recovering from a torn ACL. They'll have a full training camp together to get on the same page. Aaron Jones also returns as the lead running back.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Justin Jefferson (WR3, overall: 4)\n- Aaron Jones (RB24, overall: 68)\n- T.J. Hockenson (TE5, overall: 69)\n- Jordan Addison (WR36, overall: 78)\n- J.J. McCarthy (QB20)\nGreen Bay Packers (11-5)\nWill a No. 1 wide receiver eventually emerge?\nIn 2023, his first season as the Packers' starting quarterback, Jordan Love threw for 4,159 yards and 32 touchdowns \u2013 finishing as the QB5 for the season. However, in 2024 those numbers dropped to 3,389 and 25 as the receiving corps went through a rash of injuries and underproduction.\nChristian Watson may be the most talented of the group, but he's coming off a torn ACL in January and may not be at full strength early in the season. Jayden Reed provides an added threat as a rusher, but he suffered a dislocated shoulder in the playoffs. There's also Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks and newcomer Mecole Hardman. Added to the mix in 2025: first-round draft pick Matthew Golden and third-rounder Savion Williams. That's an awful lot of mouths to feed, so someone almost has to go hungry.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Josh Jacobs (RB10, overall: 30)\n- Tucker Kraft (TE10, overall: 103)\n- Jayden Reed (WR46)\n- Jordan Love (QB17)\nChicago Bears (5-12)\nCan Caleb Williams make a second-year leap?\nBen Johnson takes over as head coach, looking to bring his success in Detroit to the division-rival Bears. His first task is getting last year's No. 1 overall draft pick, QB Caleb Williams, on track. The front office tried hard to give the rookie as many weapons as possible but the results were underwhelming as the Bears ranked last in the NFL in total yards per game. Meanwhile, Williams was sacked a league-high 68 times and finished as the QB16.\nAfter spending the ninth overall pick last season on WR Rome Odunze, the Bears focused on offense again at the top of this year's draft, taking Michigan tight end Colston Loveland at No. 10 overall. Veteran RB D'Andre Swift and WR D.J. Moore are still around as well, so experience \u2013 and perhaps the best teacher in Johnson \u2013 could be the recipe for unlocking Williams' potential. The addition of All-Pro guard Joe Thuney to a revamped offensive line should also help.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- D.J. Moore (WR20, overall: 41)\n- D'Andre Swift (RB22, overall: 65)\n- Rome Odunze (WR37, overall: 80)\n- Caleb Williams (QB12, overall: 94)"

In 2024, it was a roller coaster ride that saw all four teams in contention for the division title at some point before the Los Angeles Rams won the crown via tiebreaker over the Seattle Seahawks.\nThe NFC West had a 10-win champion, tied with the AFC South (Houston) and NFC South (Tampa Bay) for the fewest last season. But its last-placed team in 2024 - the San Francisco 49ers - had more wins (six) than any other last-placed team league-wide.\nNo team established itself as the dominant force. Things could change in 2025 as teams across the division made significant changes this offseason.\nSeattle brought in a new offensive coordinator and quarterback for 2025. The Rams signed a three-time All-Pro wide receiver. Arizona invested heavily in defense via both free agency and the 2025 NFL Draft. San Francisco brought back defensive coordinator Robert Saleh and lost many familiar faces on offense and defense via free agency and trades.\nMany of these moves will have fantasy football implications. There are plenty of questions for each team ahead of the 2025 season but we've settled on one big one for each franchise.\nHere's our one burning question for each team in the NFC West.\nFantasy football questions: NFC West\nArizona Cardinals\nWill Marvin Harrison Jr. make a leap in Year 2?\nCardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzig operates one of the most diverse and unpredictable run schemes in the league. Defenses are tasked with preparing for all types of schemes for James Conner and company to churn out tough yards.\nThe same can't be said for the pass offense. It was head-scratching campaign 2024; tight end Trey McBride enjoyed a breakout season but didn't score a touchdown until Week 17. Without a designated deep threat in the receiving corps, that fell on Harrison's shoulders.\nHarrison entered the league as one of the top fade route receivers in recent college football history. Quarterback Kyler Murray has a history of throwing those well. But neither could get on the same page. Arizona targeted Harrison on fade routes more than all but one receiver league-wide in 2024 and he caught six of them.\nIf it wasn't for the incredible success of fellow 2024 draftees Brian Thomas Jr., Malik Nabers and Ladd McConkey, Harrison's rookie year might have felt less disappointing. He's bulked up ahead of the 2025 season and that could help him adjust to the pro game better. But will Petzig and Murray get the most out of him? That could be the difference between WR8 and WR20 this season.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Trey McBride (TE2, overall: 19)\n- Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR21, overall: 42)\n- James Conner (RB18, overall: 51)\n- Kyler Murray (QB9, overall: 76)\n- Trey Benson (RB47, overall: 145)\n- Michael Wilson (WR74, overall: 195)\nLos Angeles Rams\nCan Davante Adams be a top-15 fantasy WR again?\nLos Angeles brought in one of the top wide receivers of his generation this offseason by signing Davante Adams to a two-year, $46 million deal. The three-time All-Pro should slide in and fill the void left by longtime Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp, now in Seattle.\nAdams managed more than 1,000 yards and eight touchdowns in 14 games with the Raiders and Jets in 2024. That made him WR12 in standard scoring leagues and WR11 in PPR formats.\nIn 2025, he'll have Matthew Stafford throwing the ball to him in Sean McVay's scheme, with Puka Nacua taking attention from the defense. That's a pretty sweet setup.\nBut Nacua may take a large share of the targets to keep Adams from repeating that performance. Nacua was still WR26 in PPR leagues despite playing just 10 games in 2024. Kupp played in 12 games and was WR38.\nNacua will likely be the top dog in the passing game in 2025. If healthy all season, Adams will be the No. 2 weapon, but he is entering his age-33 season. It's tempting to paint the best-case scenario for the veteran receiver but this may be a case of a player being a better asset in real-world football than the fantasy realm.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Puka Nacua (WR4, overall: 6)\n- Davante Adams (WR17, overall: 32)\n- Kyren Williams (RB12, overall: 38)\n- Matthew Stafford (QB21, overall: 126)\n- Blake Corum (RB57, overall: 180)\n- Los Angeles Rams D/ST (D/ST11, overall: 202)\nSan Francisco 49ers\nWhat will Christian McCaffrey be in 2025?\nMcCaffrey was a fantasy football championship winner in 2023. He was the top-scoring running back by a country mile, especially in full PPR formats, in addition to winning Offensive Player of the Year.\nLast season was a different story. Injuries kept him off the field for much of the season and when he appeared things weren't very good. He played just under 75% of snaps from Weeks 10 through 13 with 86.5 total yards per game \u2013 his lowest figure since his rookie year in 2017 (67.9). He failed to score a touchdown for the first time in his career.\nThis offseason, McCaffrey's been on the field for minicamp, an improvement from a year ago. But San Francisco drafted Oregon running back Jordan James in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. As a powerful back who excels in short yardage and red zone situations, James could hawk some touchdowns from McCaffrey.\nWith no timetable for wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk's return and fellow wideout Ricky Pearsall dealing with a hamstring injury, McCaffrey may end up being deployed more as a de facto wide receiver while James and speedy second-year back Isaac Guerendo take up carries. Or McCaffrey could stay the lead back as the 49ers lean more into the run game early on but see fewer end zone touches with James' arrival. It's tough to tell.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Christian McCaffrey (RB6, overall: 17)\n- George Kittle (TE3, overall: 34)\n- Jauan Jennings (WR39, overall: 83)\n- Brock Purdy (QB11, overall: 92)\n- Ricky Pearsall (WR47, overall: 107)\n- Brandon Aiyuk (WR48, overall: 111)\nSeattle Seahawks\nCan Jaxon Smith-Njigba be a top-5 fantasy WR in 2025?\nSmith-Njigba hit 100 receptions and 1,000 yards in his sophomore season in 2024. The No. 20 overall pick from the 2023 NFL Draft made the Pro Bowl and established himself as the top pass-catcher in Seattle, finishing as a top-10 wide receiver in half and full PPR formats.\nSeattle overhauled its offense for 2025 notably with a new coordinator in Klint Kubiak. The former Saints offensive coordinator will bring a different system to Seattle compared to last year's coordinator, Ryan Grubb, and one that should complement new Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold's skillset.\nMetcalf and longtime Seahawks wideout Tyler Lockett are both out. In their place are Washington native Kupp and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Neither will likely challenge Smith-Njigba for status as the top target in the passing game.\nSmith-Njigba already is a top-10 wide receiver in fantasy football. In Kubiak's system with Darnold at quarterback, he could conceivably challenge for top-5 status.\nTop players (Fantasy Pros ADP)\n- Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR12, overall: 20)\n- Kenneth Walker III (RB15, overall: 43)\n- Cooper Kupp (WR45, overall: 104)\n- Zach Charbonnet (RB36, overall: 114)\n- Sam Darnold (QB26, overall: 166)\n- Seattle Seahawks D/ST (D/ST12, overall: 206)"

      "text": "Who should be No. 1 pick in fantasy football? Ranking 5 best options\nIn the actual NFL draft, NFL teams always want the No. 1 overall pick. In fantasy football drafts, the desire of fantasy managers varies.\nSome prefer to have the top selection, as it gives them their preferred target atop the draft. Others would rather draft near the end of the snake and get an earlier pick in the second round.\nAs such, the No. 1 overall fantasy pick can be viewed as either a blessing or a curse. But either way, fantasy managers need to make sure they get the pick right. If they don't, their roster depth will suffer as a result.\nWho are the best options for the top fantasy selection this season? Below is a look at the only five players fantasy football managers should consider taking atop the draft, starting with a running back who was a league-winner for many last season.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nNo. 1 pick options in fantasy football\n1. Saquon Barkley, RB, Philadelphia Eagles\nBarkley was the top fantasy running back last year as he generated just the ninth 2,000-yard rushing season in NFL history. He figures to once again be a highly productive runner after averaging 3.8 yards before contact per carry \u2014 a whopping 0.5 yards better than any other running back \u2014 behind a stellar Philadelphia offensive line.\nThe only concern with Barkley? He had a league-high 378 touches during the regular season and added another 104 to his ledger in the postseason. Since 2010, running backs with at least 337 touches in a season have seen an average decline of 113.9 PPR points, and 3.9 fewer PPR points per game, the following season.\n2. Ja'Marr Chase, WR, Cincinnati Bengals\nChase won the receiving Triple Crown in 2024, leading the league in catches (127), yards (1,708) and touchdowns (17). He could certainly do it again, given the chemistry he has shown with long-time teammate Joe Burrow and the Bengals' high-volume passing attack.\nReceiver production is generally more consistent year-to-year than running back production, so few would fault anyone for taking Chase No. 1 overall, especially in PPR leagues. But in half-PPR or standard formats, it is difficult to pass on a high-end running back given how quickly top-tier talents at the position come off the board in snake drafts.\n3. Bijan Robinson, RB, Atlanta Falcons\nOnly two running backs had more catches than Robinson's 61 in 2024: De'Von Achane (78) and Alvin Kamara (68). That gives Robinson one of the highest PPR floors among fantasy running backs, and his on-the-ground production (1,456 yards, 14 touchdowns) is nothing to sneeze at, either.\nLike Barkley, Robinson surpassed the dreaded 337-touch mark in 2024 with 365. Robinson, 23, is much younger than the 28-year-old Barkley, which might aid him in avoiding a decline. However, he also plays in a more volatile offense that will be entrusting second-year QB Michael Penix Jr. as a full-time starter for the first time.\n4. Jahmyr Gibbs, RB, Detroit Lions\nGibbs showed fantasy managers his potential as a workhorse over the final three weeks of the 2024 NFL season. With David Montgomery out, Gibbs averaged 25.7 touches and 162.3 total yards per game while scoring six total touchdowns.\nWhile Gibbs' ceiling is that of the No. 1 overall fantasy running back, Montgomery still figures to eat into his workload. Montgomery's size (5-11, 224 pounds) will likely make him Dan Campbell's preferred goal-line option. That might limit Gibbs' upside, but it's worth noting he had the fewest touches (302) among the consensus top-three fantasy running backs for 2025.\n5. Justin Jefferson, WR, Minnesota Vikings\nJefferson has only once finished worse than the No. 6-rated wide receiver in fantasy. That came in 2023, when he played just 10 games because of a hamstring injury. As long as Jefferson remains healthy, he should be one of the best fantasy football wide receivers, which puts him in the running for the No. 1 overall pick.\nStill, Jefferson seems more likely to be an early-to-mid first-round selection. The Vikings are breaking in a first-year starter at quarterback, J.J. McCarthy, so any early growing pains could impact Jefferson out of the gate. So, too, could a mild hamstring strain that is keeping Jefferson out of the early stages of Minnesota's training camp."
