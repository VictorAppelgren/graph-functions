      "summary": "Thailand’s new Bank of Thailand governor, Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput, warned that political uncertainty and structural reforms are limiting growth, yet he maintains the 2% 2025 GDP target. He highlighted low policy space with rates at 1.5%, the need for fiscal consolidation, and the risk of a property bubble and declining Chinese tourism. The governor emphasized the importance of long‑term structural reforms and maintaining central bank independence amid calls for further rate cuts. Overall, he signals cautious monetary policy but acknowledges limited upside and the need for deeper reforms to boost resilience.",
