      "summary": "Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said wage hikes are spreading beyond large firms and are likely to accelerate as the labor market tightens, signaling optimism that conditions for another interest‑rate hike are emerging. He noted that decades of stagnant wages, driven by entrenched deflationary expectations, have been broken by the pandemic‑induced inflation shock, and that wage growth is now rising across small and medium enterprises. Ueda highlighted demographic shifts that are creating acute labor shortages, higher participation, mobility and capital‑labor substitution, which will complicate the link between wages and prices. He added that the BOJ will closely monitor these supply‑side developments and incorporate them into monetary policy, following a pause in rate hikes caused by concerns over U.S. tariffs. The remarks were made alongside other central bank leaders at the Jackson Hole conference, reinforcing expectations of a resumed rate‑hike cycle.",
