      "summary": "President Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland to combat what he calls runaway crime, even though data shows violent crime in those cities has fallen in the first half of 2025 compared to 2024. The article highlights that crime rates have declined post‑pandemic, with homicides and aggravated assaults down in most of the targeted cities, and that public opinion sees crime as a major problem but is largely opposed to federal takeover of local police. Trump’s remarks have drawn criticism from city officials, who argue that the National Guard would be ineffective and politically motivated, and from the public, who are wary of militarizing urban law enforcement. The piece also notes that the president’s rhetoric may influence market sentiment, particularly in equity indices and the U.S. dollar, as investors weigh the political risk of federal intervention.",
