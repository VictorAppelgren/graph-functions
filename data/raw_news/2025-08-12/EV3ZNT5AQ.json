  "description": "He imposed a 47-month prison term on Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, who was convicted of fraud. Sentencing guidelines recommended up to 24 years.",
  "content": "T.S. Ellis III, a federal judge who shocked many judicial observers in 2019 when he sentenced Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, to 47 months in prison after sentencing guidelines had recommended up to 24 years behind bars as punishment for his engineering a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme, died on July 30 at his home in Keswick, Va. He was 85.\n\nHis wife, Rebecca Garrou Ellis, said the cause was complications of Covid-19.\n\nSitting in the Eastern District of Virginia, Judge Ellis presided in several high-profile cases, including the 2002 plea bargain of John Walker Lindh, the Californian (labeled \u201cthe American Taliban\u201d in the news media) who fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Sentenced to 20 years in prison as part of the agreement, Mr. Lindh was freed on probation in 2019.\n\nJudge Ellis also oversaw the corruption trial of former Rep. William J. Jefferson, Democrat of Louisiana, in 2009, in which Mr. Jefferson, known by political opponents as \u201cDollar Bill,\u201d was convicted on 11 charges of racketeering, bribery and money laundering involving business activities in Africa. Though Mr. Jefferson was sentenced to 13 years in prison, Judge Ellis tossed out seven of the charges and released him in 2017.\n\nAn often sharp-tongued jurist, Judge Ellis was known for sparring with lawyers on both sides in a case, running brisk trials \u2014 his court in Alexandria was known as the \u201crocket docket\u201d \u2014 and sometimes going off on personal tangents.",
