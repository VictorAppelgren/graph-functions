Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report. (Eric Lee/Getty Images)\n\nViolent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.\n\nThe declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 \u2014 one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nHomicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.\n\nProperty crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.\n\nThe 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies \u2014 2.1% more than last year \u2014 representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI\u2019s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.\n\nAbout 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI\u2019s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.\n\nThe data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI\u2019s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.\n\nAlthough the FBI\u2019s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nStateline reporter Amanda Hern\u00e1ndez can be reached at ahernandez@stateline.org.\n\nStateline and the Nebraska Examiner are part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
