      "feedback": "The draft largely satisfies the regime-based framing and keeps a clear, tradable-mindset through a regime A tilt, but it fails the 4-line Movers rule by including a separate “Long” line in the Movers section and (as a result) muddles the focus between 4 movers and the Outlook; tighten this by removing the long ABT/ABBV/PFE line from Movers and moving it to the Swing Trade outlook (one line) per constraints; ensure the 4 Movers are exactly 2 Up and 2 Down, each with crisp, first-principles drivers (anchor each line to inflation regime, policy reaction function, and price of risk via discount-rate dynamics) and to quantifiable triggers; sharpen the “What to watch” fields so they are actionably metric (e.g., CPI/ Fed guidance thresholds, tariff-announcement cadence, Nvidia AI-capex cadence, LOE milestones) and tie each watch item to a concrete numeric or event-based trigger; calibrate the Probability % to reflect the material’s evidence footing rather than intuition (e.g., base regime persistence around a mid/high probability with tail-risk weights clearly sketched, and provide ranges if exact points aren’t stated in sources); improve citation discipline by ensuring every factual claim tied to a fact or number uses an IDs-only citation, and keep coverage tightly to sources that underpin the regime map (Y6SQOEK69, 22PL3Q360, 9, 15, STBVARD8F, SGB2PAZGK, WISLWAJ15, LLN6N4H3Z) without importing conflicting material; for coherence, align each Up/Down line to a single causal chain (Regime A persistence supports higher discount rates and durable cash flows; tariff/shock tail risks reprice inflation and margins; a plausible Regime B transition hinges on CPI relative to target and easing expectations) and surface any conflicts in a brief reconciliation note; in the Outlook Swing Trade line, use the existing 12–16% target and 6–8% stop for ABT/ABBV/PFE, but present as a single-line Swing Trade with Direction, Horizon, Entry near current level, Stop, Target, R/R, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability, Confidence, all grounded in WISLWAJ15, and clearly label Expected path/levels and decision signals to satisfy the 1–2 line constraint.",
