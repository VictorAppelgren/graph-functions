      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid start but still falls short of the Argos “elite bar” on several fronts. Below is a concise, actionable checklist that will lift it to world‑class quality:\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping**  \n   *Add an explicit link to a handle.*  \n   - Replace “risk premium” with a concrete mapping: **ust10y** (10‑year U.S. Treasury yield).  \n   - Cite the handle in parentheses: *ust10y (10‑yr U.S. Treasury)*.  \n   - If you want to broaden the transmission, add a secondary handle: **dxy** (U.S. Dollar Index) to capture currency spill‑over.\n\n2. **Quantitative Ranges & Confidence**  \n   *Provide concrete numbers and confidence bands.*  \n   - State the baseline spread over the risk‑free benchmark: **5–10 bp**.  \n   - Quantify the upside if litigation materialises: **+15–25 bp** to the 10‑yr yield.  \n   - Include a confidence rating (e.g., *moderate* or *high*), and back it with a brief rationale (e.g., “legal pathway is clear but litigation outcomes are uncertain”).\n\n3. **Causal Chain & Transmission Path**  \n   *Explicitly map each leg of the chain.*  \n   - **ICJ opinion → legal risk → increased risk premium → higher ust10y**.  \n   - Add a short sentence explaining the mechanism: *“The advisory opinion raises the perceived sovereign default risk, which market participants price into the 10‑yr yield.”*\n\n4. **Catalyst Window & Invalidations**  \n   *Specify dates and potential reversals.*  \n   - **Catalyst:** COP30 in November 2025; U.S. delegation’s stance will crystallise.  \n   - **Invalidation:** A U.S. court ruling that the ICJ opinion is unenforceable (e.g., *SCOTUS decision on 2026*).  \n   - Add a “watch list” sentence: *“Monitor U.S. Treasury climate‑policy releases and any U.S. court rulings on the enforceability of the ICJ opinion.”*\n\n5. **Macro Pillar Integration**  \n   *Tie the view to the broader macro framework.*  \n   - Mention **monetary policy** (Fed stance) and **inflation expectations** (how higher yields feed into the Phillips curve).  \n   - Briefly note the potential impact on **FX** (DXY) and **commodities** (e.g., **gold** as a hedge).\n\n6. **Source Citations & Avoidance of Generic Language**  \n   *Add inline citations (e.g., (ZV3QI3K19)).*  \n   - Replace vague phrases like “legal risk” with *“risk of climate litigation as quantified by the ICJ advisory opinion (ZV3QI3K19)”*.  \n   - Ensure every substantive claim has a source ID.\n\n7. **Remove Drift**  \n   *Any sentence that does not tie back to a canonical handle or a catalyst should be removed or re‑phrased.*  \n   - For example, the sentence *“The opinion’s non‑binding nature does not alter policy immediately”* can be tightened to *“Because the opinion is non‑binding, immediate policy change is unlikely, but the legal risk is priced into the 10‑yr yield (ust10y).”*\n\n**Revised Skeleton (for reference):**\n\n> The ICJ’s July 23 advisory opinion (ZV3QI3K19) declares that developed states, notably the U.S., have a legal duty to cut GHG emissions and may owe reparations. This introduces a new sovereign‑risk premium that market participants price into the **ust10y** (5–10 bp baseline; +15–25 bp if litigation succeeds). The transmission path is: *ICJ opinion → legal risk → risk premium → higher ust10y*. The primary catalyst window is COP30 in November 2025; a U.S. commitment to the Paris framework will dampen the premium, while continued withdrawal will amplify it. An invalidation scenario is a U.S. court ruling that the opinion is unenforceable (e.g., SCOTUS 2026), which would revert the premium to 5–10 bp. Watch for U.S. Treasury climate‑policy releases and any U.S. court rulings on enforceability. The view is anchored in the Fed’s monetary stance and inflation expectations, with spill‑overs to **dxy** and **gold**.\n\nFollow this checklist and you’ll meet the Argos standards: concise, defensible, and fully mapped to canonical handles with clear catalysts and quantitative ranges.",
