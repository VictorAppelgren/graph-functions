      "feedback": "Strong work on the underlying causal logic and the four-regime framing, but the draft overfits a sprawling narrative into a decision-agnostic briefing; to reach world-class, condense to a 4–6 sentence, executive brief and tighten the horizon to a single, decision-ready house view anchored to the cited sources. Key edits: (1) fix a single, consistent base/tariff/AI leadership probability map for the 3–6 month horizon (e.g., Base 45–55%, Tariff-escalation 20–30%, AI/EV-led 25–35%), with explicit rationale anchored to NL5YYTLF2 and SGB2PAZGK, and remove dueling base-case percentages elsewhere; (2) replace the lengthy Shopify 0–3 week narrative with a tight, one-line reaction function tied to tariff timing or GM capex cadence, or relocate to an appendix; (3) ensure every factual claim has a cited source ID (e.g., Ford 22PL3Q360, KO/PG/SBUX fundamentals STBVARD8F, Nvidia/AI list STBVARD8F, oil/regime inputs J99EM2TPZ; T1QE6JPIX), and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., Ford margins/ROIC vs regime implications) in a single reconciled note; (4) standardize numeric ranges (multiples, dividends, growth deltas) and avoid repeated figures; (5) add a clear invalidation trigger (e.g., wage/inflation surprise that shifts regime probabilities by 15–20 points or a tariff durability breach) and 1–2 concrete catalysts with time windows (tariff timetables, GM capex cadence, Costa/Shopify guidance, Nvidia AI leadership moves); (6) ensure all critical sources are covered and cited in-line, not bolted on at the end, and trim redundancies/duplicative causal chains to deliver a crisp, decision-ready watchlist and 1–2 data cadence lines.",
