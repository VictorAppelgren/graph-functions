  "description": "Ankit Jain, the shadow Senator for the District of Columbia, said President Trump should focus on adding judges, not policing.",
  "content": "The crime rate in the nation\u2019s capital has been falling in spite of President Trump\u2019s actions in his second term, said Ankit Jain, a shadow senator for the District of Columbia, soon after the president announced a temporary takeover of policing in the city.\n\n\u201cWe have a historic judicial vacancy crisis in D.C.,\u201d said Mr. Jain, who serves as one of the District\u2019s elected advocates before the U.S. Senate. He noted that the city is down two judges out of nine on its high court, the D.C. court of appeals. \u201cWhat happens when you don\u2019t have enough judges? Trials get delayed, crime goes up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy has the president not made this a priority of nominating judges?\u201d\n\nMr. Jain said the vacancy crisis in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, which prosecutes all adult crimes, also posed a problem for the city. Mr. Trump recently installed an ally, the former Fox News host Jeannine Pirro, as the U.S. attorney for Washington after he was forced his pull his first choice for the job.\n\n\u201cPirro\u2019s predecessor fired attorneys who prosecuted violent insurrectionists from Jan. 6,\u201d Mr. Jain said, referring to another Trump appointee, Ed Martin. \u201cNow we\u2019re facing a vacancy crisis in her office, too.\u201d",
