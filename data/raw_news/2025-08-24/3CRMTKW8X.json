  "title": "Why Did Hyundai Discontinue The Santa Fe's Dual-Clutch Transmission?",
  "description": "Hyundai will be discontinuing the Dual-Clutch Transmission in its Santa Fe SUVs in the 2026 model year, but what led to this monumental decision?",
  "content": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is an affordable three-row SUV with a boldly designed body that is reminiscent of a Land Rover, but with a base price of $34,300 MSRP plus $1,495 freight. While the Santa Fe's styling is attractive, the vehicle was delivered to its customers with a hidden problem: a spectacularly high failure rate of 100% that impacts its eight-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). As a result, Hyundai has now discontinued the Santa Fe's eight-speed DCT.\n\nAn NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) Safety Recall Report reveals that 12,349 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe vehicles with this transmission were recalled. The report's description of the defect explained that the DCT had a Transmission Control Unit (\"TCU\") with software logic that could inadvertently allow the Santa Fe to roll away after the driver had shifted into Park. Damage to the transmission case and the parking pawl, which locks the output shaft of the transmission when it is shifted into Park, was also a possibility. This is not one of the biggest transmission recalls in recent history, but the failure rate is amazing.\n\nThe remedy for the DCT transmission's defect was to have all Santa Fe owners with this transmission bring their cars to a Hyundai dealer for a TCU software update. If anyone's DCT transmission is determined to be damaged, it will be replaced by Hyundai at no charge, including any out-of-pocket expenses. The Hyundai plant where the Santa Fe is produced has added that software update to its transmissions as of June 14, 2024.",

      "text": "2024 Hyundai Santa Fe Review: Redesigned Crossover Fakes It - And Makes It\nHyundai is an automaker unmoored from history. While it's been making cars since the 1960s, until recently they were cars nobody cared about. The Santa Fe is what passes for an august nameplate in Hyundai lore. It was the automaker's first SUV, and helped lead Hyundai's coming of age in the early 2000s by combining excellent build quality and a generous warranty with lower pricing than rival Japanese products. But it doesn't inspire nostalgia.\nThis lack of a legacy created an opportunity for Hyundai. Whereas other automakers are shackled by history and customer expectations, Hyundai has been free to make the Santa Fe whatever it wants. Over the years the Santa Fe has gotten bigger and chased the automotive styling trends of the moment. Nobody cared that the new Santa Fe wasn't like the previous one.\nSo it will likely be again. Right now, there is nothing cooler than a boxy, traditional off-roader. The redesigned 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe is not a traditional off-roader, but it looks like one. Styling inspired by the early days of the SUV (back when Hyundai was building Ford Cortinas under license) is the headline but, underneath the Santa Few is also a thoughtfully designed modern crossover.\nRelentlessly angular\nNo vehicle in recent memory has undergone as thorough a transformation as the Santa Fe. Hyundai has taken the styling in a completely different direction, from trying to blend in with more car-like vehicles to trying to copy the look of Land Rovers and Land Cruisers.\nGiven the Santa Fe's lack of off-road capability, the boxy shape of the new generation might seem like stolen valor. But Hyundai is simply giving people what they want: a truck-like look without the comprises in packaging, drivability, and efficiency inherent in most true off-roaders. There's a reason why so many traditional SUVs end up in suburbia rather than Patagonia. People just think they're cool.\nHyundai also deserves credit for execution. With respect to the Tesla Cybertruck, this is how you do relentlessly angular, 32-bit styling. The design is full of wonderful details, from the neat way the creased fender flares meet up with the headlights and taillights, to the little \"H\" shape of the lights themselves.\nThose lights also give the front end a distinctive and non-aggressive look many current SUVs lack. Whereas many current SUVs (as well as the previous-generation Santa Fe) combine a big grille with stacked headlights for maximum intimidation, this Santa Fe is approachable, like a friendly robot.\nThoughtful interior\nThe design thoughtfulness continues inside, although it seems Hyundai ran out of creative steam (and budget) partway through. The dashboard vents repeat the \"H\" shape of the exterior lights, and the doors feature large rectangular handles and matching trim pieces that create an appearance of beefiness. The available curved dashboard display reclines into an ident in the dash, and the steering wheel looks vaguely Land Rover-ish.\nEven in this top Calligraphy test vehicle, though, materials are definitely Hyundai-grade, not Land Rover. Everything was faultlessly assembled, but what appears to be brushed stainless steel and wood are in fact plastic. Hyundai also couldn't avoid the trend of using piano black plastic to blend touchscreen surfaces with the surrounding areas, meaning fingerprints and dust might as well be listed as trim elements alongside the plastic wood.\nAvailable purple ambient lighting (you can adjust the color to something less nightclub-like) and light gray upholstery had me thinking of recent Mercedes-Benz models, but the typeface used on the door panels and center console bits had an anodyne appearance that was more airline economy class.\nSurplus of storage space\nThe interior also makes pockets redundant. The Santa Fe adopts the small ratchet shifter previously seen on the Ioniq EVs and the refreshed 2024 Sonata midsize sedan. It makes room for two prominent wireless charging pads, perfectly placed on an elevated tray that leaves room for a storage nook below.\nGloveboxes aren't usually a major talking point in new cars, so kudos to Hyundai for getting us to mention this one. It's actually split into two sections, with a smaller part on top of the dash and a deeper lower section in the usual place. That upper part is handy for stowing smaller items like pens or tire gauges that might otherwise get lost among the owner's manuals, registration documents, and expired insurance cards in the main glovebox.\nMoving further back, the rear doors include no less than three cupholders, with additional cupholders on top of the wheel wells in the third row. Vents and USB ports are crammed back there as well, along with climate controls (albeit only accessible from one seat). Great design takes many forms. Sometimes it's an aesthetically pleasing bit of sheet metal or a clever aero element. Or in this case, it's more mundane things like cupholders that acknowledge how a car will actually be used.\nBig, but not big enough\nThe 2024 Santa Fe regains the third row that wasn't available on the previous-generation model. A slight loss of second-row legroom is the likely penalty of that, but Hyundai managed to find about an inch of additional headroom for those seats. First-row headroom and legroom remain roughly the same, with good outward visibility across the flat hood from the driver's seat.\nA low step-in height makes getting into the first- and second-row seats easier (much more so than in the traditional SUVs the Santa Fe's styling imitates), and this Calligraphy test model's second-row captain's chairs were reasonably comfortable. However, getting into the third row requires an awkward step up onto the rear axle hump, and the higher position of the seat bottoms makes for a less comfortable experience. Even smaller adults will find the third row cramped.\nTypical for a three-row vehicle, the back seats also don't leave much cargo space\u2014just 14.6 cubic feet. Fold them down, though, and the new Santa Fe offers 40.5 cubic feet, and that grows to 79.6 cubic feet with the second row folded. Those are substantial increases of 4.1 cubic feet and 7.5 cubic feet, respectively, over the outgoing two-row Santa Fe. The new model's square back end and low rear bumper also create a wide aperture that makes loading and unloading cargo easier.\nWhile it is a big improvement over the outgoing model, the Santa Fe still trails many other three-row midsize crossovers in cargo space. Some rivals, like the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, and Volkswagen Atlas, offer a bit more third-row legroom that makes sitting back there closer to tolerable for adults.\nCutting the cord\nThe infotainment layout follows current industry trends. A 12.3-inch touchscreen is standard, but an optional setup blends the touchscreen and a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster into one curved display. The more important news here, though, is that wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are supported with both setups. Hyundai (and sibling brand Kia) previously offered wireless connectivity only with smaller entry-level displays. Digital key functionality and over-the-air updates are baked in as well.\nThe curved display was responsive and easy to navigate, although the graphics reminded me of an app designed for a medical practice. The vacuum tube animation previously used for the radio in certain Hyundai and Kia models is missed. The Santa Fe does at least get Hyundai's blind-spot camera system\u2014still one of the most useful features of its kind\u2014as well as a digital rearview mirror that eliminates blind spots created by the third row. Helpfully, Hyundai also includes a hard button for camera views as well.\nThe Santa Fe incorporates the expected array of driver assist features, such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, but Hyundai's most-sophisticated driver aid, Highway Driving Assist, lacks the hands-free capability of the Super Cruise and Blue Cruise systems that will be available on the rival 2024 Chevrolet Traverse and 2025 Ford Explorer, respectively. I also found the lane-keep assist feature to be too sensitive, and ended up turning it off.\nCarryover powertrains\nIt says a lot about the current state of internal-combustion vehicles that the least remarkable parts of the new Santa Fe are its powertrain and other mechanical bits.\nThe exterior design is so noteworthy in part because it's draped over a version of the unibody platform from the previous-generation model. That platform was introduced partway through the outgoing Santa Fe's production run, so it's not stale. But it means that, despite looking dramatically different from most other crossover SUVs, the new Santa Fe isn't that different underneath.\nThe spec sheet likely won't create much excitement, either. Hyundai eliminated the naturally-aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that was previously employed in lower trim levels, making the carryover turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder standard. It now makes 277 horsepower instead of the previous 281 hp, but torque remains unchanged at 311 pound-feet. Front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive are available, with an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission in either case.\nA hybrid powertrain returns as well, again consisting of a 1.6-liter turbo-four engine with an electric motor integrated with a six-speed automatic transmission like the outgoing version. Output has risen to 231 hp and 271 lb-ft of torque, but fuel economy ratings hadn't been confirmed at press time. No announcement has been made yet, but a plug-in hybrid powertrain as in the 2023 Santa Fe may return as well, especially considering that this option continues in the related Kia Sorento.\nUpscale driving experience\nBoring bits can still make for a pleasant driving experience, though. At highway speeds, this Santa Fe Calligraphy test model was remarkably quiet for a non-luxury vehicle. It also rode well despite 21-inch wheels, keeping construction-scarred pavement from ruining our motoring. It begs the question of whether it's worth upgrading to a luxury-brand Lexus RX, let alone supposedly more \"premium\" fare like the Buick Enclave.\nHandling is also on the luxury-vehicle side, in that the Santa Fe prioritizes getting through corners comfortably rather than quickly. That's more appropriate for this vehicle's mission though; fast cornering is only fun for the driver, and this case that person is decisively outnumbered. The suspension also did a good job of keeping body roll in check, and the steering was precise and communicative, making the Santa Fe feel reasonably nimble for a three-row crossover.\nThe turbocharged 2.5-liter engine in this non-hybrid test car was eager to show that four cylinders are enough. Power was delivered in a well-mannered and consistent way, as if Hyundai engineers were still reading old automotive journalist rants about turbo lag while tuning the power band. Unfortunately the turbo-four was let down by the transmission, which had trouble shifting smoothly at low speeds. It simply wouldn't react when pulling away from a stop, creating an uncomfortable pause between throttle application and actual movement.\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe Verdict\nThe Santa Fe is no longer quite the great value that the original version was, but it's not excessively pricy either. A base SE model with front-wheel drive and cloth seats starts at $35,345, while a range-topping leather-upholstered all-wheel drive Calligraphy comes close to $50,000. Prices are up a bit from the previous generation, but well within normal range for this market segment.\nA well-executed interior with lots of small-item storage, as well as an updated infotainment system that finally allows for wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the bigger optional display should make the 2024 Santa Fe easier to live with. Bringing back the third row seems pointless though, except for car shoppers with small children. And the ill-mannered dual-clutch transmission stains what is otherwise a very pleasant driving experience.\nThese details may sway some shoppers to other brands, but many are likely to forget that the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander exist after they're first look at the Hyundai's chiseled visage. Hyundai deserves credit for committing to the bit. Rival crossovers look somewhat rugged but still remind you that they're car-based mall crawlers in the name of authenticity. Hyundai doesn't have a proud off-road heritage to despoil; it can afford to be inauthentic. And if that doesn't work, it can always try something else."

      "text": "The Biggest Transmission Recalls In Recent History\nRegardless of whether you've bought a new car, a washing machine, or a laptop, you might eventually discover potential issues. There are some crucial safety concerns that manufacturers have to bear in mind, and should anything threaten that, even potentially, action has to be taken. Motor vehicles, of course, are particularly vulnerable to this, being effectively a collection of crucial components, any one of which could be deadly if a fault arises.\nThe transmission is one of the most critical elements of all, and any vehicle with transmission issues could cause enormous danger to its driver and others on the road. There are telltale signs that your transmission may be going bad, but sometimes the first drivers know of a potential problem is a vehicle recall. Some only concern a small number of vehicles, while others can be enormous. As such, some of the biggest auto recalls have centered around the transmission of the vehicle in question.\nHere are some of the most extensive recent transmission recalls, how they came about, and which models were affected by them. These transmission problems concern some of the biggest auto manufacturers in the business, and it was incumbent upon them to protect customers by investigating possible issues and resolving them where necessary. Here's how they opted to approach that in these high-profile cases, exactly how many vehicles were included in them, and whether the fix was a simple matter of software or something rather more complex.\nHyundai's troubled month - November 2024: 42,000 vehicles\nRecalls are never exactly welcomed by manufacturers, and sometimes, they can really compound. That was exactly what happened to Hyundai in November 2024, when a transmission recall arrived in the wake of a trio of other recalls. One of these concerned the potentially sub-standard sunshades of some 35,000 Santa Fe SUVs, and was joined by a recall for potentially damaged charging units for the Genesis GV60, GV70, and Ioniq (this one was much more widespread and potentially affected some 145,000 of the vehicles) later that month. The last of that November's recalls from Hyundai concerned an issue with the rearview mirror that delayed or prevented the feed from appearing. 226,000 vehicles were included in this recall.\nJoining all this hubbub was a fourth issue with the marque. This transmission recall, which hit 42,000 Santa Fe and Tucson vehicles, came down to a problem with the wiring. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration underlined that the fault lay with the \"Console Extension Wiring Assembly located near the transmission shift lever that may have been improperly routed during assembly, increasing the risk of contact with the mechanical release for the shift lever lock.\"\nUltimately, this could lead to a situation whereby a vehicle could be \"shifted out of Park without depressing the brake pedal, potentially causing a vehicle rollaway.\" In response, Hyundai offered to adjust the wiring of the affected components for free at dealerships.\nGM's nightmare November 2024: 77,824 vehicles\nNovember 2024, it seems, was quite a bad month for big automakers all around in the transmission stakes. Back with General Motors now, a second recall was issued just days after the one that hit almost half a million models that month. This was a similar, though ultimately unrelated, issue.\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the issue concerned the software of the transmission's control module, which may not react correctly to electronic issues that may occur while the transmission is in action. Per the agency's report, \"[M]iscalibrations can cause harsh shifting or reduced power or may result in unintended deceleration or rear wheel lockup.\" Perhaps most egregiously, it was even possible for the driver to lose control of an affected vehicle to a certain extent, though the report notes that this could occasionally occur at low speeds.\nThis recall was far less widespread than GM's other that month, with the affected vehicles identified as just two different models. The issue mainly affected the 2022-23 Chevrolet Express, of which 54,722 were included. The remainder were GMC Savanas \u2013- the Express' non-Chevy counterpart -\u2013 from the same period. In both cases, only those that included particular engines and transmissions were affected.\nDrivers of affected vehicles could have this rectified at the dealer, where the settings of the control model would be corrected. Thereafter, the transmission would respond as it should to any electrical interruptions during operation.\nGM's November 2020 recall: 194,105 vehicles\nA transmission can be a complex beast indeed, a mechanical wonder made up of a wide range of components big and small. Any one of these components, unfortunately, could lead to a widespread recall. In November 2020, the smallest components of the start/stop transmission accumulator -\u2013 or rather, the potential lack of those components \u2013- caused General Motors to recall almost 200,000 vehicles.\nA total of 12 different models were affected by this recall: Buick's LaCrosse, Enclave, and Encore, Chevrolet's Equinox, Cruze, Blazer, Malibu, and Traverse, GMC's Acadia and Terrain, and the Cadillac XT4 and XT6. All were from the 2018 to 2020 model years. What's particularly interesting about this recall is how the numbers affected are distributed. Just a pair of Buick Encores and seven XT4s were recalled, for instance, while almost two-thirds of the total were Chevy Cruzes alone.\nWhat was potentially wrong with them? The issue, it seems, was yet another software problem, but not one connected to the vehicle itself. Instead, two bolts may not have been applied to the start-stop accumulator at the factory. As a result, transmission oil could leak from it. From faster wear to a loss of control and even a fire, oil leaks can cause no end of trouble for motorists, so dealerships and the supplier committed to replacing the part with one that had a full complement of four bolts and to ensure no further parts were created without them respectively.\nSubaru's December 2021 software issue - 198,255 vehicles affected\nSometimes, a vehicle is recalled for a very specific issue that can cause an equally specific problem. In the case of this Subaru situation from December 2021, that wasn't quite the case. A combination of contemporary and classic motor issues combined in another potentially dangerous transmission issue that warranted a recall.\nThis issue primarily affected the Subaru Ascent, specifically the 2019 and 2020 Ascent. It made up almost 161,000 of the 198,255 recalled, with 2,057 Subaru Legacy units also included. The problem began with the transmission control unit in continuously variable transmission models, which may have a fault, caused by its software, that prevents the drive chain from functioning as it should.\nIt's a danger that Subaru had been grappling with for some time. In 2019, another Subaru recall struck the Ascent. This one was connected to that model year, and wasn't as extensive: 76,842 Ascents were impacted. This one could affect the pressure of the models concerned, cutting it as a result of the pressure sensor having an issue with registering accurate readings. Subaru's proposed fix for the models concerned was a software update, which aimed to ensure accurate readings and so prevent any recurrences.\nFord F-250 and F-350 Super Duty driveshaft damage - 247,445 vehicles\nNow, \"heavy-duty truck\" and \"loss of control\" make for one of the most frightening collections of words that a motorist could imagine. Ford's F-250 and F-350 are formidable vehicles indeed, with the 2024 model of the latter potentially weighing in at upwards of 7,300 lbs. It's big and it's powerful, and it needs to be tamed via equally robust components on the inside. Unfortunately, though, transmission issues are a common F-250 problem, with that model and the F-350 facing a considerable recall in February 2022.\nA total of 247,445 Super Duty vehicles, from the 2017 model year up to 2022, were possibly affected by a problem involving the driveshaft, a critical element of the transmission. A notice issued by Ford in February 2022 explained the problem, which may affect some gas models equipped with an aluminum one-piece driveshaft: \"[U]nderbody insulators may loosen and contact the aluminum driveshaft, resulting in marking or scoring of the driveshaft.\" Though this contact may only cause limited damage at first, it may break the driveshaft over time. The risk is that a broken camshaft could cause other damage to the vehicle, or even, the report went on, make contact with the ground, resulting in a potential loss of control while driving.\nIn response to the issue, Ford announced that all dealers had to inspect and repair all new models involved in the recall, with a potential penalty of $21,000 for every vehicle violating these terms per federal law.\nToyota's Sequoia and Tundra transmission issues- 280,000 vehicles\nThe Toyota brand is well-known for reliability and for the fastidiousness of its design philosophy. However, the Japanese heavyweight has grappled with its share of product recalls too. In February 2024, in the space of a week, four different product recalls were issued by the company, affecting a combined 683,000 Toyotas. The other three recalls issued that month concerned a defective rearview mirror display, a potential hazard with nuts coming loose from the rear axle of the Tacoma, and newer Camry family members from 2023 and 2024 possibly having a fault with the passenger head restraint. The transmission fault saw the recall of 280,000 Sequoia and Tundra vehicles, and it also included vehicles from Toyota's luxury marque, Lexus, which could have been at risk too.\nThe Sequoia and Tundra are a sizable SUV and pickup respectively, while the LX 600 from Lexus is another full-size SUV. There are fundamental differences between the three vehicle families, but they share something important in common: The potential for movement from neutral as a result of the transmission continuing to power the vehicle.\nThe issue was fixable, however, by applying the latest software. That was yet another example of how very convenient it is to be able to apply such updates to modern autos.\nGM's November 2024 transmission fault - 461,839 vehicles\nGM is another auto heavyweight that has run afoul of possible issues with its transmissions, and here's another that would ultimately impact around half a million vehicles. This time, the issue concerned quite a wide range of vehicles: the Cadillac Escalade, the Chevrolet Tahoe and Silverado, and the GMC Yukon and Sierra, from the 2021 to 2022 model years, depending on the vehicle, were prominent among those recalled.\nWhat was the transmission issue this time? These vehicles were potentially vulnerable to a fault that would lock the back wheels. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report stated that a total of 461,839 vehicles may have been affected and that around 4,600 of them were believed to have the problem. Per the report, the issue could be potentially present in diesel models, as they use a different transmission. The NHTSA stated that the automaker had \"previously investigated this condition and determined that, in some applications, excessive wear in a control valve in these transmissions was causing harsh downshifting and, in rare cases, a momentary (<150 ms) lock up of the rear wheels.\"xtagstartz/p>\nFord F-150's transmission woes: 550,000 vehicles\nYou might think that the issuing of a recall could cause an unsightly blot on a reputation. In some cases, this is true. When considering a vehicle like the F-150 truck, though, it seems that precious little can harm that reputation. After all, in 2023, the F-Series celebrated a ludicrous 41 years running as the United States' best-selling vehicle. Even a titan such as this isn't untouchable, though. In fact, its great popularity means that, in the case of an issue, there could be huge numbers of models affected.\nIn June 2024, Consumer Reports noted that more than half a million F-150 pickup trucks from the 2014 model year had been recalled over a transmission issue. The automatic transmissions concerned had the potential to cause the vehicle to drop to first gear unpredictably as a result of signal loss. Those in command of several thousands of pounds of hefty truck, naturally, want to maintain that control of it at all times, and so Ford had to respond decisively to the alarming situation.\nThe potentially affected models, thankfully, represented a limited number of the many F-150s on the roads, being only 2014 models. The recall still hit some 550,000 vehicles, though. If there's some good fortune to be drawn from the deadly danger, it's that Ford was able to implement a software fix to prevent the issue. This was applied to the Powertrain Control Module of the vehicles concerned.\nFord's June 2022 gear shift recall: 2.9 million vehicles\nThe Ford Escape has had its great years and some you might be better off avoiding. It isn't the most unique and stylish vehicle, but it's still a solid entry in the SUV sphere. These are models known for their practicality and capability, but as popular as they are, they're far from immune from recalls. The Escape, in fact, was prominent in one of the biggest recent transmission recalls.\nAround 1,726,763 Escapes, produced between October 2011 and August 2019, were joined by around 1.2 million over Fords -\u2013 the Edge, C-Max, Fusion, and Transit Connect \u2013 produced between 2013 and 2021 in this huge recall. The reason was another pesky, small yet vital component of the transmission: the gear shift.\nAs The New York Times reported, \"the vehicles could have missing or damaged bearings that could prevent them from shifting into gear properly and allow them to move even if the shifter indicates they are in park.\" Why would this situation come about, after the driver had done everything right? \"The bushing that attaches the shift cable to the transmission may degrade or detach,\" the NHTSA report stated. \"A damaged or missing bushing could prevent the shifter from moving the transmission to the intended gear position.\"\nIt was unclear how this component could become damaged, though Ford reportedly noted that factors such as heat could cause the bushing to wear away or become damaged. In response, the automaker pledged to replace the bushing and provide a protective capping for it as needed.\nChevrolet's motor mount issue - 6.7 million\nThe motor mount or engine mount isn't the most glamorous part of a vehicle. It looks like one of those irritating pieces of a flat-pack that you don't quite know what to do with. As is often the case, though, these simple little pieces can tend to be some of the most important, as Chevrolet found out to its detriment in 1971.\nA motor mount lends vital stability to a vehicle's performance, keeping that hard-working engine still and dampening the effects of its actions. This is most certainly not a component that you want sliding around like a piece of luggage, damaging other vital aspects of the vehicle in the process. In December 1971, a recall for millions of Chevy vehicles was confirmed. Affected models included Carnaros, Novas, and some light trucks, all from the 1965 to 1969 model years.\nGeneral Motors president Edward Cole downplayed the issue, with The New York Times of October 19, 1971, quoting Cole as stating that affected vehicles posed \"no real danger and [there's] no reason a person shouldn't drive the car in a normal manner.\" Nonetheless, the very real risk -\u2013 regardless of the likelihood \u2013- of a loss of control caused by a broken motor mount resulted in GM committing to fitting a restraint to the affected models in the case of an issue with the mount, a measure that cost the company an estimated $25-37 million. Still, if you come to think of it, approximately $5 per vehicle isn't bad at all.\nThe potential wide-reaching Ford transmission recall of June 1980 - 16 million vehicles\nOur final case study is a particularly intriguing one. This well-publicized situation didn't officially result in a recall. One was in the offing, though, and Ford was very fortunate to have avoided such a fate in this case. It would have been very financially damaging indeed, given the scale of the problem.\nJune 1980 was an attention-grabbing month for many reasons. This was the month that Tim Berners-Lee built the groundbreaking ENQUIRE program, which utilized a hyperlink system to connect 'nodes' of information. It would evolve into the internet as we know it today. Elsewhere that month, though, the Ford Motor Company was faced with an issue on an enormous scale. It had been determined that Ford vehicles with automatic transmissions of the FMX, JATCO, C-3, C-4, and C-6 variants could potentially slip out of park and begin to reverse.\nHow widespread was the issue? On June 10, 1980, the U.S. government determined that there were possible issues with the transmission systems of 16 million Ford-manufactured vehicles. No official recall was ultimately deemed necessary, as a different solution was reached. Ford emailed 23 million decals to customers, for display in affected vehicles. They highlighted the importance of adjusting and checking the parking brake before switching to park and switching off the ignition."

  "argos_summary": "Hyundai\u2019s 2024 Santa\u202fFe suffered a 100% failure rate in its eight\u2011speed dual\u2011clutch transmission (DCT), prompting a recall of 12,349 vehicles and the discontinuation of the DCT; owners can get a software update or a free transmission replacement. The new Santa\u202fFe sports a bold, Land\u202fRover\u2011inspired exterior, a roomy three\u2011row cabin with abundant storage, a 12.3\u2011inch touchscreen, and wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, but its interior feels more like a budget crossover than a luxury model. While the vehicle offers decent driving dynamics and a strong suite of driver aids, the problematic DCT undermines its overall appeal. The article also highlights other recent high\u2011profile transmission recalls across major automakers, illustrating the broader industry challenge of software and mechanical transmission issues.",
