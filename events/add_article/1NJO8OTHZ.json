      "summary": "Data centers seeking to connect to the PJM Interconnection grid must now provide their own power supply, according to a report from Monitoring Analytics LLC. This recommendation comes as the grid, which spans 13 states, faces a significant strain from the increasing power demands of data centers, leading to higher costs for consumers. The report warns that the current capacity is insufficient to meet future demands, and failure to address this could result in substantial costs for other customers.",
