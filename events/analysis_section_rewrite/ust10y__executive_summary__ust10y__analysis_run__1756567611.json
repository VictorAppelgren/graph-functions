      "feedback": "The draft is already tightly focused on the S&P 500 and contains the required catalyst window (core PCE Sept 10, Fed meeting Sept 16‑17, tariff Aug 29‑31). However, a few sentences drift from a strictly asset‑centric view or lack inline citations that tie the claim directly to the SPX handle. 1) The first sentence (“The spx is poised to climb 0.5–1 % if the Fed cuts 25 bp…”) should include a citation to the source that links a 25‑bp cut to a 0.5–1 % equity lift (e.g., U21K4ALYQ or 97MD1FHW8). 2) The sentence about the 10‑year yield’s 4.30 % ceiling “would likely depress the index by about 100 pts” needs a citation to the source that quantifies the 100‑point sensitivity (e.g., 97MD1FHW8). 3) The risk paragraph mentions “a Supreme Court ruling voiding the tariff plan” – add a citation (1DEM6P1Y2) and explicitly state the causal chain: tariff‑plan void → DXY rise → risk‑off → SPX drop. 4) The watch‑signals sentence should list each catalyst with its ID and keep the sentence concise. 5) Finally, trim the paragraph to 4–6 sentences: start with the base‑case upside, then the 10‑year ceiling, followed by the three key risks, and finish with the watch signals.  Ensure every claim has an inline citation and that the causal chain is explicitly tied to the SPX handle.",
