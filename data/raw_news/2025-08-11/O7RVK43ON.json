  "title": "An Essential Guide To Panama City\u2019s Casco Antiguo, A Burgeoning Hotspot Worth The Trip",
  "description": "Panama City was once just a layover destination, but as travelers finally start to stick around, they\u2019re finding its Casco Antiguo to be the coolest capital in the region.",
  "content": "As sailors come over the crest to pass through the Panama Canal towards Panama City, they\u2019re often surprised to see a skyline packed with skyscrapers, the effect of decades of the country\u2019s stability and strategic location making it the region\u2019s busiest business capital.\n\nPanama City has thrived as a destination for passing through rather than sticking around, with tourism taking a comfortable back seat in the country\u2019s GDP. However, discerning visitors have long known that the seeds of opportunity for transforming this city into a destination all its own have always been there.\n\nNowhere is that more true than in the Casco Antiguo, the city\u2019s historic center dating back to the 1600s, where cathedral bells rings, historic churches reign and centuries-old mansions are finally being reclaimed from the passage of time. While the neighborhood languished for years and many parts lay forgotten, visitors recently started to realize there's something worth seeing here. As new hotels, restaurants, cafes and bar spring up upon hitoric foundations, the neighborhood\u2019s renaissance is igniting Panama City\u2019s tourism like never before.\n\nNow, it\u2019s easier to visit than ever to visit Panama City thanks to Copa Airlines Stopover Program, which allows travels to spend up to seven extra days in Panama when flying the airline, at no additional airline fee.\n\nLooking to beat the crowds and experience Panama City's Casco Antiguo before becomes the new talk of travel? Read on for a guide to the best of Panama City\u2019s most enigmatic neighborhood.\n\nHotel La Compa\u00f1\u00eda marries centuries of history in the heart of the historic center with thoughtful luxuries that makes it part iconic place to stay, part destination all to its own. The hotel's 88 rooms are spread across three wings that each have their roots in different centuries of the history, from 17th-century Spanish colonial section and fine French architecture to Beaux-Arts American inspiration from the 1900s. Multiple dining venues, divine city views and friendly service are next level.\n\nSofitel Legend Casco Viejo got its start in an early 20th-century Club Union building designed by James C. Wright shortly after the opening of the Panama Canal, giving it an instant air of grandeur when it reopened in 2023 as one of the neighborhood\u2019s most historic properties. Now, its luxe waterfront rooms make it a coveted Casco Antiguo spot complete with spa, event spaces and fine dining.\n\nThe age-old mansions of Casco Antiguo are slowly being saved, many transformed into boutique hotels that offer a personalized take on the centuries-old character of neighborhood. Amarla Boutique Hotel is the top choice among them, with handpicked decor in each of its eight rooms, a gorgeous rooftop space, and one of the best restaurants in the entire city.\n\nWhat To Do\n\nTo take a Casco Antiguo walking tour with Ancon Expeditions it to fall in love with tours all over again, even if you haven\u2019t always been their biggest fan. Packed with history and peppered with funny anecdotes, these tours dive into the intricately-layered history of the city, and can be tailored to include a foodie focus, a coffee or chocolate tasting experience and plenty more along the way.\n\nAs a travel writer and coffee addict currently based in Medellin, Colombia I have a pride towards Colombian coffee, but I have to hand it to Panama's prized geisha coffee when it comes to flavor, feel and tasting experience. Geisha tasting opportunities are a dime a dozen in Casco Antiguo, but the best place to try it is with Geisha Experiences, who have a staff of passionate, prepared guides who really know what they\u2019re talking about\n\nA brand new museum located on the edge of the Casco Antiguo, Museo Casa Coronel del Cacao y del Chocolate makes an art of out of Panama's burgeoning chocolate industry, bringing visitors along for the ride\u2014and the taste test. Set in a recently restored historic mansion, a visit is the perfect combination of chocolate tasting experience and historic architectural tour.\n\nIt's all about fine dining, white tablecloth service and delicious handmade fare at Villa Ana 1928, once the home of one of Panama City\u2019s most famous society ladies and now a multi-level restaurant and bar space complete with cigar bar and rooftop. Make sure to time your visit for a night of live music to be immediately transports you back to one of Panama City\u2019s most regal eras.\n\nIt seemed every local I spoke with in Panama City was set on sending me to Fonda Lo Que Hay during my stay in Casco Antiguo. Named one of the best restaurants in Latin America after its debut, this casual spot with a cool bar and plenty of family-style seating ushers guests into the most authentic yet elevated Panamanian dining destinations in the neighborhood. Affordable prices and rave reviews means you might have to wait for a table.\n\nPanamanian cuisine is going through something of a renaissance, led in no small part by passionate chefs like Jose Aparicio at Kaandela. An up and coming local chef calls his creations a mix of \"Panama\u2019s culinary traditions reinterpreted with a modern edge,\" offers a good mix of surf and turf options with plenty of Caribbean flavor and flare.\n\nNestled off the courtyard in the French wing of Hotel La Compa\u00f1\u00eda, Exilio Bar oozes a grandeur and stately luxury that draws Panama City's elite into Casco Antiguo for drinks to close the day. It preserves the history of its locale without being ostentatious, and is perfectly balanced by taking a second round of drinks at the hotel\u2019s rooftop bar at sunset.\n\nPedro Mandinga is first and foremost a rum distillery and brand with a variety of thoughtfully crafted liquors, so you know its Pedro Mandinga Rum Bar in Casco Antiguo has to be good. You really can't go wrong with anything on their full menu of food (though the patacones and torrejitas are divine), but guests can't leave without a tasting of their unique rums distilled with ingredients like geisha coffee, cacao and coconut.\n\nCasco Antiguo is all about the rooftops, and there's none better than T\u00e1ntalo if you\u2019re looking to get down. T\u00e1ntalo tends to have a mix of visitors and locals alike here to gawk at the incredible view of both old town streets and modern city skyscrapers.There\u2019s a fun drink menu and full menu of food served until the evening, though the party goes on into the wee hours.\n\nAn impossibly cool design store located on Casco Antiguo's Calle de los Sombreros, Monsters is packed with colorfully designed, Panama inspired t-shirts, jewelry, stickers, home decor pieces and so much more, making it the perfect stop for a one of a kind souvenir. Here you'll want to linger: the shop shares space with a matcha cafe and tea house to fuel the rest of your Casco Antiguo adventures.\n\nA curated collection of lightweight, resort ware style-clothes, bags and accessories will draw you into Etnik, but just wait until you see the jewelry. Locally designed fine jewelry takes inspiration from pre-Columbian indigenous discoveries and long-loved textile designs for handcrafted pieces that make a statement.\n\nPanama hats actually originated in Ecuador, but they got their name when President Theodore Roosevelt wore one when he visited Panama City during the construction of the Panama Canal. Now, you'll find them for sale everywhere, but Victor\u2019s Panama Hats does a great job offering a wide range or hand-produced hats you\u2019ll love, and will happy walk clients through their creation process from start to finish.",

Una de las tendencias que ha ido ganando terreno en los \u00faltimos tiempos es la ropa estampada con motivos de casino. Esta peculiar y arriesgada elecci\u00f3n de dise\u00f1o ha capturado la imaginaci\u00f3n de los amantes de la moda y los juegos de azar por igual que les gusta jugar en casinos en l\u00ednea en Per\u00fa https://cantorodado.pe/. Exploraremos la creciente popularidad y la originalidad que rodea a esta tendencia \u00fanica.\nEl Auge de la Ropa Estampada de Casino\nLa ropa estampada de casino se ha convertido en un fen\u00f3meno en la moda contempor\u00e1nea. Su popularidad se debe en parte a su capacidad para combinar dos mundos aparentemente dispares: el glamour y la emoci\u00f3n de los casinos con la individualidad y creatividad de la moda personal. Los motivos de cartas de juego, dados, ruletas y fichas se imprimen en camisetas, vestidos, sudaderas y accesorios, agregando un toque de excentricidad y atrevimiento a la vestimenta cotidiana.\nOriginalidad en Cada Dise\u00f1o\nLo que realmente distingue a la ropa estampada de casino es su originalidad intr\u00ednseca. Cada dise\u00f1o cuenta una historia y evoca una sensaci\u00f3n \u00fanica. La elecci\u00f3n de utilizar iconograf\u00eda de casino como estampado muestra una inclinaci\u00f3n hacia la audacia y la autoexpresi\u00f3n. Los amantes de esta tendencia no solo est\u00e1n abrazando la moda, sino que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n adoptando un estilo de vida que refleja la emoci\u00f3n y la camarader\u00eda que se encuentra en los casinos.\nLa ropa estampada de casino es mucho m\u00e1s que una simple tendencia de moda: es una declaraci\u00f3n de originalidad y un gui\u00f1o a la emoci\u00f3n de los juegos de azar. Esta combinaci\u00f3n \u00fanica ha capturado la imaginaci\u00f3n de aquellos que buscan destacarse y expresar su estilo de manera audaz. Ya sea un gui\u00f1o a la cultura pop o una elecci\u00f3n de dise\u00f1o personal, la ropa estampada de casino sigue ganando terreno en el mundo de la moda y demostrando que la autenticidad y la originalidad siempre est\u00e1n de moda.\nTestimonios\n\u201cMonsters es lo m\u00e1ximo.!
