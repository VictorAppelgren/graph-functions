  "title": "Scientists discover how to 'reverse' memory loss and keep brain young",
  "description": "Groundbreaking research suggests that reversing memory loss may be achievable by restoring the balance of a common elemental protein in the brain.",
  "content": "Researchers have reversed memory loss in aging mice by targeting a protein that builds up in brain cells, pointing toward a potential pathway to counter the cognitive declines of aging.\n\nIn a new study, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, examined a protein called ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), which was found to accumulate in the brain's memory center as mice aged.\n\nWhen they artificially increased the protein in young mice, the animals developed memory impairments. But when they reduced its levels in older mice, their cognitive performance was boosted to levels seen in much younger mice.\n\nThe protein is believed to disrupt energy production within cells, essentially starving neurons of the power needed to form and store memories.\n\nFTL1 is linked to normal, age-related memory decline, which includes common cognitive changes that affect nearly everyone as they get older, even without a disease like Alzheimer's. Focusing on this protein represents a much larger segment of the aging population.\n\nDr Saul Villeda, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, said: \u2018It is truly a reversal of impairments. It\u2019s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms.\n\nUnderstanding how aging alters brain cells and molecules is crucial to explaining why some people develop neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia.\n\nBetween six and 12 million Americans 65 and up have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia. About a third of those people develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease within five years.\n\nUsing specialized genetic tools and viruses, the scientists either increased or decreased the levels of the FTL1 protein - which is part of the body's system that stores iron in cells - in the mice's brains, specifically in the brain\u2019s memory center.\n\nThey put the mice through various memory and learning tests, such as mazes and recognizing new objects, to see how these changes affected their cognitive abilities.\n\nAfter the tests, they examined the mouse brain tissue under microscopes, counting how many connections between brain cells were lost or regained.\n\nThey then measured if the brain cells were generating enough energy to function properly and used dyes to see how iron was being stored in the brain cells.\n\nResearchers found that levels of the FTL1 protein were significantly higher in the memory center of old mice compared to young mice. The higher the FTL1 levels in old mice, the worse they performed on memory tests.\n\nWhen scientists artificially increased FTL1 in young, healthy mice, it made them forgetful. They performed just as poorly on memory tests as old mice.\n\nBut when they reduced FTL1 levels in old, forgetful mice, their memory dramatically improved. They started performing like young mice again.\n\nRepeat experiments proved their results were not a fluke. Multiple trial rounds, using different genetic approaches to reduce FTL1, consistently produced the same outcome.\n\nThey published their findings in the journal Nature Aging.\n\nWhile the findings are promising, the authors cautioned that the research was conducted only in male mice and that human applications remain in the distance.\n\nA process that successfully reverses memory decline in a mouse's brain may not work the same way, or at all, in the far more complex human brain.\n\nDementia research has traditionally centered on beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which are known to accumulate in the brain and form clumps and tangles.\n\nThe harmful buildup of proteins is exacerbated as the aging brain loses its natural ability to dispose of metabolic waste.\n\nThis research significantly broadens the potential pool of people who could benefit from the findings.\n\nAmyloid and Tau research primarily aims to treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease, but not everyone who ages will get Alzheimer's.\n\nBut for thousands of people today, the reality of cognitive decline is a present and devastating diagnosis.\n\nRebecca, a 48-year-old single mother from British Columbia, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's after months of debilitating cognitive symptoms that disrupted her daily life.\n\nShe experienced severe memory lapses, most notably forgetting names and mid-conversation blackouts where she would suddenly lose her train of thought entirely.\n\nThe episodes progressed beyond simple forgetfulness to a profound inability to process information, such as opening her work laptop and having 'zero idea how to do my job,' even when looking at her own training notes.\n\nMeanwhile, Jana Nelson's diagnosis of early-onset dementia at age 50 was preceded by severe personality changes, going from a laid-back woman to being short-tempered with extreme, unmanageable mood swings.\n\nHer cognitive abilities sharply declined, manifesting as an inability to solve simple math problems like calculating change from five dollars or name different colors. She became unsteady on her feet, began to repeat herself, and struggled profoundly with problem-solving tasks and spatial reasoning, such as fitting a key into a shaped hole or drawing a clock face.\n\nFTL1 research aims to address the mechanisms behind the general, age-related memory decline that affects nearly everyone, even younger adults who begin to experience memory lapses.\n\nDr Villeda said: \u2018We\u2019re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It\u2019s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging.\u2019",

      "text": "Abstract\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases1,2. We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level1,10. Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain1,11, to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction12,13,14,15. Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus\u2014a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging11,13\u2014using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN+ nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain sufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons16 (Fig. 1d).\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1)17,18,19 (Fig. 1e\u2013g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance (Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) states20. Fe2+ and Fe3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations14, we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity14. Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f\u2013i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired, demonstrating no preference (Fig. 2h,i). As a control, we profiled general health using an open-field paradigm and observed no differences in overall activity, total distance traveled or time spent in the center of the open field, indicative of normal motor and anxiety functions (Extended Data Fig. 3d\u2013f). Our functional data indicate that mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 negatively regulates synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory.\nTo begin to investigate the converse effect of abrogating neuronal Ftl1, we used a complementary viral-mediated RNA interference in vitro approach. Primary neurons were infected with lentivirus encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting Ftl1 (sh-Ftl1) or luciferase control (sh-Luc) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013c). Decreased neuronal FTL1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c) resulted in an increase in total neurite length as well as in dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 3a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under RNA interference conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e).\nNext, we sought to explore the potential benefit of targeting the age-related increase of FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice. We performed targeted stereotaxic injections of a high-titer virus encoding shRNA sequences targeting either Ftl1 or luciferase control into the CA1 and dentate gyrus hippocampal regions of aged mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Abrogation of FTL1 was validated by western blot (Fig. 3b). We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis, and, in contrast to the effects observed with FTL1 overexpression, targeting Ftl1 led to an increase in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses in the aged hippocampus (Fig. 3c,d). Additionally, we observed an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Functionally, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 knockdown (Fig. 3e). Consistent with age-related cognitive decline, control aged mice showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, abrogating FTL1 in the aged hippocampus resulted in cognitive improvements (Fig. 3f,g). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d\u2013f). These data suggest that targeting hippocampal FTL1 restores known age-related synaptic molecular changes and cognitive function in aged mice.\nTo determine the effect of selectively targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we generated aged, temporally controlled, neuron-specific conditional Ftl1 genetic knockout mice (FTL1 cKO) using a viral-mediated in vivo CRISPR\u2013Cas9 approach by delivering high-titer lentivirus encoding a synapsin-driven Cre and guide RNA sequences into aged inducible Cas9 transgenic mice (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Decreased FTL1 levels were validated by western blot (Fig. 3h). We observed an increase in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot in the hippocampus of aged FTL1 cKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 3i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged FTL1 cKO mice (Fig. 3k). Consistent with abrogation of hippocampal FTL1, selectively targeting neuronal Ftl1 resulted in cognitive improvements in memory in FTL1 cKO mice compared to control mice (Fig. 3l,m). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013f). These behavioral data indicate that targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age mitigates age-related cognitive impairments.\nTo identify potential mechanisms underlying the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function, we characterized the transcriptomes of hippocampal neurons from young and aged mice after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression and abrogation, respectively, by neuronal nuclei RNA-seq approaches (Fig. 4a,d). We detected 100 differentially expressed genes in young mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 and 309 differentially expressed genes in aged mice after hippocampal FTL1 knockdown compared to control conditions (Fig. 4b,e and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We performed Gene Ontology analysis and identified changes in energy metabolism pathways and synaptic processes (Fig. 4c,f). To gain further regional and cell-type-specific resolution, we assessed molecular changes elicited by viral-mediated Ftl1 knockout by single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g). Cell clusters were identified using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach and projected by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) onto a two-dimensional plot (Fig. 4h). Signatures of each cluster were generated by differential gene expression analysis to compare clusters. Cell types were established based on transcriptomic signatures, and populations were compared across genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 7). We performed bioinformatics analysis on excitatory hippocampal neurons, and Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between FTL1 cKO and control mice identified predominantly metabolic processes (Fig. 4i). Concordantly, we observed increased expression of genes related to aerobic respiration and proton-driven ATP synthesis in excitatory neurons of FTL1 cKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013d). Next, we analyzed clusters of CA1 pyramidal neurons, CA2/CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cell neurons separately (Fig. 4j\u2013l). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation and NADH across hippocampal neuronal cell types (Fig. 4j\u2013l).\nLeveraging our transcriptomic analysis, we next surveyed our in vivo neuronal FTL1 overexpression RNA-seq (Fig. 4a), in vivo neuronal Ftl1 RNA interference RNA-seq (Fig. 4d) and in vivo Ftl1 cKO single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g) datasets for convergent molecular pathways. Of the genes that are downregulated in the young hippocampus after increased neuronal FTL1 and upregulated in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1, we detected 32 genes that were bidirectionally changed (Fig. 4m and Supplementary Table 6). Gene Ontology analysis of this gene set identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4n), with restored neuronal expression of genes including Sdhb, Atp5o, Atp5c1, Ndufa10 and Atp5j in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1 (Fig. 4o). To corroborate our RNA-seq findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured neuronal ATP production rate by Seahorse assay after viral-mediated overexpression and abrogation of FTL1 in primary neurons. Increasing neuronal FTL1 significantly compromised ATP production (Fig. 4p), whereas abrogation of FTL1 resulted in increased ATP production compared to control conditions (Fig. 4q).\nConsequently, we reasoned that boosting metabolic function might counter the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1. To begin to test this possibility, primary neurons were treated with NADH (a coenzyme driving ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation)21,22,23 after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 4r and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Consistent with our previous observation, we detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 4r); however, this decrease was mitigated after NADH treatment (Fig. 4r). No changes in neuronal toxicity were observed (Extended Data Fig. 9b). To investigate the effect of NADH supplementation on cognitive function, young adult mice were administered NADH after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression, and hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed by NOR and Y maze (Fig. 4s). Although young mice with increased neuronal FTL1 expression showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm, these cognitive deficits were mitigated after NADH supplementation (Fig. 4t,u). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 10a\u2013d). These transcriptomics and behavioral data indicate that the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function are mediated, at least in part, through alterations in metabolic processes.\nCumulatively, our study elucidates a previously unrecognized role for neuronal FTL1 in the progression of aging-associated cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice promotes synaptic changes and cognitive impairments indicative of hippocampal aging. Conversely, targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 reverses synaptic changes and restores hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Mechanistically, we implicate changes in metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP production, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 and demonstrate that boosting metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigates these pro-aging effects on cognition. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the molecular underpinnings of cognitive aging and identify neuronal FTL1 as a potential therapeutic target to counter age-related cognitive dysfunction.\nFTL1 comprises the light chain of ferritin and is involved in the long-term storage of iron. Disruption in iron metabolism is known to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent alterations in metabolic processes24\u2014a key hallmark of the aging process25,26. Age-related increased levels of neuronal FTL1 detected in the hippocampus are likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging. This is congruent with our neuronal RNA-seq analysis pointing to altered metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP synthesis, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function. This link is further bolstered by recent reports that increasing metabolic function by supplementation with NAD+ and its precursors confers cognitive benefits in aged rodents27,28,29, similar to the effects that we observed with NADH in the context of increased neuronal FTL1.\nExcess iron and its abnormal redox cycling can also lead to ferroptosis30,31, an iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease32,33. Ferroptosis was previously characterized using Fe2+-specific and Fe3+-specific DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors, triggering an increase in both Fe2+ or Fe3+ as well as a concomitant decrease in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio20. The observed decrease in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio resulting from ferroptosis is distinct from the increase observed after neuronal FTL1 overexpression in the hippocampus. These contrasting observations are likely reflective of key differences between normal aging in the absence of gross neuronal death and neurodegenerative disease conditions in which ferroptosis is observed.\nAlterations in mitochondria dynamics are likewise widely reported in the brain during aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with structural effects to the mitochondrial inner membrane disrupting the electron transport system by modifying the available surface area necessary for ATP synthesis to occur34,35. Both bulk neuronal RNA-seq and single-nuclei RNA-seq after overexpression and abrogation of neuronal Ftl1 point toward changes in the electron transport system linked to potential structural modifications in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Indeed, Gene Ontology analysis of bidirectional, differentially expressed genes indicates fluctuations in proton-motive force, implicating changes in electron transport through complexes I, II and IV that are coupled to electrogenic proton ejection across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These transcriptional analyses are further bolstered by in vitro Seahorse analysis, demonstrating altered ATP production after FTL1 manipulation in primary neurons. Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1.\nFrom a translational perspective, aging is the most dominant risk factor for age-related neurodegenerative disorders2,36,37 such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Of note, mutations in the Ftl1 gene result in neuroferritinopathy\u2014a rare inherited late-onset monogenic neurodegenerative disorder associated with movement disorders, dystonia and cognitive impairments38,39,40. Moreover, longitudinal studies of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease showed that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively associated with cognitive performance over 7 years and predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer\u2019s disease41. Thus, our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people.\nMethods\nAnimal models\nThe following mouse lines were used: C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, line 000664), C57BL/6 aged mice (National Institutes of Aging) and B6;129-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP)Fezh/J (The Jackson Laboratory, line 024857). All studies were done in young (2\u20133 months) or aged (18\u201322 months) male mice that were not involved in any previous procedures. The numbers of mice used to result in statistically significant differences were calculated using standard power calculations with \u03b1 = 0.05 and a power of 0.8. We used an online tool (https://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html) to calculate power and sample size based on experience with the respective tests, variability of the assays and inter-individual differences within groups. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with humidity maintained at 30\u201370% and temperature at 68\u201379 \u00b0F (20\u201326 \u00b0C). All animal handling and use were in accordance with institutional guidelines approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nTissue collection\nMice were anesthetized with 87.5 mg kg\u22121 ketamine and 12.5 mg kg\u22121 xylazine and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Tissues were removed and processed for subsequent analysis. To process the brains, either the hippocampus was subdissected and snap frozen or the whole brain was fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) at 4 \u00b0C for 48 hours before cryoprotection with 30% sucrose.\nPrimary neuron cultures\nHippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated from E17 C57Bl/6J mouse embryos using the papain dissociation system (Worthington, cat. no. LK003153). Cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well on 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Carolina, cat. no. 633009) in 24-well plates. Cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 in neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 21103049) supplemented with B-27 (cat. no. 17504044), GlutaMAX (cat. no. 35050061) and penicillin\u2013streptomycin (cat. no. 15140122). Media were partially changed every 4\u20135 days. On day in vitro 8 (DIV8), neurons were infected with lentivirus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1 and processed 10 days later (DIV18) for immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 minutes), washed and stained with MAP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. M1406, RRID: AB_477171), anti-GFP (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020) or anti-turboGFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. PA5\u201322688, RRID: AB_2540616) antibodies to confirm infection, along with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. H3570) for nuclear staining.\nViral plasmids and viruses\nLentiviral constructs for Ftl1 overexpression, knockdown and conditional knockout were generated using standard molecular cloning techniques. For overexpression, murine Ftl1 coding sequence (with partial untranslated regions) was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified from adult mouse hippocampal cDNA and cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. K240020), sequence verified and subcloned into a synapsin\u2013IRES\u2013eGFP lentiviral backbone using NheI and EcoRI. The synapsin\u2013IRES\u2013eGFP plasmid alone served as control. For knockdown, shRNAs targeting Ftl1 (SH1\u2013SH4) were cloned into the pGreenPuro system (System Biosciences), with a luciferase-targeting shRNA as control15,42. For CRISPR-based knockout vectors, six gRNAs targeting Ftl1 exons 2\u20134 were designed using CHOPCHOP43 and cloned into LentiCRISPR v2 (ref. 44). gRNA sequences included CGTATTTGTAACCTCCCGCA and CGCAGACTGGCGCGCCCCAG, among others. A non-targeting gRNA (GGCGAGGGCGATGCCACCTA) served as control. Validated gRNA sequences were subcloned into a Syn1-Cre lentiviral vector (Addgene, no. 68841; ref. 45) using PacI and NheI/XbaI. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Lentivirus production followed previously described protocols46. Ftl1 expression changes were confirmed by qRT\u2013PCR and western blot in mouse cells.\nLentivirus production\nHEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, cat. no. CRL-11268) were transfected using a 4:3:1-\u00b5g ratio of lentiviral construct, psPAX2 (Addgene, no. 12260, gift from D. Trono) and pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene, no. 8454, RRID: Addgene_8454)47. After 48 hours, supernatants were cleared by centrifugation (5 minutes, 1,000g) and filtration (0.45 \u03bcm) and then concentrated by ultracentrifugation (24,000 r.p.m, 1.5 hours). Pellets were resuspended in PBS. Primary neurons were infected at MOI = 1. For in vivo injections, viral solutions were diluted to 1.0 \u00d7 108 viral particles per milliliter (vp/ml).\nConfocal imaging and quantification\nFor hippocampal synaptic proteins, confocal images were acquired on an LSM 900 microscope (Zeiss) with a \u00d763 objective as z stacks (16 optical sections, 0.33-\u00b5m step size) per sample. Maximum intensity projections were generated for individual puncta analysis. Synapsin (555 nm) and gephyrin or PSD95 (647 nm) were quantified using the Analysis module. For co-localization, z stacks were split into four approximately 1-\u00b5m sub-stacks, each projected to two dimensions. Co-localization was assessed using the ZEN Toolkit 3D. For primary cell cultures, confocal z stacks (12 sections, 0.80-\u00b5m step) were acquired on an LSM 900 microscope (Zeiss) using a \u00d720 objective. Neurite length was quantified with NeuronJ (version 1.4.3) and imagescience.jar in FIJI (ImageJ version 1.54f). Sholl analysis was performed using the Simple Neurite Tracer in the Neuroanatomy plugin. Concentric rings (10-\u00b5m spacing, up to 300 \u00b5m) centered on the soma were used to quantify dendrite complexity by counting neurite intersections, which were summed to calculate total arborization and plotted as a function of distance.\nReal-time ATP rate using Seahorse\nMitochondrial ATP production was assessed in primary neurons (75,000 cells per well) using the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Cells were plated on Seahorse 24-well plates pre-coated with 50 \u03bcl of poly-l-lysine (10 \u00b5g ml\u22121; Millipore, cat. no. A-005-C) after Ftl1 overexpression or knockdown. On the day of the assay, cells were equilibrated for 1 hour in Seahorse assay medium (DMEM supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine; Agilent Technologies). ATP production was measured using sequential injections of 1.5 \u00b5M oligomycin and 0.5 \u00b5M rotenone/antimycin (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 103592-100).\nStereotaxic injections\nProcedures were adapted from Lin et al.46. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen (2 l min\u22121) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to prevent corneal drying, and fur over the skull was trimmed. Adeno-associated virus solutions (1.0 \u00d7 108 vp/ml) were bilaterally injected into the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus at the following coordinates (from bregma: AP: \u22122.0 mm, ML: \u00b11.5 mm; from skull surface: DV: \u22121.8 mm and \u22122.1 mm) using a 5-\u03bcl 26s-gauge Hamilton syringe. A volume of 2 \u03bcl per site was infused over 10 minutes (0.2 \u03bcl min\u22121). To minimize backflow, the needle was left in place for 8 minutes after injection and then partially retracted and held for another 2 minutes. Incisions were closed with silk sutures and VetBond. Mice received subcutaneous saline, enrofloxacin, carprofen and buprenorphine postoperatively and were monitored during recovery.\nNeuronal nuclei isolation\nNeuronal nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen hippocampi following a modified version of Krishnaswami et al.48. Tissue was homogenized in 750 \u03bcl of ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 \u03bcM DTT, RNase and protease inhibitors) using a dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, cat. no. 357538; 12 loose and 20 tight pestle strokes). Homogenates were passed through a 40-\u03bcm filter and centrifuged (500 relative centrifugal force (RCF), 6 minutes, 4 \u00b0C) and then washed and pelleted again under the same conditions. Pellets were resuspended in staining buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS) and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-NeuN antibody (Millipore, cat. no. MAB377X, RRID: AB_2149209) was added at 1:250, and samples were rotated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 hour. After two washes in staining buffer, Hoechst 33342 was added (0.01 \u03bcg ml\u22121), and samples were filtered through 35-\u03bcm mesh FACS tubes prior to sorting.\nNuclei isolation for single-nucleus RNA-seq\nNeuronal nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen hippocampi using a modified version of the 10x Genomics protocol. Tissue was homogenized in 500 \u03bcl of NP-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40 substitute, 1 mM DTT and RNase inhibitor) with 20 loose and 25 tight pestle strokes (Wheaton, cat. no. 357538), followed by the addition of another 500 \u03bcl of buffer and 7-minute incubation on ice. Homogenates were filtered (40 \u03bcm) and centrifuged (500 RCF, 5 minutes, 4 \u00b0C) and then washed in PBS with 1% BSA and RNase inhibitor. After another spin, samples were resuspended in 400 \u03bcl of wash buffer containing Hoechst 33342 (1:10,000), incubated for 5 minutes on ice, filtered through 35-\u03bcm mesh and sorted using a BD FACSAria II.\nFACS\nNuclei were sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion with a 70-\u03bcm nozzle and a flow rate of 1\u20132.5 ml min\u22121. Nuclei were first gated by forward and side scatter and then gated for doublets with height and width. Nuclei that were both Hoechst+ and NeuN+ (neuronal nuclei isolation) or only Hoechst+ (single-nucleus isolation) were sorted into TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, T9424) for RNA analysis.\nLibrary generation and RNA-seq\nRNA-seq libraries were generated using a modified Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al.49). After RNA isolation with TRI Reagent, 8 ng of high-quality RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 18064-014) with anchored poly-dT and TSO primers. cDNA was amplified (10 PCR cycles) using KAPA HiFi HotStart polymerase (cat. no. KK2601) and purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A63881). Quality was assessed by Qubit fluorometry. For library construction, 2 ng of cDNA was fragmented (approximately 500 bp) with Nextera Tn5 transposase (Illumina, cat. no. FC-131-1096) and PCR amplified (12 cycles) with indexed Nextera primers (Illumina, cat. no. FC-131-1002). Final libraries were bead purified, analyzed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq (paired-end 2 \u00d7 150 bp, SP flow cell).\nRNA-seq analysis\nReads were aligned to the mm10 mouse transcriptome using STAR version 2.7.3a50 with ENCODE-recommended settings. Gene-level quantification was performed with RSEM version 1.3.1 (ref. 51), and differential expression analysis was carried out in R version 4.0.2 using DESeq2 version 1.28.1 (ref. 52). Full pipeline details (version 2.1.2) are available at https://github.com/emc2cube/Bioinformatics/. Gene Ontology enrichment was performed using Panther.\nSingle-nuclei RNA-seq analysis\nNuclei were submitted to the UCSF IHG Genomics Core for processing with the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 kit. Approximately 10,000 nuclei per sample were captured, and cDNA libraries were prepared following manufacturer protocols (10x Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2. Base calls were demultiplexed using Cell Ranger version 7.1, and raw FASTQ files were processed to generate expression matrices, including intronic reads. Each sample yielded approximately 13,100\u201315,950 nuclei, with a mean depth of 27,000 reads per nucleus and approximately 44% sequencing saturation. Data were analyzed in R version 4.2.2. Ambient RNA contamination was removed using SoupX, and samples were integrated with Seurat (2,000 variable genes, 20 dimensions). Nuclei expressing fewer than 300 or more than 5,000 genes, or more than 2% mitochondrial transcripts, were excluded. Genes detected in fewer than three nuclei were filtered out. Doublets and technical artifacts were removed, and expression was log normalized. Dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA, and clustering was conducted with the Louvain algorithm on the first 20 principal components. UMAP was applied for two-dimensional visualization. Differential expression was calculated using Seurat (min.pct = 0.05, log fold change > 0.15, pseudocount = 0.1). Genes inconsistent across replicates were excluded. Visualizations included violin plots, UMAPs and heatmaps from average expression matrices. Volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano.\nSynaptosomes protein sample preparation\nTo obtain sufficient synaptosomes for proteomic analysis, hippocampus and cortex from multiple mice were pooled. Synaptosomes were isolated following a modified protocol from Trinidad et al.53. Tissue was homogenized in sucrose buffer with phosphatase inhibitors (Na3VO4, NaF, Na2MoO4, sodium tartrate, fenvalerate and okadaic acid) and PUGNAc, followed by differential centrifugation. Synaptic membranes were collected at the 1.0\u20131.2 M sucrose interface and pelleted. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II/III and PUGNAc. Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample (1.5 mg) was reduced with 2.5 mM TCEP at 56 \u00b0C for 1 hour, alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide (45 minutes, room temperature, dark), diluted to 1 M guanidine and digested overnight at 37 \u00b0C with sequencing-grade trypsin (1:50 enzyme:substrate). Peptides were acidified with formic acid, desalted (C18 Sep-Pak) and dried by SpeedVac. Tryptic peptides were labeled with TMT-6plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol: TMT126\u2013131 for three young and three aged samples. Labeling efficiency was confirmed on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap. Labeled peptides were quenched with 5% hydroxylamine, pooled, desalted and dried. Peptides were separated using high-pH reverse-phase chromatography on a Gemini 5-\u03bcm C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 150 mm; Phenomenex). A 9\u201349% acetonitrile gradient in 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) was run over 20 ml at 550 \u03bcl min\u22121, collecting 60 fractions. Fractions were combined (two per sample) into 12 final samples and dried for downstream analysis.\nMass spectrometry analysis\nTandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were separated on a 50-cm \u00d7 75-\u03bcm ID, 2-\u03bcm C18 EASY-Spray column using a linear gradient from 3.5% to 30% solvent B over 185 minutes. MS1 scans were acquired from 375 m/z to 1,500 m/z at 120,000 resolution (AGC target: 4.0 \u00d7 105). Ions with charge states 2\u20137 were selected using a 1.0-m/z window, with dynamic exclusion (30 seconds) and MIPS filtering enabled. Higher-energy collisional dissociation MS2 spectra were acquired using stepped collision energies (30%/35%/40%) and detected in the Orbitrap at 30,000 resolution (AGC: 5.0 \u00d7 104; maximum injection time: 100 ms). The scan cycle was set to 3 seconds. Peaklists were generated using Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 and searched against the SwissProt Mus musculus database (downloaded 6 September 2016, with decoy sequences) using Protein Prospector version 5.21.1. Searches assumed trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages. Fixed modifications included carbamidomethylation (Cys) and TMT-6plex labels (Lys and N termini); variable modifications included N-terminal acetylation, oxidation (Met), pyro-glutamate formation (Gln) and N-terminal Met loss (with or without acetylation). A maximum of two variable modifications per peptide was allowed. Identifications were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate at both peptide and protein levels.\nTMT mass spectrometry data analysis\nData were filtered to only include peptides unique to a single protein. Quantitation of TMT data was performed by calculating ratios of reporter ion peak intensities between conditions along with variance for each ratio and median normalized. Protein abundances were normalized by the median of ratio distributions. The age-dependent changes were determined using a normalized median log2 Aged/Young ratio of at least 1.0, corresponding to a 2.0 fold change with age and a \u2212log10 P value greater than 1.3.\nRT\u2013qPCR\nTo quantify mRNA expression levels, equal amounts of cDNA were synthesized using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4368813) and then mixed with SYBR Fast mix (Kapa Biosystems) and primers. \u03b2-actin was amplified as an internal control. RT\u2013qPCR was performed in the CFX384 Real Time System (Bio-Rad). Each sample and primer set was run in triplicate, and relative expression levels were calculated using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blotting was performed on both mouse hippocampal tissue and primary hippocampal neurons. For tissue studies, hippocampi were dissected, flash frozen and pulverized prior to lysis in RIPA buffer (Abcam, ab156034) with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 4693116001). Lysates were mixed with 4\u00d7 LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, NP0008), resolved by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245, 1:5,000), \u03b2-tubulin (Covance, MMS-435P, 1:1,000), NR2A (Sigma-Aldrich, 07-632, 1:1,000), synapsin (Abcam, ab18814, 1:1,000) and AMPA receptor (Abcam, ab109450, 1:3,000). HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A15999, 1:2,000) and anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare, NA934V, 1:2,000) secondaries were used for detection with ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Signals were imaged with a ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad) and quantified in FIJI/ImageJ (version 2.0.0).\nFor cell-based experiments, primary neurons were cultured from E17 mouse embryos, treated as indicated, lysed under the same conditions and processed in parallel. Quantification was normalized to loading controls (GAPDH, \u03b2-tubulin or \u03b2-actin) and to the control group. Each tissue datapoint represents an individual animal; each cell culture datapoint represents a biological replicate. Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-tests.\nIron quantification\nIron imaging was performed using a modified protocol from Wu et al.20. Mouse brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (24 hours, 4 \u00b0C), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (3 days) and sectioned coronally at 30-\u03bcm thickness using a cryostat. Slices were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in cryoprotectant. For each group, three sections from six mice per cohort were stained with technical replicates. Sections were rinsed in TBS (3\u00d7, 5 minutes), blocked in 2% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with anti-GFP antibody (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020, 1:250). After washing, samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 703-545-155, 1:250) for 2 hours at room temperature. Excess antibodies were removed with TBS washes. To detect Fe2+ and Fe3+ simultaneously, DNAzyme-based sensors were used. Active and inactive enzyme (E/iE) strands (2 \u03bcM) and substrate strands (2.2 \u03bcM) were annealed in Bis-Tris buffer (5 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6), 40 mM sodium acetate, 200 mM NaCl) by heating to 95 \u00b0C and cooling to room temperature. Fe(II)-H5 and Fe(III)-B12 sensors were combined 1:1 with Hoechst. Brain slices were rinsed in Bis-Tris-acetate buffer, incubated in the sensor mix for 30 minutes and then washed and treated with 0.5\u00d7 TrueBlack Lipofuscin Quencher (Biotium, PSF006) in 70% ethanol for 30 seconds. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and imaged using a Nikon spinning disk or Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a \u00d720 objective. Channels used included 405 nm (Hoechst), 488 nm (GFP), 546 nm (Fe2+) and 647 nm (Fe3+). z stacks (four steps, 5-\u03bcm intervals) covering the hippocampus were acquired via tiled scan. Images were analyzed in ImageJ; maximum intensity projections were used. Background correction was done by subtracting the average signal from inactive sensor (iErS) controls in the same region (CA1, CA2/CA3 or dentate gyrus).\nDNAzyme sequences\nFe(II)-H5\n-\naE:/5IAbRQ/TGGATATCTCCTAGCCAGACTGTTATGTGTGATACGGCAAACTTCGTGATGCCTCTACGGGTCCG\n-\niE:/5IAbRQ/TGGATATCTCCTAGTCAGACTGTTATGTGTGATACGGCAAACTTCGTGATGCCTCTACGGGTCCG-3\u2032\n-\nrS:/5IAbRQ/CGGACCCGTATCAATCTCACGTATrAGGATATCCA/3AlexF546N/\nFe(III)-B12\n-\nE: GCGGCATGCGCGTTTGCGGCACCTAAACGCTCCTAATAGAG/3IAbRQSp/\n-\niE:GCGGCATGCGCGTTTGCGGCACCTAAACGCCCCCTAATAGAG/3IAbRQSp/\n-\nrS:/5Alex647N/CTCTATTArGGGAGACTCGCATGCCGC/3IAbRQSp/\nElectrophysiology\nAcute hippocampal slices were prepared from 16\u201318-week-old male mice, 1 month after stereotaxic injection of Ftl1-overexpressing (Ftl1 OE) or control virus. All procedures were approved by the IACUC of AfaSci (protocol no. 0223). Mice (28\u201342 g) were deeply anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; continuously bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2). ACSF composition (in mM) was as follows: 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3 and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Transverse hippocampal slices (400 \u03bcm) were prepared using a tissue slicer (Stoelting) and recovered for \u22651 hour at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF prior to recording. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in submerged slices perfused with oxygenated ACSF (flow rate: 1.75 ml min\u22121; DynaMAX pump) at room temperature. Glass microelectrodes (1\u20133 M\u03a9, ACSF-filled) were positioned in the stratum radiatum of CA1 to record responses evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals via a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC, Inc.), placed approximately 100 \u03bcm apart. Stimuli were 0.2-ms biphasic pulses (0.4-ms total duration) delivered every 10 seconds. Input/output (I\u2013O) curves were generated using 23 increasing current steps (20-\u00b5A increments) from threshold (20\u2013100 \u00b5A). Test pulse intensity was set to 30\u201350% of the maximal response. LTP was induced using two trains of 100-Hz stimulation (100 pulses, 1-second duration, 5 seconds apart). fEPSP slope was measured from the initial negative phase using Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Data points represent the average of three consecutive sweeps. Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated using a 50-ms interpulse interval as the ratio of the second to the first EPSP. Traces were low-pass filtered with a Gaussian filter (\u22123-dB cutoff: 1,260 Hz). Representative LTP traces are averages of six consecutive responses (1 minute, unfiltered). Recordings were completed within 8 hours of dissection. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.4, Excel and StatView 5.0. LTP was expressed as percent of baseline; the final 5 minutes were averaged for group comparisons. Results are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.\nOpen field\nMice were placed in the center of an open 40-cm \u00d7 40-cm square chamber (Kinder Scientific) with no cues or stimuli and allowed to move freely for 10 minutes. Infrared photobeam breaks were recorded and movement metrics were analyzed by Motor Monitor software (Kinder Scientific).\nNOR\nThe NOR task was performed following White et al.54. Mice were habituated to an empty arena for 10 minutes (day 1) and then allowed to explore two identical objects for 5 minutes (day 2). On day 3, one object was replaced with a novel one, and exploration time over 5 minutes was recorded using Smart Video Tracking Software (Panlab, Harvard Apparatus). To control for object and spatial bias, object identity and novel object location were counterbalanced across animals. Objects were selected to elicit exploration regardless of genotype or age. The preference index was calculated as follows: (Time_novel / (Time_novel + Time_familiar)) \u00d7 100, where 100% indicates full novel object preference. Mice failing to explore both objects during training were excluded.\nY maze\nSpatial recognition was evaluated in a Y maze as described previously. During training, mice explored the start and trained arms for 5 minutes, with the third (novel) arm blocked. Maze arms were alternated and cleaned between trials. After a 45-minute delay, mice were reintroduced and allowed to explore all three arms for 5 minutes. Entries and time in each arm were tracked (Smart Video Tracking Software). Percent arm entries were computed from the first minute of exploration. The discrimination index was calculated as follows: (Time_novel \u2212 Time_trained) / (Time_novel + Time_trained). Mice making fewer than three entries in the first minute were excluded.\nRadial arm water maze\nSpatial learning and memory was tested using an eight-arm radial arm water maze (RAWM) protocol55. Mice were trained to locate a constant goal arm, with the start arm varied between trials. Each incorrect entry was scored as an error. On day 1, mice underwent 12 training trials (blocks 1\u20134; alternating visible/hidden platforms), followed by three hidden-platform trials after a 1-hour break (block 5). On day 2, animals completed 15 hidden-platform trials (blocks 6\u201310). Errors were averaged per three-trial block. Experimenters were blinded to treatment and genotype during scoring.\nMice NADH treatment\nNADH (300 mg kg\u22121; Roche, cat. no. 10128023001) as well as vehicle (sodium chloride solution, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. S8776) were administrated intraperitoneally with an injection volume of 200 \u00b5l per mouse. All animals were treated with vehicle or NADH once daily for 9 days and for 2 hours pretrial.\nPrimary cell culture NADH treatment\nNADH (200 uM; Roche, cat. no. 10128023001) as well as vehicle (sodium chloride solution, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. S8776) were administrated for five consecutive days starting DIV14 until DIV18 included.\nData, statistical analyses and reproducibility\nAll experiments were randomized and blinded by an independent researcher. Researchers remained blinded throughout histological, biochemical and behavioral assessments. Groups were unblinded at the end of each experiment on statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. The distribution of data in each set of experiments was tested for normality using the D\u2019Agostino\u2013Pearson omnibus test or the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0, version 9.0 or version 10 (GraphPad Software).

      "text": "Researchers pinpoint common injury that's an early indicator of dementia\n- READ MORE: Common condition suffered by millions raises risk of Alzheimer's\nIt might seem like just a part of getting old - but suffering a fall could dramatically raise your risk of dementia.\nResearchers in Boston evaluated the medical records of more than 2.4million adults over 65, finding those who'd went to hospital after suffering a fall were 20 percent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia a year later than their peers.\nThe researchers said that the findings show elderly people who suffer a traumatic injury should be screened for cognitive problems, which can be a precursor for conditions like Alzheimer's.\nThere are now several approved medications to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, but they are most effective when given in the early stages of the disease.\nResearchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston found that sustaining a fall in old age increased the risk of dementia by 20 percent\nThe above graph shows the rate of dementia diagnoses following an injury. One year after injury, 10 percent of adults were diagnosed with dementia, compared to six percent from other injuries\nDr Molly Jarman, senior study author and deputy director of the Center for Surgery and Public Health at Brigman and Women's Hospital in Boston, said: 'Our study highlights the opportunity to intervene early and the need for more clinicians who can provide comprehensive care for older adults.\n'If we can establish that falls serve as early indicators of dementia, we could identify other precursors and early events that we could intervene on, which would significantly improve our approach to managing cognitive health in older adults.\nThe researchers analyzed injury data from Medicare Fee-For-Service, a healthcare payment system, while included 2.4million adults over age 66. More than half of the participants sustained a fall as their injury.\nThe majority of participants - 91 percent - were white, and over 60 percent were women.\nThe study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, found that within a year of a fall, one in 10 participants were diagnosed with dementia, compared to one in 15 of those who suffered a different injury.\nAfter analyzing for other factors, falling was associated with a 21 percent increased risk of dementia.\nDr Jarman said: 'The relationship between falls and dementia appears to be a two-way street.\n'Cognitive decline can increase the likelihood of falls, but trauma from those falls may also accelerate dementia's progression and make a diagnosis more likely down the line.\n'Thus, falls may be able to act as precursor events that can help us identify people who need further cognitive screening.'\nThe team noted that conducting cognitive screening after a fall could help detect dementia at any earlier stage, slowing progression and potentially increasing life expectancy.\nDr Alexander Ordoobadi, lead study author and resident physician in the Department of Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said: 'One of the biggest challenges we face is the lack of ownership in the process of follow-up screening for cognitive impairment, because there may not be adequate time for these screenings in an emergency department or trauma center setting.\n'Ideally, after an injury, older adults should receive follow up care with a primary care provider or geriatrician who can monitor their cognitive health and long-term functional recovery after the injury, but many older adults don\u2019t have a regular primary care provider and lack access to a geriatrician.'\nAlzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, affects about seven million Americans and nearly 1million Brits."

      "text": "Dementia explosion stunningly linked to one of America's favorite foods\n- READ MORE: One in two Americans will get dementia in their lives, experts warn\nEating too much steak and bacon may raise the risk of dementia later in life, a controversial, government-funded study suggests.\nHarvard researchers looked at 133,000 adults for four decades and evaluated how much processed and unprocessed red meat they ate on an average per day.\nThey found that eating one serving of processed red meat - roughly two slices of bacon or a single sausage - was linked to a 13 percent increased risk of dementia.\nThe study concluded that someone could cut their risk of getting the memory-robbing disorder by 28 percent by replacing a portion a day of processed red meat with the same amount of fish.\nThe team's more controversial find was that consuming at least one serving of unprocessed meat - a sirloin steak, ground beef or lamb, for example - was linked to a 16 percent increased chance of cognitive decline, which is a precursor to dementia.\nIt is well known that processed red meat, eaten to excess, is linked to colon cancer because of chemicals added to the meat as preservatives or produced when it is cooked.\nBut the team at Mass General Brigham say there is evidence eating too much processed red meat may also contribute to dementia.\nExperts have also cited flaws in recent research on unprocessed red meat, suggesting they only show observations and do not account for other lifestyle factors.\nA new study suggests red and processed meats may raise the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. However, red meat was associated with self-reported cognitive decline rather than actual increased dementia diagnoses\nThe study also did not look at steak, one of America's most common non-processed meats.\nThe results of the study should be treated with caution, as previous research has not always found a link between red meat consumption and dementia.\nBut a strength of the new research is that it analyzed people who answered detailed questions on their diet every two to four years, and who were tracked to see if they got dementia for decades - up to 43 years.\nProcessed red meat contains nitrites, added as preservatives to keep it from going bad, which may cause molecules called free radicals to get out of control and damage the brain.\nThe high salt content of foods like bacon can also lead to high blood pressure, damaging blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the brain and leading to vascular dementia - the second most common type of dementia.\nThe study, published in the journal Neurology, looked at data on health professionals in the US who signed up for research studies in middle age.\nAlmost 12,000 of these people developed dementia, and almost 17,500 female volunteers were given telephone assessments to judge their cognitive function - including memory, language skills and thinking speed.\nPeople\u2019s scores in these assessments were used to work out their \u2018brain age\u2019 for thinking skills, and people who ate too much red meat could have their brain age compared with others.\nThe results suggest someone\u2019s brain was about 20 months older, based on cognitive function, for every extra portion of processed red meat they ate per day.\nA portion is approximately three ounces of meat, which is the size of a deck of cards.\nPeople\u2019s verbal memory - their ability to remember words and the details of stories, for example - was worse, working out as the equivalent of a 20-month older brain, for every extra daily portion of processed red meat.\nResearchers also looked at people\u2019s self-reported cognitive problems, based on answers to questions such as whether they struggled to remember people or had recently lost their way.\nThese self-reports are less reliable than an expert assessment, but people who report thinking problems are often right about them, and later diagnosed with cognitive decline or dementia.\nPeople who ate at least a quarter of a portion of processed red meat a day were 14 percent more likely than those who ate a tenth of a portion on average to self-report cognitive issues.\nThe results also suggest too much unprocessed red meat, like beef and lamb, might have an effect on thinking skills.\nThe above graph shows rates of Alzheimer's per 100,000 people, both age-standardized and all ages. Age-standardization is a method used to adjust for differences in age distribution between populations or over time, while non-age-standardized is the raw rate calculated across all age groups in the population without any adjustment\nThe study found an increased prevalence of dementia in those who ate more processed meats like bacon and sausage. However, red meat did not have the same effect\nSelf-reported cognitive decline was 16 percent more likely in people eating at least one daily portion of unprocessed red meat on average, compared to those eating less than half a portion.\nHowever no increased risk of being diagnosed with dementia was found linked to unprocessed red meat.\nAll the findings from the study came after taking into account factors which might increase people\u2019s risk of dementia, such as their weight, physical activity and family history of dementia.\nRed meat, when it is digested in the body, produces a substance called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which some scientists believe may contribute to the build-up of proteins in the brain seen in dementia.\nHowever this is based only on studies involving animals, not humans.\nDr Wang said: \u2018Reducing how much red meat a person eats and replacing it with other protein sources and plant-based options could be included in dietary guidelines to promote cognitive health.\u2019\nCurrently nearly 8million Americans currently have some form of dementia and there are around 500,000 new cases diagnosed per year.\nDiagnoses are also expected to rise from 60,000 in 2020 to 179,000 per year by 2060.\nDementia also affects nearly 1million Brits, and it's estimated one in 11 people over 65 have the condition. Figures are expected to rise to 1.4million by 2040, according to the Alzheimer's Society.\nDr Peter Attia, a surgeon and founder of Early Medical, said research on red meat often doesn't account for other lifestyle factors like smoking and sedentary lifestyles\nThe findings come admid recent criticism of studies on the health effects of red meat.\nIn a recent episode of the Triggernometry podcast, Dr Peter Attia, a surgeon and founder of Early Medical, suggested much of the research linking red meat to negative health outcomes like dementia and colon cancer could be flawed.\nHe said: 'The problem is epidemiology, especially when the hazard ratios are relatively small, is so fraught with errors. Epidemiology only identifies associations, but it can never identify causation.\n'One of the big challenges with the red meat epidemiology stuff is that people consuming red meat and people not consuming red meat tend to be proxies on average for very different behaviors.\nHe noted that people consume higher amounts of red meat are also more likely to consume more processed meats like beef jerky and bacon.\nHowever, those who steer clear of red meat also are more likely to exercise, quit smoking, and add more fruits and vegetables to their diet.\nDr Attia said: 'I think there's more nuance to it than that frankly and I think it also comes down to the type of red meat you're going to consume. And I don't think all red meat is created equal.'\nThe researchers in the new study said there are several limitations, including relying on observational data and using self-reported data to measure cognitive decline.\nThe study also mainly included white professionals, which made the sample size less diverse."

  "argos_summary": "Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have discovered that targeting the protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) can reverse memory loss in aging mice. By reducing FTL1 levels in older mice, cognitive performance improved to levels comparable to younger mice, suggesting a potential pathway to address age-related cognitive decline. The study highlights the importance of understanding how aging affects brain function and opens up new avenues for treating cognitive impairments in the aging population.",
