  "content": "Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper will fly the British flag at the US Open\n\nEmma Raducanu and Jack Draper have been handed exciting paths at the US Open, with the draw taking place on Thursday. The two players will fly the flag for Great Britain in the final Grand Slam tournament of the year. They have been handed simple starts on paper, with the pair set to face qualifiers or lucky losers in their opening matches.\n\nIn the event Raducanu finds some form and gets through the first two rounds, she could face Elena Rybakina in round three. She will be hoping to mount a deep run at the tournament she won against all odds back in 2021. It will be her first Grand Slam under the watchful eye of Francisco Roig, her new coach who previously worked with Rafael Nadal.\n\nDraper, meanwhile, could go up against Jannik Sinner in the quarter-finals if he makes it through to the last eight. Sinner is currently battling illness but his coach Darren Cahill has insisted that he will be 'fine' for the US Open.\n\nWe'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures, and video on this breaking news story.\n\nStay up to date with all the big headlines, pictures, analysis, opinion and video on the stories that matter to you.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @DExpress_Sport - the official Daily Express & Express.co.uk Twitter account - providing real news in real-time.\n\nWe're also on Facebook @DailyExpressSport - offering your must-see news, features, videos, and pictures throughout the day to like, comment, and share from the Daily Express, Sunday Express, and Express.co.uk.",
