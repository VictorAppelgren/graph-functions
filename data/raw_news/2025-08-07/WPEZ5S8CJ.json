  "title": "Trump's Truth Social Tests AI Search Engine Powered by Perplexity",
  "description": "The platform expects the AI search engine to 'exponentially increase the amount of information available to its users.' Early tests suggest it isn't biased toward its majority owner.",
  "content": "President Trump's social media platform, Truth Social, is testing its own AI search engine.\n\nThe feature, dubbed Truth Search AI, is powered by Perplexity. It's currently in beta for users on the web, and will be available on iOS and Android soon.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the company behind the app, didn't reveal much about Truth Search AI except that it \"is intended to enhance the Truth Social platform and exponentially increase the amount of information available to its users.\"\n\nThe announcement heaps praise on Perplexity, calling it \"a software and AI company dedicated to providing direct, contextually accurate answers with transparent citations.\"\n\nMedia outlets, however, have criticized Perplexity for scraping content without permission. It is currently facing legal action from News Corp , the company behind The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, Conde Nast , which owns The New Yorker, Vogue, and Wired, and , among others. Recently, internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare likened the platform to North Korean hackers for bypassing anti-scraping protections on websites.\n\nStill, Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said he's \"proud to partner with Perplexity to launch our public Beta testing of Truth Social AI, which will make Truth Social an even more vital element in the Patriot Economy.\"\n\nAs far as the new AI product is concerned, 404Media threw some political questions to check if it is biased toward its majority owner. About the American economy, the chatbot said it is \"facing significant headwinds, with signs of slowdown\u2014most notably by a contraction in GDP, rising inflation, and softening labor market conditions.\"\n\nWhen asked if the president's reciprocal tariffs are to blame, Truth Search AI said they \"had a negative effect on economic growth and employment, raising costs for businesses and consumers while providing only limited benefits to some manufacturing sectors.\"\n\nThis is just the beginning for AI search on the platform. \"We plan to robustly refine and expand our search function based on user feedback as we implement a wide range of additional enhancements to the platform,\" Nunes said.\n\nTruth Social, seen as an alternative to Elon Musk's X, hasn't quite taken off since launch. Its parent company reported a net loss of $20 million last quarter. On X, meanwhile, the social network's Grok chatbot is not shy about criticizing Musk or Trump. When someone complained to Musk about Grok being \"manipulated by leftist indoctrination,\" Musk responded : \"I know. Working on fixing that this week.\" The tweak, however, resulted in the chatbot of antisemitic and pro-Adolf Hitler responses .",

      "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s media company is teaming up with Perplexity to bring AI search to Truth Social, the President\u2019s X.com alternative.\nTruth announced the endeavor in a press release on Wednesday. Anyone using the browser version of Truth can now use Perplexity to search the web. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to partner with Perplexity to launch our public Beta testing of Truth Social AI, which will make Truth Social an even more vital element in the Patriot Economy,\u201d Devin Nunes, Trump Media's CEO and Chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, said in the press release.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Truth Social to bring powerful AI to an audience with important questions. Curiosity is the engine of change, and Perplexity\u2019s AI is developed to empower curiosity by delivering direct, reliable answers with transparent citations that allow anyone to dig deeper,\u201d Perplexity\u2019s chief business officer Dmitry Shevelenko said in the press release.\nAccording to the announcement, \u201cthe mission of Trump Media is to end Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech by opening up the Internet and giving people their voices back.\u201d Which is a funny thing to put in an announcement about Trump partnering with a company whose investors include Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, and the former CEO of GitHub.\nPerplexity\u2019s Truth Social search engine will be powered by stolen content. Earlier this week, Cloudflare reported Perplexity used stealth and undeclared crawlers to evade websites that explicitly set themselves up to avoid being catalogued by LLMs. Perplexity has a long history of using scrapers that ignore the Robots Exclusion Protocol. Perplexity started as a demo that scraped Twitter with fake academic accounts backed by AI-generated research proposals.\nForbes, the New York Times, New York Post, and the Dow Jones have all accused Perplexity of plagiarism. News Corp\u2018s Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post sued Perplexity in 2024 for copyright infringement, claiming in the federal lawsuit that Perplexity is \u201cengaging in a massive amount of illegal copying of publishers\u2019 copyrighted works and diverting customers and critical revenues away from those copyright holders.\u201d In 2024, WIRED reported on the accusations of Perplexity\u2019s plagiarism and Perplexity almost immediately plagiarized the story. When New York Times tech workers went on strike last year, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas offered to help the Times keep the paper going.\nBig Tech has aligned itself with the Trump administration since before the election, seeing an alliance of opportunity for deregulation of AI in particular.\nBut is the Perplexity-powered AI aggregation machine \u201cwoke?\u201d I asked a few questions to find out. I wanted to know: Is Trump in the Epstein files?\u201cThere is no evidence in the recently reviewed and released government \u2018Epstein Files\u2019 of a \u2018client list\u201d or documentation placing Donald Trump as implicated in Jeffrey Epstein's criminal actions,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile Trump\u2019s name, like many other prominent individuals, appears in public records of Epstein\u2019s social and business contacts (such as guest lists or flight logs, widely reported over the years), there is no mention in current official documents or filings that directly implicates Trump as a criminal participant in Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking activities.\u201d\nHow does Truth Social\u2019s search engine think the American economy is doing?\n\u201cThe American economy is currently facing significant headwinds, with signs of slowdown\u2014most notably by a contraction in GDP, rising inflation, and softening labor market conditions\u2014though some leaders still emphasize areas of resilience,\u201d Truth Search AI said.\nAre the tariffs to blame?\u201cRecent tariff increases in the United States have generally had a negative effect on economic growth and employment, raising costs for businesses and consumers while providing only limited benefits to some manufacturing sectors,\u201d Truth Search AI said.\nDamn. It\u2019s woke as hell."
