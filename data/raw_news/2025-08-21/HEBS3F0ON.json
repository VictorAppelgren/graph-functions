  "content": "By Deanna Neff HealthDay ReporterTHURSDAY, Aug. 21, 2025 (HealthDay News) \u2014 A resident of South Lake Tahoe, California, has been diagnosed with the plague, the state\u2019s first human plague infection since 2020.\n\nThe patient \u2014 who was camping in the South Lake Tahoe area, near the Nevada border \u2014 may have been bitten by an infected flea, officials said in a news release. An investigation is underway.\n\n\"Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County,\" said Kyle Fliflet, the county\u2019s acting public health director. \"It\u2019s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present.\u201d\n\nThe disease, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is most commonly transmitted to humans by fleas that have acquired it from infected wild rodents such as squirrels and chipmunks, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). People can also be infected while handling infected animals. Dogs and cats may also carry infected fleas.\n\nWhile the plague gained a fearsome reputation as the cause of the millions of deaths in Europe in the Middle Ages, modern treatment with common antibiotics can be highly effective if the disease is diagnosed and treated early.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health noted that while no human cases have been reported since 2020, authorities found evidence of plague exposure in 41 rodents around the South Lake Tahoe area between 2021 to 2024, according to NBC News.\n\nIn addition, four rodents have tested positive so far in 2025, all in the Tahoe basin.\n\nHealth officials are urging residents and visitors to be aware of the risk and to take simple precautions.\n\nIndividuals should not \u201ctouch squirrels, chipmunks or other wild rodents, especially those that are dead or injured. People should not camp near where dead rodents were observed, and they should wear long pants tucked into boots and spray bug repellent to reduce flea exposure,\u201d officials warned in a news release.\n\nThe CDC also encourages people to make sure pets are protected with flea control products. People should also avoid sharing a bed with pets that roam in exposed areas and make their property less attractive to rodents by clearing brush, rock piles and other hiding spaces and by removing potential food supply.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about how the plague spreads.",

      "text": "Key points\n- People who live in areas where plague occurs can take several steps to reduce their risk of becoming infected.\n- People usually get plague after being bitten by an infected rodent flea or by handling an infected animal.\nPrevention tips\n- Reduce rodent habitat around your home, workplace, and recreational areas. Remove brush, rock piles, junk, cluttered firewood, and possible rodent food supplies, such as pet and wild animal food. Make your home and outbuildings rodent-proof.\n- Wear gloves if you are handling or skinning potentially infected animals to prevent contact between your skin and the plague bacteria. Contact your local health department if you have questions about disposal of dead animals.\n- Use repellent if you think you could be exposed to fleas during activities such as camping, hiking, or working outdoors. Products containing DEET can be applied to the skin as well as clothing and products containing permethrin can be applied to clothing (always follow instructions on the label).\n- Keep fleas off of your pets by applying flea control products. Animals that roam freely are more likely to come in contact with plague infected animals or fleas and could bring them into homes. If your pet becomes sick, seek care from a veterinarian as soon as possible.\n- Do not allow dogs or cats that roam free in endemic areas to sleep on your bed.\nNote: A plague vaccine is no longer available in the United States. New plague vaccines are in development but are not expected to be commercially available in the immediate future."

      "text": "Key points\n- The bacterium that causes plague, Yersinia pestis, is transmitted by fleas and cycles naturally among wild rodents.\n- People usually get plague after being bitten by an infected rodent flea or by handling an infected animal.\n- People can also become infected through exposure to sick pets, especially cats.\nHow it spreads\nThe plague bacteria can be transmitted to humans in the following ways:\nFlea bites. Plague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics, many rodents die, causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primary bubonic plague or septicemic plague.\nContact with contaminated fluid or tissue. Humans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague-infected animal. For example, a hunter skinning a rabbit or other infected animal without using proper precautions (e.g., gloves) could become infected with plague bacteria. This form of exposure most commonly results in bubonic plague or septicemic plague.\nInfectious droplets. Humans and animals with plague pneumonia can sometimes cough droplets containing plague bacteria into the air. These bacteria-containing droplets can cause pneumonic plague in another person if inhaled. Typically, this requires direct and close contact with the person or animal with pneumonic plague. Transmission of these droplets is the only way that plague can spread between people. Person-to-person spread has not been documented in the United States since 1924, but there continue to be rare cases of pneumonic plague among people exposed to sick cats. Cats are particularly susceptible to plague and can be infected by eating infected rodents. Cats with plague pose a risk of transmitting infectious plague droplets to their owners or to veterinarians.\nEcology\nThe bacteria that cause plague, Y. pestis, maintain their existence in a cycle involving rodents and their fleas. Plague occurs in rural and semi-rural areas of the western United States, primarily in semi-arid upland forests and grasslands where many types of rodent species can be involved. Many types of animals, such as rock squirrels, wood rats, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, mice, voles, and rabbits can be affected by plague. Wild carnivores can become infected by eating other infected animals.\nScientists think that plague bacteria circulate at low rates within populations of certain rodents without causing excessive rodent die-off. These infected animals and their fleas serve as long-term reservoirs for the bacteria. This is called the enzootic cycle.\nOccasionally, other species become infected, causing an outbreak among animals, called an epizootic. Humans are usually more at risk during, or shortly after, a plague epizootic.\nIn parts of the developing world, plague can sometimes occur in urban areas with dense rat infestations. The last urban outbreak of rat-associated plague in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924-1925."
