  "title": "A year-by-year guide to teaching your kids to manage their money",
  "description": "The new school term brings opportunities to teach children different aspects of spending, saving and investing.",
  "content": "Around this point in the summer holidays, it tends to dawn on parents that the new term is just around the corner. They may focus on the immediate panic of discovering the kids have grown out of everything over the summer, but in the maelstrom it\u2019s also worth taking a step back and considering the opportunities the new term brings - not just for their schooling, but also for their financial education.\n\nEach new school year presents you with an opportunity to focus on just one thing to build your child\u2019s knowledge gradually and carefully so that by the time they finish school, they\u2019re ready for the adult money world. Clearly there are no hard and fast rules, and every child learns at different ages and stages, so think of this as a rough outline of things you can consider.\n\nReception: If you haven\u2019t already given your kids pocket money, this could be a good time to start. It gives them the chance to start making some decisions around what they spend their money on, and will reduce the pester power you\u2019re subjected to.\n\nRead more: How to find the weak link in your finances\n\nYear 2: Introduce them to saving, and open a child\u2019s account for them. When they\u2019re seven, they may be able to pay money in and take it out themselves. There are a few ways you can try to encourage them to build a savings habit. Have conversations about things they might want to save for and consider offering to match any money they put into their savings account.\n\nYear 3: Some people will get their children to earn their pocket money by doing jobs around the house. Others will discuss the idea of working and earning money, so they start to understand the role it will play in their lives.\n\nYear 4: Based on your experience of their approach to finance so far, you can chat to them about emotions and money. By this stage, you will have seen the habits they\u2019ve fallen into, whether they tend to spend without thinking, or worry too much about spending choices. You can encourage them to think more carefully about this sort of thing.\n\nYear 5: They\u2019re likely to be exposed to fads by this age, either in the playground or through social media and influencers \u2013 or both. You may want them to join in with their friends, but also talk to them about the phenomenon and get them to consider where value for money fits into their decisions.\n\nYear 6: At this stage they will be familiar with brands and companies that are important to them, so you can discuss these companies and the fact that they could own a share of them. If they have a Junior ISA, it\u2019s a great way to explore the subject together.",

      "text": "Fans of The Weakest Link will be celebrating 25 years of their favourite game show this week. Somehow, the players always seem to send the wrong person home at the end of each round, but it\u2019s easily done, because it can be incredibly difficult to identify weaknesses when you\u2019re in the thick of things \u2014 and the same holds true for our finances.\nThe risk is that we only appreciate the weak link in our finances when something goes wrong, and it\u2019s too late, so it\u2019s worth considering our position, and where we\u2019re likely to fall short.\nBudget\nUntil we reach the age of 35, a major issue is that most people have nowhere near enough money left at the end of the month to be resilient. The Hargreaves Lansdown Savings and Resilience Barometer shows that between the ages of 20 and 24, only 15% have enough.\nIt means this is the stage when drawing up a budget, shopping around for the cheapest possible deals, and sticking with the plan during the tough times is particularly important.\nSavings\nIn your 20s, you\u2019re particularly likely not to have enough emergency savings either. To be resilient, households need enough to cover three to six months\u2019 worth of essential spending \u2014 rising to one to three years\u2019 worth in retirement.\nRead more: What having children later in life means for your money\nIt means working out what you can\u2019t live without, calculating how much you spend on these things, and then multiplying them by the number of months that suit your circumstances \u2014 depending on how secure your position is and how many people are relying on you.\nWhatever your age, this is worth checking, because while older people tend to have built more savings, overall a third of people still have a shortfall.\nIf you need to build more, it pays to set up a direct debit out of your account on payday straight into an easy access savings account.\nProperty\nHome ownership is a struggle across the board and only around a third of people are on track for home ownership.\nHowever, there are particular gaps at younger ages, and fewer than one in five are on schedule in their late 20s. It\u2019s always going to be difficult to free up cash at this stage, but if you can put money aside for a deposit, it\u2019s worth considering a lifetime ISA and getting a boost from the government.\nInsurance\nWhen people hit their 30s, protection becomes more pressing, and gaps open up. You should have enough life insurance to cover your liabilities, and to cover the cost of bringing any children up to an age when they can take responsibility for their own lives.\nIn our 30s, only around a third of people have enough cover and in our 40s it\u2019s still only around half. It\u2019s worth doing the maths as well as considering what you would live on if you were too sick to work."

  "argos_summary": "The article outlines a step\u2011by\u2011step approach to teaching children financial skills from reception through year six, starting with pocket money, saving, earning, emotional understanding, consumer awareness, and even basic investment concepts. It then shifts to adult financial resilience, noting that most people in their 20s lack sufficient budget discipline, emergency savings, and home\u2011ownership progress, and that gaps widen in insurance coverage as people age. The piece stresses the importance of early budgeting, automatic savings, and planning for life events to avoid discovering weak links only when problems arise.",
