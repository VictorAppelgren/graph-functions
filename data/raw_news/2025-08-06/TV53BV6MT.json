  "description": "What accusations of sexual misconduct? What allegations of racist language? Despite firing its hosts, the BBC food show seems to be pretending there is no problem here \u2026",
  "content": "To say that this year\u2019s MasterChef UK has been an unmitigated calamity for the BBC feels like an understatement. In early July, Gregg Wallace was fired from the show after a series of sexual misconduct allegations, including one accusation of unwanted touching (45 out of 83 claims against him were upheld following an official report), leaving the BBC with a headache over whether to broadcast the latest series, which was filmed last autumn. It then emerged that the report into Wallace\u2019s behaviour had also highlighted an accusation of racist language on the part of his co-host of 20 years, John Torode. The BBC swiftly dispensed with him, too, despite him saying that he doesn\u2019t believe the incident happened.\n\nThe corporation confirmed in late July that it would broadcast the series anyway; one contestant, Sarah Shafi, was so appalled by the decision that she asked to be edited out. Meanwhile, the broadcasting union Bectu said: \u201cIf [the BBC] are serious about addressing this industry-wide problem, broadcasters should not reward bad behaviour with primetime coverage.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, no advanced screeners were offered to the media; the first three episodes landed unannounced on BBC iPlayer on Wednesday morning, ahead of its 8pm broadcast on BBC One.\n\nAnd so to the programme itself. Would the first episode be full of jarring jump-cuts, introduced to minimise the presence of Torode and Wallace? Would it seem as though the pair had just happened to wander on to the set now and again?\n\nIt began like any other series of MasterChef, with the narrator, India Fisher, introducing the latest \u201cbattle for the ultimate culinary prize\u201d between 60 new contestants, over some characteristically tense music. As in previous series, Wallace and Torode featured prominently in the opening montage, alongside nervous contestants and lingering shots of plates buckling under the weight of jus and garnishes, with Torode saying: \u201cThis is the sort of stuff that dreams are made of,\u201d and Wallace describing one dish as \u201ca cracker of a job\u201d.\n\nAs usual, the first challenge was \u201cbasic to brilliant\u201d. As usual, Torode and Wallace introduced the conceit (contestants have to zhoosh up a workaday grocery item of their choosing). The duo stood and salivated at the prospect of digital marketing manager Thea\u2019s gorgonzola risotto and recruiter Gon\u2019s take on the Thai dish kaphrao. But there wasn\u2019t as much in the way of witty repartee between the hosts and the contestants, unlike the previous series, which opened with one participant declaring that they \u201c[couldn\u2019t] wait to meet John and Gregg and hoping that Wallace would give their dish a \u201cphwoar\u201d of approval.\n\nNonetheless, both were definitely, firmly hosting the show. Wallace was limited to asking questions rather than offering up punchlines, but he delivered his usual gushing critiques. Speaking of business development manager Gemma\u2019s mackerel-heavy take on the Malaysian national dish, nasi lemak, he said: \u201cI could dip bread in this all day.\u201d Torode quibbled over whether vocal coach Beth\u2019s chocolate and orange ganache tart was, in fact, merely a chocolate tart. Overall, very much business as usual.\n\nGon and Shaun, a digital marketing manager, received the first aprons and progressed to the next round. Then it was on to the mystery box challenge, with the amateur cooks charged with fashioning a dish from any or all of trout, beetroot and chocolate. As always, there was some light chat from Torode and Wallace about the sort of mistakes the contestants might make, with comments that seemed far from truncated. \u201cWe have a trout-off!\u201d declared Torode as four contestants reached for the fish. Wallace quizzed writer Penelope about her skills with invention and asked whether her couscous was likely to turn into porridge.\n\nThe critiques were largely effusive, even if Torode did have to console an overwhelmed Thea with the words: \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing, isn\u2019t it MasterChef?\u201d Those words would take on a greater meaning in the months after filming. Thea was booted off alongside Gemma, with Penelope and Beth bagging the next two aprons.\n\nIn the final round, the four remaining contenders cooked for the 2024 champion, Brin Pirathapan, and the finalists Chris Willoughby and Louise Lyons Macleod. As the hosts fawned over Gon\u2019s Thai-influenced steak tartare and risotto and Shaun\u2019s scissor-cut noodles, it was just like old times.\n\nPirathapan, Willoughby and Lyons Macleod took centre stage as the food started to appear, but not in a way that seemed out of the ordinary for the show\u2019s guest judges. Still, their presence was surely a boon to Banijay, the producer of the show, which could give over a huge chunk of the episode\u2019s final 20 minutes to their discussions about what makes a good tartare and whether fish and apples should ever be on the same plate.\n\nBut there was still much time given over to Wallace and Torode, speaking with their mouths half-full, raving over a chicken dish that Wallace said he could have eaten by the kilo. By the time the names of the three contestants advancing to the next stage of the competition were announced over a bed of uplifting plinky-plonk music, it was easy to forget that there had ever been a national controversy.\n\nIt was always going to be a challenge to be faithful to the series while also editing out the two people at the centre of it, but if episode one is anything to go by, it seems the BBC and Banijay have decided essentially to ignore the problem and hope that putting out more or less the same show as ever will suffice. Maybe further chopping the contributions of Wallace and Torode would have felt ludicrous, but it might also have been the right thing to do. Instead, the BBC is getting to have its chocolate ganache tart and eat it. Still, you imagine the ratings will be astronomical. Phwoar indeed.",

      "text": "Even if you don\u2019t know what India Fisher looks like, you will recognise her voice. It is there on 15 seasons of MasterChef and 13 seasons of Celebrity MasterChef, where Fisher\u2019s narration \u2013 at times arch, at times spry, but always lustrous \u2013 turns an assemblage of people burning things and Gregg Wallace saying \u201ccooking doesn\u2019t get tougher than this\u201d into something much greater. \u201cMy agent describes it as \u2018assured and husky\u2019,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cBut who knows?\u201d\nIt is a remarkable, living thing and has helped Fisher become Britain\u2019s most sought-after voiceover artist. She is the voice of NatWest telephone banking, Channel 5 reality TV show Make or Break? and, among others, advertising campaigns for boiling-water tap Quooker and Always sanitary towels (after the ad aired, viewers complained that it was making them hungry). As a member of the Dead Ringers cast on BBC Radio 4, she has impersonated Kelly Osbourne, Charlotte Church and Sonia from EastEnders. Since 1999, she has played the Doctor\u2019s companion Charlotte Pollard in the Doctor Who audio plays made by Big Finish.\nOn MasterChef, Fisher can take words such as \u201csamphire\u201d and \u201cbouillabaisse\u201d and turn them into objects of effervescent desire. Her voice should come with a parental advisory sticker or an 18+ age rating. \u201cIt\u2019s Nigella in a dressing gown with a big spoon at midnight,\u201d Fisher laughs. \u201cI think people imagine a much sexier, thin person. And then they meet me and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh.\u2019 There\u2019s a slight flicker of disappointment.\u201d\nFisher is 44, with an open face and dark blond hair. On the street, you would probably peg her as a Boden mum \u2013 a bit posh, but jolly and direct.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been recognised on two occasions,\u201d she says. \u201cOne was early on. I was at Gatecrasher Festival, trying to work my way through a tent with my friends. This bloke did a really obvious double take and came up to me and tapped me on the shoulder. I thought, this is odd. He said: \u2018You\u2019re India Fisher, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 I replied: \u2018You\u2019re a Doctor Who fan, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d She leans forward. \u201cThen, 10 years later, someone else came up to me on the street and said: \u2018You\u2019re India Fisher!\u2019 And I said: \u2018This is really odd \u2013 it\u2019s happened to me once before.\u2019 And he said: \u2018Yes, that was me.\u2019\u201d She hoots hysterically. \u201cMy fan club is made up of \u2026 one person!\u201d\nI put it to Fisher that her line of work is an unusual one \u2013 invisible yet also hyper-public. She nods. \u201cI am very grateful for the anonymity that voiceover work has given me. Because I can get the tube and live a normal life \u2013 unless I see my one fan.\u201d I tell her that I spent yesterday on hold with her \u2013 I bank with NatWest. \u201cOh no!\u201d she groans. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201d Fisher is so ubiquitous that sometimes she forgets her own voice. She will call NatWest and it will take \u201cthree or four goes of pressing a button to remember it\u2019s me.\u201d\nShe never set out to be a voiceover artist \u2013 she wanted to be an actor. After studying English and drama at the University of Manchester, she got her break performing in the satirical show NewsRevue at the Edinburgh festival fringe \u2013 a Big Finish producer saw her, which led to her landing the Doctor Who gig. That led to Dead Ringers, and, through co-star Jan Ravens, her agent. \u201cShe got me MasterChef, so I have to thank Jan for everything. I didn\u2019t realise what voiceovers were then \u2013 I had no idea! MasterChef was the first voiceover audition I ever went for.\u201d She feels fortunate to have landed the job, but says the work of a voiceover artist is isolating. \u201cYou go along on your own, sit in a darkened, soundproof room, do your job and go home again. There\u2019s no Christmas party. It can be lonely.\u201d\nHer training as an actor proved invaluable. \u201cPeople say: \u2018How do you convey sadness?\u2019 Well, that\u2019s just how you act it. But if you\u2019re conveying running down a corridor, which you have to do a lot in Doctor Who, you pump your arms and run on the spot \u2026 It\u2019s more physical than people think it is.\u201d When it comes to commercial voiceovers, Fisher will be upbeat, because upbeat sells. \u201cIn order to do that, you smile. Smiling is a sure way of getting an upbeat tone to your voice.\u201d\nNarrating MasterChef since its 2004 reboot has given Fisher a unique view of the nation\u2019s eating habits. \u201cIn the early days, the people were good cooks, and their MasterChef journey was that they were taught to plate it up properly. Now, the amateurs come along and they plate as brilliantly as the professionals. It\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d She no longer has to define words such as velout\u00e9 or tian, because viewers know what they mean.\n\u201cI personally credit MasterChef with making us much more of a foodie nation.\u201d\nWhat makes Fisher\u2019s voice so remarkable? \u201cOne of the most important properties is the breathiness,\u201d says Prof Yi Xu, an expert in speech sciences at University College London. His research shows that breathy female voices are typically seen as more attractive. Being posh also helps. \u201cTo sound posh is to sound authoritative, and that\u2019s important for shows like MasterChef.\u201d\nFisher and I are having lunch in a London cafe. I ask her to describe her salad for me, then immediately regret it, because she looks so uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is,\u201d she stumbles. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I have scripts written for me.\u201d I beam at her expectantly. Her smile grows tight. \u201cPickled cabbage with an \u2026 edamame bean side and cos lettuce?\u201d Later, she confesses that she hates being asked to do the MasterChef voice on demand. \u201cPeople always say: \u2018Can you read the menu for me?\u2019 And I just say no.\u201d (She will make an exception if a friend is getting married and read their wedding menu.)\nI understand her reluctance. She is not a performing seal. And, in real life, Fisher sounds ordinary. If you expect her to lovingly roll her vowels like Scheherazade seducing a king in exchange for her life, you will be disappointed. Without a microphone a few inches from her face, Fisher sounds like a regular woman, having a chat.\nBefore lunch, I had accompanied her to a recording for the upcoming 14th season of Celebrity MasterChef. \u201cThe first time I met you, it wasn\u2019t until you started speaking in the booth that I heard The Voice,\u201d remembers dubbing mixer James Whittlesea.\nThey reminisce about their struggles to know how certain ingredients should be pronounced. Turmeric, for example. \u201cLike, is it tuh-ma-rick or tumour-ick?\u201d explains the series editor Katie Attwood. (The MasterChef received pronunciation is tuh-ma-rick, but every time Fisher says it, she can hear her mother tutting in her head, because she would say \u201ctumour-ick\u201d.) And don\u2019t get Fisher started on chorizo. \u201cIt started off as chorithoo, and then it went to chorit-zo, but I was very unhappy with that, because as far as I was concerned there was no \u2018t\u2019 in it,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cChorit-zo didn\u2019t last very long. I stamped my little foot at chorit-zo. And then John [Torode] started saying choritho and I said: \u2018Can we go with that?\u2019\u201d The other word that gives Fisher the most bother is \u2013 ironically \u2013 cuisine, which she struggles to pronounce. (She uses the word \u201ccookery\u201d instead.)\nTalk of chorizo and turmeric over, Fisher picks up her mug of tea and steps into the recording booth behind the sofa where I am sitting. Stirring music plays as an image of five celebrities walking over a bridge appears on the screen at the far end of the room. \u201cThese five celebrities are taking on the challenge to become the next MasterChef champion,\u201d booms a disembodied voice. I swivel around, astonished. Fisher smiles back at me. I feel abashed. Can this voice really be coming from the same person? But it is.\nListening to Fisher say words like \u201conion gravy\u201d or \u201csuet\u201d with such rich timbre is like listening to a Stradivarius being played in a concert hall with perfect acoustics. I keep sneaking looks at Fisher as she reads the script, expecting to see \u2026 I don\u2019t know what, really. Because she is just a woman in a booth, speaking out loud.\nHow to make your voice more compelling\nIf you want to convey authority in a professional context, lower the pitch of your voice. \u201cIt worked for Thatcher \u2013 she lowered her voice and everyone listened to her!\u201d says India Fisher. \u201cPeople tend to like a lower, more commanding voice.\u201d\nTo sound more appealing and upbeat, smile. \u201cSmiling while you\u2019re chatting will make your voice sound bright and welcoming.\u201d\nFor a surefire power move, speak quietly. \u201cYou see it in The Devil Wears Prada. Meryl Streep barely speaks above a whisper. When people have to strain to hear you, it makes you seem more important, because people have to be on your level.\u201d\nWhen it comes to public speaking, take it slow. \u201cDon\u2019t gabble! Speak slowly.\u201d And try not to over-project your voice \u2013 it will sound strained, as if you are shouting.\nIf you really want to sound your best, avoid caffeine or dairy. \u201cIt\u2019s very claggy for the voice.\u201d\nCelebrity MasterChef is on BBC One on Wednesdays at 8pm and on Mondays and Fridays at 9pm"

      "text": "The BBC is to broadcast a series of MasterChef featuring Gregg Wallace and John Torode, filmed before the presenters were dropped after facing upheld allegations over their behaviour.\nThe corporation said airing the show was the \u201cright thing to do\u201d for the amateur chefs who took part. Producers spoke to contestants to ascertain whether they wanted the programme to be shown.\nThe show will be broadcast as normal on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 6 August. However, the editing of the programme will be looked at again to examine the prominence of the pair.\n\u201cMasterChef is an amazing competition which is life-changing for the amateur chefs taking part,\u201d a BBC spokesperson said. \u201cThe focus of it has always been their skill and their journey.\n\u201cThis has not been an easy decision in the circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it. In showing the series, which was filmed last year, it in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters. We have been very clear on the standards of behaviour that we expect of those who work at the BBC or on shows made for the BBC.\n\u201cHowever, we believe that broadcasting this series is the right thing to do for these cooks who have given so much to the process. We want them to be properly recognised and give the audience the choice to watch the series.\u201d\nBBC executives have been agonising over what to do with the series for weeks. Filming was all but complete when allegations over Wallace\u2019s behaviour emerged at the end of last year. Torode appears throughout and Wallace appears in all episodes apart from the final.\nEarlier this month, Wallace was dropped by the BBC after an independent report, commissioned by MasterChef\u2019s producer, Banijay, substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact.\nWallace has said he was \u201cdeeply sorry for any distress caused\u201d and he had \u201cnever set out to harm or humiliate\u201d, but has said the report had cleared him of \u201cthe most serious and sensational accusations made against me\u201d.\nTorode was also dropped after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over the use of racist language, which he believes never happened.\nNo decision has been made on the celebrity and Christmas editions of the show, which have already been filmed and feature Torode. The BBC said it would announce a decision on those later this year.\n\u201cMost importantly MasterChef is a brilliant, much-loved programme which is bigger than any one individual,\u201d the BBC said. \u201cThere are many talented, dedicated and hard-working people who make the show what it is. It will continue to flourish on the BBC and we look forward to it returning stronger than ever in the future.\u201d\nMasterChef is hugely important for the BBC, featuring in its listings for the majority of the year. It has also invested in the show recently, with its move to state-of-the-art studios in Birmingham. The show is also a major cash cow for Banijay, with scores of versions of the show running around the world."

      "text": "John Torode will not return to MasterChef after its producers confirmed his contract would not be renewed after an allegation of using racist language.\nThe Australian-born chef, 59, had confirmed on Monday evening he was the subject of an allegation that was upheld as part of an inquiry into the behaviour of his former co-presenter Gregg Wallace.\nA spokesperson for the production company Banijay UK said on Tuesday: \u201cIn response to John Torode\u2019s statement, it is important to stress that Banijay UK takes this matter incredibly seriously. The legal team at Lewis Silkin that investigated the allegations relating to Gregg Wallace also substantiated an accusation of highly offensive racist language against John Torode which occurred in 2018.\n\u201cThis matter has been formally discussed with John Torode by Banijay UK, and whilst we note that John says he does not recall the incident, Lewis Silkin have upheld the very serious complaint. Banijay UK and the BBC are agreed that we will not renew his contract on MasterChef.\u201d\nA BBC spokesperson said the allegation against Torode \u201cinvolves an extremely offensive racist term being used in the workplace\u201d, which was \u201cinvestigated and substantiated\u201d by the independent investigation led by Lewis Silkin.\nThey added: \u201cJohn Torode denies the allegation. He has stated he has no recollection of the alleged incident and does not believe that it happened. He also says that any racial language is wholly unacceptable in any environment.\n\u201cThe BBC takes this upheld finding extremely seriously. We will not tolerate racist language of any kind and, as we have already said, we told Banijay UK, the makers of MasterChef, that action must be taken. John Torode\u2019s contract on MasterChef will not be renewed.\u201d\nIn a statement on Instagram on Tuesday, Torode said: \u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t heard from anyone at the BBC or Banijay, I am seeing and reading that I\u2019ve been \u2018sacked\u2019 from MasterChef and I repeat that I have no recollection of what I\u2019m accused of. The enquiry could not even state the date or year of when I am meant to have said something wrong.\n\u201cI\u2019d hoped that I\u2019d have some say in my exit from a show I\u2019ve worked on since its relaunch in 2005, but events in last few seem to have prevented that.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cPersonally I have loved every minute working on MasterChef, but it\u2019s time to pass the cutlery to someone else. For whoever takes over, love it as I have.\u201d\nThe report on Wallace, commissioned by Banijay UK, found that 45 out of 83 allegations against him were substantiated, alongside two standalone allegations made against other people.\nWallace, 60, was sacked last week from MasterChef before the release of the report, which included one allegation of \u201cunwelcome physical contact\u201d that was upheld. He said he was \u201cdeeply sorry for any distress caused\u201d and that he had \u201cnever set out to harm or humiliate\u201d.\nMasterChef was relaunched in 2005 with Torode and Wallace as presenters. The latest development means Torode\u2019s time at MasterChef is in effect over already as the 2025 series has already been shot and delivered to the BBC, though it has not been aired. Torode will not be contracted for any more episodes.\nHis departure creates an even greater problem for the BBC director general, Tim Davie, over the current, unaired series of the show. He was already facing a tough decision over whether or not to air it, as Wallace features prominently throughout.\nThe Guardian revealed Wallace appears as a judge right up until the series finale. It was only then that he stood back from the role amid allegations over his behaviour. Torode features throughout the whole series.\nSpeaking at the launch of the BBC\u2019s annual report, Davie said he had not made a decision over the series but he was mindful of the contestants who had worked hard throughout it.\n\u201cOne of my overwhelming concerns is that we\u2019ve got all the amateur chefs that gave their heart and soul to this programme,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to reflect on that, talk to them \u2013 and I\u2019m sure Banijay are doing that \u2013 consult them, think about the audience, and then make a call. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going through now.\u201d\nHe said there was a future for the show despite the allegations against Wallace and Torode. Production has only recently moved to new studios. \u201cA great programme that\u2019s well loved by audiences is much bigger than individuals,\u201d Davie said.\nIn an interview with BBC News on Tuesday evening, Davie said he saw the situation as an opportunity for the corporation to \u201creset\u201d.\nHe said he was not directly involved with the matter but had been told about the recommendation not to renew Torode\u2019s contract and was \u201chappy that the team were taking action\u201d.\nDavie added: \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we are taking this seriously. It\u2019s a reset where we make sure that people are living up to the values we expect across the board.\u201d\nAsked exactly what Torode was alleged to have said, the BBC\u2019s director general replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you the exact term because I think, frankly, it was serious racist term, a serious racist term, which does not get to be acceptable in any way, shape or form.\u201d"

      "text": "A report on the behaviour of Gregg Wallace has substantiated 45 allegations made against the former BBC presenter, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact.\nA seven-month investigation into the MasterChef presenter\u2019s behaviour covered 83 allegations against him, of which more than half were substantiated. The BBC confirmed Wallace would not be returning to any of its programmes and admitted that opportunities had been missed to deal with his behaviour.\nMost of the substantiated allegations related to inappropriate sexual language and humour. An overview of the report, however, said a \u201csmaller number of allegations of other inappropriate language and being in a state of undress were also substantiated\u201d.\nThe production company Banijay and the BBC said the number of sustained allegations made Wallace\u2019s return to MasterChef untenable, despite his recent diagnosis as autistic.\nWallace has already admitted using inappropriate language. In a statement after the report was released, he said he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the distress he had caused, but he had \u201cnever set out to harm or humiliate\u201d.\n\u201cFor eight months, my family and I have lived under a cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cTrial by media, fuelled by rumour and clickbait. None of the serious allegations against me were upheld. I challenged the remaining issue of unwanted touching, but have had to accept a difference in perception, and I am deeply sorry for any distress caused. It was never intended.\n\u201cA late autism diagnosis has helped me understand how I communicate and how I\u2019m perceived. I\u2019m still learning. Banijay have given me great support, and I thank them. But in the end, the BBC left me exposed to trial by media and the damage it leaves in its wake.\u201d\nHe said he was considering his next move with \u201cfull legal support\u201d.\nThe report summary revealed 10 other standalone allegations made against other people, two of which were substantiated \u2013 one relating to swearing and one to racist language. The BBC said it took those findings \u201cvery seriously and we have asked Banijay UK to take action to address these issues, which is under way. This will be completed as a priority.\u201d\nOn Monday night MasterChef presenter John Torode confirmed he was the subject of an allegation of using racist language.\nIn a post on Instagram, Torode said: \u201cFor the sake of transparency, I confirm that I am the individual who is alleged to have used racial language on one occasion. The allegation is that I did so sometime in 2018 or 2019, in a social situation, and that the person I was speaking with did not believe that it was intended in a malicious way and that I apologised immediately afterwards.\n\u201cI have absolutely no recollection of any of this, and I do not believe that it happened. However, I want to be clear that I\u2019ve always had the view that any racial language is wholly unacceptable in any environment. I\u2019m shocked and saddened by the allegation as I would never wish to cause anyone any offence.\u201d\nThe culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the allegations against Wallace were \u201chorrendous and appalling\u201d and welcomed the BBC\u2019s decision to end its association with him. She said the case highlighted the fact that more needed to be done to protect workers in the creative industries, who often work on a freelance basis.\nThe chair of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, Caroline Dinenage, said there had been a \u201clongstanding failure to protect people against unacceptable workplace behaviour\u201d.\n\u201cMost complaints were not raised with Mr Wallace himself, suggesting a reluctance to confront this head on and risk upsetting the on-screen talent,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen complainants still find it easier to go to the press rather than use internal processes, there is clearly still a long way to go.\u201d\nBanijay and the BBC said their complaints processes had improved since most of the allegations took place. The report, overseen by the law firm Lewis Silkin, was ordered by Banijay last year after BBC News said it had heard allegations of inappropriate sexual comments and inappropriate behaviour from 13 people who had worked with Wallace over a 17-year period. He stood back from his MasterChef role at that point.\nThe investigation heard evidence from 78 witnesses, including 41 complainants. All the report\u2019s findings were linked to allegations made in connection to MasterChef. It found the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the 83 allegations it heard (94%) related to behaviour that was said to have occurred between 2005 and 2018.\nIt found that 11 complaints or concerns had been raised about Wallace\u2019s behaviour between 2005 and last year. Some were raised with Banijay, others with the BBC. The majority were dealt with informally.\n\u201cThe production company undertook an investigation into an allegation in 2015 and understood the complainant was happy with the outcome,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe BBC intervened in response to a complaint in 2017, following which Mr Wallace was warned of the need to change his behaviour. Mr Wallace took steps to heed that warning.\u201d\nKaren Baxter, a partner and head of investigations at Lewis Silkin, said Wallace had been \u201ccooperative and forthcoming\u201d. He was interviewed three times over more than 14 hours. The report\u2019s findings were made based on the civil standard of proof \u2013 on the balance of probabilities \u2013 rather than the criminal threshold, beyond all reasonable doubt.\nIt said Wallace\u2019s neurodiversity diagnosis was considered \u201chighly relevant in the context of the findings made, particularly regarding his use of humour as a \u2018masking\u2019 technique and his difficulty in reading social cues. Mr Wallace accepts that his diagnosis may help to explain some of his actions, but he does not wish to hide behind it.\u201d\n\u201cMr Wallace was consistently described as energetic, humorous, and generally able to put contestants at ease, which contributed to the show\u2019s success,\u201d it found. \u201cHowever, these interactions and some comments made within earshot of contestants or colleagues sometimes resulted in offence and/or left people feeling uncomfortable.\u201d\nWith Wallace dropped by the BBC, its director general, Tim Davie, has to decide whether or not to show the new series of MasterChef, most of which was recorded before the presenter stood aside from the role. The BBC said it had not made a final decision on what to do.\nThe chief executive of Banijay UK, Patrick Holland, said: \u201cWe are extremely sorry to anyone who has been impacted by this behaviour and felt unable to speak up at the time or that their complaint was not adequately addressed.\u201d"

      "text": "The BBC is facing mounting pressure to scrap this year\u2019s series of MasterChef after the sacking of the presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode.\nThe heads of the broadcast union Bectu and a leading women\u2019s rights organisation have joined those calling for the series to be shelved, arguing it would cause distress to the people who had made complaints about the two men.\nLast week the BBC said it would broadcast a series of MasterChef featuring Wallace and Torode, which was filmed before the presenters were dropped after allegations about their behaviour were upheld.\nThe corporation said it was not \u201can easy decision\u201d, but argued it was the \u201cright thing to do\u201d for the amateur chefs who had taken part, adding that the show\u2019s producers had spoken to contestants about airing the programme.\nBut on Friday the head of Bectu, Philippa Childs, said the BBC should reconsider its decision.\n\u201cWhilst the BBC claims that it has consulted with contestants there appears to have been no consultation with complainants; freelancers who have taken the very difficult step of speaking out and who will legitimately feel distressed,\u201d she told BBC News. \u201cIf [the BBC] are serious about addressing this industry-wide problem, broadcasters should not reward bad behaviour with primetime coverage.\u201d\nPenny East, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, suggested it would be better to edit the presenters out entirely. \u201cSeeing Gregg Wallace on our screens will be deeply uncomfortable for many people, not least the brave women who have spoken about his appalling behaviour,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be right that men who sexually harass women continue to be given a platform and allowed to maintain their profile and power.\u201d\nWallace was dropped by the BBC after an independent report substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact. He has apologised \u201cfor any distress caused\u201d and said the report cleared him of \u201cthe most serious and sensational accusations\u201d.\nTorode was dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over the use of racist language, which he believes never happened.\nOn Thursday the Guardian revealed that one of the contestants from the latest series of MasterChef had been edited out of the programme, after telling its producers she did not want the show to be broadcast.\nSarah Shafi, from Leeds, said she told the show\u2019s producers that airing it would send the wrong message about the treatment of women.\nShe said she initially rejected an offer by MasterChef\u2019s producers, Banijay, to edit her out of her episode. The 57-year-old agreed to be removed once the BBC announced it had decided to broadcast the series from 6 August.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say edit me out,\u201d she said. \u201cI said: \u2018Axe the show, don\u2019t air the show. I\u2019m asking you not to air the show.\u2019 Prominent figures have been abusing their power. What message does that send out to women?\u201d\nOne former MasterChef worker who said she had been groped by Wallace told BBC News the decision to broadcast the series showed \u201ca blatant disregard for the people who have come forward\u201d.\nAnother person who worked on the show, and who said Wallace pulled his trousers down in front of her, said the decision to air the series was \u201cprofoundly disrespectful\u201d to people who had made complaints. \u201cIt ultimately sends a message that such behaviour can be overlooked,\u201d she said."

      "text": "A contestant from the latest series of MasterChef has been edited out of the programme, after telling its producers she did not want the show to be broadcast after sustained allegations made against presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode.\nSarah Shafi, from Leeds, said she had made it clear to the show\u2019s producers that airing it would send the wrong message about the treatment of women and the lack of challenge to powerful men behaving inappropriately.\nThe presenters feature almost throughout the series, which was filmed at the end of last year. Both have since been dropped from the programme.\nShafi said she initially rejected an offer by MasterChef\u2019s producers Banijay to edit her out of her episode. The 57-year-old agreed to be removed once the BBC announced they had decided to broadcast the series from 6 August.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say edit me out,\u201d she said. \u201cI said: \u2018Axe the show, don\u2019t air the show. I\u2019m asking you not to air the show.\u2019 Prominent figures have been abusing their power. What message does that send out to women?\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about the enabling environment. It\u2019s that complicity. Those individual powerful men do not [act] in isolation. There is an enabling environment, turning a blind eye \u2026 It\u2019s about years of these institutions not being accountable.\u201d\nWallace was dropped by the BBC after an independent report substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact.

It culminated in \u201cquite a heated conversation\u201d with a producer.\nShe said she was urged to think about the life-changing opportunity the show provided to some contestants. Shafi was then told about the \u201cpotential solution\u201d to edit her out of the programme.\n\u201cI was flabbergasted, because in what way was that a solution \u2013 and a solution for whom?\u201d Shafi said. \u201cMy point was not about me not being associated with it. My point was about the institutional enabling environment. I said I am completely against this airing of the show. I object to it strongly. This is the principle I\u2019m standing by. I\u2019m objecting to the show being aired, not about me being in it.\u201d\nShe agreed to be edited out once the BBC publicly confirmed the series would be shown.\nWhen the BBC announced the decision to press ahead with the series, it acknowledged \u201cnot everyone will agree\u201d and that doing so \u201cin no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters\u201d.\nShafi said: \u201cWhile the BBC are signalling how life changing, for the better, this could be for some contestants \u2013 I\u2019d say top 10 at most \u2013 where is the respect for how life changing, for the worse, it has been for the victims?\n\u201cWhat I suggested to them was: \u2018Why don\u2019t you do a special show dedicated to these people that excludes those prominent figures \u2013 but it focuses on the talent?\u2019\u201d\nThe BBC reiterated its decision to air the series was not an easy one. \u201cBanijay consulted with all the contestants before that decision was made and there was widespread support for it going ahead,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are sorry that this contestant does not support the decision and we are grateful she raised this with both the BBC and Banijay.\u201d\nA Banijay UK spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry that Sarah does not support the decision to air this series of MasterChef.
