      "summary": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that President Trump’s second term would bring a militarized America, a prediction that appears to have come true as National Guard troops are now patrolling Washington, D.C. and potentially other cities such as Chicago. Trump has deployed roughly 2,000 armed Guard members to the capital, citing crime reductions, while critics argue the moves are partisan and exaggerated. The deployment has sparked backlash from local leaders, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who called it an abuse of power, and has raised legal and constitutional questions about federal authority over city policing.",
