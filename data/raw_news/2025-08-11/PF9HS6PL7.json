  "content": "NORFOLK \u2014 Bilal Muhammad was on the phone with his son, Ali, when the trouble began.\n\nDuring testimony Monday in Norfolk Circuit Court, Muhammed told jurors he\u2019d called his son the night of June 29, 2023, to make sure he was up and headed to work, just as he did most nights that Ali was working.\n\nOnce Ali got to the parking lot of his apartment building, he told his father another car was blocking his vehicle.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018This guy got me blocked in,\u2019 and \u2018This guy won\u2019t move his car,'\u201d Muhammad testified. Next, he heard Ali repeatedly ask someone to \u201c\u2018Get that gun out of my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, have mercy. I\u2019m praying,\u201d Muhammad told jurors. \u201c\u2018Will you please get that gun out of my face?\u2019 Then pop. Just like that. Just like that.\u201d\n\nMuhammad never heard another word from his son. Ali Muhammad, 33 and the father of three young girls, had been shot once in the chest.\n\nMuhammad called 911, then he and his wife, Cynthia, rushed to Ali\u2019s apartment on 1st Bay Street in the Ocean View area. By the time they arrived, Ali had been pronounced dead.\n\nMuhammad\u2019s testimony came on the first day of trial for Jalen Garces. The 30-year-old Virginia Beach man is charged with second-degree murder and using a firearm to commit a felony.\n\nSon of anti-violence activist shot and killed in Norfolk: \u2018He was trying to go to work\u2019\n\nAlso testifying Monday was a woman who was in the parking lot when the shooting happened. She told jurors she was sitting in her rental car, looking at her phone, when she heard people arguing.\n\nShe said she looked up, saw two people standing near a car, then looked back down at her phone. Moments later, she heard a single shot. When she looked up again, she saw one person get into the driver\u2019s seat of a dark-colored Mustang and drive away. The other person was lying face-down in a pool of blood. She called 911, gave a description of the car to the dispatcher, as well as the direction it was headed.\n\nDuring opening statements, Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Liane Galardi told jurors the description she provided of the fleeing car \u2014 as well as the direction it was going \u2014 was crucial to the case.\n\nInvestigators located footage from Flock camera surveillance systems to track down the license plate on a black Mustang that had been in the area at the time of the shooting, Galardi said. Surveillance footage recorded that same night at a Wawa convenience store and a Virginia ABC liquor store showed it was Garces who was driving it.\n\nVirginia Beach police pulled Garces over in the Mustang a couple of days later, arrested him, and seized the car. Data download from the car, as well as from Garces\u2019 cell phone, showed he was at the scene when the shooting happened, Galardi said.\n\n\u201cThat car tells us that he killed Ali,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nDefense attorney Daymen Robinson told jurors Garces wasn\u2019t involved in the shooting. He suggested that two other residents of the apartment building who\u2019d previously had altercations with Ali may have been responsible.\n\nRobinson said detectives became so hyper-focused on the Mustang, that they failed to consider other possibilities.\n\n\u201cThey had this one piece of evidence and they tied their entire case to it,\u201d the defense lawyer said.\n\nTestimony in the trial is set to resume Tuesday. It\u2019s expected to last three to four days.",
