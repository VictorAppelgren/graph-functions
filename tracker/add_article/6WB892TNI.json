      "title": "Controversial $250 Visa Integrity Fee Will Cost US $11 Billion As It Deters Tourists, Analysts Say",
      "summary": "The new $250 visa integrity fee, slated to begin in 2026, is expected to deter about 5.4% of international visitors, potentially cutting roughly 1 million trips and $29 billion in tourism revenue, according to tourism economists, while the CBO projects only $2.7 billion in fee revenue because it ignores macroeconomic feedback.  The fee comes amid a broader Trump‑era push that includes a possible expansion of the travel ban to 36 more countries, a $80 million cut to Brand USA’s marketing budget, and heightened scrutiny of U.S. border enforcement—all of which are eroding the country’s appeal to foreign travelers.  These policies threaten to undermine the projected $30.5 billion economic boost from the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as host cities rely on a 50/50 split of domestic and international fans to fill stadiums and hotels.  Overall, the combination of higher fees, stricter bans, and reduced marketing is likely to keep U.S. tourism on a downward trajectory for years to come.",
