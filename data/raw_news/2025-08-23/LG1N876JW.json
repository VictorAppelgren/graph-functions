  "content": "5 Settings You Should Immediately Change On Your iPad Pro\n\nThe iPad Pro works great right out of the box, and many people enjoy using it with the default settings. However, some users don't realize that there are certain settings and features they can enable to make their device even better. For example, some settings can help your iPad last longer on a full charge. Others can protect your battery's health in the long run, so you don't see a big drop in performance after a year or two. A few simple changes can also help you avoid distractions, like endless notifications while trying to focus. If you use your iPad for work or multitasking, some settings can help you get more done in less time. The best part is that you don't need to be a tech expert to make these changes. Most of them are just simple toggle buttons buried in the settings menu, and you can turn them on or off in less than a minute. In this guide, we'll walk you through five simple settings you should consider changing on your iPad Pro, making your tablet feel faster and more useful.\n\nOne of the best settings you can turn on right away is the 80% charging limit. The iPad Pro has a great battery life, and you don't need to charge it again and again throughout the day. If you want the battery to stay healthy and last longer over time, this setting can really help. When your iPad charges all the way to 100% and stays there for long periods, it adds extra stress on the battery. Over time, that can slowly reduce how well the battery holds a charge. Apple actually designs iPad batteries to keep up to 80% of their original capacity after around 1000 full charge cycles. That's a lot, but you can help it stay strong even longer by reducing how often it charges to full. With the 80% limit turned on, your iPad will stop charging once it hits 80%. This might seem like a small change, but it makes a big difference as the battery doesn't get pushed to its limit, which helps reduce wear over time. Your iPad will still function normally, and for most people who use their device around the house or in the office, that 80% charge is more than enough to get through the day. To switch it on, go to Settings, tap Battery, followed by Battery Health, and toggle on the 80% Limit.\n\nAnother setting worth turning on is Speak Selection. It's a simple feature that is really helpful if you're working with long documents or want to reduce eye strain. With the feature enabled, your iPad can read text out loud for you. Whether it's an email, a webpage, a document, or even a book, all you have to do is select the text and tap the \"Speak\" button that pops up. This can be useful if you're proofreading something you've written or just want to sit back and listen instead of reading. To enable it, click Settings, tap Accessibility, and look for \"Spoken Content.\" Inside that menu, turn on Speak Selection. Once that's on, you'll start seeing the Speak option whenever you highlight text anywhere across the screen. This feature is even better because of its customizability. Several voice options are available, and you can easily switch between them from the Spoken Content section. There's also an option to adjust the speaking rate, which lets you control how fast or slow the iPad reads the text. You can slow it down for better understanding, or speed it up if you're trying to get through long documents quickly.\n\nOne thing most people don't think about when they start screen sharing on their iPad Pro is that their notifications are still coming in, and everyone can see them. You may be presenting in a meeting or showing some pictures to your friends or family, when suddenly a message pops up with something you'd rather keep private. By default, the iPad shows your notifications even when you're mirroring your screen. The good news is that a built-in setting prevents this from happening. All you have to do is head to Settings, tap on Notifications, and open the Screen Sharing section. Here, you'll find a toggle to turn off notifications while screen sharing. After you turn this setting off, your iPad will keep alerts private while you're sharing your screen. Whether you're presenting slides or showing a video, you won't have to worry about unexpected messages popping up. It's a small change but can help you avoid awkward interruptions. It also makes your presentation look more professional, as the people watching won't get distracted by random alerts, calendar reminders, or social media updates. Instead, they'll stay focused on what you're showing.\n\nIf you like multitasking or often find yourself juggling between apps, Stage Manager is a setting you'll want to keep turned on. It makes your iPad Pro feel more like a desktop, as it lets you switch between apps, resize windows, and organize your workspace however you prefer, making it great for both students and professionals. With Stage Manager, your main app stays in the center of the screen, while your other open apps sit on the side, making it easy to switch between them quickly. Thanks to this, you don't have to worry about digging through the menu or swiping endlessly just to find that one browser tab or note. You can also group multiple apps together in one view, which makes multitasking much easier. For example, you can write while checking notes or edit a document with a browser open beside it. You're not limited to split screen either, as you can resize and overlap the windows freely, which makes the iPad feel more like a laptop than a tablet. And if you pair it with a mouse and keyboard, everything works even more smoothly. Each app window also comes with a small three-dot button at the top, and tapping it brings up options to go full screen, add another app to the group, minimize the app, or close it entirely. To enable Stage Manager, go to Settings, tap on Multitasking & Gestures, and turn it on.\n\nTurn off notifications and background app refresh for specific apps While the iPad Pro already offers a long battery life, there are a few small tweaks you can make to help it last even longer, which include managing your app notifications and background activity. Too many notifications can drain your battery faster than you think. If your iPad is lighting up for 150 alerts a day instead of just 50, that's a huge difference in how much power it's using to stay active. Every time a notification comes in, your iPad has to wake up, play a sound, and possibly run background activity, and that slowly drains the battery. To fix this, go to Settings, tap Notifications, and scroll through your list of apps. Most of them will have alerts turned on by default. Just tap on the apps you don't need to hear from all the time, like YouTube, Netflix, or Spotify, and turn their notifications off. Another simple tweak is limiting which apps are allowed to refresh in the background. This feature allows apps to stay updated even when you're not using them. While that's useful for email and messaging apps, it's unnecessary for games or apps you rarely open. To do this, you need to open Settings, tap on General, and select Background App Refresh. Here, you'll see a list of all your apps, and you can tap on each one to choose whether to turn Background App Refresh on or off.",

      "text": "6 Ways To Keep Your iPad Battery From Draining So Fast\niPads have great battery life. The iPad Mini, the razor-thin iPad Pro, the latest 11th Generation iPad (2025), and the iPad Air 7 (2025) all get roughly 10 hours of screen-on time. Or at least, they should. Anecdotally, a lot of users have noticed that iPads don't have the best standby time; they can lose up to 10% a day when left unused and idling. Apple's advertised 10-hour max may start to seem like false marketing, even when you use your iPad only for lightweight tasks \u2014 like, as is tradition, using it as a Netflix machine. If you're okay with taking matters into your own hands, however, you can eke out a little more than most from your iPad's battery.\nLet's get one thing straight: We're not going to give you silly battery-saving tips like setting screen brightness to 10%, leaving you straining your eyes just to save a couple percent of battery. You should be able to enjoy your iPad. Battery life can be saved without cutting all those little battery-draining bells and whistles that make it fun to use. Keeping that in mind, everything we're going to recommend here today keeps your device fully functional while suggesting a few small changes that could prolong the overall battery life. Here are six tips to get the most out of your iPad's battery.\nTurn on Airplane Mode and Low Power Mode when not in use\nYeah, yeah, it sounds like we're going back already on the very first thing we said: not making your iPad unenjoyable to use. However, this tip is for people who use the iPad in a limited capacity every day (for a couple of hours at most) and then set it down until the next day \u2014 not for an iPad getting heavy daily mileage. People who use their iPad as a Netflix machine, this is probably for you. It improves the standby duration mentioned earlier. I've personally ensured my iPad only loses a couple of percentage points of battery a day by doing this.\nAirplane Mode can be enabled from the control center. It's a one-touch solution for turning off Wi-Fi, cellular, and Bluetooth \u2014 all battery-draining connectivity features. Just be aware this will cause features like Find My not to work. Low Power Mode, aside from reducing the screen's refresh rate and brightness, will limit background activities (like push notifications) to save battery. If you're really dedicated, you can use this trick to keep your iPad in low power mode all the time using Shortcuts. If you're not going to use your iPad for a week or longer, just turn it off.\nNaturally, this means that every time you disable Airplane Mode and Low Power Mode, your iPad will have to catch up on everything it missed. My iPad quietly retrieves all its notifications in about a minute or two while I'm getting to work. Some apps (like note-taking apps) may need to be opened to update, but that's likely not an issue if you use your iPad so rarely.\nLimit background app refresh\nMost apps are automatically granted permission to run in the background once you install them \u2014 receiving messages, retrieving notifications, updating local content, and so on. Over months or years, your iPad could be filled with dozens of apps vying for system resources, even when you're not doing anything. Apple has said that closing iPhone apps does not stop battery drain for years. The same applies to the iPad. Go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and turn off the toggles for any apps that don't need to run in the background.\nI've disabled background refresh for about half the apps on my iPad. Things like the Apple Store (not the App Store), Apple's productivity apps (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote), Google Docs and Google Sheets, and more. In general, I'd recommend disabling anything you don't need notifications from or don't open frequently. There are even apps I open every day that I don't give background permissions; my vocab app Anki (one of iPhone's most popular paid iOS apps) only syncs when in focus, making background sync largely pointless. Leave anything enabled that's involved with an important account, like a banking or work-related app.\nKeep in mind this doesn't mean you'll stop notifications from affected apps altogether. I still get them from disabled apps. This tip is more to stop any unnecessary background activity that's eating up battery. You can always re-enable background app refresh if needed. For a less extreme solution, consider setting up notification summaries, so you get one batch of notifications at a scheduled time instead of a battery-draining trickle throughout the day.\nUse dark mode (on OLED)\nThe iPad Pro M4 was the biggest refresh to the iPad lineup in years, adding one of its longest-awaited features: an OLED screen. OLED is a great choice for TVs (and really any other device) because of excellent contrast and vivid colors. Additionally, OLED pixels can switch off entirely, which is why blacks on OLED look amazing, and it's one reason why OLED screens consume less power. So what's the tip here? If you have the iPad Pro M4 with OLED (or future OLED models), consider using dark mode to save battery. Tests on OLED screens show that apps can sometimes cut power consumption by up to two-thirds in dark mode. Just keep in mind that there's no benefit to using dark mode on the LCD screen common in most iPad models.\nOf course, actual power savings depend on which apps you use. The majority of apps on iPad now support dark mode. Apps with pitch-black dark mode are preferable, as those pixels produce no light on OLED. Aside from being good for nighttime use, dark mode may have other benefits like reducing eye strain and blue light exposure.\nSome people love dark mode, some hate it, and some like both. If you like both, consider scheduling dark mode to enable automatically. Go to Settings > Display & Brightness, then toggle on \"Automatic\" under the Appearance section. It'll then use light mode during the day and dark mode at night. Under the options section, you can also set a custom schedule.\nDisable any unneeded features\nThere are a ton of features on iPad that you probably aren't using and wouldn't notice if disabled. Here are a few you can switch off to save some battery. First up, Handoff. Handoff lets you continue tasks between your Mac and iPad, such as browsing a specific webpage. If you don't use this (or don't have a Mac), turn it off in Settings > General > Airplay & Continuity.\nAirdrop is amazing, but you may hardly use it on a secondary device like an iPad. Most of your files likely sync through iCloud anyway. To disable AirDrop, go to Settings > General > AirDrop and set it to \"Receiving Off\" so your iPad isn't using battery to stay available. You can also do this quickly through the Control Center.\nThe Apple Mail app is good enough for basic email needs, but it does not support automatic push notifications for providers like Gmail. Instead, you either have to manually refresh your email or set fetch intervals that check for mail every 15 minutes \u2014 or less often. Apple warns that frequent fetching can be battery intensive. If you're okay with manually retrieval, then go to Settings > Apps > Mail > Mail Accounts and change the Fetch New Data setting to Manually. Lastly, disable location permissions for apps that don't require it in Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services.\nKeep to the 40-80% rule\nYour iPad may have bad battery life because its battery is worn out. A common mistake everyone makes with the batteries is letting them drain all the way and then charging to 100%. For maximum longevity, a lithium-ion battery should be kept between 40% and 80% battery as much as is reasonably possible. This can be difficult since you may not use your iPad enough to track the battery level and may be tempted to just leave it plugged in all the time.\nThere are two very good reasons why you should stick to the 40-80 rule. One, you'll probably be hanging onto your iPad for a lot longer than your phone; the expected lifespan of an iPad is up to seven years, and we'd wager most people replace iPads less even than laptops. Two, iPad battery replacements aren't cheap without Apple Care. Since you're probably not using your iPad as often as a phone, simply maintaining it between 40% and 80% can easily make the battery last for as long as it gets software updates.\nThe easiest way to keep an iPad from overcharging is to enable the 80% charge limit. Unfortunately, only the new iPad Pro M4 and iPad Air M2 include this feature; it's unlikely this setting will trickle down to other iPad models. Luckily, there's a workaround. One of the daily activities I automate with my iPhone (which also works on the iPad) is a Shortcut that tells me when my battery hits 40% and 80%. So if my iPad is on the charger, I can get a notification (or hear from across the room) when it's reached 80%, and then unplug it.\nCheck your battery usage to diagnose the issue\nIs your battery draining way faster than it should, but you're not sure why? Here's a quick way to self-diagnose the issue. Head to Settings > Battery and you'll see the last 24 hours (or last ten days) of usage on a per-app basis. This battery usage chart helpfully tells you how much (in minutes) you've been using your device, what the charge level was throughout the day, and more.\nThe battery settings also tell you how long the screen was active versus idle, how many minutes each app was used, and what percentage of battery each one consumed. Apps used while your device was charging aren't counted. Apps being used in the background are noted as such. Keep in mind that you can tap on any hour throughout the day to see exact battery usage for that time.\nThis is an extremely helpful tool for pinpointing the main culprit of a fast-draining battery. It's often apps you don't use much, but that still show high usage and background activity. Or it could be an app you actively use that's simply poorly optimized. If an app uses a disproportionate amount of battery compared to another app used for a similar time \u2014 and it doesn't seem like it should \u2014 you've got your culprit. Either limit its background activity, disable energy-intensive features in the settings, or delete it in favor of a better-optimized alternative."

      "text": "iPad Pro M4 Review (2024): More Power Than You'll Need, Less Than You Want\nThere are certain machines that need to be experienced firsthand to realize their potential and real-life efficacy. In 2024, no device is more deserving of that honor than the M4 iPad Pro. The hardware is dreamy, the firepower underneath is a notch higher than in its predecessor, and the display is dazzling. This is an altogether splendid piece of hardware, to be sure.\nApple has left no stone unturned to make its latest slate, and then extended the same treatment to the accompanying keyboard accessory as well as the stylus. Every piece feels like a complete reimagination, a kit that is unabashedly aimed at destroying the tablet competition. Or making its user base forget the competition exists.\nBut this is an Apple machine, and some caveats come with it. The stakes are even higher this year, all thanks to the sweet price hike. Here's my experience of pushing this machine and how it fared on Apple's tall claims.\nExcellent hardware\nThe 2024 iPad Pro is thin, more so than a slate this powerful has any right to be. With a cross-section of just 5.1 millimeters and a weight of 1.27 pounds (579 grams) for the 13-inch version, this is one of the slimmest machines out there. Yes, you won't always be carrying this machine in your hands, but when you do, it won't make your arms regret the decision. Apple has once again used 100% recycled aluminum for the slate's enclosure and offers it in two familiar colors \u2014 silver and space black.\nThe metallic shell does a good job keeping smudges at bay, but I would strongly recommend putting a skin or a protective shell on it. Scuff marks look ugly, especially on the silver version. I have a silver 10th gen iPad that serves as a painful reminder of my wayward ways with protecting gadgets. Moreover, I don't trust Apple gear with metal kits, especially around the corners and edges. My M3 MacBook Air is barely two months old, and already has a healthy few spots on the edges where the paint has scratched, exposing the scarred silvery metal underneath.\nTo Apple's credit, the iPad Pro's weight balance is great and you can easily carry the slate around in your arms for note-taking or other such chores. Another practical change that Apple has made this time around is a horizontally-aligned front camera. It should've been the obvious choice from the start, especially when Apple is pushing the iPad Pro as a legitimate workhorse that even apes the looks of a laptop. Oh, the ultrawide camera has also gone missing as Apple embarked on a crusade to engineer its \"thinnest device ever.\"\nA fantastic display\nOne of the biggest draws is the new Ultra Retina XDR display is the underlying tandem OLED tech. I'll start with the bad part first. It's amazingly glossy and loves to attract smudges. If you can't live that visual woe, Apple would kindly take your $200 for a nano-etched textured glass coat. It solves the reflective glare problem, but seen side by side, this one looks less appealing in terms of color saturation and is therefore arguably not an ideal choice for color-obsessed creative folks.\nOn the bright side, this time around, the OLED love is shared across both sizes, unlike the mini-LED generation, which was exclusive only to the bigger 12.9-inch model. This is one of the nicest screens you will come across, and it's due to a combination of both hardware and OS-level optimizations. The screen delivers excellent colors married to great viewing angles and terrific sharpness.\nShifting my workflow between an M3 MacBook Air, an assembly of two ultrawide monitors on my desk, and the iPad Pro, I actually found myself gravitating towards the new Apple slate more than any other machine. Now, I am not sure if creative folks would really use the iPad Pro as a reference screen, despite Apple's best intentions to market it as such. I asked an award-winning video journalist about it, and they simply laughed off the idea. \"Dude, that 13-inch size is too small,\" they told me.\nTandem OLED tech\nNow that we are talking screens, let's get into a bit of science here. Tandem OLED is not another tongue-twisting marketing jargon. Display stacking in a tandem arrangement is an innovative tech that brings more benefits than just boosting the sheer brilliance of a panel. There have been multiple experiments with chemical variations for the inherent charge generation layer, but the benefits are quite diverse. At the fundamental level, a tandem layer is essentially two OLED panels stacked atop each other, while the connection between them is driven by charge generation layers.\nBut what's wrong with a single OLED layer? Well, the magnitude of current that can be injected into a single OLED stack is limited, and it can't reach high luminance figures. On a tandem OLED stack, depending on the light extraction design at play, the light extraction efficiency can be enhanced by up to three times. Thanks to the unique architecture, when external charge is applied, there is a multi-fold increase in the number of photons. As a result, the net brightness goes up, which is no small advantage.\nIn simple terms: compared to previous iPad Pros, the OLED panel on this device is brighter, sucks up less power, and will last longer.\nQuality tests\nThe peak brightness of 1,000 nits for SDR content, and 1,600 nits in HDR mode, beats the best smartphone OLEDs on the market today. That's nearly double that of the Asus ZenBook S13 OLED. But thanks to Apple's tight rules around animation and scaling at the OS-level, the 120Hz ProMotion panel on the iPad Pro makes every interaction feel smoother than any other device I've used. Using the EIZO monitor quality test, I analyzed the gray-scale uniformity at three linear gray tone levels and the RGB gradient test. The iPad Pro excelled in these tests and provided excellent results at the monotone gradient and viewing angle stability parameters.\nI worked with the iPad Pro as my primary workflow driver for about a week in a variety of scenarios: from a sofa in a pitch-dark room to a well-lit coffee shop and an open-sky college canteen. Save for the reflection issue, especially for eyes that have grown to love the dark mode, I would give the OLED panel a perfect score for visual fidelity and legibility. It is a joy to power it on and prop it atop the Magic Keyboard. The slimmer profile of the slate definitely helps the iPad towards its candidacy as the best portable screen available today, and a feature-packed stylus lends a helping hand, as well.\nI have worked for about two years on an 11-inch M1 iPad Pro, pushing it to its limits, and I can confidently say that the 13-inch screen is definitely the saner choice for getting serious work done. Thanks to the tight pixel-level control of an OLED panel, the blacks and contrast are outstanding. Indoors, the black bezels almost merge with the black background in certain apps.\nProcessing Power\nThe 2024 iPad Pro marks the introduction of the M4 silicon, which is based on TSMC's updated 3-nanometer process node. This one offers 10 GPU cores and an equal number of CPU cores, two more than the M2-fueled iPad Pro. The gains over the M2 are impressive, with Apple touting a 50% jump at raw CPU firepower, and matching performance at half the power draw. The memory bandwidth has also increased by a healthy 20%, reaching 120 Gbps on the M4 generation.\nBut for an average enthusiast, how much those speed gains matter rests squarely on the machine in their hands. If you have an M1 or M2-powered iPad in your hands, the M4 won't make any day and night difference in your workflow. I definitely feel that the M4 iPad Pro is snappier than the M1, but not enough to warrant a desperate jaunt to the Apple Store. On its own, however, the M4 is an outright beast. Photo and video edits in the Adobe Suite of apps were speedy. Even with about 20 apps in the background with Stage Manager enabled, this machine never stuttered or froze.\nBut you will see the difference in demanding apps. I fired up DaVinci Resolve and saw nearly a 3x improvement at the rendering pace of a sample 4K video edit with heavy effects applied. But remember to fork extra (a lot) cash on at least the 1TB storage version to get the 16GB RAM version for such workflows. Both \"Diablo Immortal\" and \"Call of Duty: Warzone\" really show how far the tablet's come over the past decade. You can confidently push every single graphics setting to the max, and have a gala gaming time on the M4 iPad Pro.\nLocked up silicon\nAll that talk of a nigh-peerless processor inside the iPad Pro is seriously undermined, as one of the worst parts of configuring a Mac makes the leap over to Apple's tablet. Remember how Apple will give you a less powerful version of its computing M-series silicon with fewer GPU cores if you buy one of the entry-level Mac configurations? Well, that undesirable situation has made its way to the iPad Pro, as well. For the first time in the iPad's history, Apple is offering two versions of the M4 silicon. The entry-tier version serves a 9-core CPU, while the higher-end version gives you 10 processing cores.\nThat extra (or missing) CPU core matters because it's one of the bigger hardware-accelerated cores that handle demanding workflows and not a low-power efficiency core. If you are looking to push the iPad Pro at demanding workflows, especially pro-grade video editing, that additional performance will definitely make a visible difference, and for reasons more than one.\nYou see, that extra performance core is not just a question of a few extra bucks. Instead, Apple has tied access to it behind the memory configuration. You will only get it if you pay for the 1TB storage version.\nThat means if you are eyeing the 256GB storage version, but want those 10 CPU cores, your bill goes up by $400, at the very least. I can't imagine a customer would be happy paying as much as $1,499 on an iPad Pro, only to be told that it contains a less-powerful M4 trim and just 8GB of RAM. Oh, the RAM situation. You will only get 16GB RAM if you pay for the 1TB storage variant of the iPad Pro, as usual.\nMagic Keyboard testing\nFor a couple of years, I have harbored a love-hate relationship with the Magic Keyboard. For a keyboard that pulls roughly $300 from your wallet, the black Magic Keyboard on my M1 iPad Pro blessed me with a peeling skin \u2014 and the glue right below the trackpad dried off, leaving an ugly exposed gap alongside the bottom edge. The updated Magic Keyboard wants to fix those critical flaws, and so far, the experience has been great.\nThe switch to an aluminum deck gives it a premium look, and gets it teasingly close to the MacBook aesthetics. The typing experience is noticeably better, and the addition of a function row key at the top is a meaningful change. The trackpad has also seen its dimensions stretched, and thanks to the arrival of a glass layer, executing swipe gestures or even mundane scrolling on it feels better. Button clicks are also more uniform across the trackpad. But the most notable upgrade is the addition of a haptic engine underneath. As soon as I set the iPad Pro for the first time, I enabled the tap system for the trackpad and got rid of physical clicks without regretting it.\nThe metallic ridge at the back is exposed now, which now means zero risk of any ugly skin peeling. I am just a tad bit skeptical of how the polish on it will hold in the long run. On the bad side of things, Apple won't let you manually adjust the backlight brightness of the keyboard under ample ambient light. Moreover, if you're using the whole kit on your lap, know that the deck won't rest still like an average laptop, thanks in no part to the top-heavy nature of the whole setup here.\nBattery testing\nThere's something curious going on here. The M4 iPad Pro is 22% thinner and about 16% lighter than its M2 counterpart. And yet, despite fitting in a smaller battery, Apple still touts a 10-hour battery for the latest iPad Pro. Now, those longevity figures are based on web surfing and watching video. But to my surprise, the tablet held pretty well even with far more demanding workflows.\nI had Chrome (with 42 tabs) open in split-view mode with Google Docs and Apple Notes, while having 21 apps in the background. There were four other multitasking app clusters in the background with Stage Manager enabled. The slate was connected to a pair of wireless earbuds and the brightness level was set to a comfortable 75% mark. In two hours, the net battery draw was exactly 23%, which is terrific and significantly better than what I usually get on an M1 iPad Pro.\nThis was when an Apple Pencil was also magnetically drawing some juice from the tablet, and the Magic Keyboard was consistently doing the same. The mileage might vary depending on the app you are running, particularly if they happen to be of the same caliber as Final Cut Pro or Adobe Illustrator. But for anything lighter, you can comfortably get about seven hours of battery juice with a fairly intensive workflow on a single charge.\nOverall, if you have the whole iPad Pro setup with a stylus and keyboard, it will very likely deliver the best battery longevity figure you will get on any other slate out there. Compared to my midrange OnePlus Pad and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8, the M4 iPad Pro is miles ahead in the battery department.\niPadOS isn't Mac OS\nWhat's the best way to justify hurting your wallet for the M4 iPad Pro? If it can run the apps that are central to your workflow. Think Procreate or Logic Pro. Or you need a stop-gap version for getting some work done on the go, like editing on Final Cut Pro or Adobe's Creative Suite. Otherwise, iPadOS will leave you frustrated. It's a stretched-out iOS to date, and that's a truly unfortunate scenario. Apple's improvements in processing power continue to outpace the software it works with.\nThere is still no native calculator app, nor one for a dictionary. I don't understand why the iPhone's Journal app hasn't yet arrived on iPadOS, either. The file manager continues to be difficult to work with, and you still can't set a default app for certain file types. You can't create app pairs (or triplets) for quickly getting back to your workflows, and Stage Manager would keep you limited to 4 apps. For all its \"desktop-tier silicon might,\" Apple won't give us something like Mission Control. Split-screen multiple-tasking is also fairly basic.\nNow, I won't demand Apple to let the iPad Pro dual-boot macOS, but it would be awesome for the experience to get more functionally unique, at long last.\nVerdict\nThe M4 iPad Pro has its merit, and it's undeniably in a league of its own. The looks and feel are a definite standout. The OLED display is a stunner, and so is the Magic Keyboard, both aesthetically as well as functionally. Performance is blistering, as expected, and the battery life is surprisingly good, especially for a slate with a 13-inch OLED panel. From a hardware perspective, there is almost nothing meaningful to complain about Apple's latest flagship slate.\nInterestingly, the biggest undoing of this beautiful kit is Apple itself. The iPadOS experience is still frustratingly limiting and the sluggish pace at which it is evolving further shrinks any scope of bright hopes. The iPad's getting closer to a Mac all the time \u2014 unfortunate for power users, that also goes for configuration pricing and top-tier M4 action. And unless your workflow doesn't involve stylus-based work, the Magic Keyboard is an expensive must-have to extract any iota of computing needs from this slate.\nIs this the best tablet out there? Without a doubt. But you should only buy it if your workflow needs an app that runs in its full-fledged avatar on this tablet. Or, you can live with a limited OS on a machine with power and aesthetics that far outpace its potential. There is no middle ground on this one \u2014 but if you happen to fall in that sweet spot of the M4 iPad Pro's target audience, go ahead and splurge."

      "text": "Here's How To Check Your iPad's Battery Health And History\nIt seems to happen with all devices: you notice you don't get as much charge as you used to, and your iPad starts dying at inopportune times. Maybe it powers off when you still have 20% left, or just doesn't make it through the day like it did when you first bought it. When these things start happening, you might question whether your battery is on its last legs and if you need to do something about it. There are quite a few things you should know before buying an iPad, used or new, but how to monitor its battery health and history probably isn't at the top of your list. That's because most of us don't think about our iPad's battery health until it's causing us problems.\nLike all rechargeable batteries, your iPad's battery will gradually lose capacity with regular use. Checking your iPad's battery health can help you figure out if it's time to get a new one or make small changes, like lowering the screen brightness or closing background apps, to get more out of it. If you own an iPad Pro (M4), iPad Air (M2 and M3), iPad mini (A17 Pro), or iPad (A16), you can view information about your battery's health, including its maximum capacity, cycle count, and manufacturing date, right in the Settings app. However, if you're using an older iPad, you won't find this information in the Settings menu. Still, there is a built-in workaround using iPad Analytics that can help you get an idea of your battery's health. Whether you're using a new iPad or an older model, knowing your battery's health can help you avoid surprise shutdowns or decide if you need to replace it.\nHow to check your iPad's battery health and history\nIf you're using a newer iPad like the iPad Pro M4, Apple makes it easy to check your battery's health. You won't have to install any special apps or connect your iPad to another device. Everything you need is built right into the Settings app. Checking this information will give you an idea of how your battery is performing and whether it's starting to lose its ability to hold a charge.\nFollow these steps to check your iPad's battery health and history:\n- Open the Settings menu on your iPad.\n- Tap Battery in the menu.\n- Select Battery Health.\nFrom there, you'll be able to see whether the battery is performing as expected, its maximum capacity, cycle count, and a toggle that lets you limit charging to 80%. Limiting the charge can help extend the battery's lifespan, especially if you tend to keep your iPad plugged in for long periods. You can use the information in the battery health section to determine if your battery is still in good shape and to stay ahead of potential battery issues.\nHow to check battery health on older iPads\nChecking your battery health and history on an older iPad requires a few more steps than on newer models, but it can be done. The expected lifespan of an iPad is five years on average, so there's a good chance you haven't updated to the latest model. While you can't check your battery's health in the Settings menu, there's a lesser-known workaround that will let you access detailed battery data using Apple's built-in Analytics log.\nFollow these steps to check your battery health using iPad Analytics:\n- Open Settings on your iPad.\n- Go to Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements.\n- Turn on Share iPad Analytics. You'll need to leave this on for at least 24 hours to allow the system to generate new logs.\n- After waiting, tap Analytics Data and open the most recent file starting with \"Analytics\u2013\".\n- In the log, search for last_value_MaximumCapacityPercent to see your battery's current maximum capacity.\nWhile this method does take a little more effort than what's required for new iPads, it's a good way to track battery health on older models that don't have a built-in Battery Health screen. However, if going through analytics logs feels like too much, you can connect your iPad to a Mac or PC and use apps like CoconutBattery or iMazing to check your cycle count and battery health quickly."

      "text": "The Most Essential iPad Features Every Student Will Wish They Knew Sooner\nOnce upon a time, technology was banned from classrooms, so students would be able to give their undivided attention to their teachers. At the time, cell phones were confiscated, laptops weren't as ubiquitous for notetaking, and students had to wait the next day to know if they failed their exams or not. These days, schools are requiring more from their students, so they're permitted an entire arsenal of tech tools to accomplish their tasks, including tablets like iPads.\nIn 2010, Steve Jobs launched the first generation iPad, which filled the gap between mobile phones and laptops. With its portability, reasonable screen size, and power that rivals some laptops, iPads have become a choice tool for students looking to get ahead in their academic lives.\nThere are hundreds of apps launched every year for students looking to make the most out of their iPads in school. However, before making any additional purchases, there are some built-in iPad features that may already fulfill students' needs.\nApple Pencil Integration\nWhile most iPad owners will already know about its Apple Pencil integration, not everyone knows how to make the most of it. For example, aside from taking notes, Apple Pencils can also be used for highlighting documents. This can be super helpful for students who rely on color coding for memorization, such as law students or medical students.\nIn addition, although the Apple Pencil can't sample real-world colors and textures yet, it does have some nifty features like handwriting recognition. Converting your notes to more legible text is a great way to make sure classmates can read your notes once you share them. Using the \"Scribble\" feature, you can even delete a part of the text you've typed by scratching it out using your Apple Pencil.\nTo enable the Scribble feature, open the Settings app on your iPad and select Apple Pencil. Under English, toggle on the button next to \"Scribble.\" In that menu, you can also customize what quick swipe features you'd like your Apple Pencil to have. Under Pencil Gestures, you can select either Quick Note or Screenshot when you swipe your Apple Pencil towards the left or right.\nIf you want the benefits of the Apple Pencil without its hefty price tag, there are also some Apple Pencil alternatives that can do a similar job.\nPDF Annotation\nWith the absurd costs of textbooks and printing, it makes sense that some schools are going digital with PDF copies. However, like in any school setting, there is always more to the lectures than what's simply found on the page.\nIf you ever catch yourself jotting down interesting information or rushing to write down quotes from your professor, you can easily make annotations on PDF using your iPad. To start annotating, launch the Pages app on your iPad. Next, open the document you want to annotate. Lastly, in the upper-right corner of the screen, press the three dots and tap \"Smart Annotation.\"\nAfterward, you'll be able to access several options for note-taking and annotating your PDFs, such as connecting with text, objects, or table cells. Once shared with others, recipients can also view your annotations or choose to delete them.\nShould you want to take it a step further, there are plenty of other great note-taking apps, like Notability and Goodnotes. With additional features, such as document scanning and separate notebooks, you can quickly annotate a physical document on your iPad and never have to worry about losing the physical copy again.\nFocus Mode\nHave you ever experienced showing a classmate your iPad screen when a private message notification pops up on the screen? Whether it's your mother giving you a lecture about trash you haven't taken out, or a message from someone you like, there are some messages we would rather not share with others.\nThankfully, Apple introduced Focus Mode on its iOS devices, including its iPad. Aside from keeping message notifications away from your screen, Focus Mode also helps notify people of your status or prevent non-essential apps from taking your attention away from learning.\nTo set up Focus mode on your iPad, open the Settings app and select \"Focus.\" From here, you can choose from the preset modes, such as Do Not Disturb, Personal, Sleep, or Work. Alternatively, you can also customize how you want your settings to fit your focus needs. For example, you can customize Focus Mode features for lectures, music rehearsals, or working out.\nSplit View\nIn an ideal world, one should be able to focus on one thing at a time. However, there are definitely moments where it's absolutely necessary to multitask as you work. For example, you may need your browser open while you're researching for a paper. Other times, you'll want to be able to take notes while recording a lecture. Either way, you'll be able to look at two things at once using your iPad Split View feature.\nWith Split View, you can use two apps simultaneously, right next to each other. To use Split View, simply open the first app on your iPad. Then, drag the icon of the second app you'd like to have beside it to the left or right corner of the screen. In addition, you may also adjust how much real estate each app will get on your iPad screen. To do this, you can simply press the middle of the screen and move the divider to the left or right.\nVoice Dictation\nEvery student has had one of those days when you only have one working brain cell left, and you're forced to sit through hours of lectures. While in the pre-technology age, people had to struggle to keep their eyes open and take notes manually, it's now possible for you to record lectures in just a few taps using your iPad's built-in dictation feature.\nTo enable dictation on your iPad, open your Settings and tap General > Keyboard. Next, under English, toggle on the button next to \"Enable Dictation.\" Then, on your Notes app, click the Microphone button on the lower-right corner of the screen to begin the transcription.\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind each professor's policy for recording their classes. In some cases, they may be discussing sensitive topics, which can be misunderstood if shared without context. With this, it's best to make sure to ask explicit permission before recording anyone.\nAside from recording your lectures, you can also record things like interviews for your thesis or when you're practicing for a big presentation. After recording, you can also opt for transcription services to easily get key texts without having to listen to entire the recording."

      "text": "The Top 5 iPad Pro Keyboards, Ranked\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nAn iPad might typically be used in its tablet form for casual scrolling, but you can attach a keyboard to it to have it act as a makeshift laptop. iPad Pros in particular have some beefy hardware in them, so it's not a bad idea to get some work done on them. There are a bunch of different routes you can take to get an iPad keyboard: options include a basic Bluetooth option, or going for something that can snap and connect right to your iPad itself.\nSplurging a bit for a good keyboard is recommended for the productive consumers who will use their iPad for work often, even if a cheap keyboard may do well in a pinch. Having something dependable and reliable is important, especially if you plan on using it as a more-permanent setup. A lot of people like to pair Apple products with Apple products for ease of use, but they aren't the only option on the market for iPad keyboards.\nApple Smart Keyboard\nLet's get things started with the Apple Smart Keyboard. Retailing at $179.99, it's far from the cheapest option. However, Apple's keyboard does a lot to justify the high price tag: It magnetically attaches to the tablet, and it just starts working immediately without having to be charged or paired. The ease of access makes it so anybody can open up this keyboard and start working in a matter of minutes.\nThe Apple Smart Keyboard works with every iPad Pro model, so there's no need to worry if your device is compatible with it like some other third-party keyboard options. Another way to justify the price tag is how the Smart Keyboard also acts as a thin case for the iPad. It's definitely not the sturdiest option out there, but it'll do a good job of keeping your tablet from being scratched up or scuffed on both the screen and the back of the iPad.\nApple Magic Keyboard\nWhile the Smart Keyboard comes away as the winner for most iPad users, it's not Apple's flagship option. The Magic Keyboard would be the option that people get if they want the best thing money can buy. Coming in at a whopping $299, it costs almost half of what a new iPad Pro costs. The Magic Keyboard comes with better build quality, and also has a built-in trackpad. These two features alone help it feel more like a high-end keyboard versus one you simply attach.\nOf course, at a cost of over $100 more than Apple's Smart Keyboard, it's going to be a tough pill to swallow for some, despite the step up in quality. If your budget allows for it, then by all means, go for the Magic Keyboard. More cost-conscious consumers, or somebody just looking for the best value, will get by just fine with the Smart Keyboard or the right third-party option.\nLogitech Combo Touch\nThe Logitech Combo Touch works a lot like the Apple options, despite being a third-party product instead. You'll still be able to snap your iPad to the keyboard, and there's no need to charge it either, as it gets juice from the tablet itself. It's $159.99, so the price is still high, but it's lower than Apple's options by a little bit. If you're okay with leaving the Apple ecosystem for a still-solid keyboard, it's tough to find a better alternative than this.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the Combo Touch isn't compatible with all iPads. It works with the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th-gen iPad models, the 3rd-gen iPad Air, and the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. You'll have to opt for a different version to find the Combo Touch that supports the 11-inch iPad Pro, and there will be a price change that brings the total to $199.99, but you're still getting a fantastic keyboard for the price.\nLogitech Keys-to-Go\nStaying within the Logitech family, the Keys-to-Go keyboard is a solid choice if you're looking to drop down further in price. The company's portable Bluetooth keyboard option will work with your iPhone, iPad, and even Apple TV, so there's a lot of versatility to the little keyboard. The biggest draw to it is the fact it will only cost you $69.99.\nThere are some downsides when compared to the more expensive designs, but that's to be expected. It won't snap to the iPad, it does have to be charged, and it doesn't come with a trackpad like the Magic Keyboard or Combo Touch. Despite having to be charged, Logitech does say a single charge lasts three months.\nIf none of the extra bells and whistles particularly matter to you, then go ahead and snag yourself the Keys-to-Go. It comes with anything you need to get started typing away on your iPad, and it even comes with a little stand you can latch to your keyboard to prop your device up.\nZAGG Pro Keys\nRounding out the list is the ZAGG Pro Keys option. This keyboard costs $109.99, making it a bit pricier than the Keys-To-Go option. However, it does come with extra features over the Logitech keyboard. For starters, it attaches to the iPad, making it a bit more comfortable to use. If you want a basic option that simply works as an attachable keyboard, this is a good choice.\nThere is a lot of flexibility you can take for some more features, though. The ZAGG Pro Keys has a design that comes with a trackpad, but that'll bump up the price significantly unless you find it on sale. You will also have to make sure you're grabbing the right model that fits your specific iPad. The 10.2-inch, 10.9-inch, 11-inch, and 12.9-inch iPad models are all supported.\nYou can also bundle with a screen protector and stylus if you want a bit more bang for your buck. Like the Keys-To-Go, ZAGG says the keyboard will survive on a three-month charge at a time. It's another solid option for those who prefer not to use Apple's offering of accessories."

      "text": "10 iPad Pro Features That Will Change How You Use Your Tablet\nEver since Gene Roddenberry's \"Star Trek\" first lit up living rooms around the world with visions of the Starship Enterprise, people have dreamed of a day when that fiction becomes reality. Who wouldn't want to live in a world with high-speed interplanetary travel, instant short-range transportation, and sleek touchscreen computing at your fingertips? So far, we haven't figured out interplanetary travel or transporters, but we did manage tablet computing.\nTablets feel so ubiquitous that it's easy to forget it's been little more than a decade since most of us got our hands on one. Apple certainly wasn't the first company to try their hand at a tablet \u2014 those efforts stretch back at least as far as the late '80s and Hindsight's prototype Letterbug computer \u2014 but Apple succeeded in energizing the market in a way no one had before. Riding the momentum of the first iPhone just three years earlier, Apple's first iPad hit shelves with a level of fanfare that made it an instant success. Today, a little more than half of all tablets purchased in the United States are iPads.\nIf you've got your hands on an iPad Pro, you're looking at a lot of cool functionality right out of the box and readily available on the surface. Then there are other features, not quite hidden but also not immediately apparent, which can take your tablet time to the next level.\nHandwriting to text conversion\nThe most apparent difference between a tablet and a conventional computer is the lack of keyboard and mouse. You can buy a peripheral mouse and keyboard to type things up, but you got a tablet because you wanted to use the touchscreen. The iPad Pro is a cut above most in this regard, thanks to its advanced touchscreen and the Apple pencil.\nWithout a keyboard, your only option for typing is to use the virtual keyboard on the touchscreen itself, which totally works but isn't ideal. Instead, you can ditch the keyboard entirely, write things by hand, and let your iPad Pro convert it into typed text for you.\nThere are two ways to convert your handwriting to typed text. If you know you're going to want to convert your handwriting in advance, select the pen with the letter \"A\" on it from your Apple pencil options. Your iPad will convert your handwriting into text in real-time, as you write. If you've only realized you need to convert some handwriting after the fact, you can do that as well. Select the handwriting you want to convert and tap Copy as Text. Then move to the Notes app or another text-based window and paste the converted text.\nPicture in Picture\nYour iPad is capable of housing just about everything you need for work time and play time. It's convenient, but it also means that every once in a while, your leisure time is interrupted by something urgent. Say you're watching a movie and a notification pops up. You see that it's an important email that needs a quick response. It won't take long, so you pause your movie and exit out of its app. Go back to your home screen, open up your email ... and so on. It's not the biggest problem in the world but it's annoying, and it's fixable.\nYour iPad's Picture in Picture feature lets you shrink a video down into a smaller window that floats over the top of whatever else you need to do. To activate it while watching a video, tap your screen and look for the shrink icon. It looks like a large white rectangle with an arrow pointing to a smaller gray rectangle.\nNow you can answer emails, pay bills, look something up, or just surf the web without ever having to pause your movie. You can also manipulate the floating window to resize it, move it to another position on your screen, or return to full screen when you're ready.\nMultitasking multiple apps\nWhile Picture in Picture lets you watch movies, TV, and YouTube videos while doing other things, your iPad Pro has even more multitasking options. There are two common ways to multitask with apps and one uncommon way, compatible only with certain apps.\nSplit View is pretty much what it sounds like. If you've ever played multiplayer \"Mario Kart,\" that's more or less what you're in for. It lets you display two disparate apps on your screen at the same time, each of them taking up one half of the screen. Slide Over is similar, but lets you move one app to a narrow floating window on the right or left while displaying another app on the main part of the screen. Split View and Slide Over are compatible with just about any application. Last and least common is Center Window, which is only compatible with some apps. It pulls one app into a floating window front and center, with your other content displayed behind.\nThe long and short is that multitasking lets you harness the power of two apps at once to get more done in less time. Next time you're composing an email and need to look something up, slide your email client to one side and open a browser on the other. To muss, no fuss.\nDrag and Drop\nOn a desktop or laptop, moving content from one application to another is pretty effortless, thanks to the combined power of the keyboard and mouse. Is there anything they can't do? Maneuvering content around on a tablet, however, isn't quite as simple or intuitive. Fortunately, your iPad Pro is capable of dragging and dropping content across apps using nothing more than your touchscreen.\nStart by opening the apps you need in Split View or Slide Over. If you're copying something from a website into a text, put one on the left and one on the right. You get the drill. Before you can Drag and Drop, your iPad needs to know what it needs to move. For images, press and hold until you see it \"lift up.\" If there's a sort of shimmer around the image, you're good to go. If you're working with text, you'll have to highlight it before you press and hold.\nOnce you're shimmering, slide your lassoed content from one app to the other and drop it in its new home. Your computer's Copy and Paste procedure is tried and true, but it doesn't look and feel like a magic trick. Sometimes change is a good thing.\nSidecar\nAn iPad Pro can make a great standalone computer, but sometimes you need the additional power and peripherals of a laptop. When that happens, you can put your iPad Pro to work as your computer's second monitor, using Apple's Sidecar feature.\nUsing Sidecar, you can either mirror your Mac's display to share with someone else or you can extend the display to give you a completely independent screen. To get started, you have to meet a few minimum requirements. Your Mac must be newer than late 2015 (check Apple's compatibility list for full details) and needs to be running macOS Catalina or later. You'll also need a compatible iPad. Fortunately, every model of the iPad Pro is compatible with Sidecar.\nNext, you need to make sure your Mac and iPad Pro can talk to each other. They must be using the same Apple ID with two-factor authentication, and they must have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Handoff turned on. With all of that taken care of, your iPad will be able to connect with your Mac wirelessly, as long as they're within 30 feet (10 meters). You can also connect them directly with a USB cable, as long as your iPad is set up to trust your Mac.\nScan and send documents\nThanks to technologies like DocuSign, signing and returning important documents is a lot more convenient than it once was. But every now and again, you might be called upon to physically sign a document and return it. The tried and true method is to print the document out, sign it in pen, then scan it and return it. It gets the job done, but it's needlessly laborious at this point in our ongoing technological revolution.\nYou've got a few options for scanning, signing, and sending documents with your iPad Pro. If you have a physical document, you could sign it with a pen and scan the signed document or you could scan it unmarred and sign the digital replica. If you've been sent a digital document, you can sign and send it back without ever involving the physical realm.\nIn the Notes app, tap the camera button, then tap the Scan Documents icon \u2014 It looks like a printed page with a dotted box around it \u2014 and point your camera at the document you want to sign. If your iPad is set to Auto mode, it will scan automatically as soon as it detects something scannable. Otherwise, hit the Shutter icon to scan. To sign, tap the Share button and select the Markup icon (looks like the tip of a pen). Write your signature with your finger or Apple Pencil and send it off. You can also save that signature and stamp it onto documents in the future.\nContinuity\nIf you've ever found yourself trying to move an image or document from your phone or tablet to another machine, you've probably lamented how frustrating it can be. Communication between devices isn't always as seamless as it could be and you might resort to inefficient workarounds like emailing something to yourself, just to get it from one place to the next.\nBy contrast, your iPad Pro works automatically with other Apple products, almost as if they're all one big machine with disparate but wirelessly connected parts. As long as your iPad and your other Apple devices (iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac) are on the same network and use the same Apple ID, the Continuity features lets you move from one to the other without any of the usual headaches.\nYou can AirDrop documents, photos, videos, and more to and from your iPad and other devices. With Continuity Camera, you can transfer images directly from your iPad to your iPhone or Mac without needing to do any legwork. That means you could scan and sign a document on your iPad, then move to your Mac to compose the email and send it off. You can even copy something on your iPhone and paste it onto your iPad using the Universal Clipboard. Get your Apple devices talking to one another, and you'll save yourself a lot of headaches down the line.\nQuick Note\nThe familiar Notes app is great for dedicated writing sessions, themed lists, and writing down all of the things you swear you'll remember but immediately forget. Sometimes, however, you're in the middle of doing something when you have an idea or learn something interesting. Rather than stop what you're doing, open an entirely separate app, and write down your thoughts, use Quick Note.\nIt does exactly what the name suggests, provides you with a place to make quick notes without interrupting whatever else you're doing. The quickest way to open Quick Note on your iPad Pro is swiping up from the bottom right corner of the screen. You can also get there by clicking the share button in any app and then tapping Add to Quick Note. You can quickly write down your thoughts, tap done, and you'll be automatically returned to what you were doing before.\nQuick Note works over the top of any app or screen on your iPad and, unlike other notetaking solutions, it reminds you of your notes at relevant times. For instance, if you copy text or a URL into a Quick Note, you'll see a reminder prompt the next time you visit that site, taking you right back to your previous notes.\nHome screen widgets\nIf you're an iPhone user, or you've had a previous iPad, you're probably already familiar with Widgets. They're an alternate way of accessing certain apps and getting information at a glance. You probably have some on your phone's Home and Lock screens, showing you the weather or your calendar.\nWith an iPad Pro, you can take full advantage of widgets, thanks to the expanded real estate, as compared to an iPhone. As long as you're running iPadOS 15 or later, Widgets will work, and you can customize them to give you the information you need when you need it. To add a Widget, press and hold a vacant space on your iPad's Home screen, then tap the + icon at the top left of the screen and select Add Widget. You'll see a list of common Widgets, but you can also search for specific apps.\nPerhaps the most useful Widget is the Smart Stack, which lets you put multiple widgets into a single space on your phone screen. It will rotate through each of the stacked Widgets throughout the day, displaying the information it thinks is most relevant. You can also swipe through them whenever you want to. Now you can fill your app library to brimming and keep all of the things you really need front and center.\n3D LiDAR scans\nBeginning in 2020, Apple's introduced a number of new features to the iPad Pro. In addition to improved cameras and onboard microphones, your device comes standard with a depth-sensing LiDAR scanner. We got into the nitty gritty of how LiDAR works, but the long and the short of it is a LiDAR instrument sends a beam of light into the environment and measures the time it takes for the light to bounce back and hit a sensor. Because the speed of light is constant, the transit time corresponds with distance. If you send out a whole lot of photons in different directions and measure their return times, you can start to build a pretty accurate 3D map of almost anything.\nThe LiDAR camera works at a distance of roughly 5 meters and provides photon-level detail almost instantly. The most immediately actionable way to use LiDAR on your iPad is through the Measure app. When the app was introduced, it used augmented reality to calibrate its environment and make estimates of objects or spaces. With LiDAR, the algorithm is replaced by direct measurements of bouncing photons, happening inside your iPad in real-time. The upshot is that you get more reliable measurements for rearranging rooms or DIY projects. But why should it stop there? Considering the rise of affordable 3D printers, nothing's stopping you from making a tiny version of your house and all of your things to play with."
