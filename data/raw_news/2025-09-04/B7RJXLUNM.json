  "content": "If you enjoy water sports, a paddleboard can take your outdoor adventures to the next level. With numerous options available, finding the right board can be challenging. That's why our CNET experts are here to help. We've tested a wide array of options to find great boards for beginner paddlers, experienced pros and those interested in fitness paddling.\n\u2022 There are more affordable stand-up paddleboards A great paddleboard should have these three qualities: stability, maneuverability and durability. On top of that, most people also look for a good return on their investment. The Breeze Aero from Bote checks a ton of boxes for what your average paddler wants in a new, quality SUP. Not to mention, it's one good-looking board. The Bote Breeze Aero provides balance, speed, durability and maneuverability all in one SUP package. Speaking of packages, you also get additional gear with the board, like a paddle, pump, repair kit, fin and travel bag. The Bote Breeze Aero backpack was my favorite of the bunch. Not only is it spacious but there's also padding in the shoulder straps, so it's comfortable to haul around on your back. And it's a lot easier to transport than a solid stand-up paddleboard, along with the other inflatable boards on this list. This SUP feels fairly light, weighing in at about 20 pounds. That said, it measures 10 feet, 8 inches long and 33 inches wide, making it feel just as stable as any solid paddleboard. I never felt like I was going to tip over, even when gliding over large wakes. One of my favorite things about this stable board -- besides its stability -- is its compatibility with Bote's inflatable seat. It instantly transforms your paddleboard into a mini makeshift kayak. If you get the kayak paddle to go along with it, you have yourself a multifunctional board that lets you enjoy kayak seats and stand-up paddling. Up to 250 pounds; company recommends upgrading board if rider within 50 pounds of capacity\n\u2022 Comes with four-point bungee to strap things down\n\u2022 Not as fast as other boards The Connelly Voyager SUP was my first stand-up paddleboard and what a great board it is. I began taking it out to the beautiful (but chilly) Lake Tahoe to learn how to paddleboard. Thanks to the excellent stability and quality of the Connelly Voyager, balance wasn't an issue when winds picked up -- a good thing with 57-degree water. The wider and longer a board is, the more stable it will be. The Connelly Voyager is 10 feet, 6 inches long and 32 inches wide. It weighs 34 pounds. It has a four-point bungee near the top to strap down a cooler, shoes or any other gear you want to bring along with you. The Connelly Voyager is also designed with a ding-resistant thermo shell and thermo shell seam reinforcement for maximum durability. Speed isn't necessarily this SUP's forte but it also doesn't offer the drag that the yoga and fishing paddleboards do. It's great for stability and tracking. Keeping a straight path with the Connelly Voyager is a breeze, and it effortlessly glides over boat wakes or small waves. It doesn't come with any extra accessories but it's sold in stores like Dick's Sporting Goods, where you can go pick out your own paddle and additional gear you may want. Because the Connelly is sold at such an affordable price compared with other solid boards, you're able to spend the extra money on accessories to beef it up. This board is an all-around great pick for any skill set, including beginners who are just dipping their feet in the sport.\n\u2022 Harder to balance than other SUPs Retrospec is a popular paddleboard brand you might've seen advertised in your Instagram or Facebook feed. The Weekender model is its entry-level board and I was really impressed with how nice the board is for the price. Hands down, this is one of the best paddleboards you can get for your money. The Retrospec Weekender 10' paddleboard is 10 feet long and 30 inches wide. It has a single-layer PVC design with drop stitch tech. It comes with all the additional accessories you'll need, including a hand pump, three detachable fins, an ankle leash, a paddle, a backpack, a repair kit and even a waterproof phone case you can hang around your neck. I also love the different colors the Weekender 10' is available in. I think it offers the most versatility in style compared with the other boards. That waterproof case was a game-changer when taking photos and it didn't come with any of the other paddleboards I tested. It may be a small addition, but it's a testament to the great value you get with the Weekender 10'. The board is just 17 pounds and its lightweight construction makes for easy carrying. On the water, it glides with ease and is great for speed. You can gain good momentum with this board. That said, it was a little harder to balance than other SUPs. After 10 to 15 minutes on the board, you find your footing and get the hang of it -- even if you're a beginner. I think it's a great, all-around paddleboard with an incredibly wallet-friendly price tag.\n\u2022 Designed to keep water out The ultimate functional-paddleboard award goes to the Bote Rackham Aero 11' and it's also the best paddleboard for fishing. It's one of the most decked-out paddleboards I've ever seen and it's compatible with add-on fishing accessories to upgrade your setup. There are two inflation nozzles on the Rackham Aero: one in the front for the nose and sides and one in the back for the base. It's almost like a paddleboard and kayak hybrid, because the edges are raised, enclosing you in a little boatlike SUP. This design also helps prevent water from collecting on the top, keeping your belongings safe and dry. That's just the start of what the Rackham Aero can do. The board is designed with add-ons like the cooler tie-down points, several D-rings, accessory mounts and even a magnetic cup holder (compatible with Bote Magnepod accessories). It also includes a sheath for both your paddle and a sand spear for easy storage while you fish. I should also mention it's the only paddleboard with rear and front bungee straps, allowing you to secure your items at both points. It has everything a paddling fisher might need to enjoy time on the water. Staying stable while you fish won't be a problem on the Rackham Aero, even if you're trying to hook a big catch. Its recessed base and 36-inch width help keep you perfectly balanced. You shouldn't expect to win any SUP races on the Rackham Aero -- it's not very fast, especially when you have all your gear strapped on. The board weighs 36 pounds and the case is about 50 pounds with the board and all the accessories packed in. It's definitely heavy, but the bag has small wheels attached to the bottom like a suitcase, allowing you to easily roll it during transport.\n\u2022 Larger board is a plus for some, but may not be for all Yogis who want to take their craft to the water may be interested in a paddleboard specifically designed for yoga. As peaceful as yoga can be, there's something about the water that makes it even more centering. The secret to a nice yoga paddleboard is a wide and long base to balance on. My personal favorite is the Dhyana paddleboard from Aqua Marina. Balance is made easy with its 11-foot-by-36-inch dimensions. It's the most stable SUP I tested, next to the fishing paddleboard. Unless I was practicing a difficult yoga move I hadn't done before, I felt like I was never going to fall off that thing. Although it's such a big board, I was pleasantly surprised by its lighter, 22-pound weight. Compare that with the Bote Rackham, which is the same dimensions but 14 pounds heavier. The Aqua Marina Dhyana is made with PVC, drop stitch technology and a nonslip crocodile-grooved foot pad that covers almost the whole board so you can use a ton of space. The foot pad is softer than the padding on traditional paddleboards, making your different yoga poses feel more comfortable. Not only that, but the crocodile grooving also allows you to maintain better traction. As you can imagine, it gets pretty slippery out there on the water. Also, there isn't a handle protruding from the middle of the board, allowing you to sit or lie comfortably when you're in ground poses. Besides your standard inflatable paddleboard accessories like a pump, leash, backpack, fin and paddle, you'll also receive a yoga board strap to carry your board like a yoga mat, a paddle holder to use while you do yoga and a connection strap you can use to hook your paddleboard to other objects.\n\niRocker 10' All Around Ultra (Update: Currently unavailable)\n\u2022 Model of board is good for specific heights only The iRocker brand is fairly popular among riders and for good reason: It offers a range of models and quality boards at affordable prices. I tested the 10' All Around Ultra SUP and found it to be a great travel-friendly, lightweight board to take with you. Measuring 10 feet long and 32 inches wide and weighing 19.8 pounds, this inflatable SUP easily folds down to fit into a backpack that's more compact and preferably sized than others I've tested. It's also a lot more carry-on friendly for travel. Rather than a tall and skinny SUP backpack, the iRocker bag is more square and sits more comfortably on my back. I'm a shorter rider and tend to feel like I'm going to fall over when I carry a heavy, tall SUP backpack. In the water, the iRocker All-Around Ultra board is easy to maneuver and smoothly coasts along at a quick speed without much effort. I'm also a big fan of the paddle. It's made with carbon fiber and ergonomically designed to let you get good pushes in the water. It's also the only five-piece paddle I've tested, making it more compact and easy to pack. The board has a woven, drop-stitch construction and features bungee cords in the front and rear, allowing you to secure all your gear. There are even four D-rings along the sides of the board so you can strap down a seat or cooler. For the bottom of the board's base, there are two long fins for easy tracking that connect to tethered flip locks. It's a fin-lock system I've never seen before and it makes it easier to secure your fins to the board. Last but certainly not least it comes with a chargeable electric pump that makes inflating your SUP way easier. After a taxing hike to the lake, an electric pump is a huge help. Even if you're going right outside your house, an electric pump comes in really handy. Pro tip: The 10' board is best for people 5 feet, 5 inches tall and under, so taller riders should choose the 11-foot model.\n\u2022 Fin may be complicated to attach My first impression of the Pioneer 2.0 was that it's equally as speedy as it is easy to balance on. After being used to my own board for so long, it took me a few minutes to find my footing and get comfortable with a few models during my testing process. I immediately clicked with Isle's Pioneer 2.0 paddleboard, as if I'd been riding it for years. It offers a fun, sturdy ride for all skill levels and is especially great for beginners. The Pioneer 2.0 has a double-layer drop-stitch construction and measures 10 feet, 6 inches long by 34 inches wide. It's a little heavier than the smaller models on this list, at 24 pounds. It has front and rear bungee cords, allowing you to store coolers, shoes, a jacket or other belongings you want to take paddling with you. I found that the nose of the Pioneer 2.0 does a great job of staying up out of the water. I kept my phone and shoes strapped under the front bungee and they stayed nice and dry. There are also two small straps attached to the side so you can secure your paddle when you're taking a break on the water, which I greatly appreciate. One of my favorite things about the Pioneer, besides its smooth ride, is the padding material. Other boards I've tested are made with extra-grippy, textured traction pads that without a doubt help with traction. The traction pad on the Pioneer 2.0 is made with a soft material that offers great traction and is more comfortable -- especially when you're on your knees (a big plus for beginners). The Pioneer 2.0 comes with a carbon hybrid paddle, hand pump, storage/travel bag, fin and leash. The travel bag comes with straps on the inside to secure your board, a nice touch I don't see very often. The fin is a little more complicated to put on than other boards but that's hardly a con, just something worth mentioning. The Pioneer 2.0 is out of stock, but the ISLE Pioneer 3 is available, with a folding fin box, full-length deck pad and Airtech construction that shaves five pounds off its weight.\n\nIs a longer or shorter paddleboard better? That depends on what you want to use it for. Shorter boards are slower but easier to maneuver and carry around. Longer boards tend to be faster but weigh more than shorter boards. Boards less than 10 feet long are best for kids or people who want to surf. Which paddleboards are the most stable? The wider your paddleboard, the more stability it's going to provide. If balance and stability are your main concerns, keep an eye out for an SUP that's 33 inches wide or larger. Keep in mind that a wider board will feel slower compared with a longer, narrower board. How long will an inflatable paddleboard last? If properly stored and taken care of, your inflatable paddleboard can last five to 10 years. Most inflatable boards also come with a repair kit for punctures. Several companies also offer a two- to three-year warranty on their boards.",
