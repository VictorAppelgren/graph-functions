      "summary": "India announced a GST consumption tax cut effective September 22 to boost domestic demand amid U.S. tariffs, which is expected to lift consumer spending and support equity gains, especially in staples and auto sectors. Market participants view a short‑term positive impact on Indian stocks, with potential upside for consumer‑driven firms, but remain cautious about bond yield pressure and long‑term fiscal sustainability. The policy is part of a broader strategy to counter U.S. tariff shocks and stimulate growth, with catalysts tied to the tariff timeline and fiscal roll‑out.",
