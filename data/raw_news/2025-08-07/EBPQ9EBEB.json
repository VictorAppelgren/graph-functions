      "text": "In This Article:\nSimon Property Group, the nation\u2019s largest developer with an eclectic portfolio ranging from outlet and entertainment to luxury centers, has added an upscale asset by acquiring the retail and parking components at Brickell City Centre in Miami.\nSimon bought the assets from Swire Properties, a developer of mixed-use, commercial and residential properties in Miami.\nMore from WWD\n-\nMall Giant David Simon Says Leasing Demand 'Is Still Strong'\n-\nForever 21 U.S. Operator Readies Bankruptcy Filing, Preps New Operating Strategy\nPrior to the acquisition, Simon owned a 25 percent, non-managing interest in the retail at Brickell City Centre. With this latest transaction, the real estate investment trust will wholly own and manage the asset. In its announcement Friday, Simon did not disclose the cost of the acquisition.\nBrickell City Centre is a 5-million-square-foot mixed-use property including a 500,000-square-foot open-air shopping center. Completed in 2016 and located in the heart of the Brickell district of downtown Miami, the four-level shopping center houses 90 retailers, among them Saks Fifth Avenue, Apple, Chanel Fragrance & Beauty Boutique, Coach, Kirk Jewelers, Lululemon, Sephora, Zara, Richard Mille, Sandro and Nike. The center also houses more than 15 \u201cpremium\u201d dining and entertainment locations, including Motek, Tacology, The Henry, PuttShack, and a \u201cluxury VIP\u201d cinema from CMX.\nAmong Brickell\u2019s more sophisticated architectural features is its $30 million, three-block long, elevated glass and steel trellis called the Climate Ribbon, which protects visitors from sun and rain. It cools the environment and collects rain water that gets recycled for irrigation and other uses. Due to the construction, the light in the center changes constantly as the day progresses and the position of the sun, in relation to Earth, shifts.\nAnother unique element is the Metromover station right at Brickell City Centre. Metromover is a free train service that operates seven days a week in the downtown Miami and Brickell area, taking people to the FTX Arena, where the Miami Heat basketball team plays, Bayside Marketplace and Miami Dade College. The Metro Rail line also stops two blocks away.\nThe acquisition bolsters Simon\u2019s already strong presence in the Miami area. The real estate giant wholly owns or has stakes in the Dadeland Mall, Miami International Mall and the Dolphin Mall.\nThe Miami-based Swire Properties Inc. is best known for its $1 billion, master-planned development of Brickell City Centre and the island of Brickell Key in downtown Miami. The company is the U.S. real estate arm of Swire Properties Limited, which develops and manages commercial, retail, hotels and residential properties globally. Swire Properties\u2019 ultimate holding company is the U.K.-based John Swire & Sons Limited, an international conglomerate with a diversified portfolio of businesses founded in Liverpool over 200 years ago."

      "text": "The world is full of uncertainties, yet business remains \u201crobust\u201d and the demand for retail space stays \u201cunabated\u201d at the Simon Property Group.\nThat assessment came from David Simon, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group, which on Monday reported second-quarter gains across the board and exceeded expectations.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $556.1 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, compared to $493.5 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in 2024. Industry analysts expected $1.55 a share.\nReal estate funds from operations were $1.15 billion, or $3.05 per diluted share, as compared to $1.1 billion, or $2.93 per diluted share, in the prior year, an increase of 4.1 percent. Occupancy as of June 30 was 96 percent, a 0.4 percent gain compared to 95.6 percent on June 30, 2024.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of geopolitical stuff going on, obviously, and a lot of domestic political stuff going on. Tariffs swing back and forth. There\u2019s interest rate uncertainty. You name it. However, you have unbelievable stores that are able to manage that, and retail demand is really unabated,\u201d Simon said during Monday\u2019s conference call with investors and industry analysts. \u201cThe physical shopping environment continues to be the place to be.\u2026So we\u2019re quite bullish about what we\u2019ve done, what we are doing, and where we are going, despite all the headlines that are out there.\u201d\nIn other good news for investors, Simon\u2019s board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $2.15 for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of $0.10, or 4.9 percent year-over-year. The dividend will be payable Sept. 30 to shareholders of record on Sept. 9, 2025.\nThe company is slightly upping its outlook for real estate FFO, to $12.45 to $12.65 a diluted share for 2025 from the previous forecast of $12.40 to $12.65 a diluted share.\nDuring the call, Simon said he \u201ckind of chuckles\u201d when he reads about companies restructuring, saying they\u2019re going to lease their properties better, manage their balance sheets better, bring in new management. \u201cYou\u2019ve never read about a Simon Property Group restructuring. Yes, we had to do certain drastic things to deal with COVID and to deal with the great financial crisis [of 2008-2009], but there\u2019s been no restructuring in this company \u2014 only things that have benefited shareholders.\n\u201cThis company doesn\u2019t need to sell a bunch of assets, doesn\u2019t need to bring in a new management team, it doesn\u2019t need to downsize its platform. It doesn\u2019t need to do it because it\u2019s outperformed over a 30-plus-year period that no one else has done.\u201d\nOn June 27, the company acquired its partners\u2019 interest in the retail and parking facilities at Brickell City Centre in Miami. Simon now wholly owns and manages the asset. \u201cA couple of more things will get announced this year, and they\u2019ll be accretive,\u201d Simon said, without specifying. \u201cThey will add to our platform and we\u2019ll be able to manage them better so we\u2019ll be able to grow our cash flow.\u201d\nAsked by one analyst how \u201cmom and pop\u201d stores are performing amid all the macro uncertainties and the tariff situation, Simon said, \u201cLast quarter, I did express my concern about that segment given how tariffs might affect them and their cost of goods. But they\u2019re beating their plans so far this year. So it\u2019s all systems go there. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s trepidation, but I think they\u2019re managing as best they can. The full story, obviously, given the volatility has not been written.\u201d\nAnother analyst suggested the possibility of an impending wave of major mall transactions. But Simon said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure about whether there\u2019s going to be the huge mall transactions. I think you\u2019ll have other players come in buying maybe not necessarily \u2018A\u2019 properties, but a lot of \u2018Bs\u2019 because the reality is you can create a nice arbitrage and manage them or lease them and improve them. They are a lot stickier than people believe\u2026despite the media and the naysayers \u2014 and that\u2019s not to say there hasn\u2019t been a significant amount of obsolescence \u2014 most of them are here today, still fighting a pretty good battle.\u201d\nSimon summed up the second-quarter performance, stating: \u201cWe delivered robust financial and operational results yet again for the second quarter. Occupancy gains, increased shopper traffic and higher retail sales volumes contributed to strong cash flow growth. We continue to enhance our real estate platforms through development, redevelopment and acquisitions, including the purchase of our partners\u2019 interest in Brickell City Centre, a premier mixed-use property in Miami and its rapidly growing central business district.\u201d\nIn other second-quarter statistics, Simon reported that base minimum rent per square foot was $58.70 as of June 30, compared to $57.94 as of June 30, 2024, an increase of 1.3 percent. Also, reported retailer sales per square foot were $736 for the trailing 12 months ended June 30. Reported retailer sales per square foot were $741 for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024. While Simon reported traffic being up 1.5 percent, the slight drop in sales per square foot was attributed to assets that are on the northern and southern borders of the nation."

      "text": "In This Article:\nDespite waning consumer confidence, trade wars and economic uncertainties, Simon Property Group, the nation\u2019s largest operator and owner of shopping centers, came out looking good last quarter.\nFunds from operations, a standard financial yardstick at real estate companies, reached $1.1 billion, or $2.95 per diluted share, for the first quarter, compared with $1.09 billion, or $2.91 per diluted share in the prior year.\nMore from WWD\n-\nForever 21 U.S. Operator Readies Bankruptcy Filing, Preps New Operating Strategy\n-\nSimon Teams With Shopify and Leap to Bring Brands to Its Centers\nDomestic property net operating income (NOI) for the three months ended March 31 increased 3.4 percent and portfolio NOI increased 3.6 percent compared to the prior year period.\nOccupancy as of March 31 was 95.9 percent, up from 95.5 percent a year earlier. Base minimum rent per square foot stood at $58.92, a year-over-year increase of 2.4 percent.\nReported retailer sales per square foot was $733 for the 12 months ended March 31, versus $745 a year earlier. The decline was attributed to a shift in Easter timing, weather conditions impacting traffic, West Coast fires, and less tourism, particularly from Canadian and Mexican shoppers. Tourism to the U.S. has declined due, in part, to economic concerns and the strength of the dollar against other currencies.\nSimon reaffirmed its outlook for real estate FFO of $12.40 to $12.65 per diluted share for 2025.\nOn Jan. 30, the company completed the acquisition of two luxury outlets in Italy \u2014 The Mall Firenze in Leccio, near Florence, and The Mall Sanremo, on the Italian Riviera.\nLast March, Simon\u2019s 50-percent-owned Jakarta Premium Outlets in Tangerang, Indonesia, opened with 302,000 square feet featuring global and local brands and international dining.\n\u201cOur first-quarter results underscore the strength of our business,\u201d David Simon, chairman, chief executive officer and president, said in a statement. \u201cWe delivered strong financial and operational performance and enhanced our portfolio with the acquisition of The Mall Luxury Outlets in Italy and the successful opening of Jakarta Premium Outlets in Indonesia. As macroeconomic conditions continue to shift, we are well-positioned with a fortress balance sheet and a proven track record of navigating successfully through a wide range of economic cycles.\u201d\nSimon\u2019s board also declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $2.10 for the second quarter. This is an increase of 10 cents, or 5 percent year-over-year."
