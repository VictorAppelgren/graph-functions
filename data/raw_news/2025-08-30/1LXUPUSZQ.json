  "title": "Trump administration to deny and revoke Palestinian leadership visas",
  "description": "The Trump administration announced it would be sanctioning PA officials.",
  "content": "The Trump administration on Friday announced that it would sanction Palestinian Authority leaders until they change course on the promotion of terrorism.\n\nState Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott accused the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization of promoting terrorism, \u201cundermining the prospects for peace,\u201d and engaging in \u201clawfare.\u201d In response, he said the State Department would be denying and revoking the visas of PA and PLO leadership members, though he didn\u2019t specify who exactly.\n\n\u201cBefore the PLO and PA can be considered partners for peace, they must consistently repudiate terrorism, including the October 7 massacre, and end incitement to terrorism in education, as required by U.S. law and as promised by the PLO,\u201d Pigott said.\n\n\u201cThe PA must also end its attempts to bypass negotiations through international lawfare campaigns, including appeals to the ICC and ICJ, and efforts to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state. Both steps materially contributed to Hamas\u2019s refusal to release its hostages, and to the breakdown of the Gaza ceasefire talks,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Pigott said the United States would waive the sanctions for the PA Mission to the United Nations.\n\nFor the sanctions to be revoked, the PA/PLO must \u201cmeet their obligations and demonstrably take concrete steps to return to a constructive path of compromise and peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe State Department undertook a similar maneuver in July, blocking the issuance of new visas for unspecified PA/PLO officials.\n\nRUBIO ROLLS OUT VISA BAN FOR PALESTINIAN GROUP TWO DAYS AFTER UK PROPOSED GIVING ORGANIZATION AUTHORITY\n\nThe PA is largely reliant on U.S. support and funding, with the ruling PLO internationally viewed as a more moderate, pliable Palestinian alternative to the Islamists of Hamas. The PA, which rules the West Bank, cooperates with the Israeli government to root out Hamas militants and other terrorists within its territory. Israel\u2019s aggressive tactics in the West Bank since Oct. 7, 2023, have strained relations between the two.\n\nThe PA\u2019s relationship with the U.S. has been further strained with President Donald Trump taking office. The administration\u2019s stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict often puts it at odds with the PA, which it views as only slightly less radical than Hamas and unwilling to cooperate with Israel.",

      "text": "The State Department on Thursday announced it is imposing sanctions that deny visas to the two interrelated Palestinian entities that have historically governed Gaza and other disputed territories in the region.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s move to block visas from being granted to members of the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization appears to mark a rebuke to two key allies of the United States, France and Great Britain, which, in recent days, rolled out plans to recognize a Palestinian state that would likely hand the PA and PLO greater control over the region.\nThe State Department justified the sanctions by arguing that the PA and PLO, both controlled by Mahmoud Abbas, violated two U.S. laws seeking to hold the organizations accountable for commitments to renounce terrorism. The PA and PLO violated the commitments by taking actions to internationalize their conflict with Israel, such as through the International Criminal Court, supporting terrorists through the \u201cincitement and glorification of violence\u201d in textbooks, and providing payments and benefits in support of terrorism to Palestinian terrorists and their families, the State Department said.\nOne of the laws, the Middle East Peace Commitments Act of 2002, allows the government to impose visa bans on PLO and PA officials for violations of those commitments to renounce terrorism.\nThe State Department\u2019s move to sanction the PA and PLO comes just two days after U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced tentative plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September at the U.N. General Assembly. It comes exactly one week after French President Emmanuel Macron made a strong commitment to do the same.\nWhile the two countries have expressed different degrees of confidence in Abbas\u2019s commitment to renouncing terrorism, moves by either of them to recognize a Palestinian state are viewed as the avenue to placing the PLO and PA leader in a greater position of power in Gaza, even though neither Macron nor Starmer directly names him as head of the state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to say the British government doesn\u2019t recognise governments, it recognises states,\u201d Sir Vincent Fean, a former British consul general to Jerusalem, told the Independent. \u201cSo it isn\u2019t actually recognising President [Mahmoud] Abbas as head of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organisation] and head of the Palestinian Authority.\nAbbas is chairman of the PLO and president of the PA. The PLO has played a broader role in the international representation of Palestinians. The PA has more directly governed disputed areas such as the West Bank and Gaza for years until Hamas took control. The PLO and PA have traditionally been viewed as the lesser of two evils when compared to Hamas, committing to renouncing terrorism and providing a measure of stability in the region. Still, it has historically drawn intense criticism, particularly from the U.S., for committing and condoning terrorist acts against Israel, despite pledges to avoid violence.\nHowever, amid the turmoil in Gaza, now controlled by Hamas, U.S. allies have increasingly moved to break with the Trump administration\u2019s unwillingness to cede control to an Abbas-aligned government. While neither France nor the U.K.\u2019s plans to recognize a Palestinian state directly hand the reins to the PLO and PA, Abbas is viewed as the de facto leader of any alternative government to Hamas. And both Macron and Starmer have spoken with him as they prepare to declare formal support for a Palestinian state in September at the U.N. General Assembly.\nWhen it announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state on July 24, France in particular expressed confidence in Abbas\u2019s commitment to renounce violence. The country\u2019s Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs lauded the \u201ccourageous commitments taken by the Palestinian Authority, which has come out strongly in favor of the two-State solution and peace\u201d as France pledged to choose \u201cthe Palestinian actors who have chosen dialogue and peace over those such as Hamas.\u201d\n\u201cIn light of the commitments that the President of the Palestinian Authority made to me, I therefore wrote to him expressing my determination to move forward,\u201d Macron wrote in a post to X that earned him praise from PA Vice President Hussein Al Sheikh, who thanked the French president for his letter to Abbas informing him of the statehood decision.\nStarmer spoke directly with Abbas before going public with his tentative decision to back a Palestinian state this fall, according to the Wafa news agency, which reported Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa also discussed the move with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. The British prime minister\u2019s formal announcement on Tuesday announcing the decision provoked praise from the PA, which called Starmer\u2019s statement \u201ca corrective to over a century of dispossession, during which the Palestinian people have been deprived of our land, liberty and lives.\u201d\nWhile Rubio\u2019s State Department has signaled strong displeasure with Starmer and Macron for their stance on a Palestinian state, particularly through its latest action against the PLO and PA\u2019s visas on Thursday, Trump has appeared to take a more laissez-faire approach to the matter. Although he condemned attempts to put pressure on Israel as \u201crewarding Hamas\u201d during an appearance in Scotland this week alongside Starmer, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind him taking a position\u201d when asked what he thought about Starmer recognizing a Palestinian state.\n\u201cThat\u2019s [Macron\u2019s] opinion. He can have an opinion,\u201d Trump later said. \u201cI guess Starmer is doing the same thing as Macron, and that\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t mean I have to agree.\u201d\nSome analysts have warned that should the UN approve a Palestinian state as a full member, the move \u201cwould immediately trigger U.S. funding cuts to the international organization\u201d due to its \u201cinexorable links\u201d to the PLO and PA.\n\u201cThe Foreign Relations Authorization Act FY 1990 and 1991 section 414 created a prohibition on U.S. funding to the United Nations in the event the PLO is recognized as a member state party. The PLO and Palestinian Authority (PA) remain inexorably linked, and so a declaration of statehood and member status would force a U.S. funding halt,\u201d Tyler Stapleton, the director of government relations for Foundation of Defense for Democracies, a Washington, D.C., based right-leaning think tank, said.\nUnlike Starmer and Macron\u2019s approach to ending the crisis in Gaza by proposing a Palestinian state, Trump has suggested the conflict could be resolved if Hamas releases the remaining hostages it abducted during the terrorist organization\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\nAmid the divergence of views with allies, Starmer has appeared to go to greater lengths than Macron to keep the relationship between his country and the U.S. strong.\nWhile Macron unequivocally promised to recognize a Palestinian state in the coming months, Starmer held out hope for a ceasefire before September and said that the PA and PLO must commit to \u201cmuch needed reform\u201d before his final decision, which would assess in September \u201chow far the parties have met these steps.\u201d\n\u201cStarmer has been careful to maintain a cordial relationship with Trump, which he sees as something that benefits the U.K., Europe, and the precarious alliance of democracies worldwide,\u201d University of Glasgow politics lecturer Michael Frazer, previously told the Washington Examiner. \u201cThe U.S.-U.K. trade deal and continued support for Ukraine seem to suggest that this friendly approach is paying off, as unpopular as it may be in the U.K. generally and in Scotland in particular.\u201d\nMACRON ANNOUNCES FRANCE WILL RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATE AT UN\nGiven the circumstances, careful rhetoric from Starmer is unlikely to rectify the increasingly uncertain situation the U.S. faces as it chooses whether to join a growing number of key allies in backing Palestinian statehood or stay in Israel\u2019s corner as it vows to stand against Hamas.\n\u201cEstablishing a Palestinian state today is establishing a Hamas state, a jihadist state,\u201d Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar declared Monday. \u201cIt ain\u2019t gonna happen,\u201d he added."

The move follows a similar July ban and comes amid UK and France plans to recognize a Palestinian state, which the U.S. views as undermining its policy. The sanctions require the PA/PLO to renounce terrorism and cease lawfare to lift the ban, under the Middle East Peace Commitments Act. The decision reflects tension between U.S. allies and the administration\u2019s hardline stance on the Israel\u2011Palestine conflict.",
