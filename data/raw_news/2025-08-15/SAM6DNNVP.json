As I've said to you before, he wasn't a good enough leader, because a better leader helps the country turn the page. You know, we rarely go backwards as a country. So, how bad of a presidency do you have to encourage the country to go backwards?\" Todd asked.\n\nHe went on to argue \"the perception of the Biden presidency was that it's just a weak and ineffective presidency. It\u2019s possible some of the things he signed into law will have long-term success, but the fact of the matter is his legacy is Donald Trump came back, and that's on Joe Biden.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Biden for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump\u2019s return to the presidency after losing in 2020 is historically rare, with the only other president to do so in the United States' nearly 250-year history being Grover Cleveland.",

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "Weeks after former President Joe Biden went head-to-head against now-President Donald Trump, Biden announced exactly a year ago, July 21, 2024, that he would bow out of the race \u2014 an unprecedented decision that led to a series of 2024 election plot twists.\nBiden\u2019s announcement came amid increasing pressure from his own party to step aside following his debate performance against Trump June 27, 2024, in Atlanta, where Biden struggled to answer seemingly basic questions.\nBiden\u2019s last-minute decision to exit the race rendered costly consequences for his party and his legacy \u2014 at least in the near future, according to experts.\nBIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP\n\"The way Biden handled his infirmity and his reluctant exit from the race will be devastating for his legacy,\" Tevi Troy, presidential historian and the former deputy secretary of Health and Human Services under George W. Bush, said in an email to Fox News Digital Thursday. \"While Biden was once known as the person who slayed the dragon that Democrats see as Trump, he will now forevermore be known as the person who allowed the dragon to return.\"\nEven after his rough debate performance, Biden dug his heels in and refused to immediately hand over the baton to another candidate. Initially, Biden, along with his White House and his campaign, said that ending his run for reelection was off the table, and that he wanted to face Trump in November 2024.\nBut after calls from Democrat leaders, including former Sen. Jon Tester of Montana and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Biden finally issued a statement claiming that he believed \"it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\nBIDEN'S STUNNING EXIT, ONE YEAR LATER: THE DROPOUT HEARD AROUND THE COUNTRY\nAs a result, Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to take his place in the race.\n\"I think it\u2019s very difficult to separate the fact that he bowed out from the fact that he did so belatedly and only after his disastrous debate performance,\" Alex Keyssar, a history professor at Harvard Kennedy School of public policy, said in an email to Fox News Digital. \"That is true now and will also be true for his legacy for quite a while.\n\"He is seen as someone who made an enormous mistake \u2014 remaining as a candidate when he could have withdrawn six months earlier \u2014 and a mistake that may well have cost his party the presidential election,\" Keyssar said.\nFew presidents have chosen not to run for reelection, and even fewer have chosen to do so in the middle of a presidential campaign. The departure from the race marked the first time a presidential candidate had done so in nearly 60 years.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThose who\u2019ve called off their presidential bids in the middle of the campaign season include former presidents Harry S. Truman, who bowed out amid low polling, and Lyndon B. Johnson, who announced he wouldn\u2019t run again amid tensions stemming from the Vietnam War and fractures within his own party.\nEven so, they each withdrew from the race months ahead of Biden.\n\"Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson both pulled out of reelection efforts in late March,\" Troy said. \"Joe Biden did it in late July, throwing the Democratic Party into turmoil.\"\n\"While incumbents generally have the advantage in running for reelection, the history of incumbent parties after the incumbent chooses to drop out late is not great: Truman\u2019s, Johnson\u2019s and Biden\u2019s party lost in each of the elections in question,\" Troy said.\nSince Biden pulled out of the race, multiple books have been written detailing Biden\u2019s final days in office, his deteriorating mental faculties, and challenges within the Democratic Party as a result of his decision to withdraw from the election.\nAdditionally, multiple investigations are ongoing on Capitol Hill concerning Biden\u2019s mental decline. For example, the House Oversight Committee is examining the cover-up of Biden\u2019s cognitive decline and potentially unauthorized executive actions taken during his presidency.\nBiden\u2019s presidential approval rating reached a high of 57% from January 2021 to April 2021 after he first took office, but dropped to a low of 36% in July 2024, according to Gallup.\nEven so, Keyssar predicted that time would soften public opinion toward Biden\u2019s presidency.\n\"As an historian, looking further into the future, I can imagine that his legacy will become more positive, as historians and other analysts focus more on his achievements in office and his basic decency as a person,\" Keyssar said."

      "text": "From political pariah to the presidency.\nFour years after Americans booted then-President Trump from the White House and he left Washington in political disgrace two months later, after trying to overturn his election loss, they are sending him back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\"It\u2019s a political victory that our country has never seen before,\" Trump said in his celebration speech early Wednesday morning, as he pointed to his convincing electoral and popular vote victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.\nAnd his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, called Trump's victory \"the greatest political comeback in American history.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION UPDATES\nTrump, in his victory address, touted that his political movement was one that \"nobody's ever seen before\u2026 this was the greatest political movement of all time.\"\nFor an undisciplined candidate known for his hyperbole, Tuesday's election results appeared to prove Trump right.\n\"This is a historic political realignment,\" seasoned Republican strategist Ryan Williams said.\nHOW TRUMP WON: THE DETAILS FROM THE FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS\nWilliams argued that Trump \"basically threw out the coalition that Republicans had put together for the last several decades and reached out and doubled down on voting blocks that he thought he could make a connection with.\"\n\"He just expanded the party in a way that no other nominee has been able to do before. And I think that\u2019s why the polling missed this, because he so radically changed the composition of the electorate,\" Williams highlighted.\nPreliminary data from the Fox News Voter Analysis of the 2024 election spotlighted that Trump ran up the score with his base while narrowing traditional Democratic advantages among Black, Hispanic, and young voters.\nHarris came close in her bid to become the first woman elected to the presidency but was unable to make enough gains in the ideological middle of the electorate to offset defections among groups that traditionally vote Democratic.\nThe Fox News Voter Analysis is a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide which highlights the 2024 campaign\u2019s key dynamics.\nFor Trump, the 2024 campaign was a grueling two-year marathon. He announced his candidacy at his south Florida Mar-a-Lago club days after the 2022 midterm elections.\nAnd he launched his campaign amid criticism from many in his party that he was partially responsible for the GOP's lackluster performance in the midterm elections.\nBut after a slow start, the former president eventually easily dispatched a field of GOP primary opponents \u2013 which last year briefly expanded to over a dozen contenders \u2013 as he ran the table earlier this year in the Republican presidential primaries.\nTrump, who was indicted in four different criminal cases, saw his support surge and his fundraising soar in the late spring of this year, after he made history as the first former or current president convicted of felonies.\nA month later, President Biden suffered a major setback after a disastrous late June debate performance against Trump reignited longstanding questions over whether the 81-year-old president was physically and mentally up for another four grueling years in the White House \u2013 and sparked calls from within his own party for him to step down.\nTrump's polling advantage over Biden widened, and the former president was further politically boosted after surviving an assassination attempt on his life at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, two days before the start of the Republican National Convention in July.\nBut the race was instantly turned upside down days later, as Biden ended his re-election bid and endorsed his vice president. Democrats quickly coalesced around Harris, and her fundraising surged as her poll numbers soared.\nThe Harris honeymoon continued through the late August Democratic National Convention, and into September, when most pundits declared her the winner of the one and only presidential debate between her and Trump.\nBut as the calendar moved from September into October, Trump appeared to regain his footing, and public opinion surveys indicated the former president gaining momentum.\nLongtime GOP strategist David Kochel noted that we're \"still in a country where you have a 70% wrong track. The voters wanted to change who was in the White House.\"\nKochel, a veteran of numerous Republican presidential campaigns, noted that while Harris \"breathed some life into the campaign, some enthusiasm, the fundamentals didn\u2019t change. People are unhappy with the economy. They think the country\u2019s going in the wrong direction. And they wanted to make a change. And it turns out Trump won the change argument.\"\nThe Fox News Voter Analysis also spotlighted that in an election where voters across the country wanted change, they chose Trump\u2019s outsider appeal over Kamala Harris\u2019 promise to \"turn the page\" on the Trump era.\nkochel also noted that Trump's team \"ran a very effective swing state campaign with effective advertising that hurt her [Harris.].\"\nWilliams also applauded the Trump campaign, saying that they \"had a strategy and stuck with it. They just basically said we\u2019re going with men\u2026 they doubled down on men.. they had a consistent strategy for it, and it worked.\"\nAnd Williams argued that Harris \"basically took the Hillary Clinton playbook from 2016, xeroxed it, and made it worse.\"\nAnd both strategists highlighted that Trump was able to overcome his many misstatements and controversial comments.\n\"We pay so much attention to the crazy things Trump says. All that stuff that people find inappropriate. That stuff doesn\u2019t matter,\" Kochel argued. \"He had a better strategy and an environment that played to his favor.\"\nAnd Williams spotlighted that Trump \"has a way of understanding the electorate and connecting with people in a way that no other politician does. He just speaks off the cuff in his own way, and despite the fact that he tells a lot of mistruths, he\u2019s viewed as being genuine because he\u2019s not a polished politician.\"\nFox News' Dana Blanton and Victoria Balara contributed to this report"

I sit here, I look at this, and I think, were we sold a 40-year bill of goods?\" Todd said.\n\"So for me, the original sin was running in the first place. Because his family was in crisis. I followed that Hunter Biden trial soup to nuts,\" Todd told Tapper. \"I read every single transcript. I read all of the testimony. I cannot believe to this day, Jake, that Joe Biden did this to his kids. I just can\u2019t believe that he did it. I can\u2019t.\"\nThe CNN host said a person close to the Biden family had told him there were a lot of \"truths the family did not want to face up to.\"\n\"One, Beau was dying, two. Hunter is addicted to drugs. Three, Joe Biden cares about his family more than anything else, and those three are not true, this person close to the family said. And when you talk about his running in 2020, I think that comes to bear, because, obviously, he was putting his ambition, and if you want to be charitable, his hopes to save the country from Trumpism, or whatever, obviously he was putting that above what was going on with his family and his two children and their struggles,\" Tapper said earlier in the discussion.\nTodd criticized the notion that Biden is a family man in March and has argued that he shouldn't have run for president at all.\nIRRITATED CHUCK TODD REFUSES TO ACCEPT 'STUPID PREMISE\u2019 THAT PRESS MISSED BIDEN\u2019S DECLINE\n\"You know, Joe Biden never should have been there in the first place, right? Number one, he shouldn't have run for president [in 2020],\" Todd said during a March appearance on Lincoln Project co-founder Steve Schmidt's \"The Warning\" podcast.\n\"I completely got so angry at Joe Biden, the man, when I read the transcript of the Hunter Biden trial, and when I realized that not one, not two, but three Biden children, and I count Beau's widow, were all dealing with drug problems in 2018. And Joe Biden said, 'Now's a perfect time to run for president, because who cares about our family?'\" he said.\nTodd argued that there was a \"mythology\" about Biden caring so much about his family.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBiden's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFox News' Kristine Parks contributed to this report."

Less than a month after the spectacle, where Biden looked weak and cognitively challenged, he announced his withdrawal from the campaign and endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the nominee.\nBiden\u2019s cognitive decline has been under more scrutiny in recent months as CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson\u2019s newly published book, \"Original Sin,\" alleged that members of Biden\u2019s White House engaged in a cover-up of the president\u2019s condition.\nIn the clip flagged by The Daily Caller, Leibovich prompted Todd\u2019s declaration by bringing up a previous conversation they had about some members of Biden\u2019s inner circle using the debate as an opportunity to punch through the cover-up and show the world that Biden was unfit for office.\nCHUCK TODD BLAMES SCHUMER, DEMOCRATS' SILENCE ON BIDEN DECLINE FOR PARTY'S CREDIBILITY COLLAPSE\nThe journalist mentioned \"the idea that there were actually people within the White House, within the Biden campaign who thought it would be a good thing to create some kind of daylight for the world to see what they were dealing with on a day-to-day basis.\"\nTodd followed up by saying that no matter what Biden\u2019s former senior adviser Anita Dunn and campaign co-chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon say, he thinks they were trying to expose his frailties.\n\"Anita Dunn and Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon will deny it till they\u2019re blue in the face, and if I were in their shoes and I did it, I\u2019d deny it until I was blue in my face, okay?\" Todd said.\n\"Of course, you\u2019d deny that,\" Leibovich agreed.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nTodd added, \"It\u2019s like whoever the hell helped Reagan delay the hostage release, okay? It\u2019s never going to be admitted. It\u2019s too convenient,\" referring to the January 1981 release of American hostages held by Iran, after Jimmy Carter had already lost his re-election effort to Reagan.\nGoing back to the alleged plot to expose Biden, Todd continued, \"There was no other reason. This idea, \u2018Well, we needed to shake up the race.\u2019 In late June? Who shakes up a race in late June?\"\n\"They knew when the nomination was going to be and they knew they needed to deal with this with an opportunity to make a change if it was necessary,\" Todd added. \"I will always believe this.\"\nReps for the former president did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
