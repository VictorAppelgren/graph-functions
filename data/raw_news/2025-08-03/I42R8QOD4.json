  "description": "A quarter million jobs vanished, yet no one new was fired and no one new quit. Those jobs never existed. Only our estimate of the truth changed, not the truth itself.",
  "content": "Last Friday, we learned we are less employed than we thought we were.\n\nA quarter million jobs vanished, yet no one new was fired and no one new quit. Those jobs never existed in the first place. Only our estimate of the truth changed, not the truth itself.\n\nThis was definitely a large revision. The two-month downward revision in jobs hadn\u2019t been this negative since Covid, and before that, the global financial crisis in October 2008. Before that, it hadn\u2019t happened in decades, with only a handful of occurrences in 1979, 1980, and 1982.\n\nIn response, the US equity market fell between one and two percent and Treasury bond yields collapsed, especially in the front-end, as the market began pricing in a substantially higher expectation of Fed rate cuts. President Trump ordered the firing of the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), citing \u201ca lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence.\u201d Should he have?\n\nUsually, revisions are frequent and fairly modest. The monthly nonfarm payroll report is always revised twice, so there are three numbers: the preliminary estimate, the first revision the following month, and the second revision in the month following that. There are also annual revisions.\n\nThe average magnitude of the revisions since 1979 are between 40,000 and 60,000 jobs. Sometimes we find out we are more employed than we thought we were, and sometimes less.\n\nOn Friday, the May 2025 seasonally adjusted estimate was revised down 120,000 jobs from its first estimate and the June 2025 estimate was revised down 133,000 jobs. Each of those was historically extreme, worse than 95% of relevant monthly revisions since 1979. The two-month combination was basically a once-in-a-decade event, as the chart above shows. Big numbers.\n\nBut ultimately, they are just one source of data. Jobs numbers help us think about the economy, but they are just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nWhat makes job numbers particularly useful is they may be forward-looking: rather than estimating historical consumer purchases, job creation can presage future spending. That\u2019s why revisions could matter too. You drive differently if you think your exit is three miles away than if you think it\u2019s a quarter mile away. But we can\u2019t live our lives in the past, constantly revising what we used to think about ancient history. So, when should a revision of the past change your perspective of the future?\n\nSurely, it should have some effect. One famous quote attributed to John Maynard Keynes summarizes this view: \u201cWhen the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\u201d\n\nOf course, not all facts matter the same amount or at the same time. Yesterday\u2019s future is tomorrow\u2019s past. Eventually, other data should matter more than the jobs numbers. If the BLS announced an inadvertent and unnoticed typo in a jobs number from eight years ago, that should presumably have almost no effect on your views today, since so much additional data has already come in, about spending, saving, production, consumption, inflation, and more.\n\nIn other words, those quarter million jobs either existed or not. Estimates and revisions won\u2019t change what actually happened. Even knowing the exact true number is only a proxy for the actual information you would be interested in, and as time has gone on, other data has come out that can be more valuable and important than a more accurate but more historically distant estimate.\n\nThere is a devastating counterpoint, however, as anyone who has ever been in any kind of personal or professional relationship would know. If a piece of information about the ancient past can change or color your perception of the entire relationship, then almost no amount of time can reduce that emotional impact. In any fight with a loved one, the biggest pain isn\u2019t whatever action they did or did not do, or your best estimate of their action, or even the revisions of your best estimates of their actions: it\u2019s the possibility that they never loved you at all. Was it all a lie?\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s firing of the BLS commissioner may be controversial. But both the administration and its critics worry about the same thing: data ought to be as accurate and objective as possible.\n\nThis issue is a lot like reading the news. The loud front pages say one thing, usually preliminary news. Later retractions or corrections are quiet and unnoticed. As a society, we can begin to split and live in two different worlds: those that did not know the truth and did not see the retraction, and those that knew the truth or saw the retraction. Therefore, we no longer even have the same facts. Some of us begin to live in the hallucinated, unrevised, unretracted world, a world much like the Mandela effect, where we swear we remember things that in fact never happened.\n\nTrust is a fragile thing. A good-faith revision here or a revision there can be fine. But if you notice a consistent bias or pattern in the revisions and retractions, if the errors are rarely in your favor, you may stop subscribing to that source of news or data. If you are in a relationship, you may look to end or fix it. If you are the President of the United States, you may seek a new commissioner. The primary challenge in all these cases is then the same: restore the trust.\n\nIn the revision economy and the retraction life, beliefs can bend, but faith can snap.",

  "summary": "The author discusses the revision economy and the retraction of a quarter million jobs, which have been eliminated without significant changes to their employment levels. This was a significant two-month downward revision, the largest since Covid and before the global financial crisis of the previous decade. The author argues that only our estimate of the truth changed, not the truth itself, when a revision of the past can change our perspective on the future. Despite these revisions, job numbers are useful as they can potentially predict future spending. However, other data, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), should also be considered more accurate and objective. The article suggests that while these revisions may change our view on the economy, they should not change the facts or actions taken or decisions made by the administration.",

      "text": "BLS Has Lengthy History of Inaccuracies, Incompetence\nA lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence by Erika McEntarfer, the former Biden-appointed Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has completely eroded public trust in the government agency charged with disseminating key data used by policymakers and businesses to make consequential decisions.\nUnder McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) consistently published overly optimistic jobs numbers \u2014 only for those numbers to be quietly revised later:\n- Today, BLS had to revise down May and June jobs reports by a combined 258,000 jobs. These previous faulty jobs reports enabled the Federal Reserve to continue its disastrous policy of keeping interest rates high.\n- On June 6, The New York Times reported: \u201cA solid jobs report for May has reinforced the Federal Reserve\u2019s stance that it can take its time before restarting interest rate cuts.\n- On July 3, The New York Times reported that the June jobs report \u201cfortifies the Federal Reserve\u2019s case that it does not need to be in a hurry to lower borrowing costs.\u201d\n- Last year, BLS revised down the benchmark payroll growth for the year ending in March 2024 by 818,000 jobs \u2014 the second-largest benchmark revision on record.\n- The Daily Caller: \u201cIncluding monthly revisions, the Biden administration overstated the number of jobs in the U.S. economy by 1.18 million in the year through March, accounting for approximately 36% of the 3.24 million jobs initially claimed, according to data from the BLS calculated by the Daily Caller News Foundation\u201d\n- In July 2024, BLS revised jobs added in May of that year down by 54,000 jobs, and the jobs added in April down by 57,000 jobs.\n- In April 2024, BLS revised the jobs added in February of that year down \u2014 then further revised the number down the following month.\n- In February 2024, BLS revised the jobs added in December of the prior year down by 43,000 jobs and the jobs added in January of that year down by 124,000 jobs.\n- Bloomberg, 11/15/24: \u201cTwo key Senate Republicans excoriated the US government statistics agency responsible for monthly employment reports, saying recent large-scale revisions to initial figures show its \u2018continued failures\u2019 in producing crucial economic data \u2026 A preliminary annual revision to the jobs data, made in August, suggested job growth in the 12 months through March will be marked down by more than 800,000 \u2014 the largest downward revision since 2009 \u2014 making waves in financial markets and on Capitol Hill. The final data is due early next year.\u201d\n- Bloomberg, 6/6/24: \u201cData published Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest payrolls might have grown about 60,000 less per month on average last year than the roughly 250,000 run-rate derived from the agency\u2019s monthly employment report.\u201d\n- The Heritage Foundation, 5/3/2024: \u201cThe BLS provides monthly estimates for the number of nonfarm payrolls across the country through a survey of over 600,000 businesses. According to that data, payrolls increased by 640,000 in the third quarter of last year \u2026 But now, the BLS has published its Business Employment Dynamics, or BED, report from that same period, and it shows a drop in private payrolls of 192,000. That\u2019s a mammoth difference of 832,000 for the months of July, August and September.\u201d\nDuring McEntarfer\u2019s tenure, BLS was consistently plagued by technical errors and leaks of sensitive information:\n- The Washington Post, 8/28/24: \u201cThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday that a technical issue caused delays last week in the scheduled release of jobs data that carried major implications for the economy and the presidential election. Outside parties, the BLS said, then got the data because of a lack of communication within the agency over how to respond to public inquiries \u2026 The episode is at least the third in a series of missteps this year that critics argue may undermine faith in the agency.\u201d\n- The Washington Post, 8/28/24: \u201cLast week\u2019s episode involved data closely watched by economists, Wall Street traders, and Federal Reserve officials who are keeping close tabs on employment as they prepare to cut interest rates. The lapse happened just days before the Fed sent its strongest signal yet that it was time to take pressure off the economy, in large part because officials fear that the labor market is softening \u2014 so financial markets were anticipating the release even more than usual.\u201d\n- The Washington Post, 8/28/24: \u201cThe job revisions for last year and early 2024 appeared on a government website about a half-hour after their scheduled release time. But despite the delay, a handful of financial firms were able to obtain the information \u2014 which showed the largest downward revision to annual job creation in 15 years \u2014 before it was posted publicly. The gaffe appeared to run counter to the nonpartisan statistical agency\u2019s long-standing policies intended to prevent individual stakeholders, particularly financial traders, from gaining any edge by ensuring that information is made widely accessible to everyone at the same time.\u201d\n- House Committee on Education and the Workforce, 12/10/24:\n- \u201cIn March [2024], news reports revealed a BLS economist shared nonpublic information with several Wall Street firms.\u201d\n- \u201cOn May 15[, 2024], BLS accidentally loaded data files to its website 30 minutes prior to the scheduled release time of the consumer price index.\u201d\n- \u201cOn August 21[, 2024], while the public waited for the release of the job numbers, some Wall Street firms got a head start as BLS released the numbers to firms that spoke to the agency by phone, potentially giving them an unfair advantage.\u201d\n- \u201cOn August 26[, 2024], Chairwoman Foxx and Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee Chairman Bob Good (R-VA) called out the Biden-Harris administration for exaggerating job growth when revised BLS numbers proved an overestimate of more than 800,000 jobs.\u201d\n- \u201cOn September 25[, 2024], to hold BLS accountable for its inability to ensure data is released uniformly and on time, Foxx and Good demanded answers from the Biden-Harris administration.\u201d\n- \u201cOn October 25[, 2024], after BLS ignored the congressional request and additional disturbing reports surfaced in the press about BLS actions the day of the job numbers release on [August 21, 2024], the Committee reupped its oversight inquiry and sent a follow-up letter to BLS.\u201d"
