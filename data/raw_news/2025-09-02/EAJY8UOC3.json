  "description": "When lay-offs hit my role as a senior copywriter at Virgin Media O2 in August 2023, I knew the job hunt wouldn\u2019t be easy. But two years, a drained bank account and a psychiatric unit later, I never imagined it would be this brutal.",
  "content": "When lay-offs hit my role as a senior copywriter at Virgin Media O2 in August 2023, I knew the job hunt wouldn\u2019t be easy. But two years, a drained bank account and a psychiatric unit later, I never imagined it would be this brutal.\n\nAfter a year or so of mass layoffs at major tech firms including Meta, Microsoft and Google \u2013 amid many others \u2013 Virgin Media O2 followed suit, giving 2,000 workers \u2013 12pc of its workforce \u2013 the chop.\n\nI lost jobs during the credit crunch and pandemic, but I found a new role with relative ease. This time it has been different. After the recent bloodbath of redundancies, those crises seem to pale compared with the challenges of 2025.\n\nUK unemployment stands at 4.7pc \u2013 the highest since 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics. Nearly 90,000 redundancies were made between March and May alone.\n\nVacancies have plunged. Employers are holding back hiring amid uncertainty. Recruiters say placements fell in June at the fastest rate in nearly two years \u2013 down 145,000 from a year ago and still below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThere are now 2.3 unemployed people per job vacancy, up from 1.7 before the pandemic. Five hundred applicants per role is now the norm.\n\nIt\u2019s brutal out there. Once you\u2019ve applied, you rarely hear back. Six in 10 jobseekers get no feedback after interviews, HR trade body the CIPD found.\n\nYou need to be superhuman to job hunt now without letting it grind you down. I\u2019ve applied for over 5,000 jobs on LinkedIn alone. Hours go into tweaking my CV, writing cover letters and answering irrelevant diversity questions about whether I believe in God and whether I fancy men, women or both. Yet I could count on my fingers the number of interviews I\u2019ve had.\n\nI\u2019ve applied for jobs outside my remit: retail, serving coffee, caring for the elderly. On the odd occasion I\u2019ve received feedback, the rejection is always because there are hundreds of people in front of me with more experience.\n\nRoyal Mail turned me down for a cleaning job at a depot because they had a long line of applicants with cleaning experience. A pre-school turned me down for looking after children with autism and gave it to someone with experience. The only way I can think of to get a look-in is to lie on my CV.\n\nThe endless effort with no return isn\u2019t a pain you can pinpoint like a toothache. It spreads everywhere \u2013 mentally, physically, financially. The turmoil consumes your waking hours. It follows you to bed and seeps into your nightmares.\n\nThis June, it became too much. My dad found me on the floor, curled in a ball, crying, self-harming and screaming that I didn\u2019t want to be here any more. I was admitted to a psychiatric unit.",
