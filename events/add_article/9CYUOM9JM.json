      "summary": "The S&P 500 is trading at historically high levels, largely driven by the Magnificent Seven tech giants that now make up over a third of the index. While the market has rallied 68% since early 2023, the steep Shiller CAPE ratio signals potential downside risk. An equal‑weight S&P 500 ETF, such as Invesco RSP, offers a more diversified exposure that could mitigate a pullback from the concentrated tech sector. The article also explains the mechanics of bull markets, the importance of valuation metrics like P/E, and cautions that sharp declines often follow peaks.",
