  "title": "iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 public beta: Everything you need to know about the new Apple updates",
  "description": "Preview the exciting changes coming to your iPhone this fall, including a new aesthetic called Liquid Glass, with the new public beta.",
  "content": "In just over a month, we'll finally get to download the official iOS 26 on our iPhones. Available now is the iOS 26 developer beta 6 (for developers only), and the public beta which you can download and install now. CEO Tim Cook recently said it's (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we\u2019ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\n\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\n\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant \u2014 first promised at WWDC 2024 \u2014 is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\n\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.\n\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it \u2014 version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.\n\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year \u2014 the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\n\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some \u2014 including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar \u2014 like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\n\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\n\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\n\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\n\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\n\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\n\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\n\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\n\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\n\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\n\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.\n\nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.\n\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\n\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\n\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\n\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\n\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\n\nCheckout our first impressions of iPadOS 26.\n\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\n\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\n\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\n\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\n\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS \u2014 iPhone XR, XS and XS Max \u2014 won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\u2022 None iPhone SE (second generation or later)\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.\n\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\n\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\n\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\n\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\n\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 \u2014 exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\n\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

      "text": "Apple's Liquid Glass is Windows Vista done well\nAero, is that you?\nIt's hard to look at Apple's new \"Liquid Glass\" aesthetic and not think about Windows Vista, Microsoft's much-maligned OS which also touted transparencies and glass-like effects as a bold new vision for computing. You can see the similarities between Apple's UI and Vista's \"Windows Aero\" design language everywhere, from the glassified app icons in iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26 which look a lot like VIsta's glossy icons, to the transparent backgrounds used in drop down menus, which hearken back to VIsta's transparent window borders. The key difference is that Apple is just doing it all better. (Sorry, not sorry, Windows fans.)\nWhile Microsoft started off with an intriguing idea, it failed to execute the Windows Aero UI well in Vista. Mostly, that's because Vista itself was a huge mess \u2014 it was far slower than Windows XP, it was notoriously buggy and it handled drivers poorly. And if you actually wanted to partake in the glory of Aero transparency bars, you needed a computer with a powerful GPU. That was far more rare in 2007 than it is today, when even integrated graphics can run basic 3D and fancy UI elements well. With its homegrown chips, Apple also provides decent graphics capabilities in its devices that support iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and other new software releases with Liquid Glass.\nIt also helps that Liquid Glass isn't really a huge change for Apple, unlike the jump from Windows XP to Vista. Apple has been creeping towards a flashier UI and more widespread use of transparencies ever since iOS 7 was released in 2013, which dropped the archaic skeuomorphic design trend in favor of a flatter and more stylish aesthetic. So sure, your icons and menus may have a bit more shine to them in iOS 26, but they mostly work the way you remember. (You could also argue Apple itself kickstarted the move towards transparencies in desktop operating systems with the original Mac OS X in 2001, which gave its iconic dock a glossy background.)\nI can argue for the overall wisdom of Apple's Liquid Glass, at least compared to Windows Vista, and personally I also think it gives iOS a much-needed dose of personality. But I can't really convince you otherwise if you think it looks ugly, as many of my Engadget colleagues do. Senior News Editor Avery Ellis calls it \"busy and obnoxious,\" and Editor-in-Chief Aaron Souppouris noted that \"it truly feels like Aero, rooted in the mid '00s.... I don't need light refracting around my pause button.\" Fair complaints! And as usual, you can also reduce transparency effects and motion elements in Apple's Accessibility Settings, if these elements truly bother you.\nBut after spending a bit of time with the first iOS 26 developer beta, I'm more intrigued by Liquid Glass than anything else. It makes app icons look like tiny jewels that I just want to touch, and I dig the transparency effects throughout the OS \u2014 they almost seem like a preview for a future where we're using holographic Apple devices. (That's also something I felt while using visionOS on the Vision Pro, which served as the launchpad for Liquid Glass.) I also genuinely love iOS 26's revamped Safari, which lets you browse completely in full screen. As you scroll down, the location bar at the bottom of your screen shrinks and gets out of the way. But if you scroll up or tap into the location bar, it pops back up to give you the sharing and navigation options you're used to.\nIt could also be that I'm a sucker for novelty. Back in my Windows XP days, I used to use apps like WindowBlinds to customize the OS and add transparent effects. And there are signs that Apple may be going a bit too far with transparencies, like with the iOS 26's Control Center (above). It looks fine if you're swiping it down while inside an app, but if you're on the home screen, it's just one of many levels of glass-like windows. I could see that being a bit overbearing for some users.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that interface redesigns are often rejected at first glance, especially since you\u2019re seeing them abstracted through screenshots and videos. Even Apple\u2019s slick marketing magic doesn\u2019t replicate the experience of using Liquid Design. In my experience, iOS 26 really isn\u2019t that different from everything that came before. Once you get over the initial shock of a new interface, you may see it with new eyes.\nThere's also still plenty of time until Apple's new operating systems arrive this fall though, and the company is often quick to tweak major design changes if beta users complain about them. I could see Apple toning down the Control Center's transparent background, or even better, giving users more control over the amount of Liquid Glass elements on your screen. Personally, I don\u2019t mind it when companies stretch their interface ideals a bit too far \u2013 there\u2019s always room to move back. That\u2019s far better than being too conservative and never really pushing your aesthetic vision forward."

      "text": "iPadOS 26 preview: A long-awaited multi-tasking update pays off (so far)\nApple called this the biggest iPad update ever, and this time it's not hyperbole.\nI\u2019m not going to beat around the bush: iPadOS 26 and its new multitasking features are a game-changer for Apple\u2019s tablets. Pretty much ever since Steve Jobs introduced the iPad 15 years ago (!), Apple has tried to straddle two worlds. In one, the iPad is a super-simple, easy-to-use tablet with a gorgeous display and tons of good apps from the App Store for gaming, entertainment and light work. The other world is one where the iPad replaces your traditional computer, letting people do the serious work that\u2019s been typically reserved for a Mac or Windows PC. iPadOS has too often served as a hindrance to the latter goal over the years, particularly as the iPad Pro has gotten more powerful.\nThe Stage Manager multitasking experience Apple introduced with iPadOS 16 in 2022 was a major step towards making the iPad\u2019s software suitable for power users \u2014 but it was rather buggy at launch and not as flexible as iPad power users were hoping for. The calls to just put macOS on the iPad grew louder. But this year, Apple took a different approach: it brought crucial macOS features like the familiar \u201cstoplight\u201d window controls, the menu bar at the top of the screen and vastly improved window management tools to iPadOS 26. The result is an iPad experience where you can easily jump between multiple windowed apps set up just how you like and one where you go full screen to focus on your content. It\u2019s a massive refinement over the old Stage Manager experience and one that I think will finally satisfy iPad die-hards who want to push their tablets to the limit.\nBefore diving into the details, a quick word on betas and stability. As usual, Apple\u2019s public betas feel pretty stable and capable, but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t run into weirdness here and there. App crashes, particularly with third-party apps, happened far more on this beta than with iPadOS 18. I\u2019m confident those things will be ironed out as more developers update their apps for the new OS, but you\u2019ll also run into things like UI inconsistencies and occasional stutters and jerkiness when jumping between apps. As we always say, think hard about what you\u2019re willing to put up with to try a beta, even the relatively stable public beta. After all, the final version of iPadOS 26 will be out in just a few months.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means, as Nate stated above, you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy software. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nMultitasking\nTime for the nitty-gritty. When you update to iPadOS 26, you\u2019ll be asked if you want to enable multitasking or have apps run in full screen mode only. When Apple says full screen only, they mean it. Past versions of iPadOS offered either Stage Manager or a basic, two-app split screen view with a third app available in a Slide Over window. The latter option is gone now, though you can still easily set up two or three apps side by side with iPadOS 26\u2019s window tiling features. You can use multitasking mode or full screen only, with no in between. I think that\u2019s a smart move, as plenty of people who use an iPad probably never use these multi-app features, and having a \u201cmultitasking on or off\u201d toggle keeps things simple.\nWhen you turn on multitasking mode, apps still open in full screen first \u2014 but you can grab any corner of the window to resize it or touch the top of the app and drag it around the screen. You could already do this with Stage Manager, so what really sets this new mode apart is how it interacts with other windows. Swiping up from the bottom of the display reveals the usual Home Screen view, but with your apps tucked to the side as a visual cue that you can add another app to that group. And, as before, you can move, resize and stack that app window wherever you want.\nAs I\u2019m writing this, I have nine separate app windows open on my iPad, and getting around them feels more Mac-like than ever before. I can swipe up and hold from the bottom of the Home Screen and see every open app in a smaller window, which makes finding the specific thing I want a lot easier; I can also just command-tab through them. Apps can be minimized down to the dock and when I want the app back, it\u2019ll pop open in the same size window and same placement as before. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen twice minimizes everything I have open to start fresh \u2014 but again, if I reopen those apps, they\u2019ll go back to exactly where I had them set up before.\nI realize it sounds kind of silly to make a big deal of this, but it\u2019s hard to overstate how much this improves the iPad multitasking experience. With Stage Manager, I was never quite sure where an app would open or if it would be full screen or windowed. It can be useful for setting up multiple groups of apps, but adding and removing apps from that view was not terribly intuitive. Just opening everything in one space is a lot more intuitive. And if you want to have various different spaces with specific apps, you can still turn on Stage Manager. It\u2019s a lot easier to add and remove apps from various different groups than it used to be; minimizing a window puts it into its own space that you can add more apps to (or just use it on its own).\nThere are a few other new components that make multitasking work as well as it does. These should be quite familiar to Mac users: The three-button \u201cstoplight\u201d controls and the menu bar. The stoplight buttons replace a similar three-dot window management system from older versions of iPadOS but are far more intuitive. The red one closes an app window entirely, the green one makes a window full screen and then yellow one minimizes it to the dock. These controls are crucial to making iPadOS 26 feel more flexible and fluid than ever before, particularly if you want to have more than one window of a single app open. I\u2019ve also found them to be crucial when working with multiple apps on a smaller display, like on the 11-inch iPad Pro. Stage Manager usually felt like more trouble than it was worth on anything but a 13-inch iPad, but these new multitasking features make it easy to flip through a bunch of apps and pop into full screen if I need more space.\nThe expanded window tiling controls here also make that easier. If you press and hold the stoplight buttons, you\u2019ll get more options to resize apps to take up a quarter, third or half the screen; you can also grab drag bars to further adjust how much space each app takes up. I really liked a mode where three iPhone-sized apps fill the screen, and when there was something I wanted to devote more focus to, I just hit its green button and went full screen.\nThe menu bar, meanwhile, is pretty easy to explain. If you swipe down from the top of the screen (or move your trackpad cursor up to the top) you\u2019ll see familiar menus like File, Edit, Window and so on. It\u2019s a handy way to find more advanced controls for an app, and it also keeps the various toolbars in apps from getting too overloaded with options.\nLong story short, this all adds up to a wildly improved iPad experience. It doesn\u2019t compromise the single-screen, focused mode that the iPad has always been known for, and it greatly improves working across multiple windows and apps. And unlike Stage Manager, which was limited to M-series iPads, these new multitasking features will work on any iPad that can run iPadOS 26, including the base A16 iPad and the iPad mini.\nEverything else\nIf this was the only change to iPadOS Apple made this year, it would already be a worthwhile upgrade, but there are a bunch of other improvements coming this fall. These include an improved Files app, the Preview app that has long been a core part of macOS, the new Liquid Glass design, some potentially useful Apple Intelligence features, a nice set of updates to the Messaging app and a new Phone app.\nMuch has been said about Liquid Glass, with tons of prognostication about how Apple was ruining usability and throwing its UI back to 2006 in a blatant Windows Aero ripoff. As usual, the truth is much more nuanced. No one familiar with Apple\u2019s software will be thrown off by this update \u2014 everything works as it did before, and while you\u2019ll definitely notice some refractive visual elements, it\u2019s not the wholesale change that aggrieved social media posters would have you believe. You can make things look very different if you, say, opt for the new clear glass icon look, but you can also leave the standard colorful iOS icons in place.\nOver the course of the developer betas Apple has released since WWDC, the company has responded to feedback and reduced some of the transparency effects that were present in the first version of Liquid Glass \u2014 as it turns out, submitting feedback during a beta works! (Interestingly, they bumped some of the transparency back up in the fourth developer beta, right after turning it down in beta 3. This is still a work in progress.) Probably the biggest functional change is that app controls, toolbars and sidebars float over apps in a new, distinct layer rather than being wholly separate from an app\u2019s content \u2014 but again, it\u2019s not the kind of thing that\u2019ll faze anyone who has been using an iPad or any other Apple device.\nPreview isn\u2019t exactly a thriller, but it\u2019s a much better way to work with PDFs and images than the old interface that launched them in a separate Files window. You can still find PDFs in Files easily enough, but actually dealing with the document in a separate app is better than making Files pull double duty.\nSpeaking of Files, it has even more in common with the Mac Finder than before. You can now put specific folders in the dock for faster access to whatever you\u2019re working on, and the app list view has resizable columns and collapsible folders, just like on the Mac. You can also add emoji and colors to folders for more visual differentiation (and, let\u2019s be honest, a little more fun). And for the first time, you can pick specific apps to open different file types by default \u2014 so if you\u2019d rather have PNG images open in Photomator than Preview, go nuts.\nThere are also major updates to the communication experience across the board in iPadOS 26. The FaceTime app got a nice redesign with large contact posters of your recent calls. But what\u2019s most handy here is that the FaceTime app no longer tries to do double-duty with voice calls. A dedicated Phone app handles that now. Assuming you also have an iPhone, you\u2019ll see all your recent voice calls and voicemails here and you can quickly place a new call through your contact list or using a traditional dialer. I\u2019ve always liked the idea of being able to place calls on devices I\u2019m using during the work day like my Mac or iPad, and this makes it far easier.\nMessages is getting some fun visual enhancements like backgrounds for your conversations, but the thing I\u2019m most interested in is message filtering. The app now identifies unknown senders and puts those messages in a separate folder, and there\u2019s also a new spam folder where it drops messages that Apple strongly believes are spam.\nIf a message gets filtered into unknown senders or spam, you can mark it as known even if the contact isn\u2019t in your address book and those messages will end up in your main view by default. The system also attempts to recognize when a message from an unknown sender is timely and needs to be delivered to your main inbox \u2014 something like a delivery person saying they\u2019re nearby or other urgent content like a two-factor authentication code. This feels primarily like a phone-first feature; I get messages on my iPad, but haven\u2019t seen much get filtered directly to spam or unknown callers yet. Once all my devices are running Apple\u2019s latest software, we\u2019ll see how that goes, but I\u2019m still very excited about any feature that\u2019ll help combat the deluge of spam messages that plague my inbox.\nFor more details on the updated communications experience and other new features like the Apple Intelligence-powered Live Translation, I\u2019ll point you to my colleague Mat Smith\u2019s iOS 26 overview. As is usually the case, nearly every feature coming to the iPhone this year is also coming to the iPad, meaning Live Translation will arrive on the tablet too.\nThere\u2019s a lot more here that I haven\u2019t been able to get to, like improved background tasks that let you export a video without keeping the app in focus, updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, the Journal app finally coming to iPad, Apple Intelligence-powered Shortcuts updates and much more. I\u2019ll be continuing to check out how things change between now and the final release this fall, but even based on my experience with the recent beta, I\u2019m quite pleased with where iPadOS 26 is at. The updates to multitasking are so significant that I can\u2019t imagine going back to an iPad without them."

Apple has been meeting with OpenAI and Anthropic to discuss a potential deal that would see a third-party large language model used as the backbone for Siri.\nBoth companies are training versions of their models that would work with Apple's Private Cloud Compute servers, and Apple is running tests, but hasn't made a final decision on whether to abandon Siri. So far, Apple has found that Anthropic's AI models are the best fit for Siri, and Apple and Anthropic have already discussed some preliminary financial terms. Bloomberg says that Anthropic is asking for a multibillion-dollar annual fee that increases over time, which is why Apple is also considering partnering with other companies like OpenAI.\nApple has been training a large language model for a future version of Siri, but it is no secret that Apple has been struggling with AI. Apple previewed several new Siri capabilities at the June 2024 WWDC keynote and advertised the iPhone 16 models with the functionality, but ultimately wasn't able to develop the technology in time.\nIn March, Apple said that the Apple Intelligence Siri features would be delayed until 2026, sparking customer outrage and spurring several lawsuits. Apple now plans to introduce those features in an update to iOS 26.\nApple's work on an LLM version of Siri is separate from the personalized Siri features that are coming in iOS 26. LLM Siri is planned as a follow up to the new features coming in iOS 26, and it will presumably debut in iOS 27 in the fall of 2026.\nPartnering with Anthropic or OpenAI would give Apple time to work on its own AI models while still delivering modern AI features that customers have come to expect.

      "text": "How Apple redesigned its Photos app around customization\nAnd why that will reduce doomscrolling.\nMy relationship with my iPhone\u2019s Photos app is complicated. It\u2019s both my trove of memories and my secret pile of shame. I have thousands of pictures from trips, outings and gatherings with loved ones, but thousands more of myself, food and random internet stuff (tweets, Reddit posts and crossword puzzle hints). Throw in private pictures of things like my tax documents or IDs and the Photos app probably holds all the most important and sensitive things in my life. I spend hours on it each day. I\u2019d be lost without the 73,600 photos and 2,607 videos I\u2019ve stored in it (and the 600GB in my Google Photos of course, I only switched to iOS two years ago).\nSo when Apple announced a redesign was coming in iOS 18 (and iPadOS 18), I was skeptical and worried. Change? I hate it. My fingers already know exactly where the buttons are; having to relearn everything would suck. How else would I quickly find the screenshots I need?\nThe good news is, the iOS 18 redesign for the Photos app might make things easier to pull up. Better yet, it could allow people to use their albums in ways that best meet their needs \u2014 perhaps those of you who are more utilitarian and less vain about it could benefit too.\nI got a closer look at the upcoming changes at WWDC last month. But last week I got a deeper dive when I spoke with Della Huff, Billy Sorrentino and Jon McCormack from Apple\u2019s Photos, design and software teams to learn more about why and how the app was redesigned.\nHow will the redesigned Photos app look in iOS 18?\nAt first glance, your Photos might not look too different. As shown off at WWDC 2024, all your pictures will still be the first thing you see. Peer just slightly beyond the surface, though, and the changes are obvious. Gone are the tabs below your images that say \u201cLibrary,\u201d \u201cFor You,\u201d \u201cAlbums\u201d and \u201cSearch.\u201d And instead of your grid taking up basically the entire page, it now ends about two thirds of the way, with rows of albums showing up below.\nI have to say that I was initially annoyed with this change, but once I heard my entire library is just a swipe down away, I was massively relieved. Well, mostly, anyway. The bar at the bottom that lets you jump between annual, monthly, daily and all views will now show years, months and all. That\u2019s fine by me, since I rarely use the daily option.\nA new filter button at the bottom left lets you choose what to focus on or cut out of the grid, like screenshots, favorites, portraits, videos and edited images. Swiping sideways will show various collections, either generated by your phone or created by yourself.\nThe idea is to reduce \u201cdoomscrolling through the grid,\u201d Huff said, referencing an idea McCormack had mentioned before. With over three trillion photos and videos taken each year, Apple users probably don\u2019t want to sit around weeding through blurry shots or screenshots. Helping them get to what they want more quickly is one of the main focuses of the redesign.\nBut like I said, too much change sucks. Sorrentino said, \u201cIt was critical from the very beginning of this design process that we didn't lose any key features that people love today.\u201d So far, it does look like the stuff I use most frequently is either still there or even easier to reach. And though I find it unnecessary that each collection will autoplay as a memory in the redesign, at least it will look nice and won\u2019t take up extra space.\nWhen you swipe to the right of the grid, you\u2019ll see the new Photos Carousel, highlighting what Apple thinks is your best content. This uses \u201con-device intelligence\u201d that has been in the app and evolving for 15 years and considers data like the people in the shots and the location they were taken in to create mini movies of your outings and activities.\nDon\u2019t confuse this with Apple Intelligence, though. This is simply algorithms. In fact, McCormack called it an \u201cintuition.\u201d For example, he said \u201ciPhone knew who my partner was long before I told iPhone who my partner was.\u201d The team is building on the same system that\u2019s been identifying faces and generating Memories here, and in iOS 18 it will start surfacing photo sets featuring groups of people and pets like you and your parents, your partner and your pet or you and your partner. There will also be new collections like \"recently edited\" and \"a smart receipts album that you can put right at the top with pinned collections,\" Huff said.\nShe pointed out that in the redesigned Photos app \"there's a number of new dimensions and types of content that we're surfacing, like receipts and documents, handwriting, QR codes and more.\" These can lead to more efficient and relevant search results to help drill down into your library.\nHow do Apple Intelligence features in the new Photos app work?\nApple Intelligence will bring a few new tools to the Photos app, like Cleanup to erase distractions in the background and text prompts to create narrative Memories with storylines. It\u2019ll also enable a \u201cnatural language search\u201d that\u2019ll let you find a picture by describing what\u2019s in them so you won\u2019t have to try to remember where or when the event happened, or worse, doomscroll. It should be as easy as typing \u201cflaming praying mantis with a group of people in shock\u201d instead of searching through the hundreds of pictures you took in Las Vegas. These will require you to have at least an iPhone 15 Pro, though.\nDuring my time with Huff, Sorrentino and McCormack, I learned that Cleanup works on all images in your Photos app, so you could use it in screenshots or downloaded pictures, too. McCormack explained that when you use Cleanup on an image taken in Portrait mode, \"we will clean up the original image and then reapply the depth of field effect.\"\nApple uses \"three different AI models\" to remove background distractions, McCormack said. The first will \"understand the clutter so that when you click on something, we know what to make go away.\" The other two are an \"in-filling model\" to replace the hole, as well as one that will understand \"the segmentation boundaries of the subject.\" The latter will prevent Cleanup from leaving divots in your subject's head or accidentally giving them an unflattering haircut.\nWhat can you customize and why does it matter?\nBecause the new Photos app features collections so heavily, the fact that you can create and pin them where you want makes your favorite images easy to get to. Basically, the entire area below the grid is your playground. \u201cYou can organize the structure of the app itself,\u201d Sorrentino said. You can \u201cturn on or off any section of the app,\u201d or reorganize it.\nMy favorite person is myself, so I\u2019m probably going to put my best selfies in a collection and have it be the one I see first after swiping on the grid. But as part of the collections below the grid, I\u2019m going to have the crochet patterns I\u2019ve taken screenshots of as one I pin high up, as well as important information i frequently refer to like my airline loyalty account numbers.\nThe beauty of customization in general is how each person can tailor an interface to their individual needs. Maybe you prefer to use Photos a bit more like Pinterest, where you screenshot the car models you're considering buying and put them in an album. Or perhaps you're tracking your meals by taking pictures of your food daily to help plan a menu. Or you're cataloging your outfit, your garden, your stamp collection, or your growing child. You'll be able to create a collection of the photos you want and pin them.\nI haven't spent time with the new Photos app yet, so though I'm excited at the promise of what customizability can bring, I'm also reserving judgment. I also enjoy doomscrolling my gallery while I look back at my weekend, since it visually represents my train of thought through the days. Sometimes, I use screenshots to remind myself to do something later in the evening when I'm inevitably staring at pictures of my friend's cute baby again. So the idea of letting Apple filter out what it thinks might be insignificant isn't something that appeals to my control-freak self. Luckily, it seems I can still view all images in my library.\nI'd also like to see how the Cleanup tool performs, as well as whether the \"natural language search\" will perform well compared to Google's recently announced Ask Photos tool. And though I don't create or watch many Memories, I'd be curious about what a video derived from a prompt like \"all my outfits from athleisure to formal\" would look like.\niOS 18 and iPadOS 18 are currently available to developers as a closed beta, and a public beta is expected later this summer. The full release of the new software is likely to drop in the fall, which is when most people will probably receive the redesigned Photos app when they update their iPhones. Still a few months to go before your fingers have to relearn where everything is, then."

      "text": "iOS 26 beta preview: Liquid Glass is better than you think\nApple\u2019s big design shift adjusts to fit reality.\nAt WWDC 2025, Apple revealed a major visual shake-up for iOS (not to mention the rest of the company\u2019s operating systems). This is the biggest change, aesthetically, since the shift away from the stitching, textures and skeuomorphic design of the iOS 4. It also comes with significantly fewer AI and Siri updates this time around. However, it\u2019s the smaller touches that make iOS 26 seem like a notable improvement over its predecessor.\nI\u2019ve been running the iOS 26 developer beta for the last two weeks and here's how Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design \u2014 and iOS 26 broadly \u2014 stacks up.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nLiquid Glass changes everything\niOS 26 looks new and modern. And for once, how Apple describes it \u2014 liquid glass \u2014 makes sense: it\u2019s a lot of layers of transparent elements overlapping and, in places, the animations are quite\u2026 liquidy. Menus and buttons will respond to your touch, with some of them coalescing around your finger and sometimes separating out into new menus.\nLiquid Glass encompasses the entire design of iOS. The home and lock screens have been redesigned once again, featuring a new skyscraping clock font that stretches out from the background of your photos, with ever-so-slight transparency. There\u2019s also a new 3D effect that infuses your photos with a bit of spatial magic, offering a touch of Vision Pro for iPhone users.\nThe experience in the first few builds of the iOS 26 beta was jarring and messy, especially with transparent icons and notifications, due to those overlapping elements making things almost illegible. Updates across subsequent releases have addressed this issue by making floating elements more opaque. There is also a toggle within the Accessibility tab in Settings to reduce transparency further, but I hope Apple offers a slider so that users can choose exactly how \u201cliquid\u201d they want their \u201cglass\u201d to be. If you own other Apple products, then you\u2019ll come to appreciate the design parity across your Mac, iPad and Apple Watch.\nOne noticeable change I'd been waiting for was the iOS search bar\u2019s relocation to the bottom of the screen. I first noticed it within Settings, but it reappears in Music, Podcasts, Photos and pretty much everywhere you might need to find specific files or menu items now. If, like me, you\u2019re an iPhone Pro or Plus user, you may have struggled to reach those search bars when they were at the top of the screen. It\u2019s a welcome improvement.\nVisual Intelligence\nWith iOS 26 on iPhones powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, the company is bringing Visual Intelligence over to your screenshots. (Previously it was limited to Camera.) Once you\u2019ve grabbed a shot by pressing the power and volume up buttons, you\u2019ll get a preview of your image, surrounded by suggested actions that Apple Intelligence deduced would be relevant based on the contents of your screenshot.\nManaging Editor Cherlynn Low did a deep dive on what Visual Intelligence is capable of. From a screenshot, you can transfer information to other apps without having to switch or select them manually. This means I can easily screenshot tickets and emails, for example, to add to my calendar. Apple Intelligence can also identify types of plants, food and cars, even. If there are multiple people or objects in your screenshot, you can highlight what you want to focus on by circling it. There aren\u2019t many third-party app options at this point, but that\u2019s often the case with a beta build. These are features that Android users have had courtesy of Gemini for a year or two, but at least now we get something similar on iPhones.\nOne quick tip: Make sure to tap the markup button (the little pencil tip icon) to see Visual Intelligence in your screenshots. I initially thought my beta build was missing the feature, but it was just hidden behind the markup menu.\nMore broadly, Apple Intelligence continues to work well, but doesn't stand out in any particular way. We\u2019re still waiting for Siri to receive its promised upgrades. Still, iOS 26 appears to have improved the performance of many features that use the iPhone\u2019s onboard machine learning models. Since the first developer build, voice memos and voice notes are not only much faster, but also more accurate, especially with accents that the system previously struggled with.\nApple Intelligence\u2019s Writing tools \u2014 which I mainly use for summarizing meetings, conference calls and even lengthy PDFs \u2014 doesn't choke with more substantial reading. On iOS 18, it would struggle with voice notes longer than 10 minutes, trying to detangle or structure the contents of a meeting. I haven\u2019t had that issue with iOS 26 so far.\nGenmoji and Image Playground both offer up different results through the update. Image Playground can now generate pictures using ChatGPT. I\u2019ll be honest, I hadn\u2019t used the app since I tested it on iOS 18, but the upgrades mean it has more utility when I might want to generate AI artwork, which can occasionally reach photorealistic levels.\nOne useful addition is ChatGPT\u2019s \u201cany style\u201d option, meaning you can try to specify the style you have in mind, which can skirt a little closer to contentious mimicry \u2014 especially if you want, say, a frivolous image of you splashing in a puddle, Studio Ghibli style.\nApple also tweaked Genmoji to add deeper customization options, but these AI-generated avatars don\u2019t look like me? I liked the original Genmoji that launched last year, which had the almost-nostalgic style of 2010 emoji, but still somehow channeled the auras of me, my friends and family. This new batch are more detailed and elaborate, sure, but they don\u2019t look right. Also, they make me look bald. And contrary to my detractors, I am not bald. Yet. This feels like a direct attack, Apple.\nYou might feel differently, however. For example, Cherlynn said that the first version of Genmoji did not resemble her, frequently presenting her as someone with much darker skin or of a different ethnicity, regardless of the source picture she submitted.\nStill, the ability to change a Genmoji\u2019s expression, as well as add and remove glasses and facial hair through the new appearance customization options, is an improvement.\nA Camera app redesign for everyone\nApple has revisited the camera app, returning to basics by stripping away most of the previously offered modes and settings \u2014 at least initially \u2014 to display only video and photo modes.\nYou can swipe up from the bottom to see additional options, like flash, the timer, exposure, styles and more. You can also tap on the new six-dot icon in the upper right of the interface for the same options, though that requires a bit more of a reach. These behave in line with the new Liquid Glass design and you\u2019ll see the Photo pill expand into the settings menu when you press either area. Long-pressing on icons lets you go deeper into shooting modes, adjusting frame rates and even recording resolutions.\nWhat I like here is that it benefits casual smartphone photographers while keeping all the settings that more advanced users demand. None of the updates here are earth-shattering, though. I hope Apple takes a good look at what Adobe\u2019s Project Indigo camera app is doing \u2014 there are a lot of good ideas there.\nOne extra improvement if you use AirPods: Pressing and holding the stem of your AirPod (if it has an H2 chip) can now start video recording.\nApple Music tries to DJ\nAlongside the Liquid Glass design touches, the big addition to Apple Music this year is AutoMix. Like a (much) more advanced version of the crossfade feature found on most music streaming apps, in iOS 26, Music tries to mix between tracks, slowing or speeding up tempos, gently fading in drums or bass loops before the next song kicks in. Twenty percent of the time, it doesn\u2019t work well \u2014 or Apple Music doesn\u2019t even try. But the new ability to pin playlists and albums is useful, especially for recommendations from other folks that you never got around to listening to.\nMessages get a little more fun\nApple is making Messages more fun. One of the ways it\u2019s doing so is by enabling custom backgrounds in chats, much like in WhatsApp. I immediately set out to find the most embarrassing photo of my colleague (and frenemy) Cherlynn Low and make it our chat background. I know she\u2019s also running iOS 26 in beta, so she will see it. [Ed. note: Way to give me a reason to ignore your messages, Mat!]\nApple\u2019s Live translation now works across Messages, voice calls and FaceTime. Setting things up can be a little complicated \u2014 you\u2019ll first need to download various language files to use the feature. There\u2019s also some inconsistency in the languages supported across the board. For instance, Mandarin and Japanese are supported in Messages, but not on FaceTime yet. In chats, if your system language is set to English or Spanish, then you\u2019ll only be able to translate into English or Spanish. For those polyglots out there, if you want to translate incoming Japanese texts into German, you\u2019ll need to set your device's language to German.\nWhile I didn\u2019t get to flex my Japanese abilities on voice calls and FaceTime, iOS 26 was more than capable of keeping up with some rudimentary German and Spanish. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d rely on it for serious business translation or holiday bookings, but I think it could be a very useful tool for basics.\nThere\u2019s also the ability to filter spam messages to their own little folder (purgatory). Spam texts remain a nightmare, so I appreciate any potential weapons in the fight. Sadly, it hasn\u2019t quite manage to deal with the TikTok marketing agencies and phone network customer services that continue to barrage my Messages. Still, hopefully Apple will continue to improve its detection algorithms.\nOne more tool in the battle against spam: You can mute notifications for Messages from unknown numbers, although time-sensitive alerts from delivery services and rideshare apps will still reach you.\nNew apps are hit-or-miss\nNot everything in the beta lands, however. I\u2019ve already touched on how Liquid Glass was initially a semi-transparent mess. The Games App, too, seems like an unnecessary addition. Because it\u2019s a blend of the Games tab of the App Store and a silo of your preinstalled games, I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s adding. It\u2019s not any easier to navigate, nor does it introduce me to games I want to buy.\nCherlynn did want to highlight that for a casual gamer like herself, it\u2019s intriguing to see if the Games app might start to recommend more mind-numbing puzzles or farming simulations. She was also intrigued by the idea of a more social gaming experience on iOS, issuing challenges to her friends. Still, because the phone she has been testing the beta on doesn\u2019t have access to all her contacts or her gaming history, the recommendations and features are fairly limited at the moment.\nGames is one of two new apps that will automatically join your home screen. (Fortunately, they can be uninstalled). The other is Preview, which should be a familiar addition to any Mac user. It offers an easy way to view sent or downloaded files, like menus, ticket QR codes and more. During the developer beta, the app pulled in a handful of my documents that previously lived in the Files app. Navigation across both those apps is identical, although Preview is limited to files you can actually open, of course.\nAirPods, upgraded\nThis is more iPhone-adjacent, but iOS 26 includes several quality-of-life improvements for some of Apple\u2019s headphones. First up: notifications when your AirPods are fully charged, finally! The Apple Watch got this kind of notification back in iOS 14, so it\u2019s great to see Apple\u2019s headphones catch up.\nApple is also promising \u201cstudio-quality sound recording\u201d from the AirPods, augmenting recordings with computational audio improvements. There\u2019s a noticable bump in audio quality. It appears that AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 will record files at a sample rate of 48 kHz, which is double the rate used in the past. The sample rate bump happened last year, but it is dependent on what the app you're using. Is it \u201cstudio quality\u201d? I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s an improvement. While recordings sound slightly better in quiet locations, the bigger change is in loud environments. The algorithm doesn't appear to be degrading audio quality as much while trying to reduce background noise.\niOS 26 also adds sleep detection to the buds. If the AirPods detect minimal movement, they\u2019ll switch off automatically, which could be helpful for the next time I\u2019m flying long-haul.\nWrap-up\nIn iOS 26, Apple has prioritized design changes and systemwide consistency over AI-centric software and features. While Liquid Glass is a big change to how your iPhone looks, Apple has drawn from user feedback to finesse the design into feeling less jarring and gelling better when the home screen, Control Center and Notification drop-downs overlap with each other.\nThere are numerous quality of life improvements, including Messages and Visual Intelligence, in particular. If anything, the AI elephant in the room is the lack of any substantial updates on Siri. After the company talked up advanced Siri interactions over a year ago, I\u2019m still waiting for its assistant to catch up with the likes of Google."

      "text": "iOS 26 can freeze your FaceTime video if it detects nudity\nThe feature is currently in beta and may be intended for child accounts only.\nThe developer beta for iOS 26 has been out for a few weeks, and as always,tech sleuths are uncovering features and details that weren't explained during WWDC. Among the latest discoveries stirring up conversation online is a safety and privacy feature for FaceTime that blurs your feed when it detects you in a state of undress. Should FaceTime detect nudity, it will display a message reading \"Audio and video are paused because you may be showing something sensitive. If you feel uncomfortable, you should end the call.\"\nOriginally discovered by X user @iDeviceHelpus, the feature is off by default and can be enabled in FaceTime settings under \"Sensitive Content Warning.\" The feature reads, \"Detect nude photos and videos before they are viewed on your device, and receive guidance to help make a safe choice. Apple does not have access to the photos or videos.\"It seems the feature is intended for child accounts, though it can currently be enabled in the beta for adults as well.\nThe Apple support page for the company's \"Communication Safety\" features reads, \"Communication Safety uses on-device machine learning to analyze photo and video attachments and determine if a photo or video appears to contain nudity. Because the photos and videos are analyzed on your child's device, Apple doesn't receive an indication that nudity was detected and doesn't get access to the photos or videos as a result.\"\nFeatures in beta come and go, as testing and feedback are partly the point of the beta system, so this may or may not see broader adoption. The public beta for iOS 26 is slated for July."

      "text": "iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework\nRemember Apple's promises about an assistant that knew what was on your screen and would suggest actions?\nWhen it launched, Apple 's Visual Intelligence feature allowed you to point your compatible phone's camera at things around you and either perform a Google Image Search or ask questions via ChatGPT. At WWDC 2025, the company showed off updates to broaden the usefulness of Visual Intelligence, largely by embedding it into the screenshots system. To quote the company's press release, \"Visual intelligence already helps users learn about objects and places around them using their iPhone camera, and it now enables users to do more, faster, with the content on their iPhone screen.\"\nThis reminded me of the \"onscreen awareness\" that Apple described as one of Siri's capabilities when it announced Apple Intelligence last year. In that press release, the company said, \"With onscreen awareness, Siri will be able to understand and take action with users\u2019 content in more apps over time.\" Though it's not quite the same, the updated screenshot-based Visual Intelligence more or less allows for your iPhone to serve up contextual actions from your onscreen content, just not via Siri.\nIn a way, it makes sense. Most people are already accustomed to taking a screenshot when they want to share or save important information they saw on a website or Instagram post. Integrating Apple Intelligence actions here would theoretically put the tools where you expect them, rather than make users talk to Siri (or wait for the update to roll out).\nBasically, in iOS 26 (on devices that support Apple Intelligence), pressing the power and volume up buttons to take a screenshot will result in a new page being pulled up. Instead of the thumbnail of your saved image appearing in the bottom left, you'll see the picture take up almost all of the display, with options around it for editing, sharing or saving the file, as well as getting Apple Intelligence-based answers and actions at the bottom. In the bottom left and right corners sit options for asking ChatGPT and doing a Google Image Search respectively.\nDepending on what's in your screenshot, Apple Intelligence can suggest various actions below your image. This can be asking where to buy a similar-looking item, adding an event to your calendar or identifying types of plants, animals or food, for instance. If there's a lot going on in your screenshot, you can draw on an item to highlight it (similar to how you select an object to erase in Photos) and get information specific to that part of the image.\nThird-party apps or services that have enabled App Intents, like Google, Etsy and Pinterest, can also appear here so you can carry out actions within this space too. For example, if you've found a bookend you like, taken a screenshot and identified it, you can shop for it on Etsy or pin it on Pinterest.\nOne aspect of this update to Visual Intelligence that gives me pause is that, for people like me who screenshot mindlessly and don't want to do anything other than get receipts, this might add a frustrating step between capturing a screenshot and saving it to Photos. It sounds like you may be able to turn off this interface and stick to the existing screenshot system, though.\nThe examples that Apple gave for Siri's ability to understand what's on your screen felt somewhat similar. In its press release from last year, Apple said \"For example, if a friend texts a user their new address in Messages, the receiver can say, 'Add this address to his contact card.'\"\nLike Visual Intelligence in screenshots, this involves scanning the onscreen content for pertinent information and helping you put it in a place (like Contacts or Calendar) where it's most useful. However, the promise of Siri's new era was more about interacting with all parts of your phone, across first- and third-party apps alike. So you could ask the assistant to open an article you added to your Reading List in Safari or send photos from a specified event to a contact.\nIt's clear Apple has yet to deliver these advancements to Siri, and like Craig Federighi said at the WWDC 2025 keynote, those might only be discussed later this year. Still, as we await that status update, the changes coming to screenshots might be a preview of things to come.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nReady for Apple's iOS 26? Here are all the compatible iPhones that can run the beta today\nAnd we've got the iPads that are confirmed to run the iPadOS 26 beta, too.\nYour iPhone and iPad's operating systems are getting big upgrades this fall with the release of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. My favorite coming to both is the visual update, called Liquid Glass \u2014 it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista. We spent two weeks test-driving it \u2014 you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 \u2014 a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall \u2014 though there are iPhone 17 rumors \u2014 we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9\u2011inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11\u2011inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (M3, M2)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later)\niPad (A16)\niPad (8th generation and later)\niPad mini (A17 Pro)\niPad mini (5th generation and later)\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September.\niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.\nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend."

      "text": "WWDC 2025: iOS 26, new Liquid Glass design and everything else Apple announced\nApple revealed a bunch of changes coming to iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year; here's what you need to know.\nApple's WWDC 2025 keynote gave fans a good look into what their iPhones, iPads and Mac computers will look like come this fall when the new software updates come out. Key to the changes is Apple's new Liquid Glass design language, which will bring UI tweaks to all of its operating systems later this year. The redesign focuses on streamlining things and boosting productivity while giving most elements a semi-translucent look. As to be expected Apple Intelligence features are baked into all of the forthcoming software updates, and users can expect to see updated widgets, a few overhauled apps and more. Here's everything Apple announced at WWDC 2025 this year.\nLiquid Glass design and new software names\nAs was expected, Apple revealed a new visual design language coming to all of its operating systems dubbed Liquid Glass. It called this new system its \"broadest\" design update yet, and it features semi-translucent features like redesigned widgets, notifications and more. Apple is billing it as more dynamic than the previous design language, and a way to bring even more consistency across all operating systems including iOS, iPadOS and macOS.\nIn addition to the redesign, Apple is revamping the names of all of its operating systems. Instead of iOS 19, for example, we\u2019ll have iOS 26 coming out this fall. iPadOS 26, watchOS 26 and others will follow suit, marking the first time Apple has given its software updates year identifiers instead of arbitrary generation numbers.\niOS 26\nThe changes coming to iOS 26 are subtle, but they give it a clean look and feel, with lots of overlapping elements, rounded corners and more. Apple said the design is inspired by visionOS, the operating system that powers Vision Pro headsets. App icons have a slightly different look, while toolbars and text inputs have see-through appearances. Folks will be happy to know that things are largely the same \u2014 you shouldn't have an issue identifying key apps like the Phone, Messages or FaceTime.\nPhone app\nSpeaking of the Phone app, it's getting the biggest redesign since its launch with the original iPhone all those years ago. It puts scrolling front and center, allowing you to scroll through key contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. A translucent bar at the bottom of the screen gives you quick access to additional contacts and the keypad. Hold Assist, a new feature, will mute hold music but keep you on a call until someone picks up on the other line.\nMessages\nMessages is getting a few new features as well, including the ability to change the entire message background color for group messages and polls among group chat members. New screening features includes \"unknown senders,\" which sequesters those pesky spam messages to a separate space in Messages, so you can keep your most important conversations in the forefront and ignore those that don't matter.\nApple Intelligence features are spread throughout all of the software updates, and in Messages, there are some related to Genmoji. In iOS 26, you'll be able to combine two existing emoji to create an entirely new, custom Genmoji, and you can even use ChatGPT to create Genmoji as well.\nLive translate is coming to Messages, too, automatically translating messages as you type and delivering them to the receiver in their preferred language. Similarly functioning live captions will be available in FaceTime, and Apple Music will get live translation and live pronunciation features to help listeners enjoy music in other languages. The Call Translation API will be available to third-party developers to use in their communication apps as well.\nMaps and Wallet\nApple Maps will gain the ability to learn your routine and suggest alternative routes based on traffic. It will also log your \"visited places\": cities, landmarks and business that you've been to, making it easier for you to find places you want to revisit again.\nSeparately, the Wallet app will support Digital ID, which lets you create a digital ID that's different from your driver's license and passport and can be used to verify your identity in some locations. You'll also be able to add updated boarding passes to Wallet when you're flying.\nGames app\niOS 26 will feature a dedicated Games app as well. It will feature a Library tab, where you can find all of the games you've ever downloaded for iOS, and a dedicated Apple Arcade tab for all of the titles included in that service. Challenges is a new feature will let you compete against friends in supported games, including supported single-player games that developers.\nVisual Intelligence\nVisual Intelligence is getting baked into iOS 26's interface a bit more, allowing you to visually search for anything that pops up on your iPhone screen. For example, if there's an image of a jacket you like on your social media feed, you can take a screenshot and use the new Visual Intelligence image search feature to search for similar jackets across the web and other apps. You can highlight certain areas of your screenshot to refine the search further.\nwatchOS 26\nIn addition to the Liquid-Glass visual overhaul, watchOS 26 will bring Workout Buddy to your wrist. The new feature will analyze your fitness history and identify insights in real time as you're working out. It takes shape as a sort of audio coach that can inform you of things like the distance you've run, average pacing and those compares to previous runs you've completed. New Apple Music integration can choose playlists for you as well, based on the type of workout you're doing.\nSmart Stack on Apple Watch is getting an update as well, prioritizing the information that matters most to you depending on your routine. For example, when you walk into your gym, a Smart Stack hint will appear on your watch that will quickly take you to the workout app so you can dive right into your training session.\nmacOS Tahoe\nThe next version of Apple's desktop operating system is dubbed macOS Tahoe, keeping the classic California naming scheme the company has been using for a long time. Liquid Glass design language is at the forefront here, but long-time Mac users will find most things look quite familiar, just with a semi-translucent, rounded edge now. Users will have the option to make custom backgrounds, change the color of their desktop folders and even add emoji to them.\niOS' Phone app will be available on macOS Tahoe, improving the calling capabilities of Mac computers. With it, you can more easily access your contacts and voicemail messages, and it will support all of the new features the new Phone app in iOS 26 will, including things like Hold Assist.\nIntelligent actions are coming to the Shortcuts app, which integrates Apple Intelligence into the existing Shortcuts program. This lets you access Apple Intelligence models on-device, creating your own Shortcuts with AI capabilities. In a similar vein, Spotlight will be more powerful in macOS Tahoe, allowing you to call upon and execute multi-step Shortcuts and actions directly from Spotlight search, without navigating to other apps. You can also use Spotlight to access your clipboard history in the latest software update, too.\niPadOS 26\niPadOS 26 will feature a Liquid Glass redesign along with most of the new features detailed for iOS 26, including the revamped Phone and Games apps. Unique for the iPad, though, is a new menu bar and windowing feature that makes the tablet's UI look and feel a lot more like macOS. That means it should improve multitasking, something iPad power-users have wanted for a long time. You can resize windows, snap them to different corners or swipe them away temporarily to get a glimpse of your home screen. Apple claims the window system is designed to work just as well with touch input (either via fingers or a stylus) or trackpads on compatible accessories.\nThe Files app on iPad will feature an updated list view and the same custom color options you'll find on the new macOS Tahoe. You'll also be able to choose which programs or apps you want to open certain files, so for example, you can opt to open an image in Photoshop rather than the default option. Speaking of, a new Preview app is coming to iPads in the new software update. A mainstay on macOS, this app will bring native PDF management, annotation and editing to Apple's tablets.\niPadOS 26 will bring a number of new features for podcasters and the like, including the ability to record \"studio quality\" vocals with AirPods. Users will also be able to press and hold their AirPods to start and stop the recordings they're making on their iPads. In addition, a new local capture feature will integrate with video conferencing apps to let users record their video on iPads for things like remote group podcasts.\nvisionOS 26\nThe next software update coming to Vision Pro systems will include new Apple Intelligence features, spatial experiences and more. Spatial widgets are coming to visionOS 26, allowing you to put, say, a calendar widget somewhere in your Vision Pro field of view and it will stay in that place even as you move around. Native and third-party apps can support spatial widgets, and they'll all be available in the new Widgets visionOS app.\nSpatial scenes is a new feature that uses AI to bring your photos to life in front of your eyes while using Vision Pro. Spatial scenes also extend to photos you'll see while browsing, so for example, those travel photos you see while researching your next vacation will look even more lifelike using spatial scenes.\nArguably the most exciting visionOS news is that it will allow the Vision Pro headset to be used with PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers. This will make Vision Pro more of a contender in the gaming space, since lack of compatible controllers was a big factor holding it back. In addition, the new software update will bring eye-scrolling to the Vision Pro, which will allow users to scroll documents, apps, webpages and more just by using their eyes.\ntvOS 26\nThe new Liquid Glass design language brings more cinematic film and TV art to the Apple TV app in tvOS 26. A new Profiles feature in Apple TV+ lets you customize your viewing experience with your own tastes, and each member of your household can have their own profile. Elsewhere, Apple Music on Apple TV is getting a karaoke-esque feature that lets you sing along to your favorite songs using your iPhone as the microphone."

      "text": "Apple's new Liquid Glass design is its biggest visual update in years\nIt's bringing the slick UI elements used in the Vision Pro to iPhones, iPads, Macs and more.\nIn addition to renaming its core operating systems, today at WWDC Apple announced a major update to the visual design of iOS, iPadOS, macOS and more. Inspired by some of the fancy graphics used in the Vision Pro, this UI overhaul not only features revamped icons and an emphasis on translucent elements, it also seeks to bring a much more unified look to Apple's flagship software platforms.\nBased on a design theme called Liquid Glass, Apple's new visual language brings increased consistency across the company's OSes. The company says the UI is informed by surrounding content and can intelligently adapt to light and dark modes while supporting sophisticated traits like real-time rendering and specular highlights.\nNavigation buttons, toolbars and controls have been redesigned to match the rounded corners of the iPhone's display and can shrink to keep relevant content front and center. Apple uses multiple layers of Liquid Glass to help people see more information at a glance without making them relearn how to use the OS.\nIn iOS 26, the home screen has been completely revamped with new app icons (including fresh all-clear options). Wallpapers and the lock screen can dynamically scale to better accommodate things like photos, album art and on-screen text. Many buttons also have a new floating design that makes them easier to see without becoming distracting or taking away from usable screen space.\nSome important apps have also gotten individual makeovers such as the Phone app, which now has a floating toolbar alongside new features such as Call Screening and Hold Assist, which are similar to the AI-powered tools available from Google's Pixel handsets.\nMeanwhile, the Camera app's interface has been significantly simplified with the ability to quickly swipe between photo and video modes. There's also a dedicated tab for your library and improved organization for other categories like albums. In iPadOS and macOS, Apple says that adaptive sidebars also makes watching shows in Apple TV more immersive.\nIn macOS 26 Tahoe, users will be able to customize the desktop and dock with updated Liquid Glass widgets and icons while new transparent menu bars are meant to make your display seem even larger than it is. You'll also have more customization options in places like the Control Center thanks to a new selection of folder colors, app icons and widgets. There's even a brand new Apple Games app, which features an overlay and the ability to quickly launch games, discover new titles and find your friends, all from a single place.\nSimilar UI updates are also heading to CarPlay and CarPlay Ultra, which is getting a matching visual refresh featuring a revamped home screen, widgets for things like Live Activities and translucent design elements. Users can set new \"tapback\" responses so you can reply to incoming messages with a single touch.\nAlternatively, if there's someone you regularly talk to while driving, you'll also be able to pin favorite conversations in CarPlay similar to how it works in Messages. And in keeping with Apple's goal of making more information available at a glance, incoming calls will no longer dominate the entire display and instead will be confined to a small window.\nAll of Apple's redesigned Liquid Glass UI elements and features are expected to be available when the next versions of iOS, macOS, iPadOS and more are officially released sometime later this year."

      "text": "macOS Tahoe 26 will bring Apple's new Liquid Glass UI to your desktop\nJust don't call it macOS 16.\nSo long macOS Sequoia, hello macOS Tahoe 26. Apple's next desktop operating system will feature the company's Liquid Glass UI, but at this point, it doesn't look like there will be any truly transformative features like last year's iPhone mirroring. But hey, at least Apple isn't trying to make us excited about widgets again. Just like the rest of Apple's new software, Tahoe's version number has also been updated to reflect the upcoming year \u2014 previously, we expected it to be macOS 16. While that may take some getting used to, it's easier than trying to remember the different version numbers across Apple's platforms.\nAt first glance, Apple's Liquid Glass refresh almost seems like a rehash of the \"Aero\" design Microsoft used in Windows Vista (which came out nearly 20 years ago, yikes). True to its name, a varying degree of transparency is key to Apple's new aesthetic \u2014 that includes a fully transparent menu bar, as well new light and dark tints for those respective display modes. Basically, it looks like macOS Tahoe will be Apple's most customizable desktop OS yet.\nAs for genuinely new features, macOS Tahoe 26 finally brings the Phone app to Apple's PCs, which also includes the new app design that's coming to iOS 26. Previously, you had to launch calls from the Messages or Facetime apps. You'll also be able to see Live Activities from your phone in the menu bar, so it'll be easier to keep track of an upcoming delivery order or Uber ride.\nApple says that macOS Tahoe 26 will also feature the biggest update ever to Spotlight, its search function. You'll be able to search across just about everything on your system \u2014 files, apps, messages \u2014 with a single query. You can also narrow your queries down in a few ways, like limiting results to PDFs. Spotlight can also search third-party cloud storage, according to Apple. It'll be interesting to see how that integration works, and if there's any noticeable lag time when it comes to searching the cloud.\nSpotlight will also have \"hundreds\" of actions built-in, so you can do something like send an email or start a podcast without jumping into multiple apps. Squint, and it looks like Spotlight could become the centerpiece of how you interact with your Mac once Apple Intelligence AI features get smarter. For power users, Apple is also introducing \"Quick Keys\": short strings of letters that can immediately launch specific functions.\nIn a demo during the WWDC keynote, an Apple representative was able to launch a document via Spotlight and then add an image just by searching through Spotlight. You'll also be able to see the history of items copied to your clipboard with Spotlight, which will surely be handy for those times where you lose track of an item you've copied.\nJust like iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26 will also feature a dedicated Games app, which will show off all the titles installed on your system. Similarly, Apple Intelligence upgrades are coming to all of Apple's platforms, including Live Translations in the Messages app, as well as new Genmoji and Image Playground features. That includes new art styles, like vector art and oil paintings.\nAs for other small updates, Safari and the Photos app are also getting redesigned with new Liquid Glass highlights. While Safari gets a more useful upgrade on iOS 26, where it can take over the entire iPhone screen, the transparent location bar could still be useful on Macs.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "How to install the iOS 26 public beta\nThis guide will also show you how to access the iPadOS 26 and (if you\u2019re brave enough) watchOS 26 betas.\nThe latest version of iOS will arrive officially this fall, but you don\u2019t need to wait to start testing the software on your iPhone, thanks to Apple\u2019s public beta rollout. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about setting up the iOS 26 beta, along with the respective betas for iPadOS 26 and watchOS 26, which Apple also revealed in its WWDC 2025 keynote.\nBefore we get started:, no, you haven\u2019t accidentally slept through eight versions of major Apple OS updates. In case you missed the news, from now on all of the company\u2019s various operating systems will be named after years to keep everything aligned and easy to follow. So rather than iOS 19, we\u2019re getting iOS 26 this year, which refers to the year after each update rolls out. Presumably that\u2019s because we\u2019ll be using it for longer in 2026 than what will remain of this year once the full version is in the wild.\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind that any beta is software in a pre-release state, meaning it's far more likely you\u2019ll encounter bugs, crashes and other issues with apps and in general use, which Apple and third-party developers will attempt to fix before the final version rolls out to users worldwide.\nInstall any beta at your own risk and think carefully before doing so with the device you use every day. It\u2019s also very important that you back up any device you want to test software on before you download it.\niOS 26 supported devices\niOS 26 is supported on a wide range of iPhones \u2014 but not all of them. You\u2019ll need one of the following models:\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\nIf your iPhone isn\u2019t listed above, that probably means it\u2019s too old to run iOS 26, so you\u2019ll need to upgrade to one of the listed models.\nHow to install the iOS 26 beta\nInstalling betas used to be a fiddly process, but it\u2019s very easy these days. If it\u2019s your first time installing an iOS public beta, you\u2019ll need to first visit the Apple Beta Software Program website and sign up using your Apple credentials.\nAfter that, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update on your compatible iPhone, and choose \u201ciOS 26 public beta\u201d. You should then see the option to download and install the beta software.\nYou can read about our first experiences with iOS 26 here.\niPadOS 26 supported devices\nHere are the supported models for the iPadOS 26 beta\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation or later)\niPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (M3)\niPad Air (M2)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later)\niPad (A16)\niPad (8th generation and later)\niPad Mini (A17 Pro)\niPad Mini (5th generation and later)\nHow to install the iPadOS 26 public beta\nLike with iOS above, you\u2019ll need to first visit the Apple Beta Software Program website and sign up using your Apple credentials if you\u2019ve never taken part in one before.\nAfter that, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update on your supported iPad, and choose \u201ciPadOS 26 public beta\u201d. You should then see the option to download and install the beta software in the Software Update screen.\nYou can read about our experiences with iPadOS 26 here.\nwatchOS beta: Use caution\nWhile Apple Watch users can also participate in beta programs in the same way as iOS and iPadOS testers, doing so carries greater risk. That\u2019s because if you\u2019re not enjoying the experience and decide you want to downgrade to watchOS 11, well, you can\u2019t. Apple doesn\u2019t allow it. And if you downgrade your watch\u2019s paired iPhone to iOS 18, your Apple Watch won\u2019t work correctly with your phone until it\u2019s back on the new software version. You can, however, leave your Apple Watch on watchOS 11 when your phone is on the iOS 26 beta.\nBe extremely sure, then, that you\u2019re comfortable with the possibility of waiting it out for a few months with an Apple Watch plagued with issues before downloading the watchOS 26 beta. For most people, it likely isn\u2019t worth the hassle.\nwatchOS 26 supported devices\nYou\u2019ll need one of these models to run the watchOS 26 beta\nApple Watch SE. (2nd generation)\nApple Watch Series 6\nApple Watch Series 7\nApple Watch Series 8\nApple Watch Series 9\nApple Watch Series 10\nApple Watch Ultra\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nHow to install the watchOS 26 public beta\nIf you've assessed the risks for your Apple Watch and still choose to install the watchOS 26 beta, you\u2019ll first need to have already updated your paired iPhone to the iOS 26 beta (see above).\nAfter that, make sure your Apple Watch is paired to your iOS 26-running iPhone and open the Watch app on your iPhone. Then, navigate to General > Software Update, and choose the watchOS 26 public beta. After doing that, you should be able to download the beta software."

      "text": "Apple Intelligence announcements at WWDC: Everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more\nIt's start of a new chapter for Apple Intelligence.\nApple Intelligence hasn't landed in the way Apple likely hoped it would, but that's not stopping the company from continuing to iterate on its suite of AI tools. During its WWDC 2025 conference on Monday, Apple announced a collection of new features for Apple Intelligence, starting with upgrades to Genmoji and Image Playground that will arrive alongside iOS 26 and the company's other updated operating systems.\nIn Messages, you'll be able to use Image Playground to generate colorful backgrounds for your group chats. At the same time, Apple has added integration with ChatGPT to the tool, meaning it can produce images in entirely new styles. As before, if you decide to use ChatGPT directly through your iPhone in this way, your information will only be shared with OpenAI if you provide permission.\nSeparately, Genmoji will allow users to combine two emoji from the Unicode library to create new characters. For example, you might merge the sloth and light bulb emoji if you want to poke fun at yourself for being slow to understand a joke.\nAcross Messages, FaceTime and its Phone app, Apple is bringing live translation to the mix. In Messages, the company's on-device AI models will translate a message into your recipient\u2019s preferred language as you type. When they responded, each message will be instantly translated into your language. In FaceTime, you'll see live captions as the person you're chatting with speaks, and over a phone call, Apple Intelligence will generate a voiced translation.\nVisual Intelligence is also in line for an upgrade. Now in addition to working with your iPhone's camera, the tool can scan what's on your screen. Like Genmoji, Visual Intelligence will also benefit from deeper integration with ChatGPT, allowing you to ask the chat bot questions about what you see. Alternatively, you can search Google, Etsy and other supported apps to find images or products that might be a visual match. And if the tool detects when you're looking at an event, iOS 26 will suggest you add a reminder to your calendar. Nifty that. If you want to access Visual Intelligence, all you need to do is press the same buttons you would to take a screenshot on your iPhone.\nAs expected, Apple is also making it possible for developers to use its on-device foundational model for their own apps. \"With the Foundation Models framework, app developers will be able to build on Apple Intelligence to bring users new experiences that are intelligent, available when they\u2019re offline, and that protect their privacy, using AI inference that is free of cost,\" the company said in its press release. Apple suggests an educational app like Kahoot! might use its on-device model to generate personalized quizzes for users. According to the company, the framework supports Swift, Apple's own coding language, and the model is as easy as writing three lines of code.\nAn upgraded Shortcuts app for both iOS and macOS is also on the way, with support for actions powered by Apple Intelligence. You'll be able to tap into either of the company's on-device or Private Cloud Compute model to generate responses that are part of whatever shortcut you want carried out. Apple suggests students might use this feature to create a shortcut that compares an audio transcript of a class lecture to notes they wrote on their own. Here again users can turn to ChatGPT if they want.\nThere are many other smaller enhancements enabled by upgrades Apple has made to its AI suite. Most notably, Apple Wallet will automatically summarize tracking details merchants and delivery carriers send to you so you can find them in one place.\nA year since its debut at WWDC 2024, it's safe to say Apple Intelligence has failed to meet expectations. The smarter, more personal Siri that was the highlight of last year's presentation has yet to materialize. In fact, the company delayed the upgraded digital assistant in March, only saying at the time that it would arrive sometime in the coming year. Other parts of the suite may have shipped on time, but often didn't show the company's usual level of polish. For instance, notification summaries were quite buggy at launch, and Apple ended up reworking the messages to make it clearer they were generated by Apple Intelligence. With today's announcements, Apple still has a long way to go before it catches up to competitors like Google, but at least the company kept the focus on practical features.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "macOS 26 beta preview: Spotlight's time to shine\nApple's Liquid Glass refresh looks good, but the Spotlight is the big draw.\nI've learned not to expect much from macOS updates \u2014 not through sheer cynicism, but from the obvious reality that Apple pays far more attention to iOS and iPadOS than its desktop platform. I get it. macOS is a thing of the past, while smartphones and tablets are Apple's profitable present and future. But still, I think Mac users deserve more than just widgets, or the ability to merely mirror their iPhones (a feature that's not only genuinely useful, but also cements how crucial iPhones are to Apple and its users today). Now with macOS 26, Apple is finally showing a bit more love to its laptops and desktops.\nAfter testing the macOS Tahoe 26 developer beta for a few weeks, it definitely feels like a more substantial update than the last few versions. The revamped Spotlight alone will likely delight Mac diehards, since it makes it easier to find apps and perform all manner of tasks without requiring your fingers leave the keyboard. Add in a lovely visual refresh thanks to Apple's Liquid Glass design, as well as enhanced iPhone continuity features, and you have an operating system that feels like a genuine step forward for the Mac faithful.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nSpotlight becomes more than a search engine\nI've never been a heavy Spotlight user, aside from the few times I've needed to quickly look for an app or file. But in macOS Tahoe 26, it's suddenly a lot more useful. Now Spotlight can also help you find specific files; search cloud file services and websites; run Apple shortcuts and automations; and even run basic commands, like looking up your recent screenshots when you type \"/screenshot.\" Spotlight has become more than just a search engine for your Mac, it's practically a super-powered command line. (And notably, it has no real equivalent on Windows. So once again, Mac power users will be able to gloat about the supremacy of macOS.)\nOver the course of my testing, tapping the command key and space bar to trigger Spotlight practically became second nature. I'd bring it up to find files, as usual, but I noticed that it was better at unearthing what I was looking for than before. Spotlight also replaced my usual practice of typing in search strings in Safari or Chrome's address bar. It takes just a few seconds to bring up Spotlight, type \"YouTube,\" hit tab to trigger the search box and type in the video I'm looking for. This intelligent site searching also works for Amazon and IMDB \u2014 hopefully, Apple will add more commonly used sites over time (or perhaps just the ability to map a site's internal search engine to Spotlight).\nIf you're often buried by tons of tabs in your web browser, Spotlight can also quickly search through them. That helped me avoid getting distracted by social media and Slack conversations. I could just stay in my productivity flow, since I didn't have to sift through multiple app windows and tabs. The ability to trigger actions from Spotlight was similarly useful \u2014 it's a cinch to pop it up, start typing \"Send Message\" and jot out a quick text to my wife. Spotlight also learns your most common commands over time, so now I just have to type \"se\" for the Send Message action to pop up.\nI'm sure for a certain type of Mac power user, Spotlight will give them far fewer reasons to ever touch their mouse or trackpad.\nA more refined user interface with Liquid Glass\nWhile Spotlight is the most powerful upgrade in macOS Tahoe 26, you'll notice the spiffier Liquid Glass interface first. As with iOS 26, it basically amounts to more transparencies and visual flourishes spread throughout the OS. The menu bar at the top of the screen is now fully transparent, instead of looking foggy like before. It's not much, but it does make your Mac's screen seem a little bigger (or perhaps that may have just been extra noticeable on the cramped 13-inch MacBook Air I've been testing on).\nSimilarly, widgets and the Control Center dropdown have more glass-like visual elements that make them look a bit more modern. There's no real practical advantage, but to paraphrase a classic Marge Simpson quote, I just think it's neat. Apple Silicon-equipped hardware has more than enough graphics power to spare, so these visual upgrades also don't hinder performance at all. I didn't notice any slowdown during my testing, and according to Activity Monitor, there didn't seem to be a big hit to CPU or GPU usage.\nBetter iPhone integration\nEven though you've been able to make phone calls on Macs for a while now through FaceTime, it's taken until macOS Tahoe 26 for Apple to debut a dedicated Phone app. The app itself is nothing special \u2014 it gives you a quick glance at your contacts and recent calls, all in a compact Liquid Glass window \u2014 but at least it's a more logical place for phone calls.\nEven better than the standalone app, though, is the addition of iPhone Live Activities appearing in the macOS Tahoe 26 menu bar. That makes it easier to keep track of an inbound Uber or Doordash order, without whipping out your phone. And if you need to tap into a specific activity, macOS will also automatically launch the app from your phone via iPhone mirroring. It's the sort of usability feature you'd expect from Apple, and notably it's also not easily replicable on Windows. (And sure, you can also view it as a way to keep iPhone users from straying to the dark side too.)\nOther useful upgrades\nThe more I dug into macOS Tahoe 26, the more intriguing it became. Here are a few other updates worth highlighting:\nThe Shortcuts app seems a lot more powerful now, especially with the addition of custom automations and Apple Intelligence-powered actions. You can have an automation trigger writing tools or Image Playgrounds, and there's also a new \"Use Model\" command that can tap into on-device AI models and ChatGPT. I'm still trying to wrap my head around building a complex automation, but conceivably it could let you do something like compare an audio transcript to text notes, according to Apple.\nSafari has received a Liquid Glass redesign that looks pretty polished. It's not nearly as transformative as the Safari iOS upgrade, which makes it easier to read websites on a small phone screen, but at least it looks nice.\nThe Notes app now has Apple Intelligence-powered reminders whenever you share content to it. That could help you unearth some key tasks from a large email.\nThe Photos app has also received the Liquid Glass treatment, and you can finally use Pinned Collections on Macs to keep your favorite photo groups handy.\nThe Apple Music app can now use AutoMix to intelligently blend songs together, similar to a DJ. I've been using this feature on iOS 26 a lot, and it's honestly delightful \u2014 so long as you're not a total gapless playback purist."

      "text": "Apple reportedly has a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT in the works\nBloomberg reports that Apple has a dedicated team to create an in-house chatbot and search experience.\nApple has fallen far behind in the competitive market of AI-powered chatbots, but it may have a plan for an in-house option that aligns with the company's \"not first, but best\" philosophy. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple created a team called \"Answers, Knowledge and Information\" earlier this year that's tasked with developing a \"stripped-down rival to ChatGPT.\"\nForming this team represents a major change in direction from Apple's earlier stance on artificial intelligence when the company partnered with OpenAI in 2024 to infuse Siri with ChatGPT instead of developing its own AI chatbot. Now, Gurman reported that this new Apple team will instead develop in-house AI services for a \"new ChatGPT-like search experience\" that can crawl the web to respond to questions. These new capabilities could be a standalone app, as well as support AI capabilities for Apple's Siri, Spotlight and Safari, according to Gurman's sources. The team is reportedly led by Robby Walker, who previously oversaw Siri, and has been advertising job openings that mention wanting experience with search algorithms and engine development.\nBeyond the Answers, Knowledge and Information team, Apple has experienced some growing pains when it comes to artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, the company said it would delay the release of the new-and-improved Siri, adding only that it would roll out \"in the coming year.\" However, Apple is aware of the need to accelerate its Apple Intelligence program to stay competitive. In the latest third-quarter earnings call, the company's CEO Tim Cook said that Apple is open to acquisitions to fast-track its AI roadmap."

      "text": "Apple read your mean tweets about Liquid Glass and Finder\nThe second developer betas changed the look of Liquid Glass and Finder.\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same. After unveiling some new visual elements to the next generation of its operating systems during WWDC 2025, Apple has already walked back some of the proposed design revisions. 9to5Mac noticed that the most recent developer betas included changes to the new Liquid Glass operating system appearance and to the Finder app icon.\nLiquid Glass was divisive from the start. The idea of layering transparency in the user interface appealed to some, while others felt it was needlessly fussy and hard to read, especially when using the Control Center. In the second developer beta of iOS 26, Apple has increased the darkness and blur on the background when the Control Center is active.\nThe other controversial change centered on the imagery for the Finder app in macOS Tahoe. The previous developer beta flipped the colors in the icon, putting blue on the right and white on the left. It's a reversal of decades of Mac design, which has long had a lighter shade on the right and a darker color on the left, even as other details of the face illustration have changed. And people were not pleased about it. The usual color layout has returned in the current developer beta."

      "text": "iPhone 17 release is rumored for September: Everything you need to know about the 'thinnest iPhone ever' and the Apple fall event\nHere are all the iPhone 17 rumors and leaks leading up to the fall announcement.\nThe closer we get to Apple's reveal of the iPhone 17 lineup, the more excited we are to see what's different from the previous iPhones. The newest smartphones will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features. Since we still have to wait at least a month (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nWill the iPhone 17 Pro have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design? That's the implication from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker.\" The individual posted a render on X today (see below) that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump.\nAgain, this is a render, not a real-world photo, and \u2014 like all such stories ahead of the official announcement \u2014 should be treated with the usual grain of salt. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?\nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 \u2014 but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick \u2014 half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.\nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.\nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 \u2014 likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson \u2014 a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information \u2014 showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups \u2014 not real, leaked iPhones \u2014 it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm.\nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story."

      "text": "Apple reported huge quarterly earnings yesterday, and on the call with investors, CEO Tim Cook gave an update on how popular iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe are proving thus far.\nApple\u2019s three flagship OS updates are proving extremely popular in beta\nWhatever your opinion of the new Liquid Glass design coming in iOS 26 and Apple\u2019s other updates, there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s sparked a lot of interest.\nAs compelling as new features might be for your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, there\u2019s nothing like a fresh design to spur upgrades.\nAnd according to CEO Tim Cook, Apple has seen that prove out in the beta process so far.\nPer Jason Snell\u2019s transcript at Six Colors, here\u2019s what Cook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call:\niOS 26, macOS 26, and iPadOS 26 are by far the most popular developer betas we\u2019ve had.\nThis isn\u2019t altogether surprising. But it is noteworthy nonetheless.\nIt\u2019s interesting that Cook called out not only iOS 26, but also macOS Tahoe and iPadOS 26 as being the most popular beta releases ever.\nFor iPadOS 26, that makes a lot of sense, since many iPad users were clearly eager to start using the release\u2019s many productivity upgrades.\nDevelopers tend to not be so quick to adopt macOS betas, however. But it seems Liquid Glass, or at least the desire to check compatibility of apps with the new update, spurred faster macOS Tahoe upgrades than usual.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Apple\u2019s developer program used to require a $99/year fee for access to developer betas, and that\u2019s no longer been the case the last few years.\nBut it seems a pretty safe bet that the trend of more popular developer betas extends to the public beta releases too. Again, there\u2019s nothing like a new design to drive users to upgrade.\nHave you noticed more friends and family members expressing interest in the iOS 26 betas this year?

      "text": "If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission. Pricing and availability are subject to change.\nHow to customize your iPhone's lock screen on iOS 26\nHere's how to make your lock screen more aesthetically appealing while keeping you productive.\nIf you're giving the iOS 26 beta a test run or just want to know how different it is, chances are you're customizing your iPhone to your liking. (As a reminder, these iPhones can download the iOS 26 beta now, or you can wait until the initial version is released, likely in September.) That includes personalizing your lock screen, because let's be honest, you probably look at it a lot. Don't worry, I'm in the same boat. This week I'm already averaging 55 pickups per day \u2014 checking notifications and the time really adds up!\nSince you have to see your lock screen to open your phone, you might as well make it as useful as possible \u2014 and potentially eliminate the need to actually unlock your phone. From adding helpful widgets (think: checking the weather) to swapping in your most-used apps as your quick control buttons, you can actually make your phone time more productive. It's pretty simple to do on the latest operating system, so we'll walk you through it.\nRead on to see how you'll customize your lock screen in iOS 26.\nHow different is the new iOS 26 lock screen\nWith Apple's upcoming OS, you've got several new options when it comes to changing the appearance of your lock screen. Apple mostly kept the structure the same as iOS 18, so the new changes aren't hard to find.\nHere's what's noticeably different: there's more depth and a glassy finish to the bottom buttons, as opposed to iOS 18 where the icon background is grey. Speaking of glassy finish, when customizing the clock, there's a new Glass option to give it the Liquid Glass aesthetic \u2014 the glass appearance can only be applied to the clock on the lock screen.\nAdditionally, when you swipe up to your Notification Center, you'll notice that instead of the original grey background of your notifications, it's now clear. The same goes for swiping down to the Control Center. That's because the glass effect has been added here, too. If you don't like how clear the background is, you can go to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size and then toggle on Reduce Transparency. This will apply to your notifications and other drop-down screens.\nNow, let's get into personalizing your lock screen.\nHow to start customizing your iPhone's lock screen\nJust like the current iOS, you can change the appearance by pressing and holding the lock screen. Doing this will open the collections of lock screens you've created, where you can choose to customize the current screen or create a new one. For now, tap the Customize button.\nChoose your wallpaper\nFirst things first \u2014 and arguably the most fun part of this process \u2014 select a photo to set the tone on your iPhone. Whether that's a personal photo of your child, significant other, a pet or one of the iPhone stock options is up to you. If you don't want to use a personal photo, the live weather wallpaper is pretty cool \u2014 if it's cloudy, your background will be cloudy; if it's sunny, well, you get the idea. This option is under the Weather & Astronomy category when choosing a wallpaper \u2014 you may have to scroll down to see it but on my phone, it's located under the Featured section.\nCan't decide on just one? You can set up a photo shuffle to rotate throughout the day.\nAnd if you don't want your wallpaper covered by the clock, you can turn on Depth Effect which layers the time behind the most important parts of your picture. For instance, my toddler's head is displayed in front of the clock but it doesn't interfere with seeing what time it is. To turn it on, just tap the three dots menu on the lower right and then select Depth Effect. Alternatively, do the same to turn it off.\nMake your clock bigger and glassy\nHere's one that's 100% new to iOS 26: you can make the clock even larger on your lock screen. That's right, no more squinting to see what time it is. While in editing mode, tap on the lower right corner of the clock (you'll see a little notch) and drag it down. At its largest, it takes up nearly half the screen.\nAlso new to the clock, as I mentioned earlier, is the ability to give it a glassy finish. Just tap on the time while editing and you'll see the option at the bottom for Glass or Solid. In this setting, you can also change the font, boldness and color.\nChange your Quick Controls\nThe choices here really aren't much different from iOS 18 \u2014 you still have the option to swap out the quick controls at the bottom. If you haven't changed them, you likely still have the flashlight and camera buttons. To update them, tap the minus symbol and then tap the plus sign. The idea is to add an app or function you use regularly, like Visual Intelligence/Siri, Snapchat or Calculator. Not all apps are options here, but you can use the Shortcuts button to add other apps like Amazon or Starbucks.\nIdeally, doing this will save you time from scrolling through pages of apps to find what you're looking for \u2014 or from forgetting what you were doing and clicking on a completely different app.\nAdd widgets\nBelow the clock, you can add widgets to your screen so you can take a quick peek at things like the weather or calendar events without opening the apps. All you have to do is tap the box and then drag and drop (or just tap) the widget you want to add.\nThe newest addition added to widgets in iOS 26 is the Shortcuts app. You can choose from any shortcuts you've already created and apply them to your screen.\nConnect your lock screen to Focus Mode\nSince we're talking about keeping our screen time productive, one of the best ways to do so is by enabling Focus Mode. When you connect this feature to your lock screen, it can change the widgets that appear and your notifications. The options in iOS 26 are Do Not Disturb, Reduce Interruptions (new), Work, Personal and Sleep.\nTo turn it on, long press the lock screen and the Focus button should appear. You can then make your selection for which type of focus you need: Personal, work, etc. If you don't yet have them set up, click Focus Settings at the bottom to get started.\nYou can set up a schedule for when your focus time should start and end, and you can also silence chatty people and apps that are constantly dinging your phone. You'll also select the lock screen that'll turn on when it's time to focus.\nWhen you're finished customizing your lock screen, make sure to select Done in the top right corner so your changes are saved. You'll also be asked whether you want to save the image to your home screen as well or if you want to customize it instead. I like to use different photos, but that's up to you.\nHow to create multiple lock screens in iOS 26\nReady for a new lock screen but would still like to keep your current one? Just press and hold the lock screen until you see the carousel again. From here, you can either swipe right or tap the plus sign button at the bottom right. When the screen opens, you'll see the Photos icon at the top left. Click that and scroll through your photos until you find the one you want to use. Once you make a selection, you'll be taken back to the lock screen to finish customizing.\nYou can crop the image so it fits better \u2014 it's usually awkwardly zoomed in. Once you do get it adjusted, do not touch that hexagon icon! It will zoom back in and mess up any cropping you did.\nWhen you're satisfied with your lock screen, tap Add in the top right corner. You can then choose whether to add the same photo to your home screen or to customize it.\nThat's it! You now have a lock screen that's unique to you \u2014 and hopefully a bit more useful."

      "text": "iOS 26 is official: Apple changes from version numbers to years for its OS names\nStarting next year they'll be iOS 26, iPadOS 26, MacOS 26, WatchOS 26, TVOS 26 and VisionOS 26.\nAs part of an overhaul to its operating systems, Apple is making one of the most significant changes ever to its OS branding, the company announced at its WWDC 25 developer's conference. Starting in 2026, it will shift from the current version numbers (macOS 15, iOS 18, iPadOS 18.5, etc.) to a year-based system across its entire OS lineup. As such, the names will change to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, MacOS Tahoe 26, WatchOS 26, TVOS 26 and VisionOS 26 and follow that pattern going forward.\nTo explain the new system, software SVP Craig Federighi said tongue-in-cheek that the company's crack marketing team noticed that years end with two digits, so why not go with that? However, future Mac operating systems will retain their California nature theme names like Tahoe (the new version of macOS) and the current Sequoia, on top of the new numbering scheme. That's because \"macOS demands more\" than just two-digit year names, Federighi explained.\nThe year-oriented change is understandable \u2014 keeping track of Apple's latest updates was getting to be a chore for users given the number of unique operating systems. With the addition of the Vision Pro extended reality headset, the company now counts six OS families with four unique numbering schemes.\nApple's iPhones will retain the current numbering system, however. Recall that Samsung switched to a year-based Galaxy S phone naming system in 2020 after the Galaxy S10, with the current model being the Galaxy S25. That doesn't seem to be in the cards (yet) for Apple.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "iOS 26 updates for AirPods preview: Enhanced audio recording, camera remote and more\nHands-on with the new features for Apple\u2019s earbuds that are coming with iOS 26.\nOf all the new iOS 26 features that Apple previewed at WWDC in June, AirPods updates were only briefly mentioned. Studio-quality audio recording and improved call clarity got top billing, while the addition of a camera remote control was also quickly discussed. However, when the beta software arrived last week, it turned out there were actually more features than described at the event, making this a meatier update for Apple\u2019s recent AirPods than initially indicated. I\u2019ve spent some time testing all of the new tools, so here\u2019s what you can expect when you decide to use them.\nHow to get the latest AirPods features\nAll of these updates are available for AirPods that have the H2 chip. Those include AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with ANC and AirPods Pro 2. You\u2019ll have to download the public betas of both iOS 26 and the latest AirPods firmware to use these features. If you\u2019re not feeling adventurous, all of these items will arrive this fall when the final versions of Apple\u2019s OS updates roll out. That\u2019s likely to happen for iOS and AirPods in early September, around the time the new crop of iPhones debuts.\nStudio-quality audio recording\nApple may have framed the voice quality improvements on its AirPods as a boost for creators, but I\u2019d argue the upgrade will be a welcome change for all. Sure, people who create content will benefit considerably from what Apple calls \u201cstudio-quality audio recording,\u201d but the improved performance in noisy environments is something anyone will appreciate.\nThe company hasn\u2019t offered much detail on exactly what it did to produce higher-quality audio, only describing the change in an initial press release as the result of a mix of the AirPods\u2019 H2 chip, beamforming microphones and computational audio. That last update is likely doing the heavy lifting here, assisted by Apple\u2019s audio chip, of course. I asked Apple for more specifics, but have yet to hear back.\nImproved audio recording is available across iPhones, iPads and Macs, working in apps like Camera, Voice Memos, Messages (for dictation), Webex and more. Apple also says there\u2019s upgraded vocal sound quality for calls, offering \u201cmore natural vocal texture and clarity\u201d for Phone, FaceTime and other CallKit-enabled apps. As the voice upgrades are the most notable new features, I was eager to test them, and have spent the last several weeks doing just that (via the developer beta).\nIf you\u2019re recording in a quiet room, you\u2019ll notice that enhanced texture and clarity Apple promised. In my samples captured in Voice Memos, there\u2019s not a huge difference between new and old firmware, but there is a noticeable one. The bigger improvement came when I moved to a noisy spot. Here, Apple dialed back its noise suppression in favor of voice clarity. While you\u2019ll hear the slight roar of background noise in my audio clip, I actually sound better overall. That\u2019s a trade I\u2019ll bet many users will gladly make over the highly processed, digital-sounding results AirPods used to give us in less-than-ideal surroundings.\nI also noticed that both of my samples with the new software were captured with a 48kHz sample rate. This isn\u2019t new for AirPods audio recording/quality per se, but before this update some of my clips were still 24kHz \u2014 like my noisy sample with the old firmware. It seems like Apple is now defaulting to 48kHz as part of the overall sound boost, but that\u2019s currently unclear and is something else I\u2019ve asked the company for more info about.\nCamera remote\nThe less exciting, but equally handy update for AirPods that Apple announced at WWDC is the addition of a camera remote control. Since newer AirPods have either force sensors or touch controls on their stems, the company saw fit to let you use those to take a photo or start and stop video recording. All of these tasks are done with either one press or a press and hold (you select which one you prefer when you enable the camera remote function).\nFor photos, you get a three-second countdown before your device snaps the picture. This gives you ample time to put your hand down after pressing the AirPods stem so you don\u2019t ruin the selfie. For video, there\u2019s no countdown, but there is a second or two delay before the recording starts. So, if you\u2019re quick about it, you can get your hand away from your ear before showtime. However, you\u2019ll still have to reach for an AirPod or your phone when the time comes to stop recording, so there will be some editing to do there. This all works well, but just remember you have to enable the camera remote feature as it\u2019s not activated by default after the firmware update.\nSleep pausing and CarPlay switching\nMost AirPods users have probably fallen asleep with one or both of the earbuds in their ears. Apple\u2019s update will add automatic pausing when you\u2019ve dozed off to help you not miss much of your TV show or podcast you were watching or listening to. However, it\u2019s unclear how this works. All we know is it\u2019s a simple on-or-off switch, and it\u2019s disabled by default. Some have speculated that it uses sleep data from the Apple Watch, but that hasn\u2019t been confirmed. Since AirPods have accelerometers, it\u2019s possible the feature may rely on detecting movement, but I\u2019ve asked for a firm answer on what\u2019s going on here.\nAnother item on the list of AirPods updates is automatic switching for CarPlay. This is supposed to seamlessly transfer the audio to your car\u2019s infotainment system from the earbuds when your phone connects to your vehicle. Again, there hasn\u2019t been much discussion of this, and my attempts to trigger it were unsuccessful. That may be due to the fact that it requires wireless CarPlay, but I\u2019m not seeing specific options for this in my AirPods settings. I\u2019m waiting for more info from Apple on this feature too, and hopefully I\u2019ll have more details to add to my observations soon."
