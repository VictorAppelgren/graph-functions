  "content": "Costco Wholesale Corp. will forgo dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone, citing low customer interest, in a victory for pro-life organizations seeking to pull the drugs from pharmaceutical shelves.\n\n\u201cOur position at this time not to sell mifepristone, which has not changed, is based on the lack of demand from our members and other patients, who we understand generally have the drug dispensed by their medical providers,\u201d said the company in a Thursday statement to media outlets, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe decision by the nation\u2019s third-largest retailer to stop mifepristone sales at its 500-plus pharmacies comes amid a pitched battle over the drug\u2019s access between abortion foes and pro-choice advocates led by New York City Comptroller Brad Lander.\n\nThe Democrat Mr. Lander said Thursday that \u201cCostco\u2019s refusal to dispense mifepristone is disappointing and short-sighted.\u201d\n\n\u201cFailure to provide access to safe, FDA-approved medication under the guise of \u2018weak demand\u2019 risks isolating customers and undermines the company\u2019s credibility,\u201d said Mr. Lander on X.\n\nThose cheering Costco\u2019s announcement included the Alliance Defending Freedom, part of a coalition led by Inspire Investing that has pushed U.S. pharmacy chains to forego seeking Food and Drug Administration certification to dispense mifepristone.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Costco for doing the right thing by its shareholders and resisting activist calls to sell abortion drugs,\u201d said ADF legal counsel Michael Ross in a statement. \u201cRetailers like Costco keep their doors open by selling a lifetime of purchases to families, both large and small. They have nothing to gain and much to lose by becoming abortion dispensaries.\u201d\n\nSusan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said on X that \u201cCostco is standing up for women & unborn children by refusing to sell mifepristone.\u201d\n\nThe free-market State Financial Officers Foundation called the decision \u201ca win for responsible corporate governance.\u201d\n\nLast year, Mr. Lander urged Costco and others to follow the example of CVS and Walgreens by taking \u201cthe necessary steps to receive certification to dispense the medication mifepristone in states where it is legal.\u201d\n\nHe said making mifepristone available at the pharmacies would increase sales and generate \u201clong-term shareholder value,\u201d while the foundation called his actions \u201cclear attempts to politicize Costco\u2019s business without regard for the company\u2019s well-being.\u201d\n\nInspire Investing said in March that Walmart and Kroger are not filling prescriptions for abortion pills, citing its communications with the firms.\n\nThe FDA has loosened restrictions on mifepristone since approving the drug for abortion use in 2000, raising concerns about increasing safety risks to pregnant women in the name of expanding access.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, the FDA dropped its in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone and allowed certified pharmacies to fill prescriptions for the drug.\n\nMifepristone, used in conjunction with the drug misoprostol, is FDA-approved to end pregnancies up to 10 weeks\u2019 gestation.\n\nAbout two-thirds of U.S. abortions are accomplished using the abortion-pill method, according to the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute.",

      "text": "Inspire has been actively engaging some of the world\u2019s largest companies, making significant progress on issues of abortion, censorship and religious liberty, de-banking, Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), corporate charitable giving, DEI, and LGBT Activism.\nThe central theme that runs through Inspire\u2019s shareholder advocacy work is to get companies to focus on their core products and services and stay out of divisive political issues that could expose them to customer and employee backlash and legal risk.\nAbortion is a critical issue of our time and Inspire Investing has been working tirelessly to protect life. With over 60% of all abortions in the US being procured through the abortion pill, we have been leading the charge to keep some of the biggest pharmacies in the country like Costco, Walmart, Kroger, Albertson\u2019s, and McKesson from selling the drug mifepristone.\nRoe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. In response, in 2023, the Biden Administration\u2019s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed the in-person dispensing requirements for mifepristone and allowed pharmacies to dispense the drug to anyone with a prescription even though the FDA\u2019s own label on the drug indicates that hospitalizations increase 300% with no in\u2010person doctor visit and roughly 1 in 25 women who take the drug will end up in the emergency room. In early 2024, CVS and Walgreens made public statements that they had started to dispense the pill while other retailers indicated they were still deciding. In June 2024, the Supreme Court made a ruling (FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine) temporarily allowing pharmacies to continue to dispense the drug, but the Court decided the case on procedural grounds and left unresolved whether the current system of dispensing and distributing the drug is legal. For example, the Comstock Act prohibits dispensing or distributing the drug by mail and the Trump administration is likely to enforce this. After the ruling, in July, the NYC Comptroller started pressuring major pharmacies to sell the pill. In October 2024, Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador joined AGs in Missouri and Kansas in suing the FDA over their illegal efforts to dangerously expand access to mifepristone. In January 2025, the judge ruled that the case can continue.\nInspire\u2019s work on mifepristone initially focused on Costco. We reached out last spring asking the company to clarify its plans to sell the abortion pill. The company confirmed that they had \u201cyet to see any material demand for mifepristone from our members,\u201d but they still said they were evaluating whether to become certified. After not receiving a definitive response, we mobilized over 9,000 investors, members, and concerned citizens to sign a petition to Costco\u2019s CEO asking him to consider the legal, moral, economic, and political controversy surrounding the dispensing of mifepristone.\nAfter the NYC Comptroller sent letters in July to Costco, Walmart, Albertson\u2019s, Kroger and McKesson, our engagement on the issue expanded beyond Costco. Inspire worked with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) to mobilize a coalition of asset managers and financial professionals representing over $100 billion in assets to send a response which was widely covered in the media. We also initiated a calling and email campaign to the companies, focused primarily on Costco. Our friends at The Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC) joined us in our efforts with their own email campaign to Costco, whiles other organizations like Live Action, Right to Life Idaho, and Idaho Family Policy Center helped spread the word. In addition, fourteen state treasurers also joined Inspire\u2019s efforts by sending their own letters, emphasizing the risks of entering this controversial business.\nAlthough our work certainly made waves and mobilized thousands of concerned citizens, the responses from the companies were far from adequate. The companies either didn\u2019t respond, said they were still researching the issue, or, in the case of Kroger, seemed to indicate they were moving forward with becoming certified. As a result, we filed shareholder resolutions at Walmart, Kroger, and McKesson, and plan to file at Costco as well.\nIn January 2025, Inspire met with executives at Walmart. We started the meeting by thanking the company for de-politicizing its business by rolling back its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs which was the main request of another letter we sent to the company in 2024. Regarding abortion, we received verbal confirmation that Walmart is not selling the abortion drug and has no current plans to become certified. While we expressed appreciation and commended the company for taking this stance, we have asked Walmart to make a public statement to this effect. We also talked to the company about whether abortion would be covered in its health travel benefit plan and are awaiting clarification. Given that Walmart is the largest employer in the US, we are hopeful that these decisions on DEI and abortion will be a catalyst for other companies to make the right decision and not needlessly insert themselves into thorny political issues that are better left for the ballot box.\nIn December 2024, Inspire filed a shareholder resolution at Kroger asking for a report on the risks to the company from selling mifepristone. We filed the resolution because their August 2024 response letter to us strongly indicated that the company was planning to move forward with becoming certified. At the time, we expressed our disappointment at their decision. In February 2025, similar to Walmart, the company informed us that it is not selling the drug in its pharmacies. We thanked the company for taking a stance on an issue that is fraught with financial, legal, and moral risk, and asked for commitment to not proceed with plans to become certified. We are awaiting clarification from the company.\nYour investments have power. At Inspire Investing, we are using that power to advocate for life\u2014and we invite you to join us.\nOur engagement with Walmart and Kroger has made real progress in urging them to avoid selling the abortion pill mifepristone, but there\u2019s still more work to do. Corporate America needs to hear from investors who stand for life.\nWhen you invest with Inspire, you become part of a movement that uses shareholder influence to uphold biblical values and protect the unborn.
