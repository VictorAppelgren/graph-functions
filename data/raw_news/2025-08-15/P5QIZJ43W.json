  "description": "The lawsuit over a business dispute between the members of the legendary rock duo Hall & Oates ended Aug. 12.",
  "content": "The band may not be back together, but Daryl Hall and John Oates at least aren't in a court battle anymore.\n\nThe lawsuit over a business dispute between the members of the legendary rock duo Hall & Oates ended Aug. 12, court documents show. Hall, who filed the lawsuit against Oates, his wife and a member of Oates' trust in November 2023, dismissed his claims in Davidson County Chancery Court on Aug. 11.\n\nThe lawsuit concerned what Hall said was Oates' plan to sell a portion of their joint venture Whole Oats Enterprises to a third party. Hall argued that sale would violate a business agreement the two musicians reached on Oct. 15, 2021. Hall sued Oates as well as his wife, Aimee Oates, and Richard Flynn, who are both co-trustees of The John W. Oates TISA Trust and were parties to the October 2021 agreement.\n\nThe claims were resolved in arbitration outside court, so it's not clear in court filings if the sale went through. A possible clue could lie in how the case was legally dismissed from court.\n\nAt Hall's request, the case was dismissed without prejudice. That's legalese meaning Hall could refile a lawsuit over the same issue later, compared with a dismissal with prejudice, which would end the issue once and for all.\n\nThe sale of Whole Oats Enterprises to publisher Primary Wave Music was temporarily blocked by Chancellor Russell Perkins in late November 2023 until an arbitrator had a chance to weigh in.\n\nAttorneys for Hall or Oates and the other defendants did not respond to emails sent prior to publication. The musicians' publicists also did not return requests for comment.\n\nThe duo, known for hits like \"Maneater,\" \"Rich Girl\" and \"Out of Touch,\" is likely never reuniting, based on Oates' statements to Rolling Stone for a 2024 article.\n\nIn the early days of the lawsuit, the two lashed out in court filings. Hall called Oates' actions \"the ultimate partnership betrayal.\" Oates retorted that Hall's accusations were \"inflammatory, outlandish and inaccurate.\"\n\nMore: The Daryl Hall and John Oates legal battle explained\n\nHave questions about the justice system?

      "text": "Hall & Oates lawsuit: Judge sides with Daryl Hall, blocks John Oates' attempt to sell\nAfter an attorney for one half of musical duo Hall & Oates read a draft order to block his client\u2019s sale of shares in a joint venture Thursday morning, he had a simple message for the judge: I can\u2019t go for that.\nBut Chancellor Russell T. Perkins\u2019 order filed Thursday afternoon is pretty clear.\nNo can do.\nIn at least a short-term win for musician Daryl Hall, Perkins entered a temporary injunction Thursday that means musician John Oates still cannot sell his shares of Whole Oats Enterprises, the joint business venture between Hall and Oates, to third party publisher Primary Wave Music.\nThe injunction blocks the sale until a private arbitrator hired to weigh in on the dispute decides whether a restraining order in the arbitration is appropriate, or until Feb. 17, 2024, at 1 p.m., whichever comes first. Perkins called the injunction he entered \"provisional,\" as it's meant to maintain the status quo until an arbitrator has a chance to rule.\nHall, who filed a lawsuit against his longtime musical partner in Davidson Chancery Court on Nov. 16, says in court records that Oates attempted to make the sale to the publisher without his approval, in violation of a business agreement between the two.\nFor those out of touch: The Daryl Hall and John Oates legal battle explained ahead of Nashville court date\nHall says he learned of Oates\u2019 plan to sell his shares of Whole Oats on Oct. 20, just days before Hall was scheduled to embark on an international tour.\n\u201cI was blindsided by this information,\u201d Hall wrote.\nIf the sale had gone through, Hall says he would've been \"forced to partner with an entity that I did not agree to partner with, and whose business model does not comport with my views,\" writing that \"there is no amount of money that could compensate\" him for that.\nHall contacted an arbitration company on Nov. 9 to resolve the dispute, his attorneys say, but by Nov. 16, still no arbitrator had been selected. Hall said he feared that Oates would make the sale as soon as Nov. 20, so he sued. Perkins issued a temporary restraining order on Nov. 16 blocking the sale for 15 days.\nA briefing in the lawsuit from Wednesday night says that the parties finally selected an arbitrator on Monday.\nThe two traded blows in personal declarations filed in the court case on Wednesday, with Hall calling Oates' alleged actions the \"ultimate partnership betrayal.\"\nOates, on the other hand, has called Hall's claims \"inflammatory, outlandish and inaccurate,\" and contends that he did nothing wrong in trying to sell his shares to Primary Wave. His attorney Tim Warnock from Nashville firm Loeb & Loeb said Thursday morning that Oates proceeded \u201cexactly as he was allowed to proceed,\u201d which drew a head shake from Christine Lepera, the New York lawyer on Hall\u2019s legal team who was in Nashville for the hearing.\nWho is right is still a mystery to the public at this point, since many of the documents in the case have been placed under seal. Perkins ruled from the bench Thursday morning that the seal will stay in place, meaning the details of the duo\u2019s business dealings remain for private eyes.\nMore: 'Outlandish and inaccurate': John Oates lashes back at Daryl Hall in new court filing\nEvan Mealins is the justice reporter for The Tennessean.

      "text": "'Outlandish and inaccurate': John Oates lashes back at Daryl Hall in new court filing\nDays after Daryl Hall filed a lawsuit and received a temporary restraining order against his past musical partner John Oates, a new document reveals Hall's feelings about John Oates' recent business undertakings with their joint venture. Hall's impassioned declaration calls Oates' actions \"the ultimate partnership betrayal.\"\nLate Wednesday evening, a new filing from Oates lashed back against Hall, calling the accusations \"inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate.\"\nThe two musicians, previously duo Hall & Oates, are known for songs \"Maneater\" and \"You Make My Dreams (Come True).\"\nBelow, The Tennessean sums up the facts of the case and Daryl Hall's publicly-available statement on the dispute filed in Nashville Wednesday afternoon.\nWhy is Daryl Hall suing John Oates?\nHall sued longtime music partner John Oates on Nov. 16, days after he says he also began a private arbitration against Oates.\nThe dispute centers around Oates\u2019 alleged attempt to sell his half of the assets of the duo\u2019s joint venture, Whole Oats Enterprises, to a third-party publishing company called Primary Wave Music.\nHall contends that such a sale would violate a business agreement they reached in 2021, which he says requires the other partner give written approval to any sale \u2014 approval that Hall is adamant he will not give in this case.\nOates' wife Aimee Oates and Richard Flynn, who are both co-trustees of The John W. Oates TISA Trust and were parties to the October 2021 agreement governing Whole Oats Enterprises, are also named defendants in Hall's lawsuit.\nWhile Hall began the process of arbitration on Nov. 9, no arbitrator had yet been selected and therefore could not stop a potential sale of Whole Oates Enterprises, according to court documents. Fearing that Oates would complete the sale as soon as Nov. 20, per court records, Hall filed the lawsuit seeking an order blocking the sale.\nChancellor Russell T. Perkins issued a temporary restraining order the same day the lawsuit was filed. That restraining order is set to expire after 15 days.\nHall\u2019s attorneys have asked for a more permanent type of court order called a temporary injunction that would block the sale of Whole Oats Enterprises for a longer period of time after its expiration.\nAttorneys will argue whether Perkins should issue that injunction at the hearing scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 30, at 9:30 a.m.\nMore: The Daryl Hall and John Oates legal battle explained ahead of Nashville court date\nWhat did Daryl Hall say about the lawsuit in his declaration from Nov. 29?\nThe declaration from Hall features 21 points, each of which details his understanding of a series of events that led to the suit and restraining order.\nHall's statement says: \"While falsely contending over the last several months that the Oates Trust wanted to maintain ownership in [Whole Oats Enterprises], John Oates and the Co-Trustees engaged in the ultimate partnership betrayal.\n\"They surreptitiously sought to sell half of the [Whole Oats Enterprises] assets without obtaining my written approval. Mutual approval over the power to sell partnership assets is inarguably the most important consent in any partnership.\"\nHe adds that, \"there is no amount of money that could compensate me for being forced to partner with an entity that I did not agree to partner with, and whose business model does not comport with my views,\" writing that the harm from being forced to partner with Primary Wave \"is unimaginable.\"\nHall closed out his declaration by writing that he was \"deeply troubled by the deterioration of my relationship with, and trust in, John Oates.\n\"His and the Oates Trust\u2019s actions\u2014 entering into an agreement for the sale of their WOE partnership interest, in breach of our partnership agreement, without my written approval and while intentionally concealing it from me while we were actively engaging in the mediation process over the very same assets \u2014 has caused me an enormous amount of distress,\" Hall wrote. \"Without the relief requested being granted, John Oates and the Oates Trust will have forced a sale of [Whole Oates Enterprises] assets and invoked attendant obligations to my great detriment and without my permission.\"\nHall declared his statement under penalty of perjury.\nIn his response late Wednesday, Oates denied the accusations.\n\"I am tremendously disappointed that Daryl Hall decided to file his declaration from our private arbitration in this proceeding and make inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements about me,\" Oates said in the filing, later adding: \"I have no idea who or what is motivating Daryl to take these steps and make such salacious statements, but I am deeply hurt.\"\nWhat is next for the Hall vs. Oates case?\nReporters from The Tennessean will be present at the Nashville proceeding on Nov. 30 and will report on changes and updates in the case.\nEvan Mealins is the justice reporter for The Tennessean.

      "text": "The Daryl Hall and John Oates legal battle explained ahead of Nashville court date\nIn the wake of a lawsuit filed by Daryl Hall against former bandmate John Oates on Nov. 16, music fans were left in the dark about the rift between the two singer-songwriters.\nMost of the details of the lawsuit were sealed until the judge released some documents, including a redacted copy of the complaint, last Wednesday. Many specifics of the case, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court, are still unknown.\nThe lawsuit follows a planned business deal by Oates to sell off part of the pair's joint venture.\nHere's what you should know about Hall vs. Oates ahead of a proceeding in Nashville on Nov. 30.\nWhat is Hall and Oates' relationship history?\nDaryl Hall and John Oates comprise the pop duo Hall & Oates, which formed in the early 1970s in Philadelphia. The two are best known for hits \"You Make My Dreams (Come True),\" \"Maneater\" and \"Rich Girl.\"\nThey duo never had a publicized split but have told media outlets they have been drifting apart over recent years. Both have been pursuing individual careers and distancing themselves from their hits of the past.\nWhy is Daryl Hall suing John Oates?\nDaryl Hall is suing John Oates because of Oates' plan to sell a portion of their joint venture to a third party, which Hall says would violate a business agreement between the two musicians reached on Oct. 15, 2021.\nHall is suing to block the sale until an arbitrator weighs in on the issue. While Hall had already begun a private arbitration process before filing the lawsuit on Nov. 16, he feared that unless he sued, Oates would continue with the sale as soon as Nov. 20 because an arbitrator hadn't yet been selected.\nThe sale of shares of Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave Music cannot take place until the private arbitration process concludes or a temporary restraining order in the case expires.\nHall said in the complaint that he is also seeking damages \"incurred as a result of Defendants' multiple breaches of\" their business agreement.\nPrimary Wave already owns the copyright and music publishing interests for a variety of Hall & Oates' hits, like \"Maneater\" and \"Private Eyes.\"\nIn a court filing on Nov. 29, Hall wrote an impassioned declaration calling Oates' recent undertakings with their joint venture \"the ultimate partnership betrayal.\"\nOates responded with his own Declaration on the evening of Nov. 29, stating that Hall has made \"inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements\" about him.\nOates said, \"I have no idea who or what is motivating Daryl to take these steps and make such salacious statements, but I am deeply hurt.\"\nWhy is there a restraining order?\nChancellor Russell T. Perkins issued a temporary restraining order on Nov. 16 prohibiting Oates from completing the sale of shares of Whole Oats Enterprises to Primary Wave.\nTemporary restraining orders in Tennessee last up to 15 days, although they can be renewed by a judge. Hall has also asked the judge to issue a temporary injunction blocking the sale, which would last through the end of the case.\nWhat does the lawsuit mean for John Oates and Daryl Hall?\nOates is currently not able to sell his shares of the joint venture.\nHall had to post a temporary restraining order bond of $50,000. The bond covers costs that may be suffered by a person who is found to have been wrongfully restrained.\nIs Daryl Hall suing any other individuals in this case?\nOates' wife Aimee Oates and Richard Flynn, who are both co-trustees of The John W. Oates TISA Trust and were parties to the October 2021 agreement governing Whole Oats Enterprises, are also named defendants in Hall's lawsuit.\nSummonses were issued to the Oates' at their Nashville home on Monday.\nWhen is the next court date for Hall vs. Oates?\nThe motion for a temporary injunction is going to be heard on Nov. 30 at 9:30 a.m. in Perkins' courtroom in Nashville. Perkins will also hear arguments from the attorneys over whether to keep certain documents in the case under seal.\nThe gag order in the case will expire Thursday afternoon unless extended by Perkins.\nReporters from The Tennessean will be present for the hearing and will update information as new developments in the case occur."

      "text": "John Oates Is Pretty Sure Hall & Oates Are Never, Ever Getting Back Together\nWhen John Oates spoke to Rolling Stone in January 2020, he explained how balancing his time between massive Hall & Oates concerts with his longtime creative partner Daryl Hall and intimate solo gigs provided him with a dream life. \u201cIt keeps me balanced,\u201d he said. \u201c[When I tour solo], I carry my own gear. I show up with my guitar in my hand and put the amp in the back of my car. It\u2019s real and I love it. Then I go out there with Daryl and we\u2019re flying around in private planes and playing the Garden and doing all that. I love it.\u201d\nIt was therefore a pretty big shock when, in November 2023, Hall accused Oates of committing the \u201cultimate partnership betrayal\u201d by attempting to sell his share of their business without his permission in a legal filing that generated headlines all across the globe. They haven\u2019t played a show together since October 2022. \u201c[I am] deeply troubled by the deterioration of my relationship with, and trust in, John Oates,\u201d Hall told the court. \u201cHis behavior has become adversarial and aggressive instead of professional and courteous.\u201d\nOates wasn\u2019t willing to discuss details of the ongoing legal battle when he spoke with RS recently about his new solo LP Reunion. But he did explain why his attitude toward Hall & Oates shifted so dramatically.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what changed,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the pandemic, there were no more private planes. There were no more arena shows or even acoustic shows. It gave me a chance to step back. I had a chance to reevaluate things. My wife and I decided it was time to give back. We started the Oates Song Fest for Feeding America, and we fed 350,000 families with that. And then I was asked to do Movember, which was a men\u2019s health movement. I just got out of the mode of getting back on stage with the big band and the big production.\u201d\nThat big Hall & Oates production was at the center of his life for more than 50 years. He\u2019s delivered hits like \u201cManeater,\u201d \u201cPrivate Eyes,\u201d and \u201cKiss on My List\u201d alongside Hall well over a thousand times each. \u201cI understand why people come and want to hear the big hits,\u201d he says. \u201cThose songs are going to live forever. But I wanted to relegate them to the classic file that they\u2019re in. And I wanted them to be heard in the best possible light, the way they were when the spark was on fire in the Seventies and Eighties. That\u2019s when those songs really resonated. To keep playing them, for me, was no longer interesting. I just wanted to do something else.\u201d\nIn his perfect world, the business dispute with Hall \u2014 what Oates calls \u201ca very boring business issue\u201d \u2014 would never have become public. \u201cThere\u2019s always disputes when people are famous. People are always fascinated about the dynamics of a duo,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd to be quite honest, Daryl and I have a business partnership, and there was some things about the business that we disagreed with, which happens all the time in business. And we\u2019re going to work it out.\u201d (A rep for Hall did not respond to Rolling Stone\u2018s request for comment.)\nLast year, Hall played a series of dates with Todd Rundgren. At the end of the night, they sang each other\u2019s songs together, including the Hall & Oates 1979 classic \u201cWait for Me.\u201d The lawsuit hit right before he flew out to begin a new leg of the tour in Asia, and Hall accused of Oates of trying to sabotage the tour. \u201cThis recent bad faith conduct by John Oates and the Oates Trust has created tremendous upheaval, harm, and difficulty in my life,\u201d Hall wrote in a legal filing. \u201cI believe that John Oates timed the Unauthorized Transaction to create the most harm to me.\u201d\nOates says this is untrue. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said?\u201d Oates asks. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he was going on tour. I had nothing to do with that. If that\u2019s how he perceived it, then that\u2019s how he perceived it. But, really honestly, I don\u2019t follow him on social media. In fact, I don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing. I hope he\u2019s doing well and I hope he\u2019s having a time of his life, but it\u2019s not part of my life.\u201d\nAccording to Oates, he was also unaware that Hall was touring America with Elvis Costello later this year until RS informed him of the news. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that, in a way, this situation has given him the opportunity to be himself,\u201d Oates says. \u201cAnd however he wants to show himself and perform and be creative as an individual, I think it\u2019s great, because that\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d\nDespite all the current drama, Hall & Oates never formally broke up \u2014 they just stopped booking concert dates \u2014 and Wikipedia lists the duo\u2019s active years as \u201c1970-present.\u201d Should an official end date be added to the career of one of the most successful pop duos of all time? \u201cYou can ask Daryl the same question,\u201d Oates says. \u201cBut, yes. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019ve moved on. I feel like I have a new lease on my creative life.\u201d\nHe then picks up a book and begins reading a passage. \u201cI\u2019m basically a Taoist,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to read you something that was in my daily meditation today. It says, \u2018The rule for those who follow Tao is this, \u2018Walk the path together as long as you can, and when you must part, never hold your companion back.'\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about things,\u201d he continues. \u201cA good friend of mine said something to me when this was all starting. He said, \u2018John, you were a musician before you met Daryl, and you\u2019re still a musician. You\u2019re an individual.\u2019 And Daryl and I have always called ourselves Daryl Hall and John Oates, because we always wanted to be perceived as two individuals who work together. That was very important to us. If you look at the albums, you\u2019ll see that on every album. And so this is the ultimate expression of that.\u201d\nHowever, Hall and Oates were also best friends. They even lived in an apartment together. The name of the group came from what their landlord scribbled on their mailbox: Hall & Oates. While they may never play together again, Oates doesn\u2019t rule out repairing their friendship.\n\u201cI\u2019m always open for that,\u201d he says. \u201cDaryl Hall is an amazing individual. He is one of the great, great songwriters of all time, and without a doubt, one of the great singers of all time. I would never say anything negative about him. But we have a different strategy for our lives, and we have a different strategy for our business lives as well as our personal lives. And that\u2019s that, so be it. We\u2019re old guys. We deserve to be allowed to do whatever we want to do.\u201d\nDoes he hope those old guys can one day perform one last song together to end the story on a positive note? \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see it. I really don\u2019t. Life is funny though. You never know what kind of curve it will throw you.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Daryl Hall and John\u202fOates settled their business dispute over the sale of a stake in their joint venture, Whole\u202fOats\u202fEnterprises, through arbitration, leading Hall to dismiss his lawsuit without prejudice on August\u202f11. The case had earlier seen a temporary restraining order blocking Oates\u2019 planned sale to Primary\u202fWave\u202fMusic, pending an arbitrator\u2019s decision. Hall accused Oates of a \u2018partnership betrayal\u2019 by attempting to sell without Hall\u2019s written approval, while Oates countered that Hall\u2019s claims were \u2018inflammatory and inaccurate.\u2019 The settlement leaves the sale\u2019s outcome unclear, but the parties are no longer in court and may potentially refile the issue later.}",
