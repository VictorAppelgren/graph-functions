  "description": "'Yakuza 0: Director\u2019s Cut', 'Sonic X Shadow Generations', and 'Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3 + 4' have all seen their biggest discounts yet.",
  "content": "SAVE UP TO $15: As of Aug. 28, Yakuza 0: Director\u2019s Cut, Sonic X Shadow Generations, and Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3 + 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 are all down to their lowest-ever prices at Amazon.\n\nIf you\u2019re like many Nintendo Switch 2 owners who\u2019ve been holding off on buying physical third-party games, these price cuts make it the best time to add to your collection. As of Aug. 28, three big-name releases \u2014 Yakuza 0: Director\u2019s Cut, Sonic X Shadow Generations, and Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3 + 4 \u2014 have all hit their lowest-ever prices since launching on the platform, now up to $15 off.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that third-party games on the Switch 2 haven\u2019t exactly been flying off shelves, with first-party titles like and dominating sales. Between the backlash over \u201ccode in box\u201d releases (nobody likes buying a case with just a download slip inside) and ongoing scepticism around Nintendo\u2019s Game-Key Card program, many players have been skipping full-priced third-party offerings.\n\nHowever, these price drops make them a lot easier to justify. Bargains this big, so soon after release, seem to be telling the story that gamers are unwilling to purchase a physical release if it merely acts as a license to download the game. That said, Nintendo's (and Amazon\u2019s) loss is your gain with these huge discounts.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nYakuza 0: Director\u2019s Cut, which many would say it the most popular third-party Switch 2 game outside of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, is surprisingly down almost $13. This deal is also available at Best Buy.\n\nSet in the gritty underworld of 1988 Japan, this prequel to the long-running series blends hard-hitting brawler combat with an elaborate crime drama.\n\nThe Director\u2019s Cut expands the original hit 2015 game with never-before-seen cutscenes, giving deeper insight into the lives of Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima. Combat is more dynamic than ever thanks to three switchable fighting styles, and the new online \u201cRed Light Raid\u201d mode lets you join forces with friends to take down waves of enemies.\n\nThe only element that\u2019s really been holding this game back is the Game-Key Card for its physical editions, meaning the cartridge doesn\u2019t actually contain the game \u2014 you have to download it instead. So, at $37, this is a rare chance to dive into the best version of one of SEGA\u2019s most acclaimed story-driven titles without paying full price \u2014 if that\u2019s enough to help you get over the fact you aren\u2019t buying a purely physical game.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe Switch 2 version of Sonic X Shadow Generations has also taken on a price dip, dropping to $39.99 for the first time. This refreshed edition of Sonic Generations brings together modern and classic Sonic gameplay in a massive celebration of the franchise\u2019s past, with revamped 2D and 3D stages and newly enhanced cinematics.\n\nThe highlight of this edition is the brand-new Shadow storyline, which introduces new abilities, challenges, and a darker story that fleshes out one of Sonic\u2019s most popular characters. Considering it has been stuck at $49.99 since launch, this drop makes it the perfect time to grab it for less.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nFans of skateboarding classics can now grab Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3 + 4 for its lowest price yet on Switch 2. This remastered collection brings the iconic Pro Skater 3 and 4 into the modern age with sharper HD visuals, improved controls, and the return of the beloved two-minute runs.\n\nIt also includes online multiplayer for up to eight skaters, plus enhanced Create-A-Skater and Create-A-Park modes that let you design and share custom content for the first time on a Nintendo system. At just under $35, it\u2019s an easy recommendation for anyone craving the smooth handling and arcade chaos of the golden age of skateboarding games.\n\nEven though this is just a download code in a box, arguably the most offensive kind of physical release you can buy, getting $15 off the price tag takes a lot of the sting out of the situation.\n\nIf you're still looking for new stuff to play, check out our roundup of Switch 2 games that you can buy (and actually play) right now.",

      "text": "Despite being a lifelong appreciator of Nintendo games, Donkey Kong as a character has never resonated with me all that much. I blame 1999\u2019s Donkey Kong 64.\nThe first attempt at a 3D platformer starring Nintendo\u2019s simian superstar came out when I was a kid with an insatiable curiosity for video games. It also sucks to an almost unbelievable degree. DK64 is a grimy and unpleasant mess, loaded with tedious collectibles that notoriously take dozens of hours to accumulate. (Don\u2019t play Donkey Kong 64. I hated it then and I hate it now. That\u2019s my review.)\nOh yeah, I guess I\u2019m here to review another game, huh? Well, Donkey Kong Bananza is just about the opposite of 64 in every way that matters. The first big post-launch Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive will be a welcome reprieve from Mario Kart World for early adopters, thanks to its beautifully elegant movement mechanics, delightfully destructible environments, and a new(-ish) companion character for Donkey Kong who almost steals the show by herself.\nIn other words, they finally made a good 3D platformer starring Donkey Kong, and anyone who bought a Switch 2 at or around launch should probably pick it up. Mario Kart is great, but this is the Switch 2 game you\u2019ve really been waiting for. Scott Stein, editor at large at our sister site, CNET, gave his own review of the amazing game, and he agrees.\nDonkey Kong Bananza gives DK a new best friend\nBananza comes from the same internal team at Nintendo that developed Super Mario Odyssey, which is exemplified by its storytelling that prioritizes charm and good vibes over lore and dialogue.\nIt\u2019s essentially a reboot for the Donkey Kong character, and he's given a brand new design that, frankly, makes the one that's been in use for the past 30 years look\u2026not great by comparison. Bananza begins with DK (who is a miner in search of banana-shaped rocks) being helplessly sucked down into a world that exists beneath the planet\u2019s surface. Before long, DK links up with Pauline, a 13-year-old human girl who rides around on his shoulder as the two dive deeper into the underworld in hopes of finding a way back up to the surface.\nYes, this is the same Pauline who was Donkey Kong\u2019s kidnapping victim in the original Donkey Kong arcade game. No, Bananza does not take even one second to address whatever \u201ccontinuity errors\u201d you might think exist here. Nintendo doesn\u2019t care and neither should you. They made Pauline a kid and made her friends with DK this time because they thought it would be fun. They were right.\nAs expressive and hilarious as the new Donkey Kong is most of the time, Pauline is the secret sauce that makes Bananza work on a vibes level. Giving our beloved ape a human companion who can speak for him in cutscenes and who offers goofy little insights every now and then helps add a lot of personality to the proceedings. What\u2019s even better is that Pauline is perfectly believable as a 13-year-old girl; she feels three-dimensional, expressing a wide array of emotions throughout the story, all while occasionally cracking the kinds of corny jokes that young teens are wont to crack. Her personal journey, which revolves around her increasing confidence in her magical singing abilities, is also pretty endearing.\nI hope I\u2019m not succumbing to recency bias here, but I do think this version of Pauline is one of the best companion characters in a Nintendo game in a long time.\nBananza revels in recklessness\nOf course, this is a 3D platformer, so there are only a small handful of cutscenes in Bananza and the story\u2019s not really what anyone is here for. I am pleased to report, in that case, that the 3D platforming on offer here is airtight, with lots of room for player freedom and highly enjoyable movement mechanics.\nNintendo\u2019s big gimmick here is that Donkey Kong can use his substantive fists to pound through sand, rock, stone, gold, and most of the other materials that make up each of Bananza\u2019s sprawling, open-ended levels. If you know there\u2019s a Banandium Gem (this game\u2019s main omnipresent collectible) behind a wall that\u2019s in front of you, most of the time, you can just punch the wall until there isn\u2019t a wall anymore. This is one of the most self-evidently fun game mechanics I\u2019ve seen all year. Who doesn\u2019t love busting up levels?\nThat said, this could have easily gone sour. There\u2019s another world, not far from this one, where Bananza is a confusing mess of a game full of bugs and camera problems that make its destructive gameplay burdensome rather than delightful. However, somehow, some way, the Odyssey team figured out how to make all of it just work. It\u2019s surprisingly hard to get lost thanks to a very effective map and intuitive level design that subtly encourages the player to wreak havoc in certain areas without outright holding their hand. And if you do get a little too reckless and find yourself unable to progress, you can simply restore all the terrain you destroyed with a button in the pause menu.\nI\u2019m not surprised that the destructive elements of Bananza are fun, but I am pleasantly surprised that they\u2019re as elegant as they are. There are lots of potential interactions between different materials in Bananza, as you can pick up soft dirt and throw it at hard surfaces to create platforms or harness the explosive properties of gold (don\u2019t think too hard about it) to clear out surfaces that are too hard to punch through.\nShockingly, this never really becomes confusing at any point in the roughly 15-20 hours it takes to wrap a bow on the game. If you find yourself needing a certain material to progress, it\u2019s always somewhere nearby. What\u2019s more impressive is that you hardly ever need to stop and think about it, as Bananza\u2019s visual language is clean enough that you can usually figure out what to do in any given situation just by scanning it with your eyes for a few seconds.\nCombat is also a lot more fun here than it normally is in 3D platformers. You can really feel the immense weight of DK\u2019s punches as they land on enemies, especially in situations where a punch sends an enemy careening into another enemy for a double kill. I do have one minor criticism here, though, which is that a few of the early-game boss fights are a bit too basic and easy for my liking. There were some that I beat in literally about 30 seconds. Bonanza makes up for this in the back half with some extremely good late encounters, but still, I wasn\u2019t sold on the boss fights in the first few hours.\nIt\u2019s a good time to just move around these levels\nOne major reason why Super Mario Odyssey was so well-regarded is that its basic platforming mechanics are gorgeously intuitive and versatile. Bananza is no different.\nThe simple act of moving from place to place as DK is a great time in and of itself. He\u2019s got a great roll move that you can use to pick up speed either on the ground or in the air, and you can even punch in the middle of a roll. DK can also climb most vertical surfaces with no limitations, creating lots of fun level design opportunities that the game definitely takes advantage of. Animations flow together beautifully so nothing ever feels rigidly mechanical.\nAdmittedly, it takes about half an hour to get used to how it all works. There are four face buttons on a Switch 2 controller, and three of them are dedicated to different types of punches here. It just doesn\u2019t control quite like any other recent big-name platformer I\u2019m aware of. But once you get the hang of it, it feels incredible to effortlessly bound around these levels in a way that feels appropriately animalistic.\nPauline isn\u2019t just a cosmetic partner for Donkey Kong, though, as her singing abilities allow for the use of Bananza forms. These transform Donkey Kong into different animals (such as a swole zebra or a beefy ostrich) with different use cases. The Zebra can run really fast, making it perfect for crossing platforms that crumble beneath your feet, while the ostrich can glide over large gaps. You can even switch between forms on the fly for fun platforming combo opportunities.\nBananza forms add a lot of great variety to Bananza\u2019s moment-to-moment action, but I wish I could say the same for the game\u2019s upgrade system. There\u2019s a very basic skill tree here that includes passive upgrades for DK and his various Bananza forms, as well as some very useful abilities you can only unlock there. You unlock skill points by collecting Banandium Gems, which is admittedly a smart way to incentivize thorough exploration.\nStill, something about this just didn\u2019t sit quite right with me. It feels a little tacked on, and many of the upgrades feel like things you should just have access to by default. Bananza forms in particular feel underpowered when first unlocked, which is a weird and disappointing dynamic for a 3D platformer. I don\u2019t think the presence of the skill tree or its shortcomings will be enough to significantly hinder anyone\u2019s enjoyment of Bananza, but I also can\u2019t imagine it being anyone\u2019s favorite part of the game, either.\nBananza one-ups Mario Odyssey in one key area\nI loved Mario Odyssey, but I had (and continue to have) a major hang-up with it: The pacing is nuts. Mario\u2019s first trip through most of the game\u2019s levels is generally linear and a little rushed, with the expectation that you\u2019ll go back and clear them out later after you\u2019ve left for the next story beat. It created a strange feeling of being pushed through the game faster than I would have liked.\nBonanza is not a significantly longer game by any stretch of the imagination, clocking in at 13 hours before I saw the end credits in my playthrough. But it feels much more satisfying to me because, for the most part, you can see all of a given level the first time you go there. There is a linear critical path through them all, but there are also tons of fun side activities to do and (almost) nothing feels like it\u2019s off-limits or being held back for an endgame collectible hunt.\nAs a result, I felt way more fulfilled when I saw those end credits, even though I knew I would continue playing the game because I have a sickness that can only be cured by collecting shiny things in 3D platformers. I\u2019ll need more time to ruminate on whether or not I think Bananza is a better game overall than Odyssey, but in this regard, it certainly is.\nI should also note before we're finished here that Bananza does have one more tiny little problem: performance. For the most part, the game runs at a nearly locked 60 frames per second, but there are occasional bits of slowdown. In my experience, almost all of these occurred during moments when I didn't actually have control over DK, like during short transitional cutscenes. It does rear its head during some more intense gameplay sequences, though overall, I didn't find it horribly distracting at any point.\nIs Donkey Kong Bananza worth it?\nThere\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t even gotten to, such as the outstanding soundtrack (Pauline\u2019s vocal themes in particular are killer) or the abundance of incredibly fun one-off challenge levels that you can find scattered around each world. Honestly, I\u2019d rather you all experience those things for yourselves because I think Bananza is absolutely a worthwhile investment for any Switch 2 owner. You likely already knew that and didn\u2019t need me to tell you.\nIt\u2019s not only the first good 3D platformer starring Donkey Kong, it\u2019s just a damn good one in its own right thanks to a unique set of mechanics that make it more about punching than jumping. Combine that with clever level design and a wonderfully charming pair of heroes at the center of the story, and you get the Switch 2\u2019s first stone-cold banger.\nTopics Nintendo Nintendo Switch Video Games"

      "text": "'Cyberpunk 2077' is a wondrous creation trailed by a mile-long line of asterisks\nThere's Cyberpunk 2077, the game that's coming out on Dec. 10, and Cyberpunk 2077, the monolithic creation that's been dogged by a growing body of controversy and criticism in the years since it was announced. I can't review one without discussing the other. So let's get to it.\nCD Projekt Red, the Polish studio that's also behind The Witcher series, turns its attention now to neon-drenched futurescapes and body modification. Cyberpunk is a vast role-playing game that favors exploration and an open-ended approach to charting your course through the world.\nIf you want a quick and dirty comparison: It's Blade Runner meets Strange Days, by way of Skyrim. And if you want the longer version \u2014 which you should, given that you're here already \u2014 then keep reading.\nSo you want to be a cyberhero\nThe setting is Night City, a hedonistic and distinctly American wonderland of diversity and deep contrasts. It's a place where the poor and downtrodden find ready escapes from their misery in the abundance of mind-altering substances and physically augmented \"joytoy\" sex workers, while an elite corporate class (\"corpos\") reaps all the financial rewards.\nWe've seen this kind of dystopian future fiction before, of course. In fact, Cyberpunk 2077 is based on a pen-and-paper roleplaying game of old created by Mike Pondsmith. I've never played the original, but from the little I've read about it, CDPR sticks fairly close to the source in terms of how the world is realized.\nYou play as an empty vessel named V, though you're given the opportunity to fill in some blanks almost immediately. In addition to selecting your look and gender (male/female only; no non-binary options) during character creation, you also choose a background \u2014 wasteland-dwelling nomad, streetwise city kid, or ex-corpo who left the high life behind.\nThat choice influences how and where your story begins, and also some of the dialogue options that pop up throughout the game. They're more about adding texture to the player-authored side of the plot than they are about conferring specific, tangible advantages. My own version of V is a woman who left the nomad life for the big city, and that choice of background brought more depth to conversations anytime I talked with a fellow nomad or had work to do on the outskirts of the city.\nRegardless of which choice you go with, it inevitably leads you to a Night City slum and the life of a freelance mercenary-for-hire. You survive day-to-day by finding work with local \"fixers\" (which is Cyberpunk for gang leader/crime lord), but that existence turns upside down when a particularly cherry job goes sideways.\nThis is where I get hazy with the specifics, to avoid spoilers. Events transpire from there that leave V sharing her brain with the consciousness of a long-dead terrorist named Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves). And unless she can figure out how to reconcile her split self, it's an eventual death sentence.\nNeedless to say, there's a big story here. The plot spends a lot of time forcing you to think about identity and self, and there's some inescapable dissonance in that choice given Cyberpunk's light, almost nonexistent treatment of non-binary and transgender perspectives. The original Cyberpunk RPG first released in 1988, and it often feels like CDPR's video game take is mired in the kind of dated, late 20th century thinking that still ripples into IRL trans issues today.\nIt didn't completely ruin the game for me, but it's something I thought about frequently as a player in 2020 who tends toward a compassionate view of the world. I'm not sure how a trans/NB player might respond to the game's almost total non-address of our expanding awareness of identity, but it sure feels like a big whiff in the midst of a story that's so steeped in such things. (If you want to know more, this excellent look at the game's \"edgy\" marketing campaign from Polygon is a great place to start.)\nWelcome to Night City\nAs any fan of games like the Elder Scrolls series or CDPR's own The Witcher 3 will tell you, the world itself is a star in its own right. That's absolutely true in Cyberpunk 2077.\nNight City is a massively impressive creation. It's a sprawling futureworld metropolis of soaring towers and multilevel streets, with the city's grit and grime becoming more apparent as you delve down lower. There's a story behind every street and alleyway, inscribed into the cracked asphalt, the graffiti-strewn walls, the gleaming corporate towers, and the crowded market stalls.\nThe presentation is more than a little gratuitous. Virtually every billboard you see involves sex, mind-altering substances, or body mods. There's an invisible layer of sleaze complementing Night City's visible filth. Sex work is absolutely work in our real world, but Cyberpunk 2077 makes it all feel seedy and exploitative. Joytoys for hire are stationed all throughout Night City and the sex montage you're treated to when you visit one is pure cringe.\nThe city is also littered with discarded \"studded dildos,\" to the point that it feels like some kind of statement. Why so many? And why am I finding them in places like a grimy crawlspace above an office in an abandoned warehouse that sits on top of an underground drug lab? I found hundreds of sex toys as I played, many more than the ashtrays, paperwork, and other, more typical detritus you can collect and break down into crafting materials.\nIt can also be a confusing space to navigate, with seemingly close locations often taking extra time to reach because of all the ramps and interchanges connecting different levels of the city (at least until you start souping up your cybernetics). It's a little like trying to get around Los Angeles in that way, only there's much more neon lighting.\nAnd hey, let's talk about that lighting. I played on PC using a machine I built in late 2019 \u2014 in other words, hardware that was more than equipped to showcase the best of what Cyberpunk 2077 has to offer, including an Nvidia 2080 Super that plays nice with ray tracing. I can honestly tell you that this is the first game I've played where the new-fangled graphics feature actually feels transformative.\nCyberpunk 2077 is the first game I've played where ray tracing feels transformative.\nWithout getting into the deep technical dive, ray tracing offers vastly improved lighting effects. This manifests in a number of ways. Stroll by a window and you'll see the surrounding world accurately reflected back at you. The same goes for the way ambient lighting touches and moves across cars \u2014 Night City is filled with nifty-looking futuristic cars \u2014 while you're driving. It also gives everything from smoke effects to sunlight glinting off the pavement a more realistic look.\nOnce Cyberpunk gets its \"next-gen\" upgrade post-release (no date set for that yet), people who own a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S/X will also get to enjoy the benefits of ray tracing. And I have to say: It has such a dramatic impact on how you perceive the game world that you're better off waiting for the update to arrive if you want to play on one of those machines. And if you're on an older PC, this is the kind of game that merits looking into some component upgrades.\nIt's not just visual splendor that makes Night City worth visiting. The streets are also buzzing with life and activity. Some of it is mundane, like the heavy foot traffic you encounter when you wander into a street market. But the inherent lawlessness of the city makes itself known again and again, with police activities and gang violence cropping up on virtually every corner.\nThese aren't just static encounters, but rather events that spring up in a living world. You can get involved or not. Sometimes, you'll even land in the middle of a conflict you had no part in starting, just because you were running away from something (or toward something) and took a wrong turn. And while the illusion may not be perfect \u2014 for 35 hours, the same two cops had the same perp handcuffed and lying on the floor outside my apartment \u2014 it's convincing enough.\nThere's also the cast of more fully developed characters, the people you spend time with as V takes on jobs and builds her reputation in Night City. Cyberpunk suffers from the same issues as other games like this, where the animated performances miss tons of emotional nuance and only rarely match up well with whatever the character is saying.\nIt's at least getting better. You'll occasionally catch someone breaking into a sly grin or tilting their head in just such a way as they're making a point. For a game this large, with so much going on, that kind of attention to detail is both impressive and welcome. But the stilted animations still far outweigh the nuanced flourishes of emotion.\nThat puts more weight on the voice performances, and here Cyberpunk delivers. Reeves' Johnny Silverhand is of course a huge piece of your journey. He's not quite an antagonistic figure, but he's no ally either. That makes his near-constant presence in your day-to-day doings the game's strongest characterization outside of Night City itself.\nThat doesn't mean he's the only one, though. From a rough-and-tumble outsider nomad to a salty, guarded \"ripperdoc\" (person who installs cybernetic implants) and the lively AI proprietor of a local car service, there's a hefty supporting cast helping you feel connected to the world. There's a lot of technojargon and futureworld lingo for you to decipher, but once you get past the bumpy stretch of opening hours, Cyberpunk's unique speech rhythms start to settle in.\nPlaying your role\nEverything you do on the gameplay front in Cyberpunk 2077 is guided by the choices you make for your own version of V. The RPG-style leveling \u2014 which consists of assigning attribute points and unlocking perks \u2014 is preposterously deep. But it doesn't have to be if that's not how you want to play.\nThe top-level attributes govern your key capabilities: \"Body\" determines your strength, health, and stamina; \"Cool\" governs stealth; \"Technical\" is for crafting; \"Intelligence\" is for hacking; and \"Reflex\" is for gunplay and agility. You boost these once per level, with the numbers dictating which gear you can use, which doors you can open, and which terminals you can hack.\nThen there are perks. They're found in submenus tied to each attribute, and every attribute has two or three pages worth to unlock. Some perks increase damage with specific weapons, others increase your health or stamina, or unlock different hacking skills. It's so much. In my 35-hour playthrough \u2014 the full story plus a healthy amount of optional sidequests \u2014 I never ventured more than one page deep into any the perk options.\nThe RPG-style leveling is preposterously deep, but it doesn't have to be if that's not how you want to play.\nFor people who want to dive deep and commit to spending 100-plus hours in Night City, that kind of depth isn't a bad thing. The same goes for those who want to really get into a particular role-play approach. If you want your V to be the absolute master of all things hacking, ignoring guns and stealth and the option of a deeper health pool or greater carrying capacity, you can do it. It can be fun and even rewarding, especially for a game that, to me, felt a little too easy on its default difficulty.\nAnd if you just want to breeze through the story and only dip a toe into the character leveling, that's totally possible. The deeper you dig into each page of perks, the lower the impact those perks tend to have. It's a sharp approach that gives committed players something to chew on without leaving the less invested crowd at a disadvantage.\nThe more dramatic character tweaks you can make tend to come from your cybernetic enhancements. These are often pricey things to buy in a world where jobs don't always pay well, but they can also change the way you play. You can boost your jumps or upgrade to double jumps; unlock the ability to take full advantage of smart weapons and their homing bullets; and even equip yourself with new, powered arms fitted with retractable blades or hidden guns.\nIn practice, all of these separate pieces can be tough to manage in the moment. There's a steep learning curve in combat, for example, if you want to play as a hacker first, gun-shooter second. These deeper systems aren't ever explained very well, despite the presence of an entire, optional tutorial mission. By the time credits rolled on my game, I still wasn't 100 percent clear on how the RAM budgeting that governs your in-combat hacking actually works.\nCyberpunk 2077 is nothing if not forgiving, though. The default difficulty felt most challenging to me when I took on the (rare) bosses, but basic combat against weaker enemies is a good place to experiment. And you can always ratchet up the difficulty if you want a stiffer challenge.\nThe only spot that really tripped me up is driving. Pretty much every car or bike I got to drive handled like it was on lightly salted ice. On more occasions than I can count, I had to spend extra minutes getting back to the road \u2014 or just ditched my ride entirely \u2014 because walking was plain easier. I can't tell you how many times police gunned me down for accidentally mowing through a crowd during a particularly sharp turn.\nThe big picture\nAll of these pieces come together around a game that, at launch, is technically unsound and dogged by controversy. CDPR is releasing a day one patch that will hopefully fix the worst of the issues. Some of that patch went live during the review process, and it brought some fixes. But don't expect a totally stable and perfectly tuned game even after the full patch is live. Work will surely be ongoing for months after launch.\nThe fact still remains that for a game of this size and scale, and one which has already been delayed several times because it wasn't quite ready before, there's virtually no way to ensure a smooth experience at launch. Call it \"early access,\" call it coming in hot...however you think about it, the result is a game that feels like it's in rough shape on day one.\nThere's a larger conversation to be had there about how the industry works with major game releases like this, of course. In recent months, quality reporting has revealed that CDPR workers put in an unhealthy number of hours to get the game done on time. And let's be clear: Cyberpunk 2077 is definitely not done. It may be playable, but it's not running smoothly and likely won't until we're a few post-release patches in.\nWhat's more, there's also been a late-breaking revelation that the game in its launch form presents a seizure risk. As of Dec. 8, a couple days before launch, CDPR has acknowledged the risk and promised that work is underway on adding a warning. Keep your eye on the studio's social feed for more info.\nNone of these factors completely torpedo the value of Cyberpunk 2077 as a gaming experience, but all of them together make it tough to recommend at launch. Not that it will matter for some. If you've been following every twist and turn of development, every preview and early look, then I'm not going to change your mind and I never was.\nFor everyone else, tread cautiously. I enjoyed my time in Night City, and I'm looking forward to diving back in to run through the story again as a street kid or ex-corpo. But I'm not going to bother until the game is in better shape, and I'd recommend the same for anyone else. Much like it was with The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 won't be its truest and best self until months after its release.\nCyberpunk 2077 releases for PC/Windows, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms on Dec. 10.\nTopics Gaming\nAdam Rosenberg is a Senior Games Reporter for Mashable, where he plays all the games.

      "text": "My 4 favorite Nintendo Switch games that got upgrades for the Switch 2\nTable of Contents\nIf you're holding off on getting a Nintendo Switch 2 because you think that Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza are the only two games you can play right now, you're mistaken (although, you definitely need to play both of those games). In fact, there are a lot of games you can play on the new handheld, including the best titles from the original Nintendo Switch generation \u2014 and with better visuals than ever before. That's because Nintendo has released Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for a slate of its most popular Switch games.\nCan you upgrade your Switch 1 game for the Switch 2 for free? Yes and no. While you can upgrade some Switch games for free, others require you to purchase a Switch 2 upgrade pack, though these upgrades are much cheaper than a typical video game. Each upgrade brings new features, improvements, and in some cases, brand-new game modes and DLC packs that weren't included in their original releases.\nHow do Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades work?\nAs with most things Nintendo, upgrading your old Switch games can be confusing, and it requires a little bit of brain power to figure out exactly how it works. But, to keep things simple, it comes down to this: If you already own the original game on the old Nintendo Switch, you are eligible to either buy the upgrade pack (which costs much less than the full price of the game) or upgrade for free, depending on the title.\nIf you don't already own a particular game, you still need to buy the game at full price to enjoy those upgrades for the Switch 2. This also applies to the physical copies of each eligible game.\nWhich games are eligible for Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades?\nBelow, we've put together a list of all the Nintendo Switch 2 game upgrades you can get, as well as how to get them.\nBest paid Nintendo Switch 2 game upgrades\nWhy we like it\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is considered to be one of the greatest Nintendo games ever made, so it's a no-brainer to either upgrade for just $9.99 or buy a new copy if you haven't yet played it. The Switch 2 edition of the game comes with Zelda Notes support (a \"game-specific service via Nintendo Switch App\"), better resolution and frame rates, faster load times, and HDR support.\nWhy we like it\nMany of us grew up playing the Mario Party games with our loved ones, and Jamboree is the Mario Party formula perfected. The $19.99 upgrade includes new game modes that make use of the Switch 2's mouse controls and other accessories, CameraPlay support, GameShare compatibility, enhanced resolution and frame rates, as well as access to Jamboree TV \u2014 a new game show hosted by Toad himself.\nMore games\nTo see a breakdown of new features included in each Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, check out Nintendo's helpful guide.\nKirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World \u2014 $79.99 or $19.99 to upgrade\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Nintendo Switch 2 Edition \u2014 $69.99 or $9.99 to upgrade\nPok\u00e9monLegends: Z-A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition \u2014 $69.99 or $9.99 to upgrade\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond \u2014 Coming soon\nBest free Nintendo Switch 2 game upgrades\nWhy we like it\nSuper Mario Odyssey is regarded as one of Nintendo's best-ever 3D platformers featuring the iconic Italian plumber, and its free upgrade comes with enhanced visuals, HDR support, GameShare features, and GameChat compatibility. It's the best way to play one of the best Nintendo Switch games, so don't skip over it.\nWhy we like it\nAn underrated gem from the original Nintendo Switch, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker's Switch 2 upgrade got all the same updates that Super Mario Odyssey did \u2014 better visuals, HDR support, and compatibility with the new GameShare and GameChat features. If you're looking for a fun, cute puzzle game to play through, look no further. If you already own Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, you can upgrade the title for Switch 2 for free.\nMore games\nTo see a breakdown of new features included in each free Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade, check out Nintendo's helpful guide. While you can upgrade these video games for the Switch 2 at no cost, if you don't already own the game, you'll still need to purchase the title.\nArms \u2014 $59.99\nBig Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain \u2014 $29.99\nGame Builder Garage \u2014 $29.99\nNew Super Mario Bros.

RetailMeNot Receipt Scanning. You agree to at all times provide accurate and complete information to RetailMeNot. You agree not to: submit a Receipt that is false, inaccurate, fabricated, counterfeited, incomplete, tampered with, adjusted, or otherwise inauthentic for the purpose of seeking to claim a Reward; redeem, or attempt to redeem, a Reward for products that have not actually been purchased, or for products that have been returned; submit or attempt to submit a Receipt that has already been submitted or used by you or another user; or submit Receipts outside of a Promotion Period, or for a purchase that took place prior to or after the launch date of a Rewards O\ufb00er. RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards.

In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient.

Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20.

      "text": "Gaming is a colloquial term that generally refers to the act of playing video games, or sometimes tabletop games. Those who enjoy gaming are often referred to as \u201cgamers,\u201d though many people who enjoy video games actively choose not to identify as such. Surveys indicate that around 65 percent of adults in the U.S. play video games in some form, which can mean on a dedicated console, on a personal computer, or on a mobile device like a smartphone or tablet. Gaming as we know it today has evolved greatly over time. Going back to the 1970s, it was largely done in arcades, but consoles like the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System popularized home gaming throughout the 1980s, and it has remained popular to this day. PC gaming goes back to home computers in the 1980s such as the Commodore 64, but the advent of Windows in the 1990s and digital marketplaces like Steam in the early 2000s brought PC gaming to where it is now. Handheld gaming devices like the Game Boy made gaming portable in the early 1990s, but those have given way to smartphones, with the iOS and Android app stores full of incredibly popular and lucrative games. Some of the biggest companies in the gaming industry today include Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Valve, Activision, and many more."
