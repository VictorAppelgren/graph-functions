  "content": "The inside of a Pennsylvania house of horrors where five children were allegedly locked in a 'dungeon' and subjected to severe punishment has been revealed.\n\nNew images obtained by Daily Mail show inside the squalid home in Redstone Township where James Russell Kahl, 65, and his wife Carly Kahl, 41, allegedly abused their children.\n\nAppearing to be taken when the home was on the market, the home is seen with doors hanging off hinges, unfinished paintjobs, and crumbling ceilings.\n\nIn one room with broken doors and dirty carpets, a pair of sliding windows could be seen, which police said may have been barricaded with wooden boards alongside three deadbolts on the door.\n\nInside a bedroom where the five children were allegedly kept in 'captivity', investigators said there were feces smeared across the walls, while the children were provided with a limited amount of food and clothing and no beds.\n\nRussell had reportedly forced his wife Carly to pull a Taser on one of the children within the last two weeks, before they were arrested on Wednesday.\n\n'There's no reason to be using a device like a stun gun, which is less lethal, not lethal, against a child,' Fayette County District Attorney Mike Aubele said.\n\nAlso in the home police uncovered a stun gun, a replica pistol and some drugs while conducting a search warrant.\n\nWhen cops hauled the Kahl's from their home this week, they said they found insects had overran the squalid property.\n\nOutside the home, piles of garbage and construction materials could be seen littering the property.\n\nIn a criminal complaint, police said that the room where the children were allegedly confined 'functioned as a dungeon, with video cameras hardwired to the father's room.'\n\nAuthorities now say James neglected his children - who were between the ages of five and 14 - as he smoked marijuana all day.\n\n'We have evidence that there were some cameras that were hardwired to another room where these children were being observed,' he continued.\n\nThe district attorney went on to thank the 'brave family member' who reported the 'deplorable conditions' to the state's ChildLine system.\n\n'Law enforcement cannot be in every household and every single minute of every day; we need people to come forward and think of these children,' he said.\n\nFayette County Children and Youth Services received the alert, and Pennsylvania State Police were called on to help assist them in their investigation of the claims on August 8.\n\nThat is when they first saw the squalor the children were living in inside the two-story suburban house.\n\n'It's sickening - that's the only word that I can use to describe what we saw and what those children went through,' Pennsylvania State Trooper Ally Wilson told WTAE.\n\nWhen troopers then asked about the locks, they said James told them he would 'not be removing the locks from the bedroom door for any reason.'\n\nThe children are now safely in the custody of Children and Youth Services.\n\nMeanwhile, their parents are facing endangering the welfare of children, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, use of an incapacitation device and drug charges.\n\nBail has been denied for both of the parents, who are being held at the county jail, according to court documents obtained by Daily Mail.\n\nThose documents also show that James Russell has had a series of run-ins with the law in the past, including a harassment charge he pleaded guilty to in 2006.\n\nThat same year, he was also arrested for driving under the influence, and in 2012 he was charged with a probation violation.\n\nTrooper Wilson said she now hopes 'that these parents go to jail and they answer for what they've done.'",
