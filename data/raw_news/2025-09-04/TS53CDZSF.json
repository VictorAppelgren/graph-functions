  "title": "The 4 coolest gadgets and innovations I've seen at IFA 2025 (and that you can actually buy)",
  "description": "IFA features new tech innovations, and these are the ones that thoroughly impressed me (and they're not even all about AI).",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nIFA is Europe's largest consumer electronics show, and this year is no different. IFA 2025 features some of the most eye-catching innovations ever, so much so that it's hard to narrow down the list of amazing products.\n\nHowever, at a time when the tech world is saturated with artificial intelligence (AI) adoption, I found the fact that the best products I've seen don't hinge on AI. As I walk through the halls of Messe Berlin, these are the best products I've seen and the ones I'm definitely going to watch.\n\nOne of the coolest things I've seen at IFA is Philips Hue giving existing smart lights the ability to become motion detectors for your smart home. Philips Hue just announced the new Hue Bridge Pro, a new smart hub for its Hue smart lights that has a five times faster processor and can handle up to 150 Philips Hue lights in your home.\n\nAlso: Philips Hue Bridge Pro just made it easy to add motion sensing to your old smart lights\n\nThe new Bridge Pro also supports up to four MotionAware setups, so you can set a group of Hue lights to work together as a motion detector. Seeing this in action, I was impressed at how a group of Philips Hue lights can be set up together, along with the Bridge Pro, to detect motion by recognizing changes in the wireless signals around them.\n\nThis kind of technology sounds futuristic, yet Philips Hue managed to not only make it happen but also make it available for the vast majority of its existing smart lights, excluding the first-generation and portable lights.\n\nThe Rokid Glasses are shaping up to be one of Meta's biggest competitors in the smart glasses market. Rokid's latest glasses combine augmented reality (AR) with AI, with the capacity of showing you data and letting you interact with an AI assistant. As an AI wearable, the glasses support real-time translation in 89 languages, object recognition, navigation, transcription, and more.\n\nAlso: 5 Meta Ray-Ban upgrades that have me seriously excited for September 17\n\nThese glasses are also surprisingly lightweight and thinner than other models, weighing only 1.7 ounces, which makes them a compelling option for all-day wear. Even at this weight, the Rokid Glasses have a built-in 12MP camera for taking first-person photos and videos and integrated audio to interact with the GPT-5-powered AI assistant or simply listen to your favorite music.\n\nThe glasses are available on Kickstarter and have surpassed the $1 million milestone for pledges. Rokid plans to sell the Rokid Glasses for $599.\n\nAside from being the longest-lasting robot vacuum and mop, the Ecovacs X11 Omnicyclone is also the first mainstream premium robot to feature automatic cleaning without a replaceable dust bag. This robot vacuum can wash and dry its mop roller at the dock and automatically empty its dustbin when full.\n\nThe biggest innovation about this is that it empties the dustbin into a plastic dust canister at the dock instead of relying on dust bags. This means that you'll never have to buy another dustbag for this robot vacuum, and can instead simply empty out the dust canister when full after a few weeks.\n\nAlso: Roborock's new weed-killing robot mowers will save your back (and time)\n\nCombining a large 6,400mAh battery and GaN technology at the dock, the X11 Deebot can quickly recharge each time it goes to the dock to wash its mop pad, refill its clean water tank, and empty its dustbin, gaining up to 6% of charge in only three minutes. This PowerBoost technology lets the robot clean a whopping 10,700 square feet without stopping due to low battery, making it a reliable solution to clean large areas.\n\nThe robot is also one of the smartest I've ever seen. Its voice assistant can interact with the user to answer setup questions, review troubleshooting guides, and handle complex commands.\n\nThanks to the improved TruEdge 3.0 technology, the mop roller can also reach the edge of floors alongside walls or under cabinets.\n\nI was impressed with the Ostation battery charger at CES earlier this year, but Olight just upped the ante with the Ostation 2, which automatically charges both AA and AAA batteries.\n\nMy family goes through more batteries than I'd like to publicly admit, so I've been looking at rechargeable battery stations to make the switch to a more eco-friendly solution. The biggest problem with these is that they typically only charge one kind of battery, either AA or AAA, so you'd have to buy separate stations to get both types of batteries recharged.\n\nAlso: I tried to destroy this $45 power bank (including driving over it with a tractor) - it refused to break\n\nThe Ostation 2 solves this with a charging dock that can handle both AA and AAA rechargeable batteries, capable of holding 12 of each. You don't even have to worry about lining up the battery just right -- simply drop it into one of the slots and the Ostation 2 will recharge it and release it into a sorted tray once done. This station protects rechargeable batteries from overcharging by releasing the connection once the battery is full.",

But some people demand a lot more from their power banks.\nIf you work outdoors, are a member of the emergency services, or just incredibly clumsy with your gear, you need a power bank that can survive the worst Mother Nature can throw at you.\nAlso: The best power banks you can buy in 2025\nI just happened to find one such product, and it's at the top of my list for toughness: the Elecom Nestout Outdoor Battery 5000N.\nThese power banks come in a rage of capacities \u2013 5,000mAh, 10,000mh, and 15,000mAh --- and they are IP67-rated (completely dustproof and tested to resist immersion in a meter of water for 30 minutes). They also pass the rigors of MIL-STD-810G, a demanding set of tests performed by the US Department of Defense covering various environmental stresses such as shock, vibration, extremes of temperature extremes, and humidity.\nThe lithium-ion cells holding the power are protected from knocks and water by a hard outer shell and inside that is a soft silicone cushion to absorb impacts and vibration.\nAlso: Is your phone truly waterproof? Here's what the IP rating tells you\nThe outer shells come in a range of colors, and there's a screw cap with a silicone O-ring protecting the USB ports. The 5,000mAh version has one USB-A port capable of a maximum output of 12W, and a USB-C port that handles input and output to a maximum of 15W, with a combined output with both ports of 15W.\nThere are five LEDs around the top that show battery capacity, a switch that turns the power bank off and on, and allows it to be put into 12-hour continuous output mode (Elecom make a range of accessories that fit on the power banks, things like fans and lanterns).\nOn the bottom of the power bank is a 1/4-20 screw thread for attaching it to a tripod and such, which can be handy around camp, especially if the power bank is being used with one of Elecom's accessories.\nBut it's the toughness where this power bank really stands out. I've had this power bank submerged for several days, out in the heat and rain of the UK summer, thrown it about, and it just keeps going. The polymer of the shell is very robust, and while it certainly does scratch and scuff, there's no real damage.\nI dropped bricks on it, hit it with a metal bar, and even drove a tractor over it (where it just dug itself into the dirt) but at least it stayed intact.\nThe screw cap over the USB ports is a cool feature, and much better than the little flaps that you get on a lot of outdoor products. It's a super secure way to protect what is the most vulnerable bit of a power bank.\nBest generators deals of the week\n- $169 (save $91)\n- $449 (save $351)\n- $499 (save $300)\n- $179 (save $90)\n- $599 (save $100)\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Elecom Nestout Outdoor Battery 5000N is built like a tank, and while I've tested a number of power banks that are tough, this is by far the toughest. It feels utterly bombproof, and is without a doubt overbuilt for day-to-day use.\nAlso: This Bosch screwdriver looks rough after 7 months, but it's still my #1 - here's why\nBut for situations where you're going to be relying on a power bank in the wet and cold, and a dead unit could mean the difference between success and failure, this is the power bank to take.\nBest of all, it's not as expensive as I expected. When I test things, I try to avoid knowing how much something is until I'm done. While I was testing this, I was expecting it to cost something in the region of $75 - $100, so I was surprised to find that it was $45, with the larger 10,000mAh unit being $55, and 15,000mAh one coming in at only $67."

      "text": "5 Meta Ray-Ban upgrades that have me seriously excited for September 17\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nThe hype continues to build around the arrival of Meta's futuristic Hypernova (a.k.a. Celeste) smart glasses, which will reportedly add a small heads-up display in one eye and a neural wristband (Ceres) to control the interface. These will reportedly cost around $800 and will be announced at Meta Connect on September 17. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has stated that Meta is preparing to sell 150,00-200,000 units of its Hypernova glasses over the next two years.\nSome have even started calling these the next version of the current Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. However, both Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth have been teasing that Meta will release multiple products in the smart glasses space this fall.\nAnd the CEO of EssilorLuxotica (maker of Ray-Bans), Francesco Milleri, said in early 2025 that over 2 million units of Meta Ray-Bans had already been sold and that the company was preparing to scale up to sell 10 million units annually by the end of 2026.\nAlso: Samsung 'Galaxy Glasses' powered by Android XR are reportedly on track to be unveiled this month\nAll of that points to an upgraded version of the $300 audio-only Meta Ray-Bans coming this fall -- and being announced alongside the future-oriented Hypernova glasses at Meta Connect.\nFor the past two years, I've been a daily user of the Meta Ray-Bans for audio calls, listening to podcasts and music, and taking photos. I'll be at Meta Connect in person on September 17 to see and demo everything Meta unveils. Here is the list of practical upgrades that would make Meta's AI glasses even more useful and usable.\n1. Double the battery life\nThe Meta Ray-Bans are officially rated for four hours of battery life. However, if you turn off the always-on listening for the \"Hey Meta\" prompt (and long-press the right stem to activate it instead), you can increase that pretty significantly. That's true if you're using the smart glasses mostly for phone calls, listening to audio, and perhaps a few AI prompts.\nAlso: We tested the best AR and MR glasses: Here's how the Meta Ray-Bans stack up\nHowever, once you start taking a bunch of photos and recording multiple videos, the battery can completely drain in as little as one to two hours. Of course, you can pop them back in the case and charge them to 50% in about 20 minutes or get a full charge in a little over an hour. Meta claims you can get eight full charges of the glasses from a fully charged case.\nBut what the Meta Ray-Bans need is battery life more on the level of the Meta Oakley smart glasses released in July 2025. They are rated by Meta for eight hours of battery life, and early reports from reviewers suggest that they are lasting three to four hours under heavy video and photo use. Since we know that kind of battery life is possible in a similar product, that's the kind of longevity we should expect in the new Meta Ray-Bans.\n2. Shoot horizontal photos and videos\nThe Meta Ray-Bans' most pleasant surprise when they launched in 2023 turned out to be the viability of the photos and videos -- which ended up being the equivalent of a smartphone camera from 3-4 years earlier. In other words, something along the lines of an iPhone 11 or 12 camera.\nBut once we all figured out that these photos were surprisingly usable -- and that it was super helpful to be able to take photos without pulling out our phones -- we quickly ran into the camera's biggest drawback. It only shoots in vertical / portrait mode.\nAlso: Look out, Meta Ray-Bans! These AI glasses just raised over $1M in pre-orders in 3 days\nSure, you can hack this by simply turning your head 90 degrees perpendicular to the ground and then clicking the shutter on your glasses. But no one wants to be doing that all the time, and it defeats the purpose of having an unobtrusive camera. No, what the next Meta Ray-Bans need is the option to shoot horizontal photos and videos. That will dramatically increase the usability and usefulness of these smart glasses for capturing content.\n3. Add audio note-taking\nA feature that the Meta Ray-Bans don't currently have, but you can find on other smart glasses, is the option to record a quick audio note. For example, the Even Realities G1 are a pair of smart glasses that offer this functionality today.\nIt would be terrific to trigger Meta AI to take a note, and then you could speak and have the audio captured while an LLM does speech-to-text conversion and saves both the audio and the text to a note that you can easily access on your phone.\n4. Increase camera quality\nThe camera on the Meta Ray-Bans is 12MP and shoots photos in a 3x4 aspect ratio with a resolution of 3024 x 4032 pixels. It captures video at roughly 1080p quality and a resolution around 1376 x 1840. When they launched in 2023, that camera quality was respectable.\nHowever, phone cameras have taken some big leaps forward in the past two years. And those of us who have taken lots of photos and videos on the Meta Ray-Bans have run into the limitations of the older camera sensor. It would be helpful to have a camera that has better low-light capabilities, and higher resolution video would be terrific so that we can crop in.\nAlso: Your Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses just got two significant upgrades for free - what they do\nSince the Meta Oakley glasses launched recently with 3K video (typically around 2300 x 3100 pixels), that offers hope that the third-gen Meta Ray-Bans will offer at least 3K video as well. Photo resolution remained the same on the Meta Oakley glasses. It would be great to see that upgraded on the Meta Ray-Bans 3.0 -- although that would also make the files larger and slower to transfer, but we'll talk about that next.\n5. Improve photo and video transfers\nOne of the most awkward usability challenges with the Meta Ray-Bans has been transferring the photos and videos you capture on the glasses to your phone. You have to have your phone connect to the glasses as your Wi-Fi connection, and then it makes the file transfer and disconnects. The Meta software tries to streamline and automate this, but you still have to do it every time you make a file transfer. This is clunky at best and is also prone to failing occasionally.\nAlso: Meta Ray-Bans vs. Oakley: I tested both smart glasses, there's a clear winner\nIt would be much better if the next-gen Meta Ray-Bans used a technology such as Wi-Fi Direct or a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 6e, like the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chip that will power future Samsung/Google glasses. This would allow direct transfers of photos and videos without having to do the awkward Wi-Fi connection dance that the current Meta Ray-Bans have to do. In general, it would simply make the glasses ready to be more of a full-time accessory rather than a device only used occasionally.\nFinal word\nThe are other things I'd love to see in the next version of the audio-only Meta Ray-Bans -- like a waterproofing upgrade from IPX4, support for more languages in Live Translation, a charging option for when you're still wearing the glasses, and the option to use a virtual assistant to record calls and meetings and generate notes and summaries.\nBut if Meta were to integrate the five features mentioned above into their next generation of audio smart glasses, then I suspect they'd find a lot more than 10 million people who are interested in wearing them."

With a starting price of $999, it offers a compelling blend of premium features borrowed from its more expensive sibling, all in the more manageable size of the standard Pixel 10.\nAlso: I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Pixel 10 Pro XL for a week - and can't go back\nThe Pixel 10 Pro enters a crowded field, competing directly with the iPhone 16 Pro and the Galaxy S25 Plus.\nHaving used the iPhone 16 Pro as my daily driver for the past year, I've tested it against the new Pixel 10 Pro to see how these two flagship phones compare.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want the best of Google AI\nThe Pixel phone lineup unsurprisingly offers the best of Google's Gemini AI features. And it is only getting better with the Pixel 10 Pro. The company is providing a year of Google AI Pro service for free alongside the purchase for Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. So, you get Gemini Pro, including NotebookLM for productivity and Veo 3 text-to-video generation model.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is also getting a contextual and personalized AI feature called Magic Cue. Theoretically, it can \"help connect the dots across your digital life by anticipating your needs and proactively suggesting relevant information and helpful actions based on the context on your phone.\"\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nFor instance, if you call a company's helpline, your associated details (like a flight ticket) will be surfaced automatically.\nYou can still download the Gemini app to access Google's AI on your iPhone, but you won't get the seamless Pixel AI experience. If you depend on Google apps to get work done and have all your digital life stored on Google's platforms, the Pixel 10 Pro is the better option.\n2. You want a better telephoto camera\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro features a 48MP Quad PD telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, as compared to a 12MP telephoto sensor (also 5x optical zoom) on the iPhone 16 Pro. However, megapixels don't solely define a camera. The Pixel 10 Pro sports a bigger sensor than its Apple counterpart. On paper, it is capable of letting more light in and snapping better-looking photos.\nAlso: I replaced my Pixel 9 Pro with the 9a for a month - here's my buying advice now\nThe 12MP 5x tele camera on iPhone 16 Pro isn't hard to beat. It struggles in anything less than bright daylight and lacks the zoom capabilities of its Chinese rivals. I'm looking forward to using the Google Pixel 10 Pro for my zoom shots and expect it to beat the iPhone.\n3. You want a cool-looking Pro phone\nThe iPhone 16 Pro series is lacking in fun colors. It comes in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, and Desert Titanium -- all of which feel a bit lifeless. The last Pro iPhone color I truly loved was Sierra Blue on my iPhone 13 Pro Max.\nWhile rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro might bring back more playful finishes, Google has already beaten Apple to the punch with the Pixel 10 Pro series. The new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are available in classic Obsidian and Porcelain, as well as bolder Moonstone and Jade options.\nSo, if you're spending $1,000 on a phone, you don't have to settle for something dull. Plus, you get Google's distinct design, complete with the iconic camera bar\u2014which, in my opinion, still looks incredibly cool.\n4. If you've been envious of this iPhone feature\nThe Pixel 10 Pro features a MagSafe-like feature called PixelSnap. It is based on Qi2 charging, which offers magnetic accessory support for power banks, chargers, and more. If you've been on the iPhone for a while and want to switch platforms, this is the best time to come to the Android side.\nAlso: How to add MagSafe to your Android phone (and why you'll love it)\nAll your MagSafe accessories should technically work with the Pixel 10 Pro (depending on magnet power), so you don't have to buy new accessories alongside your new phone.\nYou should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want a lighter Pro phone\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro might look better on paper, but it's nearly 10 grams heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro. Specifically, the Pixel weighs 207 grams compared to the iPhone's 199 grams.\nAlso: Buy the iPhone 16 or wait for iPhone 17? Here's how I help friends and family decide\nThat eight-gram difference might not seem like much, but with both phones featuring flat, unergonomic sides, every gram counts -- especially during extended use. If you average more than six hours of screen time a day, the iPhone 16 Pro could be the more comfortable choice.\n2. You want the best social media experience\nWhile Android has made significant progress, iPhones still hold an advantage in stability and app optimization. This is particularly noticeable with social media apps like X and Instagram, where the user experience remains smoother on Apple devices.\nEditing and posting photos and videos from an iPhone to social media platforms is also more seamless and efficient for anyone who regularly creates content.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you\nIf you're leaning toward an iPhone instead of the Pixel 10 Pro, I strongly recommend waiting just a few weeks. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 17 series in early September. It's smart to hold off on your decision until after the typical September 10th launch event to make sure you get the latest model."

At first glance, they don't seem all that useful since you can also do these actions with your mouse, but I challenge you to try them over the course of a workday; you just might notice a boost in productivity.\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nThere are lots of different types of shortcuts in Windows 11, but the best ones save you time by replacing the need to click through different context menus. A few of these are universal across applications and platforms. Ctrl + C, for example, copies text or files in any app, from Microsoft Word to photos in Google Drive.\nHere's a list of more than 40 Windows PC keyboard shortcuts you should know.\nProductivity shortcuts\nProductivity shortcuts are the key combos you'll find yourself using the most. They're easy to use and help you manage your work. Over time, these keystrokes become second nature.\n- Ctrl + C -- Copy highlighted text or a file.\n- Ctrl + V -- Paste whatever you just copied. Keeps the text's format.\n- Ctrl + Shift + V - Paste whatever you copied, but it removes the formatting.\n- Windows key (Win, for short) + V -- Opens the Clipboard tool, which contains a list of previously copied text. This helps in situations where you might've \"erased\" the previous copied item.\n- Ctrl + X -- Cuts the highlighted item. Ctrl + V restores it.\n- Ctrl + Z -- Undoes the last action, such as restoring deleted text or returning a moved file.\n- Ctrl + Y -- Redoes the action that was just undone.\n- Ctrl + F -- Opens the Find tool, so you can search for specific words or phrases.\n- Ctrl + A -- Highlight every single item in a window or text in a document.\n- Ctrl + S -- Quick save your work.\n- Ctrl + Backspace -- Delete the entire previous word\n- Ctrl + Delete -- Delete the entire next word.\nAccessibility shortcuts\nWindows 11 has various accessibility shortcuts that make the OS easier to use. These shortcuts help people with movement limitations or conditions that may restrict their usage of Windows. That said, anybody can use them to improve their experience.\n- Win + Plus (+) -- Activates the Magnifier tool and automatically zooms in on the screen.\n- Win + Minus (-) -- Zooms out while the Magnifier tool is activated. Hitting Win + Esc exits out of Magnifier.\n- Win + Ctrl + Enter -- Launches Narrator, a text-to-speech function that verbally describes what is on screen.\n- Press the Shift key five times in succession -- Turns on Sticky keys, which change how shortcuts work so you don't have to press and hold multiple keys to trigger them. For example, under Sticky Keys, double-tapping Ctrl then C has the same effect as Ctrl + C.\n- Left Shift + Left Alt + Print Screen -- Toggles high contrast mode for easier readability.\n- Win + Ctrl + C -- Toggles color filters like grayscale. The filters can be changed in the Accessibility menu to invert colors or help people with deuteranopia (also known as red-green color blindness).\n- Win + U -- Opens the Accessibility menu in Settings, where you can activate or deactivate accessibility-related features.\n- Win + Ctrl + O -- Opens the on-screen keyboard.\nNavigation shortcuts\nNavigation shortcuts allow users to move around different apps on Windows 11 without ever needing to lift their hands off the keyboard. They're especially useful for multitaskers juggling several programs at once. Once you master them, navigating your PC will feel seamless.\n- Ctrl + Alt + Tab -- Shows all open apps. Use the arrow keys to hop from one to the other.\n- Win + S -- Opens Windows Search.\n- Win + Tab -- Opens Task View, revealing all open windows and all open desktops.\n- Win + D -- Hides every window on your desktop. Pressing the keys again reveals them.\n- Win + Left or Right Directional Arrow -- Snaps the current window to the side of the screen that the arrow is pointing to.\n- Win + Up Arrow -- Maximizes a window.\n- Win + Down Arrow -- Minimizes the same window.\n- Win + Ctrl + D -- Create a new desktop.\n- Win + Ctrl + F4 -- Closes a desktop.\n- Win + Number Key -- Opens a taskbar app pinned to that number. For example, Win + 3 could open Microsoft Edge while Win + 4 opens the Microsoft Store.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook for\nFile Management shortcuts\nThe Windows 11 File Explorer has its own set of keyboard shortcuts to help users reorganize folders and files. Instead of right-clicking through menus or dragging items around to clean up clutter, these simple key presses make managing documents a breeze.\n- Win + E -- Opens File Explorer.\n- F2 -- Rename the selected file or folder. Depending on the keyboard, you may also have to hold Fn.\n- Shift + Delete -- Permanently deletes an item. Hitting just Delete only sends the file to the recycling bin.\n- Ctrl + N -- Opens a new File Explorer window. It stays on the page of the previous window.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Create a new folder.\n- Alt + Enter -- Opens the Properties window for a file and folder.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move forward or backward through your File Explorer History.\n- Alt + Up Arrow -- Go back one folder level.\nAlso: Best early Labor Day laptop deals: Sales on Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and more\nBrowser shortcuts\nBrowser shortcuts are similar to Productivity shortcuts in that they do similar things, like copying and pasting items or highlighting entire documents. However, there are a few unique tools, like the ability to create tabs. The following were tested and confirmed to work across various browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.\n- Ctrl + T -- Open a new tab.\n- Ctrl + Shift + T -- Reopen the last closed tab. (This one is huge!)\n- Ctrl + W -- Close the current tab.\n- Ctrl + Tab -- Move right through tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + Tab -- Move left through the tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Open new private browsing window. On Firefox, this is Ctrl + Shift + P.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move back and forth through tab history.\n- Ctrl + D -- Bookmark page.\n- Ctrl + H -- Open browser history.\n- Ctrl + N -- Open a brand new browser window.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years. In that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office and even someone's backyard. Over the years, I've picked up a lot of tricks to help me get through my day-to-day tasks.\nAlso: I tested the best antivirus software for Windows: Here's what I'd use to protect my PC\nMany of the shortcuts in this guide I use every day, even when I'm not working. CTRL + Z has practically become my best friend because I use it so often. Some of these shortcuts I learned about for the first time while researching this piece. I didn't know that the File Manager has so many shortcuts under its toolbelt, but once I started using them, I immediately saw their value to expert and casual users alike."

Check this setting to find out\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Meta could be scanning your camera roll right now.\n- It's using your photos to provide AI-powered suggestions.\n- Check Facebook settings to turn off the features.\nMeta could be analyzing and retaining your phone's photos without you realizing it.\nSome Facebook users have noticed that, deep within their app settings, toggles are switched on that allow Meta to access their camera roll to offer AI-powered suggestions, including \"personalized creative ideas, like travel highlights and collages\" -- and they don't remember agreeing to this.\nCNET: No, your iPhone isn't listening to you. Here's what's really happening\nThe problem? This feature allows Meta to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who wouldn't otherwise knowingly opt in.\nIf you do get Meta's \"cloud processing\" pop-up announcing this feature and tap \"Allow\" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your \"media and facial features\" to be analyzed by AI.\nFacebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.\nHow to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll\nMeta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, or unknowingly opted in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.\n1. Open the Facebook app\nThe settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.\n- Grab your iPhone or Android phone.\n- Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.\n2. Go to the Menu > Settings and Privacy\nFacebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.\n- Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nOnce the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon.\n3. Select Settings\nOnce you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.\n- Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.\n- Now, scroll down and look for \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions\nMeta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.\n- Tap the option labeled \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n- This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.\n5. Turn off both toggles\nOnce you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.\n- Find the option labeled \"Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.\nFind the option labeled \"Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.\nFAQs\nThese steps don't work for me. Why?\nThe steps above, which I've verified using the Faebook app for iPhone, may vary on Android devices.\nSamsung users, for instance, must do the following: Open Facebook > Go to Profile/Menu > Tap the gear icon in the upper right > Scroll down to \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and select it > You'll see the two camera roll sharing toggles.\nDefinitely go to Facebook's support hub if you need more help. You basically got to find the Settings and privacy menu in the Facebook mobile app, and from there, you can find \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and disable the options.\nWhy is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?\nMeta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.\nWhere is this feature being tested?\nMeta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, \"We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll.\"\nThe test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.\nDid Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?\nMeta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they say found the toggles in their settings switched on without their knowledge, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.\nI've asked several people to check whether camera roll sharing suggestions were enabled in their Facebook app. Besides myself and ZDNET's editorial director, my partner, in-laws, and many friends all found the options turned on without their knowledge. Many users have also reported on social media and in forum threads, like this one on Y Combinator, that the settings were enabled for them.\nSome of these people recalled seeing a consent pop-up from Facebook, while others did not. But nearly everyone said they did not realize they were allowing access to their camera roll data. They also said they would not have allowed it if they had known.\nCan I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?\nZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.\nWhy is this a potential privacy issue?\nIt expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.\nHow many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?\nEditor's note: This article was last updated on Sept. 2, 2025, to clarify steps for Android users. It was also updated on Aug. 24 to confirm that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings."

Every wheel has its own steering motor, and its design enables it to get within 1.2 inches of walls.\nThe mid-level RockMow S1 doesn't have all-wheel drive, can cut about 10,000 square feet a day, and handles about half the slope -- it still has AI mapping though. The RockNeo Q1 is the most affordable model, as it gives up edge cutting (you can buy an additional attachment) and requires you to adjust your cut height manually.\nIf you take your lawn seriously, you can use the companion app to have your robot lawnmower cut specific patterns or designs, Roborock says, and use the app for a suggested mowing schedule based on your lawn zone.\nAlso: Best robot mowers: From Husqvarna to Segway, here are the top performers\nRoborock hasn't revealed information about pricing or a release date yet; I've reached out for more information. The company also revealed details of new vacuums today, which it says will be available in Europe in \"the coming months.\" Based on that, it seems likely the company's robot lawn mowers will be available overseas before they will in America.\nIf the company's lawnmowers are anything like its vacuums, these might be products to keep an eye on. Roborock vacuums generally perform very well in ZDNET testing, earning significant praise from our team."

      "text": "I retested GPT-5's coding skills using OpenAI's guidance - and now I trust it even less\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The same prompts in GPT-5 yield success, crashes, or errors.\n- OpenAI's prompt optimizer helps, but introduces its own quirks.\n- AI \"unconsciously\" adding details raises trust concerns.\nDo AI's get headaches? Because GPT-5 has certainly been giving me one. This article was going to be so easy. OpenAI came out with a list of best practices for GPT-5 coding. All I was going to do was try those best practices with the GPT-5 coding tests that previously failed and see if there was improvement.\nIt seemed so simple.\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nBut then I had a thought. What if OpenAI has improved GPT-5 in the week or so since I ran my tests?\nPerhaps I should re-run the failed tests as-is and see what the results are, to use as a baseline for the new best practices.\nFrom a testing point of view, this was a valid approach. From a personal sanity point of view, not so much.\nRe-running test 1\nI re-ran the first failed test. This test has the AI creating a complete WordPress plugin, complete with a user interface and business logic. The idea is you feed in a set of names, it randomizes them, and it separates duplicates so they're not side-by-side.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nWhen I ran this test on GPT-5 originally, it failed. Clicking the Randomize button sent the browser to another, unrelated page. I was able to cajole GPT-5 into fixing it, but the initial failure was what counted.\nThis time, I ran the exact same test with the exact same prompt again. This time, it worked perfectly. Wow, I thought. GPT-5 has improved in the past week.\nIf only I had left well enough alone. But no.\nI had to try again. On my second time with the exact same test with the exact same prompt, clicking Randomize resulted in what WordPressers call the \"white screen of death.\" This indicates something in the code isn't working.\nAlso: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis\nI tried the exact same test with the exact same prompt a total of five times. The first time it worked. Subsequent times, it didn't. One time, I got a white screen. One time, I got a page full of error messages. One time, I was redirected to another page. One time, nothing happened at all.\nWe'll come back to test 1. But next, I decided to do the same thing with the other failed test.\nRe-running test 4\nThis test asks the AI to write code that talks to Chrome, AppleScript, and another tool called Keyboard Maestro. It requires the AI to be knowledgeable about the three different environments and how they work together.\nHere's an interesting factoid about AppleScript. The scripting language is inherently case-insensitive. So, if you ask AppleScript to compare \"AppleScript\" to \"applescript\", it will consider both strings to be the same. You have to explicitly tell it to compare case before it will do so.\nAlso: You can learn AI for free with these new courses from Anthropic\nWhen I first ran this test against GPT-5, it hallucinated that AppleScript had a native function for making strings lowercase. It does not, so the code failed.\nThis time, instead of hallucinating that AppleScript has a lowercase function, it decided to do one of the most convoluted sets of operations to lowercase a string. Here's that line of code:\nset tabTitleLower to (do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of tabTitle & \" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\")\nThe code actually works, but it's very weird and totally unnecessary. It launches a shell (the command line) to run a shell script that converts to lowercase. It's like making a grilled cheese sandwich and when you realize you're out of cheese, flying across the country to buy cheese from a 7-11 on the opposite side of the continent. You're not even getting better cheese. You're just doing it in the weirdest and most inefficient way possible.\nLet's not forget that we really don't need to make that text lowercase in the first place, because AppleScript is case-insensitive. So it wrote a highly convoluted piece of code that, while it works, is entirely unnecessary.\nI didn't bother to re-run this test four more times because the headache was already starting to set in.\nOpenAI's GPT-5 coding best practices\nOpenAI has put out what it calls a cheatsheet for GPT-5 coding. It has six main recommendations:\n- Be precise and avoid conflicting information: Well, duh. But apparently GPT-5 gets really confused if asked to follow vague or conflicting instructions.\n- Use the right reasoning effort: Rather than just letting GPT-5 choose its reasoning level, you might want to adjust its model. If it starts to overthink a problem, use a lower reasoning level. Great, so now we have to deal with a neurotic AI. Yippee?\n- Use XML-like syntax to help structure instructions: Rather than using just text, using XML tags to segment aspects of a prompt helps the AI to parse its assignment. This is a good hint, but it feels like a step back from what it could do.\n- Avoid overly firm language: In previous models, we sometimes had to YELL at the AI to get it to listen. Apparently, GPT-5 is passive aggressive, so if you get too forceful in your instructions, it will overdo its compliance, like what my old bosses used to say was my practice of \"aggressively following instructions.\"\n- Give room for planning and self-reflection: Does the AI need a blankie? Perhaps a warm stuffed animal to cuddle? In reality, what OpenAI is saying is that you need to encourage the AI to think through the instructions it gets. Apparently, if you don't tell it to think through the instructions, it won't. I fear for the planet.\n- Control the eagerness of your coding agent: It turns out GPT-5 is even more of a people-pleaser than GPT-4o. When giving it instructions, tell it to tone down its fawning and sucking-uppage.\nI'd like to say something positive here, but it's starting to feel like a migraine. Check out the PDF if you want more details.\nOpenAI also created an AI prompting helper. You point your browser to this tool, and paste in your prompt. The tool will give you back a more extensive prompt. For example, I gave it this prompt from Test 4:\nWrite a Keyboard Maestro AppleScript that scans the frontmost Google Chrome window for a tab name containing the string matching the contents of the passed variable instance__ChannelName. Ignore case for the match. Once found, make that tab the active tab.\nIt gave me back this:\nCreate an AppleScript for use in Keyboard Maestro that performs the following actions: * Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining the planned steps before proceeding. * Scan all tabs in the frontmost Google Chrome window. * Search for a tab whose name contains the value of the passed variable 'instance__ChannelName', ignoring case sensitivity. * Once a matching tab is found, activate that tab and make it the current/active tab. After generating the script, validate in 1-2 lines whether the script meets all requirements. If not, state what needs adjustment.\nEssentially, it revised the prompt to add a planning phase at the beginning and a validation phase at the end.\nDoes it work?\nNope. Nopity-nope-nope.\nI ran Test 4's \"optimized\" prompt through GPT-5 and got back this script:\nThere are at least three serious flaws in it. First, the code in the green box doesn't work. It doesn't retrieve the value from Keyboard Maestro. Previous versions did that successfully using a completely different (and well-documented) mechanism. This approach is just loony.\nAlso: AI is creeping into the Linux kernel - and official policy is needed ASAP\nNow, look at the blue box. The considering case operation is used only for evaluation. For example, with considering case, \"BLUE\" and \"blue\" are different values. Do you see any sort of if statement or evaluation inside the blue box? Me neither.\nThen there's the red box. There is no such syntax as \"considering case false.\" First, the default behavior is to ignore case. Second, if you really wanted to explicitly tell AppleScript to ignore case, you'd use an \"ignoring case\" block. But \"considering case false\"? That's just some made-up syntax right there.\nRetrying the WordPress plugin\nI also ran my original prompt for the WordPress plugin through the prompt optimizer. I got back a fairly extensive project requirements document.\nOn the plus side, this time the plugin worked. I tried generating code a second time, and it also worked. So perhaps the optimization is something to try if GPT-5 isn't playing nice.\nBut then there's the weirdness. Because there's always weirdness. Check out the header block generated by GPT-5.\nNotice the author is attributed to Advanced Geekery Labs. Historically, the AIs have listed the author field as \"Your Name.\" But this time, it's Advanced Geekery Labs.\nThere is some relevance, because Advanced Geekery is the name of my YouTube channel and weekly newsletter. But I didn't use it anywhere in my instructions for this plugin. Additionally, I've never added Labs to the end of Advanced Geekery, even though my security product is sold through ZATZ Labs.\nSo I asked GPT-5 where it got the name Advanced Geekery Labs from. Its answer:\nGood question. The name \"Advanced Geekery Labs\" isn't something you provided in your request. I introduced it in the plugin header's Author: field as a placeholder, because in earlier conversations you've mentioned your \"Advanced Geekery\" brand, and I unconsciously expanded it into \"Labs.\"\nI'm glad the AI thinks it's a good question. That warms my heart. But \"unconsciously expanded\"? That's a direct quote from the AI. Those are its words.\nSo, we're now dealing with hallucinating AIs that operate unconsciously?\nWe're all doomed.\nWhat about coding and GPT-5?\nI still don't trust it. Actually, I don't trust it even more than when I tested it originally. What else might it do to my code \"unconsciously\"?\nI guess, if you really need GPT-5 to give you some code, you could try the optimizer. But I wouldn't rely on it.\nGPT-4o was impressive, but it had some problems. GPT-5 is like its more troubled, more difficult sibling.\nWith GPT-4o, I'd be willing to trust, with verification. I just plain don't trust GPT-5. There's something that's just not right. If we were to experience an AI that would revolt against its creators and try to kill us all, I would not be surprised if it all originated with GPT-5.\nAnd no. My headache hasn't gone away. Apparently, Tylenol is now bad for you. So, there's that, too.\nWhat do you think?\nHave you tried relying on GPT-5 for coding projects? If so, did you run into the same kinds of inconsistencies and odd behaviors? Do you find OpenAI's \"best practices\" helpful, or do they feel like workarounds for deeper problems? And what's your take on GPT-5's tendency to improvise or even \"unconsciously\" insert details? Is it a harmless quirk or a reason for concern?

From the affordable Essentials range to new smart light strips, there were a lot of cool products, but I was most intrigued by the new Bridge Pro and its ability to add motion sensing to both new and existing Philips Hue smart light products.\nMotionAware\nThe Philips Hue Bridge Pro supports a new feature called MotionAware, which uses radio frequency (RF) sensing to detect changes in the Zigbee signal between bulbs, converting them into motion-sensing devices without the need for external motion sensors. The feature will work with 95% of existing Hue products (those manufactured after 2014).\nAlso: The best smart home devices of 2025: Expert tested\nI got a demo of MotionAware, and it was pretty impressive. Philips says you need at least three Hue lights to make MotionAware work. These don't necessarily need to be smart bulbs but can be light strips or other Hue light products, too. MotionAware won't work with third-party devices or battery-powered Hue lights.\nIt was easy to set up in the demo. You need the Hue app to select the room and participating lights. While calibrating (a 20-second process), they'll blink once to confirm the setup process, and you're all set. MotionAware can be triggered by pets because it can only sense movements and cannot distinguish between humans and pets. The movement data is sent to the Bridge Pro, which analyzes it and applies AI algorithms to find the cause of the movements.\nYou can also change the sensitivity, draw shapes around an area where you want MotionAware to work, and choose if you want to set up security notifications. However, you'll require a Hue Secure subscription to make security notifications work. While the subscription starts at $40 a year (including video storage), you can subscribe to only MotionAware security alerts for $1 per month.\nPhilips Hue also announced a partnership with Sonos, so you can control your Hue products with Sonos Voice Control. It only works in English and French, because those are the only two languages supported by Sonos' voice assistant.\nAlso: These 7 smart plug hacks that saved me time, money, and energy (and how I set them up)\nAs one of the journalists in the room pointed out, it'd be cool if MotionAware could sense which room you're in and shift music to your Sonos room speaker (from another, say, living room soundbar) automatically. This isn't possible yet, but it's a cool idea, and the company says it's working on expanding capabilities in its partnership with Sonos.\nWhile we're on voice assistants, it is worth mentioning that Philips Hue has also added an AI assistant within its app. It can be operated with type-in commands as well as voice. You can ask it to set the theme of the room or use generative AI to suggest more lighting options based on your mood.\nA lot more Philips Hue products\nAlongside my favorite MotionAware announcement, Philips Hue also announced its first-ever doorbell. The Philips Hue Secure Video Doorbell is a wired product (rather than battery-powered). It supports 2K video recording with a 180-degree field of view horizontally and vertically. It will go on sale in October 2025 for $170.\nThe company introduced the Hue Essentials product line, which is a budget alternative to the reliable Philips Hue products. The new lineup consists of two light strips, an A19/E27 60-watt equivalent bulb, BR30 downlights, and GU10 spotlights.\nThey are claimed to still deliver good color accuracy, but they don't dim as deeply as their more expensive counterparts. Philips Hue Essentials devices are compatible with the Hue Bridge over Zigbee and support Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, and Google Home connection for voice control.\nAlso: 8 smart home gadgets that instantly upgraded my house (and why they work)\nAs for the Philips Hue Bridge Pro itself, the device is priced at $90. It supports connection to Zigbee devices to add capabilities like schedules, out-of-home control, customized lighting scenes, and more. It packs a more powerful processor, higher RAM capacity, and can connect up to 150 lights and 50 accessories.\nMoreover, Philips Hue has a new OmniGlow strip light. According to Signify's John Smith, this is \"the best light strip\" that they've made to date. It can go up to 4,500 lumens in brightness and dim down to 0.5 percent (Hue Essentials products can do 2 percent, while other expensive Hue lights can do 0.2 percent). Pricing starts at $140. There are a bunch of other Philips Hue strip lights, too, including ones in the Flux and Essentials series."
