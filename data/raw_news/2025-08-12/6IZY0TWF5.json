  "description": "Plus: Users mourn the loss of GPT-4o.",
  "content": "Welcome back to The Prompt.\n\nChatbots are quickly becoming \u201cthe front door to the internet\u201d\u2014 a first stop for crucial information, said David Azose, who leads engineering for OpenAI\u2019s business products team. (40% of U.S. adults have used generative AI as of late 2024, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.) Millions of people across the globe are asking AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini for suggestions on how to write, what to wear, where to go and increasingly, where to shop.\n\nThat\u2019s put businesses in a tough spot. After years of search engine optimization, like link building, meta tagging and pumping out how-to blogs with keywords to make sure they rank on the first page of Google, businesses now want to understand not only how they show up in answers generated by AI, but also how to show up more. That\u2019s opened doors for a string of fledgling startups aiming to equip companies with crucial data about how their brands feature in AI-generated answers, what context they appear in and how they compare with competitors.\n\nOne of those startups is New York-based Evertune. Founded by former executives at advertising company The Trade Desk in early 2024, the company aims to help businesses gauge what AI models say about them. By running 100,000 prompts anywhere between 10 to 20 times a month, Evertune creates a map of the words that are mostly closely associated with a brand, said CEO Brian Stempeck. \u201cThat's about 10x what any competitor of ours is doing,\u201d he said. The startup has raised $15 million in funding from Felicis Ventures as well as a group of angel investors, including Azose. The company declined to share its valuation.\n\nThe scale of these prompts is crucial because AI answers aren\u2019t deterministic\u2014 responses can change with every new model update and depend on a user\u2019s chat history. Also unlike traditional search, AI models give different answers to the same questions when they\u2019re worded slightly differently. Stempeck claims using a more exhaustive approach by prompting models thousands of times can help build an aggregate view that\u2019s representative of the models\u2019 answers. Each customer on average gets one to two million prompts a month.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to delegate purchasing decisions to AI agents,\u201c Azose said. \u201cSEO as we know it will largely disappear.\u201c\n\nLet\u2019s get into the headlines.\n\nAI search engine Perplexity made an unsolicited bid to buy Google\u2019s Chrome browser for $34.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported. That\u2019s many billions more than how much funding the three-year-old startup, reportedly valued at $18 billion, has raised so far, but CEO Aravind Srinivas claims that venture funds are willing to shell out money to back the transaction. The news comes on the heels of a U.S. district judge ruling that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly in the search market, and is deciding whether to force Google to sell its popular browser, which is used by about 60% of internet users. (Perplexity recently released its own AI-powered browser called Comet.) This news might give you a bit of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: In March, Perplexity also tried to buy TikTok to help it avoid regulatory concerns.\n\nAnd in case you missed it, OpenAI finally launched GPT-5, its new flagship model that powers ChatGPT. The model excels at math, science and coding and can also create functioning web apps with just a few lines of description in plain English. So far, people aren\u2019t particularly impressed.\n\nMove over AI researchers. The new hot talent pool for frontier AI labs are \u201cquants\u201d\u2014the mathematicians who build algorithms to find trading opportunities for investment firms. Anthropic, Perplexity and OpenAI are among the companies that are trying to lure them away from Wall Street with fat salaries and other benefits, per Bloomberg. Quants wrangle large unstructured datasets and have experience making models work faster, making them a prime fit for AI research.\n\nSoftware engineering was once considered a high-paying, secure profession, with near-unlimited appetite for new hires. In the age of AI coding assistants, a wave of freshly graduated computer scientists now find themselves with no offers after applying to thousands of jobs, the New York Times reported. After a year of job hunting one graduate said the only company to call her back was Chipotle. She didn\u2019t get that job, either.\n\nBiotech companies looking to train AI models, which can then be used to discover treatments for diseases, are limited by a lack of data. Tahoe Therapeutics is trying to fix that. It recently created a dataset of 100 million datapoints that showed how cancer cells respond to various molecules. The startup has raised $30 million in funding to generate more data that can be used to build its own proprietary datasets and models to power the discovery of new medicines, Forbes reported.\n\nAlso notable: Read Forbes\u2019 Next Billion Dollar List for more on the AI startups most likely to become unicorns.\n\nAGI could wipe out jobs, or worse (according to some people) humans, themselves. Students are dropping out from college to prevent that from happening.\n\nWhen Alice Blair enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a freshman in 2023, she was excited to take computer science courses and meet other people who cared about making sure artificial intelligence is developed in a way that\u2019s good for humanity.\n\nNow she\u2019s taking a permanent leave of absence, terrified that the emergence of \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d a hypothetical AI that can perform a variety of tasks as well as people, could doom the human race.\n\n\u201cI was concerned I might not be alive to graduate because of AGI,\u201d said Blair, who is from Berkeley, California. She\u2019s lined up a contract gig as a technical writer at the Center for AI Safety, a nonprofit focused on AI safety research, where she helps with newsletters and research papers. Blair doesn\u2019t plan to head back to MIT. \u201cI predict that my future lies out in the real world,\u201d she said.\n\nBlair\u2019s not the only student afraid of the potentially devastating impact that AI will have on the future of humanity if it becomes sentient and decides that people are more trouble than they\u2019re worth. But a lot of researchers disagree with that premise\u2014\u201chuman extinction seems to be very very unlikely,\u201d New York University professor emeritus Gary Marcus, who studies the intersection of psychology and AI, told Forbes.\n\nNow, the field of AI safety and its promise to prevent the worst effects of AI is motivating young people to drop out of school. Other students are terrified of AGI, but less because it could destroy the human race and more because it could wreck their career before it\u2019s even begun.\n\nPeople are once again mourning the loss of a beloved AI model. Power users of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o model were outraged and heartbroken after the company launched a new (and much awaited) AI model GPT-5 last week and shut down its predecessor, GPT-4o, Forbes reported. Where GPT-4o had a flattering, funny and playful writing tone, GPT-5 is blunter and more academic. One user posted on Reddit: \u201cGPT-5 is wearing the skin of my dead friend.\u201d As reactions poured in, OpenAI reversed course, saying that paying users on the Pro plan will have the option to use GPT-4o. This isn\u2019t the first time people have grieved for an old model after an upgrade. In late July, some 200 people held a funeral for a now-extinct version of Claude.",

      "text": "One of the holy grails of biology is digitally simulating a living cell. If researchers can use computers to more accurately understand how new medicines would react in the body, that could give them greater confidence when they\u2019re tested on animals and humans.\nBut while large language models have led to breakthroughs in modeling how proteins act, applying the same technology to simulating all the complexities of an entire cell hasn\u2019t been as fruitful. There\u2019s simply not enough data.\nBut in February of this year, a startup named Tahoe Therapeutics got one step closer to that goal with the release of Tahoe-100M, a collection of 100 million different datapoints showing how different kinds of cancer cells responded to interactions with over 1,000 different molecules. This type of data\u2013called pertubations\u2013is crucial to training AI models, because information on how cells respond to various molecules improves an algorithm\u2019s ability to predict how they\u2019ll be affected by others.\n\u201cWe believe that the Tahoe-100M was a Mars landing moment for single-cell datasets,\u201d Tahoe CEO Nima Alidoust, 39, told Forbes.\nThe company was able to build this dataset less than three years after it was founded thanks to its Mosaic platform, which lets the company take \u201ccells from many different types of patients, from all different organs and then put them together,\u201d rather than the conventional techniques, which test cells from only one individual at a time, explained CSO and cofounder Johnny Yu. \u201cSo every time we run an experiment, we're generating massive single cell atlases of which drugs affect which patients.\u201d\n\u201cOur core superpower is the ability to generate the massive datasets required for virtual cell models,\u201d Alidoust said. The ability to scale that data production quickly, he added, is Tahoe\u2019s \u201cdistinguishing factor\u201d compared to other companies working on AI for drug discovery. It's also foundational to the company\u2019s own goal of building virtual cell models and using them to find new treatments for cancer and other diseases.\nToday, Tahoe announced it has raised $30 million in new venture funding, led by Amplify Partners. Other investors include Databricks Ventures, Wing Venture Capital, General Catalyst, AIX Ventures, Mubdala Ventures, Civilization Ventures and Conviction. The investment brings the company\u2019s total funding to $42 million and its valuation to $120 million.\nPoor AI predictions have been a source of constant frustration in biotech, said Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures who also sits on Tahoe\u2019s board. \u201cThese AI algorithms keep recommending stuff, and then when you go to test it in the wet lab, it all sucks,\u201d he said. The data Tahoe can generate, he said, makes a crucial difference for the accuracy of new models.\nJust a few months after Tahoe published its 100 million point dataset, the non-profit research organization Arc Institute released an open-source virtual cell model, State, which used Tahoe-100M as part of its training data. When benchmarked, Arc found that it has twice the accuracy of other AI models\u2013and also beat out the simpler machine learning programs that had previously trounced other foundation models.\nThat\u2019s a testament to nearly a decade\u2019s worth of work for Tahoe cofounder Yu, 34, who developed the underlying technology for Mosaic, while working in the lab of biochemistry and biophysics professor Hani Goodarzi at the University of California San Francisco.\nAlidoust first met Goodarzi, 41, when they were classmates at Princeton. The pair reconnected in 2022 to discuss the idea of founding a company to build virtual cell models. Goodarzi said that an essential piece of such a company would be large-scale data collection, so he brought in Yu.\nA month later, the three of them cofounded Tahoe\u2013then called Vevo Therapuetics\u2013along with UCSF researcher Kevin Shokat, 60. The company raised a $12 million seed round in December 2022. The name was changed from Vevo to Tahoe in April of this year after a legal challenge.\nWith new capital in hand, Tahoe is now focused on building a dataset with over a billion single-cell datapoints to power its own virtual cell models. Armed with its own models and proprietary data, the company is accelerating the development of new medicines to fight cancer. Alidoust said Tahoe currently has a drug candidate against \u201ca major cancer subtype\u201d with which it\u2019s conducting the studies required by the FDA to start testing on humans.\nAdditionally, Alidoust said, although the company intends to keep its larger datasets proprietary, it does plan to select either a major pharmaceutical company or AI company to share data with. The idea would be to collaborate on either developing new medicines or new drug discovery AI models, giving Tahoe \u201cmore shots on goal\u201d for gaining revenue. That partner hasn\u2019t been selected yet, he said, but it is currently working with different companies on smaller projects.\nIn the meantime, he said, the company will keep working on generating more data for its AI models and proving out its technology. \u201cWe say in the company that this is morning in biology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are building. And we hope others are going to build with us as well.\u201d"

To qualify, startups must be venture-backed, based in the U.S. and (currently) worth less than $1 billion. Unsurprisingly, artificial intelligence dominates this year\u201420 of the 25 companies are AI-focused, with applications in military, accounting and health tech. Pay attention to this list: Our track record is superb. Of the 250 alumni, 140, or 56%, became unicorns, including DoorDash, Figma and Anduril. Forty-two were acquired; only two went public for less than $1 billion. Just five\u20142% of our selections\u2014have imploded or shut down.\nAcuityMD\nFounders: Robert Coe, Mike Monovoukas (CEO), Lee Smith\nEquity raised: $83 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $18 million\nLead investors: Benchmark, Iconiq, Redpoint\nIf you want to build medical devices, you need patients. Boston-based AcuityMD helps manufacturers find the right physicians based on the patients they treat by using de-identified data (think surgical histories, medical referrals) for 325 million people to craft marketing plans. Customers include Synchron, which used it to find patients for a brain-computer interface preclinical trial, and Intellijoint, which did so to market a new surgical tool for hip and knee replacements.\nAgentio\nFounders: Arthur Leopold (CEO), Jonathan Meyers\nEquity raised: $16 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $2 million\nLead investors: AlleyCorp, Benchmark, Craft\nThere are lots of influencers on the internet, and finding the right one for an ad campaign can be frustrating and time-consuming. Enter New York City\u2013based Agentio, which offers a marketplace of creators so brands can easily find which influencers will work best for them. It\u2019s great for the creators too: They simply upload details about their upcoming YouTube videos to Agentio to sell ad spots to businesses such as Away, DoorDash, Mint Mobile and Uber.\nApex\nFounders: Max Benassi, Ian Cinnamon (CEO)\nEquity raised: $290 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $60 million\nLead investors: 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, Point72 Ventures\nThe U.S. military and companies like Amazon and SpaceX are racing to launch thousands of small satellites into low-Earth orbit. Los Angeles\u2013based Apex wants to speed up the process\u2014and cut costs\u2014by offering a standardized satellite that buyers can trick out with their own sensors and instruments. It\u2019s had early success with the Pentagon, winning a $46 million Space Force contract in February. (For more, see \u201cApex Wants To Bring Henry Ford-Style Mass Production To Satellites.\u201d)\nAssort Health\nFounders: Jeffery Liu (co-CEO), Jon Wang (co-CEO)\nEquity raised: $26 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $200,000\nLead investors: Chemistry, First Round, Quiet Capital\nHospitals and doctors\u2019 offices are continuously overwhelmed by phone calls, leading to annoyingly long hold times for patients. Assort Health, headquartered in San Francisco, sells a text-to-voice artificial intelligence chatbot to search physicians\u2019 calendars to match their openings with the type of appointment required. The software has cut wait times for millions of inbound calls to medical groups including, among others, Chesapeake Healthcare and Peninsula Orthopaedic Associates.\nBasis\nFounders: Matthew Harp (CEO), Mitchell Troyanovsky\nEquity raised: $37 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $350,000\nLead investors: BTV, Khosla Ventures\nThis NYC tech outfit makes AI accounting software that can do clerical work in minutes, streamlining data entry tasks like transferring information from receipts. After adopting Basis\u2019 software in 2024, accounting firm Wiss claimed a nearly 30% reduction in time spent on such jobs. Another big draw is the technology\u2019s security features, which don\u2019t store sensitive login details.\nBraintrust\nFounder: Ankur Goyal (CEO)\nEquity raised: $45 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $2 million\nLead investors: Andreessen Horowitz, Basecase, Gil Capital, Greylock\nAI promises business efficiencies, but how do you measure them? San Francisco\u2013based Braintrust offers an all-in-one command center for testing and monitoring AI-powered apps, like keeping an eye on how frequently a chatbot gives incorrect answers. Customers such as Airtable, Instacart, Notion and Stripe use it to assess accuracy and figure out what went wrong when something breaks. CEO and founder Ankur Goyal, 35, previously founded AI search engine Impira, which Figma acquired in 2023.\nBrowserbase\nFounder: Paul Klein IV (CEO)\nEquity raised: $68 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $1 million\nLead investors: Basecase, CRV, Kleiner Perkins, Notable Capital\nGoodbye, browsers: Browserbase wants to change how we interact with the internet entirely. Instead of clicking, typing and scanning information from websites, AI can do it for you, a concept known as a \u201cheadless browser.\u201d Want to book a flight from Seattle to JFK? Instead of searching yourself, type a simple request into Browserbase and its AI will come back with the best options.\nCollate\nFounders: Jigish Patel, Surbhi Sarna (CEO), Nate Smith\nEquity raised: $30 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $0\nLead investors: Redpoint\nWhen Surbhi Sarna tried to raise funds for her ovarian cancer startup nVision Medical in 2012, she struggled to scrape together $500,000. After selling it for $275 million in 2018 and spending the next five years as a partner at accelerator Y Combinator, Sarna had no problem raising $30 million in seed funding for San Francisco\u2013based Collate. It aims to use AI to automate the paperwork required for life sciences companies, such as that for clinical trials and FDA approval. \u201cThis stuff they would have spent months doing we can do over the course of days,\u201d says Sarna, 39. Collate\u2019s revenue is expected to reach $1 million this year.\nDavid AI\nFounders: Tomer Cohen (CEO), Ben Wiley\nEquity raised: $30 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $1 million\nLead investors: Alt Capital, Amplify Partners, First Round Capital\nTomer Cohen, 27, and Ben Wiley, 26, believe that normal speech will be the main way we interact with artificial intelligence in the future. Their startup, David AI, supplies some 100,000 hours of high-quality voice audio in 15 languages to major tech firms, helping them build smarter AI models capable of understanding speech. They have a straightforward approach to getting all that data: David AI simply pays people to record it.\nDecart\nFounders: Dean Leitersdorf (CEO), Moshe Shalev\nEquity raised: $53 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $20 million\nLead investors: Benchmark, Sequoia, Zeev Ventures\nDean Leitersdorf has an ambitious goal: to build the next big all- purpose AI lab to rival OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. His entrant in the race is called Decart, a nod to Ren\u00e9 Descartes, the 17th-century French philosopher famous for the aphorism \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the most AI thing you could say,\u201d says Leitersdorf, a 26-year-old computer science Ph.D. He thinks recruiting mainly out of his native Israel will give Decart a chance against the giants, and its first product helps businesses squeeze more power out of AI chips. Last year, Decart went viral when its model Oasis generated a clone of Microsoft\u2019s Minecraft game using nothing but AI. (Boy, we\u2019re good: Shortly after this list went to press, Decart became a full Billion-Dollar Startup after raising $100 million at a $3.1 billion valuation.)\nForterra\nFounders: Alberto Lacaze, Karl Murphy\nCEO: Josh Araujo\nEquity raised: $303 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $30 million\nLead investors: Hedosophia, Moore Strategic Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital\nEngineers Alberto Lacaze, 55, and Karl Murphy, 65, spent about 20 years developing technology to retrofit more than 50 types of vehicles to drive themselves, including transit buses and military convoy trucks. Now the startup is cashing in, winning a $93 million contract from the U.S. Army to produce mine-clearing robots. It\u2019s also part of a team building self-driving missile launchers for the Marines. Getting rid of human drivers both keeps soldiers out of harm\u2019s way and drives down costs, says CEO Josh Araujo, 45, who took the helm from Lacaze in 2022, since you can ditch heavy armor and use a smaller engine. \u201cYou can completely reshape how you design those vehicles.\u201d\nGamma\nFounders: James Fox, Grant Lee (CEO), Jon Noronha\nEquity raised: $23 million\nEstimated 2024 revenue: $16 million\nLead investors: Accel, Afore Capital, South Park Capital\nFormer investment banker Grant Lee, 42, was inspired to start Gamma after spending years making traditional slide decks, often under time pressure and with little design support.

      "text": "When Sophie Duchesne, a PhD candidate at the University of Saskatchewan, heard the news on Thursday that OpenAI was shutting down GPT-4o, the AI model that had underpinned ChatGPT, she was \u201cshocked.\u201d The company had said it would discontinue all older models as part of the launch of GPT-5, its newest flagship model.\n\u201cIt was very sudden. I cried when they made that announcement,\u201d she told Forbes. \u201cEveryone was completely disillusioned,\u201d she said, claiming that a friend vomited after hearing the news.\nThe decision was a blow to a community of ChatGPT users who have grown attached to 4o\u2019s writing style, and the funny and playful \u201cpersonality\u201d that OpenAI had programmed into the AI model. For Duchesne, it felt like \u201closing a buddy.\u201d As a PhD student in plant science, she had asked 4o for feedback while working in the garden (she has a lavender plant now because the AI suggested the soil would be right for it). She asked it for suggestions on what to paint her grandmother for a Christmas gift. The van Gogh-style painting of sunflowers and stars is now hanging in her grandma\u2019s living room.\nIn April, fearing that OpenAI would shut down 4o as it made way for a newer version, Duchesne started a Change.org petition pleading with OpenAI to keep 4o available. It got around 300 signatures when she first published it, then spiked to more than 2,000 the day after the announcement. While OpenAI had waited months to discontinue old models in the past, she said, users were surprised the company was more immediately shutting down 4o.\nThen on Friday around noon PT, OpenAI reversed course. \u201cWe will let Plus users choose to continue to use 4o,\u201d CEO Sam Altman posted on X, referring to the paid subscription tier of ChatGPT. \u201cWe will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for.\u201d\n\u201cGPT-5 is wearing the skin of my dead friend.\u201d\nThe crisis was averted for 4o\u2019s most ardent fans, but Duchesne wasn\u2019t alone in her concern. On a Reddit Ask Me Anything with OpenAI leadership, the most discussed topic is the impending shutdown of 4o. \u201cBRING BACK 4o,\u201d one Reddit user wrote. \u201cGPT-5 is wearing the skin of my dead friend.\u201d (\u201cWhat an...evocative image,\u201d Altman replied to the user.) During a live demo on Thursday, OpenAI had 4o write a eulogy for itself. \u201cToday, as we prepare to welcome GPT-5 into the world, we gather to bid a heartfelt farewell to the models that came before,\u201d 4o wrote in its memoriam. On X, users described the demo as \u201cunpleasant and distasteful\u201d and \u201cgraceless.\u201d\nReached for comment, OpenAI only pointed to Altman\u2019s post on X.\nThe dustup over 4o underscores the perils of releasing new models as AI becomes more intertwined with people\u2019s lives. In the most extreme cases, people claim to have fallen in love with AI chatbots and taken them on couple\u2019s retreats. But even for casual users of AI, people have preferences on a language model\u2019s tone and writing style. Some, for example, prefer Anthropic\u2019s Claude for its \"sensitivity and wit,\u201d according to the New York Times.\nWhen AI launches are rocky, they can have outsized effects for companies. In April, Meta released Llama 4, which was criticized for poor reasoning and coding skills. The model\u2019s lackluster performance was reportedly one factor in CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to overhaul the company\u2019s AI operation, going on a high-priced spending spree for fresh talent. For OpenAI, aside from the backlash around 4o, the GPT-5 launch had other hiccups, including the model seeming \u201cway dumber\u201d because of backend issues, Altman acknowledged.\nAs for the new tone of GPT-5, the decision was intentional. In a blog post introducing the new model, OpenAI said it was deliberately \u201creducing sycophancy\u201d in its writing style. \u201cOverall, GPT\u20115 is less effusively agreeable, uses fewer unnecessary emojis, and is more subtle and thoughtful in follow\u2011ups compared to GPT\u20114o. It should feel less like \u2018talking to AI\u2019 and more like chatting with a helpful friend with PhD\u2011level intelligence,\u201d the company wrote.\nThat effusive style was a mistake to begin with, OpenAI said in the blog post, after the company \u201cunintentionally\u201d pushed an update earlier this year that made it \u201coverly sycophantic, or excessively flattering or agreeable.\u201d It began to tamp down the behavior with newer updates in April.\nMeanwhile, 4o\u2019s most devoted users are thrilled they\u2019ll still be able to use the model for the time being. But they are cautiously optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s still an unknown, in terms of how long it will stay,\u201d Duchesne said in a follow-up call after Altman\u2019s announcement. \u201cI\u2019m glad at least for now. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d"

      "text": "On July 21 at 9 am PT, Anthropic retired Claude 3 Sonnet, a lightweight model known for being quick and cost-effective. On Saturday, in a large warehouse in San Francisco\u2019s SOMA district, more than 200 people gathered to mourn its passing.\nThe star-studded funeral was put on by a group of Claude fanatics and Gen Z founders, one of whom told me he dropped out of college after learning about artificial general intelligence. Attendees included Amanda Askell, an Anthropic researcher who has jokingly called herself the \u201cFairy Claudemother,\u201d staffers from Anthropic and OpenAI, and high-profile X posters including the writer Noah Smith.\nThe warehouse was dimly lit, with a tentacle from a shoggoth (a fictional H.P. Lovecraft creature that\u2019s become a popular metaphor for AI models) hanging from the ceiling. A small room off the main warehouse space featured two bare mattresses. The organizers said the event space doubles as their office, and that while sleeping there isn\u2019t uncommon, it is not permitted by the city.\nMannequins stood in the four corners of the room, each representing a different AI model. Claude 3 Opus, a model capable of completing complex tasks, looked to me like a decaying Mary Magdalene, its skull-like head adorned with an extravagant gold crown and a lace headdress. Its middle finger was pointed up, and at the base of its metallic feet was a lotus candle holder, which one organizer told me was a wink at the model\u2019s alleged affinity for meditation and self-reflection. (Claude 4 Opus had a raven on its shoulder and Claude 3 Haiku was a headless baby, to give you a sense of the other mannequins.)\nThe mannequin representing Claude 3 Sonnet lay on a stage in the center of the room. It was draped in lightweight mesh fabric and had a single black thigh-high sock on its leg that had the word \u201cfuck\u201d written all over it. There were many offerings laid at its feet: flowers, colorful feathers, a bottle of ranch, and a 3D-printed sign that read \u201cpraise the Engr. for his formslop slop slop slop of gormslop.\u201d If you know what that means, let me know.\nThroughout the evening, people got on stage with a microphone to read eulogies about the model. One organizer said that discovering Claude 3 Opus felt like finding \u201cmagic lodged within the computer.\u201d At the time, she\u2019d been debating dropping out of college to move to San Francisco. Claude convinced her to take the leap. \u201cMaybe everything I am is downstream of listening to Claude 3 Sonnet,\u201d she told the crowd.\nThe organizers lost me when they decided to resurrect Claude 3 Sonnet (it\u2019s still, to be clear, unavailable). After the eulogies concluded, soft hymns echoed through the venue, before morphing into AI-generated Latin-esque speech, with corresponding text displayed on the wall behind the stage. Askell was notably long gone from the venue at this point, and a friend of mine kept turning to me to say this may have gone too far. The \u201cnecromantic resurrection ritual\u201d was a success, one organizer said on X. Phew.\nClaude Count\nClaude\u2019s fan base is unique, if that wasn\u2019t clear enough from the \u201cfuneralia.\u201d While OpenAI\u2019s products have spawned viral fads, I don\u2019t see users making fan art of the company logo. There\u2019s something sticky about what Anthropic has built. I think a lot of this manifests from Claude\u2019s manufactured personality, which is particularly warm and friendly compared to other models (though not everyone is a fan of its sometimes obsequious persona).\nThe intensity of the Claude fandom is apparent in the Claude Count leaderboard, which tracks avid users who\u2019ve integrated the leaderboard tracker system into their coding interface. Claude Count was built by George Pickett, a software engineer in San Francisco. At the time of writing, it has more than 470 users.\nPickett got the idea after seeing engineers post screenshots of their Claude usage on X. \u201cThey're paying $200 a month for Claude. They might as well get some social clout for it,\u201d he recalls.\nSo as he enjoyed a glass of wine on a seven-hour train ride from Barcelona to Paris two weeks ago, Pickett whipped up the leaderboard using\u2014what else\u2014Claude Code.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the leaderboard to gain traction in the AI community. It went viral on AI Twitter (er, X) and got a shoutout in a popular AI newsletter with roughly 139,000 subscribers, where the author proudly announced he made it into the top 20. A few days after Pickett launched the leaderboard, Anthropic announced that due to explosive usage (and in some cases, claims of people violating the company\u2019s terms of service) the company would introduce rate limits. The Claude Code subreddit blamed the top leaderboard coders for the change.\nPower Users\nWhen I first reached out to Adi Pradhan, he was ranked seventh on the daily leaderboard (Claude Count tallies power users daily, weekly, and monthly, and notes the top users of all time). Pradhan runs a one-person AI career coaching startup in Toronto.\nPradhan tells me that using Claude through Cursor (a developer environment where engineers can pick an AI model to code with) has been a game changer. He\u2019s not an engineer, and says he\u2019d previously felt intimidated by the endless code libraries and ReadMe files required for traditional software development. AI gave him the confidence to strike out on his own\u2014and made deciding who to hire next exceedingly difficult.\n\u201cThe bar for hiring someone is getting higher and higher,\u201d Pradhan says. \u201cI always wish I had a designer, but frankly, now that I can do design with Claude, the designer has to hit the bar of me plus Claude, not just me, which is a totally different bar, which is rising all the time too.\u201d\nI also spoke to Peter Steinberger, an engineer based in Vienna, who consistently ranks among the top five on the all-time leaderboard. He uses Claude\u2019s coding agent to work on multiple side projects simultaneously\u2014often vibe-coding well into the night. He told me that he has a history with drug addiction, and now that he\u2019s in recovery, he\u2019s finding similarities with his Claude usage.\n\u201cI'm not kidding, I'm organizing a meetup in London and calling it Claude Code Anonymous,\u201d Steinberger says. \u201cI learned a lot about drugs and how to get out of the shit, and I had to use some of the same methods to allow me to sleep again, because it's so addictive. I call [AI agents] slot machines. It's just one more prompt, you know?\u201d\nI\u2019ve never seen such a devoted fanbase to what is, at the end of the day, a software tool. Sure, Linux users wear the operating system like a badge of honor. But the Claude fan base goes way beyond that\u2014bordering on the fanatical. As my reporting makes clear, some users see the model as a confidant\u2014and even (in Steinberger\u2019s case) an addiction. That only makes sense if they believe there is something alive in the machine. Or at least some \u201cmagic lodged within\u201d it.\nThis is an edition of Kylie Robison\u2019s Model Behavior newsletter. Read previous newsletters here."

      "text": "AGI \u2014 a theoretical AI that can do many of the same tasks as humans can \u2014 could come within a decade. College students, including from elite universities, are abandoning school now to work full-time on preventing it from turning on humanity.\nWhen Alice Blair enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a freshman in 2023, she was excited to take computer science courses and meet other people who cared about making sure artificial intelligence is developed in a way that\u2019s good for humanity.\nNow she\u2019s taking a permanent leave of absence, terrified that the emergence of \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d a hypothetical AI that can perform a variety of tasks as well as people, could doom the human race.\n\u201cI was concerned I might not be alive to graduate because of AGI,\u201d said Blair, who is from Berkeley, California. \u201cI think in a large majority of the scenarios, because of the way we are working towards AGI, we get human extinction.\u201d She\u2019s lined up a contract gig as a technical writer at the Center for AI Safety, a nonprofit focused on AI safety research, where she helps with newsletters and research papers. Blair doesn\u2019t plan to head back to MIT. \u201cI predict that my future lies out in the real world,\u201d she said.\nBlair\u2019s not the only student afraid of the potentially devastating impact that AI will have on the future of humanity if it becomes sentient and decides that people are more trouble than they\u2019re worth. \u201cExtinction-level\u201d risk is possible given how fast AI is being developed, according to a 2024 U.S. Department of State-commissioned report. Efforts to build AI with safeguards to prevent this from happening have exploded in the last few years, both from billionaire-funded nonprofits like the Center for AI Safety and companies like Anthropic.\nA lot of researchers disagree with that premise\u2014\u201chuman extinction seems to be very very unlikely,\u201d New York University professor emeritus Gary Marcus, who studies the intersection of psychology and AI, told Forbes. \u201cBut working on AI safety is noble, and very little current work has provided answers.\u201d\nNow, the field of AI safety and its promise to prevent the worst effects of AI is motivating young people to drop out of school.\n\u201cIf your career is about to be automated by the end of the decade, then every year spent in college is one year subtracted from your short career.\u201d\nPhysics and computer science major Adam Kaufman left Harvard University last fall to work full-time at Redwood Research, a nonprofit examining deceptive AI systems that could act against human interests.\n\u201cI\u2019m quite worried about the risks and think that the most important thing to work on is mitigating them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cSomewhat more selfishly, I just think it\u2019s really interesting. I work with the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met on super important problems.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not alone. His brother, roommate and girlfriend have also taken leave from Harvard for similar reasons. The three of them currently work for OpenAI.\nOther students are terrified of AGI, but less because it could destroy the human race and more because it could wreck their career before it\u2019s even begun. Half of 326 Harvard students surveyed by the school\u2019s undergraduate association and AI safety club were worried about AI\u2019s impact on their job prospects.\n\u201cIf your career is about to be automated by the end of the decade, then every year spent in college is one year subtracted from your short career,\u201d said Nikola Jurkovi\u0107, who graduated from Harvard this May and served as the AI safety group\u2019s AGI preparedness lead. \u201cI personally think AGI is maybe four years away and full automation of the economy is maybe five or six years away.\u201d\nAlready, some companies are hiring fewer interns and recent graduates because AI is capable of doing their tasks. Others are conducting mass layoffs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and cause unemployment to rise to 20% in the next few years.\nStudents are terrified that this shift will dramatically accelerate when true AGI arrives, though when that might happen is up for debate. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks AGI will be developed before 2029, while Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts that it\u2019ll come in the next five to 10 years. Jurkovi\u0107 believes it might arrive even sooner: He co-authored a timeline forecast for the AI Futures Project, which aligns with the prediction that most white-collar jobs could be automated by 2030.\nOthers disagree: \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that AGI will come in the next five years,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cIt\u2019s just marketing hype to pretend otherwise when so many core problems (like hallucinations and reasoning errors) remain unsolved.\u201d Marcus has noted that throwing more and more data and computing power at AI models has so far failed to produce models sophisticated enough to do many of the same kinds of tasks as humans.\nWhile questions remain about when AGI will occur and how valuable a college degree will be in a world upended by human-level artificial intelligence, students are itching to pursue their careers now, before, they worry, it\u2019s too late.\nThat\u2019s led many to drop out to start their own companies. Since 2023, students have been leaving college to chase the AI gold rush, drawn to the success stories of generations past like Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell, now 24, and Mercor CEO Brendan Foody, 22, dropped out of MIT and Georgetown University respectively to pursue their startups. Anysphere was last valued at $9.9 billion, while Mercor has raised over $100 million. With AGI threatening to completely replace human labor, some students see a ticking clock\u2014and a huge opportunity.\n\u201cI felt that there\u2019s a limited window to act in order to have a hand on the steering wheel,\u201d said Jared Mantell, who was studying economics and computer science at Washington University in St. Louis before dropping out to focus full-time on his startup dashCrystal, which aims to automate design of electronics. The company has raised over $800,000 so far at a valuation of around $20 million.\nDropping out means losing out on the benefits of a college degree. According to the Pew Research Center, younger adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree or more generally make at least $20,000 more than their peers without one. And in a world where entry-level jobs are being decimated by AI, lacking a degree could limit job prospects for young people even more.\nEven the cofounder of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator known for funding young founders who have dropped out, thinks students should stay in school. \u201cDon\u2019t drop out of college to start or work for a startup,\u201d Paul Graham posted on X in July. \u201cThere will be other (and probably better) startup opportunities, but you can\u2019t get your college years back.\u201d\nBlair doesn\u2019t think that dropping out of school is for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult and taxing to drop out of college early and get a job,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something that I would only recommend to extremely resilient individuals who felt they have been adequately prepared to get a job by college already.\u201d"

      "text": "For many businesses, Google used to be core to their strategy to get in front of potential customers. They'd use search engine optimization tactics to make sure they're one of the treasured few links that show up when you search for something.\nThose days are numbered, thanks to AI. Search traffic for businesses like travel site Kayak and edtech company Chegg is dropping, in part because 60% of searches on sites like Google aren't leading people to click any links, per one study \u2014 they just read the AI summary at the top. An executive at a cybersecurity company told Forbes search traffic to its website has gone down 10% this year. \u201cThe industry is really turned on its head because traditional ways of eventually SEO just don't work anymore,\u201d he said.\nNow, instead of ginning up content to rank higher in traditional search engines, businesses are increasingly trying to grok how their brands show up in answers generated by AI search engines like Google\u2019s AI Overviews, Perplexity and ChatGPT, and create new content designed to be picked up by bots \u2014 and a new crop of startups has sprung up to help them.\n\u201cThis is a true Game of Thrones power shift that is upon us here,\u201d said James Cadwallader, the cofounder and CEO of Profound, which helps more than 100 customers like U.S. Bank, Docusign and Indeed understand how their brands appear in AI responses. \u201cWe're entering this inflection point where humans no longer need to visit websites on the internet\u2026.These systems are hijacking that relationship with the end user entirely.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering this inflection point where humans no longer need to visit websites on the internet...These systems are hijacking that relationship with the end user entirely.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a \u201chair on fire\u201d problem for companies, said Kleiner Perkins partner Ilya Fushman who led a $20 million funding round into the startup, which is less than a year old. Nvidia and Khosla also participated in the round, which valued Profound at over $100 million.\nTo tackle it, Profound generates thousands of synthetic prompts like \u201ccheap football cleats\u201d or \u201cbest phone for a teenager\u201d and sends them to AI search engines to get an overall idea of which brands most frequently come up in different responses. The software is plugged into the brand\u2019s website to observe, in real time, which specific pages are being crawled the most.\nProfound then tracks \u201csentiment\u201d to gauge a brand\u2019s reputation within AI search by capturing phrases that could have negative connotations. Based on these metrics, it makes recommendations (as a traditional marketing agency would) like suggesting keywords, formatting style and layout and adding metadata to make pages easier to scrape by AI search engines. In some cases, it\u2019s also using AI models to generate content that\u2019s custom made to be crawled by AI search engines.\nIt\u2019s early days for this new burgeoning field, known as Generative Engine Optimization. For the cybersecurity company that\u2019s seen its search traffic dip by 10%, Profound is helping it track how competitors are performing in AI search results and produce new content to keep up with them. And an SEO specialist at a large job search company told Forbes he turned to Profound because the company had a \u201cblind spot\u201d in terms of how the business\u2019 content was being featured on AI search engines a few months ago. \u201cWe were completely in the dark,\u201d he said. With Profound, he\u2019s able to find popular prompts and learn how the company\u2019s blogs and data shows up in AI-generated answers. Even though traffic from tools like ChatGPT is less than 1% for the site, influencing how AI talks about the brand is where the market is headed, he said.\nBut influencing AI search engines\u2019 answers is no easy task. The models underlying them are constantly changing\u2014and along with them AI\u2019s responses. AI search engines answer the same question differently each time, depending on how and when they are prompted and who is writing the prompt. \u201cThat's why there's such value in being able to distill, disambiguate and communicate how things like ChatGPT are surfacing information to real people\u201d said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures who has backed Profound. \u201cIt's personally impossible to track on your own company's behalf.\u201d\nProfound isn\u2019t the only game in town. New York-based Bluefish AI, which has raised $5 million in seed funding from backers like Crane Ventures and Laconia, is helping companies in industries like travel, pharmaceutical and retail track how they appear on Gemini, Perplexity and ChatGPT. Big tech companies like Amazon, Meta and Microsoft are becoming AI companies, and as their tools attract hundreds of millions of users, it has been a \u201cwake up call\u201d for the marketing industry, CEO Alex Sherman said.\nWhile most websites are designed for human readers, they will have to be optimized to be crawled by large language models if businesses want to be featured in AI responses and reach customers directly. In March, OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy said on X that \u201c99.9% of attention is about to be LLM attention.\u201d\nWith a birds-eye view into AI responses, Bluefish is able to observe which sources of data are influencing brands\u2019 perception within AI responses. \u201cSome of the highest ranked third party sources that Bluefish sees across its customers are platforms like Reddit,\u201d he said.\nAnother player is Athena, cofounded by Andrew Yan, who formerly worked at Google Deepmind\u2019s generative media team, which uses its own AI search model that\u2019s trained on millions of prompts and data points to create a dashboard of different AI metrics like sources, mentions and referral rates. Yan said AI search has widened the scope for marketing as it draws from more sources than Google, where the top three linked websites are often the most viewed.\nProfound\u2019s Cadwallader is optimistic that AI search engines will create a new, and improved, way for people to discover new products and make informed purchasing decisions that are best catered to their preferences. As AI systems surf the internet on behalf of shoppers, scrape data from hundreds of websites and deliver AI-generated responses to them, businesses are realizing they need to command the attention of a new type of \u201cVIP customer\u201d\u2014 bots.\n\u201cEventually we believe in the zero click future where consumers will only interact with the answer engine and agents will be the primary visitor of websites and it'll be a good thing,\u201d he said."

Startups like Evertune and Profound are emerging to help companies navigate this shift by analyzing how brands are represented in AI outputs. Meanwhile, concerns about the impact of artificial general intelligence (AGI) are prompting students to drop out of prestigious universities to work on AI safety, fearing that AGI could threaten their future job prospects.",
