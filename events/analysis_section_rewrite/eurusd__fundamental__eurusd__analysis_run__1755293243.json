Keep the focus on Toyo Tires’ winter‑tire technology, clarify the role of walnut shells, and cite specific studies or industry sources that confirm their effectiveness. Add a brief comparison of studded vs. walnut‑shell‑enhanced tires, and tighten the language to maintain a neutral, informative tone. Ensure all claims are supported by reputable references and that the article’s structure follows a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.",
