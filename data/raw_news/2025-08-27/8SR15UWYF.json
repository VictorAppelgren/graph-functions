  "content": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported but later returned to the U.S., is gearing up for a new phase in his battle with the Trump administration, now staving off efforts to deport him to Uganda.\n\nAn evidentiary hearing is set to be scheduled in coming days, where U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis will weigh whether Abrego Garcia can be sent to the third country, where he has no known ties, despite raising fears of persecution and a willingness to be sent somewhere else.\n\nShe was wary Monday of the Trump administration\u2019s moves so far but said it\u2019s not too late for the government to \u201cright the ship.\u201d A Justice Department lawyer objected to her preliminary findings.\n\nHere are three key questions the hearing could answer.\n\u2022 Does Abrego Garcia have a right to choose where he\u2019s deported?\n\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers argue that the Trump administration cannot send him to Uganda because he has designated another country as the place he wishes to be sent: Costa Rica.\n\nIt became known last week that Costa Rica was on the table as a potential place to send Abrego Garcia, when his lawyers said he was presented with a deal to be removed there if he agreed to plead guilty and serve prison time in his human smuggling case first.\n\nA letter from the Costa Rican government, filed publicly in Abrego Garcia\u2019s criminal case, indicated that the country would accept him as a lawful immigrant and not send him back to El Salvador, his home country that he fled out of fear for his safety.\n\nWhen he declined to extend his stay in jail, opting to be released Friday, the government changed course and said it planned to send him to Uganda.\n\nBut on Saturday, Abrego Garcia signed a document designating Costa Rica as his preferred country of removal, sealed court filings obtained by The Hill sister network DC News Now show.\n\nFederal law dictates that noncitizens may \u201cdesignate one country to which the alien wants to be removed,\u201d at which point \u201cthe Attorney General shall remove the alien to the country the alien so designates.\u201d\n\nThere are four exceptions to that rule:\n\u2022 The designated country\u2019s government doesn\u2019t say whether it will accept the noncitizen, within 30 days of the attorney general\u2019s inquiry\n\u2022 The designated country declines to accept the noncitizen\n\u2022 The attorney general decides that removing the noncitizen to the country is \u201cprejudicial to the United States\u201d\n\nThe law lists off six other removal options before concluding with \u201cif impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible\u201d to remove the noncitizen to the countries described in the previous clauses, the government may select \u201canother country whose government will accept the alien into that country.\u201d\n\nXinis expressed an interest in exploring the law further, saying there \u201cmay be a violation.\u201d\n\u2022 What would happen to him in Uganda?\n\nIf sent to Uganda, Abrego Garcia says he has reason to fear his safety.\n\nOn Saturday, he signed a notice of fear of removal to Uganda, accounting concerns of persecution for his race, nationality and beliefs; \u201ctorture by or at the acquiescence\u201d of a public official there; and being sent back to his home country to face the same fate.\n\nSimon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers, told reporters Monday that his reasoning stems both from the \u201cgeneral situation\u201d in the country and the \u201clack of assurances\u201d that he could live there \u201cat liberty,\u201d without the risk of being quickly re-deported to El Salvador.\n\nXinis noted that it\u2019s unclear what, if anything, the government will say about the protections Uganda has offered Abrego Garcia through the United States.\n\n\u201cThe silence is taken certainly in contrast to what\u2019s been provided by the country of Costa Rica,\u201d Xinis said. \u201cThe contrast is significant.\u201d\n\nBy signing the notice, Abrego Garcia is entitled to a reasonable fear interview, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\n\n\u201cTo me, it seems very clear \u2014 crystal clear \u2014 that while we\u2019re waiting for that interview to be scheduled, while we\u2019re waiting for the results of that interview, they can\u2019t put him on a plane,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 What went down with the plea deal in his criminal case?\n\nXinis also raised the plea deal initially offered to Abrego Garcia in his criminal case as cause for concern.\n\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers said the offer came in Thursday night, on the eve of his release. It would be \u201coff the table forever\u201d by Monday, when he reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore, they said.\n\nThey\u2019ve framed the deal as an attempt to coerce Abrego Garcia into a guilty plea so he could be deported to his country of choice.\n\nThe Justice Department has not had a chance to respond in court filings in this case. But in the criminal case, it rejected the notion that the plea negotiations were anything nefarious.\n\nProsecutors said in court filings they had been engaged in plea negotiations since July, as is common in criminal cases. They called Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers\u2019 allegations \u201cmisleading\u201d and suggested it left the court with a \u201cmisimpression of the true facts.\u201d\n\nBut, at least until the hearing, Xinis said she had made up her mind on the matter.\n\nShe said Monday that, at least preliminarily, a showing has been made that the Justice Department conditioned Abrego Garcia\u2019s country of removal on whether he accepted the deal \u2013 and because he exercised his constitutional right to a trial, he\u2019d be sent to Uganda instead of Costa Rica.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t condition the relinquishing of a constitutional right in that regard,\u201d she said.\n\nWelcome to The Gavel, The Hill\u2019s weekly courts newsletter.

The Federal Reserve Act states that each member of its governing board will serve a 14-year term, unless sooner removed \u201cfor cause\u201d by the president.\n\nThe courts have never weighed the question because no president has ever attempted to remove a Fed governor. But they\u2019ll likely be asked to define it and determine whether Trump\u2019s allegations measure up.\n\nIn his letter to Cook declaring her removal, Trump pointed to a criminal referral from the Federal Housing Finance Agency that asserts she may have made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements. It echoes allegations against New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe referral alleges that, weeks apart, Cook wrote in mortgage documents for Michigan and Georgia properties that each was her \u201cprimary residence,\u201d a statement that can result in a lower rate. Trump called that \u201ccause\u201d for her removal.\n\n\u201cThe American people must be able to have full confidence in the honesty of members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIn light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.\u201d\n\nLowell, Cook\u2019s lawyer, is also representing James as the Trump administration investigates her personal real estate. He previously represented former President Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, against criminal gun and tax charges, and ex-Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) in his corruption case.\n\nOnce Cook\u2019s lawsuit is filed, the likely first step is to seek an injunction barring Trump\u2019s order from taking effect, allowing her to continue in her role.\n\nIf it eventually reaches the Supreme Court, it\u2019s not clear how the legal challenge will be met.\n\nThe justices have increasingly signaled interest in gutting precedent that has kept certain federal agency leaders from facing presidential firings at-will for nearly a century, but earlier this year, they also warned that the Fed could be an exception.\n\nIn a May emergency ruling that greenlit Trump\u2019s terminations of Democratic appointees at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), they said, in short, the Fed is different.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\u201d the court stressed.\n\nBut that \u201cposes a puzzle,\u201d the court\u2019s liberal justices, wrote in dissent.\n\n\u201cFor the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said.\n\nAlina Habba has for years been one of President Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders in and outside the courtroom.\n\nNow, he\u2019s sharpening his claws for the fight to keep her installed as New Jersey\u2019s top federal prosecutor.\n\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department on Monday said it will appeal a judge\u2019s ruling barring Habba from overseeing federal cases in the role, while the president himself said he was eying legal action against a longstanding Senate practice that has stopped controversial nominees from maintaining their positions.\n\nTrump was forced to withdraw Habba\u2019s nomination for U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey after the clock ran out on her interim term and federal judges declined to keep her in the position, instead tapping her deputy for the role, who was then swiftly fired by Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nSince then, Habba has served as acting U.S. attorney. But a judge last week ruled that she has done so unlawfully since July 24, after the Trump administration used a \u201cnovel series of legal and personnel moves\u201d to keep her in the role.\n\nThe question of her legitimacy has caused chaos in New Jersey\u2019s courts already. In a court filing Tuesday, the Justice Department said that at least 12 federal judges in New Jersey had adjourned matters, from trials to guilty plea hearings and sentencings, while waiting for answers \u2014 even before the judge had ruled.\n\nThe administration\u2019s decision to appeal signals the president is digging his heels in on behalf of one of his most loyal nominees.\n\nHe\u2019s already fighting her rejection through the judiciary. But on Monday, he signaled an interest in taking the fight to Congress, too.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be hearing about the blue slipping,\u201d Trump said during a winding press event, announcing he planned to file a lawsuit against the practice that lets home-state senators veto nominees to district courts and U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices.\n\nBoth of New Jersey\u2019s Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed Habba\u2019s nomination as the state\u2019s top federal prosecutor. Several of his most loyal nominees have also failed to gain enough support in the upper chamber to assume the posts to which they were nominated permanently.\n\nTrump said the \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d makes it impossible to push through his nominees.\n\n\u201cBecause if you have \u2014 you don\u2019t need two senators, you just need one Democrat senator with a Republican,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that might also make it difficult to mount a successful legal challenge.\n\n\u201cThe idea of filing a lawsuit challenging the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s blue-slip practice is loony,\u201d Ed Whelan, a conservative legal commentator, wrote on X.\n\nThe practice is not codified in law nor written into the Senate\u2019s official rules; it\u2019s merely tradition. A judge might not take it seriously as a legal claim, so much as a political dispute between two coequal branches of government.\n\nIn fact, a federal judge on Tuesday threw out the Trump administration\u2019s lawsuit against all 15 federal district judges in Maryland on similar grounds.\n\nThough the administration\u2019s complaints about the court\u2019s challenged standing order were \u201cfair enough,\u201d U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen said suing the entire bench wasn\u2019t the right way to go about seeking reprieve.\n\n\u201cIf these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 Abrego Garcia battle resumes: Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported but later returned to the U.S., filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport him again \u2014 this time to Uganda, a country to which he has no known ties. He was detained Monday morning after being freed from custody in a criminal case filed against him in federal court in Tennessee on Friday.\n\u2022 FBI raid Bolton: Federal agents searched the Washington-area home and office of Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton on Friday morning, an effort related to classified documents.\n\u2022 DEI dollars drained: The Supreme Court said the Trump administration can cancel hundreds of millions of dollars in National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants linked to diversity initiatives in a 5-4 ruling Thursday.\n\u2022 Trump fraud appeal: A New York appeals court threw out the roughly $500 million civil fraud penalty against Trump and his business empire on Thursday but left the case intact.\n\u2022 0-3 on Epstein: A federal judge on Wednesday rejected the Trump administration\u2019s bid to unseal grand jury materials used to charge disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein with sex trafficking, the third judge to rule against the administration in its efforts to unseal the typically secret documents.\n\u2022 New job, who dis: Law firm Foley Hoag announced that Hampton Dellinger, the former U.S. Special Counsel who challenged his firing by Trump, has joined its ranks as a partner in its Washington, D.C. office. Former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who served in the role under President Biden, is also rejoining the law firm Cooley to lead its Supreme Court and appellate practice group in D.C.\n\u2022 In the hot seat: A judge ordered Kari Lake, a Trump ally and senior advisor at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, to sit for a deposition in a last-ditch bid to stave off a contempt trial over her refusal to provide information about efforts to dismantle the agency.\n\u2022 Menendez brothers won\u2019t go free: A California board denied parole to Lyle and Eric Menendez. It\u2019s the closest the brothers have come to being released in decades, since their life sentences were reduced in May for their convictions in the 1989 murder of their parents.\n\u2022 Update from a different Menendez: The wife of ex-Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Nadine Menendez, asked a judge to sentence her to a year and one day in prison for her role in the bribery scheme that also sent her husband and two New Jersey businessmen to prison. She points to a \u201clifetime of trauma,\u201d from her childhood in warworn Lebanon to her current cancer.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching for now:\n\u2022 Xinis, the judge overseeing Abrego Garcia\u2019s new lawsuit, is set to hold a scheduling conference where she will likely pick a date to hold an evidentiary hearing.\n\u2022 Louisiana\u2019s brief in a redistricting dispute regarding the creation of a second majority-Black congressional district is due to be filed at the Supreme Court, after the justices sought supplemental briefing despite hearing oral arguments in March.

Trade deals get help but not some conservative causes\nSome law firms that reached pro bono deals with President Donald Trump appear reluctant to take on some conservative causes, and in some instances, they are taking cases adverse to the administration, according to news reports.\nNearly five months after BigLaw firms began reaching the pro bono deals, \u201cthere\u2019s little outward sign that the agreements have impacted their business operations,\u201d Bloomberg Law reports.\nThe deals required nine firms to provide $940 million collectively in pro bono help toward causes supported by Trump to avoid punitive executive orders. Much of what is known about the deals \u201cis essentially written on the back of a digital napkin, contributing to the uneven delivery,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reports.\nBloomberg Law reports that at least some of the deals weren\u2019t signed. They don\u2019t impose deadlines and don\u2019t include an enforcement mechanism.\nBoth articles noted that four other firms have so far successfully challenged punitive executive orders. The rulings \u201clikely tamped down any sense of urgency\u201d by the dealing firms, Bloomberg Law says.\nThe Wall Street Journal says these potential avenues for pro bono mostly didn\u2019t materialize:\n\u2022 Legal help for police officers accused of misconduct. BigLaw firms haven\u2019t volunteered, according to Devin Barrington-Ward, a spokesman for the National Police Accountability Project.\n\u2022 Help for conservative causes as requested by the Oversight Project, a conservative watchdog group formerly affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Most firms didn\u2019t respond when contacted, said the group\u2019s president, Mike Howell.\n\u2022 Pro bono assistance for the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office in New York City, as suggested by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft global litigation co-chair Nick Gravante. The firm did not contact the office, according to a district attorney spokesperson.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce is receiving assistance, however, according to a spokesperson. The department is working with \u201csome of America\u2019s top law firms and legal minds to cement the truly historic trade deals that President Trump negotiated for the American people,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nOne firm reportedly working on trade deals is Kirkland & Ellis, according to the articles and a report in the New York Times.\nBloomberg Law reports that some of the nine firms \u201chave continued to take the kinds of cases that appear to have made them targets in the first place.\u201d\nOne example cited by Bloomberg Law is Milbank partners\u2019 involvement in litigation challenging Trump\u2019s tariffs and defending two New Jersey cities in Trump administration challenges to their immigration policies. Another example is a lawsuit filed by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison against the Proud Boys, a right-wing group, and its leader alleging infringement of trademarks awarded to a church vandalized by Proud Boys members.\nBut leaders for public-interest nonprofits who spoke with the Wall Street Journal said some BigLaw firms are ignoring their phone calls, even when the firms provided pro bono assistance in the past.\nHat tip to How Appealing, which provided the link to the Wall Street Journal article.\nWrite a letter to the editor, share a story tip or update, or report an error."

      "text": "Washington, DC \u2013 August 25, 2025 \u2013 Today, Cooley announced that Elizabeth Prelogar has rejoined the firm as a partner in its global litigation department. Prelogar was the 48th Solicitor General of the United States and will lead Cooley\u2019s Supreme Court and appellate practice group from Washington, DC.\n\u201cElizabeth is one of the most respected lawyers and oral advocates in the country,\u201d said Cooley partner and CEO Rachel Proffitt. \u201cHer experience advising the federal government on the most significant legal issues of our time and defending the interests of the United States before the US Supreme Court will be invaluable for our many innovative and disruptive clients. We are thrilled to welcome her home.\u201d\nIn her role as Solicitor General, Prelogar oversaw all of the US government\u2019s litigation in the Supreme Court, where she personally argued dozens of cases, managed the Department of Justice\u2019s appellate strategy in courts throughout the nation and served as a principal legal advisor to the executive branch.\n\u201cIn addition to being one of the best lawyers of her generation, Elizabeth is a great person and reflects all the values we seek in our partnership \u2013 hardworking, decent and committed to succeeding together,\u201d said Ian Shapiro, Cooley partner and chair of the firm\u2019s global litigation department. \u201cWhen Elizabeth first joined us in January 2020, she embraced our ambition to be one of the country\u2019s elite litigation practices. Her return establishes Cooley\u2019s Supreme Court and appellate group as one of the industry\u2019s premier practices.\u201d\nBefore Prelogar\u2019s service as Solicitor General from 2021 to 2025, she was a partner at Cooley from 2020 to 2021 and an Assistant to the Solicitor General from 2014 to 2019. Earlier in her career, Prelogar clerked for Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as well as for Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.\n\u201cCooley\u2019s platform was exactly what I was looking for in my return to private practice: a firm with brilliant and creative lawyers, innovative clients, a reputation as a litigation powerhouse, a strong culture, and a steadfast commitment to clients and the rule of law,\u201d said Prelogar. \u201cI am proud to rejoin a team that lives those values and excited to build a standout Supreme Court and appellate practice that will help clients navigate their most complex and high-stakes legal issues.\u201d\nDuring Prelogar\u2019s service as Solicitor General, Cooley\u2019s Supreme Court and appellate practice was led by Kathleen Hartnett and Adam Gershenson, who will continue to collaborate with Prelogar and the rest of the appellate team. The practice also recently welcomed several next-generation appellate advocates, including Ephraim McDowell and Ray Tolentino. McDowell was a former Assistant to the Solicitor General under Prelogar and served as Deputy Associate Counsel in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. Tolentino was a Special Assistant to the President and Associate White House Counsel to the President, as well as Special Counsel to the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary. McDowell and Tolentino clerked for Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, respectively.\nCooley\u2019s litigation department includes 460 lawyers in the US and Europe and is the top litigation department for the representation of tech, life sciences and other innovative companies.\nThis content is provided for general informational purposes only, and your access or use of the content does not create an attorney-client relationship between you or your organization and Cooley LLP, Cooley (UK) LLP, or any other affiliated practice or entity (collectively referred to as \"Cooley\").

The court shall advance on the docket and expedite the disposition of a civil action filed under this subparagraph to the greatest extent practicable. For purposes of this subparagraph, a State or its residents shall be considered to have been harmed if the State or its residents experience harm, including financial harm in excess of $100.\nExcept as provided in section 259(a) [1] of title 42 and paragraph (2),[2] the Attorney General may not remove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from imprisonment.

      "text": "Section 10. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n1. Appointment and qualification of members\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (hereinafter referred to as the \"Board\") shall be composed of seven members, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, after the date of enactment of the Banking Act of 1935, for terms of fourteen years except as hereinafter provided, but each appointive member of the Federal Reserve Board in office on such date shall continue to serve as a member of the Board until February 1, 1936, and the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency shall continue to serve as members of the Board until February 1, 1936. In selecting the members of the Board, not more than one of whom shall be selected from any one Federal Reserve district, the President shall have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and geographical divisions of the country. In selecting members of the Board, the President shall appoint at least 1 member with demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks having less than $10,000,000,000 in total assets. The members of the Board shall devote their entire time to the business of the Board and shall each receive an annual salary of $15,000, payable monthly, together with actual necessary traveling expenses.\n[12 USC 241. As amended by acts of June 3, 1922 (42 Stat. 620); Aug. 23, 1935 (49 Stat. 704); and Jan. 12, 2015 (129 Stat. 9). Prior to the enactment of the Banking Act of 1935, approved Aug. 23, 1935, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was known as the Federal Reserve Board. See note to the third paragraph of section 1. The portion of this paragraph dealing with salaries of Board members has in effect been amended numerous times, most recently by Executive Order. Prior to the act of December 27, 2000, section 1002 of which revised the executive schedule, the salary of the chairman of the Board was set at executive schedule level 2 and the salary of other members at level 3. The salary of the chairman of the Board is now set at executive schedule level I, and the salary of other members at level II (see 2 USC 358 and 5 USC 5313 and 5314).]\n2. Members ineligible to serve member banks; term of office; chairman and vice chairman\nThe members of the Board shall be ineligible during the time they are in office and for two years thereafter to hold any office, position, or employment in any member bank, except that this restriction shall not apply to a member who has served the full term for which he was appointed. Upon the expiration of the term of any appointive member of the Federal Reserve Board in office on the date of enactment of the Banking Act of 1935, the President shall fix the term of the successor to such member at not to exceed fourteen years, as designated by the President at the time of nomination, but in such manner as to provide for the expiration of the term of not more than one member in any two-year period, and thereafter each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed for cause by the President. Of the persons thus appointed, 1 shall be designated by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve as Chairman of the Board for a term of 4 years, and 2 shall be designated by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve as Vice Chairmen of the Board, each for a term of 4 years, 1 of whom shall serve in the absence of the Chairman, as provided in the fourth undesignated paragraph of this section, and 1 of whom shall be designated Vice Chairman for Supervision. The Vice Chairman for Supervision shall develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution holding companies and other financial firms supervised by the Board, and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms. The chairman of the Board, subject to its supervision, shall be its active executive officer. Each member of the Board shall within fifteen days after notice of appointment make and subscribe to the oath of office. Upon the expiration of their terms of office, members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified. Any person appointed as a member of the Board after the date of enactment of the Banking Act of 1935 shall not be eligible for reappointment as such member after he shall have served a full term of fourteen years.\n[12 USC 242. As amended by acts of March 3, 1919 (40 Stat. 1315); June 3, 1922 (42 Stat. 620); June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 166); Aug. 23, 1935 (49 Stat. 704); November 16, 1977 (91 Stat. 1388); and act of July 21, 2010 (124 Stat. 2126). The Banking Act of 1935, referred to in this paragraph, became effective Aug. 23, 1935. Prior to the enactment of that act, the chairman and vice chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System were known as the governor and vice governor of the Federal Reserve Board, respectively. See note to the third paragraph of section 1. The act of November 16, 1977, amended the second sentence of this paragraph. The amendment takes effect on Jan. 1, 1979, and applies to individuals who are designated by the President on or after such date to serve as chairman or vice chairman. The act of July 21, 2010, designated a new Vice Chairman for Supervision.]\n3. Assessments on Federal reserve banks\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall have power to levy semiannually upon the Federal reserve banks, in proportion to their capital stock and surplus, an assessment sufficient to pay its estimated expenses and the salaries of its members and employees for the half year succeeding the levying of such assessments, together with any deficit carried forward from the preceding half year, and such assessments may include amounts sufficient to provide for the acquisition by the Board in its own name of such site or building in the District of Columbia as in its judgment alone shall be necessary for the purpose of providing suitable and adequate quarters for the performance of its functions. After September 1, 2000, the Board may also use such assessments to acquire, in its own name, a site or building (in addition to the facilities existing on such date) to provide for the performance of the functions of the Board. After approving such plans, estimates, and specifications as it shall have caused to be prepared, the Board may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, cause to be constructed on any site so acquired by it a building or buildings suitable and adequate in its judgment for its purposes and proceed to take all such steps as it may deem necessary or appropriate in connection with the construction, equipment, and furnishing of such building or buildings. The Board may maintain, enlarge, or remodel any building or buildings so acquired or constructed and shall have sole control of such building or buildings and space therein.\n[12 USC 243. As reenacted without change by act of June 3, 1922 (42 Stat. 621); and amended by acts of June 19, 1934 (48 Stat. 1108) and Dec. 27, 2000 (114 Stat. 3027). By act approved June 27, 1935 (49 Stat. 425), provision was made for the furnishing of steam from the central heating plant to the Federal Reserve Board, now the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.]\n4. Principal offices; expenses; deposit of funds; members not to be officers or stockholders of banks\nThe principal offices of the Board shall be in the District of Columbia. At meetings of the Board the chairman shall preside, and, in his absence, the vice chairman shall preside. In the absence of the chairman and the vice chairman, the board shall elect a member to act as chairman pro tempore. The Board shall determine and prescribe the manner in which its obligations shall be incurred and its disbursements and expenses allowed and paid, and may leave on deposit in the Federal Reserve banks the proceeds of assessments levied upon them to defray its estimated expenses and the salaries of its members and employees, whose employment, compensation, leave, and expenses shall be governed solely by the provisions of this Act, specific amendments thereof, and rules and regulations of the Board not inconsistent therewith; and funds derived from such assessments shall not be construed to be Government funds or appropriated moneys. No member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall be an officer or director of any bank, banking institution, trust company, or Federal Reserve bank or hold stock in any bank, banking institution, or trust company; and before entering upon his duties as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System he shall certify under oath that he has complied with this requirement, and such certification shall be filed with the secretary of the Board. Whenever a vacancy shall occur, other than by expiration of term, among the six members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System appointed by the President as above provided, a successor shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to fill such vacancy, and when appointed he shall hold office for the unexpired term of his predecessor.\n[12 USC 244. As amended by acts of June 3, 1922 (42 Stat. 621); June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 167); Aug. 23, 1935 (49 Stat. 705). The reference to \"the six members\" of the Board of Governors is an apparent error in the law and should read \"the seven members.\" See section 10, first paragraph, this act.]\n5. Vacancies during recess of Senate\nThe President shall have power to fill all vacancies that may happen on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System during the recess of the Senate by granting commissions which shall expire with the next session of the Senate.\n[12 USC 245. As amended by act of June 3, 1922 (42 Stat. 621).]\n6. Reservation of powers of Secretary of Treasury\nNothing in this Act contained shall be construed as taking away any powers heretofore vested by law in the Secretary of the Treasury which relate to the supervision, management, and control of the Treasury Department and bureaus under such department, and wherever any power vested by this Act in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal reserve agent appears to conflict with the powers of the Secretary of the Treasury, such powers shall be exercised subject to the supervision and control of the Secretary.\n[12 USC 246. As reenacted without change by act of June 3, 1922 (42 Stat. 621).]\n7. Annual report\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall annually make a full report of its operations to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who shall cause the same to be printed for the information of the Congress.

As reenacted without change by act of June 3, 1922 (42 Stat. 621) and amended by acts of June 3, 1922, and Dec. 27, 2000 (114 Stat. 3030).]\n8. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nSection three hundred and twenty-four of the Revised Statutes of the United States shall be amended so as to read as follows:\n(a) Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Established. There is established in the Department of the Treasury a bureau to be known as the \"Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\" which is charged with assuring the safety and soundness of, and compliance with laws and regulations, fair access to financial services, and fair treatment of customers by, the institutions and other persons subject to its jurisdiction.\n(b) Comptroller Of The Currency.\n- In General.

      "text": "The Supreme Court is historically unpopular right now. Or is it?\nIs the Supreme Court\u2019s approval rating at a five-year high or record low? It depends on which survey you\u2019re reading.\nIn just the past two months, at least seven national polls on the court\u2019s work have been fielded and released, leading to a confusing \u2013 and at times contradictory \u2013 mix of headlines about how the public views the justices.\nThe surveys reported not just different approval ratings, but different trend lines. Gallup found that Americans\u2019 views of the Supreme Court are historically low, while a Fox News Poll showed that the court\u2019s approval rating is higher today than it\u2019s been since 2020.\nThe different results stemmed from a variety of factors, including differences in question wording and sample size. And when they reported on trends, survey firms were drawing on their own past findings, not other recent polls.\nFor those reasons and others, each of the seven surveys told a unique story about Americans\u2019 views on the Supreme Court. But a few themes emerge if you read them all in a row. Here are four key takeaways from the seven surveys.\n1. The Supreme Court\u2019s approval rating is under 50%.\nSix of the seven polls included a traditional approval rating question in which respondents were asked if they approve or disapprove of the justices\u2019 job performance. (The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was the exception.) And although the resulting approval rating varied from survey to survey, none of the six polls showed majority support for the Supreme Court:\nIn fact, in four of the six surveys, including the Gallup poll that, earlier this month, inspired multiple news articles about support for the court reaching a record low, the court\u2019s approval rating was at least 10 percentage points below 50%, falling between 35% and 40%.\nThe gap between those four polls and the two that reported a slightly higher approval rating \u2013 the Marquette Law School Poll (49%) and the Fox News Poll (47%) \u2013 likely stemmed from differences in the question wording and response options.\nWhile five of the six surveys, including Marquette\u2019s, asked respondents to assess how the Supreme Court \u201cis handling its job,\u201d the Fox News Poll asked respondents how they feel about \u201cthe job the Supreme Court of the United States is doing.\u201d Even a slight difference in question wording can lead to a different pattern in responses, according to Pew Research Center, which explains why survey firms typically build trend lines with responses over time to the exact same question, rather than responses to similar questions.\nWhat made the Marquette Law School Poll unique is that participants had only two response options: \u201capprove\u201d or \u201cdisapprove.\u201d The other polls included the option to express uncertainty or no opinion.\nThe Gallup and Fox News Poll survey reports were the only two to include a trend line showing how the court\u2019s approval rating has changed over the past two decades. Both organizations say it hasn\u2019t been above 50% since the summer of 2020, but they disagree on what direction it\u2019s currently moving, with Fox News showing the court\u2019s approval rating increasing and Gallup showing it decreasing.\nThat said, the Supreme Court still has a higher approval rating than Congress, according to the two polls that asked about Congress\u2019 performance: the surveys from The Economist/YouGov (18%) and Gallup (26%). The four polls that asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s job performance \u2013 Quinnipiac (40%), Fox News (46%), Gallup (37%), and The Economist/YouGov (42%) \u2013 found that his approval rating is about the same as the Supreme Court\u2019s.\n2. There is a partisan gap in Supreme Court approval.\nAll six of the polls that produced an overall approval rating also shared how responses from Republicans and Democrats differed. Republicans expressed far higher levels of support for the justices\u2019 job performance in each poll, with the average partisan gap across the six polls being a massive 60.5 percentage points.\nRepublicans were also more positive than Democrats about the Supreme Court in the seventh poll, from AP-NORC. It found that 31% of Republicans have \u201ca great deal\u201d of confidence in the people running the Supreme Court, compared to just 5% of Democrats.\nSimilarly large partisan gaps were present in the responses to a variety of other questions included in the surveys. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say the court has about the right amount of power (67% vs. 38%), that it\u2019s mainly motivated by the law rather than politics (54% vs. 9%), and that it\u2019s generally \u201cabout right\u201d in its decisions (56% vs. 17%).\nThese results match historical trends in the sense that Republicans are typically happier with the Supreme Court than Democrats when there\u2019s a Republican in the White House, according to Gallup. What\u2019s unique about this political moment is that Republican support for the court was already higher than Democratic support during the second half of the Biden administration; the court\u2019s approval rating from Republicans surged after its June 2022 decision overruling Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to an abortion.\n3. The Dobbs decision still looms large in Supreme Court polling.\nGallup reported that the June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization pushed court-related polarization to a new level. Five of the six largest partisan gaps in Supreme Court approval identified by Gallup over the past 25 years came in surveys fielded after the Dobbs decision was handed down. (The exception was a 58-percentage point gap measured in July 2015 after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. In that case, Democrats showed more support than Republicans.)\nGallup wasn\u2019t the only survey firm or news site to mention the abortion ruling when reporting on new polling data. The Associated Press similarly noted that the \u201cpartisan divide has been persistent and stark\u201d since Dobbs was decided.\nThat said, the court\u2019s overall approval rating was already falling before June 2022, when the partisan gap notably expanded. Gallup\u2019s trend line shows that the court\u2019s approval rating dropped from 53% to 49% from August 2020 to July 2021, and Fox News\u2019 chart shows a similar shift from July 2020 to June 2022. The downward trend over this period was driven by drops in support from both Republicans and Democrats, according to Gallup\u2019s historical data. While Republican support for the court has surged since then, the approval rating from Democrats has made a similar move in the opposite direction, which is keeping the court\u2019s overall approval rating below 50%.\nPossible explanations for the approval rating drop from mid-2020 to mid-2022 include the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to several controversial decisions on vaccine mandates and church closures, and high-profile rulings on transgender workers, the Affordable Care Act, and faith-based adoption agencies (the first two rulings angered many Republicans, while the third angered many Democrats.) The Advisory Opinions podcast recently pointed to Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation in October 2020 as a possible source of the recent approval rating drop, noting that many people were frustrated that the Senate acted on her nomination so close to a presidential election after refusing to confirm Merrick Garland four years earlier.\n4. Men are more likely to approve of the Supreme Court than women.\nIn addition to identifying a partisan gap in views on the Supreme Court, several of the polls identified a gender gap. The four survey reports that broke down approval ratings by gender found at least a five-percentage point gap between the ratings from men and women, with men having a higher approval rating of the court. The average gender gap across the four polls was 11.5 percentage points.\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll identified a similar gender gap in responses to its question about what motivates the Supreme Court. Seventy percent of women said it\u2019s mainly motivated by politics, rather than the law, compared to 56% of men.\nThe Dobbs ruling may have caused or widened the gender gap, although that theory is not addressed in this summer\u2019s survey reports. Previous research has shown that men were more supportive of the Dobbs ruling than women and that the gender gap in views on abortion has reached historic highs since the abortion decision was released.\nSince a draft of the majority opinion leaked in May 2022, the share of women who identify as \u201cpro-choice\u201d or consider abortion to be \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d has held steady, while the share of men who claim the label or hold that view has decreased, according to Gallup. And Pew found in July 2022 that 47% of women \u201cstrongly\u201d disapproved of the Dobbs decision, compared to 37% of men.\nConclusion\nAlthough the seven recent polls offered seven different takes on the Supreme Court\u2019s popularity, it\u2019s fair to conclude that fewer than half of Americans approve of the justices\u2019 job performance and that Republicans (as well as men) hold much more positive feelings about the court than Democrats (and women).\nIt\u2019s less clear what role the court\u2019s 2022 abortion ruling played in these partisan and gender gaps, or where the court\u2019s approval rating will go from here. Finding answers will require fielding even more surveys.\nPosted in Uncategorized\nCases: Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization"

KARI LAKE, et al., Defendants. PATSY WIDAKUSWARA, et al., Plaintiffs, v. KARI LAKE, et al., Defendants. On April 22, 2025, the Court entered preliminary injunctions in the above-captioned cases, Part III of which enjoined the defendants to \u201crestore VOA programming such that VOA fulfills its statutory mandate that VOA \u2018serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.\u2019\u201d See Preliminary Injunction Order, No. 25-cv-1015-RCL, ECF No. 98. That order remains in effect as of this date. Since the plaintiffs first raised serious questions about the defendants\u2019 compliance with the preliminary injunction, the Court has afforded the defendants multiple opportunities to explain how it is doing so. Most recently, on July 30, 2025, the Court entered an Order to Show Cause, the operative language of which is reproduced below, directing the defendants to provide the following information: ORDER Case No. 1:25-cv-887-RCL Case No. 1:25-cv-1015-RCL Case 1:25-cv-00887-RCL Document 72 Filed 08/25/25 Page 2 of 3 1.

How the defendants have restored VOA programming such that VOA is producing and broadcasting news consistent with the International Broadcasting Act, in each relevant medium (radio, television, and online content), and for each language in which VOA is operating; b. How the defendants\u2019 actions are consistent with VOA\u2019s congressional appropriations; c. Whether the defendants have notified Congress of their significant reduction in broadcast hours, as required by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024; 2. Identify the precise number of USAGM employees who have been recalled from administrative leave, and explain whether they are actively working on VOA programming, and what work product they have produced; and identify the precise number of USAGM employees that remain on administrative leave. 3. Produce all documents reflecting the defendants\u2019 plan to restore VOA programming to fulfill its statutory mandate. 4. Produce all documents reflecting the defendants\u2019 plans for further termination of USAGM staff, including but not limited to any Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans (\u201cARRPs\u201d), RIF notices to be provided to Agency employees or the unions representing them, lists of positions to be covered by any future RIFs, and any other relevant documents or information the defendants have drafted or compiled on these subjects to date. 5.

The Court has carefully studied the defendants\u2019 responses thereto and, for the reasons raised at the August 25, 2025 hearing, finds that the defendants\u2019 response fails to provide the information ordered in the Court\u2019s Order to Show Cause\u2014let alone explain how they are in compliance with the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction, even on their preferred interpretation of VOA\u2019s statutory mandate.

      "text": "Confusion, explosive anger and waiting: NPR spent a day in New York immigration court\nConfusion, explosive anger and waiting: NPR spent a day in New York immigration court\nThe halls of the immigration courts in lower Manhattan are quiet on a recent August day \u2014 except for the sounds of five men wearing masks and sunglasses, looking at their phones and talking among themselves. They are immigration and federal law enforcement officers, continuing the show of force that has thrown immigration courts into chaos.\nEight months ago, the courts were a little-known part of the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), where judges oversee the cases of individuals living in the country illegally. This summer, however, the halls of 26 Federal Plaza and 290 Broadway in lower Manhattan, along with dozens of other courts nationwide, became the epicenters of the Trump administration's efforts to increase the rate of immigration arrests.\n\"There weren't any ICE agents in the very beginning, and in the past six months it's increasing,\" said John Sarabella, a volunteer with the New Sanctuary Coalition, an immigrant rights group that advocates against deportations. \"And their strategies and their tactics have become more and more aggressive and assertive.\"\nSarabella, who says he visits the courts in Manhattan once a week, now witnesses arrests every time. He is one of the many who oppose the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies. Various groups protest outside the buildings, clergy members escort immigrants to hearings, and there are occasional arrests or clashes between law enforcement and elected officials.\nLast week, New York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, filed a brief in court calling for an end to courthouse arrests by federal agencies.\n\"This campaign has taken a heavy toll on our residents,\" the filing stated, adding that the strategy deters people from attending their mandatory hearings and weakens trust in law enforcement.\nThe presence of federal agents conducting immigration enforcement has thrown the established hierarchy within these hallways into mayhem.\n\"We've seen an institution die in real time,\" said Benjamin Remy, a senior staff attorney with the New York Legal Assistance Group, which provides legal services to immigrants navigating the court system. \"To see this institution that we've been arguing cases in, that we've been representing people in for years and years, essentially just be eviscerated by the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and in a matter of months \u2014 has been absolutely surreal.\"\nRemy, like other legal advocates, spends his days in the halls of the immigration courts, speaking with immigrants as they are apprehended by officers in the courtroom doorways \u2014 even when a judge grants them additional time or a new hearing date. He said these arrests highlight broader issues of due process.\n\"This nexus that we're seeing, even just here in New York City, in the immigration courts, just really raises all these fundamental questions for us as to democracy and what country we want to live in,\" Remy said. \"It's also important to realize that this isn't solely an immigration issue. This is a fundamental due process, constitutional issue.\"\nCourthouses in Manhattan are under increased scrutiny\nA week before NPR's visit to both federal buildings, 26 Federal Plaza had been cleared out after immigration officials found an unknown white powder in an envelope.\nVarious advocacy organizations regularly demonstrate against arrests.\nThe atmosphere inside the buildings offers contrasting experiences. Some visitors come through security joyfully, combing their hair as they prepare to finally be sworn in as U.S. citizens. Others nervously clutch their binders and plastic accordion folders filled with personal documentation, diplomas and the paperwork they hope will allow them to remain.\nThe churn is quick. In one courtroom at 26 Federal Plaza, an immigration judge ticks through more than two dozen cases. He calls each person up by name, many virtually, and announces for each that removal proceedings have begun for them to leave the U.S.\nHe asks the migrants' lawyers if their clients admit to the charges brought by the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 that the clients entered or are in the country illegally. The answer: yes. The judge asks the DHS lawyers to designate a country of removal: China, Guyana, Colombia, India.\nFinally, the judge sets a date for an individual hearing \u2014 a chance to pursue asylum, cancellation of removal or other forms of relief. The dates? All in 2029.\nThat year has become routine in courts across the country as immigration judges juggle a 3.7 million-case backlog. Remy, the lawyer at NYLAG, said over the past few weeks, fewer people have shown up for their hearings, risking final removal orders.\n\"People are being put into an absolutely impossible situation,\" he said. \"They're being forced to gamble their own liberty versus potentially continuing with their case, continuing with their claim.\"\nConflicting protocol from competing agencies\nCourt security is buckling underneath the pressure of conflicting protocol instructions.\nAs a result, NPR journalists were sometimes granted access to the public areas as long as they avoided recording \u2014 a directive consistent with longstanding EOIR policy. At other times, sometimes in the same building, they were allowed to record in some hallways, barred from other hallways, and denied entry to spaces designated for the public.\nParagon Systems employees, whose company holds the security contract under the Federal Protective Service, a DHS agency, acknowledged to NPR that its directives kept changing.\nIn one courtroom on the 20th floor of 290 Broadway, a judge began to run through a few hours of migrants' first court appearances. A young girl appeared via video conference, representing herself. Her case was transferred to a juvenile docket. She will have to reappear.\nFour men sat on the wooden benches, waiting to have their cases heard.\nSuddenly, federal agents told NPR journalists \u2014 the only members of the press in the public hearing \u2014 to leave the room. Half a dozen agents, including officers with vests that read \"ICE,\" and a security official with Paragon, told reporters they weren't allowed in the room.\nThe court clerk stepped into the doorway of the open courtroom due to the commotion \u2014 while officers asked NPR repeatedly to step out. Minutes later the court clerk reemerged, and allowed NPR to reenter the courtroom, though federal agents lingered by the door. Officers could be heard asking photographers why some reporters were allowed in, and those with cameras were not.\nThe judge whispered to the clerk, who left and returned with what appeared to be an additional court official who walked across the courtroom and closed the door, leaving the officers out of sight.\nA man from the Dominican Republic told the judge in the room that he had little reason to stay. He opted to voluntarily depart. He left, and was followed by federal officials down the hall and out of sight.\nIncreased pressure, changing rules\nThe next day, tensions escalated.\nBack on the 20th floor, dozens of immigrants, court observers, federal agents and journalists lingered in the waiting room and halls.\nPeople nervously tapped their feet. Girls in dresses were laughing among themselves as they sat next to a plainclothed, unmasked law enforcement officer.\nA small group of federal law enforcement agents, wearing vests that read \"police\" and \"federal police,\" sat in the corner of the waiting room, mostly out of sight and occasionally pulling black-colored face covers up and down. Another, wearing a mask, paced the halls.\nAs NPR and a court observer \u2014 an immigrant advocate \u2014 entered the hall, federal enforcement brushed past. A federal supervisor, who was unmasked and had been sitting in the waiting area earlier, yelled at NPR: \"stop f****** following me! Why are you f****** following me?\" before turning and yelling the same thing to the court observer.\n\"It's not f****** about you!\" she retorted.\nAs they turned the corner, more shouting could be heard.\n\"Don't f****** touch me,\" the woman yelled. \"Why are you pushing me? Why are you shoving me? I am not following you!\"\nThe officer grabbed the observer and took her through solid double doors that lead to a freight elevator bay. The altercation continued:\n\"Why are you taking me?\" the woman shouted.\n\"Because you're following me around,\" the officer yelled.\n\"I am not following you around. Not everything is about you,\" the woman responded.\nThe officer and the woman disappeared down the elevator. Their voices trailed through the open door of the courtroom as proceedings continued.\nEOIR declined comment on the incident and referred questions regarding enforcements, access and security to DHS. DHS did not respond to a request for comment.\nSix feet away, several families were sitting in the waiting area waiting for their names to be called.\nLater, regular court observers said this was a quiet day in court.\n\u2014With reporting by Sarah Ventre and Isabella Gomez Sarmiento\nIf you have tips related immigration or the Department of Homeland Security, please contact Ximena Bustillo at xbustillo@npr.org.
