  "description": "From India to Iceland, nowhere is safe from air pollution. Here are the places with the dirtiest\u2014and cleanest\u2014air in the world.",
  "content": "Air pollution is among the greatest environmental threats to human health according to the World Health Organization (WHO), across not only low but also middle and high-income countries. It states that in 2019, 99% of the global population lived in areas that didn\u2019t meet its recommended air quality levels.\n\nThe 2024 State of Global Air report notes that air pollution accounted for 8.1 million deaths globally in 2021, becoming the second leading risk factor for death, including for children under five years. While there may not be a huge amount you can immediately do to change where you live, even if it suffers from significant air pollution, you can choose where you travel to. Knowledge, then, is power.\n\nIf you want to avoid places with some of the most polluted air on Earth, no matter how appealing they may feel as a destination, the latest World Air Quality report from Swiss air quality technology company IQAir can help you decide where to go\u2014and where not to\u2014with its rankings of the world\u2019s most and least polluted capital cities.\n\nThe report presents PM2.5 air quality data gathered from 8,954 cities across 138 territories, regions and countries. That data is provided by more than 40,000 regulatory air quality monitoring stations and sensors operated by everyone from government agencies to schools to citizen scientists around the world.\n\nPM2.5 is the name given to fine particulate matter in the air that\u2019s small enough to penetrate through the lungs and pass into our bloodstream (about three per cent the width of an average human hair) causing a range of health problems and diseases both to our cardiovascular and respiratory system, including stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nThe PM2.5 data is measured in micrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m\u00b3) and then calculated against the WHO PM2.5 air quality guideline of 5.0 \u00b5g/m\u00b3\u2014five micrograms of air pollutant per cubic meter of air. The air quality metrics in this 2024 report derive from IQAir\u2019s real-time online monitoring platform, which systematically validates, calibrates, and harmonizes data from air quality monitoring stations globally.\n\nCountries with the worst and best air quality\n\nThe ranking has some new entries in 2024, including Djibouti, Mozambique and Chad, which is ranked as the most polluted country overall. It is followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo and India as the five countries with the worst air pollution.\n\nOthers are missing from this year\u2019s report thanks to a lack of available data\u2014notably, Iran, Afghanistan and Burkina Faso, which was ranked as the fifth most polluted country from 2023 data.\n\nIncredibly, only 12 countries, regions and territories recorded PM2.5 concentrations below the WHO guideline figure of 5.0 \u00b5g/m\u00b3. Most of these were in Latin America, the Caribbean and Oceania regions. They include the cleanest five overall \u2013 Bahamas, Bermuda, French Polynesia, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Alongside a handful of other Caribbean countries, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Estonia and Iceland in Europe also make it onto the exclusive \u201cclean air\u201d list.\n\nThe U.S. ranks as the 22nd cleanest air country with an average PM2.5 concentration of 7.1 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, three places behind Canada (6.7 \u00b5g/m\u00b3) and three places ahead of the UK (7.4 \u00b5g/m\u00b3). None of the three meets the WHO guideline figure.\n\nThe most polluted capital cities in the world\n\nThe world\u2019s most polluted capitals have, in 2024, registered some startling and sobering air pollution levels.\n\nThe most polluted capital city is Delhi in India with an average PM2.5 concentration of 91.8 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 (remember the WHO guideline limit is 5.0 \u00b5g/m\u00b3.) Air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years according to the report. Over the course of 2024, Delhi had the worst average air quality\u2014although it\u2019s not alone with six of the world\u2019s ten most polluted cities in India.\n\nThe second most polluted capital is N\u2019Djamena in Chad, a country regularly taking the top spot as the most polluted anywhere (when reliable data is available.) It registered an average PM2.5 concentration of 91.6 \u00b5g/m\u00b3. A major source of air pollutants is mineral dust blowing in off the Sahara Desert, at its worst during the dry and windy Harmattan season from November to March.\n\nThe capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, is the third most polluted, registering an average PM2.5 concentration of 78.0 \u00b5g/m\u00b3\u2014more than 15 times the WHO guideline. Following it in fourth is Kinshasa, capital of D.R. Congo with an average PM2.5 concentration of 58.2 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 and just behind it in fifth, Islamabad in Pakistan registering 52.4 \u00b5g/m\u00b3.\n\nThe 10 least polluted capital cities in the world\n\nAt the other end of the scale, just 17% of global cities and eight capital cities meet WHO air pollution guidelines.\n\nTo see the full list and do a deep dive into air pollution and its impact around the world download and read the 2024 World Air Quality Report",

This comprehensive report presents PM2.5 air quality data collected from 8,954 cities across 138 countries, regions, and territories. The data used herein is sourced from over 40,000 regulatory air quality monitoring stations and low-cost sensors, operated by a diverse range of entities, including government agencies, research institutions, non-profit organizations, schools, universities, private sector companies, and dedicated citizen scientists worldwide.\nThe PM2.5 data is measured in micrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m\u00b3) and the data is visualized as a function of the World Health Organization (WHO) annual PM2.5 air quality guideline. The air quality metrics included in this 2024 report derive from IQAir\u2019s real-time online monitoring platform, which systematically validates, calibrates, and harmonizes data from air quality monitoring stations globally.\nFor further historic air quality information categorized by city, country, and region, the IQAir website offers an interactive map displaying annual city concentrations alongside global rankings of air quality for the 8,954 cities featured in this report. IQAir is committed to engaging, informing, and inspiring a collaborative effort among governments, educators, researchers, non-profit organizations, businesses, and citizens to elevate air quality awareness. Our goal is to facilitate informed dialogue and promote actions that enhance air quality and safeguard the health of communities and cities around the world.\nExecutive Summary\nAir pollution remains the greatest environmental threat to human health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 99% of the global population lives in areas that do not meet recommended air quality guideline levels.1 Air pollution is the second leading global risk factor for death, and the second leading risk factor for deaths among children under five, following malnutrition, due to its significant impact on respiratory and developmental health.2 In 2021 alone, 8.1 million total deaths were attributable to air pollution, with 58% of those deaths caused by ambient PM2.5 air pollution.3\nThe United Nations has declared access to healthy air is a universal human right.4 Exposure to PM2.5 contributes to and exacerbates various health conditions, including asthma, cancer, stroke, and lung diseases.5 In addition, exposure to elevated levels of fine particles during pregnancy and early childhood are associated with congenital heart defects, eczema and allergic disease, cognitive impairments and delays, neurodevelopmental disorders, and mental health disorders.6\nThe data used to create this report was compiled from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations and low-cost sensors worldwide, operated by research institutions, government agencies, schools, universities, non-profit organizations, private companies, and citizen scientists.\nThe 2023 World Air Quality Report included data from 7,812 locations in 134 countries, regions, and territories. In 2024, those numbers have grown to 8,954 cities in 138 countries, regions, and territories. Coverage has expanded in Africa to include Chad, the most polluted country in 2024, along with Djibouti and Mozambique. The countries of Iran, Afghanistan, and Burkina Faso (ranked 5th most polluted country in 2023) are notably absent in 2024 due to a lack of data availability.\nOnly 12 countries, regions, and territories recorded PM2.5 concentrations below the WHO annual PM2.5 guideline of 5.0 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, most of which were in the Latin America and Caribbean or Oceania region; however in 2024, 17% of cities included in the report met the WHO annual PM2.5 guideline level, up from 9% in 2023. While this marks some progress, much more work has yet to be done to protect human health, especially that of children. It is our shared responsibility to safeguard the health and well-being of the world\u2019s children, who will one day become the leaders of tomorrow. By equipping them with the knowledge and resources they need, we empower them to tackle the global challenges of the future.\nReferences\n[1] World Health Organization.

      "text": "Key facts\n- Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risks to child health\n- In 2019, 99% of the world\u2019s population was living in places where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were not met.\n- The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually.\n- Ambient (outdoor) air pollution is estimated to have caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019.\n- Some 89% of those premature deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions.\n- Policies and investments supporting cleaner transport, energy efficient homes, power generation, industry and better municipal waste management would reduce key sources of outdoor air pollution. Access to clean household energy would also greatly reduce ambient air pollution in some regions.\nOverview\nOutdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting everyone in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.\nAmbient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2019; this mortality is due to exposure to fine particulate matter, which causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers.\nWHO estimates that in 2019, some 68% of outdoor air pollution related premature deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke, 14% were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 14% were due to acute lower respiratory infections, and 4% of deaths were due to lung cancers.\nPeople living in low- and middle-income countries disproportionately experience the burden of outdoor air pollution with 89% (of the 4.2 million premature deaths) occurring in these areas. The greatest burden is found in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. The latest burden estimates reflect the significant role air pollution plays in cardiovascular illness and death.\nPolicies reducing air pollution\nAddressing air pollution, which is the second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases, is key to protecting public health.\nMost sources of outdoor air pollution are well beyond the control of individuals and this demands concerted action by local, national and regional level policy-makers working in sectors like energy, transport, waste management, urban planning and agriculture.\nThere are many examples of successful policies that reduce air pollution:\n- for industry: clean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions; improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as an alternative to incineration (for use as biogas);\n- for energy: ensuring access to affordable clean household energy solutions for cooking, heating and lighting;\n- for transport: shifting to clean modes of power generation; prioritizing rapid urban transit, walking and cycling networks in cities as well as rail interurban freight and passenger travel; shifting to cleaner heavy-duty diesel vehicles and low-emissions vehicles and fuels, including fuels with reduced sulfur content;\n- for urban planning: improving the energy efficiency of buildings and making cities more green and compact, and thus energy efficient;\n- for power generation: increased use of low-emissions fuels and renewable combustion-free power sources (like solar, wind or hydropower); co-generation of heat and power; and distributed energy generation (e.g. mini-grids and rooftop solar power generation);\n- for municipal and agricultural waste management: strategies for waste reduction, waste separation, recycling and reuse or waste reprocessing, as well as improved methods of biological waste management such as anaerobic waste digestion to produce biogas, are feasible, low-cost alternatives to the open incineration of solid waste \u2013 where incineration is unavoidable, then combustion technologies with strict emission controls are critical; and\n- for health-care activities: putting health services on a low-carbon development path can support more resilient and cost-efficient service delivery, along with reduced environmental health risks for patients, health workers and the community. In supporting climate friendly policies, the health sector can display public leadership while also improving health service delivery.\nPollutants\nParticulate matter (PM)\nPM is a common proxy indicator for air pollution. There is strong evidence for the negative health impacts associated with exposure to this pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water.\nCarbon monoxide (CO)\nCarbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless and tasteless toxic gas produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, charcoal, natural gas and kerosene.\nOzone (O3)\nOzone at ground level \u2013 not to be confused with the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere \u2013 is one of the major constituents of photochemical smog and it is formed through the reaction with gases in the presence of sunlight.\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2)\nNO2 is a gas that is commonly released from the combustion of fuels in the transportation and industrial sectors.\nSulfur dioxide (SO2)\nSO2 is a colourless gas with a sharp odour. It is produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulfur.\nTo read more details about these pollutants and other types, please visit this page.\nAir quality guidelines\nThe WHO Global air quality guidelines (AQG) offer global guidance on thresholds and limits for key air pollutants that pose health risks. These guidelines are of a high methodological quality and are developed through a transparent, evidence-based decision-making process. In addition to the guideline values, the WHO Global air quality guidelines provide interim targets to promote a gradual shift from high to lower concentrations and their associated health benefits. For example, through the achievement of interim target one (35 \u00b5g/m3), around 300 000 deaths would be saved worldwide annually.\nThe guidelines also offer qualitative statements on good practices for the management of certain types of particulate matter (PM), for example black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and particles originating from sand and dust storms, for which there is insufficient quantitative evidence to derive AQG levels.\nWHO response\nRecognizing the gravity and urgency of the problem, all WHO Member States approved resolution A68.8, \u201cHealth and the Environment: addressing the health impact of air pollution,\u201d at the World Health Assembly in 2015, complemented by a road map for action the following year.\nWHO, as the coordinating authority on international health, supports countries in protecting public health through evidence-based policies and actions. Considering the significant health burden and the multiple potential benefits of interventions, WHO supports countries by providing evidence, building institutional capacity and leveraging the health argument to convene sectors to tackle air pollution.\nTo support reducing air pollution levels and to protect populations from health\nrisks, WHO\u2019s Air Quality and Health Unit works in three cross-cutting areas:\n1. knowledge, evidence and measuring progress\n2. institutional capacity building and technical support\n3. leadership and coordination.\nMember States and sub-national entities are typically responsible for the implementation and\nmonitoring of policies to promote air quality for health. Successful policies\nand solid governance depend on coordinated action between a variety of stakeholders and sec-\ntors. Cooperation with other UN agencies and non-state actors is essential and is integrated\ninto WHO\u2019s work to ensure synergies and maximize impact on the ground.\nA full list of WHO\u2019s activities to combat ambient air pollution can be found here and here."

      "text": "What are the WHO Air quality guidelines?\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s Air quality guidelines (AQG) serve as a global target for national, regional and city governments to work towards improving their citizen\u2019s health by reducing air pollution.\nWhy does WHO publish Air quality guidelines?\nClean air is a basic human right. Yet, air pollution continues to pose a significant threat to people worldwide \u2013 it is the greatest environmental threat to health and a leading cause of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart attacks or stroke. According to the World Health Organization, there are 7 million premature deaths every year due to the combined effects of outdoor and household air pollution\u2013 with millions more people falling ill from breathing polluted air. More than half of these deaths are recorded in developing countries.\nWHO regularly integrates scientific evidence on air pollution\u2019s health impacts as well as monitors countries air quality progress. The recommendations included in the WHO Air quality guidelines are based on systematic literature reviews and subsequent rigorous evaluation methods as well as extensive consultation with experts and end-users of the guidelines from all regions of the world.\nAhead of the publication of the 2021 WHO Air Quality guidelines, here is a breakdown of what they are and how governments can use them.\nWhat is air pollution?\nAir pollution is a complex mixture of solid particles, liquid droplets, as well as gases. It can come from many sources for example: household fuel burning, industrial chimneys, traffic exhausts, power generation, open burning of waste, agricultural practices, desert dust and many other sources.\nDifferent sources can lead to different mixtures of air pollution. For example, an urban city near to the sea can have particulate matter consisting of sea salt, road dust and smoke from diesel engines. In contrast, a rural area near to a forest may have particulate matter consisting of soil, smoke from cookstoves and forest fires.\nAir pollutants measured include PM2.5 and PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of equal or less than 2.5, also called fine, and 10 micrometre respectively), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).\nWhat is the effects of air pollution on human health?\nFine particulate matter (PM2.5) can penetrate through the lungs and further enter the body through the blood stream, affecting all major organs.\nExposure to PM2.5 can cause diseases both to our cardiovascular and respiratory system, provoking, for example stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nNew research has also shown an association between prenatal exposure to high levels of air pollution and developmental delay at age three, as well as psychological and behavioural problems later on, including symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depression.\nHow are the guidelines developed?\nThe WHO Air quality guidelines are a set of evidence-based recommendations of limit values for specific air pollutants developed to help countries achieve air quality that protects public health. The first release of the guidelines was in 1987. Since then, several updated versions have appeared and the latest global version was published in 2005. WHO updates the Air Quality Guidelines on a regular basis so as to assure their continued relevance and to support a broad range of policy options for air-quality management in various parts of the world, especially taking into account the breadth of new health studies that have been published in the meanwhile.\nThe 2021 update of the WHO air quality guidelines is in response to the real and continued threat of air pollution to public health.\nAccording to WHO rules and procedures for guidelines development, several expert groups are established, each one with a very specific function. The selection of which pollutants to update is agreed upon by one group, in this case, particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Other teams of experts draft the background material \u2014 the literature reviews and its assessment\u2014 which is reviewed and commented by the main group of experts.\nBased on the background materials and the comments, another Expert Group agrees on the format and contents of the updated guidelines and recommended changes in the text supporting the guidelines.\nWhat do the guidelines recommend?\nThe WHO Air quality guidelines recommend levels and interim targets for common air pollutants: PM, O3, NO2, and SO2.\nRecommended 2021 AQG levels compared to 2005 air quality guidelines\n\u03bcg = microgram\na 99th percentile (i.e. 3\u20134 exceedance days per year).\nb Average of daily maximum 8-hour mean O3 concentration in the six consecutive months with the highest six-month running- average O3 concentration.\nNote: Annual and peak season is long-term exposure, while 24 hour and 8 hour is short-term exposure.\nHow can governments use them?\nGovernments across the world use the guidelines in different ways depending on their technical capabilities, economic capacity, air quality management policies and other political and social factors. Before adopting the WHO guideline values as legally based standards, governments should consider their unique, local conditions.\nWhat do the guidelines aim to achieve?\nAlthough the guidelines are neither standards nor legally binding criteria, they are designed to offer guidance in reducing the health impacts of air pollution based on expert evaluation of current scientific evidence.\nThese guidelines incorporate scientific evidence from multiple countries, which makes them relevant to the diverse conditions around the world and capable of supporting a broad range of policy options for air quality management.\nThey are intended to be used in diverse conditions in all WHO\u2019s regions and to support a broad range of policy options for air quality management. Knowledge about the hazardous properties of the pollutants and indication of the risk related to exposure, provide an essential scientific contribution for air quality management.\nSignificant health benefits can be achieved by reducing a population\u2019s exposure to air pollution. Addressing air pollution through policy actions in energy, transport, waste management, agriculture and urban planning can also uncover additional co-benefits for health, climate mitigation and sustainable economic development.\nAdditional resources:\nAir quality guidelines global update 2021\nAir quality guidelines global update 2005\nWHO Factsheet: Ambient (outdoor) air pollution"

The analysis finds that:\n\u25cf Air pollution accounted for 8.1 million deaths globally in 2021, becoming the second leading risk factor for death, including for children under five years. Of the total deaths, noncommunicable diseases including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) account for nearly 90% of the disease burden from air pollution.\n\u25cf In 2021, more than 700,000 deaths in children under 5 years were linked to air pollution; this represents 15% of all global deaths in children under five.\nAs in previous years, the State of Global Air 2024 report and accompanying website provides comprehensive data on the levels and trends in air quality and health for every country in the world. This State of Global Air report was produced in partnership with UNICEF. In the State of Global Air 2024 interactive app, you can explore, compare, and download data and graphics reflecting the latest air pollution levels and associated burden of disease for over 200 individual countries, territories, and regions, as well as track trends from 1990 to 2021."

  "argos_summary": "Air pollution remains the world\u2019s leading environmental health threat, with 99% of the global population living in areas that exceed WHO\u2019s PM2.5 guideline of 5\u202f\u00b5g/m\u00b3 and causing 8.1\u202fmillion deaths in 2021, including 700,000 under\u2011five fatalities. The 2024 IQAir World Air Quality Report, drawing on data from 8,954 cities and 40,000+ monitoring stations, ranks Delhi, N\u2019Djamena, Dhaka, Kinshasa and Islamabad as the most polluted capitals, while only 12 countries achieve PM2.5 levels below the WHO threshold. The report highlights the need for coordinated policy action across energy, transport, waste management and urban planning to reduce emissions and protect public health, especially in low\u2011 and middle\u2011income regions where the burden is greatest.",
