  "content": "\u2022 Microsoft and Shopify have outperformed broader equities this year.\n\u2022 Microsoft's strong cloud and AI businesses, as well as its solid dividend program, make the stock attractive.\n\u2022 Shopify has gained significant traction in e-commerce and still has ample growth prospects.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Microsoft \u203a When a company's shares go on a run, it's reasonable to wonder whether they are still worth investing in. That's a question we can ask about Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP), two tech leaders that have been on a tear this year. The former is up 20% since January, while the latter has climbed 27%. Is there any upside left? In my view, the answer is a resounding yes. Not only can both companies still deliver superior returns, but they also have many of the qualities required of \"forever stocks.\" Let's dig in. Microsoft is firing on all cylinders. The company's revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2025, which ended on June 30, increased 18% year over year to $76.4 billion. On the profitability front, earnings per share rose 24% year over year, to $3.65. To no one's surprise, the company's cloud division had a lot to do with this strong performance. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew significantly faster -- 39% versus 30% the same period last year. Microsoft is increasingly gaining on its competitor in the cloud industry, namely Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which currently holds the spot. Furthermore, the numbers indicate that there is still significant room for growth for the company. Microsoft had $368 billion in contracted revenue on its books as of the end of the period, representing a 37% increase year over year. Had Microsoft not seized the cloud opportunity when it did, choosing instead to focus on its operating system (OS) offerings, it would be a different company today. Although there is nothing wrong with its legacy OS business, it has been supplanted as Microsoft's most important growth driver by cloud computing and artificial intelligence, two industries that are expected to maintain an upward momentum for a very long time. That tells us several things about Microsoft: It is a well-run, innovative company with attractive growth prospects. Add the company's moat, derived from its brand name and switching costs, and Microsoft looks likely to continue offering competitive returns over the next five years and beyond. Lastly, Microsoft is a terrific dividend stock: Don't let its meager 0.7% forward yield fool you.\n\nMicrosoft generates significant amounts of cash flow, has ample funds to more than cover its annual dividend payments -- as evidenced by its conservative cash payout ratio of 33.6% -- and has increased its payouts by 130.6% over the past decade. Microsoft is a no-brainer for growth and dividend stocks that investors can park in their portfolios for the long term. Shopify experienced a slump after reaching its all-time high in late 2021, which lasted approximately a year. Since 2023, the company has been on fire. Several changes to its business have allowed it to get back on track. Shopify increased its prices after more than a decade of not doing so. The company also got rid of its expensive logistics business. The result: Rebounding revenue growth, expanding margin, and the occasional net profit. Shopify had most of those during the second quarter. Revenue increased 31% year over year to $2.7 billion, while its net income came in at $906 million, which was much better than the $171 million reported in the year-ago period. Shopify's free cash flow jumped by 26.7% to $422 million, while free cash flow margin remained flat at 16%. Shopify should experience growing demand for its services over the long term as the e-commerce market continues to expand. The company has already established itself as a leader in its niche, helping merchants build online storefronts. Shopify's platform makes it easy for merchants to get started and offers a rich suite of services ideally adapted to the demands of modern commerce, so they can focus on running their businesses. That's why Shopify's customer count has been growing at a good clip for a while, and it has grabbed more than 12% share of the U.S. e-commerce market by gross merchandise volume. Further, it also benefits from a moat thanks to switching costs and network effects. Shopify wants to be a 100-year company. This long journey has, so far, started well, and there should be plenty of upside for investors who stay the course. Shopify looks like an excellent forever stock.

      "text": "Artificial intelligence uses machines -- generally, computers -- to mimic human intelligence. Although there are debates about its utility, AI has become common in applications that range from the creation of generative chatbots to the selections displayed in your Netflix queue. Read on to learn more about this rapidly growing field and what it might mean for your investment portfolio.\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nOnce a staple of science fiction -- think, Frankenstein -- artificial intelligence, or AI, is commonly used by billions of people. Although there\u2019s no set definition, it\u2019s generally agreed that artificial intelligence is the use of computers to mimic human judgment. These days, it\u2019s used by almost every industry, often in ways that are too subtle to be noticed.\nCategories\nCategories of artificial intelligence\nThere are three basic categories of artificial intelligence:\n- Narrow AI: Artificial intelligence can be built for very specific tasks, such as playing a game, keeping spam out of your inbox, helping you find a nearby restaurant with your smartphone, or even driving your car.\n- General AI: With more resemblance to human capabilities, general artificial intelligence is a more advanced form that can involve visual and language processing, contextual understanding, and the ability to adapt to a range of tasks. It\u2019s considered to be far off in the future.\n- Artificial super AI: Imagine a machine that\u2019s smarter than you -- much smarter. Artificial superintelligence is still only a theory, but advances in nascent AI are raising interesting and troubling questions for the future of humanity.\nTypes\nTypes of artificial intelligence\nThe proliferation of data and other online resources has caused an explosion in the use of artificial intelligence. But not all AI is equal. We'll look at four different types of artificial intelligence to give you an idea of how it's developed and how AI is being used.\nMachine Learning\n1. Machine learning\nThe idea behind machine learning is to use sample data to train computer programs to recognize patterns based on algorithms. Machine learning programs allow computers to do things without being programmed. The efficiency of machine learning generally depends on the algorithm.\nA relatively common use of machine learning happens if you have a Pinterest (PINS 1.99%) account. The image-sharing and social media website began using machine learning with the acquisition of Kosei in 2015; since then, it's employed machine learning to help users discover content, moderate spam, direct advertising, and target newsletters.\n2. Neural networks\nNeural networks are computer systems designed to imitate the neurons in a brain. The networks are designed to learn via processing examples, using a well-understood input and a predicted result. As the network gains experience, its output mirrors the targeted result.\nAlphabet (GOOGL 3.1%)(GOOG 2.98%), the parent company of search giant Google, for example, has been researching neural networks since 2014. Its DeepMind project seeks to use artificial intelligence to build even more powerful algorithms. The project is best known for its neural network that learned how to play 49 different Atari video games by viewing pixels and a score on a screen.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n3. Natural language processing\nNatural language processing is often confused with simple speech recognition. It certainly includes the ability to understand speech, but it involves more than simple audio-to-text (and vice versa) translations. One of the goals of natural language processing is the design of a computer to fully understand and analyze documents.\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) has become a major player in the field since investing $13 billion in OpenAI, the startup that created ChatGPT. Its Azure is the sole cloud provider for the generative chatbot and offers sentiment analysis, text classification, and text summarization, among others.\n4. Robotics\nThe use of robots dates back hundreds of years, but machines that could assist people without actual human involvement are considerably newer. One of the first autonomous robots was installed in 1961 and used to lift hot pieces of metal from a machine. Since then, robots have become far more common. They're used in applications ranging from space exploration to vacuuming your carpet.\nRobotics has evolved beyond industrial uses and are used in a wide range of applications, including medicine. The da Vinci system created by Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.22%), for example, is used for a wide range of procedures, including cardiac valve, prostate, and gynecological surgeries.\nRelated investing topics\nImportance of artificial intelligence\nImportance of artificial intelligence\nObviously, artificial intelligence has enormous ramifications for almost every human endeavor that you can imagine -- including investing. Imagine a robo-advisor that automatically tracks your portfolio and maximizes its value by making immediate and personalized adjustments based on corporate earnings calls, currency fluctuations, or even weather forecasts.\nIt\u2019s a tempting vision, but one with downsides. Artificial intelligence costs money, making it (for now) the province of wealthy corporations. Even AI designers can\u2019t anticipate every potential pitfall. And, of course, there\u2019s always the end-of-the-world scenario where AI winds up deciding that humans just aren\u2019t worth the trouble (think \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cTerminator\u201d movies).\nMany questions related to AI are just now being asked; they may be decades from being answered. But it\u2019s a good idea to keep track of this megatrend, which stands to affect the world in ways that we likely can\u2019t yet imagine."

      "text": "Cloud computing boomed during the 2010s, but growth in this next-gen IT industry is still in the early innings. For years, organizations around the globe have been migrating their operations to the cloud -- digital data and services stored within a remote data center and accessed via the internet. However, the rise of remote work during the pandemic accelerated the trend. Now, generative AI has kicked off the next wave of cloud expansion.\nBusiness research provider Grand View Research projects that spending on global cloud computing (including data center infrastructure and edge computing) will increase at a 21.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from an estimated $752.4 billion in 2024 to $2.4 trillion in 2030.\nCloud computing is also closely tied to other tech developments such as mobile 5G networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). Clearly, cloud computing stocks are a top investment theme for 2025 and the decade ahead.\nCloud computing stocks for 2025\nInvesting in the best cloud computing stocks of 2025\nTo get started, the best cloud stocks to invest in are the five largest public cloud giants: Amazon (AMZN 3.12%) Web Services (AWS); Microsoft (MSFT 0.56%) Azure; Alphabet (GOOGL 3.1%) (GOOG 2.98%) Google Cloud; Oracle (ORCL 1.3%) Cloud; and IBM (IBM 0.94%) Cloud. Although these companies aren\u2019t pure plays in the cloud industry, all five provide infrastructure and services for organizations undertaking a digital transformation (a phrase that encompasses the migration to cloud-based operations). They have the most complete ecosystems of software and partnerships with third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.\nCloud Computing\nBeyond those big five, here are seven more focused companies that provide portfolio exposure to the development of the cloud:\n| Name and ticker | Current price | Market cap |\n|---|---|---|\n| Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) | $248.06 | $237 billion |\n| Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) | $362.02 | $154 billion |\n| Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) | $196.77 | $66 billion |\n| Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) | $82.46 | $25 billion |\n| ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) | $885.83 | $184 billion |\n| The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) | $53.19 | $26 billion |\n| DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) | $31.54 | $3 billion |\n1 - 2\n1. Salesforce\nWhen talking about cloud computing, Salesforce (CRM 0.91%) needs to be part of the conversation. The customer relationship management (CRM) specialist was a pioneer of software that used cloud technology, which started in the late 1990s. Salesforce has since branched out to other areas of enterprise software via organic growth and a steady stream of acquisitions.\nSalesforce\u2019s takeover of remote work and collaboration tool Slack put it on a collision course with Microsoft\u2019s Teams collaboration suite. Today, Salesforce offers a complete suite of software aimed at helping business teams manage data and get work done efficiently.\nDue to its success in becoming a full-blown tech platform for businesses of all types and sizes, Salesforce is also a top way to play smaller cloud upstarts. It regularly invests in or acquires stakes in smaller cloud peers -- such as when it invested in Snowflake (SNOW 1.07%) before its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020 (and sold it for a profit in 2021). It also acquired a stake in hot IPO Monday.com (MNDY 3.67%).\nSalesforce fell on hard times in 2022 and faced activist investor pressure to boost profit margins. Founder and CEO Marc Benioff and the top team have made progress, though, and hope to become the world\u2019s largest and most profitable enterprise software company within the next few years. It seems to be on the right track. Salesforce reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.21 for fiscal 2023 but booked diluted EPS of $4.20 in fiscal 2024, and management projects fiscal 2025 to be even higher: $6.15 to $6.20.\n2. Adobe\nSoftware company Adobe (ADBE 2.43%) got its start in an IT era that predates both the cloud and the internet. But it has transformed itself into a leader in cloud services by adapting its large and expanding platform to the cloud era. Adobe\u2019s core competencies in providing creativity software and document editing have made it a staple of digital transformation.\nAlthough it isn\u2019t a serial acquirer like Salesforce, Adobe has made some big moves to round out its software suite. In 2018, it acquired small firms Marketo and Magento to bolster its position as a partner for e-commerce companies. In late 2020, it purchased Workfront to add workflow and project management solutions to its arsenal.\nAs a creative software specialist, Adobe is also well suited to tackle the new generative AI era. Its work with top chip designer Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) helped it quickly release its Firefly suite of apps aimed at helping creatives increase their image and video creation, as well as expanding editing capabilities.\nPaired with the organic growth that Adobe\u2019s legacy offerings still generate, this firm is a top free cash flow generator in the cloud industry. It deserves consideration as a core portfolio holding.\n3 - 4\n3. Snowflake\nThe cloud increases a company's flexibility, often unlocks cost savings, and helps them get more done with the data they have on their operations and customers. However, with the adoption of the cloud comes an explosion of digital data and new security risk considerations. Managing that data is a complex task.\nThat's where Snowflake comes in. It hit the public markets in 2020 with incredible fanfare due to its triple-digit-percentage revenue growth. The stock has fallen since then, and revenue growth has moderated a bit, but Snowflake is now much more reasonably valued.\nSnowflake is an important business that has pioneered new ways for businesses to store, migrate, and process massive amounts of digital information. It continued to expand at a rapid pace even during the bear market of 2022 and despite fears of a recession in 2023. It also began turning a healthy profit, as measured by free cash flow. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, for example, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $496.5 million and $778.9 million, respectively. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, moreover, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $468.6 million.\nSnowflake is a young company, though, and the stock will likely be highly volatile for some time. It's all about growth for this business right now, and even small changes in management's expectations can cause some wild fluctuations in share price. Snowflake could, nevertheless, be a very promising investment for the long term.\n4. Zoom Video Communications\nFew companies have skyrocketed out of obscurity and into household name status as quickly as Zoom (ZM 12.7%). The videoconferencing service became a staple during the COVID-19 pandemic by helping family members and business teams stay in touch from afar (as it turns out, many pre-pandemic in-person meetings weren't all that necessary after all). Zoom is poised to continue as a basic necessity of corporate communications services for a long time.\nZoom is eyeing a bigger piece of the massive global telecom industry by going after large business communications accounts. Zoom Phone accounts, a service for transferring calls across different devices, has steadily grown for years. Zoom's contact center services to manage inbound calls and customer contact have also remained a key growth initiative.\nWhile Zoom struggled with many individual and small business subscribers canceling their service in the wake of the pandemic, it has succeeded in improving its financials over the past couple of years. Growing free cash flow from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024, Zoom projects free cash flow of $1.44 billion to $1.48 billion for fiscal 2025. The company is still benefiting from changes in communications, but it's no longer a growth company. Zoom's top priority now is managing modest revenue expansion while figuring out how to steadily increase earnings for shareholders.\nArtificial Intelligence\n5 - 7\n5. ServiceNow\nThere are greater complexities involved in managing big cloud computing infrastructure, but the cloud also offers the ability to continuously streamline and automate operations. That's ServiceNow's (NOW 1.01%) software specialty.\nBe it digital customer experiences, employee workflow management, or software development, ServiceNow helps about 8,400 companies around the world find chokepoints in their operations. Once these pain points are found, ServiceNow can help suggest and automate fixes.\nIn a new era of AI, ServiceNow could be a big winner, building on its recent success. After growing subscription revenue by 23% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, ServiceNow projects a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of about 19% for fiscal 2025.\nThe company is using Nvidia hardware to make automation even better and even landed Nvidia as a bigger customer using automation software that Nvidia is helping ServiceNow to create. With challenges like labor shortages persisting in the wake of the pandemic, ServiceNow is primed to keep growing.\nIn addition to steady growth, ServiceNow also recently turned profitable by all metrics. This could be a great stock holding for the next decade and beyond as the cloud infiltrates more of the world's corporate operations.\n6. The Trade Desk\nNetflix (NFLX -0.2%) made streaming TV from the cloud an everyday staple. Lots of new internet-based services have come to market in the past couple of years. This has been a boon for digital advertising technologists such as The Trade Desk (TTD 1.7%), a cloud-based offering that helps marketers automate the purchase of digital advertising (known as programmatic advertising).\nDigital ads are dominated by the likes of Google and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), but The Trade Desk\u2019s cloud-based marketing management tools have won over lots of users. It now ranks as the largest independent digital ad management software company. And its rapidly-escalating top-line growth further reflects the massive success it has achieved. From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2023, for example, The Trade Desk has grown revenue at a massive 52% CAGR.\nDespite massive internet growth in the past decade, just over half of marketing spending takes place in a digital format. Digital ads will continue to be a fast-growing industry in the next decade -- especially in at-home entertainment as TV and movies move to an on-demand internet streaming format.\nIn the coming years, streaming services will pick up millions of new household subscribers and account for billions of additional hours spent viewing content. That creates a huge opportunity for The Trade Desk as it manages connected TV advertising activity. Still a small company in a global marketing industry approaching $1 trillion annually and growing, the sky\u2019s the limit for The Trade Desk.\n7. DigitalOcean\nDigitalOcean (NASDAQ:DOCN) is a fresh face in the cloud computing space. It completed its public offering of stock in early 2021. It\u2019s a public cloud infrastructure and software provider similar to Amazon\u2019s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. While the big three focus their attention on large enterprises, DigitalOcean aims at the massive but underserved community of small businesses and start-ups.\nThis is a lucrative niche. Most IT innovations are developed for and funded by large organizations. Yet small businesses still make up about half of the global economy\u2019s production. Most are far behind the curve in making needed digital transformation. That\u2019s where DigitalOcean comes in, providing a full range of affordable services to help small companies find their way in the new cloud era.\nBesides offering cloud infrastructure for small businesses to test and host web-based services and apps, it also offers services for the non-tech-savvy outfit. It acquired a company called Cloudways that offers website building and hosting.\nDespite its tiny size, DigitalOcean is an efficient operation. It generates healthy and growing free cash flow, and while it has generated gross profits for years, it booked positive net income for the first time in 2023, reporting diluted EPS of $0.20. Through the first three quarters of 2024, DigitalOcean has generated diluted EPS of $0.70. This could be a quality small- to mid-cap stock worth investing in for the long haul.\nInvesting in cloud ETFs\nInvesting in cloud ETFs\nFor investors not interested in attempting to pick the best cloud stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also an option. The First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY 2.62%) is the largest cloud ETF around, with about $3.9 billion in assets under management. The fund is a basket of 61 cloud infrastructure and software stocks. It has an ETF expense ratio of 0.6%, meaning it costs $6 per year for every $1,000 invested.\nA more recent arrival is the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU 3.54%). Since the fund launched in early 2019, GlobalX\u2019s cloud ETF has narrowly outperformed First Trust\u2019s offering due to its focus on just 37 stocks, most of which are software companies. The fund is smaller, with about $376 million in assets under management. It has a slightly higher annual expense ratio of 0.68%.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nCloud computing is a long-term growth trend\nCloud computing picked up steam during the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained an enduring growth story even during the bear market. More efficient than legacy IT, it enhances technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and gaming. It gives organizations and their employees more flexibility with important functions such as remote work. The cloud is quickly becoming the basic infrastructure of the future.\nAs is the case with all high-growth stocks, though, investing in cloud companies will have bumps in the road. Investors should stay focused on the long-term potential, not just stock price performance over the course of a year or two. This long-term secular growth trend is poised to remain intact for the next decade and beyond. Cloud stocks should be a top investment priority in 2025."

      "text": "When a company's shares go on a run, it's reasonable to wonder whether they are still worth investing in. That's a question we can ask about Microsoft (MSFT 0.56%) and Shopify (SHOP 3.97%), two tech leaders that have been on a tear this year. The former is up 20% since January, while the latter has climbed 27%. Is there any upside left?\nIn my view, the answer is a resounding yes. Not only can both companies still deliver superior returns, but they also have many of the qualities required of \"forever stocks.\" Let's dig in.\n1. Microsoft\nMicrosoft is firing on all cylinders. The company's revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2025, which ended on June 30, increased 18% year over year to $76.4 billion. On the profitability front, earnings per share rose 24% year over year, to $3.65. To no one's surprise, the company's cloud division had a lot to do with this strong performance. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew significantly faster -- 39% versus 30% the same period last year.\nMicrosoft is increasingly gaining on its competitor in the cloud industry, namely Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which currently holds the spot. Furthermore, the numbers indicate that there is still significant room for growth for the company. Microsoft had $368 billion in contracted revenue on its books as of the end of the period, representing a 37% increase year over year.\nHad Microsoft not seized the cloud opportunity when it did, choosing instead to focus on its operating system (OS) offerings, it would be a different company today. Although there is nothing wrong with its legacy OS business, it has been supplanted as Microsoft's most important growth driver by cloud computing and artificial intelligence, two industries that are expected to maintain an upward momentum for a very long time.\nThat tells us several things about Microsoft: It is a well-run, innovative company with attractive growth prospects. Add the company's moat, derived from its brand name and switching costs, and Microsoft looks likely to continue offering competitive returns over the next five years and beyond. Lastly, Microsoft is a terrific dividend stock: Don't let its meager 0.7% forward yield fool you.\nMicrosoft generates significant amounts of cash flow, has ample funds to more than cover its annual dividend payments -- as evidenced by its conservative cash payout ratio of 33.6% -- and has increased its payouts by 130.6% over the past decade. Microsoft is a no-brainer for growth and dividend stocks that investors can park in their portfolios for the long term.\n2. Shopify\nShopify experienced a slump after reaching its all-time high in late 2021, which lasted approximately a year. Since 2023, the company has been on fire. Several changes to its business have allowed it to get back on track. Shopify increased its prices after more than a decade of not doing so. The company also got rid of its expensive logistics business. The result: Rebounding revenue growth, expanding margin, and the occasional net profit.\nShopify had most of those during the second quarter. Revenue increased 31% year over year to $2.7 billion, while its net income came in at $906 million, which was much better than the $171 million reported in the year-ago period. Shopify's free cash flow jumped by 26.7% to $422 million, while free cash flow margin remained flat at 16%.\nShopify should experience growing demand for its services over the long term as the e-commerce market continues to expand. The company has already established itself as a leader in its niche, helping merchants build online storefronts. Shopify's platform makes it easy for merchants to get started and offers a rich suite of services ideally adapted to the demands of modern commerce, so they can focus on running their businesses.\nThat's why Shopify's customer count has been growing at a good clip for a while, and it has grabbed more than 12% share of the U.S. e-commerce market by gross merchandise volume. Further, it also benefits from a moat thanks to switching costs and network effects. Shopify wants to be a 100-year company. This long journey has, so far, started well, and there should be plenty of upside for investors who stay the course. Shopify looks like an excellent forever stock."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
