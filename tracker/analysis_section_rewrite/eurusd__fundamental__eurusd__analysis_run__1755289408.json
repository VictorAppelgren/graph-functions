      "feedback": "The draft is clear but a bit verbose and repeats the same idea several times. Tighten the paragraph by removing the second mention of “walnut shells” and the repeated description of winter vs all‑season tread. Keep the causal chain concise: harsh winter → need for traction → Toyo’s testing → walnut shells baked into compound → higher friction without road damage. Replace the generic “high levels of friction” with the article’s wording “generate high levels of friction” and note that no numeric improvement is given. Merge the market transmission and regime discussion into one sentence: “Drivers in snowy regions switch to dedicated winter tires, creating a seasonal demand spike for high‑traction tires.” Remove the separate “invariant constraint” and “medium‑term catalysts” sections; instead, combine them into a single risk/catalyst sentence. Finally, end with a brief confidence statement (“moderate confidence”) and a single sentence on key risks and signals. This will make the analysis more focused and easier to read.",
