  "title": "ChatGPT\u2019s model picker is back, and it\u2019s complicated",
  "description": "GPT-5 was supposed to get rid of all the complicated AI models to choose from in ChatGPT, but that's not how it's panned out.",
  "content": "When OpenAI launched GPT-5 last week, the company said the model would simplify the ChatGPT experience. OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of \u201cone size fits all\u201d AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eradicate the need for users to navigate its model picker \u2014 a long, complicated list of AI models that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said he hates \u2014 to pick a version of ChatGPT that offers the right kind of responses.\n\nBut it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.\n\nAltman said in a post on X Tuesday that the company introduced new \u201cAuto\u201d, \u201cFast\u201d, and \u201cThinking\u201d settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5\u2019s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.\n\nAlongside GPT-5\u2019s new modes, Altman said that paid users can once again access several legacy AI models \u2014 including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3 \u2014 which were deprecated just last week.\n\n\u201cWe are working on an update to GPT-5\u2019s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,\u201d Altman wrote in the post on X. \u201cHowever, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5\u2019s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5\u2019s rollout has been rougher than expected.\n\nThe deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a backlash among users who had grown attached to the AI models\u2019 responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.",

      "text": "OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3, which was slated to be the company\u2019s next major AI model, in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \u201csimplified\u201d product offering.\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, Altman said that in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \u201cintegrates a lot of [OpenAI\u2019s] technology,\u201d including o3, in its AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT and API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to launch o3 as a stand-alone model.\nThe company originally said in December that it aimed to release o3 sometime early this year. Just a few weeks ago, Kevin Weil, OpenAI\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview that o3 was on track for a \u201cFebruary-March\u201d launch.\n\u201cWe want to do a better job of sharing our intended roadmap, and a much better job simplifying our product offerings,\u201d Altman wrote in his post. \u201cWe want AI to \u2018just work\u2019 for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten. We hate the model picker [in ChatGPT] as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence.\u201d\nAltman also announced that OpenAI plans to offer unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the \u201cstandard intelligence setting,\u201d subject to \u201cabuse thresholds,\u201d once the model is generally available. (Altman declined to provide more detail on what this setting \u2014 and these abuse thresholds \u2014 entail.) Subscribers to ChatGPT Plus will be able to run GPT-5 at a \u201chigher level of intelligence,\u201d Altman said, while ChatGPT Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at an \u201ceven higher level of intelligence.\u201d\n\u201c[GPT-5] will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research, and more,\u201d he added, referring to a range of features OpenAI has launched in ChatGPT over the past few months. \u201c[A] top goal for us is to unify [our] models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.\u201d\nBefore GPT-5 rolls out, OpenAI plans to release GPT-4.5, a model code-named \u201cOrion,\u201d in the next several weeks, according to Altman. Altman says this will be the company\u2019s last \u201cnon-chain-of-thought model.\u201d Unlike o3 and OpenAI\u2019s other \u201creasoning\u201d models, non-chain-of-thought models tend to be less reliable in domains like math and physics.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Reasoning models effectively fact-check themselves, which helps them to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. This fact-checking process incurs some latency \u2014 reasoning models take a little longer, usually seconds to minutes longer, to arrive at solutions. But they tend to be both more reliable and capable.\nChinese AI lab DeepSeek captured the world\u2019s attention recently with its R1 model, which matched o1 on a number of benchmarks. As opposed to o1, R1 is an \u201copen\u201d model under a permissive license, meaning it can be downloaded and used as developers see fit.\nIn recent social media posts, Altman admitted that DeepSeek has lessened OpenAI\u2019s technological lead in AI, and said that OpenAI would \u201cpull up some releases\u201d to better compete.\nGPT-4.5, or Orion, is said to have suffered a number of performance-related challenges and technical setbacks. Bloomberg, The Information, and The Wall Street Journal have independently reported that Orion has shown less of an improvement over its predecessor, GPT-4o, than GPT-4 did over GPT-3."

      "text": "ChatGPT fans are shredding GPT-5 on Reddit as Sam Altman responds in AMA (updated)\nGPT-5 is out, the early reviews are in, and they're not great.\nMany ChatGPT fans have taken to Reddit and other social media platforms to express their frustration and disappointment with OpenAI's newest foundation model, released on Thursday.\nA quick glimpse of the ChatGPT subreddit (which is not affiliated with OpenAI) shows scathing reviews of GPT-5. Since the model began rolling out, the subreddit has filled with posts calling GPT-5 a \"disaster,\" \"horrible,\" and the \"biggest piece of garbage even as a paid user.\"\nAwkwardly, Altman and other members of the OpenAI team had a preplanned Reddit AMA to answer questions about GPT-5. In the hours ahead of the AMA, questions piled up in anticipation, with many users demanding that OpenAI bring back GPT-4o as an alternative to GPT-5.\nWhat Redditors are saying about GPT-5\nMany of the negative first impressions say GPT-5 lacks the \"personality\" of GPT-4o, citing colder, shorter replies. \"GPT-4o had this\u2026 warmth. It was witty, creative, and surprisingly personal, like talking to someone who got you. It didn\u2019t just spit out answers; it felt like it listened,\" said one redditor. \"Now? Everything\u2019s so\u2026 sterile.\"\nAnother said, \"GPT-5 lacks the essence and soul that separated Chatgpt (sic) from other AI bots. I sincerely wish they bring back 4o as a legacy model or something like that.\"\nSeveral redditors also criticized the fact that OpenAI did away with the option to choose different models, prompting some users to say they're canceling their subscriptions. \"I woke up this morning to find that OpenAI deleted 8 models overnight. No warning. No choice. No \"legacy option,\" posted one redditor who said they deleted their ChatGPT Plus account. Another user posted that they canceled their account for the same reason.\nAs Mashable reported yesterday, GPT-5 integrates various OpenAI models into one platform, and ChatGPT will now choose the appropriate model based on the user's prompt. Clearly, some users miss the old system and models.\nIronically, OpenAI has also drawn criticism for having too many model options; GPT-5 was supposed to resolve this confusion by streamlining the previous models under GPT-5.\nSam Altman responds to the criticisms\nWhen Altman and the team logged onto the AMA, they faced a barrage of demands to bring back GPT-4o.\n\"Ok, we hear you all on 4o,\" said Altman during the AMA. \"Thanks for the time to give us the feedback (and the passion!). We are going to bring it back for Plus users, and will watch usage to determine how long to support it.\"\nAltman also addressed feedback that GPT-5 seemed dumber than it should have been, explaining that the \"autoswitcher\" that determines which version of GPT-5 to use wasn't working. \"GPT-5 will seem smarter starting today,\" he said. Altman also added that the chatbot will make it clearer which model is answering a user's prompt. OpenAI will double rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users once the rollout is finished.\n\u201cAs we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!\u201d Altman said in the AMA.\nGPT-5 is an improvement, but not an exponential one\nExpectations for GPT-5 could not have been higher \u2014 and that may be the real problem with GPT-5.\nGary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and author known for his research on neuroscience and artificial intelligence \u2014 and a well-known skeptic of the AI hype machine \u2014 wrote on his Substack that GPT-5 makes \u201cGood progress on many fronts\u201d but disappoints in others. Marcus noted that even after multi-billion-dollar investments, \u201cGPT-5 is not the huge leap forward people long expected.\u201d\nThe last time OpenAI released a frontier model was over two years ago with GPT-4. Since then, several competitors like Google Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, Meta's Llama, and DeepSeek R1 have caught up to OpenAI on benchmarks, similar agentic features, and user loyalty. For many, GPT-5 had the power to reinforce or topple OpenAI's reign as the AI leader.\nWith this in mind, it's inevitable that some users would be disappointed, and many ChatGPT users have shared positive reviews of GPT-5 as well. Time may blunt these criticisms as OpenAI makes improvements and tweaks to GPT-5. The company has also historically been responsive to user feedback, with Altman being very active on X.\n\"We currently believe the best way to successfully navigate AI deployment challenges is with a tight feedback loop of rapid learning and careful iteration,\" the company's mission statement avows.\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable\u2019s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\nUPDATE: Aug. 8, 2025, 3:20 p.m. EDT This story has been updated with Sam Altman's responses from the Reddit AMA.\nCecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.

      "text": "OpenAI has launched GPT-5, a new flagship AI model that will power the company\u2019s next generation of ChatGPT.\nGPT-5, which was released Thursday, is OpenAI\u2019s first \u201cunified\u201d AI model and combines the reasoning abilities of its o-series of models with the fast responses of its GPT series. The next-generation model signals a new era for ChatGPT \u2014 and its creator, OpenAI \u2014 pointing to OpenAI\u2019s broader ambitions to develop AI systems that are more like agents than chatbots.\nWhile GPT-4 enabled AI chatbots to offer smart responses on a wide variety of questions, GPT-5 allows ChatGPT to complete a wide variety of tasks on behalf of users \u2014 such as generating software applications, navigating a user\u2019s calendar, or creating research briefs.\nWith GPT-5, OpenAI has also sought to make ChatGPT simpler to use. Instead of asking users to choose the right settings, GPT-5 comes equipped with a real-time router that decides how to offer the best answer, whether that\u2019s responding to user questions quickly or taking additional time to \u201cthink\u201d through answers.\nDuring a briefing with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed GPT-5 is \u201cthe best model in the world,\u201d and said it represented a \u201csignificant step\u201d along the company\u2019s path to developing AI that can outperform humans at most economically valuable work \u2014 that is, artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\u201cHaving something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable at any previous time in history,\u201d said Altman.\nStarting Thursday, GPT-5 will be available to all free users of ChatGPT as their default model. OpenAI\u2019s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, said this is part of the company\u2019s effort to give free users access to an AI reasoning model for the first time. (Previously, the company gated these more advanced models behind a paywall.)\n\u201cThis is just one of the ways that I\u2019m excited to live the mission, making sure that this stuff actually benefits people,\u201d said Turley on the decision, referencing OpenAI\u2019s long-standing mission to distribute advanced AI to as many people as possible.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThe expectations are high for GPT-5, one of OpenAI\u2019s most anticipated product launches since ChatGPT put the company on the map in 2022. Since then, ChatGPT has grown into one of the world\u2019s most popular consumer products, reaching more than 700 million users every week \u2014 nearly 10% of the globe\u2019s population, according to the company.\nMany see GPT-5 as a bellwether for AI progress broadly, and the model\u2019s reception by Silicon Valley could have profound implications for Big Tech, Wall Street, and policymakers regulating technology. These stakeholders are watching to see if GPT-5 offers a significant jump in AI\u2019s capabilities, much like its predecessor, GPT-4, which challenged expectations of what software can do.\nGPT-5 offers a slight edge on the competition\nOpenAI claims GPT-5 is state-of-the-art in several domains, slightly edging out leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI on key benchmarks. However, GPT-5 slightly underperforms frontier AI models in other areas.\nThe company says GPT-5 offers frontier-level performance around coding; Altman said the model specifically excels at spinning up entire software applications on demand, in what\u2019s become known as \u201cvibe coding.\u201d\nOn SWE-bench Verified \u2014 a test of real-world coding tasks pulled from GitHub \u2014 GPT-5 scores 74.9% on its first attempt. That means GPT-5 just outperforms Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude Opus 4.1 model, which scored 74.5%, and Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 59.6%.\nOn Humanity\u2019s Last Exam \u2014 a difficult test measuring AI model performance across math, humanities, and the natural sciences \u2014 a version of GPT-5 with extended reasoning (GPT-5 Pro) scored 42% when using tools. That\u2019s slightly less than xAI was able to achieve with Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 44.4% on the test.\nOn GPQA Diamond \u2014 a test of PhD-level science questions \u2014 GPT-5 pro scored 89.4% on its first try, outperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 80.9%, and Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 88.9%.\nOpenAI says GPT-5 is better for answering health-related questions. On a test measuring accuracy in AI model responses around healthcare topics, HealthBench Hard Hallucinations, OpenAI says GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates just 1.6% of the time. This is far lower than the company\u2019s previous GPT-4o and o3 models, which scored 12.9% and 15.8, respectively.\nWhile AI chatbots are not medical professionals, millions of people are using them for health advice. In response to this phenomenon, the company says GPT-5 is more proactive about flagging potential health concerns and helping users parse medical results.\nIn addition, OpenAI says GPT-5 is better than other AI models on more difficult-to-measure, subjective domains, such as creative design and writing. Turley said GPT-5 responds more naturally and exhibits \u201cbetter taste\u201d than other AI models on creative tasks.\n\u201cThe vibes of this model are really good,\u201d said Turley.\nGPT-5 is also more accurate than OpenAI\u2019s previous models, and the company says it suffers far less from hallucinations \u2014 the tendency for AI models to make up information \u2014 compared to its o-series models. Hallucinations seemed to be getting worse in OpenAI\u2019s latest AI reasoning models, such as o3, and OpenAI previously said it didn\u2019t quite understand why it was happening.\nIn responses to ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI found that GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates and responds with incorrect information 4.8% of the time. That\u2019s a significant reduction from o3 and GPT-4o, which score hallucination rates of 22% and 20.6%, respectively, on the test.\nOn a benchmark measuring an AI model\u2019s agentic ability to complete simulated online tasks, Tau-bench, GPT-5 offers mixed performance. On part of the test measuring an AI\u2019s ability to navigate an airline\u2019s website, GPT-5 scores 63.5%, slightly underperforming o3, which scored 64.8%. On another part of the test measuring AI\u2019s ability to navigate retail websites, GPT-5 scores 81.1%, underperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 82.4%.\nOpenAI also says that GPT-5 is safer than its previous models. While AI reasoning models occasionally exhibit a tendency to scheme against humans or lie to promote their own goals, OpenAI found that GPT-5 was deceptive at a lower rate than other models.\nAlex Beutel, OpenAI\u2019s safety research lead, said reducing deception improves not only the safety of GPT-5, but also the user experience, creating a model that\u2019s more \u201ctransparent and honest in ways users can trust.\u201d\nBeutel also notes GPT-5 is better at discerning between bad actors who are trying to misuse ChatGPT and users making harmless requests. This results in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information.\nUpgrades for consumers and developers\nChatGPT is getting a few user experience upgrades as part of the GPT-5 launch. Users can now select from four new personalities in ChatGPT\u2019s setting: Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd. The company says these will adapt ChatGPT\u2019s responses without requiring users to specifically ask the model to respond in a certain way.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT\u2019s $20-per-month Plus plan get higher usage limits for GPT-5 than free users. Meanwhile, $200-per-month Pro subscribers will have unlimited access to GPT-5, as well as a souped-up version called GPT-5 Pro that uses additional computational resources to produce better answers. Organizations on OpenAI\u2019s Team, Edu, and Enterprise plans will gain access to GPT-5 as their default model next week.\nFor developers, GPT-5 is coming to OpenAI\u2019s API in three sizes \u2014 gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano \u2014 which will spend more or less time \u201creasoning\u201d through tasks. Developers can also now control verbosity in the OpenAI API, deciding how long or short an AI model\u2019s responses should be.\nThe base model of GPT-5 will cost developers $1.25 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the entire \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series) and $10 per million output tokens.\nThe launch of GPT-5 comes after a busy week for OpenAI. The company released an open-weight reasoning model, gpt-oss, that developers and enterprises can download for free and run at a fraction of the cost. The open model nearly matched the abilities of OpenAI\u2019s previous top models, o3 and o4-mini, but GPT-5 sets a new standard for frontier performance in some areas, such as coding.\nHowever, GPT-5 seems to be roughly on par with other frontier AI models in several areas. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story for any AI model, and it remains to be seen how developers will use GPT-5 in the real world, and whether the model is truly a step above the competition."

  "argos_summary": "OpenAI's recent launch of GPT-5 aimed to simplify the ChatGPT experience by introducing a unified AI model that would automatically select the best response method for users. However, the rollout has faced criticism, with users expressing disappointment over the model's perceived lack of personality and the reintroduction of a complex model picker. Despite claims of improved performance in various tasks, including coding and health-related queries, many users feel that GPT-5 does not meet the high expectations set by its predecessor, GPT-4, leading to a backlash and calls for the return of older models.",
