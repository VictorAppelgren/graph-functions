  "title": "You Can Now Ask Google Photos to Edit Your Images",
  "description": "It was announced today at the Made by Google event that Google Photos is getting voice-based AI photo editing.",
  "content": "The Google Pixel 10 series may have been the highlight of today's Made by Google event, but as with all things Google in recent times, AI-related progress is also worth highlighting. This time, Google Photos is getting a fun new feature: You'll be able to use your voice to edit photos in the app. The feature is coming first to the Pixel 10 in the U.S., the company announced at the event.\n\nGoogle claims this feature works in real time and you'll be able to immediately see the changes appear after you ask Google Photos to make edits. This sounds like it'll make it easier to edit photos for people who aren't skilled at doing it themselves\u2014you can simply ask the app to create the desired effect and it'll handle the rest, Google says.\n\nThe examples Google shares include queries like \"restore this old photo\" or \"remove the cars in the background,\" both of which, if they work as expected, are a lot easier to do via AI. For people who don't know what kind of edits they want, Google says simpler voice commands like \"make it better\" will also work. It also supports contextual follow-ups for you to make further tweaks to the image using voice commands.\n\nDuring the Pixel 10 launch event, Google did show a live demo of how voice-prompted editing works. The host of the Call Her Daddy podcast, Alex Cooper, took a photo with Jimmy Fallon (of The Tonight Show fame), and asked Google Photos to fix the lighting and the frame. The photo featured Cooper and Fallon, but a bright spotlight had messed up its lighting and the frame was also asymmetrical. In the demo, Gemini was able to turn their picture into a well-lit photo and it cropped rotated the picture slightly to fix the frame as well.\n\nHowever, that does raise important ethical questions around the nature of photographs if Gemini generates things that weren't in the original image or gets the colors wrong in an edit. Google has addressed this to some extent by adding support for C2PA Content Credentials in Google Photos, which lets you view how the image was created and edited, and if AI was used in the process, as shown here:\n\nPixel 10 is implementing this C2PA Content Credentials standard in its native camera app. This feature will slowly roll out to other Android devices and Google Photos for iOS in the coming weeks.",

      "text": "With the recent release of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 7, the standard for folding phones is thinner than ever before. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a bit odd that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold looks so similar to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. But while this year\u2019s model looks like a fairly incremental upgrade on the surface, dig a little deeper, and you\u2019ll notice that most of the phone\u2019s specs have been overhauled.\nSome things have stayed the same\nI\u2019ll start off with what hasn\u2019t been changed, since there\u2019s not that much to go through. Maybe the most disappointing thing about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is that it\u2019s got the same size and weight as its predecessor. That means it\u2019s 6.1 inches tall and 3.0 inches wide, as well as 0.4 inches thick when closed and 0.2 inches thick when unfolded. While not excessively hefty, especially with the weight only coming up to 0.57 pounds, it\u2019s still much bulkier than Samsung\u2019s option, which set a new standard when it released late last month. If you want the absolute thinnest folding phone around, this won\u2019t be it.\nInternally, the memory is also the same as on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, at 16GB of RAM. Additionally, while Google told me that the 48MP main camera on the rear of the phone is \u201cnew,\u201d the specs sheet seems to match the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera setup, with a 48MP main camera, a 10.5MP ultrawide camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera. I\u2019ve reached out to Google for additional details about that discrepancy and will update this post once I hear back.\nAnd that\u2019s about it as far as specs that haven\u2019t been improved in some way. Inside and out, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is almost entirely new. Here\u2019s what\u2019s worth paying attention to.\nA new chip and more storage options\nLike the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is upgrading to Google\u2019s first fully custom chip, the Tensor G5. Google\u2019s in-house chips specialize in power efficiency and AI, but have historically lacked in power elsewhere. With the G5, Google has an opportunity to correct that oversight, and while I haven\u2019t been able to test drive it yet, the company says the new chip is 60% more efficient on AI and has a 34% faster CPU overall.\nThat kind of power bump could make downloading heavyweight apps like games a lot more worthwhile, which is why it\u2019s good that there\u2019s now a 1TB storage option as well, in addition to the previously available 256GB and 512GB options.\nBigger, brighter, and more durable screens\nMaybe the biggest upgrades this time around are to the foldable\u2019s all-important screens. While the phone\u2019s main, internal screen seems the same on the surface, there are improvements both inside and out.\nStarting off with pure numbers, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold\u2019s cover screen, which you\u2019ll use while the phone is folded, is now a little bigger at 6.4 inches as opposed to 6.3 inches on the last model. The aspect ratio is still 20:9, meaning it won\u2019t quite match the wider, 21:9 field of view on non-folding phones, but thinner bezels are always appreciated. It\u2019s also brighter now, at up to 3,000 nits peak brightness compared to 2,700 nits on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, although the refresh rate still caps out at 120Hz.\nThe internal screen, or the main screen that you\u2019ll use when unfolding the phone, is mostly the same, still coming in at 8 inches with the same 120Hz refresh rate. Looking just at the numbers, the only noticeable difference is that the peak brightness is also now 3,000 nits, as opposed to 2,700 nits on last year\u2019s model.\nNumbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, though. Foldable screens can be notoriously finicky, and Google says it\u2019s re-engineered the Pixel 10 Pro Fold\u2019s internal screen to be more durable, with \u201cultra-thin glass and two-layers of anti-impact film.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean a lot to me, but what does is that Google\u2019s promising the phone will be able to hold up to over 10 years of folding, which is a massive improvement over the issues the first Pixel Fold famously had. Google\u2019s even managed to get an IP68 dust and water resistance rating for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, something Samsung couldn\u2019t do with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Dust can wreak havoc on folding phone screens if they get stuck in between them when they\u2019re closed, so some promised resistance to it should go a long way towards peace of mind.\nHigher battery life\nAs on the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, Google\u2019s promising increased battery life on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, up from a promised 24-ish hours to around 30ish hours. Those kind of promises depend on how you use your phone, so stay tuned for a more concrete test once I\u2019ve gotten some more time with the device. What I can say for now is that the battery capacity itself is at least bigger, at a typical 5,015 mAh vs. 4,650 mAh on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Fast charging is also promised to be able to hit up to 50% in about 30 minutes over a 30W wireless charger, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold needed a 45W charger.\nPixelsnap\nMaybe my favorite addition to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is Google\u2019s version of MagSafe, called Pixelsnap. Also being introduced on the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, Pixelsnap uses Qi2 charging and allows compatible chargers to magnetically snap right onto your device, to wireless charge at speeds of up to 25W, no adhesive magnetic rings required.\nGoogle says it\u2019s working with a number of partners for Pixelsnap compatible accessories, but for now, it\u2019s also releasing three of its own. There\u2019s the Pixelsnap Charger, a small puck that lays flat, the Pixelsnap Charger with Stand, which is the same thing but with a vertical stand you can slide the puck into, and the Pixelsnap Ring Stand. The Ring Stand is unique in that it doesn\u2019t charge your phone, but does hold it up for you, in either portrait or landscape mode.\nAll Pixel cases this year are also Pixelsnap compatible.\nSoftware improvements\nWhile most of Google\u2019s software improvements this year are focused on AI, which works generally across its phones, there are also a couple of tweaks that make the Pixel 10 Pro Fold specifically a bit more usable.\nFor instance, split-screen mode now lets you adjust an app\u2019s size, in addition to allowing you to drag and drop files or photos across open apps.\nCompatible apps\u2014mostly games like Asphalt Legends and Disney Speedstorm\u2014also continue to offer dual-screen modes, which display the gameplay on one half of the screen and the racetrack\u2019s map on the other half. Google says it is working with more developers to increase the amount of apps that work with this feature.\nBut what\u2019s possibly the most useful is Instant View, which allows you to preview photos in full right after taking them. It works while your phone is unfolded, and displays the normal camera app UI on one half of the screen, and the previewed photo on the other half.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold pricing and availability\nGood news: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn\u2019t cost anything more than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, starting at $1,799 across both available colors. Those include gray (moonstone) and lime green (Jade). Pre-orders are available now, but unlike the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, the Pro Fold won\u2019t hit shelves until Oct. 9. You can pre-order from Amazon, Best Buy, and Google directly.\nAll in all, the 10 Pro Fold is shaping up to be an impressive update on the 9 Pro Fold, assuming you don\u2019t want the thinnest foldable on the market. It\u2019s certainly boasting higher durability than most of the competitors, so stay tuned for my full review to see how that pans out, as well as how the new Tensor G5 chip holds up to benchmarking."

      "text": "Google\u2019s latest Pixel phones are here, and along with them, a bunch of new AI features. While I'll talk more about those once I've gotten some hands-on time with them, how\u2019s the hardware itself? Well, this year\u2019s models look a lot like last year\u2019s on the outside, but on the inside, this is one of Google\u2019s biggest upgrade cycles in a while. There\u2019s a new camera lens, an upgraded chip, and even a MagSafe-like charging mechanism, so you can rest easy knowing that Google isn\u2019t just doing the bare minimum this year.\nWhether you\u2019re after a Pro phone or just want to stick with the base model, here are all the Pixel 10 specs you need to know before you buy. I\u2019ve even gotten some hands-on time with these phones, and while I can share firsthand photos, I haven\u2019t been able to play with the software much yet. Still, there\u2019s plenty to go over, so I\u2019ll be sticking to non-folding phones for this breakdown. Click here for a similar look at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nWhat has stayed the same?\nTo the naked eye, there\u2019s a lot about the Pixel 10 line that\u2019s similar to the Pixel 9, but that\u2019s not always a bad thing. The Pixel 10 is roughly the same size and weight as the Pixel 9, give or take a few ounces on specific models, and the controversial but iconic camera bar is still here. The screen is still OLED and is also the same size and resolution as the Pixel 9 line (with differences depending on your model), but most notably, the Pro version still comes in two sizes.\nWhile all of Google\u2019s Pro phones used to be on the larger side, last year\u2019s Pixel 9 finally saw the company release both a regular Pro phone and a Pro XL model. The Pro XL was the same size as prior Pro-level Pixels, but the regular Pro version was the same size as the non-Pro model. It was a great change for people like me who want a powerful phone but are willing to give up some screen space to get a more compact design, and I\u2019m happy to see it return.\nAs for the Pixel 10\u2019s internals, the standard version still comes with 12GB of RAM while the Pro model has 16GB of RAM. And that\u2019s it for the major similarities. Here\u2019s a quick specs list, to break it down.\nPixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro Dimensions: 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches\nPixel 10 Pro XL Dimensions: 6.4 x 3 x 0.3 inches\nPixel 10 Resolution: 1080 x 2424 @ 120Hz\nPixel 10 Pro Resolution: 1280 x 2856 @ 120Hz\nPixel 10 Pro XL Resolution: 1344 x 2992 @120Hz\nPixel 10 Memory: 12GB RAM\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL Memory: 16GB RAM\nWhat\u2019s new?\nYou might have noticed I have yet to talk about the camera, the processor, and even basics like storage or battery yet. Yep, those all have changes this time around, though in one case, it\u2019s not strictly an upgrade.\nProbably the biggest change is to the camera. While the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have roughly identical spec sheets to the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL, minus slightly larger apertures, the base Pixel 10 has gotten a major shake up.\nIf you look closely at the standard Pixel 10\u2019s camera bar, you might notice that there\u2019s a third lens here. Yep, this year\u2019s model adds a telephoto camera to the Pixel 10, giving you an up to 5x optical zoom and 20x \u201cSuper Res Zoom,\u201d which combines information from shots across various zoom levels to try to keep pixelation at bay. That said, it does come with a downside, which I\u2019ll get into a bit later on.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL do try to up their zoom capabilities as well, although that\u2019s mostly thanks to a software trick\u2014\u201cPro Res Zoom.\u201d This lets you zoom in up to 100 times and uses generative AI to fill in any gaps. While Super Res Zoom isn\u2019t a new feature overall\u2014just new to non-Pro models\u2014Pro Res Zoom still has yet to prove itself outside of Google\u2019s hands.\nOutside of the camera, the biggest change is probably to the processor. All Pixel 10 models use Google\u2019s latest chip, the Tensor G5. While I\u2019ll need some time with it to speak to its performance, Google is promising \u201cits biggest leap in performance yet,\u201d and it certainly needs it. While Google\u2019s Tensor chips tend to be strong on power efficiency and AI tasks, they often underperform when it comes to running demanding apps like games. This is Google\u2019s first fully custom chip, whereas previous iterations relied on help from Samsung. Hopefully, like with Apple\u2019s M-series chips, the move to fully in-house design comes with higher performance. The company is promising up to 60% more efficiency in AI tasks and a 34% faster CPU.\nAs for battery life, that\u2019s supposedly improved across the board. Google is promising 30+ hour battery life across all models of the Pixel 10, up from the 24+ hour battery life the company promised on the Pixel 9. Specific battery capacity depends on the model, but either way, that\u2019s some impressive longevity if it pans out.\nFinally, storage and color options. Storage options for the base Pixel 10 and the Pixel 10 Pro are the same as on the Pixel 9, but the Pro XL now starts with at least 256GB of storage, axing the previous 128GB model (I\u2019ll get into this more when I talk about price). As for color, Google likes to swap out color options with each new release. The Pixel 10 comes in black (obsidian), a light violet (frost), blue (indigo), and yellow (lemon), while the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL come in black (obsidian), gray (moonstone), tan (porcelain), and light green (jade).\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of all the new specs, before I get into a brand new hardware feature.\nPixel 10 Rear Camera: 48 MP Wide lens/13 MP Ultrawide lens/10.8 MP Telephoto lens\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL Rear Camera: 50 MP Wide lens/ 48 MP Ultrawide lens/48 MP Telephoto lens\nPixel 10 Selfie Camera: 10.5MP\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL Selfie Camera: 42 MP\nPixel 10 Battery: Typical 4970 mAh, Minimum 4825 mAh\nPixel 10 Pro Battery: Typical 4870 mAh, Minimum 4707 mAh\nPixel 10 Pro XL Battery: Typical 5200 mAh, Minimum 5079 mAh\nPixel 10 Storage: Available in 128GB or 256GB\nPixel 10 Pro Storage: Available in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB\nPixel 10 Pro XL Storage: Available in 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB\nWhat is Pixelsnap?\nMaybe the most exciting upgrade to the Pixel 10 line, though, is hard to break down with specs. Instead, this is an entirely new hardware feature called Pixelsnap\u2014it\u2019s essentially Google\u2019s answer to MagSafe.\nUsing Qi2 charging, Pixelsnap allows compatible chargers to magnetically attach right onto your phone and wirelessly charge your device at speeds of up to 25W. No more fiddling with adhesive rings, thank goodness.\nGoogle says it\u2019s partnering with a bunch of manufacturers for Pixelsnap compatible accessories, but for now, it\u2019s also releasing three of its own. There\u2019s the Pixelsnap Charger, a simple puck that you just place your phone on, the Pixelsnap Charger with Stand, which charges your phone while letting you dock it in either portrait or landscape mode, and the Pixelsnap Ring Stand, which doesn\u2019t charge your phone but can hold it up in either portrait or landscape mode. Conveniently, the Pixelsnap Charger with Stand is also modular, so you can remove the charging puck and lay it flat if you'd like, essentially turning it into a basic Pixelsnap Charger.\nAll Pixel cases this year are also Pixelsnap compatible.\nAn upgraded camera, but at a cost\nIf you were paying attention earlier, you might have noticed one downgrade on the base Pixel 10. Yep, in exchange for the telephoto lens, the ultrawide lens now has much fewer megapixels, down from 48 to 13. Whether or not this will impact you depends on how you use your phone. Do you zoom in a lot? Then this is an upgrade. Do you ever use the 0.5x button to zoom out? Then you\u2019re giving up some fidelity there.\nThat said, there is a catch. While the Pixel 9 has a higher fidelity ultrawide camera than the Pixel 10, it still compresses all its photos down to 12.5MP by default. You can get around this by capturing RAW photos, but then you\u2019ll lose out on Pixel\u2019s postprocessing. Google also says it's improved some of the camera's software to make up for the loss in megapixels.\nThis means that most users probably won\u2019t see much of a difference, but a photo compressed down from 48MP is still going to have more detail to work with than one shot at 13MP. It\u2019s worth keeping in mind if you use that 0.5x button a lot, so if you\u2019re concerned, click here for a more detailed breakdown.\nHow much does the Pixel 10 cost?\nAnd here\u2019s the part you\u2019ve probably all been waiting for: How much is all of this going to cost you?\nLuckily, for most models, pricing remains the exact same as on the Pixel 9. The Pixel 10 starts at $799 and the Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the odd one out.\nBecause the 128GB model is gone, the Pixel 10 Pro XL starts at $1,199, which is $100 more than last year. It\u2019s a bummer, but at least a 256GB model here doesn\u2019t cost more than a 256GB model of the Pixel 9 Pro XL. You just have fewer options to pick from.\nAs for accessories, the Pixelsnap Charger starts at $55, the Pixelsnap Charger with Stand starts at $99, the PixelSnap Ring Stand starts at $49, and Pixelsnap cases start at $69.\nThe Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL are available for pre-order now and will start shipping on August 28."

This year, that means the Pixel 10 line (Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel Pro Fold), Pixel Watch 4, and potentially Pixel Buds 2a. It should be a fun show.\nGoogle has already teased all of the phones in the Pixel 10 line across videos on its YouTube channel, so we know they're coming for sure. But Google still has a chance to surprise us with these devices' hardware specs. While they haven't officially announced the next generation of Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds, rumors strongly suggest these devices are coming, too. It only makes sense: Google typically introduces a full line of products at Made by Google, and I imagine this year would be no different.\nThe show starts Aug. 20 at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET). Unlike many other tech companies, Google still holds live stage announcements, and this year, Made by Google is taking place in NYC. We'll be covering the event live as it happens, updating the live blog with each new announcement Google makes from the stage.

You can also simply tap or circle parts of an image right when you open the editor and get suggestions for editing that specific area, like erasing a distraction.\nToday, we\u2019re introducing conversational editing capabilities in the redesigned photo editor, so you\u2019ll have more ways to make stunning edits, including simple gestures, one-tap suggestions and now, natural language. Thanks to advanced Gemini capabilities, Photos can now help you make custom AI-powered edits that bring your vision to life in just seconds. No need to select tools or adjust sliders. All you have to do is ask Photos for the edits you want to see.\nBecause this is an open-ended, conversational experience, you don\u2019t have to indicate which tools you want to use. For example, you could ask for a specific edit, like \u201cremove the cars in the background\u201d or something more general like \u201crestore this old photo\u201d and Photos will understand the changes you\u2019re trying to make. You can even make multiple requests in a single prompt like \u201cremove the reflections and fix the washed out colors.\u201d And if you truly have no idea where to start, you can just start by typing or saying, \u201cmake it better\u201d or using one of the provided suggestions. Then if you want to make tweaks, you can add follow-up instructions after each edit to fine-tune your image and get it looking just right.\nBeyond corrective edits like lighting and removing distractions, you can ask for more creative help. For example, you could change the background of your image, add fun items like a party hat or sunglasses to the main subject and so much more. Without having to worry about choosing which tools to use and how they\u2019ll work together, the possibilities are wide open when it comes to editing \u2014 all you have to do is tell Photos what you want to see, from simple tweaks to complex edits.\nSee how your images were made for added transparency\nPixel 10 devices will be the first to implement industry-standard C2PA Content Credentials within the native camera app, across photos created by Pixel Camera, with and without AI. To further improve transparency around how images are made, we\u2019re adding support for C2PA Content Credentials in Google Photos \u2014 in addition to the existing support for IPTC metadata for AI-edited images and SynthID for images edited with Reimagine.\nAvailable first for Pixel 10 \u2014 and rolling out gradually on Android and iOS devices over the coming weeks \u2014 you\u2019ll now be able to see information right in Google Photos indicating how an image was captured or edited based on C2PA Content Credentials.\nGemini models support so many creative and useful features in Google Photos \u2014 from search to editing. We\u2019ll continue to explore how to continue to use them to bring you new, helpful ways to use the app."
