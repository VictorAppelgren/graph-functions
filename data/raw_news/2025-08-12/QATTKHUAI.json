  "title": "22 Korean Beauty Products Under $15 That\u2019ll Earn A Permanent Place In Your Routine",
  "description": "Including a hydrating lippie that reviewers are comparing to Tarte's Juicy Maracuja and YSL's Candy Glaze... (*adds to cart*)",
  "content": "A waterproof mascara reviewers have hailed as a holy grail if you have short, straight eyelashes that don't seem to hold a curl. The slender, curved wand makes sure that even those sneaky, barely-there lashes get the attention they deserve \u2014 and if you already have some length to work with, this mascara gives you that extra oomph. And! If you need a good mascara remover (that's also under $15), here's one from the same brand. Promising review: \"10 stars if I could! This is the only mascara that I've ever used that has actually been able to maintain a curl for my lashes. I'm blessed with long thick lashes, but sadly they point straight at the ground. Most mascaras that I\u2019ve tried can\u2019t seem to hold any of the curl from my lash curler, leaving me with dark smears under my eyes and droopy lashes not long after application. With this mascara\u2026 absolutely flawless. No transferring at all. Just wore it for the first time on a 8 hour flight and my lashes looked the exact same after a long nap under an eyemask as they did when I first applied. Seriously, this stuff works.\" \u2014Samantha Anne\n\n Get it from Amazon for $14.07+ (available in five styles).\n\n\n\n A buildable Missha tinted BB cream that's a primer, foundation, concealer, AND sunscreen (with SPF 42 and PA+++)! It also offers some seriously hydrating skincare magic thanks to the hyaluronic acid and ceramides. If you're someone who wants to skip out on having a million different bottles on your vanity and simplify your beauty routine, this is THE one-and-done face product. In case you're not familiar with it, PA stands for \"Protection Grade of UVA\" and is a four-level rating system that's more common in Asia. In this case, PA+++ just means this product offers a high level of protection against UVA rays, which don't cause sunburn but rather cause the skin to turn brown. Promising review: \"I've been using Missha BB cream for eight years now, and it's hands-down the best BB cream I've ever tried! What I love most is how lightweight it feels on my skin while still providing natural coverage that hides my redness and occasional blemishes without looking cakey. The staying power is impressive \u2014 I can apply it in the morning, and it still looks fresh by the end of my workday without needing touch-ups. After eight years of loyalty to this product, I can confidently say it's worth every penny!\" \u2014Daryna Get it from Amazon for $12.90 (available in seven shades). The shade range is unfortunately pretty limited for this product \u2014 if you're looking for another option in this price range, check out E.l.f's Camo CC Cream!",

If you\u2019ve broken the rules (and gone against dermatologists\u2019 advice) by taking matters into your own hands, you may be left with the gory aftermath: An open wound leaking pus, oil and even blood.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nEnter pimple patches, sometimes known as zit stickers, which may be able to help soothe your skin in a pinch. Dermatologist Amy Kassouf, MD, explains what these over-the-counter spot treatments can \u2014 and can\u2019t \u2014 do for your skin troubles.\nPimple patches are small stickers made with a slightly gummy wound-healing gel called hydrocolloid. Larger versions are marketed as \u201cblister bandages,\u201d but they\u2019re all designed to do the same thing: Help your skin heal faster.\n\u201cPimple patches work by absorbing any drainage from the pimple and covering the wound to prevent further trauma to the site, such as picking,\u201d Dr. Kassouf explains. \u201cThey work best on open, draining, healing pustules, papules and cysts.\u201d\nOf course, you know you\u2019re not supposed to pick at your skin or pop zits. But if you\u2019ve already committed this skin care sin, a pimple patch may be a helpful healer.\nMost pimple patches need to be worn for a few hours in order to do their thing, so you may want to plan to apply yours before bed. Some versions are also designed to be inconspicuous enough to be worn during the day.\nBefore applying your pimple patch, make sure your skin is completely dry, as the patches won\u2019t stick as well to wet skin. If your freshly picked pimple is leaking or oozing, be sure to cleanse the spot before application.\nAdvertisement\nSimply apply the pimple patch over your zit \u2014 remember, they only work on open wounds \u2014 and leave it on for the recommended amount of time (which varies by product). When you peel it off, your blemish may be smaller and less inflamed.\nFor most people, pimple patches are, at worst, simply unhelpful \u2014 which is to say that they won\u2019t make your acne worse, but they won\u2019t make it better, either. If you have sensitive skin, though, you may want to steer clear of pimple patches.\n\u201cThey do use a bit of adhesive to stick to your skin, so if you\u2019re allergic or sensitive to adhesive, this may aggravate the skin surrounding the lesion,\u201d Dr. Kassouf says.\nAnd some brands use ingredients such as salicylic acid or tea tree oil to dry out pimples, which may also dry or irritate sensitive skin.\nThough pimple patches can be very effective on existing lesions, they have significant limitations.\n\u201cPimple patches don\u2019t work at all on closed lesions or deeper lesions or even blackheads and whiteheads, which are called comedones,\u201d Dr. Kassouf explains. \u201cThey are spot treatments for active bumps and have no ability to prevent acne from coming,\u201d nor can they clear clogged pores or other precursors to acne flares.\u201d\nIn other words, if you\u2019re struggling with cystic acne, large-scale breakouts or other skin concerns, pimple patches aren\u2019t going to do the trick.\nThere\u2019s no real harm in using zit stickers \u2014 but they may not work, either, leaving you pimply and frustrated. \u201cThey\u2019re really just wound healing dressings for a very specific type of lesion,\u201d Dr. Kassouf says. \u201cThey can be helpful, but for overall acne treatment, there is little use for them.\nDon\u2019t fret, though. You\u2019ve got options.\n\u201cThere are a lot of great over-the-counter medications these days that do more for the money,\u201d Dr. Kassouf says.\nAdvertisement\nIf your breakouts are related to an underlying issue like a hormonal imbalance, these treatments may not be enough for you. \u201cIf hormones are the issue, your dermatologist may have much better options for you,\u201d Dr. Kassouf says.\nBottom line? Pimple patches can be a worthwhile option for certain, minor skin troubles, but don\u2019t expect them to be a cure-all for your skin ailments.\nAdvertisement\nLearn more about our editorial process.\nAdvertisement\nUsing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide can help clear up breakouts near your lips\nBenzoyl peroxide spot treatments are the gold standard, but they\u2019re not the only game in town\nPopping these pimples is not an option\nIt can actually make your blemish worse, not better\nClean hands and gentle pressure are critical \u2014 but it\u2019s better to leave those zits alone\nSoften your skin with warm water and shaving cream before shaving with the grain of the hair\nAge is the most likely reason for typical graying, but premature graying may be caused by stress, diet, smoking or autoimmune disease\nThe convenient option is good for touch-ups, but it shouldn\u2019t replace your traditional sunscreen\nIf you\u2019re feeling short of breath, sleep can be tough \u2014 propping yourself up or sleeping on your side may help\nIf you fear the unknown or find yourself needing reassurance often, you may identify with this attachment style\nIf you\u2019re looking to boost your gut health, it\u2019s better to get fiber from whole foods"
