  "content": "Borussia Dortmund are interested in signing Chelsea defender Aaron Anselmino on loan.\n\nThe Athletic reported in the Transfer DealSheet that Anselmino had offers from Champions League and Europa League clubs outside the United Kingdom but will not go to Strasbourg, Chelsea\u2019s sister club.\n\nChelsea head coach Enzo Maresca confirmed that a loan move for Anselmino was being planned when asked by The Athletic at a press conference on Thursday. The club are prepared to let the 20-year-old go despite the anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered by Levi Colwill that will rule him out for several months.\n\n\u201cHe is a good player but he needs to play games, he needs to go (on loan) and he is another player that is waiting for a solution, said Maresca.\u201d\n\nAnselmino joined the London club from Boca Juniors in August 2024 for a fee in the region of \u00a317million. He went immediately back on loan to his boyhood club but was recalled by Chelsea in January.\n\nThe Argentinean defender was training with the first team and remained with the side until the end of the season but only played twice, once with the Under-21 side and once as a substitute during the Club World Cup which they won.\n\nHe has had three hamstring injuries over the past two seasons which has impacted his playing time, the most significant of which came in February after his return to Stamford Bridge.\n\nAnselmino made 23 senior appearances for Boca Juniors, scoring twice and registering three assists.\n\nIf a move to Dortmund goes through, he would become the second Chelsea loanee to join the German club this year. Midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka spent the second half of the 2024-25 season on loan at Dortmund, where he made 17 appearances. His Chelsea future remains uncertain, with the club preferring a permanent sale rather than another loan switch.\n\nChelsea return to action with a visit to West Ham United on Friday, while Dortmund take on St. Pauli in their first Bundesliga game of the season on Saturday.",
