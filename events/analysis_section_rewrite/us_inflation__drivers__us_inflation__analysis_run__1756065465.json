      "feedback": "Overall, the draft has a solid two-regime scaffold and a credible set of cross‑topic drivers, but it needs a tighter causal chain, a cleaner SECTION FOCUS alignment, sharper scenario structure with explicit triggers, stricter quantitative discipline, and full sourcing discipline. Actionable edits: (1) sharpen the causal chain by spelling out end‑to‑end transmission from Regime A/B signals (Fed easing vs. higher‑for‑longer policy) to discount‑rate dynamics and risk premia, then to valuations via ACMR’s long‑run economics (cite 37UZC9X8I and 22PL3Q360) and the EV capex/unit‑economics channel; explicitly link oil/energy tariffs to inflation risk and policy expectations. (2) reformat to SECTION FOCUS with a concise top‑line, a compact cross‑topic map (macro/policy, flows/positioning, valuation/technicals), and a 2×2 or 3‑scenario grid that maps each topic to observable signals, not just narrative. (3) deepen scenario structure: add explicit triggers and thresholds for Regime A and Regime B (inflation prints, Jackson Hole guidance, wage dynamics, tariff expiry) and clear invalidation rules (surprise inflation + real‑rate spike or tariff relief reversal), plus a medium‑term timing window (6–12 months) anchored to data releases. (4) fix and tighten numbers: resolve any inconsistencies (notably oil/refinery data and 2025–26 supply/demand deltas) and keep every data point tied to its source; ensure the long‑run ACMR anchor (revenue ~$900m, ~4% gross margin) is consistently applied to valuation logic. (5) strengthen first‑principles grounding by briefly stating why credible price stability compresses real rates/risk premia and how that embedded discount rate shapes ACMR cash flows; (6) enforce citation discipline: attach the exact source IDs to every material claim and reconcile any conflicts between sources; (7) deliver a tight watch-list of decisive signals (inflation prints, Jackson Hole wording, tariff‑truce expiry data, oil/refinery indicators, ACMR long‑run economics updates) with approximate timing, and (8) pare repetition and deliver one cohesive, sub‑250‑word paragraph that maps each claim to a source.",
