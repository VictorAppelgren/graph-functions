  "title": "Huge UK steel giant collapses as Labour blamed over 'net zero dogma'",
  "description": "Ongoing wages and costs to keep the plant running will be covered by the Government until a buyer is found.",
  "content": "The operation, which has plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, will be placed into the hands of the Official Receiver and special managers from advisory firm Teneo. Ongoing wages and costs to keep the plant running will be covered by the Government until a buyer is found. However, bosses at Speciality Steel said the move to wind up the business is \u201cirrational\u201d.\n\nThe Government has taken control of the UK\u2019s third-largest steelworks in a bid to save 1,450 jobs at the site. The high court confirmed on Thursday that Speciality Steel \u2013 previously part of Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s Liberty Steel business \u2013 would face a compulsory liquidation. Conservatives have blamed the situation on high energy prices due to Labour's \"net zero dogma\".\n\nJeffrey Kabel, chief transformation officer, said: \u201cThe decision to push Speciality Steel UK into compulsory liquidation, especially when we have support from the world\u2019s largest asset manager to resume operations and facilitate creditor recovery, is irrational.\n\n\u201cThe plan that GFG (Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s parent business) presented to the court would have secured new investment in the UK steel industry, protecting jobs and establishing a sustainable operational platform under a new governance structure with independent oversight.\n\n\u201cInstead, liquidation will now impose prolonged uncertainty and significant costs on UK taxpayers for settlements and related expenses, despite the availability of a commercial solution.\u201d\n\nGFG said it will put forward a bid to retake control of the business alongside debt and equity partners and present this to the Official Receiver.\n\nA Government spokesperson said: \u201cWe know this will be a deeply worrying time for staff and their families, but we remain committed to a bright and sustainable future for steelmaking and steelmaking jobs in the UK.\n\n\u201cIt is now for the independent Official Receiver to carry out their duties as liquidator, including ensuring employees are paid, while we also make sure staff and local communities are supported.\u201d\n\nUK Steel director general Gareth Stace said: \u201cUK Steel welcomes the Government\u2019s recognition of the importance of the Liberty Speciality Steel assets and hopes that a new owner is found quickly and can inject the investment and working capital required to return production volumes to previous levels.\n\n\u201cThe low production levels of recent years have left significant holes in the domestic supply chain that have been filled by imports. We hope to see these holes quickly filled by UK-made steel.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the steelworkers\u2019 union Community said: \u201cThese are worrying developments, and we are seeking clarification on what this means for our members and their livelihoods. Jobs must be protected, and these sites \u2013 which are vital strategic assets \u2013 need to resume production as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nShadow Business Secretary Andrew Griffith blamed the situation on \u201cLabour\u2019s ruinously high energy costs driven by net zero dogma\u201d.",
