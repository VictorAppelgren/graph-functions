  "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Jose Tena hit a go-ahead, two-run single in the seventh inning, Paul DeJong homered for the third time in five games and the Washington Nationals rallied past the Philadelphia Phillies 3-2 on Thursday night.\n\nDeJong walked leading off the seventh against Jesus Luzardo (11-6). Riley Adams doubled, Daylen Lile walked and, with one out, Tena singled past the drawn-in infield against Orion Kerkering to put Washington ahead 3-2.\n\nShinnosuke Ogasawara (1-1) struck out Kyle Schwarber with a runner on to end the seventh and got his first major league win. Rookie Cole Henry worked the ninth and fanned Trea Turner with a runner on third to secure his first career save.\n\nTurner had three infield hits for the National League East-leading Phillies, who have lost three straight while scoring three runs. Philadelphia left eight men on base.\n\nLuzardo allowed three runs on four hits in six-plus innings.\n\nThe Phillies didn\u2019t arrive in Washington until early Thursday afternoon after maintenance issues necessitated a change in planes and an overnight stay in Cincinnati after Wednesday night\u2019s game.\n\nDeJong homered on the first pitch he saw from Luzardo in the fourth to tie it at 1-all.\n\nTurner singled with two outs in the fifth and scored on Schwarber\u2019s double off the wall in center.\n\nWashington starter Brad Lord allowed two runs on seven hits over six innings. Since returning to the rotation on July 22, Lord has a 2.77 ERA and Washington is 4-1 in his starts.\n\nTena hit a hard grounder the opposite way on a 3-1 fastball and got it past the diving Turner at shortstop.\n\nDeJong has hit safely in five straight, going 9 for 21 (.429) with three homers and seven RBIs.",

It was the 20th homer of the season for the All-Star slugger.\nScherzer (3-2) pitched seven-plus innings while improving to 6-2 in 12 career starts against the Cubs. He permitted one run and five hits.\nJeff Hoffman handled the ninth for his 27th save in 32 chances. Toronto improved to 40-20 at home.\nBoyd (11-6) allowed two hits in seven innings. He struck out five and walked one.\nBoyd walked Davis Schneider to begin the seventh. Ernie Clement followed with a sacrifice bunt before Guerrero lined an 0-2 pitch 402 feet to left-center.\nThe Cubs had just one hit off Scherzer before Michael Busch went deep with one out in the sixth for his 24th homer.\nPromoted from Triple-A Iowa before the game, Cubs prospect Owen Caissie made his major league debut about 30 miles east of his birthplace in Burlington, Ontario. He went 0 for 4 with a strikeout.\nKey moment\nScherzer exited after Matt Shaw\u2019s leadoff double in the eighth. Brendon Little came on and walked pinch-hitter Seiya Suzuki before both runners advanced on a wild pitch. Little departed after striking out Ian Happ and Kyle Tucker. Seranthony Dom\u00ednguez fanned Carson Kelly to end the threat.\nKey stat\nThe Blue Jays are a major league-best 24-12 in interleague play.\nUp next\nCubs: RHP Colin Rea (9-5, 4.09 ERA) is scheduled to start Friday against Pirates RHP Braxton Ashcraft (3-2, 3.19 ERA).\nBlue Jays: RHP Chris Bassitt (11-6, 4.18 ERA) is expected to start Friday against Rangers RHP Jacob deGrom (10-5, 2.86 ERA).\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB"

      "text": "NL East-leading Phillies going with a 6-man rotation when Aaron Nola returns on Sunday\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Thursday that he will utilize a six-man rotation beginning this weekend when Aaron Nola returns from the injured list.\nNola is lined up for the series finale Sunday at Washington. The 32-year-old right-hander is coming back from a right ankle sprain.\nLeft-hander Ranger Su\u00e1rez takes the mound on Monday against the Mariners. The NL East leaders also have ace right-hander Zack Wheeler, lefties Cristopher S\u00e1nchez and Jes\u00fas Luzardo, and right-hander Taijuan Walker.\nThomson said he isn\u2019t sure how long he is going to use the six-man rotation.\n\u201cOnce for sure and then we\u2019ve got some other ideas how to attack this thing as we move forward,\u201d he said.\nPhiladelphia starters lead the majors with 687 1/3 innings pitched. S\u00e1nchez is up to 150 2/3 innings, and Wheeler is at 144 2/3.\n\u201cJust getting some of these guys some extra rest cause we\u2019ve been grinding on them pretty hard all year,\u201d Thomson said before the opener of a four-game set against the Nationals. \u201cThe one downside to it is you\u2019ve got to take somebody out of your bullpen, so you\u2019re a little short there but we\u2019ll just have to figure it out.\u201d\nNola hasn\u2019t pitched in the majors since May 14. He posted a 2.19 ERA in three rehab starts with Triple-A Lehigh Valley while striking out 17 batters in 12 1/3 innings.\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB"

The Mariners (67-55) fell 1 1/2 games behind AL West-leading Houston.\nCatcher Cal Raleigh, who leads the majors with 45 home runs, was out of Seattle\u2019s starting lineup for only the fifth time this season. He walked as pinch-hitter in the ninth.\nSugano (10-5) won back-to-back starts for the first time. The 35-year-old from Japan threw 81 pitches and was pulled after the 2-hour, 18-minute delay.\nRodriguez hit reliever Rico Garcia\u2019s fourth pitch after play resumed into the bleachers in right-center, a two-run shot to bring the Mariners within 5-2.\nDietrich Enns allowed Randy Arozarena\u2019s one-out RBI grounder in the ninth, but retired Josh Naylor on one pitch to earn his first save since Sept. 20, 2021.\nThe Orioles took the lead against Logan Evans (6-5) in the fourth inning. Jordan Westburg scored on Evans\u2019 two-out wild pitch, and Ryan Mountcastle moved from first to third on the same play when Evans couldn\u2019t field catcher Mitch Garver\u2019s throw. After Daniel Johnson walked, Mountcastle scored when he and Johnson executed a double steal. Johnson came around on Jeremiah Jackson\u2019s RBI single.\nBaltimore added Gunnar Henderson\u2019s RBI double and Mountcastle\u2019s sacrifice fly in the fifth.\nEvans allowed three runs --- two earned --- in four innings and matched the shortest outing of his 15-start career.\nKey moment\nOrioles reliever Keegan Akin got Naylor to ground out to second to end the seventh, stranding two runners and preserving a 5-2 lead.\nKey stat\nSugano is 3-0 with a 2.31 ERA in his last four starts.\nUp next\nMariners RHP Luis Castillo (8-6, 3.19 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game series against the host New York Mets.
