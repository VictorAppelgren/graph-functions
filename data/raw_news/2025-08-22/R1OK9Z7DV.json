  "title": "\u2018I\u2019d rather be in the wild chasing animals than going to Hollywood parties\u2019: Taylor Kitsch on fame, flops and Friday Night Lights",
  "description": "After the notorious Hollywood flop John Carter, the actor became the movie star who wasn\u2019t. Now back on TV, he is redefining what it means to be a leading man",
  "content": "There is a moment in every actor\u2019s career when they must confront their early dreams and their present reality. For Taylor Kitsch, that reckoning has been more painful than for most. \u201cIf you start marrying yourself to these phantom outcomes that don\u2019t exist, man, you\u2019re gonna go crazy,\u201d he says.\n\nKitsch is talking from New York, thousands of miles from his home in Montana, where he has carved out a different life from his Hollywood years. \u201cI\u2019d rather be in the wild chasing animals with my camera than going to clubs or bars or Hollywood parties,\u201d he says.\n\nToday he\u2019s at a press junket for his new Prime Video series, The Terminal List: Dark Wolf, which expertly marries gun battles and spy intrigue with a neat consideration of what happens when red-blooded American males are confronted by the realities of war. Before our interview, I was excited to see the exact state of dishevelment that the wildlife-chasing actor would greet me in, but my request for him to turn on his camera is politely rebuffed and I have to make do with listening to his disembodied Canadian-cum-Texan boom.\n\nThe path seemed so clear in 2012. Kitsch was a 30-year-old Canadian hockey player turned model turned actor, blessed with the kind of looks that make casting directors reach for their phones and studio heads reach for their chequebooks. He had spent the back half of his 20s playing Tim Riggins, the brooding high-school running back and rebel heart of the critically acclaimed show Friday Night Lights. His first forays into movies were solid turns, among them Gambit in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the photojournalist Kevin Carter in The Bang Bang Club. Stardom seemed inevitable. A few years earlier he had lived in his car on futile visits to LA \u2013 now he was looking up at billboards of himself. The Guardian proclaimed him a star \u201cabout to turn supernova\u201d.\n\nThen came the big swing: John Carter, Disney\u2019s $264m bet on Kitsch becoming the next great action star. The film was based on the 1912 novel A Princess of Mars, inspiration for a number of great 20th-century space operas (not least Star Wars and Dune) and was meant to be Disney\u2019s answer to Avatar. Hopes were high but the box office gods were ungiving. John Carter quickly became a punchline due to its lackluster title and marketing campaign, which one Disney executive deemed \u201cthe worst in the history of movies\u201d. The film itself is decent, certainly better than its 52% score on Rotten Tomatoes, and Kitsch received praise for the \u201cslyness\u201d brought to the title character.\n\nStill, John Carter felt derivative. Its similarities to Avatar in particular (Earth soldier is transported to an exotic planet and begrudgingly accepted by the native population before saving the day) made it a magnet for unhelpful headlines as the early box office returns proved disappointing. It went on to flop so badly (reported loss: $200m) that its title now refers less to the film than its accompanying cautionary tale of big-budget disaster. Meanwhile, the prevailing narrative around Kitsch was that he couldn\u2019t carry a blockbuster \u2013 a suspicion compounded by his next film, Battleship, a failed attempt to turn the board game into a Transformers-style franchise that is now primarily remembered for being Rihanna\u2019s film debut.\n\nThe cruel irony is that while Kitsch\u2019s charismatic screen presence was honed on a naturalistic high-school drama, his potential big break came in that post-Avatar moment when movie studios looked to build franchises around groundbreaking special effects, without necessarily marrying them to strong characters or coherent narratives.\n\nKitsch is sanguine about his part in the John Carter debacle. \u201cThere\u2019s so many cogs in that wheel of movies, man. I\u2019m literally such a small part of it.\u201d The machine was so much bigger than any one person: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s timing, or a million cooks in the kitchen, or it just didn\u2019t hit.\u201d At the time, he took it personally, feeling the weight of a $264m production, the studio\u2019s faith, the expectations that came with being positioned as the next big star. \u201cOver time,\u201d he pauses, choosing his words carefully, \u201cyou gave it the best you could. I\u2019m proud of the way I led that shoot. You move on.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most telling aspect of Kitsch\u2019s story isn\u2019t the fall \u2013 it\u2019s what he did while he was down. Rather than chase another potential blockbuster or reinvent himself as a different kind of leading man, he disappeared into the work itself. The roles that followed show an actor no longer interested in being anyone\u2019s idea of a Hollywood heart-throb. In 2015, Kitsch played a repressed highway patrol officer in season two of True Detective, a role that laid the foundation for his subsequent TV revival, embodying wounded men in a country that\u2019s constantly redefining masculinity. He marks out his 2018 part as the cult leader David Koresh in the Paramount miniseries Waco as \u201ca big turn in my career, in the sense of preparation and understanding and not judging a character\u201d. The role of Koresh, a real-life figure responsible for alleged sexual abuse and the deaths of dozens, is certainly more complex than the parts that made Kitsch famous.\n\n\u201cMy job is to marry myself emotionally to the circumstances and these guys,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think: \u2018I hope you like Dave at this point or I hope you hate him now.\u2019 I just want to be as authentic as I can be to him and service that without judgment.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that would prove essential when Netflix\u2019s Painkiller came along in 2023, a limited series examining the opioid crisis through the lens of pharmaceutical executives, addicts and the families caught between them.\n\nFor Kitsch, the project was deeply personal. \u201cAddiction runs through my family pretty hard,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really changed my perspective in a lot of ways.\u201d His sister is in recovery, so when the opportunity arose to play an opioid-addicted salesman, he asked her to advise on the role. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her detox on the floor of my house,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cThose scenes were very close to me and I had more people reach out than any other show I\u2019ve ever done, which meant a lot to me \u2026 to share it with my sister was amazing, to be honest.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, in honour of his sister\u2019s successful journey to sobriety, he founded the nonprofit Howlers Ridge. The organisation provides support for veterans and trauma survivors and represents the kind of purpose-driven project that would have been impossible during his blockbuster years. \u201cI think I\u2019ve grown up a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my 20s, I would see people who\u2019d be like: Well, why aren\u2019t you doing more? You have the means to help people.\u201d\n\nThere is an interesting parallel between Kitsch\u2019s career and the characters he is drawn to playing. Many of them are men trying to figure out how to live with themselves, how to carry on when the world has shifted beneath their feet. The transition from movie star to television actor might seem like a step backward to some, but for Kitsch, it represented something more valuable: creative control and the chance to truly inhabit his characters and allow part of them to inhabit him.\n\nThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf represents yet another step in his journey back to mainstream attention. Despite a lukewarm critical reception for the original series \u2013 including one star from the Guardian \u2013 the show became one of Prime Video\u2019s biggest streaming hits ever, largely off the back of a charismatic turn from Chris Pratt in the lead role. Working with Pratt as both co-star and producer for this new prequel series, Kitsch found himself in the curious position of partnering with someone whose career has taken the path his own could have, had the machine worked as intended. Far from any bitterness about Pratt\u2019s fame, there\u2019s genuine enthusiasm in Kitsch\u2019s voice when discussing their collaboration. \u201cWe get along really well. I think there\u2019s a mutual respect.\u201d Faced with that level of celebrity, Kitsch thinks about the practicalities: \u201cYou often wonder where you\u2019d even be living. I bet you I wouldn\u2019t even be living in Montana.\u201d\n\nThe beauty of Kitsch\u2019s current life \u2013 photographing wildlife in Montana between carefully chosen projects \u2013 is how little it resembles what anyone expected his career to look like. The actor\u2019s career is quieter but perhaps more sustainable. He\u2019s not the action star Hollywood tried to make him, but he\u2019s also not the cautionary tale they might have written him off as. Instead, he\u2019s something more interesting: an actor who faced failure, and subsequently redefined success on his own terms.\n\n\u201cI just want to keep disappearing,\u201d he says, almost as a throwaway. Not from the world, but into roles. Into people he hasn\u2019t met yet, lives he hasn\u2019t lived. Looking at Kitsch\u2019s career now, it\u2019s hard not to think that maybe the supernova metaphor was wrong from the beginning. Supernovae burn bright and burn out. What Kitsch has built instead is more like a campfire: sustainable, warm and capable of lasting through the night.\n\nThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf is on Prime Video from 27 August.",

      "text": "\"Oh fuck off!\" The words are out of my mouth before I have a chance to think about the ramifications of saying them to a Hollywood actor, especially one whose star is about to turn supernova. As soon as I do, I think I might throw up. And then, after the briefest of pauses, Taylor Kitsch's perfect eyes wrinkle up and his perfect mouth emits a perfect laugh, all manly and throaty and sounding of a thousand cigarettes.\nThe incident occurs just after Kitsch has finished telling me about the house he's building by a lake in Austin, Texas, and the boat, which he sails upon said lake. It comes after he's said how much he loves England (\"I love the dry, wry humour\"), and doesn't like LA (\"It's too one-sided\"); all punctuated with swearing, jokes and the confidence of a man who can wear cowboy boots, bootcut jeans (well, he does live in Texas) and still look absurdly attractive.\nI don't mean to curse at him, but it is almost too much to take, all of this, and the vision of him building a house just doesn't seem fair to the rest of the population, neither male nor female. If there was a real-life, modern-day Adam, or if Gosling in The Notebook really did exist, it would be in the form of the man sitting in front of me. Which is probably why he's saving the planet in two films this spring. First up is John Carter, a Disney action behemoth based on the 1964 book by Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs; then comes the guns-blazing Battleship, in which he stars alongside Liam Neeson and Rihanna. As if that isn't enough, Kitsch will follow with Oliver Stone's Savages, in which he plays a pot grower taking on a Mexican drug cartel to rescue his girlfriend (Blake Lively).\nIt might seem a brazen burst on to the scene but Kitsch, 30, has done his time in the waiting room. There was the almost career as a hockey player in his native Canada, until injury got the better of him, then a move to New York and a brief stint as a model. During that time he studied acting on the side and won small roles in forgettable films such as Snakes On A Plane and John Tucker Must Die. There was a stint in LA, living \u2013 literally \u2013 out of his $1,100 car, in between auditioning for parts. But it was not until getting cast as Tim Riggins in American football TV drama, Friday Night Lights \u2013 a spin off from the 2004 film \u2013 that his career kick-started his career in earnest.\n\"I played a high school kid at 26, 27; I still never use a razor, maybe to spite him,\" grins Kitsch, reclining back into his sofa. \"But I love that role, man. I was told it was to be supporting at the beginning: you're going to be used incrementally, you could be gone by the first season. But it turned out to be quite the opposite. They gave me the empowerment to be really free. No rehearsals and the most important thing to me was to be able to improv. I love to throw curveballs; all those quotes people come up to me and say about Riggins, I'd say 90% are from the improv. I'd be like, 'Hey, this paragraph here? Literally not going to do it. Just going to do a look right here.' And they'd be like, 'Let's try it!'\"\nThe confidence the role gave him obviously worked. It led to meatier parts, playing war photographer Kevin Carter in 2010's The Bang Bang Club and Gambit in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. And FNL also saw Kitsch forge a friendship with the show's director, Peter Berg, who hand-picked him for the lead role of Alex Hopper in Battleship.\n\"Pete and I go way back,\" says Kitsch, grinning, and extolling his pal in language you might expect from a veteran of a US sports drama. \"He came to pitch Battleship to me and that alone is incredible; we're friends first and foremost and we've gone through a lot together personally, so it's a big risk to ask a close friend to get in the trenches with you on a different level. Because making movies is fucking tough and you're going to bat heads and you're going to challenge each other. But I think that was why I signed on, to go to battle with Pete.\"\n'For 11 months, I was on a regimen of training and dieting. I was working six-day weeks. I would get my wake-up call at 4.33am'\nBefore Battleship, however, is John Carter \u2013 or \"JC\" as Kitsch likes to call him \u2013 an American civil war veteran transported from Earth to Mars. Not the easiest of premises to sell, but with the help of giant billboards featuring a long-haired Kitsch half-naked save for a loin cloth, one that has the potential to sell itself. It's his first lead role, and the pressure is on.\n\"I don't think anyone is going to put more on it than me,\" he says, ruffling that hair underneath his oversized beanie hat. \"Of course it's the grandeur of it all, and the effects. I don't have any power over that but the character is something you just dive into. For 11 months, I was on a regimen of training and dieting. I stayed four months at the Metropolitan hotel in Mayfair, right by Hyde Park, but I was working six-day weeks, so I literally went out once. I would get my wake-up call at 4.33am to train. But it's worth it; the aesthetic of John Carter \u2026 you can't fuck around with that.\"\nWas there a pie or two at the end of filming, then? \"Oh my god, if I even fucking told you how hard I partied after that \u2026\" he starts, going almost misty eyed. \"I rented an over-the-top house on the lake where I live in Austin, that I would never live in, like ridiculous; it was a joke. I flew in 11 of my friends, and my brother; friends that I grew up with and a few that I met through work. Eleven guys for five days, on the lake and going into the town. I fucking was a different person.\"\nHe is a confident fellow, Taylor Kitsch. We are used to a more falsely humble Hollywood these days \u2013 \"Oh I'm so lucky, oh it just happened, oh I'm so blessed\" and so forth \u2013 but perhaps because he doesn't live there, Kitsch doesn't seem to suffer from that syndrome. He will happily tell you how hard he worked to get a role. He will sing praises of those he has learned from \u2013 Willem Defoe, Dominic West, or Benicio Del Toro \u2013 and cast shadows upon those he hasn't, dismissing their methods without naming names. It may sound over-bearing but with Kitsch, such self-belief seems to come from a genuine place of simply wanting to make things happen. You sense he's used to being the best. But it's not every ex-model pretty boy who manages to land two lead roles in a year, convincing studios to take a risk on a relative unknown. How did he manage to pull it off?\n\"Oh I threatened them quite often,\" he says, grinning. \"I would love to ask them that, too. I had a call from my manager saying the director, Andrew Stanton (Wall-E), wanted to meet me. The screen test was quite heavy; John Carter has quite a burden. I think getting that part of it was a big thing [for Stanton]. But he was so emphatic and his energy was so infectious, that I left the audition thinking, 'If he gives me a good kick at it, I'm going to fight for it, I'm going to throw my hat in the ring for sure.'\"\n'John Carter tested me quite intensely. I literally suffered from exhaustion, passed out a couple of times. It took everything I had'\nFor all his fighting talk, Kitsch is the first to admit that it was not an easy ride, and not only for the training that left him physically battered and bruised.\n\"John Carter tested me quite intensely,\" he says in a southern drawl that belies the fact he's actually from a tiny Canadian town called Kelowna. \"I literally suffered from exhaustion on John Carter, passed out a couple of times from it, so it took everything I had on that level. But also, emotionally. We shot the scene where his family are taken away from him, and that's 14 hours of Carter in mourning; that's intense. If it's Friday Night Lights, you can do it because you need two takes of raw emotion. You do it for literally about 30 minutes, if that, and then you're done. This was rough, but rewarding because when you see it cut in at certain spots, fuck it can hit ya, and I love that.\"\nHe may be owning the action hero this year, but Kitsch is determined to be taken seriously as an actor. \"I love the story part of acting,\" he says. \"I love bringing people into the emotional part of it. My favourite scenes in John Carter are the emotional ones, especially when you can collaborate with Stanton, who can rip your heart out and make you cry laughing in the same breath.\"\nIt's quite rare for an action picture to have a heart, I suggest; mostly it's just brawn and battles. \"It is, but if it was one of those movies, I wouldn't have done it.\" He pauses, then with the confidence dipping a notch, says, \"I was scared shitless with Bang Bang Club. Kevin Carter was a South African, drug-addicted, suicidal war photographer, and it was a true story that his family and best friend would see. Doing that justice is way more pressure \u2026 Then shooting Savages with Oliver Stone. I think that role will turn some heads in the sense of how unapologetic the character is. ThHe just doesn't give a fuck. But that's fun.\"\nIt is an exciting time for Taylor Kitsch and if he plays things right, he could have just what he wants. Is he happy with where he is going? \"You work for years on end,\" he says, \"and it's not theatre where you can have that validation right away. You hope people love it, and you're proud of the work. I remember driving around Sunset Boulevard in the car that I was living in. Now you drive down Sunset and there is a huge John Carter billboard. I had probably about 25 people texting me about it, and that is a pretty cool feeling. But what I really love is how different these guys are. And that's the beauty of it, hopefully.\"\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\u2019re using your Android device.\nYour activity\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\n- Terms you search for\n- Videos you watch\n- Views and interactions with content and ads\n- Voice and audio information\n- Purchase activity\n- People with whom you communicate or share content\n- Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\n- Chrome browsing history you\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\u2019s saved in your account.\nYour location information\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\nDepending on the products you\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\n- IP address\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\u2019s location on or off using the device\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\nWhy Google collects data\nWe use data to build better services\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\nProvide our services\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\nMaintain & improve our services\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\nDevelop new services\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \u201cmountain bikes,\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\n- We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\n- We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\n- We don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \u201ctap to call\u201d button, we\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\nMeasure performance\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\nCommunicate with you\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\nWe\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\nYour privacy controls\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account.

(Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they\u2019ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).\nUnique identifiers\nA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.\nUnique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.\nOn other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device.

      "text": "Mars. The Red Planet. Barsoom. Edgar Rice Burroughs delivered a treasure trove of spectacle and sci-fi fantasy wonder with his John Carter series, beginning with 1912\u2019s serialized story, Under the Moons of Mars, later collected as a novel and retitled A Princess of Mars. The subject of numerous works, by Burroughs and later others, the foundational sci-fi novel remained surprisingly untapped by Hollywood, despite numerous attempts, even as Burroughs\u2019 other most famous character, Tarzan, became the subject of television serials and a glut of film adaptations.\nDisney took on the task and released John Carter into theaters 10 years ago this week. In no small sense, the hopes and dreams of the studio rested on the broad shoulders of John Carter.\nRelated Stories\nEven after the failure to launch new franchises akin to Pirates of the Caribbean with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010) and Tron: Legacy (2010), John Carter made perfect sense for Disney at the time. After all, the studio had managed to turn centuries-old fairy tales into an enterprise. And John Carter, with its strange land, smart and feisty princess, loyal animal companion, noble group of underdogs, and its mysterious and villainous wizards, was another fairy tale. Director Andrew Stanton, the filmmaker behind Disney and Pixar\u2019s masterpiece Wall-E (2008), had dreamed of seeing Burroughs\u2019 world onscreen since childhood. He could not have been a better match. And so, it was set.\nJohn Carter finalized its script and began preproduction in 2009, with a release date set for 2012, as part of a 100-year celebration of the character\u2019s legacy and impact on the genre. The perfect success story had been written in the stars, only for those stars to all come crashing down.\nLook away from Mars for a moment and consider the films that changed the course of the industry. Not necessarily the best films ever made, but the ones that served as watershed moments. There are certain movies throughout film history that drastically shifted the tide, that gave studios and audiences a glimpse of a future that could be theirs if they reached out to touch it. The Jazz Singer (1927), Gone With the Wind (1939), Ben-Hur (1959), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Jaws (1975), Star Wars (1977), Jurassic Park (1993), Titanic (1997), The Matrix (1999), Toy Story (1999), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Avengers (2012), just to name a few.\nWhether it was major leaps forward in technology, spectacle, storytelling, box office success, audience engagement or some combination of these elements, these films changed the industry and our relationship with movies, cleared the way for a glut of imitators (some more successful than others), and popularized new tools of filmmaking. When we think about films that changed the industry, we typically think about success stories, and John Carter, at least financially, was anything but.\nJohn Carter changed the film landscape, just not in the way anyone intended it to. For what it\u2019s worth, I find Stanton\u2019s film to be incredibly entertaining, far more than its 52 percent Rotten Tomatoes score would suggest. Stars Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins are compelling as John Carter and Dejah Thoris, respectively, employing the kind of classic movie-star charm that would have made them breakout performers only two decades earlier. And with a supporting cast of thespians, including Willem Dafoe, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, Thomas Haden Church, Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Dominic West, James Purefoy and Bryan Cranston, John Carter spared no expense in giving the film a sheen of legitimacy.\nWhile certain pundits love to look back in mockery of all the actors from the past decade that Hollywood tried to make into stars but couldn\u2019t, Kitsch brought something to the role beyond just classic looks. Burroughs\u2019 Carter is something of a blank slate, the strong heroic white man whom readers could project themselves onto. But Kitsch brings a certain slyness to the role, in which Carter\u2019s seeming naivete hides a watchful intuition. Similarly, Collins, redefines Dejah Thoris from the nearly naked damsel in distress to Barsoom\u2019s chief scientist and a warrior who frequently out-fights Carter. So many of the traits we now associate with Wonder Woman\u2019s onscreen depiction \u2014 her curiosity, strength, resolve to save lives, all while refusing to shy away from romance \u2014 were present in Collins\u2019 Thoris. There is no question that these two actors had the capability to lead a franchise and delve deeper into these characters.\nBeyond John Carter managing to remain largely true to the source material while also modernizing the characters and story for new audiences, Stanton, alongside co-writers Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon, brings a sense of warmth and humor to it. This is a film that revels in its pulp sensibilities and has no shame in the fact that science fiction has become exceedingly complicated since Burroughs\u2019 stories first came to print. While we\u2019ve reached a point where some of our most popular blockbusters wink and nudge the audience over the ridiculousness of the concepts and characters, Stanton\u2019s approach is never anything less than genuine. From the four-armed Tharks to the speedy lizard-dog Woola and Carter\u2019s jumping feats, Stanton manages to take the most implausible aspects of the book and give them believable weight and physicality, even in an age when more is known about Mars and the laws of physics than Burroughs could even fathom. Stanton applied the rules of animation to live-action, giving implausibility a kind of charm reminiscent of Max Fleischer\u2019s Superman cartoons.\nJohn Carter earned just $284.1 million on a $306.6 million budget. What makes the box office failure so frustrating is that I don\u2019t believe this to be a case where anything could have been done differently. With the filmmaker, cast and technology at hand, John Carter was the best adaptation of A Princess of Mars that could have been made and seems will ever be made. Michael D. Sellers explores what went wrong following positive test screenings, and how the film became one of the biggest box office bombs of all time, in his book John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood. The fact that Stanton did not have the opportunity to make his two planned sequels, Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars, remains, in my mind, one of Hollywood\u2019s great missed opportunities. If John Carter had been a success, Disney\u2019s film slate may look very different today.\nWhen I think about the box office discussions surrounding John Carter, the first thing I think of is the \u201cLegacy\u201d featurette, released as a final marketing push for the film. In that featurette, the names of Star Wars and Avatar are invoked, as works inspired by Burroughs\u2019 stories. (You could add Dune to that list as well.) James Cameron even cited A Princess of Mars as one of his central inspirations for Avatar (2009), and the similarities \u2014 a soldier coming to a new planet, being accepted among its native tribe, stirring unrest and ultimately saving the planet from an ecological nightmare \u2014 could not be clearer. It\u2019s almost a cruel twist of fate that John Carter got going mere months before Avatar\u2019s release shattered box office expectations.\nThis is not to suggest that Avatar does not have many of its own merits, or that if John Carter had beat it to the box office, it would have been anywhere near the same success story. But it does beg the question of what John Carter had to offer that was different for audiences, beyond science fiction nerds invested in the evolution of familiar narratives. If John Carter inspired Star Wars and Avatar, the attitude of some sci-fi audiences was that they\u2019d rather just watch those stories instead.\nDisney realized the same thing that audiences did. Why merely evoke Star Wars when we can have Stars Wars? Six months after the release of John Carter, Disney purchased Lucasfilm, giving the company the right to George Lucas\u2019 kingdom, which was inspired by Flash Gordon, John Carter and all the pulp-stories that predated it. With Lucasfilm alongside Marvel, Disney no longer had to dig into the archives to find those untapped intellectual properties it could try to spin into gold.\nThe box office flop The Lone Ranger (2013) certainly didn\u2019t help matters, but John Carter\u2019s failure was the moment Disney became the servant of sure bets, and Hollywood realized star power was truly gone. That was when we entered the age of name recognition, where familiar characters and concepts \u2014 Jedi, superheroes \u2014 became worth more than any actor\u2019s name. A lot of beloved films, series and filmmakers have emerged in that new age, and I\u2019m certainly no one to wag my finger at it. But as we sit 10 years removed from John Carter, I can\u2019t help but look at the landscape of 2022, a year that boasts the miniseries Obi-Wan Kenobi and the film Avatar 2, now also owned by Disney. I find myself thinking about the anticipation built on the sands of Barsoom and the bones of John Carter, and wondering if we lost something or simply surrendered to the passage of time, something that not even a 110-year-old story can withstand in the realm of Hollywood.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

      "text": "While Amazon Prime would, of course, like to be seen as a one-stop shop for all kinds of content (and like its competitors, the headache-inducing number of shows and films being spewed out does mean that there really is something for everyone), there has become a notably strange sweet spot for the streamer. The retailer\u2019s first show might have been Joey Soloway\u2019s intimate family drama Transparent, exploring gender and sexuality with sensitivity, and its most awarded might be The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, a female-fronted comedy about female comedy, what\u2019s being most watched continues to be a very different story.\nFor it\u2019s the red-blooded, dad-would-like action narratives that seem to have connected the most, from the long-running success of Bosch to the much-watched Tom Clancy adaptations Jack Ryan and Without Remorse to the impressive numbers for the army v aliens thriller The Tomorrow War to, most recently, the record-breaking viewership of Lee Child\u2019s Reacher (one could superficially nestle The Boys alongside for those who haven\u2019t quite grasped the show\u2019s pretty easy-to-grasp satire). It\u2019s not all been bad per se but it\u2019s mostly been indistinctive, a gung-ho formula of guys and guns that offers very little in the way of surprise. The Terminal List is an inevitable algorithmic amalgamation of the above with The Tomorrow War\u2019s Chris Pratt heading up an adaptation of a Jack Carr novel, whose military adventures file next to both Clancy and Child, writers he\u2019s expressed admiration for. But it\u2019s familiar to a fault, a tired and tiring series unfurling on Independence Day weekend for those looking for a low-stakes post-barbecue watch, a slab of barely heated red meat that\u2019s all extremely hard-to-chew gristle.\nPratt plays James Reece, whose life is turned upside down after his platoon of Navy Seals is killed during a botched mission overseas. Upon returning back to his family (an adoring wife and a young daughter he takes hunting) memories of what happened shift and Reece convinces himself that some sort of conspiracy is afoot, one that might threaten the lives of those that he loves.\nIn a recent interview, Pratt, who on the same press tour has shown understandable annoyance over Twitter voting him \u201cthe worst of the Chrises\u201d, revealed that the allure of a return to television was the ability to see a story that would have felt rushed and shallow at 90 minutes get the expansive eight-hour treatment, allowing ancillary characters depth and development. What\u2019s most head-scratching about this reasoning, which has oftentimes turned good stories into great ones, is just how much this particular tale suffers from the long-form format. The Terminal List is the kind of straight-to-Redbox three-beers-deep actioner made by the dozen, usually starring Chad Michael Murray or Bruce Willis or Chad Michael Murray and Bruce Willis, that works best with little to no thinking time. When spread across eight, punishingly dull episodes, all of its many, many cracks star to tear the whole thing apart.\nDrably directed in part by Antoine Fuqua (who, since Training Day, has specialised in anonymous point-and-shoot action fodder), it\u2019s astonishingly pedestrian and aggressively unexciting stuff, a flat and all-too-easy-to-predict revenge saga that plays by the basest of rules, our embittered hero violently working his way through the bad guys like he\u2019s in a video game, all the way up to the boss level (hilariously he does cross them off on a hand-written list which allows for the unintentionally incredible line: \u201cStay off my list!\u201d). What the show fails to reckon with is just how deranged Reece\u2019s mission ends up being, his methods often hewing closer to those of Jigsaw (a torture scene involving intestines is as gratuitous as it is stupid) and quite often possessing not an iota of interest in how many other, innocent lives could be affected. A more interesting script would have grappled with his sadistic selfishness but creator David DiGilio is far too busy cheering from the sidelines (at one point a character says of Reece: \u201cGuy\u2019s a legend, total patriot\u201d).\nIt\u2019s a passion project for Pratt, who hasn\u2019t been shy about his military obsession, but you would not know from watching the actor giving arguably his laziest performance to date, lethargically shuffling through scenes like he\u2019s just here for the cash, unable to bring any real shades of humanity to an admittedly half-a-note character (how Carr has turned Reece into a five-book franchise is a genuine mystery). What made Pratt such a revelation in Guardians of the Galaxy was his ability to transplant his well-trained sitcom timing to a genre that can often feel rigid and humourless, a leading man that prized freewheeling goofiness over staid stoicism. But his choices have since lost any of that fizz, turning him into yet another bland gym lug, promise squandered. There\u2019s little of interest for anyone else to do, from a mostly unconvincing Constance Wu as an exposition-spouting journalist to a cartoonishly evil Jai Courtney as a big tech baddie to Taylor Kitsch slumming it as a quippy soldier pal to a bizarrely thankless role for the wonderful Riley Keough on wife duty. The only real fun is watching Jeanne Tripplehorn as secretary of state, relishing a much-deserved second career wind.\nIf Amazon\u2019s recent history is anything to go by, this will probably be an easy win but for those who might have curiously added it to this summer\u2019s watch list, I\u2019d recommend crossing it straight off.\n-\nThe Terminal List is now available on Amazon Prime Video"

We cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.\nWhen we share your personal data\nWithin the Guardian group of companies\nDepending on where you live, we may share your personal data within the Guardian group of companies in the UK, US, or Australia. We may share it in order to perform a contract with you, for administrative purposes, or when we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example:\n-\nIf you book an event held in Australia, at first we may hold your data on our systems in the UK and then we may share it with the Guardian in Australia for administration purposes.\n-\nSometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of the Guardian. We may decide to share this with the Guardian Archive run by the Guardian Foundation for historic and archiving purposes.\n-\nWe may share your data to understand how you interact across our group products or to tailor and offer relevant advertising to you.\nWith external organisations\nWe share your personal data with other organisations that are not directly linked to us under the following circumstances:\nService providers - We may share your data with other organisations that provide services on our behalf.

The embedded player relies on the YouTube API, which is a type of software that allows data to be communicated between our website and apps and the YouTube player. This will include personal data which will also be collected by cookies as set out in our cookie policy. We will provide this data about how you interact with videos to enable YouTube to provide statistical information such as how many views a video has, or how many users watch the entire video. More information about how YouTube will use this personal data, which includes usage data when you interact or use the embedded YouTube player, can be found at the Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy.\n-\nSkimlinks because they are an affiliate marketing service provider. We do not drop first or third party cookies, or otherwise access local storage through our affiliate links. Instead we use a type of link that redirects users into Skimlinks\u2019 network. This means we are tracking and identifying the click, rather than individuals. Skimlinks will use IP addresses to direct readers to the geographically relevant affiliate link. The IP address and user agent are anonymised and truncated by Skimlinks. Third party sites including retailers and sites in Skimlinks\u2019 network may place cookies or collect additional information. Details about Skimlinks use of data is set out in their privacy policy at https://skimlinks.com/privacy-policy.\nAdvertising partners - We may also share your data collected through our sites with our advertising partners, as set out in our cookie policy. These partners help us deliver relevant advertising across our sites. For example, we use Google Ad Manager to assist us with the delivery of relevant ads.\nThese partners may also generate their own identifier from your device or email address for the purpose of personalised advertising. You can find details about these partners\u2019 use of data and opt out of their identifiers through the following links:\n-\nLiveRamp: https://liveramp.uk/privacy/service-privacy-policy/ and opt out - https://liveramp.uk/privacy/your-rights/\n-\nID5: Privacy policy - https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy/ and opt out - https://id5-sync.com/privacy\n-\nLotame: Privacy policy - https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-notices/services/ and opt out - https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-manager/\n-\nThe Trade Desk: Privacy policy - https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/privacy and opt out - https://adsrvr.org/\n-\nEUID: Privacy policy - https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/privacy and opt out - https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/\n-\nUID2: Privacy policy - https://transparentadvertising.com/privacy and opt out - https://www.transparentadvertising.com/\nAffiliate marketing - When a product is linked from a Guardian article or gallery, if the retailer has an affiliate programme, then the link will redirect to the retailer website through our affiliate marketing partner, such as Skimlinks\u2019 network. When a reader clicks on a link, Skimlinks will identify which page the click came from and assign it a randomly generated number. This is communicated to the retailer and associated with any subsequent purchase. The affiliate marketing partner, such as Skimlinks, then reconciles the list of clicks from links on the Guardian with purchases on the retailer\u2019s site. This is used in order to calculate the commission for the Guardian.\nAgencies and authorities if required by law - We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in response to a valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or warrant). If we have your contact details, we will take reasonable steps to attempt to notify you prior to disclosing your data unless (i) prohibited by applicable law from doing so, or (ii) there are clear indications of unlawful conduct in connection with your use of Guardian services.\nEvent sponsors and partners - We may share your personal data with sponsors of Guardian events and partners who we hold events with for marketing purposes when you have given your permission for us to do so.

We may also share your data with entities offering any prize you have won in order for that entity to contact you about such a prize.\nSocial media organisations - We may share your personal data with other organisations when our web pages use social plug-ins from these organisations (such as liking or sharing on social media). These other organisations may receive and use personal data about your visit to our sites or apps. If you browse our site or view content on our apps, personal data they collect may be connected to your account on their site. For more information on how these organisations use personal data, please read their privacy policies.\nOrganisation/s that buy any of the Guardian group companies - We may share your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.\nWhen we share your personal data, as specified above, with any organisation which accesses your data in the course of providing services on our behalf, they will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your data and comply with applicable law. We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.\nCalifornia resident - Do not sell\nThese transfers to third parties may constitute \u201csale\u201d of your personal information under California law. A California resident can halt these sales at any time by pressing the \u201cCalifornia resident - Do not sell\u201d link that is located in the footer of every page on our site. Third-parties do not sell personal information that has been sold to them by the Guardian unless you have first received explicit notice and are provided an opportunity to exercise the right to opt out.\nInternational data transfers\nData we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our Guardian group companies or service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.\nWhenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:\n-\nWe will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.\n-\nWe may also use specific approved contracts that use Standard Contractual Clauses for the protection of personal data where appropriate, with our service providers that are based in countries outside the UK or the EEA, including those based in the US and Australia. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the UK or the EEA.\nIf you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the UK or the EEA.\nHow long we keep your personal data\nWe keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep your personal data while you are still using our product or service. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription.\nIf we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing communications in the future.\nHow we may contact you\nService communications\nFrom time to time we will send you service emails and in line with your communication preferences, such as by push notification or SMS, to notify you of payment failure, T&C changes including price changes, or to thank you when you contribute or place an order with us.\nMarketing communications and editorial newsletters\nIf we have your permission or you have not opted out, we may send you materials we think may interest you, such as new Guardian offers and updates.
