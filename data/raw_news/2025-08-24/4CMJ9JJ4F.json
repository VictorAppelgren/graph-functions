  "title": "Unbelievable dog row at popular caf\u00e9 divides Aussies",
  "description": "A caf\u00e9 in one of Australia's trendiest suburbs has found itself at the centre of a dog saga, prompting intervention from the local council and sparking a divide among locals.",
  "content": "The owners of a popular caf\u00e9 have blasted council for fining them after a customer made a complaint about their dog walking around in the kitchen.\n\nLa Bottega in Leichhardt, Sydney's inner west, was hit with an $880 penalty, with Inner West Council warning further fines could follow if the practice continued.\n\nIt came after a disgruntled diner left a one-star review, claiming they were thrown out by the 'unprofessional' owners after complaining about their dog, Pongo.\n\nThe dachshund had become a mascot of the caf\u00e9, with its owners breaking the news he would no longer be around to greet diners.\n\n'With a very heavy heart, I need to share some news,' they wrote in an Instagram post.\n\n'The council has fined us $880 and informed me that they'll continue to fine us daily if Pongo is here during the week.'\n\nThe caf\u00e9 owners explained they had been forced to find other arrangements for someone else to look after their dog during business hours.\n\n'This means our little Pongo will now be spending his weekdays in daycare, and sadly won't be here to welcome you and your puppy friends for the time being,' they wrote.\n\nDespite the setback, the caf\u00e9 promised the fight wasn't over.\n\n'But there's always light at the end of the tunnel,' the post read.\n\n'I'll keep fighting to bring Pongo back where he belongs, greeting our customers in the place he loves to call home,' it added.\n\nThe post followed a scathing one-star review accusing the caf\u00e9 of breaking the law and lashing out at concerned customers.\n\n'Please be aware that they have dogs roaming freely inside, including the kitchen area, which is very clearly illegal,' the review read.\n\n'When we questioned, the explanation was 'they are the owners!'.\n\nThe reviewer said they lodged a complaint with the council, which likely led to the $880 fine.\n\n'I took a picture as I am intending to report it to the council and the Food Authority, and when they saw that they became very disrespectful and literally threw us out of the caf\u00e9,' the review said.\n\n'In my 15 years in Australia, this is the first time I have seen such unprofessional and arrogant behaviour.\n\n'They can be sure I will be reporting them to the council and the Food Authority and follow it up to the end.'\n\nThe post was met with many people agreeing with the complainant.\n\n'But the dog was in the kitchen which is a health and safety hazard?? Why are these commenters fighting to have a dog in a restaurant kitchen?' said one person.\n\n'So all these people saying it's ok would be fine if it were rats instead? I'm a dog lover, but do not want a dog in the kitchen of a restaurant,' another said.\n\n'If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t go,' one said.\n\n'And how many people have pets at home that are in the kitchen and on counters I wonder,' another said.\n\nDaily Mail contacted La Bottega and Inner West Council for comment.",

  "summary": "The owners of a Sydney caf\u00e9, La Bottega, have criticised the Inner West Council for fining them $880 after a customer complained about their dog, Pongo, walking around in the kitchen. The council has warned that further fines could be issued if the practice continues. The caf\u00e9 owners have been forced to find someone else to care for their dog during business hours. This follows a one-star review by a customer who claimed they were thrown out of the caf\u00e9 by the owners after complaining about Pongo. The review accused the caf\u00e9 of breaking the law by allowing dogs to roam freely inside, which is clearly illegal. Despite this setback, the caf\u00e9 has promised to keep fighting to restore Pongo to his rightful home.",
  "shortSummary": "A popular Sydney caf\u00e9 faced backlash for fining its owners $880 for allowing their dog in the kitchen, leading to a customer complaint and subsequent fines.",
