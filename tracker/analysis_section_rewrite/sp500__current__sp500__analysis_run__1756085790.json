      "feedback": "This draft is a reasonable, headline-first synthesis but it needs a tighter, numbers-backed 0–3 week frame and a clear causal/pathway map. Actionable edits: restructure into a three-scenario, date‑driven outline (base/bull/bear) anchored to explicit near‑term catalysts and dates from sources (PubMatic lead-plaintiff deadline Oct 20, 2025; Biohaven lead-plaintiff deadline Sept 12, 2025; Spirit Aviation going-concern disclosure Aug 11, 2025 with a ~40.7% one‑day drop; Hutchmed acting CEO announcement and ASCO data window) and state the expected market reaction function (risk-on if a favorable settlement path or governance clarity; risk-off on adverse updates or failure to certify) with probabilities. Strengthen the causal chain by tying each driver to a specific transmission mechanism (litigation risk premia and headline risk lifting discount on securitization of future cash flows; governance signals affecting biotech funding/partnership sentiment; data flow from SACHI interim results and any ASCO communications). Quantify where possible from sources (lead-plaintiff deadlines; going-concern drop magnitude; contingency-fee structure; no-certification caveat) and avoid hedged language; for Hutchmed, separate the immediate governance/leadership dynamic from the clinical data signal and note the known data window versus what would constitute a disappointment. Add explicit thresholds and invalidation criteria (e.g., “if there is no new filing/settlement chatter by X date, or if Spirit’s going-concern risk is not meaningfully alleviated by the next update, then tilt to a downside scenario”), and map monitor items to dates (filings updates, court actions, Rosen notices, Spirit disclosures, Hutchmed ASCO webcast). Reconcile overlaps across sources by consistent citations (keep 4LDHF4T77, 4VN4UTWX1, Z5IA1CYUF, Y4QWID79M; add concrete figures such as the 40.7% one‑day drop and the two Rosen lead-plaintiff deadlines, with no extrapolated numbers). Finally, sharpen the prose for horizon focus: crisply state “immediate drivers,” “near-term catalysts and positioning,” and “levels/thresholds to invalidate the base case,” then end with a 1–2 sentence monitor plan.",
