      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Add missing citations** – The threshold line (“5–10 % decline in spx, a Shiller CAPE ratio falling below 35, and a rebound in tech earnings that lifts the Nasdaq above its 1‑month MA”) needs citations. Use (F52SBHPFR) for the CAPE threshold, (B1KYJ1GPU) for the 1‑month Nasdaq MA, and (5GZPY1XUE) for the tech earnings rebound.  \n2. **Specify dates for catalysts** – Include the exact dates of the next Fed policy announcement (Sept 16‑17 FOMC) and the Shiller CAPE update (Sept 8 2025). Add inline citations: (B1KYJ1GPU) for the Fed cut signal, (F52SBHPFR) for the CAPE update.  \n3. **Clarify causal chain** – Re‑phrase the paragraph on risk‑premium tightening to explicitly state: “High CAPE + concentration → elevated risk‑premium → Fed’s dovish stance → potential risk‑off shift.” Use citations after each link.  \n4. **Trim excess wording** – Remove the sentence “Fed Governor Christopher Waller’s dovish stance—signaling a 25‑bp cut at the September FOMC and further cuts in the next 3–6 months—has already begun to lift equity sentiment, but it also signals that inflationary pressures may persist, thereby tightening the risk‑premium environment (B1KYJ1GPU).” Replace with a concise 1‑sentence: “Fed’s 25‑bp cut signal (B1KYJ1GPU) raises risk‑premium expectations, tightening equity sentiment.”  \n5. **Maintain focus on spx** – Ensure every claim ties back to the S&P 500. The current draft is fine, but double‑check that no unrelated asset (e.g., DXY, gold) is mentioned.  \n6. **Use canonical naming** – Keep the handle as “spx” throughout; avoid “S&P 500” in prose.  \n7. **Add invalidation clause** – Explicitly state: “If the Nasdaq rebounds above its 1‑month MA or if the Fed cuts rates more aggressively, the 5–10 % correction risk is invalidated.” Cite (B1KYJ1GPU) for the Fed cut and (B1KYJ1GPU) for the Nasdaq MA.  \n\nImplement these edits to tighten the analysis, satisfy citation requirements, and keep the focus razor‑sharp on the S&P 500 over the 0–3 week horizon.",
