  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Nvidia stock experienced an intense sell-off earlier this year, driven by uncertainty around tariffs and competition in China.\n\u2022 None Rising infrastructure spending by its largest customers suggests that demand remains strong across the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape.\n\u2022 None Despite a strong rebound over the last few months, valuation trends suggest that emerging AI opportunities may not be fully reflected in the share price yet.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a\n\nThis year has been an emotional roller coaster for shareholders of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Following the news of new tariffs, in combination with intensifying competition in China, the company's shares plummeted by as much as 30% earlier this year, wiping out nearly $1 trillion in market value.\n\nSuch precipitous declines may have suggested that Nvidia's best days were in the rearview mirror, but the stock's more recent performance says otherwise.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAs of Aug. 7, it had rebounded by 93% from its 2025 lows and now has a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.\n\nWith such strong momentum fueling the stock to new highs, is it too late to invest in Nvidia? Read on to find out.\n\nNvidia's largest source of revenue is its computing and networking business. This segment comprises the company's data center services and highly coveted graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nA good way to gauge the health of its business is to look at spending on artificial intelligence (AI). The chart below illustrates capital expenditures over the last three years for cloud hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, along with social media company Meta Platforms.\n\nThese \"Magnificent Seven\" companies prove that accelerating AI infrastructure spending is a powerful tailwind for Nvidia's chip empire.\n\nBeyond the usual tech titan suspects, rising adoption of cloud infrastructure services from Oracle -- as well as neocloud platforms such as Nebius Group and CoreWeave -- offer another source for GPU demand, especially for Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture. Neoclouds are gaining interest at the moment as they offer flexible software-hardware stacks in the form of high-performance computing (HPC) services and access to GPU clusters via cloud-based infrastructures.\n\nOver the last few years, investors have repeatedly heard pundits chirp about the importance of data centers in powering generative AI development. This point is valid, but I think many investors are missing the broader picture when it comes to the evolution of AI infrastructure spending.\n\nA new phase of AI adoption involves sophisticated workloads across robotics, autonomous driving, and quantum computing. Companies such as Alphabet and Tesla are beginning to monetize their autonomous vehicles, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are all developing their own custom quantum computing chips.\n\nNvidia has just started to scale up its chips and CUDA software platform across these emerging opportunities. Given the company's existing deep integration with big tech, I'm optimistic that its product suite will still be crucial in future, more-advanced AI development.\n\nWhat will Nvidia stock be worth by the end of 2025?\n\nThe chart below illustrates the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple throughout the AI revolution.\n\nGiven the trends cited above, the forward P/E range between 24 and 30 could be seen as a support zone or valuation floor for Nvidia. Each time its forward P/E dipped into this range, the stock has rebounded strongly. To me, this suggests that investors still see robust long-term growth for the company despite occasional fleeting periods of souring sentiment.\n\nI think these valuation trends subtly imply that the market could be underestimating the full breadth of Nvidia's ubiquitous platform. Despite the company's influence across AI infrastructure, many investors still view it purely through the lens of a semiconductor business. As these new opportunities are realized, I think the stock is well positioned for a prolonged breakout -- similar to the initial wave of AI-driven enthusiasm a couple of years ago.\n\nAlthough its forward P/E is fast-approaching prior highs, I think there is a solid case to be made that the company is positioned for further valuation expansion and could reach or exceed historical levels. My logic is that the monetization potential of future opportunities in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and quantum computing is still taking shape and not yet fully priced into the stock by investors.\n\nIf Nvidia's current forward P/E expands to levels congruent with prior highs by the end of the year, the stock could blow past the $200 price point and reach closer to $220 -- implying an increase between 10% and 20% over current price levels. For this reason, I think Nvidia stock will be trading significantly higher by the end of the year than where it is today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,119,863!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nAdam Spatacco has positions in Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.

      "text": "One pocket of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm that continues to gain momentum is quantum computing. So far this year, the Defiance Quantum ETF has posted gains of 15% -- handily outperforming both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\nWhile market-beating gains have tempted some growth investors to dive headfirst into the quantum computing revolution, I'd caution that not every opportunity in this area of the AI industry carries the same upside.\nLet's explore eight of the most popular quantum computing stocks right now and determine which ones are the best of the bunch for investors with a long-run time horizon.\nEveryone is talking about these four quantum computing stocks, but...\nWhenever a new theme begins to emerge within a broader megatrend, investors often try to identify the \"next big opportunity.\" What I mean by that is throughout the AI revolution, investors have been repeatedly reminded of how great the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are.\nBut now that quantum computing is becoming an increasingly popular topic within the broader AI discussion, more speculative investors are seeking to find new opportunities that could potentially mimic returns similar to those of the Magnificent Seven.\nAt the moment, four of the most popular quantum computing stocks are IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and the appropriately named Quantum Computing. While it's tempting to follow outsize momentum, all four of these quantum computing stocks deserve a closer look before investors begin to pour in.\nFirst, all of these businesses are investing heavily in research and development (R&D) and capital-intensive projects as they explore quantum technology. This is an important nuance for investors to understand. None of these companies is generating significant or consistent revenue yet. This could be considered a risk, as these businesses are not yet offering various product lines that are commercially scaled.\nGiven the lack of sales coming through the door, it shouldn't be surprising to learn that these small companies are burning through quite a bit of cash -- making long-run liquidity a major concern. For now, each of these quantum computing hopefuls has relied on stock issuances in order to raise funds. Not only is that dilutive to shareholders, but it's not a sustainable method of capital raising in the long run.\nAll of these quantum computing stocks are trading for valuations far beyond what investors witnessed during prior stock market bubbles. Management may understand this and are taking advantage of frothy conditions to raise as much capital as possible before valuations protract and become more appropriately aligned with the fundamentals of their respective underlying businesses.\n...I like these four magnificent stocks even better\nWhile it may seem a little anticlimactic, I think the most prudent way to invest in quantum computing is through the usual suspects: the Magnificent Seven. Cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have largely been tied to hefty investments in data centers, servers, and chips over the last few years. However, each of these companies has quietly been exploring quantum computing, too.\nAll three of these Magnificent Seven members have developed their own custom quantum computing chips, called Majorana, Ocelot, and Willow. On top of that, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is exploring quantum applications by offering new, extended features of its existing CUDA software system.\nThe reason that I like big tech over the speculative players above is that each also has a multibillion-dollar business spanning various pockets of the AI realm. In other words, quantum computing represents an extension of an already established footprint.\nBy contrast, companies such as IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing are essentially singularly focused businesses whose long-run viability hinge on successful business execution and penetration of the quantum computing industry. If they fail to achieve a critical mass in terms of enterprise-level customers, these companies could quickly run through their remaining capital and be headed toward a path of insolvency.\nWhich quantum computing stock is the best of the bunch?\nAt a high level, I think there are merits to owning any of the big tech stocks referenced above. But if I had to choose just one, I'd pick Nvidia as my best quantum computing idea.\nI see Nvidia as the most ubiquitous business among megacap technology AI stocks. The company already dominates the data center and chip landscapes, and with more sophisticated use cases across autonomous vehicles, robotics, and now quantum computing starting to emerge, I'm hard-pressed to think of how or why Nvidia won't continue to be a major source powering these applications.\nIn my eyes, Nvidia has much more room for growth beyond the core chip business in the long run. For this reason, I think Nvidia stock is a no-brainer right now."

      "text": "Autonomous vehicles represent a critical chapter in the broader artificial intelligence (AI) narrative. Unlike chatbots or recommendation algorithms, autonomous vehicles portray a confluence of more nuanced, sophisticated protocols -- sensory processing, smart control systems, and dynamic logic converging into a single platform.\nIn essence, the rise of self-driving vehicles represents a shift from reactive tools with specific -- and sometimes limited -- applications to full-blown intelligent robotics systems integrated with the physical world.\nWhile Tesla and Alphabet's Waymo receive much of the attention in autonomous vehicle technology development, I see Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) as the company with the most upside in this space.\nLet's explore how Nvidia is quietly playing a role in the autonomous driving landscape, and detail just how big of an opportunity this is for the king of the chip realm.\nHow does Nvidia fit into the autonomous driving equation?\nNvidia offers a variety of AI infrastructure platforms that can be deployed across autonomous vehicle applications. Through its DGX platform, software developers can train neural networks to better understand a variety of real-world driving scenarios.\nFrom there, these models can be stress tested through Nvidia's Omniverse platform, which allows developers to build detailed virtual environments and create vivid driving-related simulations. This is a critical service, as it allows companies to tweak and validate their autonomous vehicle systems prior to deploying services in the real world.\nNvidia already has a number of strategic partnerships in its autonomous vehicle ecosystem, including General Motors, Rivian Automotive, Toyota, BYD, Nuro, Lucid Group, Polestar, and Nio.\nHow big of an opportunity is autonomous driving for Nvidia?\nEstimates surrounding the total addressable market (TAM) for autonomous vehicles vary greatly. This is due to the fact that autonomous vehicles have a variety of different use cases, many of which are yet to reach a critical mass at this point in the AI revolution.\nAccording to Markets.us, the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41% through 2032 -- reaching a size of $4.2 trillion by early next decade.\nIf that sounds overzealous, consider that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has even projected a multitrillion-dollar opportunity at the intersection of robotics and automobiles.\nPer the chart above, Nvidia's automotive segment is still quite small compared to the company's data center business, which generates well in excess of $100 billion in annual revenue.\nWith the automotive business generating less than $2 billion in sales over the last year, Nvidia hasn't even captured 1% of the autonomous vehicle market. And yet, given the company's existing relationships with so many leading automobile manufacturers, I remain optimistic that the commercialization and wider adoption of autonomous vehicles will represent a transformative tailwind for Nvidia's business beyond data centers and chips.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\nAs of this writing, Nvidia trades for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40. On the one hand, the chart clearly illustrates that this is well below the levels that Nvidia has previously witnessed. But on the other hand, trading at 40 times forward earnings is far from cheap.\nNevertheless, I tend to think that investors are largely valuing Nvidia based on its dominance in the AI data center market. In other words, I think that most investors are not accounting for long-term opportunities such as autonomous driving when it comes to Nvidia.\nIn my eyes, Nvidia is largely viewed as a chip designer and less as a full-stack software and hardware ecosystem spanning across myriad machine learning applications. In reality, Nvidia is far more prolific and ubiquitous than a semiconductor business.\nWhile autonomous vehicles are not yet a mainstream AI application, Nvidia is uniquely positioned for growth as the technology scales. Moreover, given its agnostic approach to autonomous vehicle systems, I see Nvidia as less risky than betting on one horse, such as Tesla or Waymo, to win the race.\nFor these reasons, I think Nvidia is a no-brainer buying opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon."

Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services.

      "text": "For a few years now, the artificial intelligence (AI) movement has largely hinged on the performance of a single company: Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%).\nSure, if Microsoft or Amazon posted strong results from their respective cloud computing platforms or if Tesla managed to hype investors up over the prospects of self-driving robotaxis or humanoid robots, the technology sector might see a fleeting upward movement. At the end of the day, however, the focus seemed to eventually return to Nvidia -- with analysts obsessing over how demand for the company's chips and data center services were trending.\nDuring the first half of the year, Nvidia's ship was caught in an epic storm. Investors started to question the company's long-growth prospects -- inspiring prolonged periods of panic-selling in the process. All told, Nvidia's market cap dropped by more than $1 trillion.\nBut now, with a market value north of $4 trillion, Nvidia has reclaimed its position as the most valuable company on the planet. Even better? Some on Wall Street are calling for further gains of up to 400%.\nLet's explore the tailwinds supporting Nvidia's long-term growth narrative and detail why Wall Street sees such massive upside for the king of the chip realm.\nOne Wall Street analyst is calling for a $10 trillion valuation for Nvidia\nOne of the most bullish Nvidia analysts on Wall Street is the I/O Fund's Beth Kindig. Kindig suggested that Nvidia could reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030 -- implying 140% upside from current levels. Let's explore the main catalysts supporting Kindig's forecast.\nAccording to management from Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, roughly $260 billion will be spent in 2025 alone on AI infrastructure. On top of that, Meta Platforms is expected to spend roughly $70 billion on capital expenditures this year -- nearly double what it spent in 2024. Lastly, Oracle is beginning to make significant headway in infrastructure services -- allowing companies to rent Nvidia GPUs from their cloud-based data center platform. From a macro perspective, rising capex from the cloud hyperscalers bodes well for chip demand.\nKindig takes these secular tailwinds one step further, suggesting that competition from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices does not pose much of a threat to Nvidia's dominance. While it's hard to know how vendor preferences could change over the next several years, current industry research trends suggest that Kindig might be right -- underscored by Nvidia's rising market share in the AI accelerator industry.\nThe area of Kindig's analysis that I think is currently overlooked the most revolves around Nvidia's software architecture, called CUDA. Since CUDA is integrated tightly with Nvidia's hardware, developers essentially become locked into the company's ecosystem.\nNot only does this lead to customer stickiness, but it opens the door for Nvidia to be at the forefront of more sophisticated, evolving AI applications in areas such as robotics and autonomous driving.\nWhat about $20 trillion?\nFormer management consulting executive Phil Panaro is even more bullish than Kindig. By 2030, Panaro thinks Nvidia's share price could reach $800 -- implying roughly a $20 trillion market cap.\nPanaro cites opportunities across Web3 development and evolving use cases around how enterprises and governments leverage AI to generate more efficiency and cost savings as the main pillars supporting Nvidia's upside.\nWhile these trends could eventually drive significant demand for Nvidia's data center services, tech adoption within the government tends to move slowly. Meanwhile, Web3 remains an emerging concept that could take far longer to mature than Panaro is assuming.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy right now?\nNvidia stock has been mounting an epic comeback over the last couple of months. This valuation expansion can be easily seen through the dynamics of the company's rising forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. Nevertheless, Nvidia's forward P/E of 40 is still well below levels seen earlier this year.\nTrying to model Nvidia's peak valuation is an exercise in false precision. The bigger takeaway is that analysts on Wall Street are not only calling for significant upside in the stock, but they have outlined the foundation for Nvidia's long-term growth. The important theme here is that Nvidia has opportunities well beyond selling chips -- many of which have yet to make meaningful contributions to the business.\nI see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer. Investors with a long-run time horizon might consider scooping shares up at current prices and plan to hold on for years to come."

      "text": "Since artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as the stock market's next major trend a couple of years ago, a small concentration of mega cap technology companies have become favorites within investment circles.\nThe collective, known as the \"Magnificent Seven\", includes cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, consumer electronics maker Apple, electric vehicle (EV) pioneer Tesla, social media behemoth Meta Platforms, and chip designer Nvidia. While many of these stocks have produced market-beating returns over the last couple of years, a new force is emerging in the AI realm.\nAs of closing bell on July 3, shares of Oracle (ORCL 0.27%) have gained 42% in 2025. This handily outperforms any of the Magnificent Seven, as well as the broader indices such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite.\nLet's dig into the catalysts pushing Oracle stock higher. In addition, I'll detail a new deal the company signed and explain why it represents a transformative shift for the database management provider.\nOracle announces a $30 billion cloud deal\nAs investors know, businesses across the world have been spending billions over the last couple of years buying chipsets and building data centers as part of their AI roadmap. Oracle isn't an exception to these patterns. What is unique, however, is Oracle's approach to monetizing these assets.\nOracle offers its customers infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). What that means is businesses that want access to GPUs and AI-equipped data centers can do so through the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This is advantageous for customers, as it essentially allows them to rent the AI products they need as opposed to building time-consuming and expensive data centers themselves.\nPer a recent 8-K filing, Oracle just signed a cloud deal that is \"expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue\" starting in fiscal year 2028.\nWho is Oracle's new cloud infrastructure customer?\nThe 8-K filing did not reveal who Oracle's new cloud infrastructure deal is with. However, based on some breadcrumbs, I've narrowed it down to two potential candidates.\nShortly after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, Oracle founder Larry Ellison joined OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the White House to announce a joint venture known as Project Stargate. The goal of Stargate is to invest $500 billion into AI infrastructure projects over the next several years.\nConsidering OpenAI's recent strategic partnership with Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I would not be surprised if the ChatGPT developer is looking to complement this new deal with Oracle's infrastructure services as part of the Stargate vision.\nAnother potential candidate could be G42, which is a holding company that focuses on various AI services based in Abu Dhabi. Over the last couple of months, several American AI developers including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Cisco have signed Sovereign AI deals -- particularly with countries across the Middle East.\nGiven Oracle already works with G42 through a partnership with Cleveland Clinic, it's possible the two AI companies deepened their partnership through this new cloud deal.\nIs Oracle stock a buy right now?\nFrom a macro perspective, AI infrastructure spending could eclipse trillions of dollars by next decade -- according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. While Oracle's cloud infrastructure services appear to be benefiting from these secular trends, so is the company's stock price.\nPer the graph below, Oracle's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35 is among the highest across leading cloud infrastructure players. In addition to its premium multiple, the recent ascent in Oracle's valuation relative to its peers is hard to deny.\nIn my view, these trends could suggest that some of the upside from Oracle's infrastructure business and its new deal are already priced into the stock.\nNevertheless, my conviction remains high regarding Oracle's long-term growth prospects. I am encouraged by the company's ability to win new deals for its OCI operation, especially ones that provide investors with visibility into growth years down the road.\nFor these reasons, I still see Oracle stock as a compelling opportunity beyond the usual Magnificent Seven suspects and think now is a great time to scoop up some shares."

      "text": "Valuation expansion is an important concept that, if used correctly, can enable investors to achieve superior returns and avoid overpaying for a stock. Unfortunately, it's easy to underestimate its importance because it can appear to be an esoteric concern, so I'll try to keep things straightforward.\nWhat is valuation expansion?\nWhat is valuation expansion?\nSimply put, valuation expansion occurs when the market assigns a higher multiple to a company's earnings, cash flows, or any other valuation metric you might choose to use. For example, before a valuation expansion, a stock with $10 in earnings might trade for 10 times its earnings, so its share price would be $100.\nFast forward one year; the company has generated $15 in earnings, and the market has decided to expand the valuation multiple on the stock (valuation expansion) to 20 times earnings, so the stock now trades at $300. In other words, it's tripled in value.\nIt's essential to pause and understand that if the valuation expansion hadn't occurred, the valuation would have been 10 times the $15, so $150. In addition, note that if its earnings had stayed at $10, but the market had still granted the stock a valuation expansion to 15 times earnings, the new valuation would be $150.\nAs such, valuation expansions are significant for returns and can produce excellent returns even if earnings stay the same.\nWhat causes it?\nWhat causes valuation expansion?\nThere are three leading causes of valuation expansion:\n- A fundamental increase in one of its key metrics, such as profit margins or cash flow generation.\n- A change in industry trends or end market dynamics.\n- A shift in market sentiment towards a stock or a sector in general.\nFundamental changes\nCompany fundamentals change constantly, and if you can identify a positive and lasting trend in one of them in a company, it could lead to the market granting the stock a valuation premium.\nFor example, consider Trimble (TRMB 1.25%), a workflow and positioning company. Although the company's roots lie in positioning hardware, its long-term software and services revenue is growing, which comes with higher margins and cash flow. As such, when Trimble starts demonstrating that it can increase its profit margins and cash flow generation, the market might be willing to give it a higher valuation multiple (based on near-term metrics) to reflect the step change in its long-term earnings potential.\nOn the other hand, some companies experience short-term improvements in metrics that don't prove sustainable, even as the market has priced them on a higher valuation multiple. In this scenario, the ensuing drop in margins and correction in the valuation multiple can lead to disappointing share price performance.\nA change in industry trends and end markets\nAn example of a change in industry trends and end markets comes from technological or regulatory change significantly improving the company's prospects.\nOne example of a technological change comes from the increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and digital technology in the industrial sector. As more companies adopt digital technology and industrial software, the adjacent market for automation solutions will benefit. Simply put, the benefit of using automation is magnified when powered by digital technology and advanced AI-powered analytics.\nAn example of regulatory change comes from the global regulatory environment favoring hybrid and electrical vehicle (EV) adoption and renewable energy technologies. Investors see these trends in copper mining companies as a net positive because they imply more demand for electrification and copper wiring used in EVs and electricity transmission and distribution networks.\nOf course, these trends can change, and caution is needed before firmly concluding they are here to stay.\nA change in market sentiment\nArguably, this is the most exciting cause of valuation expansion because the changes in sentiment can sometimes be violent, leading to dramatic changes in stock prices over time -- specially if it is accompanied by strong earnings growth.\nConsider the old-fashioned industrial conglomerate. Investors used to have a favorable view of conglomerates such as the former General Electric, so it was easy for the company to keep making acquisitions. One reason is that investors value companies more highly as part of a conglomerate. All General Electric had to do was acquire a relatively lower valuation and wait for the market to give the new company at a higher multiple when it became part of the overall company.\nBut that was then, and this is now. Industrial conglomerates are out of fashion now, and the market applies a valuation discount to the sum of the parts in a conglomerate. At least, that's part of the argument about why former industrial giants like United Technologies, 3M (MMM 1.62%), Danaher (DHR 3.01%), and General Electric have broken up or spun off significant businesses. In this case, breaking up an industrial conglomerate will result in a valuation expansion for the separate companies since they are seen as better able to generate shareholder value than stand-alone companies.\nThe difference between the two scenarios is mainly due to sentiment, which can change over time.\nRelated investing topics\nHow to use it\nUsing valuation expansion in investing\nThe examples above illustrate how investors might identify an aspect of a company's fundamentals, industry trends, or market sentiment that will result in the market pricing in a valuation expansion for the stock. This is a useful tool in any investor's arsenal, and utilizing it can lead to good returns."

      "text": "CUDA Programming might be the most important technology most people have never heard of. CUDA is at the heart of the graphics processing unit (GPU) and AI ecosystems for Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and is a major reason why the company dominates the market for data center GPUs. Keep reading to see why and learn more about CUDA.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is CUDA programming, exactly?\nAccording to Nvidia, CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that enables developers to write code and build applications on Nvidia's GPUs. Parallel computing refers to a type of computing architecture in which several processors simultaneously perform small calculations to break down a larger problem.\nThat makes Nvidia's AI technology easy to use and customize. It also gives Nvidia a competitive advantage over other chipmakers and AI companies.\nHow it works\nHow does CUDA programming work?\nCUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform, which means it's capable of executing multiple parts of a single program simultaneously rather than one at a time. This means CUDA can deliver faster processing times and use computing resources more efficiently.\nThose advantages are especially valuable during the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, as speed and efficiency are key points of differentiation. Developers also favor CUDA because they are accustomed to using it and it's a big time-saver for them.\nNvidia released CUDA in 2006 and has continued to upgrade and build an ecosystem around it since then. Other AI companies are still trailing far behind it. Developers don't even need to write code for CUDA because it already has libraries of programs built on it, called CUDA-X libraries.\nOverall, CUDA reinforces the GPU ecosystem that has made Nvidia so successful. Moreover, it helps deliver higher performance and accelerated computing.\nNvidia's edge\nHow CUDA gives Nvidia a competitive advantage\nNvidia popularized the GPU in 1999, and CUDA, which it introduced in 2006, has arguably been its most important step in establishing itself in the GPU market. Recognizing the significant demand for accelerated computing empowered by GPUs, Nvidia developed libraries for applications like deep learning and linear algebra that have helped form the building blocks for its work in AI.\nRunning AI programs requires significant computing power. CUDA and Nvidia's accelerated computing are able to do just that through the parallel computing model that enables multiple simultaneous computations.\nDue to Nvidia's dominance in data center GPUs and the hardware that enables AI, CUDA is becoming the de facto platform for AI. It has the advantage of already being built, making it more attractive for developers.\nCompetitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) have introduced alternatives, such as ROCm, but they have failed to gain widespread adoption. It will be difficult to unseat Nvidia and CUDA as the central components for running AI programs.\nThousands of GPU-accelerated applications have been built on CUDA. The platform offers flexibility and programmability that have made it attractive to developers, according to Nvidia.\nRelated investing topics\nWhat's next\nWhat's next for CUDA\nNvidia is currently focused on scaling CUDA for massive data center computing so that it can run across a data center through a single runtime system rather than on individual GPUs. Nvidia has also been working on a multinode CUDA runtime system to meet the scale of the data center.\nThe last major update for CUDA, CUDA 12, was released in 2022 with its Hopper architecture, and it's unclear when CUDA 13 will be released. That may be taking a backseat to the updates for its AI strategy.\nOverall, Nvidia recognizes CUDA's importance and the competitive advantage it creates, and the company will continue to invest in it. For the many companies that rely on Nvidia architecture, that also means it will become even easier and faster to develop the kind of AI applications that run on Nvidia hardware. So, expect CUDA to continue playing a key role in pushing Nvidia's technology forward."

      "text": "Forward P/E is a valuation metric that uses earnings forecasts to calculate the ratio of the share price to projected earnings per share. The \"P\" in forward P/E stands for price, or share price. The \"E\" stands for future earnings per share.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is forward P/E?\nForward P/E is a variation of the price-to-earnings ratio that uses an estimate of earnings over the next 12 months to calculate the metric. Unlike the trailing P/E, which uses actual earnings results from the previous 12 months, the forward P/E is based on estimates, and is therefore subject to errors in forecasting.\nTo combat the potential to get the estimated earnings wrong, the forward P/E is typically calculated using a consensus estimate from all analysts who have published their expectations. This wisdom of the crowd approach typically leads to more accurate estimates.\nHow to calculate it\nHow to calculate forward P/E\nThe formula for calculating a forward P/E ratio is very straightforward.\nForward P/E = Current share price / Estimated future earnings per share\nThe hard part is determining the estimated earnings per share. Several resources provide consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts for big companies. Some companies, however, only have a few analysts (and sometimes none) publishing estimates. In those cases it may be worthwhile to dig into the company financials, management\u2019s commentary, and build your own estimate to aggregate with the professionals.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say a stock currently trades for around $150 per share. Analysts expect it\u2019ll produce earnings per share of $6 over the next year. That stock has a forward P/E ratio of 25.\nHow to use it\nHow to use forward P/E\nCalculating the forward P/E of a stock isn\u2019t very useful in and of itself. To get something out of it, you need to calculate the forward P/E of other comparable stocks.\nComparing the forward P/E of two or more companies within the same industry can give you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If one stock has a P/E far greater than its peers, the stock might not be a very good deal.\nBut there are good reasons why a stock may have a high forward P/E. If analysts expect that company\u2019s earnings per share to grow significantly faster than its peers, it\u2019ll value the next 12 months of earnings far higher than a slow-growing company. That\u2019s because a stock price reflects all the future cash flows of a business, not just the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s important to consider that a forward P/E uses earnings per share, or EPS, in the denominator. EPS is itself a ratio, which is affected by the number of shares outstanding. So, if a company has plans to buy back a large percentage of its shares outstanding through a share repurchase program, investors may be willing to pay more for its earnings today.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations of forward P/E\nTo calculate a price-to-earnings ratio, a company needs to have earnings. But not every company produces positive earnings for its shareholders.\nEarly-stage growth companies often produce losses, but their operations show strong potential for earnings at some point in the future. While they invest to grow the business, leverage their fixed operating expenses, and move toward profitability, their stocks technically trade for a negative P/E ratio.\nProfit\nEven when those companies start to make a profit, their relatively minuscule profits relative to the number of shares outstanding can lead to P/E ratios with triple or even quadruple digits. Those valuations aren\u2019t useful for an investing thesis, and forward P/E falls flat in those cases.\nInvestors will be better off finding a different valuation metric to compare growth stocks that are still generating losses for investors. Just because they have extremely high or non-existent forward P/E ratios doesn\u2019t make them bad investments."

It has captured that position several times in 2024 and 2025, and during that time, it has also recorded both the largest one-day gains and losses in Wall Street history.\n2. Microsoft\nConsidering the popularity of the Windows operating system, it\u2019s no surprise that Microsoft has consistently ranked as one of the largest companies in the world. Over 70% of computers use Windows, according to Statcounter. While it's most famous for Windows, Microsoft also has a diverse selection of products and services that has helped to build on its success, including:\n- Office Suite software\n- Azure cloud platform\n- Xbox video game consoles\n- Surface computer and tablets\nMicrosoft has been making a big push into AI technology. It launched an AI-powered digital assistant, Microsoft Copilot, and it invested $88 billion in AI-enabled data centers during its 2025 fiscal year (which ended on June 30, 2025). It's also partnered with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, although there have been recent reports of tension between the two companies.\n3. Apple\nTech giant Apple is proof of how far high-quality products and strong brand loyalty can go. It first became the world's most valuable company on Aug. 9, 2011, 15 days before Steve Jobs resigned as CEO, and has spent quite a bit of time at the top since then. It also holds the distinction of being the first company to hit market caps of $1 trillion, $2 trillion, and $3 trillion.\nApple built its success off sales of its wildly popular products, including the iPhone, MacBook, and AirPods. It has branched out into services, including its Apple TV+ streaming service. And it's developing Apple Intelligence, an AI technology, although the rollout of new features has been slower than anticipated.\nOn a negative note, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. It alleges that Apple illegally maintains a monopoly over smartphones through contractual restrictions on developers. The Trump administration's import tariffs are also expected to cause a significant financial burden.\n4. Alphabet (Google)\n- Market cap: $2.30 trillion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $371.4 billion\n- Gross profit (TTM): $218.9 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 20.82%\n- Year founded: 1998 (Google), 2015 (Alphabet)\nAlphabet is the holding company created through a restructuring of Google in 2015. Of course, Google is most well-known as a search engine, becoming so famous that the name is synonymous with online searches. That's just one of Alphabet\u2019s many widely used products, which also include:\n- Email service Gmail\n- Video site YouTube\n- Navigation apps Waze and Maps\n- Pixel smartphones\nGoogle's dominance over online searches hasn't been without controversy, as Alphabet has been embroiled in antitrust lawsuits. In August 2024, a judge found that Google acted illegally to monopolize online search and advertising. The court hasn't decided on penalties yet, and Alphabet plans to appeal the ruling.\n5. Amazon\nE-commerce leader Amazon started out as an online bookstore, which goes to show just how much its reach has expanded. It's now the site where you can buy practically anything, and it\u2019s the largest online retailer in the world.\nThe company\u2019s Amazon Prime service has more than 200 million users worldwide. It's also the largest cloud provider in the world with Amazon Web Services (AWS). And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Amazon also has its Amazon Prime Video streaming service and video game streaming through Twitch, plus it owns the Whole Foods Market grocery chain.\nYet it isn't all good news. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 17 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon in September 2023 alleging that Amazon is a monopoly that uses anti-competitive practices to maintain its position. While the lawsuit is ongoing, Amazon won a partial dismissal in a September 2024 ruling.\nCompanies 6-10\n6. Meta Platforms\n- Market cap: $1.89 trillion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $178.8 billion\n- Gross profit (TTM): $146.5 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 24.32%\n- Year founded: 2004\nThe company formerly known as Facebook rebranded in 2021 and announced a new focus on building the metaverse. More recently, Meta Platforms has been investing heavily in AI. It launched its first Meta AI app, an AI assistant, in April 2025. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also went on a hiring spree for top talent and announced Meta Superintelligence Labs in June. The organization aims to develop AI superintelligence, a theoretical stage of AI that would surpass humans in practically every area.\nFor now, Meta Platform's biggest products are its social networks, Facebook, and Instagram. It also owns WhatsApp and Messenger, and it expanded into virtual reality with its Meta Quest devices and its acquisition of Oculus. Meta makes the vast majority of its money from advertising, which accounts for about 98% of its revenue.\n7. Saudi Arabian Oil\n- Market cap: $1.57 trillion* (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $478.1 billion*\n- Gross profit (TTM): $230.2 billion*\n- Five-year annualized return: -2.15%\n- Year founded: 1933\n*Converted from Saudi riyals.\nSaudi Arabian Oil, also known as Saudi Aramco, is an energy and chemicals company. Owned by the Saudi Arabian government, it has the largest daily oil production and the second-largest proven crude oil reserves of all oil companies.\nSince Saudi Aramco is largely dependent on oil prices, it can go through significant ups and downs. Heavy oil demand helped it claim the top spot in terms of market cap early in May of 2022, but when demand fell, it was surpassed again. This year, a decrease in crude oil prices and demand has negatively impacted Saudi Aramco's business, and the oil company has cut its dividend as a result.\nTo diversify its portfolio, Saudi Aramco invested $500 million in a liquified natural gas (LNG) company, MidOcean Energy, in September 2023. It also signed a joint development agreement with China's BYD Company (OTC:BYDDY), the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, in April 2025.\n8. Broadcom\n- Market cap: $1.36 trillion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $57.0 billion\n- Gross profit (TTM): $37.7 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 59.26%\n- Year founded: 1961 (HP Associates), 2005 (Avago Technologies), 2016 (Broadcom Limited)\nBroadcom started out as HP Associates, the semiconductor division of HP (NYSE:HPQ). It's now one of the largest semiconductor companies and develops custom chips for multiple hyperscalers.\nIn addition to its semiconductor business, Broadcom also has infrastructure software products. It significantly increased the size of its software division with the acquisition of VMware in November 2023.\n9. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n- Market cap: $1.22 trillion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $114.3 billion*\n- Gross profit (TTM): $67.2 billion*\n- Five-year annualized return: 26.56%\n- Year founded: 1987\n*Converted from New Taiwan dollars.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also known as TSMC, is a leader in semiconductor production and is Taiwan's most valuable company. As such, it works with many of the leading global technology companies, including Apple and Nvidia. It's another of the tech companies benefiting from the growth of AI. It's the largest contract chip manufacturer in the world, and demand for AI chips has led to increased sales for TSMC.\nTSMC is in the process of expanding its semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S. It has announced plans to invest $165 billion in U.S. fabrication plants, advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D team center. However, it has also warned that further import tariffs on Taiwanese semiconductors could reduce demand and damage its U.S. investment plans.\n10. Berkshire Hathaway\n- Market cap: $1.02 trillion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $383.9 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 19.34%\n- Year founded: 1839\nBerkshire Hathaway is the first U.S. company outside of the tech sector to have a $1 trillion market cap. It started out as a textile company and remained in that business for more than a century, but it's now known for its ties to legendary investor Warren Buffett. He began investing in Berkshire in 1962, took majority control in 1965, and converted it into a holding company in 1970.\nAfter nearly 60 years as Berkshire's CEO, Buffett announced he'll be stepping down from that role in January 2026. Greg Abel will be his successor. While Berkshire's main business is insurance (it owns one of the largest insurance companies, GEICO), it has also invested in companies across a range of industries.\nCompanies 11-15\n11. Tesla\n- Market cap: $976.12 billion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $92.7 billion\n- Gross profit (TTM): $16.2 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 25.94%\n- Year founded: 2003\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are growing in popularity, and no company has been riding that wave more than Tesla. It's the most valuable automaker in the world. The Tesla Model Y was the world's best-selling car in 2023 and 2024.\nTesla is most famous for its vehicles, and it's second only to BYD Company in terms of manufacturing. That's not all it has to offer, though. In addition to EVs, Tesla also manufactures solar roofs, solar panels, and Powerwall, an integrated battery system that stores solar energy.\nTesla has had a turbulent 2025 so far. Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk's entry into politics at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led to backlash against the automaker in the form of boycotts and even vandalism of Tesla vehicles. Musk has since left his role as a special government employee in May, but he has also recently been feuding with President Trump.\n12. JPMorgan Chase\n- Market cap: $804.19 billion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $275.5 billion\n- Gross Profit (TTM): $163.7 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 27.88%\n- Year founded: 1799 (Bank of the Manhattan Company), 2000 (merger of JPMorgan and Chase)\nWhile there are several big banks in the U.S., JPMorgan Chase is the biggest. It managed $4.00 trillion in assets at the end of 2024, more than any other U.S. bank and the fifth-highest in the world.\nJPMorgan has launched multiple ventures in the growing cryptocurrency market. It partnered with Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), one of the leading crypto exchanges, in July. The partnership makes it easier for the bank's customers to invest in cryptocurrency. JPMorgan also launched a deposit token, JPMD, in June.\n13. Walmart\n- Market cap: $785.99 billion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $685.1 billion\n- Gross profit (TTM): $170.5 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 19.63%\n- Year founded: 1962\nWalmart may not have the largest market cap, but it is No. 1 in terms of revenue, and it\u2019s the largest retailer in the world. With more than $600 billion in annual revenue, it earns more than most of the other companies on this list by a wide margin.\n14. Eli Lilly\n- Market cap: $722.49 billion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $49.0 billion\n- Gross profit (TTM): $40.0 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 39.95%\n- Year founded: 1876\nFounded by a chemist and Union Army veteran of the same name, Eli Lilly is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.

It focuses on business hardware and software products, including cloud infrastructure and applications.\nThanks to demand for cloud-based AI services, 2024 was Oracle's best year in decades. Oracle is also one of the initial equity funders for Stargate, a project announced in January 2025 to build U.S. AI infrastructure.\nCompanies 16-20\n16. Visa\n- Market cap: $657.97 billion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $38.9 billion\n- Gross profit (TTM): $30.9 billion\n- Five-year annualized return: 13.04%\n- Year founded: 1958\nVisa is the most widespread payment network in the world, and it processes transactions for prepaid cards, debit cards, and credit cards. It's accepted in over 130-million merchant locations across more than 200 countries and territories, and it reported $13.2 trillion in payments volume in its 2024 fiscal year.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa in September 2024. It alleges that Visa operates an illegal monopoly over the debit card payments market. Visa is contesting the lawsuit.\n17. Tencent\n- Market cap: $616.82 billion (as of August 1)\n- Revenue (TTM): $91.7 billion*\n- Gross profit (TTM): $48.5 billion*\n- Five-year annualized return: 1.68%\n- Year founded: 1998\n*Converted from Chinese yuan.\nTencent is an internet and technology company, and it's the most valuable publicly traded company in China.

It's also the world's second-largest oil company behind only Saudi Aramco.\nTakeaways\nTakeaways for investors\nLarge-cap stocks like these are an important part of every investor's portfolio. They generally provide more safety and stability than smaller stocks since most of them are established companies with strong brands.\nThey can be highly profitable as well; 15 of the stocks on this list outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. Tech companies, in particular, can often be profitable investments. They make up the top five -- and eight of the top 10 -- largest companies by market cap.\nYet even with the biggest companies in the world, no investment is a sure thing. A diversified portfolio is still a must so that you're not overly reliant on any single company or market sector.\nSources\n- JPMorgan Chase & Co.

  "argos_summary": "Nvidia's stock has seen significant fluctuations this year, initially dropping due to tariff concerns and competition in China, but rebounding by 93% to a market cap of $4.4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company.
