  "description": "UK responsible sourcing trade show Source Fashion has announced its next instalment will take place at Olympia London on 13 to 15 January 2026.",
  "content": "The show has been moved to an earlier than normal date (January 2026) which organisers say \u201cfirmly places Source Fashion at the start of the fashion sourcing calendar, and unites global manufacturers and suppliers with retailers, brands and wholesalers across every product category.\u201d\n\nIt also marks the first time the event has partnered with Trend Suite as its official fashion trend authority, delivering fresh insights and directional guidance to energise buying, sourcing and product teams.\n\nTrend Suite is founded by trend forecaster and designer Tiffany Hill, who brings her expertise fully into the show, curating insight around emerging subcultures and creative signals that influence fashion\u2019s future. Trend Suite will collaborate on the headline trend theme for January 2026, soon to be revealed, and join the content programme with insight-led sessions designed to inspire and inform across categories.\n\n\u201cBy partnering with Trend Suite, the show will spotlight the power of data-driven trend forecasting in shaping collections that are not only creatively inspiring but also commercially successful. This collaboration will provide visitors with exclusive insights into the key directions set to define the 2026\u201327 seasons, empowering brands and buyers to make smarter, more sustainable choices,\u201d she said.\n\nSource Fashion July 2025 saw record visitor numbers and a 51% year-on-year increase in total footfall, its biggest increase to date with buyers, sourcing managers, product developers, technologists, and designers from some of retail\u2019s biggest names, brands and retailers including LVMH, Harrods, Burberry, Victoria Beckham, Temperley, Bella Freud, Lyle & Scott, French Connection, John Lewis, AllSaints, ASOS, Joseph, Marks & Spencer, Next, New Look, Primark, River Island, Mango, Joules, JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9, Sosander, Gigi & Olive, Lucy & Yak, Yumi International, Damson Madder, Godske, Jaded London, Tottenham Hotspur and Jermyn Street Design and more.\n\nSource Fashion event director Suzanne Ellingham added: \u201cWhat makes Source Fashion so powerful is the quality of conversations happening on the show floor.\n\nFrom emerging brands looking for ethical partners to global retailers sourcing at scale, the feedback from exhibitors and visitors shows that this is where meaningful, lasting business starts. Our role is to connect people and create the environment for better, more responsible fashion, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll continue to deliver this January. With the addition of Trend Suite as our first official fashion trend partner, we\u2019re also able to give buyers and suppliers a clearer view of the creative signals shaping the future of fashion, adding another layer of inspiration and insight to the show.\u201d",
