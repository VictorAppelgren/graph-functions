      "feedback": "This draft is a solid baseline but falls short of world‑class in regime framing, first‑principles grounding, and explicit, source‑tied quantification; to upgrade, reframe around a transparent, multi‑year, first‑principles model (anchor on ROIC vs WACC, cash conversion, and capex intensity) and embed a macro/industry regime map that drives Ford’s pricing power and cash flow, not just narrative about EVs or valuation multiples. Specifically, after a concise opening, anchor the horizon with invariant anchors drawn directly from the sources: Ford’s Q2 EV segment loss of about $1.3B, overall adjusted operating margin ~4.3%, and ROIC near 10% (22PL3Q360); the stock’s implied cheapness with forward P/E around 8–10 and a roughly 5% dividend yield (W2622L6WW); and the EV capex dynamic, including Ford’s plan to delay up to $12B of EV spending until capacity demand requires it (IGP1Q4ZEJ). Build a three‑regime scenario: Regime A (base): cyclical but stable auto demand, EV losses narrowing but not profitable, cash flow sufficient to cover the dividend; Regime B (transition): EV/Model E profitability approaches, capex pacing eases, margins expand modestly; Regime C (tariff/rate stress): tariff headwinds and higher rates depress demand and raise costs, risking margin compression; specify transition triggers and thresholds (e.g., EV segment margin breakeven by year X, capex pacing shift by Y dollars, or a tariff tariff‑pass‑through that materially alters pricing power). Quantify the base case with a tangible cash‑flow path (e.g., 2–3% top‑line growth, mid‑single‑digit EBIT margins, FCF coverage sufficient to sustain the dividend) and a plausible valuation path (e.g., 9–11x forward earnings, or a base‑case total return that trails the S&P over the horizon if EV profitability stalls), with every assertion tied to its source ID (22PL3Q360 for mechanics, W2622L6WW for multiples/dividend, IGP1Q4ZEJ for EV capex/capability pacing). Add an explicit invalidation rule (e.g., if EV margins stay negative for two consecutive quarters and ROIC fails to beat WACC for six+ months; document how that would re‑price the stock). For Catalysts/Trigers/Watch, assign clear dates or quarterly milestones (EV margin breakeven, Model E unit cost reductions, tariff announcements, or a material capex re‑phase) and specify the number‑level sensitivity (e.g., how a 25 bp rise in rates or a $5–$10B swing in EV capex would alter FCF and valuation). Finally, tighten the prose to a consistent causal chain: macro regime → Ford’s fixed costs and capex intensity → EV profitability path → cash flow generation → market pricing; replace the “millionaire maker” framing with disciplined long‑term value dynamics, and present a compact 3–5 bullet watch list with confidence band.",
