  "content": "Even when it\u2019s your product, leadership sometimes means getting a little uncomfortable.\n\nWhich felt a bit ironic, considering wellness is literally what we do. It\u2019s our product. Our mission. Our reason for showing up. So naturally, when I saw the low engagement, my first instinct was frustration. But then I had a more honest thought: If people aren\u2019t engaging, what am I doing to lead it?\n\nNow, I\u2019ve used video plenty of times before to rally the team. It\u2019s one of my go-to tools, especially in a hybrid environment. And I\u2019ve done a variety of fitness and endurances races, so people usually think I\u2019m \u201cthe fit one.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t one of those moments. I\u2019ve been recovering from an injury. This wellness challenge happened to land during a time when I hadn\u2019t worked out in months. I wasn\u2019t feeling like an athlete. I was feeling like someone whose body wasn\u2019t quite ready, but whose team needed a little spark. So I threw on Eye of the Tiger, dropped to the floor, and recorded myself doing pushups. Grunts, forehead vein, bad lighting\u2014everything stayed in. I didn\u2019t write a script, and I didn\u2019t overthink it.\n\nWhat happened next was the point A couple hours later, two team members recorded their own videos. Within a day, the chat thread turned into a mini movement with people cheering each other on, firing off emojis, and trading jokes about sore muscles.\n\nThere\u2019s a trap a lot of leaders fall into (me included), believing that our role is to point the way, and others will follow. Especially when the thing we\u2019re pointing to is already built, branded, and rolled out with good intentions. When it\u2019s your product, your challenge, or your initiative, you assume your enthusiasm is contagious. It isn\u2019t. Not by default. You can\u2019t always motivate from behind a keyboard. Sometimes, you\u2019ve got to lead with action.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to be the loudest person in the room. But it does mean you need to be first, especially when what you\u2019re asking is new, different, or just a little uncomfortable. It\u2019s about going first (not going perfect) In hindsight, it wasn\u2019t the video that worked. It was the willingness to be a little silly. A little human.\n\nPeople joined because they saw effort. They saw someone willing to put themselves out there, even if the moment wasn\u2019t peak performance. In fact, I think it helped that this was my first physical activity in months. It made it real. Approachable. Not a flex, just a start. Sometimes, going first means doing the thing that feels awkward. And sometimes it means doing the thing you used to be good at, but haven\u2019t done in a while. Either way, it invites others in.",

  "summary": "The author of the Wellness Challenge explains why he used a video to motivate his team by doing pushups on camera, despite not feeling like an athlete and feeling frustrated at low engagement. He found this an opportunity to connect with his team, which he believes is their mission and their product. The video was used to motivate the team and inspired them to record their own videos and engage in the process. Despite not being the best at a professional level, the video's impact was seen as a powerful motivator who made the team feel more engaging and engaging. The author argues that leaders often fall into the trap of believing that their role is to point the way and others will follow, especially when their product is already established.",
