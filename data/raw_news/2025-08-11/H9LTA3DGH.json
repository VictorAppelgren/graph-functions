  "content": "ST. CHARLES, Ill. \u2014 Leaving behind his nearly nine months pregnant wife, Kendall Scudder trekked to Tulsa, Okla., on June 28 to meet with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\nScudder, the newly elected chair of the Texas Democratic Party, arranged to have a private meeting with the governor at the site of a fundraiser for Oklahoma Democrats, where Pritzker was a keynote speaker. One of the topics he wished to broach was a persistent rumor circulating in Austin for months: redistricting.\n\n\u201cI knew that we needed to start forming relationships with partners outside the state in the event that we needed to use those relationships,\u201d Scudder said.\n\nFive weeks later, Scudder had a 2-week-old son, Lyndon \u2014 named for the former president and his wife\u2019s father \u2014 and an exodus of state House Democrats from Texas was underway, with dozens secretly fleeing to Illinois to block a vote on a partisan gerrymander that could flip as many as five Democratic-held seats to Republican control.\n\nFor the past week, the Texas House has been at a standstill after Democrats refused to show up on Aug. 4, denying the chamber a constitutionally required quorum to conduct legislative business. Their move \u2014 known as a quorum break \u2014 blocked a vote on congressional redistricting sought by President Donald Trump, as well as more than a dozen other items Gov. Greg Abbott placed on a special session agenda \u2014 most notably efforts to address the Hill Country floods that killed at least 137 people.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News spoke with more than 20 House Democrats and staff who have been decamped in Illinois for the past week. Their accounts offer an inside look at how they decided to employ the nuclear option to block redistricting and how they pushed redistricting into the national spotlight amid Republican backlash and growing security concerns.\n\nRep. Ramon Romero Jr., D-Fort Worth, said he first heard rumors of redistricting in the early spring. Education policy dominated the session. It seemed there would be little room for something as politically thorny as redistricting.\n\n\u201cNo one really took it seriously,\u201d Romero said.\n\nDemocrats dismissed the rumors in part because the Legislature approved redistricting in 2021, further solidifying Republican majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature and adding two more seats for Republicans to Washington.\n\nThe rumors lulled, but returned in late May during the final weeks of the biennial 140-day session of the Texas Legislature.\n\nRep. Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said the session came to a close, and he heard Abbott might try to redistrict Texas in a special session.\n\nAfter the session ended, Abbott issued an 11th-hour veto of a ban on hemp-derived THC products. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick was incensed over the torpedoing of what is one of his top legislative priorities. But it also gave Abbott a clear path to call a special 30-day legislative session.\n\nAbbott had made an initial list of items he told lawmakers would appear in an upcoming special session. THC was on the list. Redistricting wasn\u2019t.\n\nBut then the July 4 floods came. That, Wu said, was when whispers of redistricting rose to a roar.\n\n\u201cPeople in the know realized that Abbott would use the Kerrville disaster as cover to do redistricting,\u201d Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the hairs on the back of my neck went up and I kind of said, \u2018Oh, crap.\u2019\u201d\n\nAbbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said in a statement that Democrats\u2019 flight from the state was a \u201cpublicity stunt,\u201d and that the governor has \u201cdeployed all available resources and support to help communities respond and recover.\u201d Any relief funds, Mahaleris added, would need to be appropriated by the Legislature.\n\n\u201cIf Texas House Democrats care about the Texans they abandoned, they will return to Austin and do the job they were elected to do,\u201d he said.\n\nOn July 7, the U.S. Department of Justice penned a letter to Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stating that four congressional districts in Texas violated new caselaw on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that weakened legal claims protecting \u201ccoalition districts\u201d \u2014 districts in which a combination of nonwhite communities comprises a majority.\n\nTwo days later, Abbott called a special session that included redistricting, citing the DOJ letter in his proclamation.\n\nThe session began on July 21, and legislative hearings on redistricting started rapidly.\n\nOver nine days, the House and Senate held nine hearings on redistricting. Most occurred before the proposed map was made available to lawmakers and the public. They included hearings in Austin, Houston and Arlington.\n\nAt every hearing, lawmakers heard near-universal opposition to the plan. Democrats on the committees lodged bitter complaints, at times calling the effort a racist attempt to disenfranchise people of color. Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, described the public hearings as a \u201cdog and pony show.\u201d\n\nRepublican heads of the committees disagreed with the Justice Department\u2019s conclusion that the 2021 maps violated the Voting Rights Act. But those same leaders said the disagreement was a moot point, pointing to U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2019 and 2024 that stated political gerrymanders were legal as long as race was not taken into account.\n\n\u201cI frankly don\u2019t care what the DOJ letter said, and I think it\u2019s pretty clear that no one does on the prevailing side of this bill,\u201d said the chair of the House redistricting committee, Rep. Cody Vasut, R-Angelton. \u201cThis bill was not based off of that DOJ letter. It was based off of political performance.\u201d\n\nWhen the maps were revealed on July 30 in House Bill 4, the proposal showed redrawn districts that dismantled three urban districts \u2014 one each in North Texas, Houston and the Austin/San Antonio area \u2014 that heavily favored Democrats. Two South Texas swing districts were reconfigured to be more favorable for Republicans.\n\nIf 2024 election results hold true in 2026, Republicans would gain five seats \u2014 the exact number Trump had requested.\n\n\u201cThe trickery and the power grab became so obvious,\u201d said Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, a San Antonio Democrat on the House redistricting committee.\n\nThe House redistricting committee held one final round of public testimony on the maps before approving and sending them to the House floor. It was during that 15-hour hearing that House Democrats crossed a threshold \u2014 enough had agreed they would be willing to leave the state in order to block a vote.\n\nWu, who fellow House members elected as their caucus chair in 2024, said that as House Democrats weighed whether to break quorum, he stressed that they would make the decision together, not as an edict.\n\nTo be sure, Wu said he was in favor of breaking quorum. And in the process, Democrat representatives set up a system of \u201cwhips,\u201d representatives who regularly gauged their colleagues\u2019 feelings about breaking a quorum.\n\nWhen Wu counted 51 members willing to abscond from the state, the whips began making calls telling Democrats to pack their bags.\n\nRep. Mihaela Plesa was tending her rose and vegetable garden in North Dallas on Friday when she got the call.\n\n\u201cI immediately was taken back to the stories my grandparents told me about how they had to flee Romania and how they had to fight back against fascism,\u201d Plesa said.\n\nRep. Vince Perez was in his backyard in El Paso playing with his dogs when he got the call on Friday night.\n\n\u201cI was probably one of the last ones to get the call,\u201d the first-term lawmaker said. \u201cAs a new member, I\u2019m maybe at the bottom of the totem pole.\u201d\n\nRep. James Talarico, D-Austin, was studying the maps at his Capitol office on Saturday when he got the call.\n\n\u201cYou have to be OK knowing that you\u2019re going to get asked to leave with not a lot of notice,\u201d Talarico said.\n\nMidday Sunday, Aug. 3, Democrats from across the state were en route to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York. By the early evening, their flight became public.\n\nBy the time House Democrats were in front of cameras alongside Pritzker, who assisted them by finding lodging and meeting spaces, the backlash had already begun.\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton said he would \u201chunt down\u201d absent Democrats. Abbott said he would use the courts to remove them from office if they didn\u2019t return in time for the scheduled vote on the redrawn congressional maps.\n\nAfter it became clear on Aug. 4 that enough Democrats had left to halt business in the House, Speaker Dustin Burrows issued civil warrants for their arrest that have empowered state law enforcement to detain and force lawmakers to return to the Capitol.\n\nIn Illinois, Pritzker hailed House Democrats\u2019 decision to leave the state as a \u201crighteous act of courage.\u201d\n\nIn the following days, leading Illinois lawmakers would join them at press conferences in an effort to draw more attention to redistricting. Other Texas Democrats did the same in Massachusetts and New York.\n\nDemocrats were scrambling to schedule regular news briefings on their efforts. But then on Wednesday morning, a bomb threat derailed their publicity blitz.\n\nThey canceled a news conference with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and began reevaluating their security.\n\nIt was a rude awakening that came after a pro-Trump media outlet exposed their location on social media. Multiple members said the bomb threat evoked the killing of Minnesota lawmaker Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman.\n\nRep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, had traveled to Illinois with her 4-year-old grandson. Howard is his primary caregiver.\n\n\u201cI would have been scared just for my own self,\u201d Howard said. \u201cTo have my grandson here made it especially traumatic, because I would obviously not want to have done anything that would have put him in danger.\u201d\n\nFor the next two days, they remained confined to the Q-Center \u2014 a spartan conference center in St. Charles where representatives slept on twin-sized beds in rooms that reminded some of tiny cruise ship cabins. In Austin, Abbott filed paperwork with the Texas Supreme Court to remove Wu from office. Paxton announced an investigation into how Democrats were paying for their travels.\n\nSen. John Cornyn contacted the FBI, calling on the federal law enforcement agency to track down House Democrats.\n\nThe extent of the FBI\u2019s work is unclear. The agency has declined to comment. Cornyn said agents in San Antonio and Austin were activated to assist state law enforcement.\n\nSome Democrats said the threats only steeled their resolve. Others called it bullying.\n\nGervin-Hawkins, the chair of the House Black Caucus, wondered whether Republicans\u2019 actions might cause permanent damage in a chamber where friendships form across party lines despite stark differences on policy.\n\n\u201cHow can I face colleagues who are now trying to put a target on my back for getting hurt or for getting me arrested, and say that\u2019s OK?\u201d she said.\n\nAt a bricklayers\u2019 union hall in Elmhurst, Ill., on Friday, House Democrats held their first public appearance since the bomb threat and Cornyn\u2019s announcement that the FBI was tracking them.\n\nThe day before, they had secretly moved their operations from the Q-Center to an undisclosed location in the Chicago area.\n\nTheir press event was muted. Its location was only provided to media members who they had verified. At least two Democrats left in the middle of the event. And by its end, lawmakers and their staff outnumbered news media nearly 2-to-1.\n\nHouse Democrats are cognizant that even if they can stop redistricting during this special session, Abbott has the ability to call another session immediately. The governor has said as much and mused that Republicans could seek to flip even more congressional seats if Democrats continue to push back.\n\nTalarico, who is mulling seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2026, said the quorum break has delayed his decision on whether he will jump into the race. When asked about how Democrats would respond to repeated special sessions, he referenced the 2021 quorum break.\n\nDemocrats had fled to Washington to stop a sweeping conservative election bill. When they finally returned, some of Democrats\u2019 most reviled pieces of policy had been stripped from the bill.\n\n\u201cBy shining a national and international spotlight on that voter suppression bill, it pressured Texas Republicans to take the worst parts out,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Vikki Goodwin, an Austin Democrat running for lieutenant governor, said that Democrats have at least slowed down redistricting.\n\n\u201cThe more that people become aware of the situation, the more that will have an impact in the 2026 elections,\u201d Goodwin said.\n\nAt the bricklayers\u2019 union hall, Goodwin watched a livestream of House Democrats\u2019 main event of the day. About 2,000 miles away in Sacramento, Calif., Gov. Gavin Newsom, alongside a handful of Texas Democrats, said his state would redistrict its seats to counteract anything done in Texas.\n\nNewsom was the first of several blue state governors that House Democrats have lobbied to definitively state he would pursue a partisan gerrymander in favor of Democrats. Democratic House members also visited New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nVice President JD Vance headed to Indiana last week to lobby for that state to pursue redistricting. Republicans in Florida have also begun an effort to redraw congressional lines.\n\nTexas Democrats have said redrawing districts in their state would trigger a redistricting arms race. That now appears to be underway.",

      "text": "AUSTIN \u2014 The deadly Hill Country floods, congressional redistricting and the consumable hemp industry are among the top issues for Texas lawmakers when they convene for a special session later this month, according to a proclamation issued Wednesday by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\nThe Republican governor highlighted several areas lawmakers should consider when seeking to address the devastating July 4 flooding along the Guadalupe River, including legislation that would:\n- improve early warning systems and infrastructure in flood zones;\n- beef up emergency communications;\n- provide relief funding for the affected areas, including federal matching dollars;\n- and update or streamline state preparedness and recovery procedures.\n\u201cWe delivered on historic legislation in the 89th Regular Legislative Session that will benefit Texans for generations to come,\u201d Abbott said in the proclamation. \u201cThere is more work to be done, particularly in the aftermath of the devastating floods in the Texas Hill Country. We must ensure better preparation for such events in the future.\u201d\nAbbott included those issues on a list of 18 agenda items that lawmakers are expected to address in the session starting July 21.\nThe list also includes abortion restrictions, limiting transgender rights, throwing out the state\u2019s standardized education tests, increasing the powers of the Texas Attorney General to prosecute state election crimes, banning taxpayer-funded lobbying and further reducing property taxes, among other issues that stymied lawmakers during their regular session earlier this year.\nSeveral state House Republicans immediately cheered Abbott\u2019s proclamation. Rep. Nate Schatzline, R-Fort Worth, called it \u201cBOLD,\u201d while Rep. Caroline Harris Davila, R-Round Rock, said she was \u201cgrateful to [Abbott] for adding these critical priorities to the special session call.\u201d\nSeveral Democrats criticized Abbott for including redistricting in a session they said should be focused on addressing the deadly floods.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting political gamesmanship at a time where every person in our state is reeling over what has happened to the heart of Texas,\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chair Kendall Scudder said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s going to suck all the oxygen out of the room at a time when Texans desperately need leadership. You should never look for leadership in Greg Abbott. He\u2019s a total clown.\u201d\nOnly Abbott can call a special session of the Legislature, and there is no limit to how many he can call in between the biennial regular sessions. Each special session can last up to 30 days.\nThe July 4 floods along the Guadalupe River have killed nearly 120 people, including 27 girls from a beloved summer camp, Camp Mystic, in Hunt. More than 160 remain missing.\nState leaders are already suggesting ways to avoid similar tragedies in the future, with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick leading the charge on state-funded warning sirens and lawmakers taking second looks at past attempts to develop statewide mitigation plans and other ideas.\nEarlier in the day, Abbott ordered flags flown at half-staff in honor of the victims and their families.\nCongressional redistricting\nThe Legislature will also undertake a mid-decade redistricting of congressional seats. It was an effort pushed by the White House, driven by fears that Republicans could lose their slim majority in the House of Representatives in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe White House has pushed for aggressive redistricting in hopes of electing as many as five more Republicans to Congress, according to a New York Times report. Republicans currently hold a 25-to-12 advantage over Democrats among the state Congressional delegation. One seat has remained vacant after the death of Houston Rep. Sylvester Turner. That seat is in a deeply blue district.\nIt will be the first mid-decade redistricting effort since the Texas Legislature redrew Congressional lines in 2003. That effort prompted a walk-out from state Senate Democrats.\nUltimately, it led to Texas Republicans gaining a majority in the state\u2019s congressional delegation for the first time since Reconstruction. The GOP has not relinquished that majority since.\nThe White House did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\nAbbott said in his proclamation that lawmakers should consider an updated plan \u201cin light of constitutional concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d\nThe Justice Department flagged four left-leaning seats in a letter sent to Abbott on Monday, raising concerns over the legality of their racial makeup.\nRedistricting would target Reps. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth; Al Green, D-Houston; Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston; and the vacant Houston seat formerly held by Turner.\nConsumable hemp\nThe call for the special session also includes a directive to lawmakers to take a look at how it can rein in and regulate the state\u2019s burgeoning consumable hemp industry without destroying the $8 billion market boasting some 8,500 retailers and a reported 55,000 employees.\nA ban on all those products \u2014 gummies, vapes, snacks, drinks and smokable flowers \u2014 containing tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive compounding in marijuana, passed the legislature in May.\nIt was vetoed a month later by Abbott, who said the legislation, Senate Bill 3, was unconstitutional and made criminals out of those who turned to the low-THC products when they couldn\u2019t access the state\u2019s medical marijuana program.\nAbbott said lawmakers should not only limit consumable hemp products to customers 21 and up, but also \u201ccomprehensively regulate hemp-derived products, including limiting potency, restricting synthetically modified compounds, and establishing enforcement mechanisms, all without banning a lawful agricultural commodity.\u201d\nState-mandated STAAR test\nAbbott called for legislation that would \u201celiminate the STAAR test and replace it with effective tools to assess student progress and ensure school district accountability.\u201d\nIn May, the Texas House passed a bill that would have replaced the controversial STAAR test with a series of three shorter exams administered throughout the school year. But the Senate passed a version that maintained the state\u2019s authority to administer a replacement test overseen by the Texas Education Agency.\nThe two chambers could not reach an agreement on how to scrap the test by the session\u2019s June 2 deadline.\nThe STAAR test \u2014 which public school students must take in various subjects beginning in the third grade \u2014 has faced years of criticism that it is stressful and unhelpful for educators. The House\u2019s revamped testing schedule would relieve pressure on students and provide teachers with real-time data on how kids are learning, lawmakers said.\nAnnual student testing is required by federal law. Texas\u2019 academic accountability system \u2014 which grades every public school in the state on an A-F rating scale \u2014 is largely based on STAAR scores. Poor results can lead to consequences for school districts, including a state takeover.\nTexas AG powers\nThe special session call includes legislation that would allow Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to prosecute state election crimes. Earlier this year, Paxton urged the Legislature to pass a bill that would restore his authority to prosecute election crimes, a power the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in 2022 he did not have.\nThough opponents insisted a constitutional amendment was necessary to give Paxton such authority, lawmakers pursued a bill to restore his powers. That proposal made it to conference in the final days of the regular session, but lawmakers failed to reach an agreement in time to send the bill to the governor.\nAbortion\nAbbott included a vague call for lawmakers to pass legislation \u201cfurther protecting unborn children and their mothers from the harm of abortion,\u201d a charge that leaves the door wide open to anti-abortion legislation.\nThe Legislature passed two priority abortion bills during the regular session: one clarifying the state\u2019s abortion ban exception to protect the mother\u2019s life and another closing what Republican lawmakers described as a loophole that allowed the cities of Austin and San Antonio to give taxpayer money to abortion assistance groups.\nBut an expansive proposal to ban abortion pill access never made it to Abbott\u2019s desk and will likely be the focus of any related bills during the special session.\nBathroom ban\nThe special session will also tackle legislation that would require people to use certain private spaces \u2014 such as bathrooms \u2014 that align with their sex assigned at birth.\nDuring the regular legislative session, a Senate bill dubbed the Texas Women\u2019s Privacy Act sailed out of the upper chamber but didn\u2019t receive a committee hearing in the House. State Sen. Mayes Middleton, the Galveston Republican who authored the bill, on Wednesday thanked Abbott for including that item on the special session\u2019s agenda.\nTrans Texans and their allies, however, have previously said such legislation would harm the community\u2019s safety and well-being.\nMila Surjadi, Alex Nguyen, Aar\u00f3n Torres and Nolan D.

      "text": "AUSTIN \u2014 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott struck down a proposed statewide ban on gummies, vapes and other consumables containing THC on Sunday, calling the ban unconstitutional and ordering lawmakers into a special session in late July.\nSunday\u2019s late-night decision came just minutes before the midnight deadline for Abbott to veto bills passed during the regular session that ended June 2.\nLegislators now must figure out how to rein in the $8 billion industry without killing its 55,000 jobs, Abbott said in an extensive veto proclamation.\nThe regular session\u2019s bill was \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d he explained, but has legal problems that would keep it in litigation for years, delaying measures that could regulate the industry.\nThe bill opposes federal law and threatens to make felons out of farmers, pharmacists, veterans and parents, Abbott wrote. It could allow for the unconstitutional taking of private property \u2014 namely from the \u201cresponsible\u201d growers, manufacturers and retailers who opened legal businesses and invested millions into the industry that was legal at the time, he said.\n\u201cWe can do better,\u201d Abbott wrote. \u201cTexas must enact a regulatory framework that protects public safety, aligns with federal law, has a fully funded enforcement structure, and can take effect without delay.\u201d\nAbbott, a Republican, stayed quiet for most of his 10 years in office on the issue of medicinal or recreational THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive compound in marijuana.\nAbbott\u2019s long-anticipated veto of Senate Bill 3 \u2014 championed by the Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and law enforcement across Texas \u2014 saved an $8 billion industry with 55,000 employees from being wiped out in six months.\nThe governor said he plans to call a special session of the Legislature to convene on July 21 to address several issues, including criminal justice reforms. He could add more to the session call in the coming weeks.\nAbbott suggested lawmakers consider regulating hemp-based THC in a way similar to the state\u2019s three-tier alcohol system, strictly enforced under an agency such as the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.\nLawmakers should consider enacting \u201copen-container\u201d laws that would prohibit using the product in public or in vehicles as well as age limits, testing requirements and manufacturing restrictions.\nThe decision closes out months of increasingly heated debate and speculation over whether Abbott would let Texas ban THC, whether the industry should be regulated instead of wiped out, and if the genie that was let out of the bottle in a 2019 farm bill could be forced back in with total prohibition.\nIt triggered an instant backlash from Patrick, who pointed out in a statement on X that Abbott stayed \u201ctotally silent\u201d throughout the session on the bill.\n\u201cHis late-night veto, on an issue supported by 105 of 108 Republicans in the legislature, strongly backed by law enforcement, many in the medical and education communities, and the families who have seen their loved ones\u2019 lives destroyed by these very dangerous drugs, leaves them feeling abandoned,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cI feel especially bad for those who testified and poured their hearts out on their tragic losses.\u201d\nHe promised to have \u201cmuch more to say\u201d at a news conference planned for Monday in Austin.\nAbbott\u2019s veto raises the question of what\u2019s next for the 8,500 retailers who have sold the hemp-based products in vape shops, gas stations, coffee shops and brew pubs since they became legal five years ago.\nRaids on legal vape shops continue, with police confiscating inventory they allege contains more THC than the law allows. Customers continue to be at risk for felony charges if they buy a product that is too high in THC unwittingly or police erroneously think their legal hemp product is illegal. The stores must do their own self-policing, with no laws against selling near schools or to minors or marketing to young people.\nIn his veto proclamation Sunday, Abbott acknowledged the industry must be strongly regulated. Texas, unlike other states, does not have age limits, packaging restrictions, or testing or manufacturing requirements.\n\u201cThe current market is dangerously under-regulated, and children are paying the price,\u201d Abbott wrote.\nAllowing the ban to become law, however, would be akin to doing nothing as it gets tied up in courts, he added. If the courts let it happen, he said, it would entrap innocent people.\nAmong SB 3\u2019s biggest legal problems, Abbott wrote in his statement, is that it would rope in cannabis seeds \u2014 sold in stores and used by hemp farmers \u2014 that naturally contain THC, which is in opposition to the 2019 federal bill that legalized them, Abbott explained.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Texas farmer to do? Trust the federal government\u2019s promise, or fear criminal liabilities from the state?\u201d he wrote.\nVeterans using hemp-based THC to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, parents administering it to children for certain types of epilepsy and pharmacists stocking health supplements would all be subjected to criminalization, Abbott said.\n\u201cPassing a law is not the same thing as actually solving a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cTexas needs a bill that is enforceable and will make our communities safer today, rather than years from now. ... I look forward to working with them to ensure that we get it right.\u201d\nIf lawmakers don\u2019t come up with a solution during the special session, the industry, which lobbied for age limits and testing restrictions as an alternative to a full ban, could go another 18 months with no regulatory structure before the next legislative session starts.\nThe ban would have criminalized possession, sale and manufacturing of consumable THC products. The proposal was considered one of the strongest in the nation and was similar to legislation vetoed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, a year ago.\nSupporters of the ban say THC should only be legal in Texas when administered through health professionals for those with medical needs who qualify through the state\u2019s narrow medical marijuana program, known as the Texas Compassionate Use Program.\nThey accuse retailers of carrying products that are often illegally high in THC and selling to minors.\nSome supporters included parents who told lawmakers their children suffered psychosis after consuming synthetic THC products. Police detailed how hard it is to enforce regulations on legal THC. Social conservatives said access to intoxicants should be banned while some doctors said THC shouldn\u2019t be easily accessed.\nOpponents say prohibition would be a disappointing overreach that defies Texas\u2019 pro-business values and stops residents from accessing life-changing products.\nVeterans in particular came out vehemently against the ban, insisting that the state\u2019s recently expanded medical marijuana program doesn\u2019t offer enough options, is not as affordable as hemp-based THC, and doesn\u2019t allow enough of them to qualify for the treatment.\nThe 2019 loophole\nHemp and marijuana plants are varieties of cannabis. In Texas, products containing THC from marijuana are illegal except for the medical program.\nMost THC products derived from hemp plants, however, are legal because of a 2019 state law that allows farming and commercialization of hemp with trace amounts of THC.\nBecause the law was written for farmers, not retailers, it did not offer the restrictions present in other states\u2019 consumable hemp programs, including strict third-party testing requirements and age limits on purchases.\nThe 2019 legislation limited the amount of delta-9 THC in hemp plants and products to no more than 0.3% by weight but did not place limits for any other hemp derivatives.\nThe law removed hemp from the state\u2019s Controlled Substances Act, effectively legalizing all of its derivatives without potency limits on most of them.\nIn 2023, some lawmakers attempted to ban intoxicating hemp-based products but were unsuccessful.\nConsidering alternatives in a special session\nWhen lawmakers return for their special session, they could consider a partial ban or an entirely new regulatory structure.\nAny push to override the veto would take a two-thirds majority of the House and Senate. The ban passed with fewer than 100 votes in the House in May, less than what\u2019s required for an override.\nOne idea that gained some traction in the House during the session would save the state\u2019s consumable hemp market from a total ban while reducing it to edibles and nonsynthetic, smokable low-dose flower buds made with hemp grown only in Texas \u2014 the market that was initially supposed to benefit from the 2019 farm bill.\nUnder the proposal, counties could opt out and through elections go entirely \u201cdry,\u201d with no hemp sales, similar to those allowed for alcohol sales. The entire hemp program would be removed from state health officials\u2019 purview and placed under the direction of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.\nA version of that plan still would have wiped out half of the value of products on the market today, but it stopped short of killing the industry altogether.\nStaff writer Gromer Jeffers Jr. contributed to this report."

      "text": "The Latest: From Illinois, Texas House Democrats say their redistricting fight is a fight for America\nAUSTIN \u2014 Business in the Republican-dominated Texas House screeched to a halt in its third week of a special legislative session Monday when Democrats no-showed a critical vote on a GOP-driven plan to redraw congressional districts to further conservatives\u2019 agenda in Washington.\nThe Texas House sent state troopers to look for them in all corners of the state after House Speaker Dustin Burrows was unable to call a vote on House Bill 4, by Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi.\nA roll call shortly after 3 p.m. revealed that there were only 90 state representatives on the House floor - 10 short of the number legally required to do official business, such as vote on legislation. Those who stayed behind were allowed to leave the chamber while the House stood in recess until 1 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\u201cCome back and fulfill your duty, because this House will not sit quietly while you obstruct the work of the people,\u201d Burrows said in remarks from the House floor.\nBurrows did not reveal the number of representatives who showed up, but thanked them in remarks from the floor and blasted the \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d shown by those who left.\n\u201cLet me begin by commending the members who did show up, those who answered the call, honored their oath and came here ready to work for the people of Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cYour presence speaks volumes. You understand that there are issues before us.\u201d\nHB 4, which the Democrats are bent on killing, would shift five congressional districts in Texas from Democrat to Republican \u2013 a desire of President Donald Trump as he hopes to maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.\nDemocrats say it\u2019s illegal and marginalizes voters of color.\n\u2018We\u2019re happy to go back to the state of Texas this afternoon if the priority is flood relief,\u201d said State Rep. Rafael Anch\u00eda, D-Dallas, speaking to The Dallas Morning News near Chicago. \u201cBut what we don\u2019t want to do is participate in an illegal act of violating the Voting Rights Act.\u201d\nOn motions from Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, and more than a dozen other Republicans, the House voted 86-6 along partisan lines to allow Burrows to sign civil warrants for the Texas Department of Public Safety to start looking for Democrats who may still be in the state.\nFive Democrats were on the House floor at roll call and voted against sending troopers after their colleagues.\nThe DPS has the authority to compel their return to the House under threat of arrest as long as they haven\u2019t crossed state lines.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to work, and I\u2019m very disappointed in my colleagues who are not here to work. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d said Rep. John McQueeny, R-Fort Worth, who is serving his first term in office.\nOther Republicans expressed frustration as well, sending videos from the chamber floor and decrying their decision to flee.\n\u201cI do find it funny that I hear from a lot of those colleagues, \u2018We don\u2019t want to operate like D.C.,\u2019\u201d said Rep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls. \u201cThen why don\u2019t they then stop taking orders from D.C.?\u201d\nHouse Democrats Sunday left for Illinois, gathering at a convention center to make their case against redrawing the lines when there was pressing, unrelated business that needed to be done.\nDuring a Monday appearance on CNN, John Bucy said the quorum break is intended to highlight the issue for people across the country.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a Texas Fight. This is an American fight,\u201d Bucy said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting in Texas, but if this happens, all Americans will suffer and so we must stop it. And we\u2019re asking all Americans to pay attention to what\u2019s happening, to rise up and help us resist Donald Trump right now.\u201d\nThe Democrats, some of whom are also in Boston and Albany, N.Y., are expected to stay away from the Capitol until the special legislative session called by Abbott ends on Aug. 19.\nBack home on Monday, Republican state leaders railed against the Democrats\u2019 political maneuver, which they said would only delay the inevitable passage of the legislation and kill other bills \u2013 including flood relief and property tax reform.\nGov. Greg Abbott continued his public drumbeat, bashing the Democrats for standing in the way of legislation and threatening to call for their removal from office, calling their tactic \u201can abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office.\u201d\nBucy said Democrats weren\u2019t afraid of Abbott or Attorney General Ken Paxton, who could start removal proceedings and has threatened to have the Democrats arrested.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here running into the fight to stand up for our democracy,\u201d Bucy said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ll continue to fight as long as it takes. We are here to kill this special session and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\nAbbott called the special session to deal with a list of 18 items. The bills sitting on the table \u2013 flood relief, a ban on retail THC, and other measures \u2013 could have, in fact, passed easily had they been brought up before the redistricting map bill, which Democrats warned could blow up the session.\nRepublicans chose instead to move the controversial new maps first, in what appears to be a tactic to pressure Democrats into staying for the vote \u2013 or else take the blame for shirking the flood victims of their due relief and canning other popular measures.\nLater on Monday afternoon, about one hundred people showed up to protest outside of the Texas Governor\u2019s Mansion. U.S. Democratic Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett, who both represent Austin, spoke at the rally.\nThe map being considered by the Legislature could force Casar and Doggett to face each other in a Democratic primary for the lone Democratic district in Central Texas.\nNeither Casar or Doggett addressed the potential primary at the protest. Instead, they applauded the Democrats who left the state in protest of the map.\nDoggett also said that the quorum break has resulted in more Americans being aware of the mid-decade redistricting effort in Texas.\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019ve already achieved success in bringing to the attention of the American people that this is even bigger than Texas,\u201d Doggett said.\nOne of the protesters who showed up Monday was Tammy Conrad, 63, a public school teacher.\nEven if the new map ends up passing, despite the quorum break and the protests, Conrad said it\u2019s important to speak out.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up every time someone tries to take our power away, we\u2019re not going to have any power left.\u201d\nPhillip Jankowski and Joseph Morton contributed to this report."

      "text": "AUSTIN \u2014 Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick promised Monday to keep fighting against the retail consumable hemp industry, accusing Gov. Greg Abbott of turning Texas into a recreational marijuana state by vetoing a statewide ban on THC gummies, vapes and other related products.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the state I want,\u201d Patrick, a Republican, said in a news conference at the Capitol. \u201cI don\u2019t want my kids and my grandkids growing up where everybody\u2019s high.\u201d\nAbbott vetoed Senate Bill 3 shortly before a midnight deadline Sunday. The GOP governor directed lawmakers to go into a special session of the Legislature later this summer to craft strict regulations on the $8 billion industry.\nA ban, Abbott wrote in his veto statement, is unconstitutional because it opposes a 2018 federal farm bill that legalized hemp products and authorized the state to pass its own in 2019.\nTexas\u2019 proposed ban would have criminalized sale, manufacture and possession of products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the less potent sister to the marijuana plant, that contain any amount of THC \u2014 products Abbott argued in his veto statement are legal under federal law, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. That includes products made from hemp.\nAbbott announced plans to convene a special session on July 21. He wants legislators to find a way to tax and regulate hemp-derived THC products instead of banning them, potentially through the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission as alcohol is regulated.\nHis decision was a surprise to Patrick, who told reporters that Abbott had told him earlier in the session that the his bill \u201cis fine\u201d and wouldn\u2019t have any problems. He wondered aloud Monday what had changed Abbott\u2019s mind and why the governor hadn\u2019t gotten involved sooner.\nAbbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said in a written statement that the governor and Patrick are still closely aligned on the issue.\nAbbott \u201chas always shared the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s desire to ensure that THC products are not sold to our children and that the dangerous synthetic drugs that we have seen recently are banned,\u201d Mahaleris said. \u201cWe should not risk years of potential legal battles when we can fix the bill and protect kids now.\u201d\nOn Monday, Patrick stopped short of saying he\u2019d kill any bill that wasn\u2019t a ban but warned he would never \u201cgavel down\u201d on allowing the THC market to flourish.\n\u201cThe best way to protect the adults of the children is to ban the product,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot regulate 8,000 to 9,000 locations. We do not have enough law enforcement to do so, and they\u2019ll continue to sell it skirting the law.\u201d\nAbbott called the regular session\u2019s bill \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d but said it has legal problems that would keep it in litigation for years, delaying measures that could regulate an industry he said needed to be reigned in.\nThe bill opposed federal law and threatened to make felons out of farmers, pharmacists, veterans and parents, Abbott wrote. It would have allowed for the unconstitutional taking of private property \u2014 namely from the \u201cresponsible\u201d growers, manufacturers and retailers who opened legal businesses and invested millions into the industry that was legal at the time, he explained.\nRegulation, not prohibition, is what is on Abbott\u2019s agenda for the special session, so sending another ban to the governor\u2019s desk could be difficult, Patrick acknowledged. Patrick conceded that an override was not likely in the cards.\nTexas lawmakers who passed the proposed ban during the regular session, which ended on June 2, said the state\u2019s 8,500 retailers selling the gummies, vapes, drinks and smokable hemp flower are taking advantage of the 2019 state farm bill to set up a market that was never intended by the law.\nLawmakers in the upcoming special session could repeal that bill, Patrick said, or they could send Abbott legislation with so many regulations that it would kill the industry anyway.\nEither would be better than creating a framework for more people to access THC for recreational reasons, he said. Leaving it alone is not an option, he warned.\n\u201cBy this veto, he has now put us in a box where if we do nothing, the status quo continues \u2026 which would be devastating to families,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cOr we have to capitulate and vote for the lesser of two really bad evils.\u201d"

      "text": "AUSTIN \u2014 Democrats used the opening of the first special session of the 89th Texas Legislature on Monday to stress they would use any tactic necessary to stand up to a proposed redrawing of Texas\u2019 congressional district lines to solidify a GOP majority in Washington.\nThat could even include fleeing the state to halt legislative action, known as breaking quorum, a tactic employed by Democrats in 2003 to stop the redrawing of district lines and in 2021 to protest changes in voting laws.\n\u201cThis special session should be focused on rebuilding, not on redistricting,\u201d U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, D-Austin, said at the Texas Capitol. \u201cIf Republicans move forward with this reckless plan, Democrats in the legislature will need to do everything they can to stand up for people\u2019s voting rights and to stand up for people all over this country.\u201d\nState lawmakers convened at noon Monday for the session, ordered by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to address several issues including the Hill Country floods and congressional redistricting, among others.\nPresident Donald Trump is pushing for lawmakers to redraw district lines to flip five U.S. House Democratic seats, including three in Houston and one in Dallas, in hopes of maintaining a Republican majority in next year\u2019s mid-term elections.\nDemocrats in Austin and D.C. warned Monday that forcing them to engage in redistricting now \u2013 when the law requires it only be done every decade \u2013 could derail a session intended to help victims of the July 4 floods and finish business that couldn\u2019t get done earlier in the year.\n\u201cWe will need to buy time,\u201d he said, \u201cand that means keeping everything on the table, doing whatever it takes \u2026 filibusters, dragging out hearings, quorum breaks, the kinds of tactics that will make sure that we have the time to highlight these issues in front of everyday Americans.\u201d\nDemocrats have widely criticized redistricting\u2019s addition to a lengthy special session agenda that includes addressing the recent Hill Country floods, regulating hemp-derived THC and property tax relief.\nThe list of nearly two dozen agenda items also asks legislators to try again on bills that either failed to pass during the regular session earlier this year or didn\u2019t pass muster with the Republican governor once they reached his desk. Lawmakers have already filed at least 150 bills.\n\u201cThere is more work to be done, particularly in the aftermath of the devastating floods in the Texas Hill Country,\u201d Abbott said in a July statement. \u201cWe must ensure better preparation for such events in the future.\u201d\nThe flash flood that ripped through the Guadalupe River area on July 4 has left more than 100 dead in Kerr County.\nLawmakers are also being instructed to reconsider a failed attempt to toss out the STAAR tests required of public school students, abortion issues that will likely include a ban on the abortion pill, taxpayer-funded lobbyists, and issues regarding transgender rights.\nThe session may last up to 30 days. Lawmakers are not required to pass everything, but they risk being called into multiple special sessions if they don\u2019t deliver.\nThe Texas House gaveled out of their opening session on Monday after less than 10 minutes, with much of the action early this week expected to be focused on committee hearings.\nIn the Senate, Democrats showed their first signs of resistance when what was described as a routine resolution to convene a redistricting committee led to two hours of stern questions over the motivations behind the effort to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts.\n\u201cI am angry,\u201d Sen. Roland Gutierrez, D-San Antonio, said. \u201cI think this is a tremendous waste of time. I think it\u2019s a tremendous waste of resources. I think that there are people that have died all throughout this state in a horrible flood, and that\u2019s the only thing that we should be focusing on.\u201d\nSen Phil King, R-Granbury, said that Democrats\u2019 questions would best be answered in committee hearings. King said that they expect to hold at least four hearings, starting Friday. Some could be virtual.\n\u201cToday is not the day to discuss the legalities of a map, how redistricting should be done,\u201d King said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a later time for that. My intent is to look at everything from a race-blind perspective.\u201d\nSome residents carried signs in the Texas Capitol on Monday protesting the redistricting push.\n\u201cThey are only concerned with maximal power,\u201d said 63-year-old Pflugerville resident Jeff Cohen. \u201cThat is un-American and it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s fascism.\u201d\nTexas House Democrats said they will not rule out a quorum break to shut down the effort.\n\u201cDemocrats are going to keep all options open,\u201d said the head of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Gene Wu, D-Houston, during a press conference Monday at the Capitol.\nThe Legislature last redrew district lines in 2021 as part of a regular process that follows the decennial census. The effort was largely viewed as shoring up Republican districts after several Republicans lost seats in the 2018 midterm elections.\nMid-decade redistricting is rare and likely not welcomed by current members of Texas\u2019 GOP delegation in Washington, who could see their solidly red districts watered down as state lawmakers work to build Republican majorities in what are currently heavily Democratic seats.\nThe Department of Justice has pointed toward the Texas seats as illegal because they created large coalitions of non-white voters, according to a letter the governor cited as his reason for including redistricting. Progressive activists say the letter is a thin veil to disguise a power grab."

      "text": "Texas Republicans are taking extraordinary measures to quell a quorum break by House Democrats designed to kill congressional redistricting.\nThe tough approach includes the following:\n- Gov. Greg Abbott is trying to remove and replace the absent Democrats from the Capitol, as well as exploring charging them with bribery, if they accept donations to pay the expenses related to their holdout. On Tuesday he filed an emergency petition with the Texas Supreme Court to remove House Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu of Houston and other Democrats from office.\n- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is investigating Powered by People, the group founded by El Paso Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, over reports that they are raising money to support House Democrats who left the state. Paxton has asked the Texas Supreme Court to vacate the seats of 13 House Democrats who broke quorum. And he asked state judges to declare the seats of absent Democrats vacant if they were not back at the Capitol by Friday.\n- Sen. John Cornyn has pushed the FBI to help round up House Democrats who are not at the Capitol for the special session. On Tuesday, he said FBI officials had granted his request to help \u201clocate\u201d the Democrats. It\u2019s no secret, however, where most of them are. A large group headed to the Chicago area Sunday. Others are in Boston and Albany, N.Y.\nTheir hardball strategies depart from how Republicans approached quorum breaks in 2021 and 2003. While they would have executed civil arrests for quorum breakers caught in Texas, they didn\u2019t seriously try to remove anyone from office or enlist federal authorities to intervene once Democrats were out of the state.\nWhat\u2019s different now?\n\u201cIt comes down to one word, and that\u2019s Trump,\u201d said Vinny Minchillo, a Republican consultant who worked for President Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. \u201cThe president has specifically asked for this and wants to get this done. \u2026 It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\nTrump requested Texas officials redraw its congressional boundaries to help the GOP flip up to five congressional seats now held by Democrats. That would provide Republicans with a cushion going into the 2026 midterm elections.\nHistory shows the party that controls the White House takes losses in midterm elections. Trump wants to avoid that in order to get his agenda completed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the razor-thin margins that we have in Congress right now, plus couple that with the directive from the President of the United States, and you\u2019re seeing the elected office holders who are not wanting to be the ones that are holding this process up,\u201d said Republican political consultant Matthew Langston.\nRedistricting wasn\u2019t a priority for Texas Republicans until Trump asked for it. And since Trump is the unquestioned leader of the Republican Party and is influential in state and local politics, Texas GOP leaders have to push hard to comply with his requests, analysts say.\n\u201cThey cannot afford to have a narrative take hold that a Republican stronghold like Texas is allowing a handful of Democrats to throw a temper tantrum,\u201d Langston said.\nAndrew Mahaleris, a spokesman for Abbott, didn\u2019t address the Trump dynamic. He said, \u201cDemocrats have pulled this stunt one too many times.\u201d\n\u201cNo more. It is inexcusable to flee the state to avoid the work of the people and hide from debating tough issues, much less delay critical relief to Texans devastated by recent floods, wasting time and taxpayer money in the process,\u201d Mahaleris said in a statement. \u201cDemocrats left because they know they are losing the argument. They must return immediately and get back to work.\u201d\nDemocrats say Abbott and other Republicans are controlled by Trump and no longer have the Texas pride that allows for independent thought.\n\u201cThere are his private dancers,\u201d said Democratic Party Chairman Kendall Scudder. \u201cGreg Abbott and Ken Paxton will do anything for their East Coast sugar daddy and New York huckster Donald Trump. It\u2019s a really sad display.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke, the former congressman in Paxton\u2019s crosshairs, said he wasn\u2019t worried about the attorney general\u2019s investigation. He said Trump, Abbott, Paxton and Cornyn were worried about the Democrats staying away from the Capitol. His group has countersued Paxton.\n\u201cThese guys are in full panic mode right now,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cIf Democrats win the U.S. House majority, we will actually have free and fair elections going forward, so everything is on the line for Trump and he\u2019s really tightening the screws on Paxton, Abbott, Cornyn and on the Republican legislators in Texas.\u201d\nState Rep. Chris Turner of Grand Prairie, one of the Democratic lawmakers named in Paxton\u2019s lawsuit, said Paxton is a \u201cterrible attorney general\u201d who is \u201csomewhat good at sending press releases masquerading as court filings.\n\u201cIn breaking quorum in this special session, I am exercising my legislative rights under the Texas Constitution,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cI am doing the very job the people of House District 101 elected me to do--to fight for them and for the voting rights of all Texans.\u201d\nPaxton and Cornyn did not comment for this story. A Paxton campaign spokesperson pointed to his numerous comments on the issue to illustrate his stand against Democrats.\nThe national political scene is different than in 2021, when Democrat Joe Biden was in the White House. It would have been unlikely that the FBI would comply with Republican requests for assistance in rounding up quorum breakers.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Democrats have broken quorum\nIn 2021, Abbott called two special sessions to get an election bill passed, and another for redistricting. Concern that sweeping changes in Texas election law were discriminatory led Democrats to break quorum that time, and they eventually gave up the strategy and returned to the House floor to fight the losing battle.\nThose bills were a reaction to the 2020 elections, where the results in Texas were accepted by Texas Republicans as accurate and fair. Trump argued his loss to Biden was a result of a rigged election, and Legislatures across the country followed up with election law changes that rolled back COVID-era policies that made it easier and more convenient to vote, while toughening provisions to make it harder to commit fraud.\nCornyn did address the 2021 quorum break from the Senate floor. Democrats left Texas for Washington, D.C., as the coronavirus pandemic was still raging.\n\u201cThey will eventually go home after the cameras leave and after the press loses interest in this political stunt. It\u2019s telling that these Democrats and this House of Representatives chose to race toward TV cameras in Washington rather than present their arguments in the Legislature,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\u201cAs Texans, standing up to a fight is part of who we are even if you know in the end you may not prevail. But, instead, they turned their backs, hopped on a private jet, and ran from this fight.\u201d\nWhile COVID and the Biden administration may have prevented Republicans from asking the federal government to intervene, there wasn\u2019t the same sense of urgency for Texas law enforcement to get heavily involved.\nIn 2003, there were early efforts to find the fleeing House Democrats, including then House Speaker Tom Craddick asking then U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, to enlist the Federal Aviation Administration to track a plane believed to be carrying some Democrats. Craddick also asked DeLay to see if the Justice Department could help bring Democrats back to Texas from Ardmore, Okla.\nLater, in a special session, Democratic senators who broke quorum and camped out in an Albuquerque Marriott had their heads on swivels, just in case a Texas law enforcement officer showed up. But that never happened.\nIt wasn\u2019t necessary.\nDemocrats have never staged a quorum break that successfully stopped a Republican bill from being passed. The most effective tactic: Keep calling special sessions.\nThe Trump factor\nTrump has said he \u201cdeserves\u201d five more Republican congressional seats from Texas.\nAbbott has acknowledged that he frequently talks to Trump, but didn\u2019t divulge the details of their conversations about redistricting.\nThe recent federal, state, local and judicial efforts to move the process forward seemed coordinated.\nAbbott added redistricting to a special session agenda after the Department of Justice sent a letter to Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stating that four districts, including Fort Worth Democrat Marc Veasey\u2019s, violate the law because they were drawn with illegal non-white coalitions.\nRepublicans, including Paxton, have said publicly and in court documents that the districts did not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nAfter the quorum break, Abbott said on Fox News that population growth made it necessary to redraw congressional boundaries, pointing out the Republican successes in the Rio Grande Valley needed to be reflected in the new boundaries.\nTexas Republicans moved forward with redistricting, however, holding several field hearings to get public input, including one last month in Arlington. The hearings were held without the proposed maps or bill.\nAfter the hearings, House Bill 4, authored by Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, was unveiled. It would shift five congressional districts to Republicans\u2019 favor, and help Trump\u2019s effort to maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe bill was set for a Monday vote, but Democrats left the state to prevent the House from having a quorum.\nIf the bill isn\u2019t passed before the special session expires on Aug. 19, it dies \u2014 for now. Abbott is widely expected to call another special session if needed.\nUntil then, Republicans are fighting hard to get Democrats in place for a vote.\n\u201cThe Republicans are going to look at it from the standpoint of we will not be strong-armed and held hostage by a handful of Democrats that are not even in the state,\u201d said Langston, the political consultant. \u201cThere will be consequences. I don\u2019t think any of the Republicans are playing around.\u201d\nLangston said Abbott is coming off a 2024 primary election cycle where he successfully campaigned to oust eight incumbent Democrats, who, the previous year, voted to block his school choice plan.\n\u201cGov. Abbott is saying, \u2018don\u2019t call my bluff on this, because I\u2019m not bluffing,\u2019\u201d Langston added. \u201cHe\u2019s not a governor I would mess with right now.\u201d\nHigh stakes for Cornyn, Paxton\nThe stepped-up activity from Paxton and Cornyn has additional intrigue.\nPaxton is challenging Cornyn in next year\u2019s Senate primary. Both would love to have Trump\u2019s endorsement.\nThe winner of the GOP primary could also benefit from increased political activity in the March primaries and November general elections. If the Republican-driven maps are approved, there will be competitive Senate primaries to determine nominees. Since the races in the Rio Grande Valley will be competitive, even with the new maps, the 2026 elections will have down-ballot candidates powering the overall election turnout.\n\u201cIt has significant implications on their [Cornyn and Paxton] races to have potentially five open seats where millions of dollars will be spent,\u201d Langston said. \u201cThere will be a significant churn within the electorate that is going to have a direct impact on their races. Usually, it\u2019s top down. In this situation, at least in those areas, the congressional races will drive more people out to the polls.\u201d\nEnd game?\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the quorum break will be resolved.\nThe legal strategies by Abbott and Paxton could be long shots. It\u2019s also unclear if Democrats can actually get arrested outside of Texas.\nMinchillo points out that even though the Texas Supreme Court has ruled in favor of quorum breakers in the past, the all-Republican body could feel pressure to deliver for Trump.\n\u201cRemember, the Texas Supreme Court is also an elected position,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could be at risk.\u201d\nA negotiated settlement is also unlikely, Minchillo said.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know that Abbott\u2019s in a negotiating mood,\u201d Minchillo said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s sooner or later, he\u2019s going to figure out a way to get his way on this.\u201d\nOne Democrat said, \u201cRepublican extremists don\u2019t want a fair fight.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a saying that \u2018desperate times call for desperate measures\u2019 and Gov. Abbott, Sen. John Cornyn, and AG Ken Paxton (all on our 2026 ballot) are beyond desperate to keep political power,\u201d said Kathleen Thompson, executive director of the liberal group Progress Texas. \u201cThey know they will lose in 2026 if they don\u2019t follow marching orders from the president to rig the election now.\u201d\nScudder said Democrats were not backing down amid Abbott\u2019s threats.\n\u201cDemocrats are going to be playing by the same rulebook that Republicans have,\u201d Scudder said. \u201cNow it\u2019s Greg Abbott\u2019s job to figure out how to mediate this mess, how to negotiate himself into a situation where the government that he controls can be functional.\u201d\nWhen asked about the end game, Scudder redirected the question to Abbott.\n\u201cThe end game of this is that Donald Trump will take political gerrymandering off of a special session calendar so that we can do the work of the people and get flood relief for the people who need it,\u201d he said.\nDave Carney, Abbott\u2019s political strategist, predicted on its onset that the quorum break would not work.\n\u201cThey know ultimately they will be back,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to sit there and fight, not just walk away.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke said this time is different.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real urgency on both sides,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThese 56 people are all that remains between where we are now and the concentration of authoritarian power in the hands of Trump. That\u2019s why I see these guys in full panic mode.\u201d\nNo matter what happens between now and the end of the special session, the impact of the Texas redistricting saga could play out through 2026 and beyond."

      "text": "AUSTIN \u2014 Ken Paxton is asking that California law enforcement officers be allowed to arrest Texas House Democrats who are staying in the state, according to a lawsuit the attorney general filed Friday.\nIt\u2019s the second time this week Paxton has petitioned a state to allow civil arrest warrants issued by the Texas House to be enforced outside of state lines. Paxton filed a similar lawsuit on Thursday in Illinois state court against 33 House Democrats, who have been staying near Chicago as they attempt to stop a congressional map from passing.\n\u201cTexans are fed up with lawmakers who refuse to do their jobs and instead run away to states like California to exploit radical governors\u2019 broken political systems as a shield,\u201d Paxton said in a statement Saturday announcing the lawsuit.\nThe Texas House has been at a standstill since Monday after more than 50 Democrats fled the state in protest of a new congressional map that would shift five districts to the GOP\u2019s favor.\nThe petition naming six House Democratic lawmakers argues that California must honor Texas\u2019 legal acts and judicial outcomes under the \u201cfull faith and credit clause\u201d in the U.S. Constitution.\nPaxton filed his lawsuit in Tehama County, a Northern California county more than 100 miles from Sacramento. Tehama County supported President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, with the president gaining 64% of the vote while then-Vice President Kamala Harris received 33%.\nHarris carried California with 59% of the vote, suggesting Paxton likely filed the petition in a county that might be more receptive to the Republican attorney general\u2019s argument. Paxton filed his lawsuit in Illinois in a county that supported Trump \u2013 Adams County. Illinois supported Harris in the presidential election.\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, said Friday that more lawsuits like the one filed in Illinois were on the horizon. Republican officials in Texas have been intensifying the pressure in their efforts to bring Democratic lawmakers back to the House.\nBurrows said he and Paxton will continue their efforts to bring lawmakers back to Texas.\n\u201cAll members will eventually have to come back, but the business before the House is too important to wait on the outside political influences pushing these members to delay the inevitable,\u201d Burrows said in a statement Saturday.\nIn addition to the daily fines and civil arrest warrants Democrats are facing, Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott have both asked the Texas Supreme Court to expel some of the Democratic members from the Texas House for breaking quorum.\n\u201cWe are running from nothing,\u201d Rep. Ann Johnson, D-Houston, said Friday at a news conference in California. Johnson was among the six named in Paxton\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cWe are here to give hope to others, to stand up and be courageous in this moment.\u201d\nThe redistricting fight has drawn national attention and could lead to an all-out redistricting battle between the states. House Democrats were in California as state lawmakers there rushed to schedule a special election to rework their congressional maps that will serve as a counter to Texas\u2019 congressional maps.\nWithin Texas, the congressional redistricting effort has shown to be unpopular. Legislative hearings on the maps have drawn far more people who oppose the maps and the mid-decade redistricting task amid a special session that asks lawmakers to pass legislation in response to the deadly Hill Country floods.\nRepublicans\u2019 redistricting plan also sparked protests in Dallas on Saturday, with about 100 people gathering in Dealey Plaza to protest the proposed redistricting maps and support the Democrats who left the state.\nProtestors, interspersed with tour groups, held signs that said \u201cDon\u2019t tread on Texas Voters\u201d and \u201cNo new maps.\u201d Cars driving through the plaza honked in support.\nThe protest was organized by Indivisible Dallas, which encouraged attendees to register to vote and had tables with information about the redistricting push and gerrymandering. After about 45 minutes, the group marched down Commerce Street to the federal courthouse, then back to Dealey Plaza.\nMindy Miller, 66, was at Saturday\u2019s protest in support of Texas Democrats. The Dallas local said that the fight over redistricting is \u201cfundamental\u201d to democracy.\n\u201cOur voice is being diluted,\u201d she said. \u201cMy vote doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re constantly gerrymandering.\u201d\nJamie Bruner, 55, came to the protest with her neighbor Mary Cato, 76. The two live in Arlington and said they previously attended a hearing at the University of Texas at Arlington, where the redistricting of the Tarrant County commissioners court districts was discussed.\nBruner said redistricting is \u201ccheating\u201d and said it was scary to see how fast the redrawn maps evolved from Tarrant County to the whole state of Texas.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping enough people can stand up and let their voices be heard that they realize that even if they do cheat, we\u2019re still gonna fight,\u201d she said."

      "text": "Dallas political consultant Kendall Scudder on Saturday was elected chairman of the Texas Democratic Party and immediately promised to build an organization that would make the \u201cTexas working men and women proud.\u201d\nScudder replaces former Cameron County Judge Gilberto Hinojosa, who announced his resignation in November after disappointing losses in the 2024 election. Hinojosa led the party for 12 years.\nSince then, party leaders, activists and elected officials have been pondering strategies to start winning statewide elections and protecting Democratic strongholds. Republicans have dominated Texas politics since 2003, when they took control of the entire Legislature and every statewide office. Democrats haven\u2019t won a statewide contest since 1994.\nThough chairpersons of Texas political parties don\u2019t have the clout of their counterparts in other states, they play a role in messaging, grassroots activity and fundraising to boost candidates up and down the ballot.\n\u201cA lot of people are counting on us to come together and do the right thing and make sure that we\u2019re building a Texas Democratic Party that is worthy of the grassroots in this state,\u201d Scudder said after winning an election held by 121 members of the party\u2019s executive committee. \u201cI know that you\u2019re up for the task\u2026and I can\u2019t wait to work with every one of you to build this Texas Democratic Party that we deserve.\u201d\nDemocrats agree they need someone to pull together the sometimes disparate factions of the party in order to win elections.\nScudder said he would work toward that goal.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made commitments that we\u2019re all going to be working together regardless of outcome,\u201d Scudder said.\nIt was an easy win for Scudder, who resigned his post on the Dallas Central Appraisal District before the election. He got 65 of 121 votes in the eight-candidate field. Former Annie List\u2019s executive director Patsy Woods Martin was second with 27 votes and Houston consultant Lillie Schechter was third with 26.\nScudder will fill the remainder of Hinojosa\u2019s term, which ends in 2026."

      "text": "Voting Rights Act doesn\u2019t protect coalitions of racial or ethnic groups challenging political maps, appeals court rules\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nCoalitions of minority groups cannot band together to claim that political maps constitute discriminatory gerrymandering, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a Galveston County lawsuit.\nThe 12-6 decision found that the Voting Rights Act\u2019s protections for individual racial or ethnic groups do not extend to multiple groups joining together to claim that political boundaries dilute their votes. The ruling came in a case in which Black and Latino voters jointly sued Galveston County for voter discrimination after the county dismantled a district where people of color made up the majority.\nThe ruling Thursday reversed a 1988 5th Circuit opinion that found there was nothing that expressly prohibited such coalition claims in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. That decades-old ruling stemmed from a lawsuit alleging that an at-large election system \u2014 where all voters elect representatives who serve the entire area, rather than specific geographic districts within it \u2014 diluted the votes of a coalition of Black and Hispanic voters.\nThe court wrote in its new ruling that the Voting Rights Act does not explicitly permit coalition, therefore they have no legal standing.\n\u201cNowhere does Section 2 indicate that two minority groups may combine forces to pursue a vote dilution claim,\u201d Judge Edith H. Jones wrote for the majority. \u201cOn the contrary, the statute identifies the subject of a vote dilution claim as \u2018a class,\u2019 in the singular, not the plural.\u201d\nThe ruling only applies to Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi \u2014 the states where the court has jurisdiction. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit is known for its ideologically conservative rulings, often pushing legal interpretation to the right. The U.S. Supreme Court has overturned many of its recent rulings. The plaintiffs have not yet announced if they plan on appealing to the Supreme Court.\nThe new opinion will hinder minority groups from challenging electoral maps, said Nickolas Spencer, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs.\n\u201cThe Fifth Circuit decision reverses its own precedent in order to make it more difficult for diverse communities to exercise their right to vote,\u201d Spencer said in a statement. \u201cThe Court tells Black and Hispanic Americans that their shared harm cannot be [adjudicated] together. In practice this means it often can't be [adjudicated] at all.\u201d\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nWhile the majority claims that this \u201cdecision will in no way imperil\u201d the success of the Voting Rights Act, six judges remained unsure.\n\"To imply, as the majority does, that discrimination is permissible so long as the victims of the discrimination are racially diverse, is not only an absurd conclusion but it is one with grave consequences,\" Judge Dana M. Douglas wrote in her dissent.\nThe original case was brought by residents of Galveston County joined by the U.S. Department of Justice, three branches of the NAACP, and a branch of the League of United Latin American Citizens. While this decision kills the plaintiffs Section 2 arguments, the lawsuit included two other pathways for litigation that will now be sent back to district court to be resolved.\nRedistricting sparked the case. Galveston County commissioners split up Precinct 3, which previously allowed Black and Latino residents to form political coalitions and elect their preferred representatives. After the 2020 census, the precinct, which included diverse areas with a significant Black population, was redrawn into a smaller district in the predominantly white northwestern part of the county. This change ensured that white voters now make up at least 62% of the electorate in each of the four precincts, effectively diluting the electoral power of Black and Latino communities.\nLast October, a federal judge ruled that Galveston County\u2019s redistricting maps violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 which prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group \u2014 by diluting the voting power of Black and Latino residents.\nA month later, a three-judge panel from the 5th Circuit agreed but questioned the precedent that allowed minority coalitions to sue, requesting the full court to review the issue.\nThe new ruling said that allowing coalitions of different racial or ethnic groups to make vote-dilution claims would complicate drawing redistricting maps and inundate courts with cases that are difficult to litigate.\nHistorically this has been untrue, according to Sarah Xiyi Chen, an attorney litigating the case with the Texas Civil Rights Project. She says that coalition claims are rare because it's difficult to prove that different groups share interests and are jointly discriminated against, making the majority's argument less reflective of the actual context and challenges in Voting Rights Act cases.\nVoting rights advocates said it was unjust for the appeals court to overturn its own precedent.\n\u201cThe Fifth Circuit reversed decades of settled law to deny relief to Black and Latino voters seeking nothing more than equal voting power and a voice in their local government,\u201d said Hilary Harris Klein, an attorney for Southern Coalition for Social Justice who represented the voters who sued. \u201cPlaintiffs proved their case at trial, and in response, the appellate court moved the goalpost.\u201d\nThe full program is now LIVE for the 2024 Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 5\u20137 in downtown Austin.

      "text": "ARLINGTON \u2014 In a public hearing that oftentimes resembled a political rally, residents from across North Texas on Monday voiced their discontent with the Republican-led effort to redraw Texas\u2019 congressional districts.\nA crowd of more than 450 packed the Rosebud at the University of Texas at Arlington while hundreds more waited outside. The crowd cheered and clapped, booed and shouted \u201cAmen\u201d when prompted as lawmakers heard near-universal opposition to the redistricting.\n\u201cThis is wrong, you know it\u2019s wrong. In your heart, you know it\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Samuel Garcia of Abilene.\nPresident Donald Trump has called on Texas lawmakers to redraw congressional districts in hopes of flipping as many as five districts from Democratic control to Republican, an effort to protect a thin GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives during the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.\nGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.\nGov. Greg Abbott placed redistricting on the agenda for a special session of the Legislature. While the state\u2019s response to the Hill Country floods was named as the top priority for lawmakers\u2019 limited 30-day session, redistricting has come to dominate the political conversation.\nAbbott relied on a July 7 letter from the Justice Department as justification for placing redistricting on the agenda. Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate are hoping to hear from the Justice Department attorney who drafted the letter, though House redistricting committee chairman state Rep. Cody Vasut, R-Angleton, said he has yet to get in touch with the lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon.\n\u201cI have not received a formal response,\u201d Vasut said. \u201cI received an out-of-office notification.\u201d\nLawmakers on the Senate\u2019s redistricting committee continued to mull whether to subpoena Dhillon. The Senate\u2019s redistricting committee also met Monday in Austin to hear virtual testimony on redistricting.\nDhillon\u2019s letter targeted four districts \u2014 three in Houston and one in North Texas \u2014 that are illegal because they are composed of a coalition of nonwhite people that make up a majority of their populations. There have been concerns that Dhillon\u2019s reasoning incorrectly interprets a court ruling related to a recent Galveston redistricting lawsuit.\nThe Justice Department has refused to comment on those concerns.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth district targeted by the Justice Department snakes through Dallas and Tarrant counties, creating a district in which roughly 87% of residents are people of color, according to state records.\nIt is represented by U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth. Veasey was joined by U.S. Reps. Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch, and Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston, who addressed the House committee Monday in Arlington.\n\u201cTrump has drawn a line in the sand, and it\u2019s time for everybody that believes that what he is doing is wrong to stand up and fight and speak out against this redistricting,\u201d Veasey said at a rally before the hearing.\nSince late last week, House lawmakers have heard a chorus of input against the redistricting effort. Lawmakers have been criticized for holding the hearings before any official congressional maps have been presented and labeled eager sycophants for Trump.\n\u201cYou\u2019re shameless, power-hungry bootlickers for Trump,\u201d Fort Worth resident Mendi Tackett told the committee.\nAt Monday\u2019s rally, Tarrant County Commissioner Alisa Simmons, whose county commission precinct was redrawn by the commission\u2019s Republican majority in June over her objections, said Tarrant County was Republicans\u2019 \u201cproving ground\u201d for congressional redistricting.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see all of you here, right here, in the newly redistricted Precinct 2,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThey jacked with my \u2026 seat, OK, and I\u2019m not happy about it.\u201d\nHouse lawmakers did hear what appeared to be the first person to testify in favor of the redistricting plans Monday. That input came from Rich Stoglin, president of the Frederick Douglass Republicans of Tarrant County.\n\u201cAs a Black American, Afghanistan veteran, a retired department head of the U.S. Department of Justice, I strongly support the Republican redistricting,\u201d Stoglin said over a cascade of boos.\nPhilip Jankowski has covered government, politics and criminal justice in Texas for 17 years.

      "text": "INGRAM \u2014 It was the dead of early morning July 4 when Patrick O\u2019Malley\u2019s house was lifted off the ground and carried 200 feet by the raging Guadalupe River in a remote stretch of the Texas Hill Country.\n\u201cThe water was just moving so fast,\u201d he recalled on Saturday at an event in Ingram. \u201cI thought three times about jumping out, but there was just no way. I mean, it had just moved my house, you know? I weigh 145. I\u2019m not heavier than a house.\u201d\nAt least 137 people, including 27 children and counselors at Camp Mystic, died when flash floodwaters raged through communities along the river, through storied towns filled with campers and tourists and homes that have been in families for generations.\nMore than 100 of the flood\u2019s hardest hit residents, including O\u2019Malley, saw some welcome relief on Saturday when they received their first in what was promised to be a series relief checks from the Vaqueros del Mar, a 15-year-old charity run by country music superstar George Strait \u2013 a native of tiny Poteet \u2013 and his business partner, Tom Cusick.\n\u201cThis is the most tragic devastation that I\u2019ve ever seen in Texas, just when you think about the loss of life alone. It\u2019s beyond heartbreaking \u2013 truly incomprehensible,\u201d said Gov. Greg Abbott, who met with flood survivors as the checks were being handed out. \u201cWe know that in addition to the loss of life, there are so many people like yourselves who are struggling, trying to put their lives back together, dealing with challenges they\u2019ve never experienced before.\u201d\nAbbott was joined by Cusick and Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd at the private event at Ingram Middle School.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a God thing,\u201d said a grateful Anita Vanklaberen, O\u2019Malley\u2019s mother. \u201cI\u2019ve asked myself so many times, \u2018How am I going to help him? How can I help him?\u2019 This is a blessing.\u201d\nOn the night of the floods, O\u2019Malley, 33, waited alone in his home between Ingram and Hunt \u2013 among the areas hardest hit by the deadly Guadalupe River floods \u2013 until the sun came up. Then he and his neighbors spent the rest of the morning wading through waist-high waters, floating the street\u2019s stranded children on someone\u2019s boat, to safety on the other side of the road.\nNow his house can\u2019t be covered by insurance because his policy didn\u2019t cover floods, and he\u2019s still waiting to find out if he qualifies for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nThe private donations will help the construction worker and handyman get back on his feet, O\u2019Malley said \u2013 a sentiment echoed by other victims who were receiving funds.\nAmong the recipients were Dusty Gilliam, whose daughter, Camp Heart of the Hills director Jane Ragsdale, died in the floods. They also included Bear Aspra, whose house was destroyed when the bluff behind it buckled during the rains, and a small boulder rammed through his children\u2019s bedroom.\nThe four children, ages 2 through 11, were thankfully at their grandparents\u2019 house in nearby Kerrville when the water came up to the steps around 3:30 a.m.\n\u201cWe just waited until daylight,\u201d Aspra, 39, said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have electricity. We just waited it out. No cell reception, so you can\u2019t call. We were blocked in from the river that was still coming up. Then the sun came up, and it started receding.\u201d\nThe home has been called a total loss, but it\u2019s been in Aspra\u2019s family for three generations and counting. Clara Aspra, Bear\u2019s wife, is expecting her fifth child \u2013 happy news they\u2019d gotten about 12 hours before the walls literally caved in.\nStrait\u2019s foundation organized the concert in the first 10 days after the floods, Cusick told the crowd gathered in the auditorium at the middle school. That intimate private benefit dinner and concert, \u201cStrait to the Heart,\u201d took place on July 27 in the exclusive Estancia at Thunder Valley community in Boerne, raising $7 million from donors who purchased tickets at prices starting at $1,000. Local first responders were invited at no cost. The event also collected donations at the door and online.\nStrait was joined at the benefit concert by a host of fellow singer-songwriters, including Ray Benson, Wade Bowen, Riley Green, Randy Houser, Kyle Park, Hudson Westbrook and members of Strait\u2019s own Ace in the Hole band.\n\u201cThe destruction and loss in our community from the recent flood is hard to wrap your head around,\u201d Strait said in a statement promoting the concert. \u201cOur hearts and prayers are with you all. The goal with this event is to raise meaningful, immediate support that can be put directly into the hands of flood victims without delay, while also honoring the first responders that work tirelessly to save lives.\u201d\nThe first person at the check tables after the official remarks Saturday was Elijah Hoisington, whose trailer at Riverside RV Park in Old Ingram was flooded by the rains.\nHoisington recalls being awakened at 4 a.m. by pounding at the door by members of the Ingram Volunteer Fire Department.\n\u201cI opened the door and they said, \u2018You need to evacuate. Now,\u2019\u201d Hoisington recalled.\nThe water was rising visibly, inches every second, it seemed, he said. They were able to get the car out just as the river was seeping into their home.\nNow he and his wife are staying at a nearby inn for $500 a week, which is fast depleting the cash they got from FEMA, while they figure out their next move. At 55 and disabled, his retirement is enough to either live on or rebuild \u2013 but not both.\n\u201cThis will help us with our living expenses, which is what we really need the most,\u201d Hoisington said. \u201cThey\u2019re calling our trailer a total loss.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Texas House Democrats have fled the state to block a GOP-led redistricting effort that could shift five congressional seats from Democratic to Republican control, a move prompted by pressure from former President Trump. The Democrats' quorum break has led to threats of arrest and legal action from Texas Republicans, including Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, who are seeking to compel their return. Amidst this political turmoil, the state is also grappling with the aftermath of devastating floods that have claimed numerous lives, further complicating the legislative agenda.",
