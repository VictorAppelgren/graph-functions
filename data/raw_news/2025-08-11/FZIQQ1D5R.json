  "title": "What's the Better Buy, Casabrews' $140 Espresso Machine or the $300 Breville Bambino?",
  "description": "Breville's compact machine is popular with espresso lovers with cramped kitchens, but Casabrews offers a similarly small model for half the price. I tested both to see which is the better buy in 2025.",
  "content": "More people are experimenting with making coffee at home, leading to the rise in popularity of compact espresso machines like the Breville Bambino and Casabrews CM5418. In 2025, Casabrews produced a similar compact model for about half the price of the Breville Bambino. So how does this budget machine compare to the popular, pricier Bambino?\n\nI tested the Casabrews 5418 and Bambino Breville to compare functionality, consistency, value and ease of use. In the past couple of months, including through a move and tasting several coffee subscriptions, I experienced the quirks and benefits of each of the entry-level espresso machines. As a former barista with training on commercial machines, I evaluated the pros and cons of each, pitting functionality, value, and ease of use against one another, and all through the lens of a beginner. I'll share whether the Bambino is worth the price difference or if Casabrews unseated the household brand.\n\nOverview of the Breville Bambino and Casabrews CM5418\n\nBreville is a household name in no small part because of its home espresso machines, including its entry-level, semi-automatic Breville Bambino. The Bambino launched in 2020, now retailing at about $300, as a more value-driven model to its slightly more robust Breville Bambino Plus. The same year, the Casabrews brand launched as a rival espresso machine producer aimed at affordability. The Casabrews CM5418 debuted in the spring of 2025 at a mere $140. Despite the model's recent release (and robotic name), Casabrews says its CM5418 is already one of the three highest-selling semi-automatic coffee machines on Amazon.\n\nAt first glance, both models are semiautomatic espresso machines with steam wand capabilities. Each is designed as a lightweight and compact option so you won't have to compete for counter space. Detractors often note the flimsy feel because of the combination of thin stainless steel and plastic components. While I appreciate the space-saving designs, I also found it much too easy to tip over either machine if I pulled the portafilter in place with even moderate force. The machines themselves seem well-made and the ability to tuck away an espresso machine is an advantage. Frustratingly, both models include portafilters in non-standard sizes, which means tools like a tamper and a dosing funnel aren't interchangeable with each other or many other models.\n\nDigging in deeper, the two espresso machines have some stark differences so I'll break down their features because some nuances affected my testing experience.\n\nI'll start by saying the Breville Bambino is a surprisingly robust little kit. The Breville espresso machine comes with 1-cup and 2-cup dual-wall filter baskets, plus, unlike its competitor, single-wall filter baskets and a metal milk jug. The size of the espresso machine is two inches wider than the Casabrews, but the difference wasn't an issue in terms of saving space on the counter. Dosing for the 54-millimeter portafilter is a recommended 16 to 18 grams of coffee.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of the Bambino is the three-second \"ThermoJet\" heating system with PID, a digital thermostat that controls the temperature of the water for more stability. (Large swings in temperature will affect the flavor of a shot.) The ThermoJet innovation is more than a marketing gimmick: a glass and ceramic enamel coat the stainless steel to heat faster, resulting in an impressively short wait time before you can steam milk or pull a piping hot espresso shot. In comparison, one of the biggest downsides of the Casabrews CM5418 is the temperamental heating system, but more on that in the testing section.\n\nBreville also found a sweet spot with the nine bars of extraction pressure, similar to most commercial machines. Additional benefits of the Breville Bambino include that the milk frother has a 180-degree rotation that allows for more comfortable use. I kept reaching for the Bambino to steam milk even for drip coffee. I recommend replacing the included plastic tamper as soon as possible but the included milk jug is much appreciated.\n\nThe most obvious difference between the Casabrews CM5418 and Breville Bambino isn't just a lower price but its slightly smaller size. The CM5418 features a 51-millimeter portafilter with room for a recommended 13 to 15 grams of coffee and a slimmer profile at 5.47 inches. The Casabrews also comes in seven colors, a bonus for anyone interested in a less conventional appliance on the counter. (I tested the stainless steel iteration, which I found attractive.) I found the manual instructions to be clear and two large stickers give additional directions, including one on top and another on the side that is so sticky it appears that it's meant to stay on the machine permanently.\n\nThe Casabrews kit is pared down to include 1-cup and 2-cup double-wall filter baskets and a combination scoop and tamper tool. I hesitate to even call the tool a tamper as it's a thin plastic spoon with a flat circular end rather than the traditional form or weight. The double-wall filters are in some ways a cheat code because they build additional pressure to manufacture a thicker crema. Similar to a Nespresso or L'Or pod machine, this crema is considered artificial by serious coffee folks because it's not as rich but will likely be a big bonus for many drinkers. The 20 bars of extraction pressure also point to the expectation that the coffee will be coarser because most at-home grinders can't deliver a fine espresso grind. Casabrews 5148 also includes a PID for water temperature regulation and consistency.\n\nEditor's note: CNET contributor Pamela Vachon previously tested this Casabrews model and gave it high marks.\n\nI tested the Casabrews CM5418 and Breville Bambino in my home over a couple of months for real-life comparisons. I used the popular Barazta Encore ESP grinder on different types of espresso, including an organic medium roast espresso blend from Wonderstate Coffee to see what nuances would translate, and a darker roast Honduran espresso blend from Atlas Coffee. I compared key functions for an entry-level espresso machine, including the milk wand and over-pressure valve that regulates water pressure for optimal extraction, as well as the overall value of each kit. The entry-level espresso machines are also made with novice users in mind, so a significant portion of testing included how easy it was to use each machine. I evaluated the functionality, features and consistency to compare the overall value of the machines, even if that is a more subjective takeaway.\n\nComparison out of the box\n\nThe Breville Bambino and Casabrew CM5418 espresso machines are quite similar in appearance, build and weight. The tampers leave a lot to be desired but at least the Bambino's tamper is in a traditional shape rather than the combination spoon and \"tamper\" combo Casbrews has Frankensteined.\n\nBreville Bambino is similar to most commercial machines in that it offers 9 bars of pressure, while the Casabrews CM5418 extracts at up to 20 bars. The bars refer to the pressurized hot water that is forced through the grounds to make espresso. The Overpressure Valve (OPV) limits the amount of pressure to help avoid overextraction and bitter-tasting coffee. You'll see 15 bar and above OPV extraction with at-home machines because the pressure can extract more from coarse grind sizes.\n\nThe lower bars of pressure, however, are often easier to use because the extraction is slower and more even for fine grind sizes. The takeaway is that the Breville Bambino operates similarly to more expensive commercial espresso machines, with the assumption you'll have a specialty grinder designed for espresso. It's also not surprising that Casabrews is catering to budget-conscious consumers: The Baratza Encore ESP grinder I used costs as much as the Casabrews CM5418 machine.\n\nThe Breville Bambino's rapid ThermoJet heating technology means you won't have much of a wait time until the espresso machine is ready to use. You still should purge the group head by pressing the 1 Cup or 2 Cup button to allow hot water to flow and stabilize the extraction before pulling your first shot. Ensuring the portafilter and group head are warmed makes insertion and rotation easier than when both are room temperature, bypassing the complaint I read in reviews that the portafilter could be difficult to lock in.\n\nCasabrews CM5418 doesn't have the quick heating innovations so you have to build pressure manually. If it's been sitting for days, you need to flush the machine, a process that lasts two minutes. At the very least, you will also need to pre-heat by clearing the group head and then running the hot water function for eight seconds to build pressure to pull a shot or use the steam wand. Without the flushing process, the Casabrews steam wand will only sputter. I didn't find the preparation intuitive, as I also found that if you leave the steam wand on for too long, the machine will need to cool down before you can pull an espresso shot.\n\nThe milk wand is often a subject of interest for online reviewers and potential customers. The Breville Bambino wins by a long shot over the Casabrews CM5418 for a couple of reasons. First, the Bambino steam wand offers more rotation, allowing you to hold the milk jug at a comfortable angle for the perfect microfoam or thick froth. The Casabrews only moves straight outward rather than a 180-degree rotation like the Bambino. Second, I found the Bambino delivers more pressure, even if it won't stand up to a commercial machine.\n\nThanks to the three-second heat time, the Breville Bambino has a three-second steam wand, which makes it easy to use the steam wand right away. This is especially helpful if you have a regular coffee machine or other drinks that you want to top with thick foam. The ease of use of each machine is more subjective than functionality, but the Breville Bambino proved its value (and its added cost) by avoiding the CM5418 issue of overheating.\n\nOne glaring flaw in the budget-friendly Casabrews CM5418\n\nThe biggest complaint I have with the value-driven Casabrews CM5418 is its propensity to overheat, and therefore stop working as a result of steaming milk. To avoid the \"overheat protection\" gridlock, the Casabrews CM5418 manual instructs you to pull an espresso shot first and then steam milk. This is the opposite of my barista training as espresso flavor degrades quickly and becomes bitter. This also means if you're groggy in the morning and decide to foam some milk to set aside, when you go to preheat the portafilter, the machine will most likely blink at you instead of filtering out old grounds you forgot to clean out the last time you used it. It's a confusing issue when first presented. I was also annoyed to have wasted the puck because it was just sitting in the hot group head -- in a surprise to no one, the final shot tasted bitter and burnt after the delay.\n\nRelieve the pressure by using the hot water function, employed by skipping the \"steam\" button and simply flipping the switch. Make sure you're also not using the steam function by accident. If you release it for more than the recommended eight seconds, then the steam wand once again loses all pressure. (More than once, I also forgot to push the \"steam\" button and simply infused hot water into my milk.) The large \"useful tips\" sticker on top of the machine also explains how to flush the system, a helpful if unsightly feature.\n\nI suspect the average user might learn how to make espresso on this budget machine, so the order wouldn't seem out of place. If you're like me and often forget the reversed order of operations from years of ingrained barista training, pre-heating but not overheating the Casabrews CM5418 machine could feel like a pain. This issue alone had me leaning toward the Bambino more often as my pre-coffee brain can rarely remember too many quirks, especially when it's something so deceptively simple.\n\nThe Casabrew CM5418 portafilter is a heavier weight, which I like. I don't understand why the basket filter is loose enough to rotate instead of locking in place. The loose filter makes it harder to knock out the used puck. The Bambino portafilter is perfectly adequate, even if I would prefer a heavier option with a longer handle.\n\nThe Casabrews portafilter is heavier and easier to hold thanks to its sizable handle. Plus, Casabrews is also designed to eliminate some guesswork of dialing in the ideal espresso shot. Its pressurized dual-wall basket filters and long pull duration out of the box result in a foamy crema mimicking popular Nespresso pod machines. I could pull a decent shot with a coarser grind than with the Breville, a boon to beginners who might be more easily discouraged. You will sacrifice some depth of flavor, but beginners to making espresso are likely to appreciate the added ease.\n\nThe Breville Bambino offers double and single-wall basket filters. The single-wall requires more understanding of grind and tamping but allows for more experimentation and nuanced flavors. The Breville manual explains the benefits of each, including how the pressurized double-wall is better for older beans purchased pre-ground. Learning the nuances of the machine is important to improve your skills but it does come down to preference. Keep in mind, a single-wall basket filter for the Casabrews CM5418 will have to be tracked down from a third party as I couldn't find the 51 millimeter size on the website.\n\nThe semi-automatic espresso machines are designed to automatically stop extraction after a period of time. At factory settings, I saw the Breville Bambino consistently pull double shots for about 22 seconds before stopping. The manual doesn't recommend a duration of extraction. The Casabrews manual recommends 25 to 45 seconds. (I wouldn't recommend pulling a shot for 45 seconds at this capacity.) I found that the Casabrews CM5418 factory settings pulled a double shot at about 32 seconds. I won't dive into the online debates about the ideal extraction duration because the unsatisfying answer is that the ideal extraction all depends on the grind, type and freshness of beans, tamp and temperature, among other factors.\n\nBoth semi-automatic espresso machines allow you to program the coffee volume. I recommend getting comfortable with your grind and tamp before changing the extraction but I found the process straightforward with both machines, even if it took a few tries to reach a decent flow.\n\nCasabrews includes a gauge on its front with a guide in the manual to the ideal pressure zone, or when it's built enough to pull a shot but not extracted with too much pressure. Also, just because there is more visible crema from the Casabrews' double-walled basket filters and factory settings doesn't mean it's necessarily a better-tasting shot. If you're drinking straight espresso instead of making a specialty drink like a latte, you'll likely want to adjust the duration a shot is brewed out of the box.\n\nIs the Breville Bambino or the Casabrews better?\n\nIf cost is your main concern when buying an espresso machine, then the Casabrews CM5418 will most likely satisfy any beginner to at-home espresso machines. The CM5418 is your best bet if you're someone who plans to use pre-ground espresso or doesn't want to invest in a grinder capable of a fine espresso grind. The design seems ideal for someone looking to upgrade from a Nespresso or any pod machine. When first learning to pull a passable shot, the Casabrews will smooth out more errors for most novice users. Early wins might mean the difference between using the machine or letting it sit to collect dust. I also understand the aesthetic appeal of seven color choices. Stainless steel might be classic but it's the only option for the Breville Bambino.\n\nBoth espresso machines will require the purchase of a new tamper, a scale and other accessories, so the lower price should make up for the additional initial costs. That said, while I love a dupe for less, you often get what you pay for, so the lower cost of the Casabrews espresso machine means that you have to stay more alert to pre-heat correctly, avoid steaming milk before pulling a shot, and potentially lose some of the character of your coffee. You should also keep your manual nearby if overheating happens. The Casabrews' temperature quirks quickly became cumbersome for me.\n\nIn the end, I'd recommend spending a bit more to buy the Breville Bambino because of the speedy ThermoJet technology, ease of use for the machine, the standardized pressure extraction, and a robust kit with a milk frother. The Bambino offers considerable value for its price tag, especially seeing you'll easily spend at least $200 more to upgrade to a machine with similar capabilities. The entry-level Bambino has the ability to experiment with grind sizes and extract more nuanced flavors as your abilities grow. Your skills are also likely to progress beyond the Casabrews CM5418 quicker than the Bambino, costing you more if you want to upgrade your machine or your grinder. You will also need to buy a separate milk steamer if you don't want to leave your espresso sitting while you steam or if you prefer a frothy cappuccino.",

      "text": "Plenty of folks love to start their day with a cup of coffee while they wake up and get ready. Brewing up the perfect cup takes time, practice and patience -- regardless of whether you prepare your coffee with a percolator, French press, pour over, espresso or cold brew.\nI pressed Sarina Prabasi, founder of the Buunni roastery and trio of coffeehouses in northern Manhattan, to root out simple mistakes people overlook when brewing coffee at home.\nBuunni specializes in ethically sourced beans from growing regions across Ethiopia. As a micro-roaster who serves on the board of the Specialty Coffee Association, Prabasi offered some insight into how to make simple adjustments for a better cup of coffee.\nHere are seven common coffee mistakes we're all guilty of from time to time. With these tips we'll help you take your morning brew experience from utilitarian to euphoric.\n1. Washing your coffee maker too often with detergent\nDitching the soap for your coffee pot and pour-over immersion brewer might seem like dubious advice. In reality, your coffee equipment doesn't need a scrub down every time you use it. Even small layers of residue from fragrant dish soap or washing detergent will leave you with a sudsy and subpar pot of coffee.\n\"It really stays in there; it can mess with the flavor, and so, usually, a good rinse with super hot water is enough for black coffee,\" Prabasi said. Oils from the beans may build up over time, so a fragrance-free dish soap comes in handy for the occasional deep clean. A simple rinse with hot water will more than suffice for daily use, however. Save yourself time and avoid any unwanted essence of \"soap scum\" interrupting the notes of your single-origin Sidama natural roast.\n2. Buying more coffee than you can brew fresh\nBuying in bulk can save time and money at the grocery store but can have disappointing results for coffee drinkers. Purchasing smaller quantities of beans will help avoid drinking stale, flat coffee, especially for the average drinker and households with one or two people. Probasi told us that you'll know coffee has gone stale because it \"can taste like a shadow of itself.\"\nThe roaster recommends looking for a roast date on the coffee label within one month or ideally within two weeks. (Keep in mind, the \"best buy\" date is different and isn't an indicator of freshness.) If you don't like to grind at home, the roast date needs to be on the fresher side.\nBut you needn't panic about declining flavor like a ticking time bomb in your cupboard. \"Every day post-roast doesn't mean it's losing freshness, but after two weeks, I'd say it starts to go down,\" Prabasi said. Store coffee in an airtight container but avoid the humid fridge with its plethora of smells that can stick to the beans.\n3. Adjusting more than one thing at a time\nYou can find tutorials online recommending brewers, scales, tampers, water filters, grinders and miscellaneous techniques to make the perfect cup. Experimentation is key to crafting your favorite brew but only if you start with the basics. \"So just adjust only the water in the beginning,\" Prabasi said.\nIf you don't have a kitchen scale, the roaster told us the rule of thumb is to start with two tablespoons of ground coffee per cup of water. The finer the grind, the stronger your coffee will taste, so you'll need to adjust the grounds-to-water ratio accordingly. If that seems too weak or too strong, then adjust by adding more or less coffee at the same grind level.\nBeyond the basics, you can get creative. \"If your coffee is too sour, it's maybe that you prefer a dark roast,\" Prabasi said. Coffee too bitter? You can adjust the type of roast by buying a level down, such as a dark to medium or medium to light. \" If you got a coffee from East Africa, maybe try one from South America, you know, like switch [it] around,\" she said. Changing one element at once ensures you know which step affected the result for better or worse.\n4. Using water straight from the tap\nFilling your coffee pot with tap water will yield less-than-ideal flavors. Filtered water, for most of us, will make a big difference in your coffee's final flavor. Tap water is often full of by-products that can be easily filtered with a home water filtration system.\nAlmost all of the water you get from the tap in the US is disinfected with low levels of chlorine. The EPA reports that one in five people drink chloramines, a backup disinfectant made of chlorine and ammonia, to kill harmful viruses and bacteria like salmonella. These chemicals make sure we don't get sick but will alter the taste and smell of tap water. Chloramines are also known to strip lead and copper from pipes, by-products that can affect even the most carefully prepared coffee.\n5. Forgetting to stop and smell the coffee\nSmell can be a dead giveaway that your coffee has gone stale. Prabasi explains that you should immediately open a bag of beans or ground coffee and be able to smell that roasted coffee scent. Aroma is a key indicator of flavor. No aroma means a serious lack of taste.\nPrabasi said stale coffee can taste muddy or flat and lack any complex tasting notes that a bag might list on its label. \" That's why I think for in the coffee profession, so much of what we do is tasting coffee,\" she said. \"From the farm to the coffee shop, every step of the way coffee gets tasted or cupped, in our vernacular.\"\nOld coffee isn't likely to make you sick, so there's no need to toss it. You might, however, want to shift from taking your coffee black. Making iced coffee is a simple way to mask the lack of tasting notes. Using an immersion brewer also allows you to steep grounds longer to add a bit more flavor after coffee has dulled.\n6. Ignoring the organic label\nThe multitude of coffee brands at the grocery store can feel overwhelming. To help sift through the masses, Prabasi explains the organic coffee label is a sign of quality that's important for coffee.\n\"If you can, then I think for coffee and tea, organic is really important because coffee and tea crops, especially from large farms, tend to get really over-sprayed,\" Prabasi said. Pesticides are sprayed right onto the coffee cherries, and coffee is unlike an apple that you can wash or a banana that you peel before eating. Tea leaves go through a similar process where anything left on the leaves will then be steeped into your mug.\nThe coffeehouse owner made it clear that she doesn't believe coffee needs to be expensive to be considered \"good.\" Great coffee is made for a variety of budgets. \" I think the care that goes into and some reflection on the care that goes into sourcing it, to roasting it or just serving it, I would be looking for those things,\" Prabasi said. The organic label is a helpful place to start.\n7. Always taking your coffee 'to go'\nEven if you don't think of coffee as purely a means to an end, many of us treat coffee as simply fuel. Taking coffee in a travel mug to drink as part of a commute isn't inherently a problem. Prabasi instead invites coffee drinkers to take advantage of any time and ability to savor a cup of coffee. In contrast to the grab-and-go culture in the US, drinking coffee in Ethiopia is an opportunity to slow down and connect with people you care about. \"And I like to say -- like, I lived in Ethiopia for eight years -- I never heard anybody say, 'I'm gonna grab a coffee,'\" Prabasi said. \"It was always, 'Let's have coffee. Shall we have coffee?'\"\nEven taking an extra 10 minutes to drink your brew at a cafe instead of requesting a to-go cup can shift the energy of a frenetic morning. \"I think there is lot of ritual around coffee and how one enjoys it,\" Prabasi said. Taking the time to create your own ritual, whether at home or in a local shop, can help you savor all that coffee has to offer beyond its caffeine content.\nFor more coffee intel, here's how to read coffee labels and the best travel mugs of 2025, tested by CNET."

      "text": "Pros\n- Intuitive operation\n- Quality of espresso and foam\n- Weighted portafilter\n- Narrow size fits in small spaces\n- Price\n- Variety of colors\nCons\n- Toggling between steam and coffee operation\n- Lightweight scoop/tamp\nIn testing espresso machines to find the best in class, we found that a really good model will cost north of $400. We found a serviceable budget pick at a fraction of that cost, but it still requires a good deal of kitchen real estate.\nAs an apartment dweller with limited counter space, I was eager to try the Casabrews CM5418, a diminutive espresso machine crafted by coffee enthusiasts and available for under $150. If the economy has you down and you're hoping to blunt your coffee shop spending by making espresso drinks at home, here's everything you need to know about the $140 Casabrews before buying.\nCasabrews CM5418 at a glance\n- Style: Semiautomatic espresso machine with 1-cup, 2-cup and steam wand capabilities\n- Dimensions: 5.47 by 12.28 by 11.97 inches (width, depth, height)\n- Watts: 1,350\n- Weight: 10.4 pounds\n- Price: $140\nAbout Casabrews\nCasabrews launched in 2020 in response to the pandemic, with the company noting that more people were making coffee at home and wanted the small, daily luxury that quality espresso afforded, without the daily trip out of the house. Founded by a team of young coffee enthusiasts, and with the tagline \"my casa, my coffee,\" Casabrews was intended to offer the American market espresso machines that are not only affordable but also well designed and high quality.\nThe CM5418 is a midline model among the machines Casabrews offers, but its primary source of interest to me was its relatively small space requirement. At only about 5.5 inches wide, it works in the smallest of small kitchens -- that's about all the counter space I have left, after the necessary toaster oven. (By comparison, the Breville Oracle Jet I tested took up all my available counter space, even after the toaster oven was ejected to make way.) Also of note: Unlike most other espresso machine manufacturers, Casabrews is only in the espresso machine business.\nCasabrews CM5418 operation\nThis Casabrews model went from unboxing to brewing in minimal time. There aren't any tricks to getting the machine up and running. The detachable water tank is unfussy to load and unload in order to refill, and the one-shot and two-shot cups are simple to interchange in the portafilter. The buttons are intuitive: Blinking blue lights indicate the machine is readying itself, and when the lights are steady, it's good to go. The heavy duty portafilter also locks in place snugly and effortlessly.\nThe built-in pressure gauge isn't adjustable, but it offers confidence in the 20 bars of pressure the brand promises. What's more, the proof is in the pudding: The shots pull slowly and consistently, producing a bold brew with a thick crema in about 25 seconds, even with conventional coffee grounds.\nI have no barista training, so I'm an ideal candidate for testing the foam wand of an at-home espresso machine. This one created a powerful whirlpool, whipping and heating the milk into a thick, creamy and pourable foam that in no way resembled dish suds. (If you think this is a given, then you haven't much experimented with espresso machines.) The only thing the machine can't do for you is latte art, but given the quality of the coffee and foam, you may be motivated to practice.\nWhat I liked about the Casabrews CM5418\nThere's a lot to like about the Casabrews CM5418, beginning with its size and price but by no means ending there. Its intuitiveness and its quality output are more than enough to justify its price tag, but a few other features may be of interest if you're considering buying one.\nMy favorite feature of this machine -- other than the fact that it made great coffee -- was the portafilter. This might be otherwise overlooked, but it matters in terms of your willingness to use the machine on a daily basis. The portafilter included here is not only heavyweight but it also has a particular design and balance, allowing it to sit level on the countertop for easy filling and tamping. This is the detail that sold me on a machine that was thoughtfully made by coffee people for potentially non\u2013coffee people (or burgeoning coffee people).\nThe CM5418 also comes in a variety of colors, for people uninterested in adding another black or stainless steel appliance into their morning routine. Though the price goes up a bit, for $170 you can add a splash of color to the proceedings: two different shades of blue, plus a creamy beige and a cheerful pink.\nFinally, a 30-day money back guarantee is available if you buy directly from Casabrews, where promotional discounts are also frequently available. A current 15% off promotion means the stainless steel model runs you only $120. That's about a month's worth of out-of-the-house espresso drinks.\nRead more: Skip the Trip to a Coffee Shop and Make Homemade Iced or Hot Lattes\nWhat I didn't like about the Casabrews CM5418\nThe only odd element with the Casabrews CM5418 is toggling between making coffee and making steam, which is pushed through the steam wand to create a frothy milk. In fairness, this is addressed in the manual and the quick-start guide, on the website, and even on a \"useful tips\" sticker included on the machine. Expelling hot water through the steam wand is important for both ensuring hot espresso and switching back to making espresso after making steam. (It can also be used as a moment to preheat your coffee mug, so it's not entirely a wasted step.)\nIt's not challenging to do the toggling, but if you're reluctant to read instructions, you may find yourself sitting in front of a panel of flashing lights wondering why you can't make a second cappuccino.\nWhile the portafilter is tremendous, the tamper included with this model isn't: It's a cheap, plastic model that acts as both scoop and tamper. It doubtless keeps the price down, but you'll want to upgrade it. With many heavier duty espresso tampers available at various online retailers for less than $15, the CM5418 is still a bargain.\nFinal verdict on the Casabrews CM5418\nThough a small kitchen doesn't necessarily mean a small budget, for folks who crave the luxury of espresso but think they don't have the means or the space, the Casabrews CM5418 can really challenge those assumptions. Slimmer than an average toaster, cheaper than a month of Starbucks and capable of allowing nonbaristas to make barista-quality drinks, the Casabrews CM5418 might be the ideal model for folks on the fence."

      "text": "There's no better way to start your day than with a cup of delicious coffee. Having the right coffee blends can make all of the difference in your morning brew. If you're having trouble finding specialty coffee blends at your local store or just want to change up your morning brew, a coffee subscription might be just what you need.\nOur Picks\nCoffee subscriptions offer the chance to sample organic beans from across the world, with freshly roasted options shipped directly to your doorstep. The best services not only cater to your personal preferences but also introduce you to an exciting range of flavors that can completely change how you experience coffee. No matter your preferred brewing method or whether you like a light or dark roast, there's something for every coffee lover. We've tested the leading online coffee providers to help you find the very best options available.\nWhat's the best coffee subscription in 2025?\nAtlas Coffee Club has excellent coffee beans, freshly roasted and approachable prices. It's also simple to buy a membership for someone else, which is why Atlas tops our list as the best coffee club to give someone (or yourself) this year.\nRead more: 22 Great Gifts for $50 or Less\nBest coffee clubs and subscriptions of 2025\nPros\n- Gifting a subscription is easy\n- Quality coffee for a good price\n- Responsibly sourced beans\n- Includes information on the coffee regions\nCons\n- No information from the individual roaster is provided\n- Website is a little clunky\nIf you're looking for the cheapest coffee club, Atlas is the most budget-friendly of the many we've tried. It might also be the most giftable of the coffee subscriptions because each delivery feels like something a friend would send you while traveling the world.\nAtlas Coffee Club delivers single-origin craft coffee from more than 50 countries and draws from independent coffee roasters where amazing coffee is produced. Not only is the coffee high quality -- I got incredible roasts from Peru, Tanzania and Costa Rica -- but every coffee subscription box delivery comes with a postcard featuring its country of origin, as well as a message with tasting notes and brewing tips.\nAtlas makes gifting easy with free US shipping and two subscription options -- every two or four weeks -- starting at just $6 for a half bag (with a first-time discount).\nPros\n- Consistently good coffee\n- A portion of proceeds go to dog rescue organizations\nCons\n- Not as much variety\n- Not as good for adventurous coffee drinkers\n- Expensive\n\"Every pound saves a hound,\" is the slogan of Grounds and Hounds coffee company, which donates 20% of all profits to dog rescue organizations. With blends like Morning Walk, Paper & Slippers and even a decaf roast called Hush Puppy, this is the perfect subscription for dog lovers.\nThe coffee I had when I tried Ground and Hounds was fresh, smooth and mild but perhaps a little less exciting than some of the other clubs. It's a great subscription to please a wide range of coffee drinkers, with nothing that'll scare away a person with a less adventurous palate. You also won't find as many niche roasters with this service but what it does send is high quality and consistently good.\nYou can join the Grounds and Hounds Coffee Club with a subscription requiring at least two bags (around $28 minimum). It's the ideal way to keep a steady supply of coffee at the ready for those post-walk mornings in front of the fireplace with your best buddy snoozing at your feet.\nPros\n- Good for trying lots of coffees in each delivery\n- Good for gifting\n- Affordable\nCons\n- Samplers have a fair amount of extra packaging\n- Not much customization allowed\nBean Box highlights renowned Seattle roasters. You choose either ground or whole bean coffee, then your taste preferences are followed by a choice of one bag or two per shipment, which will come every two or four weeks. Plans start at a very affordable $17 for pay-per-delivery or $485 for an annual plan.\nIf you're looking for gift ideas, there are three subscription options. The Curator's Coffee of the Month Club, Coffee Around the World Subscription and US Coffee Road Trip subscription. The Curator's Coffee of the Month Club has options for three months, six months or annual starting at $72, World Coffee Tour and US Coffee Road Trip both have four, eight and 12-month subscriptions. The first starts at $120 and the latter at $98.\nPros\n- High-quality and interesting beans\n- Female-owned service that partners with female-owned roasters\n- All fair trade\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Limited variety\nThis NYC-based roaster sends some of the best organic, fair-trade coffee from various regions around the world to you in signature bright purple packaging. Many of the service's producers are female-owned and you can use a filter to narrow your search to include only those. In a trial run of Bean & Bean, I got some of the most interesting coffees of any club on the list. I tried the organic Peru Las Damas (chocolate lemon and orange notes) and a female-owned Santa Felisha Purple Gesha honey coffee (currently out of stock) from Guatemala and both were fresh-tasting, complex and flavorful.\nThis is one of the pricier services and breaks down to about $24 a bag (inclusive of shipping). Considering it's mostly organic and fair-trade coffee that supports female-owned businesses and the coffee is all roasted and ground to order, I think it's worth the extra few bucks a month.\nPros\n- Advanced algorithm to find different coffees you'll love\n- Enormous selection of beans from global roasters\nCons\n- Plans are expensive if you don't order with high frequency\n- Not worth it for those who want the same beans every time\nThis is one of the smartest coffee subscriptions I tried. Trade has taste algorithms down to a science and just about every coffee I had delivered was right in my flavor wheelhouse. As far as types of coffee subscription options go, you can select your style of coffee and pay per shipment for $16 or prepay for 3 or 6 bags.\nWith a slick website and fun marketing copy, this is the cool kid coffee club to be certain. The good news is that Trade has some great beans, too. If you love traveling around the US and always check out the local coffee scene when you do, a Trade coffee subscription box is a good one for you. They have all the best coffee roasters from across the country, like Gimme! from the East Coast, Sightglass from the West Coast, Intelligentsia from the Third Coast and even more artisan coffee roasters.\nPros\n- Consistently good coffee\n- Beans are always fresh\n- Option for 100% fair-trade organic\nCons\n- On the expensive side\n- Not as many unique coffees\nSome subscriptions had some misses together with the hits but I tried Equator Coffee for a few months and there wasn't a bad bean in the bunch. Yes, taste is subjective but for me, this was the most consistent coffee subscription service, sending fresh, flavorful and interesting whole beans from places like Ethiopia and Colombia.\nCurated blend subscriptions start at $19 and will net you one 12-ounce bag of coffee per month (free shipping). The cheapest bags of subscription coffee start at $10 a month (for espresso pods -- shipping not included). If you don't want to commit to a subscription, Equator has an entire shop of fabulous coffee available for a one-time send. Shipping is free on orders of more than $45.\nPros\n- Good for those who know what they like but still crave variety\n- Rotating list of over 50 premium roasters\nCons\n- Some shipments were late\n- Service sends a lot of emails\nSome folks can be particular about their coffee beans and Mistobox understands that. Celebrates it, even.\nThis is another coffee club we tried and it really does feel like a club. When you join this slick coffee subscription club, it'll take you through a tasting quiz to hone in on exactly what types of coffee you like. You'll answer questions about the preferred roast level and intensity, blends versus single-origin and more. MistoBox even wants to know how you take your coffee -- black, with cream or espresso-style. From there it'll pull from a roster of more than 60 roasters and get the best beans in your hands monthly. The service will then use an algorithm based on what you liked and didn't like to keep the coffee you do like rolling in.\nWith shipping ($5 per order) a 12-ounce bag of beans will start at $15 a bag but you can save a little by paying upfront for a longer subscription. I tried this subscription and found it had one of the most impressive rosters of producers including cult favorites such as Methodical, Bixby Brothers and Ritual.\nPros\n- Some of the most interesting coffee roasts we tried\n- Beans are shipped in producer's unique packaging\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Not as much customization\nFellow's coffee subscription scores points for combining high-quality coffee beans with a simple, no-fuss ordering and delivery system. The whole beans I received in my month-long trial of Fellow were excellent and interesting and included a dreamy Agaro Ethiopian roast with notes of peach and bergamot.\nThis coffee subscription service has a new and unique text-to-order system. First, you'll sign up for Fellow's program and provide your mobile number. Each week the expert panel selects a new coffee and texts you the pick. It's then up to you to decide if you want to order a bag or two. Prices vary from week to week.\nHow we test coffee subscriptions\nTo test these coffee subscriptions, we start from the beginning just as any coffee-drinking customer would by filling out questionnaires and quizzes that are standard on most coffee subscriptions nowadays. From there, we'll select at least three deliveries of whole beans. Once we're signed up, we track how accurate and consistent the monthly or weekly shipments are. Most importantly, we grade each service on how good the coffee tastes and smells. We also consider whether it delivers on the initial promise of finding new and interesting coffee we love based on that initial information gathering and our real-time feedback.\nFactors to consider when choosing a coffee subscription\nType of coffee subscription\nSome coffee subscriptions do a lot of work in helping you find the perfect beans with questionnaires and rating systems while others simply send what you already know you love. If you're open to new coffee types and beans from small roasters, there are services such as Trade and Fellow that specialize in sending a variety of beans. If it's coffee consistency you seek, a service such as Grounds and Hounds or even a recurring subscription from FreshDirect would likely be a better fit.\nWhole bean or ground\nMost coffee subscriptions encourage you to order whole beans and grind them yourself since that will maximize freshness. If you prefer to skip that step, several services on this list will gladly put it through the coffee grinder before mailing it to you.\nCost and pricing\nCoffee bean subscriptions typically cost more than your bag of Folgers or Starbucks Pike Place Roast from the local grocery store but that's because they focus on quality, harder-to-find beans and roasting fresh before sending to you. Some subscriptions can be had for as cheap as $13 a bag, while other premium coffee clubs can cost over $20 per bag. Decide what your budget is for coffee per month and activate a membership that fits.\nFrequency of bean delivery\nMost coffee subscription services will let you choose a delivery frequency and some help you figure out exactly how much you'll need and when.\nWhy you might want to try a coffee subscription\nUnbeatable selection of coffee, often from small, indie producers\nLocal roasters and good markets are one way to try a few new coffees here and there. To open up an entire globe of coffee options, a good coffee subscription or coffee club will give you the most variety for ordering and tasting beans. For curious coffee drinkers who aren't set in their ways, a coffee subscription is an excellent way to try new styles and roasts from small producers.\nPlus, most coffee clubs on this list source from small, independent and fair-trade roasters. Many of these purveyors wouldn't have much reach without online customers, so consider your subscription a boon to small businesses. (You can save that bag of Starbucks or Folgers for when the in-laws visit).\nCoffee clubs send fresh coffee, roasted just before shipping\nVariety is a huge reason to love coffee clubs, freshness is arguably just as important and the best coffee clubs will roast your beans just before sending them, with no time wasted on a shelf store where they lose punch and flavor. Trust me, you'll notice the difference between fresh and stale store-bought as soon as you open the bag.\nRead more: Best Tea Subscriptions\nA coffee subscription means you'll always have beans around\nPerhaps the most obvious benefit of a coffee subscription or coffee-of-the-month club is convenience. Coffee is one of those groceries you forget to chuck in the cart, and it's never fun when you realize it the next morning. A coffee subscription ensures good beans are always on hand. And if a subscription feels like too much, most coffee clubs and online coffee retailers offer a one-time shipment of beans -- ground or whole -- to try out the goods without commitment."
