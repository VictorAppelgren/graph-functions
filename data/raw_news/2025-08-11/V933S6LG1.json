  "content": "iOS 26 includes three small but meaningful changes for screenshots.\n\n\n\nThe upcoming software update adds a new Screen Capture menu to the Settings app, under General. In it, there are a few useful toggles.\n\nFirst, there is now an option for HDR screenshots. When this format is selected, any HDR photos or videos in screenshots will actually appear in HDR with full dynamic range, when viewed on newer iPhone models and other supported devices.\n\nApple says HDR screenshots use the HEIF image format. There is still an option for SDR screenshots, which are saved as PNG files.\n\nSecond, CarPlay screenshots finally work on an opt-in basis. On iOS 18 and earlier, taking a screenshot on an iPhone connected to CarPlay generates both iPhone and CarPlay screenshots. Starting with iOS 26, however, only an iPhone screenshot is captured in this situation by default. CarPlay screenshot capture must be turned on manually.\n\nThird, when you take a screenshot on an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, you can now identify content within the screenshot by using the Visual Intelligence feature.\n\nApple has redesigned the screenshot interface on iOS 26, with Visual Intelligence options now shown at the bottom of the screen. \"Ask\" lets you ask ChatGPT about content in a screenshot, while \"Image Search\" can show you similar images to those in a screenshot across Google Images, Etsy, and Pinterest. There is also a \"Highlight to Search\" option that lets you conduct an image search for a specific object in a screenshot.\n\nIf you would rather have screenshots appear as thumbnails in the bottom-left corner of the screen, as they do on iOS 18 and earlier versions, you can turn off full-screen previews in the new Screen Capture settings menu.\n\niOS 26 is currently in beta. The update should be released in September.",

      "text": "Visual Intelligence, an Apple Intelligence feature that Apple introduced last year, has some new capabilities in iOS 26 that make it more useful and better able to compete with the functionality available through some Android smartphones.\nOnscreen Awareness\nIn iOS 18, Visual Intelligence only works with the camera, but in iOS 26, it also works with what's on your device. You can capture a screenshot of what's on your screen and then use Visual Intelligence on it to identify what you're looking at, find images, and get more information through ChatGPT.\nHow to Get Use Onscreen Awareness for Visual Intelligence\nVisual Intelligence for screenshots works about the same as Visual Intelligence with the camera app, but it's located in the screenshot interface. Take a screenshot (hold down the volume up button and the side button), and then tap out of the Markup interface if it's showing.\nTo get out of Markup (which is the default view), tap on the little pen icon at the top of the display. From there, you should see the Visual Intelligence options.\nHighlight to Search\nWith Highlight to Search for Visual Intelligence onscreen content awareness, you can use a finger to draw over the object in the screenshot that you want to look up. It's similar to Android's Circle to Search feature.\nHighlight to Search lets you conduct an image search for a specific object in a screenshot, even if there are multiple things in the picture. It uses Google Image search by default, but Apple showed off the feature working with other apps like Etsy during its keynote event. Apps will likely need to add support for the feature.\nIn some cases, Visual Intelligence will identify individual objects in an image on its own, and you can tap without needing to use Highlight to Search. This is similar to the object identification feature in the Photos app, but it still leads to an image search.\nAsk and Search\nIf you don't need to isolate one object in your screenshot, you can simply tap on the Ask button to ask questions about what you're seeing. Questions will be relayed to ChatGPT, and ChatGPT will provide the information. The Search button queries Google Search for more information.\nAs with the standard Visual Search, if your screenshot includes dates, times, and related information for an event, it can be added directly to your calendar.\nNew Object Identification\nApple didn't mention it, but Visual Intelligence adds support for quick identification of new types of objects. It can now identify art, books, landmarks, natural landmarks, and sculptures, in addition to the animals and plants it was able to provide information on before.\nIf you use Visual Intelligence on an object that it is able to recognize, you'll see a small glowing icon pop up. Tapping on it reveals information about what's in view. What's neat about this aspect of Visual Intelligence is that it works with the live camera view or with a snapped photo.\nFor standard Ask and Search requests using Visual Intelligence, you have to take a photo so that it can be relayed to sources like ChatGPT or Google Image Search. Art, books, landmarks, natural landmarks, sculptures, plants, and animals can be identified on-device without contacting another service.\nCompatibility\nVisual Intelligence is limited to devices that support Apple Intelligence, which includes the iPhone 15 Pro models and the iPhone 16 models. It is activated by a long press on the Camera Control button on devices that have Camera Control, or using the Action Button or a Control Center toggle.\nLaunch Date\niOS 26 is in beta testing right now, but it will launch to the public in September."

      "text": "Apple has made available the second public beta of iOS 26, bringing the new software to a wider audience following initial testing by developers. Keep reading to learn how to prepare your device for the beta software and how to install it.\nSigning up to get the iOS 26 or iPadOS 26 public beta is simple, and can be done by enrolling an iPhone or iPad in Apple's free Apple Beta Software Program. The steps you need to complete to install the software on your device are provided towards the end of this article, but before you jump ahead, here are a few things worth considering.\nIs My iPhone Compatible With iOS 26?\niOS 26 is compatible with the iPhone 11 series and newer. In other words, the following models are supported:\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\n- iPhone 15\n- iPhone 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 14\n- iPhone 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone 12\n- iPhone 12 mini\n- iPhone 12 Pro\n- iPhone 12 Pro Max\n- iPhone 11\n- iPhone 11 Pro\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE (2nd generation and later)\nShould I Install iOS 26 Public Beta?\nGreat question! Before downloading the update, it's worth noting that Apple does not recommend installing iOS 26 beta updates on your main iPhone, so if you have a secondary device, use that. This is beta software, which means there are often bugs and issues that pop up that can prevent software from working properly or cause other problems. Apple undoubtedly has plenty of fixes to make before the final release.\nMake an Archived Backup of Your Device First\nBefore installing the beta, make sure to back up your iOS device before installing the software using the following method, otherwise you won't be able to revert back to iOS 18 if things go wrong.\n- Plug your iPhone into your Mac using the supplied cable.\n- Allow the accessory to connect by clicking Allow in the dialog prompt.\n- Open a Finder window by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.\n- Click your iOS device's name in the sidebar.\n- If this is the first time connecting your device to your Mac, click Trust in the Finder window.\n- Tap Trust on your device when prompted, then enter your passcode to confirm.\n- In the General tab, click the circle next to where it says Back up all of the data on your iPad to this Mac.\n- If you want to encrypt the backup, check the box next to Encrypt local backup, then enter a password to protect your data.\n- If you don't want to create an encrypted backup, or you've already set up encrypted backups, click Back Up Now.\nWhen the backup is finished, you can find the date and time of the last backup in the General tab, just above the Manage Backups button. Remember that this backup will not be overwritten when you manually or automatically back up your iPhone in the future, so you can restore it at any time by using the Restore Backup... option in the same Finder screen.\nHow to Download iOS 26 Public Beta\nDownloading and install the iOS 26 Public Beta is very straightforward. Simply follow these steps:\n- Head over to Apple's Beta Software Program website and sign up using your Apple Account credentials.\n- Now go to Settings \u279d General \u279d Software Update on your iPhone.\n- Tap Beta Updates. If you don't see the option, try switching off Download iOS Updates (Automatic Updates \u279d Download iOS Updates), then tap Back and it should appear.\n- Select iOS 26 Public Beta in the list, then tap Back.\n- Wait for the Software Update screen to check Apple's servers. When the iOS 26 Public Beta appears, tap Download and Install, then follow the instructions and wait for installation to complete.\niOS 26 Features\niOS 26 introduces a striking system-wide redesign built around Liquid Glass, a translucent material that reflects and refracts ambient content and dynamically responds to user input. The new aesthetic applies across the Lock Screen, Home Screen, toolbar controls, navigation elements, app icons, and widgets.\nThe update also brings new Apple Intelligence features. With Live Translation available in Messages, FaceTime, and Phone, conversations across languages are now seamless and entirely on-device to ensure privacy. New Visual Intelligence capabilities mean you can ask questions about screen content. There are also smarter Shortcuts with intelligent actions to make automation easier.\nCommunication apps gain smart upgrades too. The revamped Phone app now combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails in one view, adds Call Screening, and includes a clever Hold Assist feature. Messages gains filtered inboxes for unknown senders, typing indicators in group chats, custom backgrounds and polls, and Apple Cash transfers.\nCarPlay gets a visual refresh aligned with the Liquid Glass design and now includes compact call notifications, tappable Message reactions, pinned conversations, widgets, and Live Activities support.\nApple has also updated some of its key apps: Apple Music adds Lyrics Translation and Pronunciation plus AutoMix DJ-style transitions; Maps introduces privacy-protected \"Visited Places\" and smarter route preferences; Wallet supports installment/rewards payments, refreshed boarding passes with Live Activities, and deeper integrations with Maps and Find My. Lastly, a new Games app debuts as a central hub for mobile gaming, featuring a unified library, Apple Arcade support, event tracking, and friend status updates.\nFor a full breakdown of what's new, be sure to check out our dedicated iOS 26 roundup."

      "text": "iPadOS 26\nApple's next-generation operating system for the iPad, coming in fall 2025.\niPadOS 26 - What's New\nContents\n- iPadOS 26 - What's New\n- iPadOS 18 to iPadOS 26\n- Design Changes\n- Multitasking and Windowing\n- Home Screen and Lock Screen\n- Messages\n- Phone\n- Apple Music\n- Shortcuts\n- Other New App Features\n- Battery Settings\n- Apple Intelligence Updates\n- New AirPods Features\n- Smaller Changes\n- Accessibility\n- Compatibility\n- iPadOS 26 Launch Date\n- iPadOS 26 Timeline\nApple unveiled the newest version of iPadOS, iPadOS 26, at the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference in June. If you were expecting iPadOS 19, you might be a little surprised to see Apple jump to iPadOS 26, but the new number reflects the 2025\u20132026 release season for the software update. It lets Apple use the same number across all of its updates, so there's no more confusion since you're no longer downloading iOS, macOS, visionOS, and watchOS all with different numbers.\niPadOS 26 brings the first new major design change that Apple has brought to iOS since iOS 7. Liquid Glass reflects and refracts its surroundings, while putting more focus on content. Many interface elements are almost entirely translucent, and the design extends to controls, navigation, app icons, menus, buttons, and widgets.\nLiquid Glass transforms depending on content or context, and it behaves like glass in the real world, so color bleeds through from the background, and it is able to adapt well between light and dark elements. Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering and can dynamically react to movement to change the way that light reflects off of buttons, switches, sliders, side bars, tab bars, and more.\nYou'll see Liquid Glass throughout iPadOS 26, in all of Apple's apps, in notifications, on the Lock Screen, in Control Center, and on the Home Screen. Apple is also providing developers with tools to bring the new material to their own apps for a cohesive look. Liquid Glass extends to iOS 26, macOS Tahoe, visionOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26.\nThe Liquid Glass design overhaul isn't just a glossy finish, it also brings updates to the design of controls, toolbars, and navigation throughout iPadOS 26. App windows, menu bars, and other interface elements have more rounded corners, and controls feature a distinct functional layer designed to sit above apps. These kinds of menus can dynamically morph to provide users with more options in an app.\nThe Lock Screen features a spatial scene option for photo wallpapers, giving them a 3D look and a sense of movement. The Home Screen might look different with an option for translucent icons and widgets, but it is functionally the same.\nApple streamlined the Camera app layout with simpler navigation. It has Photo and Video toggles, with other options tucked away behind menus that expand out with a tap. You can swipe to get to more photo and video options. Apple also updated the Photos app to re-add separate tabs for the Library and Collections views. In Photos, you can also activate Spatial Scene for any image, getting a unique 3D view of the image.\nSafari has a new look, and Apple has updated navigation. By default, Safari adopts the more rounded Liquid Glass buttons and nixes the settings at the bottom of the app, but there's an option to bring them back with a floating tab bar if you prefer a more feature rich menu. Apple Music, News, and Podcasts all have a new tab bar that floats above the content in the app and dynamically shrinks when users are browsing, so the interface options take up less space on the display.\nApple has introduced a whole new multitasking and windowing system. The iPad is more like the Mac than ever, with the option to open multiple app windows and place and resize them as needed much like on the Mac. iPad apps now have menu bars and Mac-style window controls for closing, minimizing, resizing, and tiling windows.\nExpos\u00e9 is available on the iPad, so users can see all of the apps they have open with a tap. Apple removed Slide Over and Split View, but Stage Manager is still available for those who want to group their different windows together. External displays are supported for using even more apps at once. The iPad's cursor is now like the Mac cursor, and with the Magic Keyboard, the trackpad feels more like the Mac trackpad too.\nAlong with a new design and updated multitasking features, Apple is expanding the Apple Intelligence features that are available on the iPad. Messages, FaceTime, and a new Phone app for the iPad all support Live Translation for automatically translating conversations when you're conversing with someone who speaks another language.\nImage Playground supports ChatGPT image generation so you can create images in more styles. Genmoji has a new feature for mixing multiple emoji characters to make a new one, and adding descriptions to create an all-new emoji character.\nThe Shortcuts app supports intelligent actions that can summarize text, create images, or tap into Apple Intelligence models, making it easier than ever to create automations. Reminders is able to suggest tasks, grocery items and follow-ups based on emails, and it can automatically categorize related reminders into sections.\nFor developers, Apple is debuting a new Foundation Models framework that allows developers to tap into the AI model that's at the core of Apple Intelligence, so developers can add new AI features to their apps.\nApple brought the Phone app to the iPad for the first time, and it works through a connected iPhone with Wi-Fi calling. The Phone app has a whole slew of features that are new on both the iPhone and the iPad. There's a unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails. A new Call Screening feature asks unknown callers for their name and reason for calling before sending the call to you, stopping unwanted calls. When you're stuck on hold, there's a Hold Assist option that stays on the line for you, so you don't have to listen to irritating hold music. It lets you know when a live agent is available.\nMessages can screen texts from unknown senders, sending them silently to a dedicated folder where users can ask for more information or delete them. Group texts now have typing indicators and support for sending and receiving Apple Cash, plus Messages adds customizable backgrounds for each conversation and polls.\nIn Apple Music, there's a Lyrics Translation feature that translates lyrics that aren't in your language, and Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce those lyrics. A new AutoMix feature uses intelligence to transition from one song to another, using time stretching and beat matching for a seamless shift between songs.\nApple added a new Apple Games app that's an all-in-one destination for discovering and playing games. It supports recommendations, leaderboards, competitions with friends, and more.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\niPadOS 18 to iPadOS 26\nIf you're wondering why Apple went from iPadOS 18 to iPadOS 26, it was to streamline operating system naming. Apple is numbering all of its operating systems with the year going forward, so the \"26\" in iPadOS 26 represents the release season between September 2025 and September 2026.\nEverything released this year uses the same number, so iOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and so on. It's meant to help keep numbering more straightforward in the future, even if it seems strange to skip iPadOS 19 and go right to iPadOS 26.\nDesign Changes\nThe biggest single change in iPadOS 26 is the design overhaul. Apple is using a new Liquid Glass material throughout iOS and iPadOS, and it has transformed the look of the iPad's software.\nLiquid Glass is translucent, and like real glass, it allows light and color to shine through to put the focus on the content that's on your iPad's display. Apple designed Liquid Glass to behave like it does in the real world, so it can subtly reflect light when you move your iPad. It uses real-time rendering to dynamically react to movement with reflective highlights.\nApp icons are meant to look like several layers of glass, which gives them a subtle depth. Liquid Glass works well for the standard color icons, but Apple also added a translucent app icon option that makes your iPad look even more like a sheet of glass.\nPop Out Menus\nIn several places, Apple streamlined navigation and moved extra settings into pop out menus. In the Camera app, for example, Apple shows just the two main modes: photo and video. But if you tap on one of the buttons, you'll see a pop out menu with a range of quick access photo settings that you can activate.\nApple says it wanted controls, toolbars, and navigation to have a distinct functional layer that sits above apps, morphing and dynamically changing as users need to access more options.\nDisappearing Navigation\nIn several places, navigation elements disappear when they're not needed, and appear when they are. An example of this is in Safari at smaller window sizes. When you scroll down, the navigation bar with controls collapse down into a smaller bar to reveal more of the content on the page. Scrolling back up brings back the full Safari bar so you can use the interface buttons that you need.\nCorners and Spacing\nIn areas with a long list of options or categories, such as the Settings app, Apple has increased spacing and padding for a less cluttered look. You need to scroll longer to get through settings now, but there's more space to tap and it can be more readable with the additional spacing.\nApple shrunk navigation bars at the bottom of apps, so they take up less display space. A good example of this is in the Photos app, where the editing options have been condensed down into a smaller bar.\nNavigation bars, side bars, card-style menus, notifications, buttons, toggles, search bars, and other interface elements have a more rounded look. Single buttons are entirely circular, such as those in Control Center, while navigation bars are pill-shaped with distinctly round corners. Toggles and notifications have an elongated pill-shape too, and cards are also more rounded in appearance at the corners. The keyboard has round edges at the top.\nCross-Platform Cohesiveness\nLiquid Glass is not exclusive to iPadOS 26. The new design extends to all of Apple's operating systems, including iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and of course, visionOS 26, which is the OS that inspired the overhaul.\nWith the same design available across all of Apple's operating systems, everything feels more cohesive, which was one of Apple's main goals with Liquid Glass.\nDesign Summary\n- Everything looks different in iPadOS 26.\n- There's an emphasis on content, with Apple aiming to make everything else fade away.\n- Interface elements are made from Liquid Glass, which is translucent and designed to work like glass in the real world. Colors and content shine through, and everything has a more liquid feel.\n- Almost all interface elements are rounder.\n- Navigation elements and settings are meant to hide away when you don't need them. If you're missing a setting, it's likely you'll find it in a pop out menu when you tap on a single icon.\n- Liquid Glass is system wide. Apple's apps have been redesigned with it to varying degrees, and third-party apps will also adopt the design language.\nMultitasking and Windowing\nApple overhauled how multitasking and windowing work on the iPad, so now it offers a much more Mac-like experience.\nWindows\nYou can open multiple app windows at one time, and drag them anywhere on the display. They can overlap and move slightly offscreen, just like on the Mac. On some older iPads, you're limited to four open app windows, but on newer Apple silicon models, you can have far more.\nThere are multiple tiling options for open windows. You can arrange windows with a quick flick, and split your screen for two apps, three apps, or four apps. Tiling options can also be accessed from the menu bar.\nExternal displays increase the visual space for your open windows, and using an iPad with an external display makes much more sense with the updated organizational system.\nThe iPad remembers the sizing and placement of apps, so if you close an app and then open it again, it reappears in the same size and position.\nWith the new multitasking features, Apple eliminated the previous Split View and Slide Over options for window tiling and viewing multiple apps, but Stage Manager still exists for those who want to group their windows together.\nStage Manager\nWith iPadOS 26, Stage Manager is expanding to a larger number of iPad Models. All iPads that are compatible with iPadOS 26 have access to Stage Manager, so the feature is now available on the third-generation iPad Air and later, 5th-generation iPad mini and later, and 8th-generation iPad and later.\nStage Manager supports arranging multiple app windows in groups to improve multitasking. Stage Manager continues to be an opt-in feature, and it pairs with the iPadOS 26 multitasking features.\nMenu Bars\niPad apps now have Mac-style menu bars at the top of them, so you can get quick access to settings. There are Mac-style traffic light buttons for resizing, closing, and expanding iPad windows. Menu bars can be accessed with a swipe down from the top of the iPad's display.\nThird-party developers can also create custom menu bars for their iPad apps.\nExpos\u00e9\nThe Mac's Expos\u00e9 feature for showing you everything you have open is now available on the iPad. You can swipe up to see all of your windows spread out, and then tap on one to bring it to the front.\nDock\nFolders can go in the dock, which makes them quicker to access when you need something.\nFiles App\nThe Files app supports a new list view with resizable columns and collapsible folders for the first time, so you can better see what's in a folder without having to open the entire thing.\nYou can set default apps for opening different file types, and folders can be customized with colors and emoji to make them easier to find.\nBackground Tasks\niPadOS 26 supports background tasks, so you can download or export large files or run other system intensive tasks while using your iPad like normal. When a background task is in progress, it can be tracked with Live Activities.\nHome Screen and Lock Screen\nOn the Lock Screen, there are two key changes beyond design updates. The time can auto adjust to be larger when your wallpaper allows for more space, and there is an option to enable a 2D to 3D spatial photo effect that adds depth to your wallpaper images.\nThe size of the time adjusts automatically in some cases, but you can also drag the bar at the corner to resize it to make it bigger. Note that you need to use the first font in the font list, because it's the only one that can be resized.\nWhen choosing a photo for a wallpaper, there is an option to use a 2D image to generate a 3D \"Spatial Scene\" that uses depth information to separate the subject from the background. The Spatial Scene wallpaper features a little bit of motion when you move your iPad, enhancing the 3D effect.\nMost of the Home Screen is the same, aside from the Liquid Glass design changes. You can tap into Edit > Customize to select a new \"Clear\" option that gives all of your app icons a translucent, Liquid Glass look.\nMessages\nThe Messages app features customized backgrounds, an option to create polls, live translation, and enhanced spam filtering and blocking features.\n- Customizable backgrounds - In an individual or group conversation, you can tap on the name at the top and then choose the \"Backgrounds\" option to set a custom background for each conversation. There are options like sky, water, and aurora, or you can choose a color. You can also select photos or generate a background with Image Playground. Backgrounds that you set are changed for every participant in the conversation, unless they toggle off the feature in Messages settings.\n- Polls - Tap on the \"+\" button to get to a new option to create a poll in any chat. You can add up to 12 different options, then send it to allow people to vote. Others can also add options to the list. On devices with Apple Intelligence, polls may come up as a suggestion.\n- Group chats - Group chats support typing indicators and sending and receiving Apple Cash. There's also an option to add someone in a group chat who isn't in your contacts to your Contacts app with a tap.\n- Natural language search - Messages supports natural language search.\n- Copy/paste - You can now select just part of a text message to copy.

      "text": "iOS 26\nApple's next-generation operating system for the iPhone, coming in fall 2025.\niOS 26 - What's New\nContents\n- iOS 26 - What's New\n- iOS 18 to iOS 26\n- Design Changes\n- Home Screen and Lock Screen\n- Messages\n- Phone\n- Apple Music\n- Shortcuts\n- Other New App Features\n- CarPlay\n- Battery and Adaptive Power Mode\n- Apple Intelligence Updates\n- New AirPods Features\n- Smaller Changes\n- Accessibility\n- Compatibility\n- iOS 26 Launch Date\n- What's Next for iOS\n- iOS 26 Timeline\niOS 26 is the newest version of iOS, the operating system that runs on the iPhone, and it's coming this fall. If you were expecting iOS 19 after iOS 18, you might be a little surprised to see Apple jump to iOS 26, but the new number reflects the 2025-2026 release season for the software update. It also lets Apple use the same number across all of its updates, so there's no more confusion since you're no longer downloading iOS, macOS, visionOS, and watchOS all with different numbers.\niOS 26 brings the first new major design change that Apple has brought to iOS since iOS 7. Apple says that the new \"Liquid Glass\" look will be the basis of the next decade of iOS design. Liquid Glass reflects and refracts its surroundings, while putting more focus on content. Many interface elements are almost entirely translucent, and the design extends to controls, navigation, app icons, menus, buttons, and widgets.\nLiquid Glass is meant to transform depending on content or context, and it behaves like glass in the real world, so color is informed by its surroundings, and it is meant to adapt between light and dark elements. Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering and can dynamically react to movement to change the way that light reflects off of buttons, switches, sliders, side bars, tab bars, and more.\nYou'll see Liquid Glass throughout iOS 26, in all of Apple's apps, in notifications, on the Lock Screen, in Control Center, and on the Home Screen. Apple is also providing developers with tools to bring the new material to their own apps for a cohesive look. Liquid Glass also extends to iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe, visionOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26.\nThe Liquid Glass design overhaul isn't just a glossy finish, it also brings updates to the design of controls, toolbars, and navigation throughout iOS 26. App windows, menu bars, and other interface elements have more rounded corners, and controls feature a distinct functional layer designed to sit above apps. These kinds of menus can dynamically morph to provide users with more options in an app.\nWhen scrolling, tab bars shrink down to bring attention to content, but scrolling up brings them right back for fluid navigation. When tab bars are active, they refract the content around them. There are major Liquid Glass design updates for Camera, Photos, Safari, FaceTime, Apple Music, and Apple Podcasts. On the Lock Screen, the Liquid Glass time expands and shrinks to fit behind the subject of a wallpaper, and on the Home Screen, app icons and widgets are made from multiple layers of Liquid Glass that gives the appearance of depth.\nThe Lock Screen features a spatial scene option for photo wallpapers, giving them a 3D look and a sense of movement. The Home Screen might look different with an option for translucent icons and widgets, but it is functionally the same.\nApple streamlined the Camera app layout with simpler navigation. It has Photo and Video toggles, with other options tucked away behind menus that expand out with a tap. You can swipe to get to more photo and video options. Apple also updated the Photos app to re-add separate tabs for the Library and Collections views. In Photos, you can also activate Spatial Scene for any image, getting a unique 3D view of the image.\nSafari has a whole new look, and Apple has updated navigation. By default, Safari adopts the more rounded Liquid Glass buttons and nixes the settings at the bottom of the app, but there's an option to bring them back with a floating tab bar if you prefer a more feature rich menu. Apple Music, News, and Podcasts all have a new tab bar that floats above the content in the app and dynamically shrinks when users are browsing, so the interface options take up less space on the display.\nAlong with a new design, Apple is expanding the Apple Intelligence features that are available on the iPhone. Messages, FaceTime, and Phone all support Live Translation for automatically translating conversations when you're conversing with someone who speaks another language.\nVisual Intelligence now understands what's on your screen, and can answer questions about what you're looking at using ChatGPT integration. The feature can help you find products, add events to your calendar, and more. Image Playground supports ChatGPT image generation so you can create images in more styles. Genmoji has a new feature for mixing multiple emoji characters to make a new one, and adding descriptions to create an all-new emoji character.\nIn the Wallet app, there's a new Apple Intelligence feature that can scan your emails to summarize order tracking details from merchants, even if you didn't make the purchase with Apple Pay. It lets you see all your purchases and their tracking info in one spot. Wallet also now supports paying with installments in stores and getting rewards on in-store purchases. Boarding passes in Wallet support Live Activities for real-time flight tracking, and include access to Maps and Find My.\nThe Shortcuts app supports intelligent actions that can summarize text, create images, or tap into Apple Intelligence models, making it easier than ever to create automations. Reminders is able to suggest tasks, grocery items and follow-ups based on emails, and it can automatically categorize related reminders into sections.\nFor developers, Apple is debuting a new Foundation Models framework that allows developers to tap into the AI model that's at the core of Apple Intelligence, so developers can add new AI features to their apps.\nThe Phone app has a whole slew of new features. There's a unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails. A new Call Screening feature asks unknown callers for their name and reason for calling before sending the call to you, stopping unwanted calls. When you're stuck on hold, there's a Hold Assist option that stays on the line for you, so you don't have to listen to irritating hold music. It lets you know when a live agent is available.\nMessages can screen texts from unknown senders, sending them silently to a dedicated folder where users can ask for more information or delete them. Group texts now have typing indicators and support for sending and receiving Apple Cash, plus Messages adds customizable backgrounds for each conversation and polls.\nIn Apple Music, there's a Lyrics Translation feature that translates lyrics that aren't in your language, and Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce those lyrics. A new AutoMix feature uses intelligence to transition from one song to another, using time stretching and beat matching for a seamless shift between songs.\nApple Maps supports Visited Places so you can remember where you've been, and on-device intelligence can understand your daily route, popping up your preferred routes and letting you know about potential delays and alternate route options.\nApple added a new Apple Games app that's an all-in-one destination for discovering and playing games. It supports recommendations, leaderboards, competitions with friends, and more.\nCarPlay is getting the same Liquid Glass design overhaul, along with widgets and Live Activities that sync from the iPhone. There are Tapback options, important conversations can be pinned, and Apple added a new compact view for incoming calls so directions aren't blocked.\nIn iOS 26, AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 support studio-quality sound recording and improved sound for calls and videos. The AirPods can also be used to take a photo or record a video with a press on the stem. For battery management, there's a new Adaptive Power setting on the iPhone that intelligently determines when you're using more battery than normal and adjusts things like screen brightness to preserve battery life.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\niOS 18 to iOS 26\nIf you're wondering why Apple went from iOS 18 to iOS 26, it was to streamline operating system naming. Apple is numbering all of its operating systems with the year going forward, so the \"26\" in iOS 26 represents the release season between September 2025 and September 2026.\nEverything released this year uses the same number, so iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and so on. It will help keep numbering more straightforward in the future, even if it seems strange to skip iOS 19 to iOS 26.\nDesign Changes\nThe biggest single change in iOS 26 is the design overhaul. Apple is using a new Liquid Glass material throughout the operating system, and it has transformed the look of the iPhone's software.\nLiquid Glass is translucent, and like real glass, it allows light and color to shine through to put the focus on the content that's on your iPhone's display. Apple designed Liquid Glass to behave like it does in the real world, so it can subtly reflect light when you move your iPhone. It uses real-time rendering to dynamically react to movement with reflective highlights.\nApp icons are meant to look like several layers of glass, which gives them a subtle depth. Liquid Glass works well for the standard color icons, but Apple also added a translucent app icon option that makes your iPhone look even more like a sheet of glass.\nThere are actually two main aspects to the iOS 26 redesign: the Liquid Glass look, and simplified navigation that highlights the Liquid Glass material. There are too many cosmetic changes in iOS 26 to go through each one, but there is an overarching design language that Apple adopted.\nIt is worth noting that while iOS 26 looks different, it still feels like prior versions of iOS. Apple wanted it to be familiar to iOS users despite the changes, so menus, bars, and buttons look different and do have some different functions, but they are functions that iPhone users are already familiar with.\nPop Out Menus\nIn several places, Apple streamlined navigation and moved extra settings into pop out menus. In the Camera app, for example, Apple shows just the two main modes: photo and video. But if you tap on one of the buttons, you'll see a pop out menu with a range of photo settings that you can activate.\nApple says it wanted controls, toolbars, and navigation to have a distinct functional layer that sits above apps, morphing and dynamically changing as users need more options.\nThis kind of menu is common in iOS 26, so if there's something that you can't find, tap on one of the small icons on the screen, because chances are the menu expands out with more options.\nDisappearing Navigation\nIn several places, navigation elements disappear when they're not needed, and appear when they are. An example of this is in Safari. When you scroll down, the tab bar will collapse down into a small bar that shows just the name of the website. Scrolling back up brings back the full Safari tab bar so you can use the interface buttons that you need.\nIn Photos and Apple Music, there's an expanding search bar. Tapping it unfurls into a full search menu and collapses the other navigation bar menu options. Tapping out of search and on one of the other icons collapses search again and the menu bar returns to how it was. This is similar to the pop out menus, with an emphasis on putting things you don't need out of sight until you want to use them.\nThere are other examples of this, too. In the Health app, you won't see Health categories anymore until you tap on the search icon. That swaps to the search and categories interface, and a swap back is done by tapping on the heart to get back to your pinned items.\nCorners and Spacing\nIn areas with a long list of options or categories, such as the Settings app, Apple has increased spacing and padding for a less cluttered look. You will need to scroll longer to get through settings now, but there's more space to tap and it can be more readable with the additional spacing.\nApple shrunk navigation bars at the bottom of apps, so they take up less display space. A good example of this is in the Photos app, where the editing options have been condensed down into a smaller bar.\nNavigation bars, side bars, card-style menus, notifications, buttons, toggles, search bars, and other interface elements have a more rounded look. Single buttons are entirely circular, such as those in Control Center, while navigation bars are pill-shaped with distinctly round corners. Toggles and notifications have an elongated pill-shape too, and cards are also more rounded in appearance at the corners. The keyboard has round edges at the top.\niOS 18 had more of a squircle (rounded square) shape for much of the interface, but almost everything in iOS 26 is round. An exception is app icons, which have not changed in shape.\nCross-Platform Cohesiveness\nLiquid Glass is not exclusive to iOS 26. The new design extends to all of Apple's operating systems, including iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and of course, visionOS 26, which is the OS that inspired the overhaul.\nWith the same design available across all of Apple's operating systems, everything feels more cohesive, which was one of Apple's main goals with Liquid Glass.\nDesign Summary\n- Everything looks different in iOS 26.\n- There's an emphasis on content, with Apple aiming to make everything else fade away.\n- Interface elements are made from Liquid Glass, which is translucent and designed to work like glass in the real world. Colors and content shine through, and everything has a more liquid feel.\n- Almost all interface elements are rounder.\n- Navigation elements and settings are meant to hide away when you don't need them. If you're missing a setting, it's likely you'll find it in a pop out menu when you tap on a single icon.\n- Liquid Glass is system wide. Apple's apps have been redesigned with it to varying degrees, and third-party apps will also adopt the design language.\nHome Screen and Lock Screen\nOn the Lock Screen, there are two key changes beyond design updates. The time can auto adjust to be larger when your wallpaper allows for more space, and there is an option to enable a 2D to 3D spatial photo effect that adds depth to your wallpaper images.\nThe size of the time adjusts automatically in some cases, but you can also drag the bar at the corner to resize it to make it bigger. Note that you need to use the first font in the font list, because it's the only one that can be resized.\nWhen choosing a photo for a wallpaper, there is an option to use a 2D image to generate a 3D \"Spatial Scene\" that uses depth information to separate the subject from the background. The Spatial Scene wallpaper will feature a little bit of motion when you move your iPhone, enhancing the 3D effect.\nMost of the Home Screen is the same, aside from the Liquid Glass design changes. You can tap into Edit > Customize to select a new \"Clear\" option that gives all of your app icons a translucent, Liquid Glass look.\nMessages\nThe Messages app features customized backgrounds, an option to create polls, and enhanced spam filtering and blocking features.\n- Customizable backgrounds - In an individual or group conversation, you can tap on the name at the top and then choose the \"Backgrounds\" option to set a custom background for each conversation. There are options like sky, water, and aurora, or you can choose a color. You can also select photos or generate a background with Image Playground. Backgrounds that you set are changed for every participant in the conversation, unless they toggle off the feature in Messages settings.\n- Polls - Tap on the \"+\" button to get to a new option to create a poll in any chat. You can add up to 12 different options, then send it to allow people to vote. Others can also add options to the list. On devices with Apple Intelligence, polls may come up as a suggestion.\n- Group chats - Group chats support typing indicators and sending and receiving Apple Cash. There's also an option to add someone in a group chat who isn't in your contacts to your Contacts app with a tap.\n- Natural language search - Messages supports natural language search.\n- Copy/paste - You can now select just part of a text message to copy. Long press and tap on the new \"Select\" option to do so.\n- Spam messages - Spam messages and Unknown Senders are two separate categories in iOS 26. There's a new Filter box at the top right of the Messages app, and Unknown Senders go in one category, while Spam goes in another. A badge lets you know if you have messages in these categories, but you won't get notifications for them.\n- Unknown Senders - Messages from Unknown Senders won't send notifications if the option to filter them is on, but you will get alerts if it is a time sensitive notification, such as a notification from a ride share app or a delivery person.\n- Live Translation - Messages that aren't in your language can be automatically translated as you receive them in iOS 26. Apple Intelligence is required for this feature.\nPhone\nThe Phone app includes multiple new features that are designed to cut down on unwanted calls and reduce the amount of time that you need to spend on the phone.\nCall Screening\nCall Screening is an extension of Live Voicemail. When you receive a call from an unknown number that is not in your list of contacts, your iPhone asks the caller for their name and reason for calling. The information is relayed to you so you can decide if you want to accept the call or ignore it.\nCall Screening can be enabled in the Phone section of the Settings app.\nHold Assist\nIf you make a phone call and you're stuck on hold waiting to speak to a person, you can activate Hold Assist. Your iPhone can wait for you while you do other things, and then let you know when a live agent is on the line. The agent is informed that you'll be on the call in just a moment.\nTo use Hold Assist, tap on the \"Hold\" button after placing a call.\nLive Translation\nWhen talking to someone that speaks another language, there is an option to turn on Live Translation to have the call automatically translated for each person on the line. Live Translation is an Apple Intelligence feature and requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later.\nOther Features\n- Unified Layout - The Phone app has an optional unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails in one spot.\n- Spam calls - Calls identified as spam can be silenced and sent directly to voicemail.\n- Type to Siri - You can now use Type to Siri while on a phone call.\n- Call History - Tapping on the info button next to a call in the recents list or on a name or number in the unified view shows a call history that lists every time you've spoken with someone.\n- Flag spam voicemails - If you tap into a voicemail from a person not in your contact list, you'll see an option to report the voicemail as spam.\n- eSIM transfer - It's easier to transfer an eSIM to an Android device and vice versa with new integrated eSIM transfer capabilities.\n- Focus eSIM - There is a Focus mode for silencing a single eSIM, so you can disable a home number at work, or a work number at home.\n- Screen sharing - The Phone app supports screen sharing and SharePlay during phone calls.\nApple Music\nThere are several new Apple Music features, ranging from translation to new options for transitioning between songs.\nAutoMix\nApple Music includes AutoMix, a feature that transitions from one song to another as the song that's playing ends. It uses time stretching and beat mixing for a seamless shift, and Apple says that it's meant to work like a DJ.\nSongs transition at the \"perfect moment\" based on an analysis of the key and tempo of the music, with AutoMix serving as an alternative to Crossfade.\nOther New Features\n- Lyrics Translation - Songs that are in another language can be translated automatically with Lyrics Translation.\n- Lyrics Pronunciation - Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce lyrics that are in another language.\n- Pinned playlists - Apple Music playlists can now be pinned to the top of the Music app, with pinned playlists available in a new Home Screen widget as well.\n- Playlist folders - Playlists can be organized into folders.\n- iPhone microphone - When using the Apple Music Sing karaoke feature on Apple TV, the iPhone can be used as a microphone.\n- Lock Screen - On the Lock Screen, the Now Playing widget now provides full screen album artwork. Album art animates based on what you're listening to.\nShortcuts\nThe Shortcuts app now features Apple Intelligence, and the option to use Apple's AI models when creating shortcuts. Apple Intelligence models can be used for summarizing PDFs, generating recipes, answering questions, and more. Writing Tools and Image Playground are available for spellchecking, image generation, rewriting, tone changes, and more.\nApple offers several pre-programmed Shortcuts in the Gallery that use Apple Intelligence, such as options for getting a morning summary of the coming day, generating a haiku, or summarizing a PDF.\nWhen creating a shortcut, there is an Apple Intelligence section that includes options for an on-device model, a cloud model that uses Private Cloud Compute, or ChatGPT. Some pre-set options are available, such as opening Visual Intelligence, generating an image with Image Playground, or using Writing Tools, along with the option to use a model.\nSelecting one of the AI models provides an open-ended prompt where you can write in what you want it to do. You need to work in the confines of the model that Apple provides, pairing it with other functionality in Shortcuts.\nOther New App Features\nSafari\n- Tab View - Safari has a new \"Compact\" view for the Tab bar that puts several settings out of sight. You can change back to the standard bottom bar or top bar in the Safari section of the Settings app.\n- Liquid Glass - When scrolling, the Tab bar collapses down. Scroll up to bring it back.\n- Tracking Prevention - Advanced fingerprinting protection extends to all browsing by default. Advanced fingerprinting protection prevents websites from tracking your device usage across websites. Previously, this was limited to private browsing unless explicitly enabled.\n- Web apps - Every website added to the Home Screen through Safari opens a web app, even if it is not configured that way. In earlier versions of iOS, websites added to the Home Screen that were not properly configured would open in Safari.\n- HDR images - Safari supports HDR images in iOS 26.\n- SVG icons - Safari supports the SVG file format for icons in the bookmark bar and start page.\nCamera\n- Design - The Camera app has a simplified design with just Photo and Video tabs. Swiping swaps to other photo modes, and tapping on one of the buttons expands the available settings.\n- Lens - If the Camera lens is dirty, your iPhone lets you know that it needs to be cleaned.\n- AirPods - The AirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 2 can be used to take a photo or start a video recording by pressing and holding on the stem.\nPhotos\n- Design - Apple reverted to a more pre-iOS 18 design for Photos, separating the Library and Collections into different tabs.\n- Search - Video thumbnails show up in search results.\n- Spatial Scenes - You can use a new 3D feature to turn 2D photos into 3D images, adding subtle depth and motion that separates the subject from the background.\nNotes\n- Markdown - The Notes app supports exporting in Markdown.\n- Math Notes - Three-variable equations can be used to create 3D graphs.\nReminders\n- Categorization - Apple Intelligence can categorize reminders into different sections.\n- Suggestions - Apple Intelligence can suggest adding tasks, grocery items, and more to Reminders based on what's on your iPhone.\nFaceTime\n- Live Translation - FaceTime supports Live Translation, displaying captions if you're talking to someone who speaks another language.\n- Call Screening - FaceTime has new screening features for unknown numbers. Calls from unknown numbers can be asked for more information like name and reason for calling, or they can be sent directly to voicemail. Missed calls from unknown numbers can be silenced and sent to an Unknown Callers list.\nPodcasts\n- Enhance Dialogue - An Enhance Dialogue option mutes background sounds to enhance speech.\n- Playback speed - There are more options for playback speeds, ranging from 0.5x to 3x.\nApple Maps\n- Preferred Routes - Apple Maps learns your frequent commutes and the Maps widget can let you know if there are any significant delays along your preferred route, offering an alternative if necessary.\n- Saved Places - Apple Maps can save the places that you visit and spend time in so you can look them up later.\n- Incidents - There are additional types of incidents to choose from when making a report in the Maps app.\nWallet\nThere is an option to add a passport to the Wallet app, which creates a \"Digital ID\" that can be used at select TSA checkpoints in the United States.\nA new \"Verify with Wallet on the Web\" option allows websites to use the license or ID you have stored in the Wallet app for age and identity verification purposes. The process involves scanning a QR code with the iPhone and then authenticating, so it works in Safari and all other web browsers, too. It also works on non-Apple devices.\n- Package tracking - Apple Intelligence can recognize order tracking details from emails, adding the information to the Wallet app. This works on all purchases, not just those that were made using Apple Pay.\n- Boarding Passes - Boarding passes in Wallet have been upgraded and now show relevant information below the boarding pass, like Apple Maps directions for the airport terminal, and a link to Find My for luggage tracking.\n- Live Activity - Boarding passes now show up as a Live Activity on iPhone, so you can keep track of relevant flight information without having to open the Wallet app. Flight Live Activities can be shared with friends and family.\n- AutoFill Credit Cards - You can add and remove credit cards and debit cards that work with AutoFill from the Wallet app.\n- Apple Pay - Apple Pay supports rewards and installments for in-store purchases.\nGames\niOS 26 includes a Games app that comes pre-installed on the iPhone. It has all of the games from the App Store, along with Apple Arcade titles.\nGames you have installed are shown in a Library section. A Play Together section lets you invite friends to \"Challenges,\" where you compete to win in a game-specific task like getting the highest score during a given week.\nPreview\nThe Mac Preview app is now available on the iPhone and the iPad. It can be used for creating, viewing, and annotating PDFs. There are also tools for cropping, flipping, rotating, resizing, and editing images.\nJournal\n- Multiple Journals - You can now create more than one journal if you want to separate your entries by topic.\n- Maps - Journal entries can be viewed on a map.\n- Images - There's support for adding images inline with text.\nCarPlay\nCarPlay has been updated with the same Liquid Glass design that Apple added to iOS 26. The look includes layered glass-like app icons and translucent user interface elements.\nNew Messages App Features\nStarting with iOS 26, you can respond to messages with standard Tapbacks like a heart, thumbs up, or exclamation marks directly through CarPlay.\nCarPlay also now displays pinned conversations in the Messages app.\nPhone Calls\nApple added a compact view for incoming phone calls, so that you can still see other information on the screen, such as turn-by-turn directions.\nLive Activities and Widgets\nCarPlay's Dashboard screen can now show Live Activities, letting you keep track of things like a flight's arrival time at a glance.\nThe regular version of CarPlay also now has a widgets screen, for things like calendar appointments and HomeKit accessory controls.\nOther New Features\n- Multi-Touch Maps - Starting with iOS 26, CarPlay users can interact with mapping apps using multi-touch gestures in supported vehicles. This allows users to zoom and pan on the map with their fingers, just like they can on an iPhone.\n- Watch Videos While Parked - iPhone users can wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback. Automakers need to add support for this feature, so it might be limited to newer vehicles and take some time to roll out.\n- Smart Display Zoom - iOS 26 adds a new Smart Display Zoom setting to CarPlay. When the setting is enabled, CarPlay will be automatically resized to better fit the shape and size of your vehicle's dashboard screen, if possible.\nBattery and Adaptive Power Mode\nApple updated the Battery section of the Settings app to provide a more in-depth look at how iPhone usage impacts battery life, and how much battery apps are draining.\nThe Battery section now displays a weekly view of battery usage along with a comparison of how much battery you're currently using compared to your typical average. You can see if you're using more, the same, or less battery life than you do on most days, with a readout of which apps are using the most battery, and by how much.\nApp battery usage includes specific details, such as letting you know if an app ran in the background longer, was on your screen longer, or sent more notifications than normal. You'll also see how much battery you've used since your last charge.\nApple also added an Adaptive Power mode that detects when iPhone usage is higher than normal and makes small performance adjustments like lowering display brightness or allowing certain background activities to take longer to extend battery life. Adaptive Power Mode is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro models and newer because it uses Apple Intelligence.\nOn the Lock Screen and in the Battery section, you'll see information on how long it will take your iPhone to charge up to full when it's plugged in.\nApple Intelligence Updates\nThere are new Apple Intelligence features throughout iOS 26, such as the Live Translation options in Phone, Messages, and FaceTime, and the suggestions and sorting options in the Reminders app. Some existing Apple Intelligence features have also been updated.\nVisual Intelligence\nIn iOS 26, Visual Intelligence works with screenshots for the first time. You can capture a screenshot of what's on your screen and then use Visual Intelligence on it to identify what you're looking at, find images, and get more information through ChatGPT.\nThere's a Highlight to Search option that lets you conduct an image search for a specific object in a screenshot, even if there are multiple things in the picture. It works with the apps that you use most frequently, like Google Search, Etsy, and others, and the feature is useful for finding a product in an image.\nIf you don't need to isolate one object in your screenshot, you can simply tap on the Ask button to ask questions about what you're seeing. Questions will be relayed to ChatGPT, and ChatGPT will provide the information. The Search button queries Google Search for more information.\nAs with the standard Visual Search, if your screenshot includes dates, times, and related information for an event, it can be added directly to your calendar.\nVisual Intelligence also adds support for quick identification of new types of objects. It can now identify art, books, landmarks, natural landmarks, and sculptures, in addition to the animals and plants it was able to provide information on before.\nGenmoji\nGenmoji supports combining two or more emoji together to create a new character. You can also combine existing emoji with text-based descriptions to tweak them, which is a more convenient starting point for generating something new.\nImage Playground\nApple added support for ChatGPT image generation capabilities, which means you can use several ChatGPT image styles when generating images. Options include Anime, Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, and Print.\nThere's also an open-ended option where you can tell ChatGPT what style you want, and you can make realistic images with this option. The new ChatGPT styles join the existing Animation, Sketch, and Illustration styles.\nNote that generating images with ChatGPT is limited if you do not have a ChatGPT subscription, so you cannot freely use the ChatGPT styles.\nChatGPT\nWith iOS 26, the ChatGPT Siri integration will use OpenAI's new GPT-5 model rather than GPT-4.\nGPT-5 brings enhanced reasoning capabilities and coding tools, along with better voice interaction and video perception.\nNew AirPods Features\niOS 26 adds several new features to the AirPods Pro 2 and the AirPods 4 through an accompanying AirPods firmware update.\nImproved Call Quality\nThe studio-quality recording feature brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to iPhone calls, FaceTime calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.\nBoth studio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.\nCamera Remote\nThe AirPods can be used as a camera remote with the Camera app and third-party camera apps on iPhone or iPad. Just press and hold on the AirPods stem to take a photo or start a video recording.\nWhen the recording is finished, a press and hold gesture will stop the recording. Apple says that users who like to capture themselves singing and dancing for social networks like TikTok will be able to easily perform in sync with a soundtrack while simultaneously recording video.\nSoftware Updates\nWith the latest software updates, Apple is finally adding a way to manually update the firmware on your AirPods. When your AirPods are connected, you can go to the Settings app to get to a new software update interface.\nPause for Sleep\nIf you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods will pause your audio when you fall asleep.\nRead More\nSmaller Changes\nThere are dozens if not hundreds of smaller changes in iOS 26, and we've highlighted some of the more notable ones below.\n- Custom Ringtones - You can set custom ringtones in iOS 26 without using GarageBand.
