  "description": "At the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas on Friday, Nakasone tried to thread the needle in a politically fraught moment while hinting at major changes for the tech community around the corner.",
  "content": "The Trump administration's radical changes to United States fiscal policy, foreign relations, and global strategy\u2014combined with mass firings across the federal government\u2014have created uncertainty around US cybersecurity priorities that was on display this week at two of the country's most prominent digital security conferences in Las Vegas. \u201cWe are not retreating, we're advancing in a new direction,\u201d Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency chief information officer Robert Costello said on Thursday during a critical infrastructure defense panel at Black Hat.\n\nAs in other parts of the federal government, the Trump administration has been combing intelligence and cybersecurity agencies to remove officials seen as disloyal to its agenda. Alongside these shifts, the White House has also been hostile to former US cybersecurity officials. In April, for example, Trump specifically directed all departments and agencies to revoke the security clearance of former CISA director Chris Krebs. And last week, following criticism from far-right activist Laura Loomer, the secretary of the Army rescinded an academic appointment that former CISA director Jen Easterly had been scheduled to fill at West Point. Amid all of this, former US National Security Agency and Cyber Command chief Paul Nakasone spoke with Defcon founder Jeff Moss in an onstage discussion on Friday, focusing on AI, cybercrime, and the importance of partnerships in digital defense.\n\n\u201cI think we've entered a space now in the world where technology has become political and basically every one of us is conflicted,\u201d Moss said at the beginning of the discussion. Nakasone, who is on the board of OpenAI, agreed, citing Trump's January launch of the \u201cStargate\u201d AI infrastructure initiative flanked by Oracle's Larry Ellison, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, and OpenAI's Sam Altman. \u201cAnd then two days later, just by chance, [the Chinese generative AI platform] DeepSeek came out,\u201d Nakasone deadpanned. \u201cAmazing.\u201d\n\nNakasone also reflected on demographic differences between the US federal government and the tech sector.\n\n\u201cWhen I was the director of NSA and commander of US Cyber Command, every single quarter I would go to the Bay or I'd go to Texas or Boston or other places to see technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every place that I went to, I was twice the age of the people that talked to me. And then when I came back to DC and I sat at the table, I was one of the younger people there. OK, that's a problem. That's a problem for our nation.\u201d\n\nThroughout the discussion, Nakasone largely geared his remarks toward efforts to counter traditional US rivals and adversaries, including China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, as well as specific digital threats.\n\n\u201cWhy aren't we thinking differently about ransomware, which I think right now is among the great scourges that we have in our country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not making progress against ransomware.\u201d\n\nAt times, though, Moss attempted to steer the conversation toward geopolitical changes and conflicts around the world that are fueling uncertainty and fear.\n\n\u201cHow do you be neutral in this environment? Can you be neutral? Or is the world's environment since last year, Ukraine, Israel, Russia, Iran, just take your pick, America\u2014how does anybody remain neutral?\" Moss asked at the beginning of the conversation. Later he added, \u201cI think because I'm so stressed out by the chaos of the situation, I'm trying to feel how do I get control?\u201d\n\nReferencing these remarks and comments Moss had made about turning to open source software platforms as a community-building alternative to multinational tech companies, Nakasone hinted at Moss' notion that the world and its entering a precarious state of flux.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be an interesting storyline that we play out through \u201825 and \u201926. When we come back [to Defcon] next year to have this discussion, will we still be able to have this sense of, oh, we're truly neutral? I sense not. I think it's going to be very, very difficult.\u201d",

      "text": "The National Science Foundation fired nearly 170 workers in a Zoom call on Tuesday morning as part of the Trump administration\u2019s agenda to reduce the federal workforce. The terminated workers, who were told their employment would end at 5 pm EST today, included those still under probation, but also workers who had already completed the requisite one-year probationary period to become permanent workers and at-will workers who were considered permanent employees.\nEarlier this month, however, these permanent workers were suddenly told by NSF that their one-year probationary period should have been two years and they were no longer safe from being terminated.\nThe Trump administration has ordered federal agencies to fire nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained permanent status, thereby receiving civil service protections. But NSF workers who believed they were safe suddenly found themselves without jobs today.\nThe National Science Foundation is an independent agency within the federal government that provides grants to universities and other bodies in support of scientific and engineering research. The foundation\u2019s grants account for about a quarter of all federal support to academic institutions for research. NSF\u2019s grants were paused in late January due to a funding freeze, but the agency resumed issuing grants following a court order early this month.\nMany of the people terminated on Tuesday work as program managers and experts who make decisions about funding by aligning research proposals with the right program and matching those proposals to the most qualified reviewers to assess them and make recommendations.\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine this being accomplished successfully with automated algorithms,\u201d one fired program manager told WIRED. \u201cWith fewer program officers to steward the evaluation process, the overwhelming concern is that it will become harder to identify and support the transformative but unconventional projects that could otherwise be game changers in terms of advancing scientific progress in the USA.\u201d\nAll sources who spoke with WIRED requested anonymity for fear of retribution.\nSources say 168 workers received an email at 9:02 am EST this morning requesting their presence at a 10 am Zoom call for a \u201cMeeting with NSF probationary employees.\u201d Many workers did not receive the Zoom link, however, and missed the start of the call. At the meeting, they were told that their network access would be shut out at 1 pm and they had until 5 pm to clear out their desks, though workers were told that accommodations would be made to obtain things they weren\u2019t able to clear out by 5 pm.\nThe termination action this morning also included all permanent employees who were designated as \u201cat-will\u201d workers. One terminated worker tells WIRED that they were a permanent federal employee working on a part-time basis, with an annual contract that was up for renewal in September.\nThe decision to terminate at-will employees came from NSF alone, not from the administration, NSF management told workers during the meeting. When asked whether at-will employees were just terminated out of fairness to the probationary workers, NSF management replied that the decision was \u201cpartly due to fairness, but that\u2019s not all.\u201d\nThe source says management then indicated that this was just the first step in subsequent termination rounds. The worker said they understood from this that the NSF believed at-will workers would be targeted in a subsequent round anyway, so they decided to terminate those workers now as well.\nThe fired program manager who spoke with WIRED came to NSF from academia on a temporary rotation position. Rotationary workers are those who work for a university but spend some of their time working for the NSF for a specific period. When a permanent position suddenly opened up during the worker\u2019s rotation, NSF asked the worker to apply for it. They were hired in the summer of 2023 as a program manager, with a one-year trial period that ended in the summer of 2024. Paperwork that the worker shared with WIRED showed that the worker became a permanent employee at that time. But the worker says they and others were suddenly told recently that NSF had made a mistake.\nDuring the Tuesday Zoom call, the worker says, staff from NSF human resources seemed to indicate they had been caught off guard by the decision. \u201cThey were watching their words carefully,\u201d the worker says. \u201cMy sense is that they were caught unawares and probably somebody pointed to some federal statute somewhere that made them rethink how they had been doing things in the past.\u201d\nThe program manager says management and HR personnel told workers on the call that they believed the foundation had discretion to decide the probationary period but were recently told that the foundation did not have that discretion and that the probationary period should have been two years for all workers.\nNot everyone still on that probationary period got fired on Tuesday. The source tells WIRED that some workers who were very close to completing two years were not included in the terminations today. But workers were told that today\u2019s action was just the first in what will be other termination actions at the foundation.\n\u201cThere were exceptions made for people who were very close to completing their two-year period,\u201d the worker says.\nThe temporary rotation worker and other workers at NSF were told in January that they could accept the so-called fork-in-the-road resignation deal that would allow them to continue to draw a salary through September if they resigned their positions, but the worker says that because he had completed his probationary period he believed his job was safe. Once they were told that the probationary period was in question, he says, he had only a couple of days to decide about the buyout, but the union had advised workers to not take it. Now he says his life and the lives of other workers have been thrown into chaos.\nThe at-will worker says that during a question-and-answer portion of the Zoom call, several workers brought up the fact that federal agencies were supposed to condition the terminations based on merit, but this didn\u2019t seem to be happening. Workers have been receiving termination letters from the Office of Personnel Management saying that the government has determined they or their position no longer has value to the government.\n\u201cThere were a number of employees who commented that they had nothing but exemplary performance reviews and director awards for meritorious services, so this notion that they were being let go [for poor performance] was ludicrous,\u201d they said. \u201cThe answer was that they were simply copying the verbiage from OPM and that their value to the nation is no longer required.\u201d"

      "text": "Dozens of Consumer Finance Protection Bureau employees were terminated on Tuesday evening, sources tell WIRED.\nThe cuts largely targeted contractors and so-called probationary employees, workers who have served less than two years at the agency. Sources tell WIRED that the CFPB\u2019s enforcement division was hit hard, but it\u2019s unclear how many employees were let go.\nWorkers were informed that they had been fired with a frenetic email delivered around 9 pm ET on Tuesday. An evidently failed mail merge meant that some affected employees were addressed as [EmployeeFirstName][EmployeeLastName], [Job Title], [Division].\n\u201cThis is to provide notification that I am removing you from your position of [Job Title] and federal service consistent with the above references,\u201d the email from acting chief human capital officer Adam Martinez says. \u201cUnfortunately, the Agency finds that that [sic] you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d\nThe firings follow a tumultuous few days at the CFPB. On Friday, staff for Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency shut down a portion of the agency\u2019s homepage after a day of struggling to obtain access to the CMS and other systems. WIRED reported last week that three DOGE staffers, including Gavin Kliger and Nikhil Rajpal, were given access to the CFPB\u2019s HR, procurement, and financial infrastructure. The DOGE workers were later granted access to all of the agency\u2019s systems on Friday, Bloomberg reported this week, including bank examination and enforcement records.\nLater on Friday evening, Russell Vought\u2014President Trump\u2019s newly confirmed director of the Office of Management and Budget\u2014took over as the acting administrator for the CFPB late Friday evening, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Soon after, DOGE staff began sending out email requests asking CFPB managers to give Kliger additional access to agency systems, including physical access control system, payroll processing systems, and the ability to edit the CFPB\u2019s website, sources tell WIRED.\nJust before 10:30 pm ET on Friday, sources say, someone who appeared to have administrative privileges accessed the agency server using Secure Shell, a protocol that allows remote control of a computer over a network. Bypassing the content management system, they unpublished the homepage file, causing a portion of the CFPB homepage to display a \u201c404: Page not found\u201d notice typical of a website that has been deleted or is otherwise missing. The remainder of the site was functional, including submission forms for industry whistleblowers and consumer complaints.\nAround 11 pm on Friday, the CFPB\u2019s X account disappeared, and shortly after, according to a CFPB staffer, DOGE left the building.\nCFPB sources who spoke to WIRED described being blindsided by the DOGE staffers. \"They said they would follow protocol but repeatedly did not,\" one says, noting that the level of access these staffers have could allow them to lock others out of the building, take down the website, and \u201cobstruct the bureau\u2019s ability to carry out its mandate.\u201d\n| Got a Tip? |\n|---|\n| Are you a current or former government worker with insight into what's going on? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely using a personal device on Signal at makenakelly.32 and dmehro.89. |\nOne source at CFPB on Friday says they saw two young DOGE staffers wandering through the halls of the building trying to open doors.\n\u201cDOGE pulled a Darth Vader in cloud city where they came in promising to respect our rules and ask for read access and then tonight [Friday] at 6 they took a heel turn and demanded website access,\u201d another CFPB source told WIRED at the time.\nIn a pair of emails sent Saturday and Monday, Vought effectively ordered all work at the agency to stop, freezing various enforcement efforts and work on regulations that would affect payment programs run by Big Tech companies.\nThe CFPB has long been a target of both Elon Musk and conservatives more broadly; the Project 2025 chapter on financial regulatory agencies describes it as \u201ca highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency\u201d and calls to have it abolished. Musk wrote \u201cRIP CFPB\u201d with a gravestone emoji in an X post Friday afternoon. In November, he posted \u201cDelete CFPB.\u201d There are around 1,700 employees in total at the agency.\nThe CFPB was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping piece of legislation that imposed significant regulatory reform in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Its remit is to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive financial practices, and the agency claims to be responsible for $19.7 billion in consumer relief since its inception, as well as $5 billion in civil penalties.\nSome of those wins have come against payment processors including Block, which last month was ordered to pay $175 million in penalties for allegedly failing to sufficiently protect users of its Cash App from fraud. The CFPB also has an active lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo for similar alleged failures on their shared payment app Zelle. Elon Musk will soon be in the peer-to-peer payments business as well, after X entered a partnership with Visa in late January."

      "text": "The Secretary of the Army on Wednesday directed the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to review its hiring practices.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Secretary of the Army on Wednesday directed the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to review its hiring practices, bar outside groups from choosing employees and remove a newly announced hire who led the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency under President Joe Biden.\nThe directive, shared on the social platform X by Secretary Dan Driscoll, came just a day after Jen Easterly was announced as the Robert F. McDermott Distinguished Chair in West Point\u2019s social sciences department.\nIt demonstrated how vigorously President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has sought to wield control over the ideology and leadership of higher education and the military during the president\u2019s second term.\nIt also highlighted how deeply concerns about censorship have seeped into the Republican Party and the Trump administration. As the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, Easterly faced harsh criticism from Republicans who argued that her work to counter misinformation about elections and the COVID-19 pandemic amounted to censorship.\nCISA secures the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, including the nation\u2019s dams, banks and nuclear power plants. It also secures voting systems \u2014 work that became controversial as Trump has made false claims to create doubt about the integrity of elections in recent years.\nEasterly has denied claims that her agency censored anyone and said last fall that \u201callegations against CISA are riddled with factual inaccuracies.\u201d She said in January she hopes the agency will be allowed to continue its election-related work despite \u201ccontentiousness\u201d around that part of its mission.\nDriscoll\u2019s directive came after far-right activist Laura Loomer posted about Easterly\u2019s new role on X, saying \u201cBiden holdovers\u201d at the Defense Department were \u201cundermining\u201d Trump\u2019s administration. Loomer has frequently urged Trump\u2019s administration to purge staffers she deems insufficiently loyal to his agenda, and on multiple occasions, they have been fired.\nThe memo directs West Point to terminate Easterly\u2019s agreement with the institution and \u201cimmediately pause non-governmental and outside groups from selecting employees of the Academy, including instructors, professors, teachers and shaping academic or developmental lectures.\u201d It also requests an immediate review of the military training academy\u2019s hiring practices.\nAsked for a reason for the memo, an Army spokesperson said in a statement that ahead of the new academic year, \u201cwe are crafting a deliberate approach to ensure that our future officers are best prepared to meet the demands of the modern battlefield.\u201d\nPentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell was more blunt about the reasoning in a post on X.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not turning cadets into censorship activists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re turning them into warriors & leaders. We\u2019re in the business of warfighting.\u201d\nEasterly, an Army combat veteran and West Point graduate, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n___\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The widespread layoff of Department of Agriculture scientists has thrown vital research into disarray, according to former and current employees of the agency. Scientists hit by the layoffs were working on projects to improve crops, defend against pests and disease, and understand the climate impact of farming practices. The layoffs also threaten to undermine billions of taxpayer dollars paid to farmers to support conservation practices, experts warn.\nThe USDA layoffs are part of the Trump administration\u2019s mass firing of federal employees, mainly targeting people who are in their probationary periods ahead of gaining full-time status, which for USDA scientists can be up to three years. The agency has not released exact firing figures, but they are estimated to include many hundreds of staff at critical scientific subagencies and a reported 3,400 employees in the Forest Service.\nEmployees were told of their firing in a blanket email sent on February 13 and seen by WIRED. \u201cThe Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest,\u201d the email says.\nOne laid-off employee described the weeks preceding the firing as \u201cchaos,\u201d as the USDA paused (in response to orders from the Trump administration) and then unpaused (in response to a court order) work connected to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)\u2014the landmark 2022 law passed under President Joe Biden that set aside large amounts of federal money for climate policies. \u201cIt was just pause, unpause, pause, unpause. After four or five business days of that, I\u2019m thinking, I literally can\u2019t get anything done,\u201d says the former employee, who worked on IRA-linked projects and asked to remain anonymous to protect them from retribution.\nThe IRA provided the USDA with $300 million to help with the quantification of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. This money was intended to support the $8.45 billion in farmer subsidies authorized in the IRA to be spent on the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)\u2014a plan to encourage farmers to take up practices with potential environmental benefits, such as cover cropping and better waste storage. At least one contracted farming project funded by EQIP has been paused by the Trump administration, Reuters reports.\nThe $300 million was supposed to be used to establish an agricultural greenhouse gas network that could monitor the effectiveness of the kinds of conservation practices funded by EQIP and other multibillion-dollar conservation programs, says Emily Bass, associate director of federal policy, food, and agriculture at the environmental research center the Breakthrough Institute. This work was being carried out in part by the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), two of the scientific sub-agencies hit heavily by the federal layoffs.\nGot a Tip?\nAre you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what\u2019s happening? We\u2019d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at mattreynolds.45\n\u201cThat\u2019s a ton of taxpayer dollars, and the quantification work of ARS and NRCS is an essential part of measuring those programs\u2019 actual impacts on emissions reductions,\u201d says Bass. \u201cStopping or hamstringing efforts midway is a huge waste of resources that have already been spent.\u201d\nOne current ARS scientist, who spoke to WIRED anonymously, as they were not authorized to talk to the press, claims that at their unit almost 40 percent of scientists have been fired along with multiple support staff. Many of their unit\u2019s projects are now in disarray, the scientist says, including work that has been planned out in five-year cycles and requires close monitoring of plant specimens. \u201cIn the short term we can keep that material alive, but we can\u2019t necessarily do that indefinitely if we don\u2019t have anybody on that project.\u201d\nIn a press release, the USDA has said its plan is to \u201coptimize its workforce,\u201d with this including \u201crelocating employees out of the National Capital region into our nation\u2019s heartland to allow our rural communities to flourish.\u201d But ARS units are located across the US, each one specializing in crops that are important to local farmers as well as bringing jobs to the region. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been very popular in rural areas because the farmers and growers actually want what we\u2019re doing,\u201d says the ARS scientist. The USDA did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment.\nThe hollowing-out of staff capacity will limit the USDA\u2019s ability to implement IRA policies, says Bass, but it is not clear that this was the sole intention of the cuts. \u201cThis seems to be a sledgehammer to the workforce in a way that will just roll back the number of folks on payroll,\u201d she says.\nThe purge could also indirectly hit farmers in red states, who are the main beneficiaries of proposals such as EQIP. \u201cIt was necessary research to preserve our agricultural lands and fight climate change,\u201d says one ARS employee who was fired last week after serving more than two years of their three-year-long probation. \u201cCompared to the rest of the government, ARS is tiny,\u201d they say. \u201cBut we were able to get a lot done with relatively little money.\u201d\nOn her first full day in office, US secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins told USDA staffers gathered at its headquarters in Washington that she supported the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s attempt to optimize the USDA workforce. \u201cI welcome DOGE\u2019s efforts at USDA, because we know that its work makes us better, stronger, faster, and more efficient,\u201d she told the gathering.\nBut Bass warns that blanket firing of USDA employees is hardly a pathway toward a more efficient agency. \u201cThis approach of wide-swath firings throws the USDA and affiliated agricultural research enterprise into a world of uncertainty,\u201d she says. \u201cProjects that cannot be seen out to the end, cannot result in a peer-reviewed research paper or technical expertise being provided, are a waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d"

There were around 1,700 employees in total at the CFPB.\nThe mass reduction in force, or RIF, comes nearly a month after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from removing probationary employees at the CFPB and other agencies. On Friday, an appeals court ruled that the CFPB could begin terminations again so long as \u201cindividual assessments\u201d were conducted for each terminated employee. Around 200 employees will be left at the CFPB, effectively gutting the agency Elon Musk has previously said should be \u2018deleted.\u2019\nIn an email sent to CFPB staff on Wednesday, CFPB chief legal officer Mark Paoletta announced that the agency would be shifting its focus away from its supervisory roles and towards \u201ctangible harm to consumers.\u201d Medical debt, student loans, consumer data, and digital payments have all been identified as topics the CFPB will \u201cdeprioritize,\u201d according to the document.\n\u201cAs far as I can tell it affects literally every office to at least some extent with at least some of them fully wiped out,\u201d says one terminated CFPB worker. \u201cMy guess is by the end there will be just a few leadership positions remaining plus skeleton crew for very obviously legally required functions of the bureau.\nThe CFPB was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, an expansive piece of legislation that imposed consequential regulatory reform in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The agency was created to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive financial practices, and it claims to be responsible for $19.7 billion in consumer relief since its inception, as well as $5 billion in civil penalties\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t follow the CBA [collective bargaining agreement], aren\u2019t following Dodd-Frank, and did not provide sufficient notice to anyone,\u201d claims a CFPB employee who lost their job on Thursday.\n| Got a Tip? |\n|---|\n| Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening?

In February, Musk wrote \u201cRIP CFPB\u201d with a gravestone emoji in an X post. In November, he posted, \u201cDelete CFPB.\u201d\nIn February, WIRED reported that three DOGE operatives, including Gavin Kliger and Nikhil Rajpal, were given access to the CFPB\u2019s HR, procurement, and financial infrastructure. The DOGE workers were later granted access to all of the agency\u2019s systems on Friday, Bloomberg reported, including bank examination and enforcement records. Further requests for DOGE access continued throughout the month.\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to what they say about the CFPB, pay attention to what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Emily Peterson-Cassin, the corporate power director at the Demand Progress Education Fund, said in a statement responding to the cuts on Thursday. \u201cAnd what they\u2019re doing is systematically gutting all efforts to protect service members, and all Americans, from fraud and scams while simultaneously letting Wall Street, Big Banks and Big Tech off the hook.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Zo\u00eb Schiffer."

      "text": "On January 20, DeepSeek, a relatively unknown AI research lab from China, released an open source model that\u2019s quickly become the talk of the town in Silicon Valley. According to a paper authored by the company, DeepSeek-R1 beats the industry\u2019s leading models like OpenAI o1 on several math and reasoning benchmarks. In fact, on many metrics that matter\u2014capability, cost, openness\u2014DeepSeek is giving Western AI giants a run for their money.\nDeepSeek\u2019s success points to an unintended outcome of the tech cold war between the US and China. US export controls have severely curtailed the ability of Chinese tech firms to compete on AI in the Western way\u2014that is, infinitely scaling up by buying more chips and training for a longer period of time. As a result, most Chinese companies have focused on downstream applications rather than building their own models. But with its latest release, DeepSeek proves that there\u2019s another way to win: by revamping the foundational structure of AI models and using limited resources more efficiently.\n\u201cUnlike many Chinese AI firms that rely heavily on access to advanced hardware, DeepSeek has focused on maximizing software-driven resource optimization,\u201d explains Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, who studies Chinese innovations. \u201cDeepSeek has embraced open source methods, pooling collective expertise and fostering collaborative innovation. This approach not only mitigates resource constraints but also accelerates the development of cutting-edge technologies, setting DeepSeek apart from more insular competitors.\u201d\nSo who is behind the AI startup? And why are they suddenly releasing an industry-leading model and giving it away for free? WIRED talked to experts on China\u2019s AI industry and read detailed interviews with DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng to piece together the story behind the firm\u2019s meteoric rise. DeepSeek did not respond to several inquiries sent by WIRED.\nA Star Hedge Fund in China\nEven within the Chinese AI industry, DeepSeek is an unconventional player. It started as Fire-Flyer, a deep-learning research branch of High-Flyer, one of China\u2019s best-performing quantitative hedge funds. Founded in 2015, the hedge fund quickly rose to prominence in China, becoming the first quant hedge fund to raise over 100 billion RMB (around $15 billion). (Since 2021, the number has dipped to around $8 billion, though High-Flyer remains one of the most important quant hedge funds in the country.)\nFor years, High-Flyer had been stockpiling GPUs and building Fire-Flyer supercomputers to analyze financial data. Then, in 2023, Liang, who has a master's degree in computer science, decided to pour the fund\u2019s resources into a new company called DeepSeek that would build its own cutting-edge models\u2014and hopefully develop artificial general intelligence. It was as if Jane Street had decided to become an AI startup and burn its cash on scientific research.\nBold vision. But somehow, it worked. \u201cDeepSeek represents a new generation of Chinese tech companies that prioritize long-term technological advancement over quick commercialization,\u201d says Zhang.\nLiang told the Chinese tech publication 36Kr that the decision was driven by scientific curiosity rather than a desire to turn a profit. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to find a commercial reason [for founding DeepSeek] even if you ask me to,\u201d he explained. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not worth it commercially. Basic science research has a very low return-on-investment ratio. When OpenAI\u2019s early investors gave it money, they sure weren\u2019t thinking about how much return they would get. Rather, it was that they really wanted to do this thing.\u201d\nToday, DeepSeek is one of the only leading AI firms in China that doesn\u2019t rely on funding from tech giants like Baidu, Alibaba, or ByteDance.\nA Young Group of Geniuses Eager to Prove Themselves\nAccording to Liang, when he put together DeepSeek\u2019s research team, he was not looking for experienced engineers to build a consumer-facing product. Instead, he focused on PhD students from China\u2019s top universities, including Peking University and Tsinghua University, who were eager to prove themselves. Many had been published in top journals and won awards at international academic conferences, but lacked industry experience, according to the Chinese tech publication QBitAI.\n\u201cOur core technical positions are mostly filled by people who graduated this year or in the past one or two years,\u201d Liang told 36Kr in 2023. The hiring strategy helped create a collaborative company culture where people were free to use ample computing resources to pursue unorthodox research projects. It\u2019s a starkly different way of operating from established internet companies in China, where teams are often competing for resources. (A recent example: ByteDance accused a former intern\u2014a prestigious academic award winner, no less\u2014of sabotaging his colleagues\u2019 work in order to hoard more computing resources for his team.)\nLiang said that students can be a better fit for high-investment, low-profit research. \u201cMost people, when they are young, can devote themselves completely to a mission without utilitarian considerations,\u201d he explained. His pitch to prospective hires is that DeepSeek was created to \u201csolve the hardest questions in the world.\u201d\nThe fact that these young researchers are almost entirely educated in China adds to their drive, experts say. \u201cThis younger generation also embodies a sense of patriotism, particularly as they navigate US restrictions and choke points in critical hardware and software technologies,\u201d explains Zhang. \u201cTheir determination to overcome these barriers reflects not only personal ambition but also a broader commitment to advancing China\u2019s position as a global innovation leader.\u201d\nInnovation Born out of a Crisis\nIn October 2022, the US government started putting together export controls that severely restricted Chinese AI companies from accessing cutting-edge chips like Nvidia\u2019s H100. The move presented a problem for DeepSeek. The firm had started out with a stockpile of 10,000 A100\u2019s, but it needed more to compete with firms like OpenAI and Meta. \u201cThe problem we are facing has never been funding, but the export control on advanced chips,\u201d Liang told 36Kr in a second interview in 2024.\nDeepSeek had to come up with more efficient methods to train its models. \u201cThey optimized their model architecture using a battery of engineering tricks\u2014custom communication schemes between chips, reducing the size of fields to save memory, and innovative use of the mix-of-models approach,\u201d says Wendy Chang, a software engineer turned policy analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. \u201cMany of these approaches aren\u2019t new ideas, but combining them successfully to produce a cutting-edge model is a remarkable feat.\u201d\nDeepSeek has also made significant progress on Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts, two technical designs that make DeepSeek models more cost-effective by requiring fewer computing resources to train. In fact, DeepSeek's latest model is so efficient that it required one-tenth the computing power of Meta's comparable Llama 3.1 model to train, according to the research institution Epoch AI.\nDeepSeek\u2019s willingness to share these innovations with the public has earned it considerable goodwill within the global AI research community. For many Chinese AI companies, developing open source models is the only way to play catch-up with their Western counterparts, because it attracts more users and contributors, which in turn help the models grow. \u201cThey\u2019ve now demonstrated that cutting-edge models can be built using less, though still a lot of, money and that the current norms of model-building leave plenty of room for optimization,\u201d Chang says. \u201cWe are sure to see a lot more attempts in this direction going forward.\u201d\nThe news could spell trouble for the current US export controls that focus on creating computing resource bottlenecks. \u201cExisting estimates of how much AI computing power China has, and what they can achieve with it, could be upended,\u201d Chang says.\nCorrection 1/27/24 2:08pm ET: An earlier version of this story said DeepSeek has reportedly has a stockpile of 10,000 H100 Nvidia chips. It has been updated to clarify the stockpile is believed to be A100 chips."

Around 50 of the 70 members of the US Digital Corps, an early-career, two-year government fellowship, were terminated as well, sources say. Sources also tell WIRED that TTS management met with workers individually prior to the terminations, giving them one last chance to take the deferred resignation offered in the \u201cFork in the Road\u201d email from late last month.\nOne TTS staffer called the meetings \u201ccoercive for sure.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people are being let go, but multiple sources tell WIRED that list could be upwards of 70 if not more.

      "text": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\nThe Federal Government has a constitutional duty and a moral responsibility to respect and promote the free speech rights of Americans. Yet in recent years, elitist leaders in Government have unlawfully censored speech and weaponized their undeserved influence to silence perceived political opponents and advance their preferred, and often erroneous, narrative about significant matters of public debate. These disgraceful actions have taken the form of coercive threats against the private sector \u2014 including major social media platforms \u2014 to suppress conservative or dissenting voices and distort public opinion. Much of this censorship took place during a Presidential election with the apparent purpose of undermining the free exchange of ideas and debate.\nChristopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority. Krebs\u2019 misconduct involved the censorship of disfavored speech implicating the 2020 election and COVID-19 pandemic. CISA, under Krebs\u2019 leadership, suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting supposed disinformation, and recruited and coerced major social media platforms to further its partisan mission. CISA covertly worked to blind the American public to the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. Krebs, through CISA, promoted the censorship of election information, including known risks associated with certain voting practices. Similarly, Krebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines. Krebs skewed the bona fide debate about COVID-19 by attempting to discredit widely shared views that ran contrary to CISA\u2019s favored perspective.\nAbusive conduct of this sort both violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself. Those who engage in or support such conduct must not have continued access to our Nation\u2019s secrets. Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive department and agencies (agencies) to immediately take steps consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearance held by Christopher Krebs.\nI further direct the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant agencies to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\nI further direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with any other agency head, to take all appropriate action to review Krebs\u2019 activities as a Government employee, including his leadership of CISA. This review should identify any instances where Krebs\u2019 conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for Federal employees, involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information, or contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149 of January 20, 2025 (Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship). As part of that review, I direct a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA\u2019s activities over the last 6 years, focusing specifically on any instances where CISA\u2019s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149. Upon completing these reviews, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a joint report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of Executive Order 14149.\nThis memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person."
