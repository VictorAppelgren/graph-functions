  "title": "BioShock 4 hits a major development snag, and a remake of the original gets put on ice",
  "description": "According to Bloomberg, the fourth game in the BioShock series has to revamp its storyline, while a remake of the original was put on hold earlier this year.",
  "content": "BioShock fans will have to wait even longer to find out if we're going to Rapture, Columbia or a brand new city since the next game in the franchise may be headed back to the drawing board. According to a report from Bloomberg, the latest BioShock game that's being developed by Cloud Chamber failed a review with executives at 2K Games. Bloomberg's sources explained that the execs wanted improvement with the game's narrative, which \"will be revamped in the coming months.\"\n\n2K Games said in a statement to Bloomberg that it currently has a \"good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one.\" As the fourth installment in the hit BioShock franchise, it has to follow up on the success of BioShock Infinite, which was released in 2013 and earned several awards for overall design, gameplay, story and original soundtrack. The latest development hitch also comes along with some major changes in the game studio's leadership. According to Bloomberg, Cloud Chamber's studio head, Kelley Gilmore, left the role, while the studio's creative director, Hogarth de la Plante, was shifted to a publishing position.\n\nWhile the title isn't confirmed, the game believed to be BioShock 4 was announced in 2019 along with the creation of the Cloud Chamber studio. We still don't have a game six years later and the studio responsible may be at risk of layoffs, as the latest Bloomberg report mentioned a recent all-hands meeting where Cloud Chamber developers were told the company \"needs to become more agile and efficient.\"\n\nThe fourth BioShock isn't the only game in the series that seems to be stuck in development hell. According to Bloomberg, the remake of the original BioShock was reportedly shelved earlier this year by 2K Games. The breakout hit that threw players into the unique setting of Rapture came out in 2007 and has since been remastered in 2016 as part of BioShock: The Collection. The remaster was made to support 1080p resolution and higher frame rates, but fans have been waiting for a complete remake that portrays the dystopian underwater city with more modern graphics.",

      "text": "'BioShock: The Collection' hits PS4, Xbox One and PC in September\nDive back into all three remastered games and their DLC packs in a $60 bundle.\nBreak out the wetsuits -- you're going back to Rapture. BioShock: The Collection contains all three BioShock games and their single-player DLC packs, remastered for current-generation consoles. It's due to hit PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on September 13th across North America and Asia (that's September 15th in Australia and September 16th worldwide), and the whole bundle costs $60.\nSpecifically, BioShock: The Collection includes remastered versions of BioShock, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite, plus all of their single-player DLC packs. There are a few caveats here: BioShock 2 in particular won't feature multiplayer content in the new bundle. Also, BioShock Infinite has not been remastered for PC because \"it already meets current-gen console standards and runs smoothly on high visual settings,\" 2K Games says. Note that Infinite landed on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC in March 2013.\nA few extra goodies are thrown into The Collection, including a director's commentary reel called Imagining BioShock starring series creator Ken Levine, and a behind-the-scenes tour of the original BioShock's development called Museum of Orphaned Concepts. BioShock's Challenge Rooms also make an appearance in the bundle. The Collection includes BioShock 2's Minerva's Den and Protector Trials DLC packs, plus BioShock Infinite's Burial at Sea, Clash in the Clouds and Columbia's Finest add-on packs.\nFans have long been clamoring for current-generation versions of the BioShock trilogy, and just yesterday 2K Games revealed the series' official twitter account. News of the remastered collection leaked a little early thanks to a series of images uploaded to the official 2K Games website this week. But of course, when you're dealing with an elaborate underwater city, leaks are expected."

      "text": "A new BioShock game is in development\nA new studio will be led by Kelley Gilmore, a veteran of XCOM and Civilization.\n2K Games has announced the formation of a new studio, Cloud Chamber, which will take the lead on a new title in the Bioshock series. Cloud Chamber has offices in California and Montreal, and will be headed up by 2K veteran Kelley Gilmore, who has previously worked on Civilization and XCOM.\nAs well as Gilmore, Bioshock veterans Hoagy de le Plante, Scott Sinclair and Jonathan Pelling are also involved. One name that isn't mentioned is original creator Ken Levine, who has moved on to work on a new title at Ghost Story Games, and isn't likely to have any influence here.\nIn an interview with GamesRadar, Gilmore says that Bioshock's unique environments -- from the underwater city of Rapture to the floating city of Columbia and, uh, back to Rapture -- are \"incredibly important to the gameplay experience.\" She added that there are plenty of \"creative directions to explore,\" which might hint that the team will find a new setting for this fourth title in the saga.\nThe announcement tallies with rumors that have swirled around the industry since last year, claiming that work on this game began at the tail-end of Mafia III's development. According to a lengthy Kotaku report, Mafia studio Hangar 13 was raided for talent by an unnamed studio for a secret Bioshock game.\n2K's announcement says that the title will be in development for \"the next several years,\" and so expect this to drop long after the next-generation of consoles have launched."
