  "description": "Former Superman star Dean Cain responded to HBO host John Oliver\u2019s rant against the actor recently announcing that he would be sworn in as an ICE agent.",
  "content": "Former \"Superman\" actor Dean Cain ridiculed \"Last Week Tonight\" host John Oliver on Monday over his monologue claiming Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was \"f---ed\" if they let the actor join its ranks.\n\nNear the end of his show on Sunday, Oliver mocked both ICE and Cain over news that ICE had removed its age limits and would be swearing in the \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\" star as an \"honorary ICE officer.\"\n\n\"You know, there's an old saying in Hollywood: \u2018If all you can get is Dean Cain, you are f---ed,\u2019\" Oliver said on his show.\n\n\"Now, I'm not saying that ICE isn't finding people. I'm just saying, when you are reduced to pinning a badge on the 59-year-old star of 'The Dog Who Saved Christmas,' 'The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation,' 'The Dog Who Saved the Holidays,' 'The Dog Who Saved Halloween,' 'The Dog Who Saved Easter,' and 'The Dog Who Saved Summer,' maybe you are in trouble.\"\n\nJOHN LEGUIZAMO TORCHES DEAN CAIN AS A 'LOSER' FOR JOINING ICE, BUT SUPERMAN ACTOR OFFERS GENTLE REPLY\n\nHe added, \"Although, on the plus side, no need for that guy to wear a mask because the chances of anyone recognizing him are f---ing zero.\"\n\nCain mocked the HBO host in kind on X the next morning.\n\n\"He stole that mask joke from the internet -- and he also laughed hysterically when Trump said he was going to run for President. Case closed. (and those movies were sweet, by the way!),\" Cain wrote.\n\nDuring the show, Oliver also gave advice to viewers on how to interact with ICE agents, telling them to only say \"Am I free to leave?\" and \"I want to speak to a lawyer.\"\n\n\"And I recognize that in some cases you may be unable to help yourself from saying, 'Didn\u2019t you used to be Superman? I thought you died. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting a filmmaker,\u2019 but that really is it,\" Oliver joked.\n\nFORMER SUPERMAN ACTOR DEAN CAIN SWORN IN AS RESERVE POLICE OFFICER\n\nCain will be sworn in as an honorary officer in the coming month, assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s spokesperson, said. Although it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what his duties as an honorary officer would entail.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Cain described joining ICE as a way to show support for the officers that he believes were being \"vilified\" for doing their jobs.\n\n\"If you're a legal citizen here in this country, no worries, you're great, but if you're here illegally, you've broken the law to begin with, whatever the circumstances are. You had multiple opportunities to self-deport, and the fact that these men and women who are doing their jobs are getting vilified, I had to stand up with them and for them, because I think it takes people standing up to change the culture,\" Cain said.\n\nCain also defended joining ICE during a heated debate with anti-Trump The Bulwark host Tim Miller on \"Piers Morgan Uncensored\" on Monday.\n\n\"Now we've got ICE agents \u2014 and, apparently, former \u2018Superman\u2019 actors \u2014 who are going to jump out of vans and nab them and hold them in deportation cells. That's insane. Like, that's not how you act in a free country,\" Miller mocked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'm not untrained,\" Cain shot back, bringing up how he became a deputy sheriff and a reserve police officer nearly a decade ago.\n\n\"So, I don't know why you're saying untrained. And by the way, when you join ICE, they train you. So, to say that and try to denigrate because I'm an actor, I shouldn't be able to be concerned about what's going on with our borders or with our law enforcement agencies is denigrating. It's ridiculous. Should I say because you're a former Republican strategist, you have no say on anything? That's baloney,\" he added.\n\nFox News' Janelle Ash and Larry Fink contributed to this report.",

Noem says they are looking to make 10,000 hires, and she said ICE has already received 80,000 applications.\n\"We are ENDING the age cap for ICE law enforcement. Qualified candidates can now apply with no age limit,\" Noem wrote on X.\n\"Calling all patriots. Submit your application TODAY,\" added White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\nTRUMP SUGGESTS BORDER CRACKDOWN IS 'SAVING A LOT OF MONEY' AFTER STARK DROP FROM BIDEN ERA CROSSINGS\nICE is seeking to entice more applicants with a signing bonus of up to $50,0000, options to repay or forgive student loans and other benefits.\n\"Your country is calling on you to serve at ICE and defend the Homeland,\" Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in a statement. \"In the wake of the Biden administration\u2019s open border policies, the dedicated men and women of ICE now face unprecedented challenges in removing millions of criminal illegal aliens from our country. Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, we now have funding to recruit and hire Americans who want to patriotically serve their country and protect American communities.\"\nThe recruitment effort comes as the agency continues to amp up operations to counter illegal immigration, including deporting those with criminal convictions and charges on top of entering the country illegally.\nAccording to DHS, there\u2019s been an 830% increase in assaults on agents amid riots and protests throughout the country, including last month in the Los Angeles area.\nOn the recruitment web page, the agency has \"How dangerous is the work?\" listed as a frequently asked question.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"ICE law enforcement officers should expect a certain level of risk when performing their duties; however, they are expertly trained and every precaution is taken by ICE when it comes to protecting its officers' well-being,\" the website states.\nFox News' Cameron Arcand contributed to this report"

And they're black, and they are brown and green and yellow and Japanese and whatever. They're a cross-section of Americans,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"They are doing their job, the job that Congress wrote the laws for them to support and uphold, and they're doing the job of deporting people who are here illegally.\n\"If you're a legal citizen here in this country, no worries, you're great, but if you're here illegally, you've broken the law to begin with, whatever the circumstances are.

It's controversial because people look at it emotionally as opposed to what the law is and what we're trying to do here. And then they don't look at it critically and think, you know, \u2018What does allowing 20 million people into this country illegally do to voting, to our services, our health support services, our social services?\u2019 It destroys it,\" he said.\n\"Social Security, Medicaid, it just destroys everything that we have worked for and built in this country for American citizens.

It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what his duties as an honorary officer would entail.\nCain told Fox News Digital he's just happy to be showing his support to the \"brave\" men and women tackling immigration issues in America.\nThe actor has his own opinions on how he wants to see the immigration system in America evolve.\n\"So, first of all, we can expand the number of people who come in. We have a million people who are allowed in every year. We could expand that number and change the criteria,\" he said.\nCain pointed out that America's current immigration system is full of \"weird programs,\" including a lottery, and praised President Donald Trump's $5 million gold card that streamlines American citizenship as a good option for the country.\nWATCH: DEAN CAIN SHARES WHAT HE WANTS TO SEE CHANGE IN IMMIGRATION POLICY\n\"I think merit is a huge part of it. What do you bring to the United States? How do you make this country better? What are you going to bring? What are you going to do?

So, I would like to see that open up, that meritocracy open up, and I would like to see a more streamlined process where it doesn't take someone seven years to come over legally,\" Cain said.\nCain noted that a major point in Trump's presidential campaign was immigration. He ran on deporting illegal immigrants, and Cain is pleased with how his administration has been handling the issue, but he would like to see legislation passed.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\"I'm very happy with what's going on in this administration.
