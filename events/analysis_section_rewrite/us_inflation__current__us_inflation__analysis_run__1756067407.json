      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world‑class quality the piece must tighten the 0–3 week logic into a precise, testable chain, quantify every claim with the exact figures available, and map each driver to a concrete near‑term catalyst and invalidation point. Actionable edits: (1) sharpen horizon by enumerating immediate drivers and catalysts with dates or quick‑turn triggers drawn from the sources (tariff pass‑through on autos per S15934PBQ and Nikkei/Asia data; auto‑financing cost i.e., 6.43% average new‑car loan rate per CDBMWIUTB; observed Vegas discretionary price pressure per 6OOEK8TUR) and set explicit near‑term catalysts (announcement of further tariff adjustments; auto maker price actions; 8‑30g litigation outcomes; Bethel planning decisions). (2) tighten the causal chain: show how tariff pass‑through increases auto prices, elevates monthly payments via existing financing costs, and dampens auto/retail demand, then connect that to softening consumer discretionary signals (Vegas cost concerns) and finally to potential, credible policy anchoring from central banks (Lagarde on independence from U6HXAJR4J) that prevents runaway yields; replace broad statements with quantified links (e.g., “tariff costs are being passed through to prices,” with the cited price/margin dynamics from S15934PBQ). (3) add explicit invalidation tests: if within 1–2 weeks tariff announcements fail to show any price uptick in autos or if auto‑loan rates stabilize below the highlighted range, then thesis weakens; if 8‑30g outcomes push new supply into Bethel’s pipeline, supply relief could mute near‑term price pressures. (4) beef up numerical grounding: consistently anchor every claim to a figure from the IDs (CDBMWIUTB’s 6.43% rate; F8GF45MEU’s Bethel price/income metrics; 75 units/4–5 stories in Bethel; 15% tariff vs prior levels in S15934PBQ; Vegas price anecdotes only as micro‑signal, not macro driver). (5) strengthen scenario framing: present base/base‑case/bear cases with 0–3 week viability, stating the exact triggers required for each, rather than a single blended narrative. (6) ensure fmt/length discipline: keep to a compact paragraph but clearly separate drivers, catalysts, and monitoring signals; (7) audit sources for conflicts and reconcile them (e.g., tariffs discussed as seasonality vs transmission in S15934PBQ) and ensure every assertion has an ID. In short, replace broad narrative with a tightly scoped, data‑driven, trigger‑based map: near‑term tariff news and auto pricing (S15934PBQ) → financing tightness (CDBMWIUTB) → discretionary demand signals (6OOEK8TUR) → credibility/monetary‑policy anchors (U6HXAJR4J) → local housing supply risk (F8GF45MEU), and define explicit thresholds and next‑step monitor points.",
