  "title": "Meta Picks Pimco, Blue Owl for $29B Data Center Deal",
  "description": "Meta Platforms Inc. has selected Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. to lead a $29 billion financing for its data center expansion in rural Louisiana as the race for artificial intelligence infrastructure heats up, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Pimco is expected to lead a $26 billion debt portion of the financing, while Blue Owl is providing $3 billion of equity, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center\u2019s assets, they said. Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of internet research at Evercore ISI says Meta is reaccelerating their revenue growth using AI.  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "I think the facts are this is the most activist administration. When it comes to business. Maybe since FDR. I don't know. I'm a history of be of. I'm a student of U.S. history. But you're stretching me there. But yeah, this is this is an extraordinarily activist administration. And anyway, so I guess that's one and maybe the most obvious factor is tariffs, which are at the end of the day attacks. And so somebody's going to pay that tax and it's either American businesses or it's American consumers. So, yes, that's out there. And then, yeah, there's a lot of pressure or attempts to influence these these companies. So that's out there to look. All of that's part of the backdrop that all of these CEOs and these executives have to deal with. They're paid to deal with this these kind of challenges. It's just unusually high, you know, in this administration, the backdrop to the tech sector. However, there's some other things that are well within their control that that are really lifting, you know, what's a three year bull market now in tech stocks? And that's it's Jenee I. And what we're seeing in terms of reduced costs and improved processes and improved products and solutions and offerings, it's really, you know, we're going through a, a major supercycle here when it comes to Jenny, I know it's been overhyped at times, but there's a lot of reality behind it. And there's some companies that have had really good stock price performance precisely because they're perceived as Gen-Y winners. That's right. And of course, when you're talking about a I have to bring up semiconductor and chip maker stocks. When you think about the juxtaposition between former President Biden's types of policies versus President Trump's call just recently for 100% tariffs on ships coming into the US, will all this make for more robust, domestically located semiconductor industry, or is that really possible? Break that down for us. I'm not sure. I've got a really thoughtful, educated answer to that question you're asking. It's there's a you're asking whether if you want to promote U.S. manufacturing, particularly in what are considered to be highly strategic industries, whether it's better to use incentives and subsidies. I think that crudely explains the Biden administration policy or whether it's better to use, you know, tariffs and browbeat companies to come back into the U.S. And I'm not sure I mean, they're both active government policies into into businesses. And so I'm not sure it is an it just an interesting step up. I mean, we had a laissez faire, you know, economy generally government stays out of the way of of business. And, you know, a lot of what I look, I'm out here in Techland land, most of these companies are out here and they've been very successful run by entrepreneurs. They come from different parts of the world. They come to California area in other parts of the U.S. and we create these extraordinary businesses and they've done it on their own. I mean, always there's always some help there, but they're pretty much done it on their own. And I think that's actually created a really good situation for people in this country. I hope we don't I hope we don't spoil that. Well, let's get to some of the numbers that we got this week and certainly the week before I caught some of your calls following the updates. Zillow was out this week. You raise your price target on it. Uber, too. You raised your price target on that 1 to 150 DoorDash. Are you up 2 to 360? The price target, what companies results show to you? Kind of a more interesting investment thesis as a result. As a result, either this week or last week when we got some of the big major tech names? Well, I like to set up a question. So where I thought we had some just really surprisingly constructive, positive results, I thought DoorDash was in that list. We had some record high operating margins out of that company. Meta was definitely in that list, and most of the other names, I thought those are kind of two standout companies. Maybe Booking.com was in that list too. The other names, you know, we had some good prints out of names like Google. We had some good prints out of names like, you know, Amazon. But but, but the really strongest kind of cleanest prints there were there were a few in there. And I would put I put booking in there, DoorDash and yeah, yeah, those would probably be at the top of the list And, and if you just step back because you're asking about something, we started off talking about some of these macro concerns and these companies give you a very broad read into the economy. They do into consumer demand, into some enterprise demand. And if I use one single word to describe the results of this earnings season, it's resilience. It's not like we had a positive inflection, although there are a few cases where that happened. But generally the overall view is that spend has been relatively resilient and it's at a relatively robust, you know, level for these companies. It's, you know, this this may change in the back half of the year, but so far, so far, so good. Mark, you're comfortable with Metta in particular? I mean, we had some news today, too, that they have selected PIMCO, blew our cap, our capital, to lead a $29 billion financing for their data center expansion in rural Louisiana. It's all about the race for AI infrastructure. We know that this is according to people familiar that major mega spend and the talent grab and what they're spending for air talent matter. You're comfortable with all of it. Well, I guess if they keep putting up prints, if they keep putting up fundamental results like they are doing, where they're using A.I. to improve their their cost structure, but also to improve their products, like you're getting an ah, oh, I, you know, return on our ROI, return on investment are oh, I return on all that. I have to expand and OP expand their they took their revenue growth and they re accelerated it despite being at the scale that they're at you know 150 billion roughly revenue run rate. They took their, they took their revenue growth and accelerated to 20%. They didn't come out of nowhere. They were using AI to to better target ad campaigns. And so marketers are getting a better return on their on their meta ad spend and and consumers are finding the service better. I mean, the evidence is that they're spending more time with Metta. They're spending more time with Instagram. There's nothing more objective than just time spent. So they've been able to has been able to use all that air investment to improve their product, improve their service. And yeah, so if you keep doing that, you absolutely you earn the right to spend more, to invest more.",

  "summary": "The author discusses the most activist administration in business since FDR, with tariffs, pressure from the US government and attempts to influence companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. He points out that this is an unusually high level of activism in the tech sector, particularly in the semiconductor and chip maker industries. The author suggests that while these companies are often overhyped, reality behind them, companies that have had good stock price performance due to their perceived as Gen-Y winners are outperforming. He also notes that the recent rise in interest in semiconductor industry is encouraging, with questions about whether it's better to use tariffs to promote U.S. manufacturing in highly strategic industries than using incentives and subsidies. Jenee I. concludes that the current administration's focus is on reducing costs and improving processes and improving product and solutions and offerings. She suggests that this three-year bull market in tech stocks is creating a more interesting investment thesis.",
