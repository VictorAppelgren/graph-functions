  "description": "Adobe has significantly underperformed the broader market over the past year, yet analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the stock\u2019s prospects.",
  "content": "San Jose, California-based Adobe Inc. (ADBE) is a diversified software company operating through Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising segments. With a market cap of $144.7 billion, Adobe operates as one of the largest software companies in the world.\n\nThe software giant has significantly underperformed the broader market over the past year. Adobe\u2019s stock has plummeted 37.8% over the past 52 weeks and approximately 25% on a YTD basis, compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 19.3% gains over the past year and 8.4% returns in 2025.\n\u2022 Tesla Is Axing Its Dojo Supercomputer Plans. What Does That Mean for TSLA Stock Here?\n\u2022 Should You Buy the Post-Preliminary Earnings Plunge in C3.ai Stock?\n\u2022 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief \u2013 your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nNarrowing the focus, Adobe has also lagged behind the industry-focused iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF\u2019s (IGV) 31.4% surge over the past year and 8.2% uptick in 2025.\n\nAdobe\u2019s stock prices dropped 5.3% in the trading session after the release of its mixed Q2 results on Jun. 12. Driven by solid ARR and momentum, the company\u2019s overall topline for the quarter grew 10.6% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, setting a record for Q2 and surpassing Street projections. Meanwhile, its non-GAAP net income increased 7.3% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, and benefiting from share repurchases, its non-GAAP EPS surged by 12.9% to $5.06, beating the consensus estimates.\n\nDespite these impressive figures, investors have been concerned about Adobe\u2019s future growth potential as its remaining performance obligation (RPO), a key indicator of its growth, has remained under pressure. In Q1, its RPO came in at $19.7 billion, which fell short of expectations. Further, its RPO remained steady at $19.7 billion at the end of Q2, making investors jittery. Moreover, investors have also been concerned about the intense competition that Adobe\u2019s products are facing from Gen AI tools.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2025, ending in November, analysts expect Adobe to report a non-GAAP EPS of $16.92, up 13.6% year-over-year. The company has a solid earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.\n\nAmong the 34 analysts covering the ADBE stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 23 \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d eight \u201cHold,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating.",
