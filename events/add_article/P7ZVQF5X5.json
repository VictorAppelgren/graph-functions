      "summary": "India’s new consumption tax cuts are expected to boost GDP and demand, especially for discretionary goods, due to high price elasticity in the country. The CIO notes that the fiscal benefit outweighed the tax cut in 2019, improving the fiscal position. However, the impact is tempered by ongoing U.S. tariffs and uncertainty over their duration, which could dampen short‑term growth. Overall, the reforms are seen as a positive catalyst for India’s long‑term secular drivers, while short‑term risks remain linked to trade policy and inflation.",
