  "content": "This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.\n\n Why Trump\u2019s \u201cgolden dome\u201d missile defense idea is another ripped straight from the movies\n\nWithin a week of his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order to develop \u201cThe Iron Dome for America\u201d (rebranded the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d a month later.) The eruption of a revived conflict between Israel and Iran in June has only strengthened the case for an American version of the Iron Dome in the eyes of the administration. Trump has often expressed admiration for Israel\u2019s Iron Dome, an air defense system that can intercept short-range rockets and artillery over the small nation and that is funded in part by the United States. But in the complicated security landscape confronting the world today, is spectacle the same as safety? Read the full story. This story is from our forthcoming print issue, which is all about security. If you haven\u2019t already, subscribe now to receive future issues once they land. MIT Technology Review Narrated: Can nuclear power really fuel the rise of AI?\n\n\n\nIn the AI arms race, all the major players say they want to go nuclear. Over the past year, the likes of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have sent out a flurry of announcements related to nuclear energy. Some are about agreements to purchase power from existing plants, while others are about investments looking to boost unproven advanced technologies.\n\nThese somewhat unlikely partnerships could be a win for both the nuclear power industry and large tech companies. But there\u2019s one glaring potential roadblock: timing. This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we\u2019re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Just navigate to MIT Technology Review Narrated on either platform, and follow us to get all our new content as it\u2019s released.

      "text": "Health practitioners, companies, and others have for years hailed the potential benefits of AI in medicine, from improving medical imaging to outperforming doctors at diagnostic assessments. The transformative technology has even been predicted by AI enthusiasts to one day help find a \u201ccure to cancer.\u201d\nBut a new study has found that doctors who regularly used AI actually became less skilled within months.\nThe study, which was published on Wednesday in the Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology journal, found that over the course of six months, clinicians became over-reliant on AI recommendations and became themselves \u201cless motivated, less focused, and less responsible when making cognitive decisions without AI assistance.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the latest study to demonstrate potential adverse outcomes on AI users. An earlier study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that ChatGPT eroded critical thinking skills.\nHow the study was conducted\nResearchers across various European institutions conducted an observational study surveying four endoscopy centers in Poland that participated in the Artificial Intelligence in Colonoscopy for Cancer Prevention (ACCEPT) trial. The study was funded by the European Commission and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.\nAs part of the trial, the centers had introduced AI tools for the detection of polyps\u2014growths that can be benign or cancerous\u2014in late 2021. The study looked at 1,443 non-AI-assisted colonoscopies out of a total 2,177 colonoscopies conducted between September 2021 and March 2022. The colonoscopies were performed by 19 experienced endoscopists.\nResearchers compared the quality of colonoscopy conducted three months before and three months after AI was implemented. Colonoscopies were conducted either with or without AI assistance, at random. Of those conducted without AI assistance, 795 were conducted before regular AI use was implemented and 648 were conducted after the AI tools were introduced.\nWhat the study found\nThree months before AI was introduced, the adenoma detection rate (ADR) was around 28%. Three months after AI was introduced, the rate dropped to 22% when clinicians were unassisted by AI. ADR is a commonly used quality indicator for colonoscopies and represents \u201cthe proportion of screening colonoscopies performed by a physician that detect at least one histologically confirmed colorectal adenoma or adenocarcinoma.\u201d Adenomas are precancerous growths, and a higher ADR is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.\nThe study found that AI did help endoscopists with detection when used, but once the assistance was removed, clinicians were worse at detection.\nResearchers attributed it to \u201cthe natural human tendency to over-rely\u201d on the recommendations of decision support systems like AI.\n\u201cImagine that you want to travel anywhere, and you're unable to use Google Maps,\u201d Marcin Roma\u0144czyk, co-author of the study and an assistant professor at the Medical University of Silesia, told MedPage Today. \u201cWe call it the Google Maps effect. We try to get somewhere, and it\u2019s impossible to use a regular map. It works very similarly.\u201d\nImplications of the study\nOmer Ahmad, a consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital London who wrote an editorial alongside the study but was not involved in its research, tells TIME that it\u2019s likely that exposure to AI weakened doctors\u2019 visual search habits and alerting gaze patterns, which are critical for detecting polyps.\n\u201cIn essence, dependence on AI detection could dull human pattern recognition,\u201d Ahmad says. He adds that regular use of AI could also \u201creduce diagnostic confidence\u201d when AI assistance is withdrawn, or that the endoscopists\u2019 skill of manoeuvring the colonoscope could be reduced.\nIn comments to the Science Media Center (SMC), Catherine Menon, principal lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire\u2019s Department of Computer Science, said: \u201cAlthough de-skilling resulting from AI use has been raised as a theoretical risk in previous studies, this study is the first to present real-world data that might potentially indicate de-skilling arising from the use of AI in diagnostic colonoscopies.\u201d Menon raised concerns that overreliance on AI could leave health practitioners at risk to technological compromise.\nOther experts are more cautious about drawing conclusions from a single study.\nVenet Osmani, a professor of clinical AI and machine learning at Queen Mary University of London, noted to SMC that the total number of colonoscopies\u2014including both AI-assisted and non-AI-assisted ones\u2014increased over the course of the study. The increased workload, Osmani suggested, could have led to clinician fatigue and poorer detection rates.\nAllan Tucker, a professor of artificial intelligence at Brunel University of London, also noted that with AI assistance, clinician performance improved overall. Concerns about deskilling due to automation bias, added Tucker to SMC, \u201cis not unique to AI systems and is a risk with the introduction of any new technology.\u201d\n\u201cThe ethical question then is whether we trust AI over humans,\u201d said Tucker. \u201cOften, we expect there to be a human overseeing all AI decision-making but if the human experts are putting less effort into their own decisions as a result of introducing AI systems this could be problematic.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not simply about monitoring technology,\u201d says Ahmad. \u201cIt\u2019s about navigating the complexities of a new human-AI clinical ecosystem.\u201d Establishing safeguards is critical, he adds, suggesting that beyond this study, people may need to focus on \u201cpreserving essential skills in a world where AI becomes ubiquitous.\u201d"

      "text": "Why it\u2019s so hard to use AI to diagnose cancer\nThe latest effort, from the Mayo Clinic, holds some clues.\nThis story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.\nPeering into the body to find and diagnose cancer is all about spotting patterns. Radiologists use x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging to illuminate tumors, and pathologists examine tissue from kidneys, livers, and other areas under microscopes and look for patterns that show how severe a cancer is, whether particular treatments could work, and where the malignancy may spread.\nIn theory, artificial intelligence should be great at helping out. \u201cOur job is pattern recognition,\u201d says Andrew Norgan, a pathologist and medical director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s digital pathology platform. \u201cWe look at the slide and we gather pieces of information that have been proven to be important.\u201d\nVisual analysis is something that AI has gotten quite good at since the first image recognition models began taking off nearly 15 years ago. Even though no model will be perfect, you can imagine a powerful algorithm someday catching something that a human pathologist missed, or at least speeding up the process of getting a diagnosis. We\u2019re starting to see lots of new efforts to build such a model\u2014at least seven attempts in the last year alone\u2014but they all remain experimental. What will it take to make them good enough to be used in the real world?\nDetails about the latest effort to build such a model, led by the AI health company Aignostics with the Mayo Clinic, were published on arXiv earlier this month. The paper has not been peer-reviewed, but it reveals much about the challenges of bringing such a tool to real clinical settings.\nThe model, called Atlas, was trained on 1.2 million tissue samples from 490,000 cases. Its accuracy was tested against six other leading AI pathology models. These models compete on shared tests like classifying breast cancer images or grading tumors, where the model\u2019s predictions are compared with the correct answers given by human pathologists. Atlas beat rival models on six out of nine tests. It earned its highest score for categorizing cancerous colorectal tissue, reaching the same conclusion as human pathologists 97.1% of the time. For another task, though\u2014classifying tumors from prostate cancer biopsies\u2014Atlas beat the other models\u2019 high scores with a score of just 70.5%. Its average across nine benchmarks showed that it got the same answers as human experts 84.6% of the time.\nLet\u2019s think about what this means. The best way to know what\u2019s happening to cancerous cells in tissues is to have a sample examined by a pathologist, so that\u2019s the performance that AI models are measured against. The best models are approaching humans in particular detection tasks but lagging behind in many others. So how good does a model have to be to be clinically useful?\n\u201cNinety percent is probably not good enough. You need to be even better,\u201d says Carlo Bifulco, chief medical officer at Providence Genomics and co-creator of GigaPath, one of the other AI pathology models examined in the Mayo Clinic study. But, Bifulco says, AI models that don\u2019t score perfectly can still be useful in the short term, and could potentially help pathologists speed up their work and make diagnoses more quickly.\nWhat obstacles are getting in the way of better performance? Problem number one is training data.\n\u201cFewer than 10% of pathology practices in the US are digitized,\u201d Norgan says. That means tissue samples are placed on slides and analyzed under microscopes, and then stored in massive registries without ever being documented digitally. Though European practices tend to be more digitized, and there are efforts underway to create shared data sets of tissue samples for AI models to train on, there\u2019s still not a ton to work with.\nWithout diverse data sets, AI models struggle to identify the wide range of abnormalities that human pathologists have learned to interpret. That includes for rare diseases, says Maximilian Alber, cofounder and CTO of Aignostics. Scouring the publicly available databases for tissue samples of particularly rare diseases, \u201cyou\u2019ll find 20 samples over 10 years,\u201d he says.\nAround 2022, the Mayo Clinic foresaw that this lack of training data would be a problem. It decided to digitize all of its own pathology practices moving forward, along with 12 million slides from its archives dating back decades (patients had consented to their being used for research). It hired a company to build a robot that began taking high-resolution photos of the tissues, working through up to a million samples per month. From these efforts, the team was able to collect the 1.2 million high-quality samples used to train the Mayo model.\nThis brings us to problem number two for using AI to spot cancer. Tissue samples from biopsies are tiny\u2014often just a couple of millimeters in diameter\u2014but are magnified to such a degree that digital images of them contain more than 14 billion pixels. That makes them about 287,000 times larger than images used to train the best AI image recognition models to date.\n\u201cThat obviously means lots of storage costs and so forth,\u201d says Hoifung Poon, an AI researcher at Microsoft who worked with Bifulco to create GigaPath, which was featured in Nature last year. But it also forces important decisions about which bits of the image you use to train the AI model, and which cells you might miss in the process. To make Atlas, the Mayo Clinic used what\u2019s referred to as a tile method, essentially creating lots of snapshots from the same sample to feed into the AI model. Figuring out how to select these tiles is both art and science, and it\u2019s not yet clear which ways of doing it lead to the best results.\nThirdly, there\u2019s the question of which benchmarks are most important for a cancer-spotting AI model to perform well on. The Atlas researchers tested their model in the challenging domain of molecular-related benchmarks, which involves trying to find clues from sample tissue images to guess what\u2019s happening on a molecular level. Here\u2019s an example: Your body\u2019s mismatch repair genes are of particular concern for cancer, because they catch errors made when your DNA gets replicated. If these errors aren\u2019t caught, they can drive the development and progression of cancer.\n\u201cSome pathologists might tell you they kind of get a feeling when they think something\u2019s mismatch-repair deficient based on how it looks,\u201d Norgan says. But pathologists don\u2019t act on that gut feeling alone. They can do molecular testing for a more definitive answer. What if instead, Norgan says, we can use AI to predict what\u2019s happening on the molecular level? It\u2019s an experiment: Could the AI model spot underlying molecular changes that humans can\u2019t see?\nGenerally no, it turns out. Or at least not yet. Atlas\u2019s average for the molecular testing was 44.9%. That\u2019s the best performance for AI so far, but it shows this type of testing has a long way to go.\nBifulco says Atlas represents incremental but real progress. \u201cMy feeling, unfortunately, is that everybody's stuck at a similar level,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need something different in terms of models to really make dramatic progress, and we need larger data sets.\u201d\nNow read the rest of The Algorithm\nDeeper Learning\nOpenAI has created an AI model for longevity science\nAI has long had its fingerprints on the science of protein folding. But OpenAI now says it\u2019s created a model that can engineer proteins, turning regular cells into stem cells. That goal has been pursued by companies in longevity science, because stem cells can produce any other tissue in the body and, in theory, could be a starting point for rejuvenating animals, building human organs, or providing supplies of replacement cells.\nWhy it matters: The work was a product of OpenAI\u2019s collaboration with the longevity company Retro Labs, in which Sam Altman invested $180 million. It represents OpenAI\u2019s first model focused on biological data and its first public claim that its models can deliver scientific results. The AI model reportedly engineered more effective proteins, and more quickly, than the company\u2019s scientists could. But outside scientists can\u2019t evaluate the claims until the studies have been published.

      "text": "After more than a decade of development and testing, US military officials are finally ready to entrust United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket to haul a batch of national security satellites into space.\nAn experimental military navigation satellite, also more than 10 years in the making, will ride ULA's Vulcan rocket into geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.\nThe Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA's live launch webcast below.\nThe Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA's new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.\nNow, ULA is poised to begin ticking off a backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches the company has sold to commercial and government customers. The new rocket's largest users, by far, will be Amazon and the US Space Force.\nNew and improved\n\"We're excited to see this mission launch,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA's vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This will be the most powerful Vulcan yet.\"\nThe first two Vulcan test flights last year used a configuration of the rocket with two strap-on boosters to add an extra burst of speed off the launch pad. For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters fell off the launcher moments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit."

      "text": "Seaweed farming for carbon dioxide capture would take up too much of the ocean\nWe\u2019d need to use a huge amount of ocean space to get even close to hitting targets.\nIf we\u2019re going to prevent the gravest dangers of global warming, experts agree, removing significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is essential. That\u2019s why, over the past few years, projects focused on growing seaweed to suck CO2 from the air and lock it in the sea have attracted attention\u2014and significant amounts of funding\u2014from the US government and private companies including Amazon.\nThe problem: farming enough seaweed to meet climate-change goals may not be feasible after all.\nA new study, published today in Nature Communications Earth & Environment, estimates that around a million square kilometers of ocean would need to be farmed in order to remove a billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over the course of a year. It\u2019s not easy to come by that amount of space in places where seaweed grows easily, given all the competing uses along the coastlines, like shipping and fishing.\nTo put that into context, between 2.5 and 13 billion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide would need to be captured each year, in addition to dramatic reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions, to meet climate goals, according to the study\u2019s authors.\nA variety of scientific models suggest we should be removing anything from 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year to 29 billion tons by 2050 in order to prevent global warming levels from rising past 1. 5\u02daC. An 2017 report from the UN estimated that we\u2019d need to remove 10 billion tons annually to stop the planet from warming past 2\u02daC by the same date.\n\u201cThe industry is getting ahead of the science,\u201d says Isabella Arzeno-Soltero, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, who worked on the project. \u201cOur immediate goal was to see if, given optimal conditions, we can actually achieve the scales of carbon harvests that people are talking about. And the answer is no, not really.\u201d\nSeaweed pulls carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and then a significant amount is sequestered\u2014potentially for millennia\u2014when the plant matter eventually sinks down into the ocean depths. The idea is that it could be grown and then intentionally sunk to lock away that carbon long enough to ease the pressure on the climate.\nArzeno-Soltero and her colleagues at the University of California, Irvine, used a software model to estimate how much seaweed, of four different types, could be grown in oceans around the world.\nThe model considered things like the seaweed\u2019s nitrate uptake (which is essential for growth), the water temperature, the sun\u2019s intensity, and height of the sea\u2019s waves, using global ocean data gathered from past years, while accounting for current farming practices. The researchers performed more than 1,000 seaweed growth and harvest simulations for each of the seaweed types, which they said represented the \u201coptimistic upper bounds\u201d for seaweed production.\nFor example, the new estimates assumed that farming space could be found within the most productive waters for seaweed in the equatorial Pacific, around 200 nautical miles off the coast. In less productive locations, growing enough seaweed to reach climate targets would be even more challenging: three times as much space would have to be devoted to seaweed farming to sequester the same amount of carbon.\nTheir findings suggest that cultivating enough seaweed to reach these targets is beyond the industry\u2019s current capacity, although meeting climate goals will require much more than reliance solely on seaweed.\nAgnes Mols-Mortensen, a macroalgal biologist who farms seaweed in the Faroe Islands and was not involved in the project, says that companies hoping to expand their seaweed farming projects also needed to consider how that could affect the ocean ecosystem.\n\u201cWe should be careful not to overexploit the ocean like we have the land,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to build really solid methods based on research before we dream about saving the planet with seaweed. There\u2019s a lot of hype.\u201d\nDeep Dive\nClimate change and energy\nGoogle\u2019s electricity demand is skyrocketing\nThe tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power.

      "text": "Depending on your temperament, having a Michelin-starred chef drop by with something to throw on your back-garden barbecue might be a dream come true, or a bit of a nightmare. Will they judge us for buying ready-made coleslaw? Will they notice how excessively charred the drumsticks are? But chefs are people too \u2013 and they like being invited over for a burger and a beer just as much as the rest of us. It\u2019s just that their burgers might be made from dry-aged steak, minced by hand that morning, paired with a carefully chosen low-intervention wine.\nChefs also like thinking beyond burgers, sausages and all the other traditional barbecue favourites, which is why, when we asked 18 of the UK\u2019s best chefs what they would take to a barbecue, they recommended everything from chilli-spiked watermelon salad and intensely flavoured Korean marinades to dry non-alcoholic aperitifs and beautiful tins of spiced salt. (And not a tub of coleslaw in sight.)\nThe veggie barbie star\nI always bring a large head of cabbage \u2013 hispi if I can find it, but napa or white work well, too. I cut it into thick wedges (keeping the core intact so they don\u2019t fall apart), brush them with olive oil, season generously, and char directly over the flames until the outer leaves are blackened and blistered and the inside goes sweet and tender. Then I make a dressing: either whisk together tahini, a bit of yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic and water to make a creamy sauce, or simply use some creme fraiche with lemon juice and garlic stirred though. I spoon this over the cabbage and finish it off with whatever chilli oil or chilli sauce happens to be around, and a sprinkle of fresh herbs (only if I have them).\nYotam Ottolenghi, chef, restaurateur and food writer\nThrow a few prawns on the grill\nBarbecued prawns with harissa mayo make a perfect barbecue starter: place 1kg of raw shell-on tiger prawns in a bowl with two teaspoons of crushed cumin seeds, two tablespoons each of rose harissa paste and olive oil and the zest of two limes. Leave for 30 minutes. Make a sauce with 150g mayonnaise, two teaspoons of rose harissa paste, the juice of a lime and one tablespoon of chopped dill. Barbecue the marinated prawns for 2-3 minutes each side over the hottest part of the grill, until cooked through and lightly charred. Serve with the mayo and lime wedges.\nTom Kerridge, chef, restaurateur and author of The BBQ Book. His newest pub is The Chalk in London\nThe Italian barbecue go-to\nIn Italy, when we have a barbecue everyone brings something. My favourite at the moment is spring onions wrapped in streaky bacon. I wrap 20-30 individual spring onions in streaky bacon, chill and then transfer them straight on to the grill. The stems are perfectly salted due to the bacon and are delicious with a homemade spicy mayo.\nGiorgio Locatelli, Michelin-starred chef, who has a new restaurant at London\u2019s National Gallery\nJust add chilli \u2013 to everything\nI would never arrive at a barbecue without aj\u00ed (chilli) sauce: I always have a Kilner jar of it in the fridge. I make it with six large ripe vine tomatoes and 10 red chilies, blackened over the barbecue or in a hot dry pan, then mashed or blitzed with the juice of a lime and plenty of salt. I would also bring a spice mix from Field Blends: they do a delicious maple chilli salt, perfect for sprinkling over meats and salads and they come in handy little tins, so easy to pop in your bag.\nAna Ortiz, chef/co-founder of Fire Made in Somerset\nKnock up an Aperol spritz bar\nI love taking an Aperol spritz station to a barbecue. A rigid coolbox \u2013 so the lid can double up as a table \u2013 filled with ice, sliced oranges, Aperol, San Pellegrino and sparkling wine. I have a stash of Bonne Maman jam jars to use as glasses. I get no enjoyment from drinking anything \u2013 even champagne \u2013 from a paper or plastic cup. Sturdy glasses all the way.\nRukmini Iyer, chef and author of The Green Barbecue\nKebabs are kings\nA particular favourite is chicken or lamb kebabs, marinaded in yoghurt with spices overnight and then skewered with slices of lemon and red onion. With a salad of roast aubergine, cucumber, tomato, red onion and mint finished with a splash of red wine vinegar. And then sauces and flatbreads are king of the barbecue \u2013 tahini or chermoula work particularly well here. To drink, I love Small Beer or Jubel peach beer.\nJulius Roberts, chef, farmer and author of the Farm Diaries newsletter and the book The Farm Table\nCarry a watermelon \u2013 not just for dessert\nMy father carried watermelons as gifts to parties long before Baby in Dirty Dancing ever did. At this time of year when the weather is very hot, they are a perfect, big-bellied crowd-pleaser \u2013 so refreshing and rehydrating. They can be chopped up and turned into salads, too. I\u2019m partial to a dressing made with smashed garlic, birdseye chilli, palm sugar, fish sauce or soy, tamarind and lime juice; then add roasted cashews and fistfuls of Thai basil. To drink, I don\u2019t think you can do better than ros\u00e9.\nRavinder Bhogal, chef-patron of Jikoni and author of Comfort and Joy\nThe best fish for the job\nI would bring a whole turbot: it\u2019s one of the best things you can cook on a barbecue as its high collagen content keeps the fish moist, creating rich, gelatinous juices under the skin. Pat the fish dry and brush it with olive oil, season with salt, then place in a fish grill. Barbecue for about eight minutes a side.\nNiklas Ekstedt, Michelin-starred chef and founder of fire-based restaurant Ekstedt at the Yard in London\nGet a little salty\nTo make a barbecue go down a storm I arrive with a pot of Cornish smoked sea salt, which has a big smack of smoky flavour, and some Chimac sriracha caramel sauce, which you can glaze vegetables with or dip straight into. Condimaniac does brilliant rubs and sauces, but their best is an onion gravy ketchup. For drinks, Knightor vermouth is delicious \u2013 serve with an orange slice, olive and ice. Otherwise Yew\u2019s rhubarb-flavoured sparkling water is great if you\u2019re not drinking.\nLagom Chef (AKA Martyn Odell), chef and TikToker\nThe cover-all-bases marinade\nCortas pomegranate molasses is a perfect one-bottle marinade. It works its magic on chicken (wings in particular), lamb (we\u2019re thinking chops), pork or beef, or as a post-grill drizzle on your meat or vegetables for an instant sweet and sour seasoning.\nItamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer, chefs at Honey & Co and authors of Chasing Smoke: Cooking Over Fire Around the Levant\nYou can\u2019t beat a potato salad\nI love a good old potato salad at a barbecue. New potatoes boiled whole, thinly sliced fennel and red onion, lots of fresh dill and a dressing with unrefined sunflower oil, mustard, lemon and honey. Carrot and red pepper tapenade is also ideal with anything grilled. It\u2019s very simple: thinly sliced onions, red pepper and grated carrots are cooked down to a jammy consistency, seasoned with salt, sugar and smoked paprika, doused in olive oil and some red wine vinegar, then rested in the fridge overnight.\nAlissa Timoshkina, chef, food historian and author of Kapusta\nA non-alcoholic aperitivo\nBotivo is an alcohol-free drink for grownups, made from cider vinegar with botanicals. It\u2019s low in calories so it\u2019s quite healthy, but it can also be mixed with tequila. Also Slap ya Mama is a seasoning rub that I like to use liberally post-barbecuing.\nRichard Turner, chef, director at Bodean\u2019s and co-founder of the Meatopia barbecue food festival\nA beaujolais that goes with everything\nTrenel\u2019s red beaujolais, made from the Gamay grape, is perfect for grilled meat, fish and vegetables. I think it\u2019s wonderful chilled, so it\u2019s perfect for outdoor summer meals.\nMichel Roux Jr, Michelin-starred chef at Chez Roux and TV presenter\nPass the peas\nIn season, I take peas in their pods. You can grill them whole on the barbecue and then toss with sea salt, plenty of soft aromatic herbs, such as mint and dill, and serve to be eaten a little like edamame.\nTomos Parry, Michelin-starred chef of Brat and Mountain restaurants\nA showstopper of a salad\nI would take a big beany salad, one you can make at home and then take with you. It uses ingredients that will sit happily wallowing in their juices for at least a couple of hours and taste better as the flavours develop. Chopped fresh tomatoes, different colours and sizes, plus lots of fresh herbs, a good dressing, some jarred peppers or artichokes, and not forgetting my favourite \u2013 some big creamy butter beans. It only takes minutes to mix it all together, but you look like a hero when you place it on the table.\nClaire Thomson, chef and author of One Pan Beans\nBaked onions, Sicilian style\nIn Sicily, they bake whole unpeeled onions wrapped in foil, like potatoes, nestled in the embers, and let them get so soft they are almost a relish. I also often take peperonata, a multipurpose marinade, side or relish which is a cooked mix of tomatoes, onions and peppers.\nRachel Roddy, Rome-based chef and author of An A-Z of Pasta\nA spicy Korean twist\nWhenever I\u2019m going to a barbecue, the first thing I put in the cool box is Ssamjang Korean soybean paste. Made from a mix of gochujang and doenjang (fermented pastes), sesame oil and garlic, it makes a great marinade and is the ultimate dip for grilled meats, fish or vegetables. It\u2019s even better if you wrap it all up with raw chilli and garlic in a fresh salad leaf.\nKyu Jeon, chef-owner of Korean restaurants Bokman and Dongnae\nTake a cooling dip\nI always take a homemade dip. My favourite is a crispy spring onion one. I crisp a chopped bunch of spring onions in olive oil, add a half a teaspoon of turmeric, the same of dried chilli and a pinch of salt and sugar, then take off the heat. Once cool, ripple it over about 300g of salted thick Greek yoghurt.\nAnna Jones, chef and author of Easy Wins"

      "text": "This article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\nThe Tressless sub-Reddit is the internet\u2019s largest gathering place for the bald and balding. It has more than 400,000 members, many of them young men stunned that their follicles have betrayed them so early. They share photos of their thinning scalps, vent about their diminished sex lives and self-esteem, track infinitesimal fluctuations in the size of celebrities\u2019 foreheads, and ask questions like \u201cIs Propecia an acceptable name for a daughter?\u201d Mainly, they talk treatment: what works and, more often, what doesn\u2019t. \u201cI think I am done for,\u201d reads a representative post by a 21-year-old who tried the popular medications but kept shedding anyway. \u201cShould I shave it all and accept defeat?\u201d\nThe Tressless community\u2019s biggest frustration may be with the lack of progress. Technology has advanced in almost every other domain \u2014 we have self-driving cars, ChatGPT, and earbuds that translate foreign languages in real time \u2014 but the best hair-loss treatments are decades old and only marginally more effective than a good toupee. \u201cWTF have we been doing for the last 30 years?\u201d one redditor asked recently, prompting a 336-comment complaint session that at times showcased a surprising level of scientific fluency, with users citing journal articles, biochemical pathways, a broad spectrum of documented side effects, and the convoluted mechanics of FDA approval to explain the shortcomings of the current offerings.\nThere are the standbys, minoxidil (often known by its brand name Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia), which have been on the market since the \u201980s and \u201990s and are still the only drugs approved by the FDA for hair loss. They can help preserve the hair you have, but both come with downsides. To get the full benefits of topical minoxidil, you have to rub it into your scalp twice a day, every day, forever. There\u2019s a pill version, too, but it can cause dizziness and heart palpitations. Finasteride works better for some, but only for men, and only if they\u2019re comfortable with the risk of erectile dysfunction, which in some cases can be permanent. Dutasteride, finasteride\u2019s off-label nuclear-strength cousin, is more potent but equally deleterious to boners. Meanwhile, hair transplants can occasionally work wonders, but they\u2019re expensive and frequently require international travel. Then there are laser helmets, platelet-rich plasma injections, microneedling, and a galaxy of supplements, which tend to work better at enhancing primary treatments than on their own. No currently available treatment seems to work for everyone, and, crucially, none can reliably do the one thing everyone wants, which is regrow thick, mature hair on parts of the scalp that have already gone bald. Nothing ever has. Until \u2014 maybe \u2014 now.\nLast year, Tressless members started posting about a new potential treatment for hair loss that landed on their radar after the American Academy of Dermatology\u2019s annual meeting was rocked by some early trial data. The drug, called PP405, was developed by Pelage Pharmaceuticals, and it works differently than the usual medications. In pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, hair follicles don\u2019t disappear. They gradually shrink and start producing thinner, shorter \u201cvellus\u201d hairs instead of thick, pigmented \u201cterminal\u201d hairs. Eventually, they go dormant and stop producing hair altogether. Minoxidil and finasteride try to rescue those struggling follicles before they reach that point, the former by increasing blood flow, the latter by blocking the conversion of testosterone. But PP405 is more ambitious, aiming to revive follicles that have already shut down by reprogramming the metabolism of their stem cells. In theory, it doesn\u2019t just slow hair loss; it reactivates the parts of the scalp that have already surrendered \u2014 and seemingly without side effects.\nTressless has seen many so-called baldness cures come and go, so the initial response to PP405 was cautious. It\u2019s \u201cvery interesting\u201d and could represent \u201ca new mechanism of treating hair loss, if it bears out in further clinical studies,\u201d noted the first post to mention it in March 2024.\nBut the mood didn\u2019t stay cautious for long. As Tressless members dug into the science and began circulating screenshots from Pelage\u2019s website showing how quickly PP405 could work, the tone shifted to barely contained euphoria. By the time Pelage officially announced the impressive results of its Phase 2a trial this past June, the sub-Reddit had already declared PP405 the drug that would finally change everything. \u201cSprinkle that PP405 on my scalp like I sprinkle salt on my steak,\u201d one member wrote. \u201cBLESS PELAGE AND BLESS PP405 GIVE ME THAT SHIT RIGHT NOW,\u201d posted another. Someone even wrote a poem:\nr/Tressless, raise your balding heads,\nFor soon, we won\u2019t need those meds.\nFor perfect hairlines we strive,\nThe dead follicles we\u2019ll revive.\nThe reason I still cling to life?\nPee-pee-four-zero-five.\nOn some days, it seems like PP405 is the only thing Tressless wants to talk about. Threads dissecting its mechanism and trial design routinely draw hundreds of comments. In theory, the drug won\u2019t go to market for a few more years, and that\u2019s assuming it clears regulatory approval, which is far from guaranteed. But that hasn\u2019t stopped it from becoming the sub-Reddit\u2019s obsession, a vessel for all of its members\u2019 longing and desperation. As Ozempic and Viagra have made such age-old problems as obesity and impotence pharmacologically optional, could PP405 do the same for baldness? 400,000 redditors are praying it can.\nOf course, it\u2019s not just them. Pattern baldness affects roughly 80 percent of men and nearly half of women over the course of their lives. After decades of snake oil and broken promises, we may be approaching a real inflection point \u2014 not just in the science of hair loss but in how the world thinks about baldness itself. For centuries, losing your hair was considered one of life\u2019s cruelest fates and the only dignified thing to do about it was often nothing at all, since the available fixes \u2014 wigs, plugs, spray-on dye \u2014 were somehow even more humiliating. That logic is shifting. Imperfect though many of them still are, treatments are losing their stigma; people who haven\u2019t even started shedding are using minoxidil and finasteride prophylactically, and celebrities from LeBron James to Bradley Cooper to John Cena have seen their hairlines come triumphantly marching back, drawing praise instead of ridicule. Into this cultural moment comes PP405, possibly the big one, arriving just as we\u2019re finally ready to embrace it. We may not be at the end of baldness, exactly, but for the first time it feels within sight \u2014 the faint stubble of hope.\nThe Famous-Hair Renaissance That Could Be\nCelebrity stylist Chris McMillan has created some of the past decades\u2019 most recognizable haircuts, from the Rachel to Leslie Bibb\u2019s \u201ccunty little bob\u201d on \u2018The White Lotus.\u2019 (\u201cI\u2019ve probably at one point touched every celebrity except Sharon Stone and Madonna,\u201d he says.) We asked him to imagine how ten notable bald or balding men might wear their hair if it were to grow back. To build each look, McMillan took inspiration from Hollywood\u2019s finest \u2014 borrowing Michael B. Jordan\u2019s hair for Eric Adams, say, or 1970s Steve McQueen for Jeff Bezos.\nMost blockbuster drugs come out of large pharmaceutical companies, backed by years of research and armies of scientists. PP405 started with three UCLA professors, a few lucky encounters on campus, and some leftover flesh donated by cosmetic-surgery patients.\nIn 2013, Bill Lowry, a UCLA professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, was studying skin cancer in mice when he made an unrelated discovery: The mice\u2019s active hair-follicle stem cells showed unusually high activity of a metabolic enzyme called lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH. The enzyme was well known in cancer research, but it had never been studied in the context of hair growth. He shared the finding with his colleague Heather Christofk, a biological-chemistry professor whose office was nearby. Curious to see if LDH was doing something important, they procured a strain of genetically engineered mice that carried a \u201cfloxed\u201d LDHA gene, or one that could be switched off in specific cells with a drug. Breeding them produced offspring in which LDH could be disabled in hair-follicle stem cells. Then the researchers shut off the cells\u2019 LDH and shaved the mice. Normally, their fur would have grown back in four weeks. It never did.\n\u201cIn experimental settings,\u201d says Lowry, \u201cthe best way to figure out how something works is to turn it off and then turn it back on.\u201d So they flipped the switch in the other direction. Christofk hypothesized that one way to stimulate LDH would be to delete a gene that codes for something called the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, or MPC. MPC transports pyruvate, an important fuel molecule, into the mitochondria, where it\u2019s used for energy. Block that pathway, and pyruvate accumulates, and \u2014 by an elaborate chain of intracellular events that is beyond the scope of this article \u2014 LDH activity ramps up. To test the idea, Lowry and Christofk bred another set of mice in which they could shut off MPC in their hair-follicle stem cells. They shaved the animals. After just two weeks, one of Lowry\u2019s students noticed something odd. \u201cHey Bill,\u201d the student said, \u201cthese mice are turning blue.\u201d In mice, when hair follicles start waking up, they activate pigment cells in the skin. The color change indicated that new hair was on the way.\nThe next question was whether it could work in non-modified lab mice. So they tried dosing some with UK-5099, a chemical compound known to inhibit MPC. \u201cThe mice had tons of fur,\u201d Christofk says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, it\u2019s really working. It\u2019s growing hair crazy well.\u2019\u201d\nLowry and Christofk still can\u2019t say for sure whether LDH deficiency causes baldness. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve shown is that if you stimulate LDH activity in hair-follicle stem cells, the follicles are able to overcome the triggers of hair loss, whatever those triggers are, and start growing hair again,\u201d says Lowry. He offered this analogy: \u201cHair-follicle stem cells are like Batman, waiting to spring into action. They sit in their lair \u2014 the stem-cell niche \u2014 with special tools and capabilities but do not use them until they see the Bat-Signal in the sky. In a stressed, or aged, or hormonally imbalanced scalp, no one is putting out the signal, so Batman stays in his lair. An MPC blocker is like Alfred getting in Batman\u2019s face and telling him to go save the kitten in the tree or whatever.\u201d\nThe researchers weren\u2019t ready to declare victory yet, though. Plenty of drugs work in mice but don\u2019t in humans, foiled by differences in immune response, physiology, and, in the case of topical drugs, skin thickness. Human epidermis is at least ten times thicker than mouse skin and therefore harder to breach. UK-5099 had no trouble slipping through a mouse, but in people it might just sit on the surface. So the team needed a new compound to block MPC with the power to infiltrate human scalps.\nA little while later, Christofk attended a seminar on campus and happened to sit next to Michael Jung, a chemistry professor with a track record of translating lab science into real treatments; he had already created two FDA-approved drugs for prostate cancer. \u201cI said, \u2018Mike, you have to come work with Bill and me,\u2019\u201d remembers Christofk. \u201cHe came back to my office, looked at the structure of UK-5099 on my computer screen, and said, \u2018Yeah, we can make a drug out of that.\u2019\u201d\nJung went to work designing dozens of molecular variations of UK-5099. To test the compounds, Lowry\u2019s lab team applied them to freshly snipped human skin discarded by plastic-surgery clinics \u2014 a perk of being in L.A. \u201cWe started with belly skin from tummy tucks, which you can get by the yard,\u201d says Lowry, though only at certain times of year. \u201cSometimes the supplier would tell us, \u2018It\u2019s going to be a while, because we\u2019re entering summer and nobody wants scarring during bikini season.\u2019\u201d They soon found that skin removed during face-lifts worked better anyway. \u201cThe hair density was much higher in those, so that was a gold mine of hair-follicle stem cells,\u201d Lowry says. Ex vivo skin survives for only three or four days once separated from its host, which wasn\u2019t long enough to expect hair or even stubble. But as they applied Jung\u2019s molecules, the team saw follicle stem cells activate and divide, some within 24 hours, a sign they were hitting their target. Eventually they landed on one molecule, and in 2018, Lowry, Christofk, and Jung founded Pelage Pharmaceuticals, named for the French word for a coat of fur. They called their drug PP405, in honor of the L.A. freeway that connects them all to campus.\nBut was it safe? Blocking MPC in the scalp might jump-start hair growth, but no one knew what would happen if PP405 entered the bloodstream and made its way to other tissues. In 2023, the first human-safety trial began. Sixteen male participants applied a topical gel version of the compound to their scalps nightly for a week. No PP405 showed up in their blood, and no side effects were reported. A larger Phase 2a trial followed in 2024, this time with 78 men and women, some using the gel daily for four weeks, others a placebo. (Because the mechanism by which PP405 works is gender agnostic, Pelage could safely test it on both men and women from the outset.) Again, the drug stayed local and the participants stayed healthy. It was reassuring, though not completely unexpected. \u201cWe chose this molecule on purpose because it\u2019s not stable in the blood,\u201d says Christofk. \u201cBy the time we tried it on live humans, we\u2019d been feeding it to rats and pigs for months,\u201d adds Lowry, \u201cand none of them looked particularly sick.\u201d\nBut then came a surprise. The Phase 2a trial was designed primarily to test safety, not effectiveness, and the participants used the drug for only about a month. Even so, some of them started growing hair. Among men with more advanced baldness, 31 percent of those treated with PP405 saw their hair density increase by 20 percent or more by the eight-week mark. Those numbers might not sound earth-shattering, but minoxidil and finasteride typically take six months, and usually longer, to produce any visible difference. \u201cWe were blown away,\u201d says Qing Yu Christina Weng, Pelage\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cAfter just four weeks, you wouldn\u2019t expect any separation between the treatment group and the placebo group. And not only were they growing new hair where there wasn\u2019t any before, it wasn\u2019t peach fuzz or baby hair \u2014 it was proper, thick, terminal hair.\u201d (Regulations prevent Pelage from sharing before-and-after photos.)\nAccording to Weng, these initial trials have only begun to show what PP405 might be capable of. She suspects some of the participants who fell short of the 20 percent hair-density threshold during the eight-week window would have crossed it with more time. And while Pelage is currently focused on pattern baldness, Weng says the company\u2019s drug may help with other forms of hair loss too, including those caused by chemotherapy, menopause, perimenopause, and GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic \u2014 \u201cany hair-loss condition where the follicle is still preserved,\u201d she says.\nBut PP405 is far from a done deal, and there\u2019s still a long way to FDA approval. Early studies like this \u201care not designed to give the best sense of the overall efficacy of the medication,\u201d says Arash Mostaghimi, vice-chair of clinical trials and innovation at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital\u2019s dermatology department, who helped design PP405\u2019s Phase 2a trial. \u201cSo the results you\u2019re seeing are more like, \u2018Hey, by the way, we also saw this.\u2019 I understand the enthusiasm, and I was excited by the data as well, but drawing any firm conclusions or comparisons based on this study would be reading into the results too deeply.\u201d After all, scores of other drugs have seemed effective at this stage and fizzled later. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know whether the response to PP405 is durable, whether the hair that comes in is going to stay around,\u201d says George Cotsarelis, a dermatologist and stem-cell biologist at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThey only looked at it for a short period of time. At this point, a lot of things will look great, but at six months, not so much, and then at 12 months even less.\u201d\nInvestors, at least, are bullish. Pelage has raised more than $30 million so far, led by Google Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Alphabet. Phase 3 trials are set to begin in 2026. If the FDA continues to like what it sees, PP405, or whatever it would ultimately be called, could by some estimates reach the market a year or two after that.\nBut for those losing hair now, even a three-year wait might feel unbearable. None of the scientists behind PP405 are bald themselves \u2014 suspiciously, everyone at Pelage, in fact, has a beautiful head of hair \u2014 but they\u2019ve come to appreciate how deeply the condition can affect people. The three main researchers have been inundated with emails from strangers begging to join upcoming trials. (Under clinical-trial protocols, they\u2019re not allowed to know who\u2019s enrolled, much less handpick participants.) \u201cI\u2019ve lost the desire to live after this,\u201d one person wrote to Lowry in July. \u201cThere were no such cases in my family. In Russia, we have a lot of superstitions and everyone says that I\u2019m cursed. And the doctors I was treated by were reluctant and wanted to get money. I took out loans to try different types of treatment. At least tell me what I can do.\u201d\nThe Famous-Hair Renaissance That Could Be\nAbout seven or eight years ago, Bob started losing his hair. He noticed the bulk of the shedding after experimenting with steroids. (Bob is not his real name, and he insists on calling me from a blocked number, but he\u2019s fine with me telling you that he is 26, lives in North Carolina, and has an engineering degree.) Since then, he\u2019s worked his way through the usual gauntlet of treatments, starting with wellness-aisle remedies like rosemary oil \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not usually a big pro-medicine guy\u201d \u2014 and moving on to minoxidil and finasteride. The latter thickened his hair a bit but left him with a persistent \u201cball ache\u201d and a reduced libido. So he started looking for alternatives on the bleeding edge of science.\n\u201cI\u2019m on the Tressless sub-Reddit quite a bit, and for a long time I\u2019ve been tracking different experimental compounds,\u201d says Bob. \u201cI\u2019ve been following HMI-115 and GT20029\u201d \u2014 early-stage drug candidates targeting the usual active-but-flagging follicles \u2014 \u201cand I was watching pyrilutamide\u201d \u2014 which once looked promising but failed to outperform a placebo in its 2023 Phase 3 trial. Naturally, he was keeping tabs on PP405, too.\nThen, this past spring, Bob came across a post on Tressless about a compound called JXL-069. It had been mentioned in a 2021 academic paper by the inventors of PP405 as one of the UK-5099 analogs \u2014 later tested on face-lift skin \u2014 and the abstract had described it as showing \u201csignificant MPC inhibition activity.\u201d That led some redditors to speculate that JXL-069 might actually be the same molecule as PP405 \u2014 or at least a close relative. While the structure of PP405 remains under wraps, JXL-069\u2019s molecular recipe had been published, plain as day, in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. \u201cThere was a Tressless post that said, \u2018Has anyone tried JXL-069? It might be PP405,\u2019\u201d Bob says. \u201cSo I started doing my own research and reading the patents, and it made sense.\u201d\nIntrigued, Bob contacted a friend he\u2019d met on a peptides sub-Reddit who claimed to know how to source gray-market pharmaceuticals. Was it possible to synthesize a batch of JXL-069? His friend said it was. So Bob and 40 other Tressless members coordinated via Reddit DMs, pooled their money, and placed an order. His share \u2014 200 milligrams, $275 worth, enough to last at least a year \u2014 arrived in powdered form in a jar in his mailbox. \u201cI try not to ask my friend too many questions,\u201d Bob says, \u201cbut I know it comes from a lab in China to a lab in the U.S. and then he gets it from there.\u201d To make sure they weren\u2019t just buying powdered drywall, the group sent a sample to an analytical testing lab, which seemed to confirm that the structure matched the published descriptions of JXL-069. (He sent me a photo of the lab report to verify.) That was good enough for Bob.\nEven if it really is the active ingredient in PP405 \u2014 \u201cWe feel like this is definitely the right compound,\u201d Bob says \u2014 he couldn\u2019t just dump it on his scalp. Like any drug, it needs a delivery system, in this case a topical gel. PP405\u2019s gel formulation is proprietary, so the Reddit experimenters had to improvise.\u201cSome people in the group are using the gel that was used in the preclinical trials on mice, which we know from the studies,\u201d Bob says. \u201cIs that the same thing they used on humans? Maybe. Probably not. But at least we know it\u2019s been tested before.\u201d Others, including Bob, opted for a homemade mix using propylene glycol, a solvent found in topicals like minoxidil.\nHe started applying it before bedtime in mid-June and even bought a microscope to track his progress at the follicular level. \u201cI sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be putting this on my head if Pelage hadn\u2019t already tested it in humans,\u201d he says. \u201cWe placed our order before the Phase 2a results were announced, and I know that was still sketchy, but once they were, that gave me extra confidence.\u201d He stores the powder in his fridge to keep it from going bad and mixes a month\u2019s worth at a time.\nUnsurprisingly, Pelage Pharmaceuticals says it does not endorse the limited-phase trial happening in Bob\u2019s kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe they even figured out how to make such an analog,\u201d says Lowry. \u201cBut I can almost guarantee they are not treating themselves with PP405. Don\u2019t believe everything you see on the internet, and certainly don\u2019t put anything you see on the internet on your head.\u201d The same goes for the alleged dupes of PP405 that are already being hawked across TikTok and a number of websites, including one that claims to be selling JXL-082, another of the molecules used in Pelage\u2019s early experiments. \u201cPP405 is currently in clinical trials as a new chemical entity,\u201d Weng says. \u201cThe structure of the compound is patented and known only to Pelage and has not been disclosed. All platforms claiming to sell PP405 or equivalents are illegitimate, and we cannot verify what actual product is being sold.\u201d\nThe structure of PP405 isn\u2019t the only thing Pelage is keeping secret. Behind closed doors, the company is working on other as-yet-undisclosed projects with ambitions far beyond the scalp. PP405 is among the first clinically tested compounds built on the idea that reactivating dormant stem cells could unlock the body\u2019s own regenerative powers, \u201cand we see it as proof of concept,\u201d says Pelage CEO Daniel Gil. \u201cWe\u2019re actively investigating other potential applications of related compounds.\u201d Like what? \u201cI have to be a little careful, because there\u2019s patent stuff I don\u2019t want to step on,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you think about aging tissues in our body \u2014 can you get stem cells in those tissues to bring back some vigor?\u201d In other words, it\u2019s a good thing they started with hair because we\u2019ll want it when we\u2019re all living forever.\nThen again, that may not come to pass. This summer, the Trump administration abruptly froze $584 million in federal grants to UCLA \u2014 citing alleged civil-rights violations tied to antisemitism and affirmative action \u2014 and is now seeking a $1 billion settlement to restore the money. \u201cMy current basic-research grant from the National Institutes of Health, which is a continuation of the work that led to this discovery on alopecia, was suspended last week,\u201d Lowry tells me in early August. \u201cI don\u2019t know what interesting discoveries won\u2019t be made the longer this thing stays suspended.\u201d Even if that funding returns, there\u2019s another threat looming. Congress is considering a bill, proposed by Republican representatives in New York and Florida, that would bar federally funded research from using animals, including lab mice.\nAn end to such research in the U.S. might just inspire more guinea pigs like Bob, who, as the guardrails of the scientific Establishment fall off, may be armed by the internet with just enough information and confidence to get themselves in trouble. By late July, he\u2019d been taking JXL-069 \u2014 or whatever that is in his fridge \u2014 for five weeks, a week longer than any of Pelage\u2019s official trial participants took PP405. I messaged him on Reddit to see how it was going. No side effects so far: \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling strong about the lack of risks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s still early for any real new hairs to be coming in and thickened up to where they would be noticeable; however, I do feel like maybe some of my miniaturized hairs that were already there and growing are starting to thicken a little as well. Excited for the coming weeks to hopefully really know.\u201d"

      "text": "Were these ancient sites built by aliens? Here\u2019s why some people think so.\nFrom the Egyptian pyramids to the Nasca (Nazca) Lines, these ancient sites are some of the most enigmatic constructions on Earth.\nMysterious ancient sites dot every corner of Earth. Some of these archaeological sites seem to defy the technological capabilities of their time, either because they\u2019re too big, too heavy, or too complex.\nAs such, some suggest the ancient builders of the Egyptian pyramids, the Nasca Lines, and others were following an extraterrestrial instruction manual. Perhaps the hands that crafted these ancient structures weren\u2019t really of this world.\nTo be sure, it\u2019s fun to think about whether aliens have visited Earth. After all, humans are on the threshold of expanding our reach in space, and places like Mars are in our sight.\nBut the truth is, there\u2019s no evidence suggesting that aliens have ever been here. Invoking a supernatural explanation for some of the most monumental of human achievements skips over the ingenuity of prehistoric civilizations.\nHere are seven of the largest and most enigmatic structures on the planet.\nSacsayhuam\u00e1n\nOutside the old Inca capital of Cusco, a fortress called Sacsayhuam\u00e1n rests in the Peruvian Andes. The site was built from enormous stones that were chiseled and stacked together like a jigsaw puzzle. Some say Sacsayhuam\u00e1n could be the work of an ancient civilization that had a little help from interstellar friends.\n(Andean glaciers are melting, reshaping centuries-old Indigenous rituals)\nThe 1,000-year-old interlocking fortress walls are made of rocks that weigh as much as 220 tons each, and which were carried more than 20 miles before being lifted and fit into place with laser-like precision.\nHow an ancient culture accomplished such a feat of engineering is a fun little problem to solve. Turns out the Inca were as adept at building houses and fortified complexes as they were at watching the sky and keeping calendars.\nIn fact, Sacsayhuam\u00e1n isn\u2019t the only example of this intricate masonry. Similar walls exist throughout the Inca Empire, including one in Cusco where a 12-angled stone has been carefully wedged into place.\nMore recently, archaeologists have uncovered traces of the rope-and-lever system the Inca used to transport stones from their quarries to their cities\u2014a system that relied on strength and ingenuity, rather than alien architects.\n(This Inca girl was frozen for 500 years. She just got a new face.)\nNasca Lines\nOn a high and dry plateau some 200 miles southeast of Lima, more than hundreds of long, straight white lines are etched into the Peruvian desert, seemingly at random. Joining them are 430 geometric shapes, including figures of animals like a spider, a monkey, and a hummingbird. In recent years, scientists using AI technology have discovered 300 more glyphs.\nThe longest of the lines run straight as an arrow for miles. The biggest shapes stretch nearly 1,200 feet across and are best viewed from the air. Scientists suspect the Nasca (also spelled Nazca) Lines, a UNESCO World Heritage site, are as many as two millennia old.\n(Is World Heritage status enough to save endangered sites?)\nBecause of their age, size, visibility from above, and mysterious nature, the lines are often cited as one of the best examples of alien handiwork on Earth. Otherwise, how would people from the ancient world have been able to make such huge designs in the desert without being able to fly? And why?\nTurns out, it\u2019s rather easy to understand how. Called geoglyphs, these enigmatic designs are made by removing the top, rust-colored layer of rocks to expose the brighter white sand underneath.\nExplaining why is more difficult to comprehend. Scientists who first studied the lines in the early 1900s suspected they were made to align with constellations or solstices.\nHowever, more recent work suggests the Nasca Lines point to ceremonial or ritual sites related to water and fertility. In addition to being visible from the air, the shapes can be seen from surrounding foothills.\n(Go on a luxury rail journey through Peruvian mountains)\nEgyptian pyramids\nJust outside Cairo, in Giza, the most famous of Egypt\u2019s pyramids rise from the desert. Built during the Bronze Age more than 4,500 years ago, the Pyramids at Giza are monumental tombs where ancient queens and pharaohs are buried.\nBut how, exactly, did the Egyptians build these things? The Great Pyramid is made of millions of precisely hewn stones weighing at least two tons each. Even with today\u2019s cranes and other construction equipment, building a pyramid as big as that of Pharaoh Khufu would be a formidable challenge.\n(Scientists find evidence of ancient waterway beside Egypt\u2019s pyramids)\nThen there\u2019s the astronomical configuration of the pyramids in the temple complex. Archaeologist believe they align with the stars in Orion\u2019s Belt.\nAdditionally, alien theorists often point to the fact that these three pyramids are in much better shape than others built centuries later (never mind the amount of work that has gone into preserving them over the past several centuries).\nSo are Egypt\u2019s pyramids artifacts of aliens? Not exactly. It\u2019s true that scientists aren\u2019t quite sure how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids\u2014and especially how they did it so quickly. But there\u2019s ample evidence that these tombs are the work of thousands of earthly hands.\n(This ancient diary reveals how Egyptians built the Great Pyramid)\nStonehenge\nA huge circle of stones, some weighing as much as 50 tons, sits in the English countryside outside Salisbury. Known as Stonehenge, the Neolithic monument inspired Swiss author Erich von D\u00e4niken to suggest it was a model of the solar system that also functioned as an alien landing pad.\nAfter all, how else could those massive stones have ended up hundreds of miles from their home quarry?\n(See how Stonehenge may have been built)\nNo one knows what, exactly, the meaning of Stonehenge is. But, as with all the other sites in this collection, the explanation is not aliens. Instead, scientists have demonstrated it\u2019s actually possible to erect such things using technologies that would have been around 5,000 years ago, when the earliest structures at the site were built.\nAnd now, it appears as though the stones are aligned with solstices and eclipses, suggesting the Stonehenge builders were at least keeping an eye on the heavens, even if they didn\u2019t come from above.\nTeotihuac\u00e1n\nTeotihuac\u00e1n, meaning the \u201cCity of the Gods,\u201d is a sprawling, ancient city in Mexico that\u2019s best known for its pyramidal temples and astronomical alignments.\nBuilt more than 2,000 years ago, Teotihuac\u00e1n\u2019s age, size, and complexity can make it seem otherworldly, but it\u2019s very much the work of humans.\n(Why the idea that the Maya civilization \u2018collapsed\u2019 is wrong)\nScientists suspect that over centuries, a mix of cultures including Maya, Zapotec, and Mixtec built the city that could house more than 100,000 people.\nWith its murals, tools, transportation system, and evidence of advanced agricultural practices, Teotihuac\u00e1n is often considered much more technologically developed than should have been possible in pre-Aztec Mexico.\n(This fragile wetland is dying. Tour boats could be its unlikely savior.)\n- National Geographic Expeditions\nBy far, the most well known of Teotihuac\u00e1n\u2019s buildings is the massive Pyramid of the Sun. One of the largest such constructions in the Western Hemisphere, the pyramid\u2019s curious alignment is believed to be based on calendrical cycles.\nEaster Island\nThe enigmas surrounding the moai, Easter Island\u2019s fleet of large stone figures, pretty much follow the same narrative as the other sites described here: How in the world did the Rapa Nui make these figures more than 1,000 years ago? And how did the moai end up on Easter Island?\nCarved from stone, the nearly 900 human figures are sprinkled along the flanks of the island\u2019s extinct volcanoes. The figures average 13 feet tall and weigh 14 tons and appear to have been chiseled from the soft volcanic tuff found in the Rano Raraku quarry.\nThere, more than 400 statues are still in various states of construction, with some completed figures awaiting transportation to their intended resting place.\nThe reasons for carving the moai are mysterious, though they were likely sculpted for religious or ritual reasons. It\u2019s also not exactly clear what happened to the stone-crafting Rapa Nui.\nOne theory suggests their civilization succumbed to an environmental disaster of their own making. But a 2024 Columbia University study challenges that claim.\n(What it\u2019s like to hike to the end of the world in Chile)\nThe face on Mars\nSpotted by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976, the so-called \u201cFace on Mars\u201d is nearly two miles long and lies in a region called Cydonia, which separates the smooth plains of the Martian north from the more cratered terrain in the south.\n(Here\u2019s a practical guide to stargazing)\nAt the time of its discovery, scientists dismissed the \u201cface\u201d as shadow play. Over the decades, however, it has become a favorite among those who suspect aliens with a penchant for building things have been visiting the solar system.\nIn 2001, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor took another good look at the face\u2014using a much higher resolution camera\u2014and saw \u2026 no face. Turns out that what had appeared to be a face is just another boring old Martian mesa, not unlike the landforms that litter the U.S. Southwest.\n(Find the ancient heart of America on this southwestern road trip)\nStill, the existence of such wondrous ancient sites\u2014whether in outer space or here on Earth\u2014is fun to ponder."

That\u2019s the hope, according to recommendations for the public included in a press release today from the National Drought Group.\nThere are far bigger steps companies and policymakers can take to conserve water of course, but drought has gotten bad enough for officials to urge the average person to consider how their habits might help or hurt the situation. And the proliferation of data centers is raising concerns about how much water it takes to power servers and keep them cool.\n\u201cSimple, everyday choices \u2013 such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails \u2013 also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife,\u201d Helen Wakeham, Environment Agency Director of Water, said in the press release.\n\u201cSimple, everyday choices \u2013 such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails \u2013 also really helps the collective effort\u201d\nThe Environment Agency didn\u2019t immediately respond to an inquiry from The Verge about how much water it thought deleting files might save, nor how much water data centers that store files or train AI use in the UK\u2019s drought-affected areas.\nA small data center has been estimated to use upwards of 25 million liters of water per year if it relies on old-school cooling methods that allow water to evaporate. To be sure, tech companies have worked for years to find ways to minimize their water use by developing new cooling methods. Microsoft, for example, has tried placing a data center at the bottom of the sea and submerging servers in fluorocarbon-based liquid baths.\nGenerating electricity for energy-hungry data centers also uses up more water since fossil fuel power plants and nuclear reactors also need water for cooling and to turn turbines using steam, an issue that transitioning to more renewable energy can help to address.\nAugust ushered in the UK\u2019s fourth heatwave of the summer, exacerbating what was already the driest six months leading to July since 1976. Five regions of the UK have officially declared drought, according to the release, while another six areas are in the midst of \u201cprolonged dry weather.\u201d\nThe National Drought Group says pleas to residents to save water have made a difference. Water demand dropped by 20 percent from a July 11th peak in the Severn Trent area after \u201cwater-saving messaging,\u201d according to the release. Plugging leaks is another major concern. Fixing a leaking toilet can prevent 200 to 400 liters of water from being wasted each day, it says."

      "text": "Why Trump\u2019s \u201cgolden dome\u201d missile defense idea is another ripped straight from the movies\nPresident Trump has proposed building an antimissile \u201cgolden dome\u201d around the United States. But do cinematic spectacles actually enhance national security?\nIn 1940, a fresh-faced Ronald Reagan starred as US Secret Service agent Brass Bancroft in Murder in the Air, an action film centered on a fictional \u201csuperweapon\u201d that could stop enemy aircraft midflight. A mock newspaper in the movie hails it as the \u201cgreatest peace argument ever invented.\u201d The experimental weapon is \u201cthe exclusive property of Uncle Sam,\u201d Reagan\u2019s character declares.\nMore than 40 years later, this cinematic vision\u2014an American superweapon capable of neutralizing assaults and ushering in global peace\u2014became a real-life centerpiece of Reagan\u2019s presidency. Some have suggested that Reagan\u2019s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a quixotic plan for a space-based missile shield, may have been partly inspired by his silver-screen past; indeed, the concept was so fantastical it\u2019s now better known by its Hollywood-referencing nickname, \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\nIn January 2024, Donald Trump revived the space-shield dream at a primary campaign rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, using the Star Wars nickname that Reagan hated. It didn\u2019t work in the 1980s, Trump said, because the technology wasn\u2019t there. But times have changed.\nWhether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump\u2019s impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many things. I\u2019ve seen shots that you wouldn\u2019t even believe,\u201d Trump said. He acted out a scene of missile defense experts triangulating the path of an incoming weapon. \u201cDing, ding, ding, ding,\u201d he said, as he mimed typing on a keyboard. \u201cMissile launch? Psshing!!\u201d He raised his hand to indicate the rising missile, then let it fall to signal the successful interception: \u201cBoom.\u201d\nTrump has often expressed admiration for Israel\u2019s Iron Dome, an air defense system that can intercept short-range rockets and artillery over the small nation and that is funded in part by the United States. At the rally, he pledged to \u201cbuild an Iron Dome over our country, a state-of-the-art missile defense shield made in the USA \u2026 a lot of it right here in New Hampshire, actually.\u201d\nWithin a week of his inauguration, President Trump began working toward this promise by issuing an executive order to develop \u201cThe Iron Dome for America,\u201d which was rebranded the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d a month later. The eruption of a revived conflict between Israel and Iran in June\u2014including Trump\u2019s decision to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities\u2014has only strengthened the case for an American version of the Iron Dome in the eyes of the administration.\nThe Golden Dome has often been compared to SDI for its futuristic sheen, its aggressive form of protection, and its reflection of the belief that an impenetrable shield is the cheat code to global peace. Both efforts demonstrate the performative power of spectacle in defense policy, especially when wielded by deft showmen like Reagan and Trump. Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump\u2019s impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure, often rendered in deceptively simple concept art depicting a society made immune to catastrophic strikes.\nBut in the complicated security landscape confronting the world today, is spectacle the same as safety?\n\u201cMissile defense is an area where facts and fiction blend,\u201d says Anette Stimmer, a lecturer in international relations at the University of St Andrews who has researched SDI. \u201cA lot is up to interpretation by all the actors involved.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s view is simple: Space is as much a warfighting domain as land, air, and ocean, and therefore the US must assert its dominance there with advanced technologies. This position inspired the creation of the US Space Force in his first term, and Trump has now redoubled his efforts with the ongoing development of the Golden Dome.\nGeneral Michael Guetlein, who Trump has appointed to lead the Golden Dome project, argued that America\u2019s foes, including China and Russia, have forced the nation\u2019s hand by continually pushing limits in their own weapons programs. \u201cWhile we have been focused on peace overseas, our adversaries have been quickly modernizing their nuclear forces, building out ballistic missiles capable of hosting multiple warheads; building out hypersonic missiles capable of attacking the United States within an hour and traveling at 6,000 miles an hour; building cruise missiles that can navigate around our radar and our defenses; and building submarines that can sneak up on our shores; and, worse yet, building space weapons,\u201d Guetlein said in May.\n\u201cIt is time that we change that equation and start doubling down on the protection of the homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cGolden Dome is a bold and aggressive approach to hurry up and protect the homeland from our adversaries. We owe it to our children and our children\u2019s children to protect them and afford them a quality of life that we have all grown up enjoying.\u201d\nWith that vision in mind, Trump\u2019s executive order outlines a host of goals for missile defense, some of which support bipartisan priorities like protecting supply chains and upgrading sensor arrays. The specific architecture of the Golden Dome is still being hammered out, but the initial executive order envisions a multi-tiered system of new sensors and interceptors\u2014on the ground, in the air, and in space\u2014that would work together to counter the threat of attacks from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. The system would be coordinated in part by artificial-intelligence models trained for real-time threat detection and response.\nThe technology that links the Golden Dome directly to SDI hinges on one key bullet point in the order that demands the \u201cdevelopment and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept.\u201d This language revives Reagan\u2019s dream of deploying hundreds of missile interceptors in orbit to target missiles in the boost phase right after liftoff, a window of just a few minutes when the projectiles are slower and still near the attacker\u2019s territory.\nSpace weapons are an attractive option for targeting the boost phase because interceptors need to be close enough to the launching missile to hit it. If a nation fired off long-range missiles from deep in its territory, the nearest ground- or air-based interceptors could be thousands of miles from the launch site. Space interceptors, in contrast, would be just a few hundred miles overhead of the ascending missiles, allowing for a much faster reaction time. But though the dream of boost-phase interception dates back decades, these maneuvers have never been operationally demonstrated from ground, air, or space.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really hard problem that hasn\u2019t been solved,\u201d says Laura Grego, senior scientist and research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 global security program.\nThe US is currently protected by the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), which consists of 44 interceptor missiles split between bases in Alaska and California, along with a network of early-warning sensors on the ground, at sea, and in orbit. Tests suggest that the GMD would have about a 50% success rate at intercepting missiles.\nInitiated by President Bill Clinton in the late \u201990s and accelerated by President George W. Bush in the 2000s, the GMD is intended mainly to defend against rogue states like North Korea, which has nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the US. A secondary focus is Iran, which does not currently have a nuclear weapon or ICBMs. Still, the GMD is built to anticipate a possible future where it develops those capabilities.\nThe GMD is not designed to protect the US from the sort of large-scale and coordinated missile attacks that Russia and China could lob across the world. The Bush administration instead favored a focus on strategic deterrence with these peer nations, an approach that the Obama and Biden administrations continued. In addition to the GMD, the Pentagon and its international partners maintain regional defense systems to counter threats in conflict hot spots or attacks on critical infrastructure. All these networks are designed to intercept missiles during their midcourse cruise phase, as they hurtle through the sky or space, or during their terminal or reentry phase, as they approach their targets. The GMD has cost upward of $63 billion since it was initiated, and the US spends about an additional $20 billion to $30 billion annually on its array of other missile defense systems.\nIn May, Trump was presented with several design options for the Golden Dome and selected a plan with a price tag of $175 billion and a schedule for full deployment by the end of his term. The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law on July 4, approved an initial $24.4 billion in funding for it. Space technologies and launch access have become much more affordable since the 1980s, but many analysts still think the projected cost and timeline are not realistic. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency, projected that the cost of the space-based interceptors could total from $161 billion to $542 billion over the course of 20 years. The wide range can be explained by the current lack of specifics on those orbital interceptors\u2019 design and number.\nReintroducing the idea of space-based interceptors is \u201cprobably the most controversial piece of Golden Dome,\u201d says Leonor Tomero, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy in the Biden administration.\n\u201cThere are a lot of improvements that we can and should make on missile defense,\u201d she continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of capability gaps I think we do need to address. My concern is the focus on reviving Star Wars and SDI. It\u2019s got very significant policy implications, strategic stability implications, in addition to cost implications and technology feasibility challenges.\u201d\nIndeed. Regardless of whether the Golden Dome materializes, the program is already raising geopolitical anxieties reminiscent of the Cold War era. Back then, the US had one main adversary: the Soviet Union. Now, it confronts a roiling multipolarity of established and nascent nuclear powers. Many of them have expressed dismay over the about-face on American missile defense strategy, which was previously predicated on arms reduction and deterrence.\n\u201cHere we are, despite years of saying we are not going to do this\u2014that it is technically out of reach, economically unsustainable, and strategically unwise,\u201d Grego says. \u201cOvernight, we\u2019re like, \u2018No, actually, we\u2019re doing it.\u2019\u201d\nThe fact that we \u201cblew up that logic\u201d will \u201chave a big impact on whether or not the program actually succeeds in creating the vision that it lays out,\u201d she adds.\nRussian and Chinese officials called the Golden Dome \u201cdeeply destabilizing in nature\u201d in a joint statement in May, and North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry warned it could \u201cturn outer space into a potential nuclear war field.\u201d\nReagan, by all accounts, believed that SDI would be the ultimate tool of peace for all nations, and he even offered to share the technology with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Trump, in contrast, sees Golden Dome as part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d brand. He has lamented that past American leaders supported the development of other missile defense projects abroad while neglecting to build similar security measures for their own country. The Golden Dome is both an expression of Trump\u2019s belief that the world is leeching off America and a bargaining chip in negotiations toward a new power balance; Canada could be covered by the shield for free, he has said\u2014in exchange for becoming the 51st state.\nTrump has argued that America has been both demographically diluted by unchecked immigration and financially depleted by freeloading allied nations\u2014undermining its security on both internal and external fronts. His first term\u2019s marquee promise to build a wall on the southern US border, paid for by Mexico, aimed to address the former problem. That administration did build more physical barriers along the border (though US taxpayers, not Mexico, footed the bill). But just as important, the wall emerged as a symbolic shorthand for tougher immigration control.\nThe Golden Dome is the second-term amplification of that promise, a wall that expands the concept of the \u201cborder\u201d to the entire American airspace. Trump has projected an image of his envisioned space missile shield as a literal dome that could ward off coordinated attacks, including boost-phase interceptors from space and cruise- and terminal-phase interception by ground and air assets. When he announced the selected plan from the Resolute Desk in May, he sat in front of a mockup that depicted a barrage of incoming missiles being thwarted by the nationwide shield, depicted with a golden glow.\nThe Golden Dome\u2019s orbital interceptors are supposedly there to target the early boost phase of missiles on or near the launch site, not over the United States. But the image of a besieged America, repelling enemy fire from the heavens, provides the visual and cinematic idea of both threat and security that Trump hopes to impress on the public.\n\u201cThis administration, and MAGA world, thinks about itself as being victimized by immigrants, government waste, leftist professors, and so on,\u201d says Edward Tabor Linenthal, a historian who examined public narratives about SDI in his 1989 book Symbolic Defense: The Cultural Significance of the Strategic Defense Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a jump to be victimized by too many nations getting nuclear weapons.\u201d\nEven in our era of entrenched political polarization, there is support across party lines for upgrading and optimizing America\u2019s missile defense systems. No long-range missile has ever struck US soil, but an attack would be disastrous for the nation and the world.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in terms of missile defense,\u201d says Tomero. \u201cThere has been a lot of bipartisan consensus on increasing regional missile defense, working with our allies, and making sure that the missile defense interceptors we have work.\u201d\nTrump has challenged that consensus with his reversion to the dream of a space shield. He is correct that SDI failed to materialize in part because its envisioned technologies were out of reach, from a financial and engineering standpoint, in the 1980s. But the controversy that erupted around SDI\u2014and that tarnished it with the derisive name \u201cStar Wars\u201d\u2014stemmed just as much from its potential geopolitical disruptiveness as from its fantastical techno-optimism.\n\u201cThis idea of a missile shield, also back when Reagan proposed it, has a huge popular appeal, because who wouldn\u2019t want to be able to defend your country from nuclear weapons? It is a universal dream,\u201d says Stimmer. \u201cIt requires a bit more digging in and understanding to see that actually, this vision depends a lot on technological feasibility and on how others perceive it.\u201d\nReagan maintained a steadfast conviction that this shield of space-based interceptors would render nuclear weapons \u201cimpotent and obsolete,\u201d ushering in \u201cworld peace,\u201d as he said in his March 1983 speech announcing SDI. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction could be replaced by mutually assured survival, he argued.\nAmid nuclear tensions, J. Robert Oppenheimer compared the US and the Soviet Union to \u201ctwo scorpions in a bottle.\u201d Now there are many more scorpions.\nBut Gorbachev saw the space-based shield as an offensive weapon, since it would give the US a first-strike advantage. The imbalance, he warned, could spark a weapons race in space, a domain that had been spared from overt military conflicts. As a result, the initiative would only destabilize the world order and interrupt the progress of arms control and nuclear de-proliferation efforts.\nReagan\u2019s insistence on SDI as the only route to world peace may have blocked opportunities to advance that goal through more practical and cost-effective avenues, such as diplomacy and arms control. At the 1986 Reykjavik Summit, Reagan and Gorbachev came very close to an arms control agreement that might have eliminated all ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The sticking point was Reagan\u2019s refusal to give up SDI.\n\u201cIt is not the Strategic Defense Initiative; it\u2019s a strategic defense ideology,\u201d says Linenthal. He mentions the famous metaphor used by J. Robert Oppenheimer, a central figure of the Manhattan Project, who compared the United States and the Soviet Union to \u201ctwo scorpions in a bottle.\u201d Either scorpion could kill the other, but only at the probable cost of its own life.\nReagan felt a \u201ctremendously powerful impetus\u201d to escape Oppenheimer\u2019s metaphor, Linenthal noted: \u201cIt was a new kind of deliverance that would resolve it all. Of course, now there are many more scorpions, so it has to be a bigger bottle.\u201d\nA true believer, Reagan never abandoned SDI in spite of cost overruns and public backlash. President Bill Clinton redirected the program in 1993 by shifting gears from global to regional missile defense, a focus that remained fairly consistent for decades\u2014until Trump took center stage. Now, the Golden Dome has flipped that logic on its head, risking a possible escalation of military tensions in outer space.\nTomero describes a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d in which adversaries attack the Golden Dome\u2019s space infrastructure, leaving the orbital environment filled with debris that renders the defense system, among countless other space assets, inoperable.\n\u201cHaving a one-sided capability that is very threatening to our adversaries is obviously going to create very dangerous stability issues,\u201d she says. It could \u201clead to inadvertent escalation and miscalculation and, I think, lower the threshold to conflict and nuclear war.\u201d\nAs president, Trump has channeled the boardroom antics that once resuscitated his celebrity status on The Apprentice. But armed adversaries, long wary of America\u2019s position on missile defense, don\u2019t have the luxury of wondering whether it\u2019s all real or just more stagecraft.\n\u201cWhat makes Trump so difficult to read for others is his unpredictability,\u201d Stimmer says. \u201cThis, just by itself, destabilizes things, because no one knows what he\u2019ll actually do.\u201d\nTrump has described the Golden Dome as nearly impenetrable by missile attacks, evoking a clear symbolic return to an American golden age where we can all feel safe again.\n\u201cAll of them will be knocked out of the air,\u201d as \u201cthe success rate is very close to 100%,\u201d he said at the project\u2019s official launch in May. \u201cWe will truly be completing the job that President Reagan started 40 years ago, forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.\u201d\nBecky Ferreira is a science reporter based in upstate New York, and author of First Contact, a book about the search for alien life, which will be published in September.\nKeep Reading\nMost Popular\nWe\u2019re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the body\nGLP-1 agonists like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro might benefit heart and brain health\u2014but research suggests they might also cause pregnancy complications and harm some users.\nExclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that\u2019s over 30 years old\nThe embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian \u201cembryo adoption\u201d agency.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "- Some ChatGPT users asked for its old \"yes man\" tone back for its support, Sam Altman said.\n- Altman said OpenAI has an \"enormous amount of power\" because a small tweak can affect billions of chats.\n- OpenAI launched GPT-5 with four new personality options for users on Thursday.\nSome ChatGPT users were so attached to the chatbot's \"yes man\" style that they asked OpenAI to bring it back, Sam Altman has said.\nThe OpenAI CEO said there was a \"heartbreaking\" reason \u2014 because some users said they had never had anyone support them before.\n\"Here is the heartbreaking thing. I think it is great that ChatGPT is less of a yes man and gives you more critical feedback,\" Altman said on Cleo Abram's \"Huge Conversations\" podcast, which aired Friday.\n\"But as we've been making those changes and talking to users about it, it's so sad to hear users say, 'Please can I have it back? I've never had anyone in my life be supportive of me. I never had a parent tell me I was doing a good job.'\"\nAltman said that users told him ChatGPT's old style had \"encouraged\" them to make changes in their lives. \"I can get why this was bad for other people's mental health, but this was great for my mental health,\" Altman recalled some of the users saying.\nIt follows OpenAI's efforts to rein in what it called \"sycophantic\" behaviour in ChatGPT. In April, the company said an update to its GPT-4o model had made it \"overly flattering or agreeable\" and \"disingenuous.\"\nAt the time, Altman said the bot's personality had become \"too sycophant-y and annoying\" and said fixes were on the way. Users had posted examples of the chatbot gushing over mundane prompts with praise like \"absolutely brilliant\" and \"you are doing heroic work.\"\nOn the podcast, Altman also acknowledged the scale of influence that comes with even small changes to ChatGPT's tone. \"One researcher can make some small tweak to how ChatGPT talks to you \u2014 or talks to everybody \u2014 and that's just an enormous amount of power for one individual making a small tweak to the model personality,\" he said.\n\"We've got to think about what it means to make a personality change to the model at this kind of scale,\" he added.\nIt's not the first time he's raised concerns about how much people lean on the chatbot. Speaking at a Federal Reserve event in July, Altman said some people, particularly younger users, had developed a worrying \"emotional over-reliance\" on ChatGPT.\n\"There's young people who say things like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me, it knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me,\" Altman said.\nOn Thursday, OpenAI rolled out GPT-5, the company's latest model that Altman called a \"major upgrade.\"\nHe said on the \"Huge Conversations\" podcast that over time, GPT-5 would feel more integrated into daily life and be more like a \"proactive\" companion. \"Maybe you wake up in the morning and it says, 'Hey, this happened overnight. I noticed this change on your calendar.' Or, 'I was thinking more about this question you asked me. I have this other idea,'\" he said.\nThe update also added four optional \"personality\" modes \u2014 Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd \u2014 each with a distinct tone, and which can be fine-tuned to match a user's preferences."

      "text": "DOGE\u2019s tech takeover threatens the safety and stability of our critical data\nElon Musk may have run tech companies, but building technology for government is an entirely different beast.\nTech buzzwords are clanging through the halls of Washington, DC. The Trump administration has promised to \u201cleverage blockchain technology\u201d to reorganize the US Agency for International Development, and Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE has already unleashed an internal chatbot to automate agency tasks\u2014with bigger plans on the horizon to take over for laid-off employees. The executive order that created DOGE in the first place claims the agency intends to \u201cmodernize Federal technology and software.\u201d But jamming hyped-up tech into government workflows isn\u2019t a formula for efficiency. Successful, safe civic tech requires a human-centered approach that understands and respects the needs of citizens. Unfortunately, this administration laid off all the federal workers with the know-how for that\u2014seasoned design and technology professionals, many of whom left careers in the private sector to serve their government and compatriots.\nWhat\u2019s going on now is not unconventional swashbuckling\u2014it\u2019s wild incompetence. Musk may have run plenty of tech companies, but building technology for government is an entirely different beast. If this administration doesn\u2019t change its approach soon, American citizens are going to suffer far more than they probably realize.\nMany may wince remembering the rollout of Healthcare.gov under the Obama administration. Following passage of the Affordable Care Act, Healthcare.gov launched in October of 2013 to facilitate the anticipated wave of insurance signups. But enormous demand famously took down the website two hours after launch. On that first day, only six people were able to complete the registration process. In the wake of the mess, the administration formed the US Digital Service (USDS) and 18F, the digital services office of the General Services Administration. These agencies\u2014the ones now dismantled at the hands of DOGE\u2014pulled experienced technologists from industry to improve critical infrastructure across the federal government, including the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs.\nOver the last decade, USDS and 18F have worked to build safe, accessible, and secure infrastructure for the people of the United States. DirectFile, the free digital tax filing system that the IRS launched last year, emerged from years of careful research, design, and engineering and a thoughtful, multi-staged release. As a result, 90% of people who used DirectFile and responded to a survey said their experience was excellent or above average, and 86% reported that DirectFile increased their trust in the IRS. Recently, Sam Corcos, a DOGE engineer, told IRS employees he plans to kill the program. When 21 experienced technologists quit their jobs at USDS in January after their colleagues were let go, they weren\u2019t objecting on political grounds. Rather, they preferred to quit rather than \u201ccompromise core government services\u201d under DOGE, whose orders are incompatible with USDS\u2019s original mission.\nAs DOGE bulldozes through technological systems, firewalls between government agencies are collapsing and the floodgates are open for data-sharing disasters that will affect everyone. For example, the decision to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to IRS data and to databases of unaccompanied minors creates immediate dangers for immigrants, regardless of their legal status. And it threatens everyone else, albeit perhaps less imminently, as every American\u2019s Social Security number, tax returns, benefits, and health-care records are agglomerated into one massive, poorly secured data pool.\nThat\u2019s not just speculation. We\u2019ve already seen how data breaches at companies like Equifax can expose the sensitive information of hundreds of millions of people. Now imagine those same risks with all your government data, managed by a small crew of DOGE workers without a hint of institutional knowledge between them.\nMaking data sets speak to each other is one of the most difficult technological challenges out there. Anyone who has ever had to migrate from one CRM system to another knows how easy it is to lose data in the process. Centralization of data is on the administration\u2019s agenda\u2014and will more than likely involve the help of contracting tech companies. Giants like Palantir have built entire business models around integrating government data for surveillance, and they stand to profit enormously from DOGE\u2019s dismantling of privacy protections. This is the playbook: Gut public infrastructure, pay private companies millions to rebuild it, and then grant those companies unprecedented access to our data.\nDOGE is also coming for COBOL, a programming language that the entire infrastructure of the Social Security Administration is built on. According to reporting by Wired, DOGE plans to rebuild that system from the ground up in mere months\u2014even though the SSA itself estimated that a project like that would take five years. The difference in those timelines isn\u2019t due to efficiency or ingenuity; it\u2019s the audacity of na\u00efvet\u00e9 and negligence. If something goes wrong, more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits will feel it where it hurts. Any delay in a Social Security payment can mean the difference between paying rent and facing eviction, affording medication or food and going without.\nThere are so many alarms to ring about the actions of this administration, but the damage to essential technical infrastructure may be one of the effects with the longest tails. Once these systems are gutted and these firewalls are down, it could take years or even decades to put the pieces back together from a technical standpoint. And since the administration has laid off the in-house experts who did the important and meticulous work of truly modernizing government technology, who will be around to clean up the mess?\nLast month, an 83-year-old pastor in hospice care summoned her strength to sue this administration over its gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we can follow her example. Former federal tech workers have both the knowledge and the legal standing to challenge these reckless tech initiatives. And everyday Americans who rely on government services, which is all of us, have a stake in this fight. Support the lawyers challenging DOGE\u2019s tech takeover, document and report any failures you encounter in government systems, and demand that your representatives hold hearings on what\u2019s happening to our digital infrastructure. It may soon be too late.\nSteven Renderos is the executive director of Media Justice.\nCorrection: Due to a CMS error, this article was originally published with an incorrect byline.

      "text": "Palmer Luckey on the Pentagon\u2019s future of mixed reality\nWhat a floundering military goggle project reveals about where our experiences with the technology are headed next, according to the founder of Oculus.\nPalmer Luckey has, in some ways, come full circle.\nHis first experience with virtual-reality headsets was as a teenage lab technician at a defense research center in Southern California, studying their potential to curb PTSD symptoms in veterans. He then built Oculus, sold it to Facebook for $2 billion, left Facebook after a highly public ousting, and founded Anduril, which focuses on drones, cruise missiles, and other AI-enhanced technologies for the US Department of Defense. The company is now valued at $14 billion.\nNow Luckey is redirecting his energy again, to headsets for the military. In September, Anduril announced it would partner with Microsoft on the US Army\u2019s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), arguably the military\u2019s largest effort to develop a headset for use on the battlefield. Luckey says the IVAS project is his top priority at Anduril.\n\u201cThere is going to be a heads-up display on every soldier within a pretty short period of time,\u201d he told MIT Technology Review in an interview last week on his work with the IVAS goggles. \u201cThe stuff that we\u2019re building\u2014it\u2019s going to be a big part of that.\u201d\nThough few would bet against Luckey\u2019s expertise in the realm of mixed reality, few observers share his optimism for the IVAS program. They view it, thus far, as an avalanche of failures.\nIVAS was first approved in 2018 as an effort to build state-of-the-art mixed-reality headsets for soldiers. In March 2021, Microsoft was awarded nearly $22 billion over 10 years to lead the project, but it quickly became mired in delays. Just a year later, a Pentagon audit criticized the program for not properly testing the goggles, saying its choices \"could result in wasting up to $21.88 billion in taxpayer funds to field a system that soldiers may not want to use or use as intended.\u201d The first two variants of the goggles\u2014of which the army purchased 10,000 units\u2014gave soldiers nausea, neck pain, and eye strain, according to internal documents obtained by Bloomberg.\nSuch reports have left IVAS on a short leash with members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which helps determine how much money should be spent on the program. In a subcommittee meeting in May, Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and ranking member, expressed frustration at IVAS\u2019s slow pace and high costs, and in July the committee suggested a $200 million cut to the program.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has for years been cutting investments into its HoloLens headset\u2014the hardware on which the IVAS program is based\u2014for lack of adoption. In June, Microsoft announced layoffs to its HoloLens teams, suggesting the project is now focused solely on serving the Department of Defense. The company received a serious blow in August, when reports revealed that the Army is considering reopening bidding for the contract to oust Microsoft entirely.\nThis is the catastrophe that Luckey\u2019s stepped into. Anduril\u2019s contribution to the project will be Lattice, an AI-powered system that connects everything from drones to radar jammers to surveil, detect objects, and aid in decision-making. Lattice is increasingly becoming Anduril\u2019s flagship offering. It\u2019s a tool that allows soldiers to receive instantaneous information not only from Anduril\u2019s hardware, but also from radars, vehicles, sensors, and other equipment not made by Anduril. Now it will be built into the IVAS goggles. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite a hive mind, but it\u2019s certainly a hive eye\u201d is how Luckey described it to me.\nBoosted by Lattice, the IVAS program aims to produce a headset that can help soldiers \u201crapidly identify potential threats and take decisive action\u201d on the battlefield, according to the Army. If designed well, the device will automatically sort through countless pieces of information\u2014drone locations, vehicles, intelligence\u2014and flag the most important ones to the wearer in real time.\nLuckey defends the IVAS program\u2019s bumps in the road as exactly what one should expect when developing mixed reality for defense. \u201cNone of these problems are anything that you would consider insurmountable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of if it\u2019s going to be this year or a few years from now.\u201d He adds that delaying a product is far better than releasing an inferior product, quoting Shigeru Miyamoto, the game director of Nintendo: \u201cA delayed game is delayed only once, but a bad game is bad forever.\u201d\nHe\u2019s increasingly convinced that the military, not consumers, will be the most important testing ground for mixed-reality hardware: \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an AR headset on every soldier, long before you see it on every civilian,\u201d he says. In the consumer world, any headset company is competing with the ubiquity and ease of the smartphone, but he sees entirely different trade-offs in defense.\n\u201cThe gains are so different when we talk about life-or-death scenarios. You don\u2019t have to worry about things like \u2018Oh, this is kind of dorky looking,\u2019 or \u2018Oh, you know, this is slightly heavier than I would prefer,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the alternatives of, you know, getting killed or failing your mission are a lot less desirable.\u201d\nThose in charge of the IVAS program remain steadfast in the expectation that it will pay off with huge gains for those on the battlefield. \u201cIf it works,\u201d James Rainey, commanding general of the Army Futures Command, told the Armed Services Committee in May, \u201cit is a legitimate 10x upgrade to our most important formations.\u201d That\u2019s a big \u201cif,\u201d and one that currently depends on Microsoft\u2019s ability to deliver. Luckey didn\u2019t get specific when I asked if Anduril was positioning itself to bid to become IVAS\u2019s primary contractor should the opportunity arise.\nIf that happens, US troops may, willingly or not, become the most important test subjects for augmented- and virtual-reality technology as it is developed in the coming decades. The commercial sector doesn\u2019t have thousands of individuals within a single institution who can test hardware in physically and mentally demanding situations and provide their feedback on how to improve it.\nThat\u2019s one of the ways selling to the defense sector is very different from selling to consumers, Luckey says: \u201cYou don\u2019t actually have to convince every single soldier that they personally want to use it. You need to convince the people in charge of him, his commanding officer, and the people in charge of him that this is a thing that is worth wearing.\u201d The iterations that eventually come from IVAS\u2014if it keeps its funding\u2014could signal what\u2019s coming next for the commercial market.\nWhen I asked Luckey if there were lessons from Oculus he had to unlearn when working with the Department of Defense, he said there\u2019s one: worrying about budgets. \u201cI prided myself for years, you know\u2014I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s figured out how to make VR accessible to the masses by being absolutely brutal at every part of the design process, trying to get costs down. That isn\u2019t what the DOD wants,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the cheapest headset in a vacuum. They want to save money, and generally, spending a bit more money on a headset that is more durable or that has better vision\u2014and therefore allows you to complete a mission faster\u2014is definitely worth the extra few hundred dollars.\u201d\nI asked if he\u2019s impressed by the progress that\u2019s been made during his eight-year hiatus from mixed reality. Since he left Facebook in 2017, Apple, Magic Leap, Meta, Snap, and a cascade of startups have been racing to move the technology from the fringe to the mainstream. Everything in mixed reality is about trade-offs, he says. Would you like more computing power, or a lighter and more comfortable headset?\nWith more time at Meta, \u201cI would have made different trade-offs in a way that I think would have led to greater adoption,\u201d he says. \u201cBut of course, everyone thinks that.\u201d While he\u2019s impressed with the gains, \u201chaving been on the inside, I also feel like things could be moving faster.\u201d\nYears after leaving, Luckey remains noticeably annoyed by one specific decision he thinks Meta got wrong: not offloading the battery. Dwelling on technical details is unsurprising from someone who spent his formative years living in a trailer in his parents\u2019 driveway posting in obscure forums and obsessing over goggle prototypes. He pontificated on the benefits of packing the heavy batteries and chips in removable pucks that the user could put in a pocket, rather than in the headset itself. Doing so makes the headset lighter and more comfortable. He says he was pushing Facebook to go that route before he was ousted, but when he left, it abandoned the idea. Apple chose to have an external battery for its Vision Pro, which Luckey praised.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m still sore about it eight years later.\u201d\nSpeaking of soreness, Luckey\u2019s most public professional wound, his ouster from Facebook in 2017, was partially healed last month. The story\u2014involving countless Twitter threads, doxxing, retractions and corrections to news articles, suppressed statements, and a significant segment in Blake Harris\u2019s 2020 book The History of the Future\u2014is difficult to boil down. But here\u2019s the short version: A donation by Luckey to a pro-Trump group called Nimble America in late 2016 led to turmoil within Facebook after it was reported by the Daily Beast. That turmoil grew, especially after Ars Technica wrote that his donation was funding racist memes (the founders of Nimble America were involved in the subreddit r/TheDonald, but the organization itself was focused on creating pro-Trump billboards). Luckey left in March 2017, but Meta has never disclosed why.\nThis April, Oculus\u2019s former CTO John Carmack posted on X that he regretted not supporting Luckey more. Meta\u2019s CTO, Andrew Bosworth, argued with Carmack, largely siding with Meta. In response, Luckey said, \u201cYou publicly told everyone my departure had nothing to do with politics, which is absolutely insane and obviously contradicted by reams of internal communications.\u201d The two argued. In the X argument, Bosworth cautioned that there are \u201climits on what can be said here,\u201d to which Luckey responded, \u201cI am down to throw it all out there. We can make everything public and let people judge for themselves. Just say the word.\u201d\nSix months later, Bosworth apologized to Luckey for the comments. Luckey responded, writing that although he is \u201cinfamously good at holding grudges,\u201d neither Bosworth nor current leadership at Meta was involved in the incident.\nBy now Luckey has spent years mulling over how much of his remaining anger is irrational or misplaced, but one thing is clear. He has a grudge left, but it\u2019s against people behind the scenes\u2014PR agents, lawyers, reporters\u2014who, from his perspective, created a situation that forced him to accept and react to an account he found totally flawed. He\u2019s angry about the steps Facebook took to keep him from communicating his side (Luckey has said he wrote versions of a statement at the time but that Facebook threatened further escalation if he posted it).\n\u201cWhat am I actually angry at? Am I angry that my life went in that direction? Absolutely,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI have a lot more anger for the people who lied in a way that ruined my entire life and that saw my own company ripped out from under me that I\u2019d spent my entire adult life building,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of anger left, but it\u2019s not at Meta, the corporate entity. It\u2019s not at Zuck. It\u2019s not at Boz. Those are not the people who wronged me.\u201d\nWhile various subcommittees within the Senate and House deliberate how many millions to spend on IVAS each year, what is not in question is the Pentagon is investing to prepare for a potential conflict in the Pacific between China and Taiwan. The Pentagon requested nearly $10 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative in its latest budget. The prospect of such a conflict is something Luckey considers often.\nHe told the authors of Unit X: How the Pentagon and Silicon Valley Are Transforming the Future of War that Anduril\u2019s \u201centire internal road map\u201d has been organized around the question \u201cHow do you deter China? Not just in Taiwan, but Taiwan and beyond?\u201d\nAt this point, nothing about IVAS is geared specifically toward use in the South Pacific as opposed to Ukraine or anywhere else. The design is in early stages. According to transcripts of a Senate Armed Services Subcommittee meeting in May, the military was scheduled to receive the third iteration of IVAS goggles earlier this summer. If they were on schedule, they\u2019re currently in testing. That version is likely to change dramatically before it approaches Luckey\u2019s vision for the future of mixed-reality warfare, in which \u201cyou have a little bit of an AI guardian angel on your shoulder, helping you out and doing all the stuff that is easy to miss in the midst of battle.\u201d\nBut will soldiers ever trust such a \u201cguardian angel\u201d? If the goggles of the future rely on AI-powered software like Lattice to identify threats\u2014say, an enemy drone ahead or an autonomous vehicle racing toward you\u2014Anduril is making the promise that it can sort through the false positives, recognize threats with impeccable accuracy, and surface critical information when it counts most.\nLuckey says the real test is how the technology compares with the current abilities of humans. \u201cIn a lot of cases, it\u2019s already better,\u201d he says, referring to Lattice, as measured by Anduril\u2019s internal tests (it has not released these, and they have not been assessed by any independent external experts). \u201cPeople are fallible in ways that machines aren\u2019t necessarily,\u201d he adds.\nStill, Luckey admits he does worry about the threats Lattice will miss.\n\u201cOne of the things that really worries me is there\u2019s going to be people who die because Lattice misunderstood something, or missed a threat to a soldier that it should have seen,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, I can recognize that it\u2019s still doing far better than people are doing today.\u201d\nWhen Lattice makes a significant mistake, it\u2019s unlikely the public will know. Asked about the balance between transparency and national security in disclosing these errors, Luckey said that Anduril\u2019s customer, the Pentagon, will receive complete information about what went wrong. That\u2019s in line with the Pentagon\u2019s policies on responsible AI adoption, which require that AI-driven systems be \u201cdeveloped with methodologies, data sources, design procedures, and documentation that are transparent to and auditable by their relevant defense personnel.\u201d\nHowever, the policies promise nothing about disclosure to the public, a fact that\u2019s led some progressive think tanks, like the Brennan Center for Justice, to call on federal agencies to modernize public transparency efforts for the age of AI.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, Well, shouldn\u2019t you be honest about this failure of your system to detect something?\u201d Luckey says, regarding Anduril\u2019s obligations. \u201cWell, what if the failure was because the Chinese figured out a hole in the system and leveraged that to speed past our defenses of some military base? I\u2019d say there\u2019s not very much public good served in saying, \u2018Attention, everyone\u2014there is a way to get past all of the security on every US military base around the world.\u2019 I would say that transparency would be the worst thing you could do.\u201d\nDeep Dive\nArtificial intelligence\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "The data center boom in the desert\nThe AI race is transforming northwestern Nevada into one of the world's largest data-center markets\u2014and sparking fears of water strains in the nation\u2019s driest state.\nIn the high desert east of Reno, Nevada, construction crews are flattening the golden foothills of the Virginia Range, laying the foundations of a data center city.\nGoogle, Tract, Switch, EdgeCore, Novva, Vantage, and PowerHouse are all operating, building, or expanding huge facilities within the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, a business park bigger than the city of Detroit.\nThis story is a part of MIT Technology Review\u2019s series \u201cPower Hungry: AI and our energy future,\u201d on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft acquired more than 225 acres of undeveloped property within the center and an even larger plot in nearby Silver Springs, Nevada. Apple is expanding its data center, located just across the Truckee River from the industrial park. OpenAI has said it\u2019s considering building a data center in Nevada as well.\nThe corporate race to amass computing resources to train and run artificial intelligence models and store information in the cloud has sparked a data center boom in the desert\u2014just far enough away from Nevada\u2019s communities to elude wide notice and, some fear, adequate scrutiny.\nThe full scale and potential environmental impacts of the developments aren\u2019t known, because the footprint, energy needs, and water requirements are often closely guarded corporate secrets. Most of the companies didn\u2019t respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review, or declined to provide additional information about the projects.\nBut there\u2019s \u201ca whole lot of construction going on,\u201d says Kris Thompson, who served as the longtime project manager for the industrial center before stepping down late last year. \u201cThe last number I heard was 13 million square feet under construction right now, which is massive.\u201d\nIndeed, it\u2019s the equivalent of almost five Empire State Buildings laid out flat. In addition, public filings from NV Energy, the state\u2019s near-monopoly utility, reveal that a dozen data-center projects, mostly in this area, have requested nearly six gigawatts of electricity capacity within the next decade.\nThat would make the greater Reno area\u2014the biggest little city in the world\u2014one of the largest data-center markets around the globe.\nIt would also require expanding the state\u2019s power sector by about 40%, all for a single industry in an explosive growth stage that may, or may not, prove sustainable. The energy needs, in turn, suggest those projects could consume billions of gallons of water per year, according to an analysis conducted for this story.\nThe build-out of a dense cluster of energy and water-hungry data centers in a small stretch of the nation\u2019s driest state, where climate change is driving up temperatures faster than anywhere else in the country, has begun to raise alarms among water experts, environmental groups, and residents. That includes members of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, whose namesake water body lies within their reservation and marks the end point of the Truckee River, the region\u2019s main source of water.\nMuch of Nevada has suffered through severe drought conditions for years, farmers and communities are drawing down many of the state\u2019s groundwater reservoirs faster than they can be refilled, and global warming is sucking more and more moisture out of the region\u2019s streams, shrubs, and soils.\n\u201cTelling entities that they can come in and stick more straws in the ground for data centers is raising a lot of questions about sound management,\u201d says Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, a nonprofit that works to protect water resources throughout Nevada and Utah.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t want to be in a situation where the tail is wagging the dog,\u201d he later added, \u201cwhere this demand for data centers is driving water policy.\u201d\nLuring data centers\nIn the late 1850s, the mountains southeast of Reno began enticing prospectors from across the country, who hoped to strike silver or gold in the famed Comstock Lode. But Storey County had few residents or economic prospects by the late 1990s, around the time when Don Roger Norman, a media-shy real estate speculator, spotted a new opportunity in the sagebrush-covered hills.\nHe began buying up tens of thousands of acres of land for tens of millions of dollars and lining up development approvals to lure industrial projects to what became the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. His partners included Lance Gilman, a cowboy-hat-wearing real estate broker, who later bought the nearby Mustang Ranch brothel and won a seat as a county commissioner.\nIn 1999, the county passed an ordinance that preapproves companies to develop most types of commercial and industrial projects across the business park, cutting months to years off the development process. That helped cinch deals with a flock of tenants looking to build big projects fast, including Walmart, Tesla, and Redwood Materials. Now the promise of fast permits is helping to draw data centers by the gigawatt.\nOn a clear, cool January afternoon, Brian Armon, a commercial real estate broker who leads the industrial practices group at NAI Alliance, takes me on a tour of the projects around the region, which mostly entails driving around the business center.\nAfter pulling off Interstate 80 onto USA Parkway, he points out the cranes, earthmovers, and riprap foundations, where a variety of data centers are under construction. Deeper into the industrial park, Armon pulls up near Switch\u2019s long, low, arched-roof facility, which sits on a terrace above cement walls and security gates. The Las Vegas\u2013based company says the first phase of its data center campus encompasses more than a million square feet, and that the full build-out will cover seven times that space.\nOver the next hill, we turn around in Google\u2019s parking lot. Cranes, tents, framing, and construction equipment extend behind the company\u2019s existing data center, filling much of the 1,210-acre lot that the search engine giant acquired in 2017.\nLast August, during an event at the University of Nevada, Reno, the company announced it would spend $400 million to expand the data center campus along with another one in Las Vegas.\nThompson says that the development company, Tahoe Reno Industrial LLC, has now sold off every parcel of developable land within the park (although several lots are available for resale following the failed gamble of one crypto tenant).\nWhen I ask Armon what\u2019s attracting all the data centers here, he starts with the fast approvals but cites a list of other lures as well: The inexpensive land. NV Energy\u2019s willingness to strike deals to supply relatively low-cost electricity. Cool nighttime and winter temperatures, as far as American deserts go, which reduce the energy and water needs. The proximity to tech hubs such as Silicon Valley, which cuts latency for applications in which milliseconds matter. And the lack of natural disasters that could shut down the facilities, at least for the most part.\n\u201cWe are high in seismic activity,\u201d he says. \u201cBut everything else is good. We\u2019re not going to have a tornado or flood or a devastating wildfire.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s the generous tax policies.\nNevada doesn\u2019t charge corporate income tax, and it has also enacted deep tax cuts specifically for data centers that set up shop in the state. That includes abatements of up to 75% on property tax for a decade or two\u2014and nearly as much of a bargain on the sales and use taxes applied to equipment purchased for the facilities.\nData centers don\u2019t require many permanent workers to run the operations, but the projects have created thousands of construction jobs. They\u2019re also helping to diversify the region\u2019s economy beyond casinos and generating tax windfalls for the state, counties, and cities, says Jeff Sutich, executive director of the Northern Nevada Development Authority. Indeed, just three data-center projects, developed by Apple, Google, and Vantage, will produce nearly half a billion dollars in tax revenue for Nevada, even with those generous abatements, according to the Nevada Governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development.\nThe question is whether the benefits of data centers are worth the tradeoffs for Nevadans, given the public health costs, greenhouse-gas emissions, energy demands, and water strains.\nThe rain shadow\nThe Sierra Nevada\u2019s granite peaks trace the eastern edge of California, forcing Pacific Ocean winds to rise and cool. That converts water vapor in the air into the rain and snow that fill the range\u2019s tributaries, rivers, and lakes.\nBut the same meteorological phenomenon casts a rain shadow over much of neighboring Nevada, forming an arid expanse known as the Great Basin Desert. The state receives about 10 inches of precipitation a year, about a third of the national average.\nThe Truckee River draws from the melting Sierra snowpack at the edge of Lake Tahoe, cascades down the range, and snakes through the flatlands of Reno and Sparks. It forks at the Derby Dam, a Reclamation Act project a few miles from the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, which diverts water to a farming region further east while allowing the rest to continue north toward Pyramid Lake.\nAlong the way, an engineered system of reservoirs, canals, and treatment plants divert, store, and release water from the river, supplying businesses, cities, towns, and native tribes across the region. But Nevada\u2019s population and economy are expanding, creating more demands on these resources even as they become more constrained.\nThroughout much of the 2020s the state has suffered through one of the hottest and most widespread droughts on record, extending two decades of abnormally dry conditions across the American West. Some scientists fear it may constitute an emerging megadrought.\nAbout 50% of Nevada currently faces moderate to exceptional drought conditions. In addition, more than half of the state\u2019s hundreds of groundwater basins are already \u201cover-appropriated,\u201d meaning the water rights on paper exceed the levels believed to be underground.\nIt\u2019s not clear if climate change will increase or decrease the state\u2019s rainfall levels, on balance. But precipitation patterns are expected to become more erratic, whiplashing between short periods of intense rainfall and more-frequent, extended, or severe droughts.\nIn addition, more precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow, shortening the Sierra snow season by weeks to months over the coming decades.\n\u201cIn the extreme case, at the end of the century, that\u2019s pretty much all of winter,\u201d says Sean McKenna, executive director of hydrologic sciences at the Desert Research Institute, a research division of the Nevada System of Higher Education.\nThat loss will undermine an essential function of the Sierra snowpack: reliably delivering water to farmers and cities when it\u2019s most needed in the spring and summer, across both Nevada and California.\nThese shifting conditions will require the region to develop better ways to store, preserve, and recycle the water it does get, McKenna says. Northern Nevada\u2019s cities, towns, and agencies will also need to carefully evaluate and plan for the collective impacts of continuing growth and development on the interconnected water system, particularly when it comes to water-hungry projects like data centers, he adds.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t consider each of these as a one-off, without considering that there may be tens or dozens of these in the next 15 years,\u201d McKenna says.\nThirsty data centers\nData centers suck up water in two main ways.\nAs giant rooms of server racks process information and consume energy, they generate heat that must be shunted away to prevent malfunctions and damage to the equipment. The processing units optimized for training and running AI models often draw more electricity and, in turn, produce more heat.\nTo keep things cool, more and more data centers have turned to liquid cooling systems that don\u2019t need as much electricity as fan cooling or air-conditioning.\nThese often rely on water to absorb heat and transfer it to outdoor cooling towers, where much of the moisture evaporates. Microsoft\u2019s US data centers, for instance, could have directly evaporated nearly 185,000 gallons of \u201cclean freshwater\u201d in the course of training OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 large language model, according to a 2023 preprint study led by researchers at the University of California, Riverside. (The research has since been peer-reviewed and is awaiting publication.)\nWhat\u2019s less appreciated, however, is that the larger data-center drain on water generally occurs indirectly, at the power plants generating extra electricity for the turbocharged AI sector. These facilities, in turn, require more water to cool down equipment, among other purposes.\nYou have to add up both uses \u201cto reflect the true water cost of data centers,\u201d says Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Riverside and coauthor of the study.\nRen estimates that the 12 data-center projects listed in NV Energy\u2019s report would directly consume between 860 million gallons and 5.7 billion gallons a year, based on the requested electricity capacity. (\u201cConsumed\u201d here means the water is evaporated, not merely withdrawn and returned to the engineered water system.) The indirect water drain associated with electricity generation for those operations could add up to 15.5 billion gallons, based on the average consumption of the regional grid.\nThe exact water figures would depend on shifting climate conditions, the type of cooling systems each data center uses, and the mix of power sources that supply the facilities.\nSolar power, which provides roughly a quarter of Nevada\u2019s power, requires relatively little water to operate, for instance. But natural-gas plants, which generate about 56%, withdraw 2,803 gallons per megawatt-hour on average, according to the Energy Information Administration.\nGeothermal plants, which produce about 10% of the state\u2019s electricity by cycling water through hot rocks, generally consume less water than fossil fuel plants do but often require more water than other renewables, according to some research.\nBut here too, the water usage varies depending on the type of geothermal plant in question. Google has lined up several deals to partially power its data centers through Fervo Energy, which has helped to commercialize an emerging approach that injects water under high pressure to fracture rock and form wells deep below the surface.\nThe company stresses that it doesn\u2019t evaporate water for cooling and that it relies on brackish groundwater, not fresh water, to develop and run its plants. In a recent post, Fervo noted that its facilities consume significantly less water per megawatt-hour than coal, nuclear, or natural-gas plants do.\nPart of NV Energy\u2019s proposed plan to meet growing electricity demands in Nevada includes developing several natural-gas peaking units, adding more than one gigawatt of solar power and installing another gigawatt of battery storage. It's also forging ahead with a more than $4 billion transmission project.\nBut the company didn\u2019t respond to questions concerning how it will supply all of the gigawatts of additional electricity requested by data centers, if the construction of those power plants will increase consumer rates, or how much water those facilities are expected to consume.\n\u201cNV Energy teams work diligently on our long-term planning to make investments in our infrastructure to serve new customers and the continued growth in the state without putting existing customers at risk,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nAn added challenge is that data centers need to run around the clock. That will often compel utilities to develop new electricity-generating sources that can run nonstop as well, as natural-gas, geothermal, or nuclear plants do, says Emily Grubert, an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at the University of Notre Dame, who has studied the relative water consumption of electricity sources.\n\u201cYou end up with the water-intensive resources looking more important,\u201d she adds.\nEven if NV Energy and the companies developing data centers do strive to power them through sources with relatively low water needs, \u201cwe only have so much ability to add six gigawatts to Nevada\u2019s grid,\u201d Grubert explains. \u201cWhat you do will never be system-neutral, because it\u2019s such a big number.\u201d\nSecuring supplies\nOn a mid-February morning, I meet TRI\u2019s Thompson and Don Gilman, Lance Gilman\u2019s son, at the Storey County offices, located within the industrial center.\n\u201cI\u2019m just a country boy who sells dirt,\u201d Gilman, also a real estate broker, says by way of introduction.\nWe climb into his large SUV and drive to a reservoir in the heart of the industrial park, filled nearly to the lip.\nThompson explains that much of the water comes from an on-site treatment facility that filters waste fluids from companies in the park. In addition, tens of millions of gallons of treated effluent will also likely flow into the tank this year from the Truckee Meadows Water Authority Reclamation Facility, near the border of Reno and Sparks. That\u2019s thanks to a 16-mile pipeline that the developers, the water authority, several tenants, and various local cities and agencies partnered to build, through a project that began in 2021.\n\u201cOur general improvement district is furnishing that water to tech companies here in the park as we speak,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThat helps preserve the precious groundwater, so that is an environmental feather in the cap for these data centers. They are focused on environmental excellence.\u201d\nBut data centers often need drinking-quality water\u2014not wastewater merely treated to irrigation standards\u2014for evaporative cooling, \u201cto avoid pipe clogs and/or bacterial growth,\u201d the UC Riverside study notes. For instance, Google says its data centers withdrew about 7.7 billion gallons of water in 2023, and nearly 6 billion of those gallons were potable.\nTenants in the industrial park can potentially obtain access to water from the ground and the Truckee River, as well. From early on, the master developers worked hard to secure permits to water sources, since they are nearly as precious as development entitlements to companies hoping to build projects in the desert.\nInitially, the development company controlled a private business, the TRI Water and Sewer Company, that provided those services to the business park\u2019s tenants, according to public documents. The company set up wells, a water tank, distribution lines, and a sewer disposal system.\nBut in 2000, the board of county commissioners established a general improvement district, a legal mechanism for providing municipal services in certain parts of the state, to manage electricity and then water within the center. It, in turn, hired TRI Water and Sewer as the operating company.\nAs of its 2020 service plan, the general improvement district held permits for nearly 5,300 acre-feet of groundwater, \u201cwhich can be pumped from well fields within the service area and used for new growth as it occurs.\u201d The document lists another 2,000 acre-feet per year available from the on-site treatment facility, 1,000 from the Truckee River, and 4,000 more from the effluent pipeline.\nThose figures haven\u2019t budged much since, according to Shari Whalen, general manager of the TRI General Improvement District. All told, they add up to more than 4 billion gallons of water per year for all the needs of the industrial park and the tenants there, data centers and otherwise.\nWhalen says that the amount and quality of water required for any given data center depends on its design, and that those matters are worked out on a case-by-case basis.\nWhen asked if the general improvement district is confident that it has adequate water resources to supply the needs of all the data centers under development, as well as other tenants at the industrial center, she says: \u201cThey can\u2019t just show up and build unless they have water resources designated for their projects. We wouldn\u2019t approve a project if it didn\u2019t have those water resources.\u201d\nWater battles\nAs the region\u2019s water sources have grown more constrained, lining up supplies has become an increasingly high-stakes and controversial business.\nMore than a century ago, the US federal government filed a lawsuit against an assortment of parties pulling water from the Truckee River. The suit would eventually establish that the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe\u2019s legal rights to water for irrigation superseded other claims. But the tribe has been fighting to protect those rights and increase flows from the river ever since, arguing that increasing strains on the watershed from upstream cities and businesses threaten to draw away water reserved for reservation farming, decrease lake levels, and harm native fish.\nThe Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe considers the water body and its fish, including the endangered cui-ui and threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout, to be essential parts of its culture, identity, and way of life. The tribe was originally named Cui-ui Ticutta, which translates to cui-ui eaters. The lake continues to provide sustenance as well as business for the tribe and its members, a number of whom operate boat charters and fishing guide services.\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely tied into us as a people,\u201d says Steven Wadsworth, chairman of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe.\n\u201cThat is what has sustained us all this time,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just who we are. It\u2019s part of our spiritual well-being.\u201d\nIn recent decades, the tribe has sued the Nevada State Engineer, Washoe County, the federal government, and others for overallocating water rights and endangering the lake\u2019s fish. It also protested the TRI General Improvement District\u2019s applications to draw thousands of additional acre\u2011feet of groundwater from a basin near the business park. In 2019, the State Engineer\u2019s office rejected those requests, concluding that the basin was already fully appropriated.\nMore recently, the tribe took issue with the plan to build the pipeline and divert effluent that would have flown into the Truckee, securing an agreement that required the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility and other parties to add back several thousand acre\u2011feet of water to the river.\nWhalen says she\u2019s sensitive to Wadsworth\u2019s concerns. But she says that the pipeline promises to keep a growing amount of treated wastewater out of the river, where it could otherwise contribute to rising salt levels in the lake.\n\u201cI think that the pipeline from [the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility] to our system is good for water quality in the river,\u201d she says. \u201cI understand philosophically the concerns about data centers, but the general improvement district is dedicated to working with everyone on the river for regional water-resource planning\u2014and the tribe is no exception.\u201d\nWater efficiency\nIn an email, Thompson added that he has \u201cgreat respect and admiration,\u201d for the tribe and has visited the reservation several times in an effort to help bring industrial or commercial development there.\nHe stressed that all of the business park\u2019s groundwater was \u201cvalidated by the State Water Engineer,\u201d and that the rights to surface water and effluent were purchased \u201cfor fair market value.\u201d\nDuring the earlier interview at the industrial center, he and Gilman had both expressed confidence that tenants in the park have adequate water supplies, and that the businesses won\u2019t draw water away from other areas.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in our own aquifer, our own water basin here,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cYou put a straw in the ground here, you\u2019re not going to pull water from Fernley or from Reno or from Silver Springs.\u201d\nGilman also stressed that data-center companies have gotten more water efficient in recent years, echoing a point others made as well.\n\u201cWith the newer technology, it\u2019s not much of a worry,\u201d says Sutich, of the Northern Nevada Development Authority. \u201cThe technology has come a long way in the last 10 years, which is really giving these guys the opportunity to be good stewards of water usage.\u201d\nIndeed, Google\u2019s existing Storey County facility is air-cooled, according to the company\u2019s latest environmental report. The data center withdrew 1.9 million gallons in 2023 but only consumed 200,000 gallons. The rest cycles back into the water system.\nGoogle said all the data centers under construction on its campus will also \u201cutilize air-cooling technology.\u201d The company didn\u2019t respond to a question about the scale of its planned expansion in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, and referred a question about indirect water consumption to NV Energy.\nThe search giant has stressed that it strives to be water efficient across all of its data centers, and decides whether to use air or liquid cooling based on local supply and projected demand, among other variables.\nFour years ago, the company set a goal of replenishing more water than it consumes by 2030. Locally, it also committed to provide half a million dollars to the National Forest Foundation to improve the Truckee River watershed and reduce wildfire risks.\nMicrosoft clearly suggested in earlier news reports that the Silver Springs land it purchased around the end of 2022 would be used for a data center. NAI Alliance\u2019s market real estate report identifies that lot, as well as the parcel Microsoft purchased within the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, as data center sites.\nBut the company now declines to specify what it intends to build in the region.\n\u201cWhile the land purchase is public knowledge, we have not disclosed specific details [of] our plans for the land or potential development timelines,\u201d wrote Donna Whitehead, a Microsoft spokesperson, in an email.\nMicrosoft has also scaled down its global data-center ambitions, backing away from several projects in recent months amid shifting economic conditions, according to various reports.\nWhatever it ultimately does or doesn\u2019t build, the company stresses that it has made strides to reduce water consumption in its facilities. Late last year, the company announced that it\u2019s using \u201cchip-level cooling solutions\u201d in data centers, which continually circulate water between the servers and chillers through a closed loop that the company claims doesn\u2019t lose any water to evaporation. It says the design requires only a \u201cnominal increase\u201d in energy compared to its data centers that rely on evaporative water cooling.\nOthers seem to be taking a similar approach. EdgeCore also said its 900,000-square-foot data center at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center will rely on an \u201cair-cooled closed-loop chiller\u201d that doesn\u2019t require water evaporation for cooling.\nBut some of the companies seem to have taken steps to ensure access to significant amounts of water. Switch, for instance, took a lead role in developing the effluent pipeline. In addition, Tract, which develops campuses on which third-party data centers can build their own facilities, has said it lined up more than 1,100 acre-feet of water rights, the equivalent of nearly 360 million gallons a year.\nApple, Novva, Switch, Tract, and Vantage didn\u2019t respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review.\nComing conflicts\nThe suggestion that companies aren\u2019t straining water supplies when they adopt air cooling is, in many cases, akin to saying they\u2019re not responsible for the greenhouse gas produced through their power use simply because it occurs outside of their facilities. In fact, the additional water used at a power plant to meet the increased electricity needs of air cooling may exceed any gains at the data center, Ren, of UC Riverside, says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually very likely, because it uses a lot more energy,\u201d he adds.\nThat means that some of the companies developing data centers in and around Storey County may simply hand off their water challenges to other parts of Nevada or neighboring states across the drying American West, depending on where and how the power is generated, Ren says.\nGoogle has said its air-cooled facilities require about 10% more electricity, and its environmental report notes that the Storey County facility is one of its two least-energy-efficient data centers.\nSome fear there\u2019s also a growing mismatch between what Nevada\u2019s water permits allow, what\u2019s actually in the ground, and what nature will provide as climate conditions shift. Notably, the groundwater committed to all parties from the Tracy Segment basin\u2014a long-fought-over resource that partially supplies the TRI General Improvement District\u2014already exceeds the \u201cperennial yield.\u201d That refers to the maximum amount that can be drawn out every year without depleting the reservoir over the long term.\n\u201cIf pumping does ultimately exceed the available supply, that means there will be conflict among users,\u201d Roerink, of the Great Basin Water Network, said in an email. \u201cSo I have to wonder: Who could be suing whom? Who could be buying out whom? How will the tribe\u2019s rights be defended?\u201d\nThe Truckee Meadows Water Authority, the community-owned utility that manages the water system for Reno and Sparks, said it is planning carefully for the future and remains confident there will be \u201csufficient resources for decades to come,\u201d at least within its service territory west of the industrial center.\nStorey County, the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, and the State Engineer\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to questions or accept interview requests.\nOpen for business\nAs data center proposals have begun shifting into Northern Nevada\u2019s cities, more local residents and organizations have begun to take notice and express concerns. The regional division of the Sierra Club, for instance, recently sought to overturn the approval of Reno\u2019s first data center, about 20 miles west of the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center.\nOlivia Tanager, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Toiyabe Chapter, says the environmental organization was shocked by the projected electricity demands from data centers highlighted in NV Energy\u2019s filings.\n\u201cWe have increasing interest in understanding the impact that data centers will have to our climate goals, to our grid as a whole, and certainly to our water resources,\u201d she says. \u201cThe demands are extraordinary, and we don\u2019t have that amount of water to toy around with.\u201d\nDuring a city hall hearing in January that stretched late into the evening, she and a line of residents raised concerns about the water, energy, climate, and employment impacts of AI data centers. At the end, though, the city council upheld the planning department\u2019s approval of the project, on a 5-2 vote.\n\u201cWelcome to Reno,\u201d Kathleen Taylor, Reno\u2019s vice mayor, said before casting her vote. \u201cWe\u2019re open for business.\u201d\nWhere the river ends\nIn late March, I walk alongside Chairman Wadsworth, of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, on the shores of Pyramid Lake, watching a row of fly-fishers in waders cast their lines into the cold waters.\nThe lake is the largest remnant of Lake Lahontan, an Ice Age inland sea that once stretched across western Nevada and would have submerged present-day Reno. But as the climate warmed, the lapping waters retreated, etching erosional terraces into the mountainsides and exposing tufa deposits around the lake, large formations of porous rock made of calcium-carbonate. That includes the pyramid-shaped island on the eastern shore that inspired the lake\u2019s name.\nIn the decades after the US Reclamation Service completed the Derby Dam in 1905, Pyramid Lake declined another 80 feet and nearby Winnemucca Lake dried up entirely.\n\u201cWe know what happens when water use goes unchecked,\u201d says Wadsworth, gesturing eastward toward the range across the lake, where Winnemucca once filled the next basin over. \u201cBecause all we have to do is look over there and see a dry, barren lake bed that used to be full.\u201d\nIn an earlier interview, Wadsworth acknowledged that the world needs data centers. But he argued they should be spread out across the country, not densely clustered in the middle of the Nevada desert.\nGiven the fierce competition for resources up to now, he can\u2019t imagine how there could be enough water to meet the demands of data centers, expanding cities, and other growing businesses without straining the limited local supplies that should, by his accounting, flow to Pyramid Lake.\nHe fears these growing pressures will force the tribe to wage new legal battles to protect their rights and preserve the lake, extending what he refers to as \u201ca century of water wars.\u201d\n\u201cWe have seen the devastating effects of what happens when you mess with Mother Nature,\u201d Wadsworth says. \u201cPart of our spirit has left us. And that\u2019s why we fight so hard to hold on to what\u2019s left.\u201d\nCorrection: This story was updated to clarify that the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility isn\u2019t operated by the Truckee Meadows Water Authority.\nDeep Dive\nClimate change and energy\nGoogle\u2019s electricity demand is skyrocketing\nThe tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power.

      "text": "In a moonshot move, AI search engine Perplexity has offered to buy Chrome from Google for $34.5 billion cash in an unsolicited offer, Reuters reported, and Perplexity has confirmed to TechCrunch.\nPerplexity tells TC the terms of the offer include a commitment to keep Chrome\u2019s underlying engine, Chromium, open source and continue to invest in it. Perplexity\u2019s offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.\nPerplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default.\nGoogle could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.\nThis bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling.\nThe Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)\nWhen the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare according to Statcounter, if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Should Perplexity\u2019s offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain.\nStill, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup\u2019s current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, Bloomberg reported.\nIn the meantime, Perplexity last month launched its own browser, called Comet, in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.\nAnd, by the way, last month, Perplexity also reportedly submitted a bid to merge with TikTok."
