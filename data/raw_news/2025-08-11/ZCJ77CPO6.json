  "title": "Rapper Fekky goes from south London to farming",
  "description": "Fekky, who has collaborated with some of the big names in rap, began his journey in lockdown.",
  "content": "Rapper Fekky has said he has found \"peace\" after moving from south London to a farm in the countryside.\n\nThe musician, who has collaborated with artists including Skepta and Dizzee Rascal, began his journey after he started gardening in the Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nHe moved from Lewisham to a farm in Cambridgeshire a few years ago - where he has chickens and vegetable patches - and said \"there's so much more that I want to do but I feel like the learning process is key\".\n\nFekky is documenting his journey through a YouTube show, Hood 2 Farm, where he meets other farmers.\n\nThe 38-year-old has released seven albums, as well as singles and EPs, and his collaboration with singer-songwriter Runtown for the track Unleash has nearly 11 million streams on Spotify.\n\nHe fell in love with nature while in Thailand for three months, before gardening during lockdown and posting it on his social media.\n\n\"Everyone was calling it the garden show and whatnot so I had a bit of a following through it,\" he said.\n\n\"And I was like, 'Do you know what? I want to live in nature full-time'.\"\n\nFekky said he felt \"like people can see my passion, they can see that I'm genuine\".\n\nHis show draws inevitable comparisons to the Amazon Prime hit programme Clarkson's Farm, which documents TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson's quest in farming.\n\n\"I'm inspired by Clarkson's Farm,\" he said. \"I think this is where I want to get to. I'm on seven acres. He's on like thousands or something.\"\n\nFekky said he wanted to learn farming in the UK and abroad, with hopes for a farm shop, glamping and a pub.\n\n\"Hopefully within the next few years, it'll be Fekky's Farm. Clarkson's got to get out of the way for a minute and give me a go,\" he joked.\n\nHe hopes his move inspires others from a similar background to think about different career paths.\n\n\"I feel like when you grow up in areas like mine, you're under a lot of peer pressure to follow the crowd. People think, 'Oh, be a footballer or be a rapper or whatnot'.\n\n\"These are like the cliche ways to get out and I want the youth to learn before I did.\n\n\"I got into a lot of trouble when I was younger. It took me a long time to get to this place where I am now, where I'm living in peace and enjoying myself.\n\n\"I'm hoping that people are watching me and thinking 'If Fekky's doing it and he's like the hardcore rapper and now's on a farm, I can do it'.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the National Farmers' Union said: \"With the average age of a farmer in the UK at 59, we need to bring younger people from a diverse range of backgrounds to give farming a positive future.\n\n\"We are positioned better than any other industry to really be at the forefront of the climate emergency action that's happening, in terms of reducing carbon emissions with things like sequestering carbon.\n\n\"To achieve these things, we need a younger generation of people coming through who have a massive passion for this.\"\n\nMore on this story\n\u2022 None 'You are on your own - but I still love farming'",

      "text": "'You are on your own - but I still love farming'\n- Published\nFarming can be rewarding but is not without its challenges, according to one south west agriculture student.\nDairy farm worker Terri Taylor said: \"It's a lot of long hours and hard work. You're on your own most of the time - you really have to love it.\"\nMs Taylor, from Devon, and Abi Radford, from Liskeard in Cornwall, are both studying agriculture at Cornwall College but their journeys into the field could not be more different.\nMs Taylor was raised in a farming family while Ms Radford is a self-confessed \"townie\" who stumbled into farming after she was offered a job on a smallholding.\nMs Radford said she was offered a job on a smallholding a few years ago.\n\"I thought it sounded fun, so I gave it a go,\" she explained.\n\"I really enjoyed it and decided to pursue a career in farming. I didn't know much at the time, so I enrolled in college to learn more.\"\nFarming is gaining popularity among young people, thanks in part to more positive portrayals in the media and increased awareness in schools, said Alex Hollands, farms director at Cornwall College.\n\"Schools are starting to talk about it as a real career path,\" he said.\n\"When I first said I wanted to be a farmer, people thought I was crazy.\n\"There are so many different roles, you don't have to be out in the field getting wet.\"\nMs Taylor points out that while farming can be rewarding, it is not without its challenges.\n\"It's a lot of long hours and hard work. People think tractor driving is easy, but it can be lonely.\n\"In farming you're on your own a lot of the time. It's a very lonely enterprise to be in \"You really have to love it.\"\nDespite the demands, both students are enthusiastic about their futures.\nMs Radford is particularly drawn to livestock and currently works two days a week on a dairy farm.\nShe also enjoys the balance of practical and theoretical learning.\n\"I didn't realise how much there was to it until I started studying. I love it,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X, external, Facebook, external and Instagram, external. Follow BBC Devon on X, external, Facebook, external and Instagram, external.
