  "description": "Root shows no sign of slowing down with 22 hundreds in his last 61 Tests.",
  "content": "England batter Joe Root\u2019s insatiable appetite for runs has left even his fellow \u2018Fab Four\u2019 member Kane Williamson in awe.\n\nThe pair, plus Australia\u2019s Steve Smith and India\u2019s Virat Kohli, have lived up to their billing after being banded together and touted as future greats by former New Zealand batter Martin Crowe in 2014.\n\nRoot shows no sign of slowing down with 22 hundreds in his last 61 Tests and he recently moved up to second on the list of all-time top run-scorers in the format, now sitting 2,378 behind India\u2019s Sachin Tendulkar.\n\nThe 34-year-old\u2019s prolonged purple patch has so impressed Williamson \u2013 the former New Zealand captain \u2013 who is no doubt his contemporary seems like he could keep going for a lot longer.\n\nWilliamson, who turned 35 on Friday, said: \u201cJoe\u2019s just remarkable with what he\u2019s doing and where he\u2019s going and the things he\u2019s ticking off, at the moment. It\u2019s incredibly special and great to follow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just full of admiration for that. He\u2019s a little bit younger than me, which is even scarier, he could keep going and it feels like he could well do for about 20 years!\u201d\n\nWhile Williamson, Root and Smith continue their Test careers, Kohli, the eldest of the quartet, called time on his career in the longest format earlier this year.\n\nWilliamson said: \u201cYou never really consider it and you do see some of your opponents and mates making some of these decisions and you think \u2018gosh, it has been a while\u2019, and you\u2019re not getting younger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reality at some stage. For someone like Virat, who made that decision to go out on his own terms and do what he\u2019s done for the game, that\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s so special.\n\n\u201cEveryone was caught by surprise because you feel like it will never happen, but it does. I\u2019m more aware of that than most \u2013 and that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWilliamson, with New Zealand\u2019s blessing after electing against signing a central contract, has skipped the Black Caps\u2019 ongoing Test series in Zimbabwe to play county cricket and The Hundred this summer.\n\nAs well as a stint with Middlesex, he is captaining London Spirit, again joining forces with former Australia batter David Warner, an ex-international foe and team-mate at several franchise leagues.\n\nWilliamson added: \u201cHe\u2019s without doubt been one of the greatest in the franchise T20 game. The heights he reached in the Indian Premier League, he\u2019s so highly-regarded, he\u2019s been one of the all-time greats.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a little bit further down the line in terms of his career but he still has that quality in him and it\u2019s great to have him in our team.\u201d",
