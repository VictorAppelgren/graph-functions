  "description": "There's a new push to change state laws regarding competency in criminal cases. One group has started a petition that calls on the state's district attorneys to urge the governor to call an emergency special session to amend or repeal those laws.",
  "content": "There's a new push to change state laws regarding competency in criminal cases. The Colorado Parents Advocacy Network has started a new petition that calls on the state's district attorneys to urge the governor to call an emergency special session to amend or repeal those laws.\n\nThis comes after charges were dropped in a number of cases, some involving murder and kidnapping, due to offenders being deemed incompetent to stand trial. Right now, state law requires a judge to dismiss charges against suspects who are found both incompetent and not restorable. That is what happened in the case of Solomon Galligan in Arapahoe County. He was facing kidnapping and child abuse charges after he was caught on camera lunging at elementary school children in Aurora during recess last April. But, after failing multiple state competency exams, those charges were dropped, and he's now in a state hospital.\n\nWorried that more suspects like Galligan will be released into communities, advocates with CPAN, Safe2Tell, victims' families, and lawmakers gathered at the Colorado Supreme Court on Tuesday to encourage citizens to sign the online petition.\n\n\"Our communities are not safe,\" said Lori Gimelshteyn, executive director of CPAN. \"This is our state, and we can ask and we can urge all these district attorneys, the ministers of justice here in the state, to do their duty and stand up for justice. We think it's very important for people in the community to understand that while [offenders] might have a civil commitment to a mental health institution, a psychiatric institution, on average, they are being released within 90 days.\"\n\nMental health advocates say safer communities are also created by providing effective care to those with behavioral health disorders, including those in the criminal justice system.\n\nYet victims' family members, like Brittany Visage, whose mother was killed in Monument last year, believe current laws do more to protect offenders and not victims. She said the man who admitted to killing her mom, Joel Lang, had his murder charges dismissed and is now back in the community because he was deemed incompetent to stand trial.\n\n\"Help me understand how our laws regarding competency can allow for someone who says, and I quote, 'I knew I hit her. I knew I was dragging her. I knew it would kill her. I just had to get out of there,'\" said Visage. \"[Lang] is free to walk our streets and drive on the same roads as you and I.\"\n\nIt's a frustration that Arapahoe County District Attorney Amy Padden said she understands and agrees that there needs to be change. In a one-on-one interview with CBS Colorado following Galligan's case being dismissed last month, Padden said there needs to be legislative change to hold people accountable.\n\n\"It is frustrating that our hands are tied by the way the state law is,\" Padden said. \"We are ethically obligated to follow state law. We're continuing to review the case to see if there's a basis for objection, but if there is no basis for objection, we won't have any choice. The case will be dismissed by the court.\"\n\nBut Gimelshteyn says that sentiments like \"it's the law\" are just excuses, adding that the state's 23 district attorneys can and should do more.\n\n\"The district attorneys are on the frontlines. They're the ones that have to look the Kerst family in their eyes and tell them there's nothing they can do,\" she said, explaining why the petition is directed to Colorado DAs. \"Quite honestly, we do know that people deserve compassion when dealing with mental health, but not at the sake of justice.\"\n\nCPAN launched its petition overnight on Monday and said more than 1,000 signatures have already been collected.",

(KKTV) - Murder charges have been dismissed for a man accused of a deadly hit and run that killed a mother out of Monument.\nThe 4th Judicial District Attorney\u2019s Office said on Friday that the case against Joel Lang was dismissed after the court found him incompetent to continue through trial, and that \u201chis competency could not be restored.\u201d\nIn November of 2024, Lang was charged with the murder of 47-year-old Kristy Kerst in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant in Monument.\nOn November 4, 2024, police said they responded to a hit-and-run at a McDonald\u2019s in Monument, where they found Kerst in the parking lot.

      "text": "Colorado families, community advocates rally for legislative change amid plans to dismiss kidnapping case\nFrustrated community leaders, lawmakers and families voiced their concerns with state legislation and mental health resources in the wake of the 18th Judicial District Attorney's Office's plans to dismiss charges against the man accused of attempting to kidnap a child on a school playground.\n\"It still haunts me,\" said Charles Morales.\nMorales was among a crowd of people who showed out to Wednesday's press conference outside the Arapahoe County Justice Center.\n\"I have a granddaughter who is still at Cherry Creek Schools, and I just don't want this to happen again,\" he said.\nHis reasoning is also personal, because he says he saw 34-year-old Solomon Galligan just before the suspect allegedly walked onto the playground at Black Forest Hills Elementary last year.\n\"I parked the car, watched him for a few minutes. He wasn't doing anything except walking up the sidewalk,\" said Morales. \"To this day, I kick myself, because I turned around and I let him go.\"\nLike other people in the community, Morales wants to know why Galligan's charges will be dropped, despite a history of repeated violent offenses.\n\"It was very frustrating at first, right?\" said Dante White. \"The initial kind of [feeling] was anger\u2026and [I] thought that they dropped the ball here.\"\nWhite's son was one of the children who saw Galligan approach them on the playground that day. Now, White is having to explain to him that the same man will not remain behind bars.\n\"He was confused, he said, 'Why is this person being let go? What exactly is occurring here to make this happen?'\" said White.\nWhite met with the district attorney's office hours before the news conference. During his meeting, White says they explained to him that their hands are tied amid new legislation that requires a case to be dismissed if a person is found incompetent to stand trial.\n\"The legislation has now codified this dangerous practice that allows violent offenders to have their charges dismissed and removed from the criminal justice system,\" said Lori Gimelshteyn, founder of the Colorado Parent Advocacy Network.\nWhite says this is a systemic issue that needs to be changed by working with lawmakers to re-examine the existing law or push for more mental health funding to prevent people like Galligan from slipping through the cracks.\n\"How do we work together to make sure an incident like this doesn't happen in the future?\" he said.\nThe 18th Judicial District Attorney Amy Padden released this statement to CBS Colorado: We are aware of several inaccuracies made by an Aurora councilwoman regarding the charges that are pending against Solomon Galligan, a defendant who was arrested in 2024 for an incident at Black Forest Hills Elementary School. In the interest of transparency and public accountability, we feel it is important to set the record straight. First and foremost, contrary to misleading public statements by the councilwoman, we have neither dropped nor moved to dismiss these charges, which include a class five-felony and a misdemeanor charge, as filed by the prior administration, arising out of an attempted kidnapping of an elementary school. To-date, all of the initially filed charges remain pending. The defendant's attorney filed a Motion to Dismiss earlier this month following an updated competency determination that was requested by the defense. Our Office has until July 28, 2025, to submit a formal response, after which a judge will decide the next steps. This defendant has had prior criminal cases in which their mental competency to proceed had been raised. Regarding the pending criminal case in Arapahoe County, the defendant's attorneys raised competency last year and the defendant underwent his first court-ordered mental competency evaluation in 2024\u2014prior to my taking office\u2014which was conducted by the state Office of Civil and Forensic Mental Health. The defendant's legal counsel requested that that report be supplemented, which the Court granted, and then the Court ordered another re-evaluation by the state. The defendant's counsel (not our office) then requested, and the Court ordered, a second evaluation by an independent psychiatrist, which was completed in June 2025. That comprehensive, 63-page report by a licensed doctor concluded that Galligan suffers from multiple mental health conditions and is mentally incompetent to stand trial and not restorable to competency within the foreseeable future. The District Court is tasked with making the ultimate decision as to whether the charges may proceed based on those findings under current Colorado law. If the Court decides that the defendant is incompetent and unlikely to be restored or to maintain competency during the pendency of the case, the Court is required by statute to dismiss the charges, and our Office is legally prohibited from taking this case to trial. As the District Attorney, I have many concerns about this statutory process and its impact on community safety in situations where charges must be dismissed. Even before the defense's motion to dismiss was filed in this case, I was speaking with legislators about proposed reforms to the statute. I will continue those discussions to collaborate about a solution that promotes community safety. If the motion to dismiss is granted here, Galligan will not be released into the community at that time. Although they were previously released when courts in other jurisdictions dismissed prior cases, this defendant has been civilly committed for continued treatment in a state mental health hospital, which provides secure, inpatient psychiatric care. Mental health is a critical issue in our criminal justice system, and I am committed to working with law enforcement, lawmakers, and community stakeholders to find lasting solutions. Unfortunately, some elected officials have chosen to politicize this issue rather than collaborating to work on productive solutions, such as changing the state laws that prosecutors and courts are required to follow. I want to be clear: politics plays no role in our pursuit of justice. We remain guided by the law, the facts, and our commitment to the people of Arapahoe County. Our Office will continue to provide accurate, timely information as appropriate. I took an oath to serve this community with honor, humility, and integrity\u2014and I will continue to uphold that commitment every day.\""

      "text": "District attorney pushes for change amid attempted kidnapping case in Aurora\nCommunity members in Aurora are voicing concerns over a controversial case involving a suspect accused of trying to kidnap a child at school. Now, 18th Judicial District Attorney Amy Padden is speaking out for the first time about the case and the possibility that it may be dismissed.\n\"My goal here is to try to get some legislative changes to make sure this never happens again,\" said Padden.\nLast April, a suspect was caught on video chasing and trying to grab a child on a school playground. Police later arrested 34-year-old Solomon Galligan for allegedly attempting to kidnap a child.\nThe suspect had a history of charges dating back to 2012, some of which were considered violent offenses. Case after case, he was deemed mentally incompetent. He'd also previously failed to register as a sex offender.\nThe district attorney's office reports that it has received approximately 1,400 calls and emails from families and community members regarding this case.\n\"As a community member, I'm very concerned. That video is concerning,\" said Padden.\nPadden, however, says her hands are tied, and as CBS Colorado has previously reported, the court is poised to dismiss Galligan's charges in this latest case.\n\"It is frustrating that our hands are tied by the way the state law is,\" said Padden.\nIn a one-on-one interview with CBS Colorado, Padden says Galligan went through four separate mental incompetency evaluations between July 2024 and April 2025.\nIn all but one, Galligan was deemed mentally incompetent to stand trial and could not be restored to competency.\nIn a fourth evaluation, the suspect was found competent to stand trial, but would lose competency over the course of a trial.\n\"If someone is in that mental state, they should not be released, in my view, under any circumstance,\" said Padden.\nHowever, Padden says the law limits that kind of discretion.\nPreviously, state law said the court \"may\" dismiss charges in a case where someone is found mentally incompetent to stand trial. Now, the latest statute that went into effect last year says the court \"shall\" dismiss the case.\n\"We are ethically obligated to follow state law. We're continuing to review the case to see if there's a basis for objection, but if there is no basis for objection, we won't have any choice. The case will be dismissed by the court,\" said Padden.\nIn this case, Galligan's prior cases helped the prosecution get a civil commitment order, so that Galligan is not released into the public after this case is dismissed.\nInstead, the suspect, currently being housed at the state mental hospital in Fort Logan, will be moved from the forensic ward to the civil commitment ward. There will be a review every 90 days to determine if Galligan is no longer a threat to themselves or to the public, which means there is no time limit as to when the suspect could be released.\n\"The intent is not to hold someone indefinitely, the intent is to hold someone and get them treatment,\" said Padden.\nHowever, Padden says this is just one in a number of cases in the state where mental incompetency comes into play, and she says there is concern that others will continue to slip through the cracks of the system.\n\"It's my understanding the legislature had anticipated there would be additional civil commitment resources available, but those resources haven't materialized,\" said Padden.\nHer goal moving forward is to try and work with lawmakers to find a way that prioritizes addressing mental health before someone commits an offense, or fund more beds to treat these individuals if and when cases must be dismissed.\n\"I would like to see some changes to the state statute,\" said Padden. \"We either need resources available or we need more discretion in the court to be sure that people who have severe mental illness and have committed a crime aren't just getting released with no consequences,\" said Padden."
