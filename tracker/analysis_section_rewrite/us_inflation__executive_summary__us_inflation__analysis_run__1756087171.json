      "feedback": "The draft is rich but sprawling and far from a 4–6 sentence executive brief; tighten to a single, crisp house view with a clear causal chain and actionable 0–6 month watch-list, and ensure every assertion is anchored to the cited source IDs. Reconcile regime naming (I/II/III vs A/B/C) into one consistent framework, map transitions to explicit triggers (inflation near 2%, fading tariff pass-through, Powell easing bias) and tie the timing to Jackson Hole signals, then open with a one-line verdict (base-case path and probability) before detailing catalysts, risks, and watch items. Build a tight first-principles narrative: policy easing lowers discount rates, lifts crypto PV, and regulatory catalysts expand institutional access; fuse this with a concise cross-asset read (Ford as macro proxy, crypto/AI linkage) without overloading the page with long-run macro scaffolding. Ensure numbers are sourced and precise (ETH 4,955; BTC 124,496; Brent mid-60s; ETH/BTC ETF/treasury inflows; 80–85% Sep-cut odds) and only appear with their SOURCE IDs; remove extraneous cross-currency/timeline material or clearly segregate it, so the piece stays decision-useful and devoid of platitudes. Finally, deliver a 4–6 sentence core brief plus a 4–6 item watch-list (data triggers, invalidation conditions, and explicit probabilities) with a single coherent set of catalysts (ETH ETFs/treasury flows, Project Crypto/SEC actions, Nvidia AI results, Jackson Hole tone) and a single, explicit risk paragraph.",
