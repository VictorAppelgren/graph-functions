  "content": "Can President Donald Trump legally send National Guard troops into Washington and seize control of the district\u2019s police force? The short answers are yes and yes.\n\nTrump has authority over the DC National Guard. It\u2019s the sole guard unit that reports only to the president.\n\nSection 740 of Washington\u2019s Home Rule Act gives presidents the authority to take control of the city\u2019s police department for up to 30 days during emergencies. Congressional approval is not needed.\n\nTrump has used the National Guard before, and so have other presidents. Deployments have been used to enforce civil rights, quell urban violence, and, once, even to fill in for striking postal workers.\n\nWhich presidents have used the National Guard \u2013 and why\n\nSix presidents \u2013 four Republicans and two Democrats \u2013 have activated the National Guard 11 times since 1957. Here's a breakdown of when presidential orders were made, the number of troops deployed, and whether the presidents had approval from the local governors or mayors:\n\nCan't see our graphics? Click here to reload page.\n\nWhat is the National Guard?\n\nThe National Guard, a military force with about 430,000 members, serves under state and federal authorities, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. It serves with regular military personnel overseas.\n\nNational Guard troops have also assisted in other missions, including:\n\nTrump announced his latest moves on Aug. 11 as part of a federal crackdown on crime, despite police statistics that indicate a decline in crime in the capital.\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move \"unsettling and unprecedented.\" Democrats criticized the action as a \u201cpower grab.\u201d\n\nThe president can't take over the DC government, according to Politico. Congress would first have to amend the Home Rule Act.\n\nNOTE President Kennedy authorized, but did not deploy, National Guard troops to desegregate public schools in Alabama in September 1963.",

      "text": "Trump orders National Guard into Washington and takes over DC police\nPresident Donald Trump said the federal government will take control of the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department.\n- Trump declared a public safety emergency in Washington, DC, and said the federal government will take over the local police department.\n- The president said he will deploy National Guard troops to fight crime in the capital.\n- Violent crime has fallen 26% in Washington, DC, from the same period last year, according the Metropolitan Police Department.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said he will deploy National Guard troops to Washington, DC, as part of an aggressive federal effort to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump said the federal government would also seize control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department.\n\"We're taking our capital back,\" Trump said August 11. \"We're taking it back.\"\n\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" Trump said. \"This is Liberation Day in DC, and we're going to take our capital back.\"\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser called the moves \"unsettling and unprecedented.\"\nTrump's actions follow a high-profile assault on a former staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), 19-year-old Edward Coristine, that occured in the early morning hours of Aug. 3. during an attempted carjacking.\nDC mayor: Trump\u2019s police takeover \u201cunsettling and unprecedented\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s move to assert control over Washington D.C.\u2019s police force is \"unsettling and unprecedented\" the city\u2019s mayor said, while also indicating she will cooperate with federal authorities.\nMayor Muriel Bowser disputed Trump\u2019s justification for declaring a crime emergency in D.C, calling it a subjective \u201cso-called emergency\u201d and noting that the crime has been trending down in the city after spiking in 2023.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not experiencing a spike in crime but a decrease in crime,\u201d Bowser said during an Aug. 11 press conference following Trump\u2019s announcement earlier in the day.\nYet she acknowledged Trump\u2019s authority under the Home Rule Act, which gives the federal government certain powers over D.C. governance. Trump cited the law in an executive order declaring he was using emergency powers to seize control of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cThe Home Rule charter requires the mayor to provide the services of MPD during special conditions of an emergency, and we will follow the law,\u201d Bowser.\n-Zac Anderson\nDOJ earlier said DC violent crime was at a 30-year low\nDespite claims of rising crime and violence in Washington by President Trump and his attorney general and FBI chief, the Justice Department itself announced in January that total violent crime for 2024 was down 35% from the year before.\nIn fact, crime in the capital \u201cis the lowest it has been in over 30 years,\u201d according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department included in a Jan. 3 statement by the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThen-U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, credited the declines to a \"focus on the drivers of violence \u2212 those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed.\u201d\nDuring an August 11 press conference, DC was described as one of the most unsafe and violent cities in the world by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Graves\u2019 recently confirmed replacement, former television personality Jeanine Pirro.\nBut the Justice Department in January said that in addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides were down 32%; robberies were down 39%; armed carjackings were down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon were down 27% when compared with 2023 levels. DOJ also said the District was reporting \u201cthe fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\u201d\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says on police response to protesters: \u2018You spit and we hit\u2019\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: \u201cYou spit and we hit.\u201d\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\u201cThey're not going to be fighting back long,\u201d Trump said,\nApparently recalling previous street protests where officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\u201cThey love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face. And I said you tell them, \u2018You spit and we hit,'\" Trump said. \u201cAnd they can hit real hard. It's a disgusting thing.\"\n\u2212Sudiksha Kochi\n\u2018Political theater,\u2019 says top Democrat\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sharply criticized President Trump\u2019s takeover of the Washington D.C. police department as \u201cpolitical theater,\u201d and said the nation\u2019s capital doesn\u2019t need it because it\u2019s already reducing violent crime.\n\"What the president did this morning was political theater,\u201d said Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cHis idea of federalizing the police force of D.C. ignores the reality,\u201d Durbin said at a news conference to discuss the Texas state House Democrats who are boycotting a Trump-backed push to redraw congressional districts.\n\u201cThey are making dramatic progress in reducing violent crime in D.C., so it's a typical move by this president to create chaos and uncertainty, and to draw the attention from other issues like Jeffrey Epstein,\" added Durbin, a longtime Democratic leader who that he will retire and not seek reelection in 2026.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says he's looking at downgrading marijuana\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said during his Aug. 11 press conference.\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\n-Sarah Wire\nTrump longs for completed White House ballroom\nPresident Trump brought up his plans to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House to the overflowing room of journalists packed into his Aug. 11 media briefing.\n\u201cI would've certainly loved to have had it today,\" the president said of the construction project that isn't slated to be completed until 2029. \"We would've filled it up.\"\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nHegseth to 'work with state governors' to use more National Guard troops\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is authorized to \"work with state governors\" to use their states' National Guard troops \"if necessary\" to deploy Washington, D.C., according to Will Scharf, an aide to President Donald Trump.\nHegseth got the green light in the presidential memo that Trump signed directing National Guard troops into Washington, Scharf said. For National Guard troops from states other than the District of Columbia to carry out law enforcement actions, they must be deployed with the consent of their states' governor. - Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTrump signs executive orders driving DC crackdown\nTrump signed two executive orders earlier in the day as part of his federal crackdown on Washington crime, White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said.\nOne order invoked Section 40 of the Home Rule Act to allow the Trump administration to take control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department\nSeparately, Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington. He said the memorandum also authorized Hegseth to work with governors of other states to utilize their National Guards as well.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump: 800 D.C. National Guard troops will be mobilized\nPresident Donald Trump said 800 troops from the Washington, D.C., National Guard will be mobilized. He said more could be tapped to join them.\n\"If necessary we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" he said.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTroops will be 'flowing into the streets of Washington'\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Washington, D.C., National Guard was mobilized the morning of August 11 at President Trump's direction.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Hegseth said. Hegseth said other National Guard units and \"specialized units\" stood ready.\n\"They will be strong. They will be tough,\" he said.\n\"We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure this city is safe, this city is beautiful.\"\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n'It\u2019s embarrassing,' Trump says of DC crime before Putin summit\nAs he announced the federal takeover of Washington, D.C., police, Trump said he didn\u2019t want to be talking the subject days before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cThis is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm gonna see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capitol was with graffiti all over the walls.\u201d\nThe leaders are scheduled to meet on Aug. 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the three-year Russian war on Ukraine, in the first in-person meeting since Trump took office for his second term.\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nTrump puts new DEA chief in charge of DC police\nTrump announced that Drug Enforcement Administrator Terrance Cole will take over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, okay?\u201d Trump told Cole, standing on the stage with him. \u201cAnd you run them tough, they're good. You have a lot of good people.\u201d\nCole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23, following his Senate confirmation.\n-Josh Meyer\nTrump declares public safety emergency, says Bondi will take command of DC police\nTrump said he is declaring a public safety emergency in Washington D.C. and announced Attorney General Pam Bondi will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department.\nTrump said his new DEA administrator Terry Cole will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\nTrump said he will notify Congress and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser about the moves.\n\u201cThis is an emergency. This is a tragic emergency,\u201d Trump said.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump suggests crime crackdown could extend to other US cities\nTrump seemed to suggest he could later pursue federal intervention to combat crime in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose our cities over this,\u201d Trump said as he railed against what he called rising crime rates. \u201cAnd this will go further. We\u2019re starting very strongly with D.C., and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly.\u201d\nTrump was flanked by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as he gave his remarks.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump says he\u2019s deploying National Guard, taking control of police department\nTrump said he is sending National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and placing Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump cited authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C.,\" Trump said, touting his moves as \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nSen. Mike Lee: Time to take over DC\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said now is the time for Congress to take control of the city.\n\u201cWe should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe legislation, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\u2212Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\nWhite House says DC\u2019s murder rate leads other national capitals\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2212 an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\u201cRemember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department.\n-Sudiksha Kochi, Josh Meyer and Zac Anderson\nNo DC crime surge, mayor says\nA spokesman for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment ahead of Trump\u2019s news conference.\nBut during an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Bowser pushed back at Trump\u2019s claims of rising crime in Washington. \u201cWe are not experiencing a crime spike,\u201d the mayor said.\nBowser expressed concern about sending the National Guard into the capital, noting that Guard troops are not meant to enforce local laws.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently. And I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our guard,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the guard.\u201d\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump\u2019s threats about taking over Washington.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump threatens to take over DC\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved \u2012 something he floated previously in February.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n-Joey Garrison\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

Under the authorities vested in me as the President of the United States, I'm officially invoking Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. You know what that is -- and placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control,\" Trump said.\nWashington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday said D.C. will follow Trump's orders, but said the move underscored the need for D.C. to make its own decisions and advocated for D.C. statehood. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said the department will work with federal partners, as it has in the past.\n\"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,\" Bowser said.\nTrump has long threatened to take control of D.C., saying he wants to crack down on violent crime in the district although police statistics show that in the past two years, violent crime in Washington, D.C., has fallen dramatically.\nD.C.'s Home Rule Act of 1973 allows D.C. residents to elect a mayor, members of D.C. Council and Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners. The act \"is the result of the ongoing push by District residents for control of their own local affairs,\" according to D.C. Council.\nStill, under the act, there is congressional oversight. Congress reviews all legislation passed by D.C. Council before it can become law and has authority over D.C.'s budget. Additionally, the president appoints D.C.'s judges and D.C. has no voting representation in Congress.\nSection 740 of the Home Rule Act gives the president the ability to use D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department for \"federal purposes\" that the president \"may deem necessary and appropriate.\" On Monday, Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi is taking command of D.C.'s police force.\nSection 740 of the DC Home Rule Act does have some limitations. The emergency control will expire in 30 days, unless the Senate and House enact into law a joint resolution to extend it.\nAsked about the 30-day timeframe on ABC News Live, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said the president has sent a \"real clear message\" about the direction he wants to take D.C.\n\"I think at the end of 30 days, he will make the right decision as to what he is going to do at that point going forward,\" she said.\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton -- the non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives from Washington, D.C. -- called Trump's decision \"an egregious assault on D.C. home rule.\"\n\"There are more than 700,000 D.C. residents, and they are worthy and capable of governing themselves,\" Norton, a Democrat, said in a statement Monday. \"The ultimate solution to ensure D.C. has control of its own resources is passage of my D.C. statehood bill, which would provide D.C. the same protections the states enjoy.\"\nShe says the move helps justify the need to pass legislation she has repeatedly reintroduced to establish statehood in the District of Columbia.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin, in a statement, said he will be introducing a resolution in the House, pursuant to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973, to reverse \"this plainly ridiculous\" state of local emergency and \"restore full home rule powers to the mayor, council and people of the District of Columbia.\"\nIt's unclear when the Maryland Democrat would introduce this legislation. The House is still on their August recess, but he could bring it up during a pro-forma session, which would mean he does not have to wait until next month to introduce it.\nOn Capitol Hill, many Democrats have said the moves are a power grab by the president and a distraction from other matters, such as Trump's involvement with the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\"Violent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low. Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a post on X.\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy said in a post on X that \"Trump's decision to take over the DC police isn't about public safety\" and is \"another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent.\"\nSen. Patty Murray said Trump's decision was a distraction.\n\"He's a pathetic wannabe dictator who wants to distract you from his connection to the Epstein files, skyrocketing costs, and his weak job numbers,\" the Washington Democrat said in a post on X.\nRepublicans have lauded the announcement, claiming that Trump is \"making D.C. safe again.\"\n\"President Trump is RIGHT. We can't allow crime to destroy our Nation's Capital,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a post on X. \"Every American should be able to visit and enjoy Washington, D.C. without fear. House Republicans support this effort to CLEAN UP Washington, END the crime wave, and RESTORE the beauty of the greatest capital in the world.\"\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley applauded Trump's decision, saying on X, \"Make DC beautiful \u2014 and SAFE \u2014 again!\"\nABC News' Jack Date, Isabella Murray and John Parkinson contributed to this report."

      "text": "- The National Guard is a unique branch of the U.S. military that has both state and federal responsibilities.\n- The guard routinely responds to domestic emergencies such as natural disasters and civil unrest, and it supports military operations overseas.\n- In his second term, President Trump has deployed the National Guard to the southern border and expanded its immigration enforcement role. Recently, he ordered troops to D.C., claiming it was necessary to \u201crestore law and order.\u201d\nIntroduction\nThe National Guard is an integral component of the U.S. armed forces, comprised of more than 430,000 civilian soldiers who are able to respond to both domestic crises and overseas conflicts. Over its nearly four-hundred-year history, the guard has transformed from a loose collection of colonial militias into a well-trained and equipped force that often serves side by side with active-duty military personnel.\nThe guard is also distinctive in that it serves under both state and federal command. It has been called upon in recent years to respond to many domestic events, including natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-racism protests, and border security challenges. As its domestic role has grown, the guard has also become more integral to international U.S. military operations. The Air National Guard in particular carries out critical military intelligence analysis, including in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nWhat is the National Guard?\nMore on:\nThe National Guard is unique among the U.S. armed forces in that it can perform state and federal functions. The guard is generally called up to respond to state-level emergencies, such as natural disasters. But, unlike most of the other military forces, it can also serve a domestic law enforcement role. Additionally, the president can deploy the guard to serve missions overseas, as has been done in Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa.\nThe guard\u2019s organization is somewhat unique. It consists of two parts: the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, which are both considered U.S. military reserve components but are distinct from the army and air force reserves. The guard is overseen at the federal level by the National Guard Bureau, the head of which is a four-star general and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military\u2019s top advisory body.\nAs of fiscal year 2023, there were 430,040 guard members [PDF] in total, serving in fifty-four separate organizations across the fifty states, Washington, DC, and three U.S. territories: Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nMany members of the National Guard serve part-time while holding civilian jobs or attending school. Guard members commit to one weekend of training per month plus a minimum of a few weeks of service per year. Most members serve in the states in which they live.\nHow did the National Guard come about?\nThe National Guard traces its origins to the militias established by the American colonies. These militias grew out of the English tradition of organizing citizen-soldiers to provide for the common defense. The guard was established on December 13, 1636, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony created the colonies\u2019 first militia regiments. The state militias were preserved after the founding of the United States, reflecting the balance sought by the Constitution between state and federal authorities.\nMore on:\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until the early twentieth century, particularly after the passage of the 1903 Militia Act and both World Wars, that the guard was transformed from a loosely organized network of militias into the well-equipped and regimented force it remains today. It was also during this period that the state-federal relationship became more defined.\nWho controls the National Guard?\nMost of the time, state National Guards are activated and commanded by the governors of their respective states or territories, but presidents (with input from top officials) can federalize the guard in certain cases. (The DC National Guard is solely under federal control.) For instance, presidents have called units into federal service to respond to extreme weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires, bolster border security, and assist U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Unlike state missions, which generally last less than three months, federal deployments tend to last at least a year.\nOn international missions, the guard is often trained and commanded by active-duty military personnel, and their duties can be identical to their active-duty counterparts; however, hiring and other administrative tasks typically remain managed by state guard units. The National Guard can also be federalized but kept under state control, with the federal government paying for the deployment. (Statewide operations are normally funded by the state.) This was done in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in many states.\nPresidents rarely federalize a state or territory\u2019s guard without the consent of the governor. In June 2025, President Trump bypassed the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom and authorized the deployment of some two thousand National Guard troops to disperse immigration protests in Los Angeles. California authorities swiftly filed a legal challenge to the deployment, arguing it violated the Constitution\u2019s Tenth Amendment. Trump\u2019s actions marked the first time in sixty years that a president had deployed troops without a state governor\u2019s approval; President Lyndon B. Johnson previously did so in 1965, when he sent troops to Alabama to protect civil rights activists. Governors have also at times requested that the federal government assume control over their guard units, as California Governor Pete Wilson did during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\nWhere does the National Guard deploy?\nThe National Guard fulfills a range of duties, including:\nDisaster relief. The guard is frequently called up to respond to statewide emergencies, such as natural disasters. In 2023, members of the Hawaii Army National Guard were mobilized to support disaster response efforts after a massive wildfire on the island of Maui, including by ensuring public order and engaging in search and recovery missions. The guard also prepares every year for the hurricanes that routinely strike the southeastern United States. In the wake of Hurricane Milton in 2024, one of the most intense storms ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin, more than eleven thousand guard members were deployed to support hurricane relief efforts by air, land, and water.\nMilitary support. The National Guard plays a crucial role in supporting U.S. military operations abroad. Since 9/11, more than one million National Guard members have been deployed to missions overseas, including in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as in countries in Europe and the Pacific. Most recently, the National Guard has helped collect and analyze intelligence related to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and assisted in training members of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. Members of the guard have fought in nearly every U.S. conflict since the Revolutionary War, and more than twenty thousand are deployed around the world on any given day.\nThe Air National Guard in particular has played a growing role in military operations, especially in drone operations and data analysis. At some air force bases within the United States, members of the Air National Guard serve alongside active-duty personnel.\nLaw enforcement. The guard can be deployed by state governors for law enforcement purposes. Many states activated their National Guards in response to historic anti-racism protests across the United States after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in May 2020. In January 2021, the DC National Guard was deployed in response to an assault on the U.S. Capitol by a mob backing President Trump while lawmakers were meeting to certify the presidential election. The guard was later quartered inside the Capitol building, evoking comparisons to the Civil War. In March 2024, in response to a surge in subway crime, New York Governor Kathy Hochul dispatched several hundred guard members to help police monitor the city\u2019s busiest stations. In August 2025, Trump ordered the deployment of eight hundred National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to crack down on crime and homelessness, as well as address what he said was a broader loss of \u201ccontrol of public order and safety\u201d in the city.\nBorder Security. The National Guard is part of the complex multiagency border security apparatus. As of January 2025, there were around four thousand National Guard troops deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. Some of these troops are on federal missions, directed by the president; others are run by states. At times, non-border states such as Florida and South Dakota have sent their own National Guards to the border. These troops primarily serve in an administrative capacity, with a directive against performing \u201claw enforcement functions.\u201d\nElection support. The guard has provided cybersecurity support in recent years to state and local governments administering elections, including the 2020 presidential contest. Due to the pandemic, guard members performed additional election-related duties, including staffing polling places in some states\u2014although they wore plain clothes to avoid the perception of military involvement in the political process. Guard members were also deployed during the 2024 presidential election in response to threats against election infrastructure, including the burning of ballot drop boxes in Oregon and Washington.\nState partnerships. The guard\u2019s State Partnership Program (SPP) aims to increase state military-to-military relationships as a critical U.S. security cooperation tool. Administered by the National Guard Bureau, the SPP boasts partnerships with more than one hundred partner countries around the world. For example, the California Air National Guard\u2019s partnership with Ukraine proved pivotal during the early stages of Russia\u2019s invasion.\nWhat controversies have there been over the National Guard?\nIn a few instances, presidents and governors have clashed over the military\u2019s domestic law enforcement role, particularly during periods of civil unrest. While governors can call on guard members to serve as temporary law enforcers, presidents cannot do so under normal circumstances. The Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the president from using the military in this role. However, presidents can circumvent this law by invoking the Insurrection Act. For example, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the law to federalize the Arkansas National Guard to enforce desegregation of the state\u2019s schools following the governor\u2019s refusal to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education decision. President John F. Kennedy did the same in Alabama and Mississippi.\nDebate over the domestic use of the military flared once again in 2020 amid nationwide anti-racism protests sparked by Floyd\u2019s death. After Trump threatened to deploy the military to quell civil unrest in parts of the country, some Republican lawmakers urged him to do so using the Insurrection Act. Instead, he asked governors to send their National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to aid the federal response there, which was widely criticized as heavy-handed and legally murky. Trump also drew criticism for sending federal agents to several U.S. cities during the protests, including Portland, Oregon. Some Democratic lawmakers have suggested changing the law to prevent such an action.\nIn contrast, the federal response to rioters\u2019 breach of the U.S. Capitol in January 2021 was criticized as slow and insufficient. Because Washington, DC, is not a state, the president or Pentagon must give the order for a guard deployment there. Then Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller ultimately deployed more than one thousand guard members, but some analysts questioned why they had not been positioned near the Capitol preemptively. Tens of thousands of additional guard troops were mobilized in the days following the attack to ensure a peaceful transition of power.\nMeanwhile, at the southern U.S. border, National Guard deployments have been criticized for lacking the jurisdiction to implement U.S. immigration policy. Critics say poor working conditions for state deployments, including Texas\u2019s Operation Lone Star, have rendered them particularly ineffective; others say such deployments are necessary to fill gaps in border patrol. After returning to office in January 2025, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, allowing him to deploy additional personnel, including National Guard members, to support border security efforts. Some experts say the use of guard members to support federal immigration officials blurs the line between civilian policing and military operations.\nIn 2023, the Air National Guard\u2019s expansive role in the military\u2019s foreign surveillance and intelligence operations drew intense scrutiny after the FBI arrested a twenty-one-year-old guardsman for leaking highly classified documents. Jack Teixeira\u2019s disclosures contained top-secret information on the war in Ukraine and internal communications of U.S. partners Israel and South Korea. Critics, including some high-ranking U.S. lawmakers, called for reforms to the system for maintaining classified documents. Others questioned whether those outside the National Guard\u2019s highest levels should have access to critical military intelligence.\nRecommended Resources\nIn I Am the Guard, Michael Doubler chronicles the nearly four-hundred-year history [PDF] of the Army National Guard.\nFor Just Security, Syracuse University\u2019s William Banks looks at domestic use of the military and efforts to federalize the National Guard.\nThe Washington Post details President Trump\u2019s controversial decision to deploy National Guard units in the nation\u2019s capital in response to protests.\nFor the U.S. Marine Corps University\u2019s Journal of Advanced Military Studies, Army National Guardsman Michael G.

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump announced plans to deploy National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., and take control of the city's Metropolitan Police Department, citing a public safety emergency despite declining crime rates in the capital. Under the Home Rule Act, Trump has the authority to assume control of the police for up to 30 days without congressional approval. The move has drawn criticism from local officials and Democrats, who argue it is unnecessary and a power grab, while some Republicans support the action as a means to restore order.",
