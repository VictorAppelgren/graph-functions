      "feedback": "The draft is on‑target for the DXY but still drifts into equity‑centric language (“Fed policy drives the S&P 500”) and includes a generic “Fed policy drives the S&P 500” paragraph that is irrelevant to the focus. Remove that entire paragraph or re‑frame it to a concise, DXY‑only causal chain (Fed cuts → lower term premium → higher dollar yield → DXY rise). Tighten the base‑case sentence to a single, bullet‑style line: “Fed’s September 25‑bp cut, coupled with a 2.5 % July CPI, will lift DXY 0.5–1 % over 3–6 mo (XTQIQRP5K)(NIT6JFIQF)(FAN5RYW6T).” Replace the “key risks” paragraph with a focused risk list that maps directly to DXY: (1) Fed rate hike or CPI >3 % (XTQIQRP5K), (2) Trump tariff reversal (XQMF22EFB), (3) sudden risk‑aversion shift (FAN5RYW6T). Ensure every risk has a causal link to DXY (e.g., higher rates → lower dollar yield → DXY fall). Condense watch signals into a single sentence: “Watch July CPI/PCE, Fed minutes, Treasury curve steepening, DXY weekly momentum, EUR/USD, and tariff announcements (XTQIQRP5K)(XQMF22EFB).” Finally, add a quantitative confidence band: “Confidence moderate (±0.25 % DXY) given current policy signals.” This keeps the brief within 4–6 bullet‑style sentences, eliminates extraneous equity discussion, and satisfies the handle‑mapping and catalyst‑window requirements.",
