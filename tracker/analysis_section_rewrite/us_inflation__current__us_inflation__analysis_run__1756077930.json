      "feedback": "The draft kinesthetically ties a wide set of sources into a plausible 0–3 week narrative, but its causal chain is too diffuse and its near-term drivers aren’t tightly anchored to observable events; it leans on Krugman’s stagflation warning and on investment pledges (218AGGUXB) while invoking Lagarde’s central‑bank independ­ence (U6HXAJR4J) and cooling costs (LLN6N4H3Z) without a crisp, testable transmission mechanism from policy/news to price/volume channels, and it underweights immediate data flow (inflation prints, tariff moves, Intel stake dynamics) that will actually move markets in days, not weeks (218AGGUXB; U6HXAJR4J). To upgrade, recast as a tight, citation‑dense, 0–3 week playbook: 1) define three explicit, testable catalysts with thresholds (e.g., tariff escalation/de-escalation signals, new inflation prints, Intel CHIPS grant/stock moves, and the 10% Intel stake’s governance signal) and mark invalidation rules (e.g., if inflation prints remain entrenched or if the Intel stake governance remains nonbinding for 2 weeks) and tie each to a market reaction function (risk premia, equity/AI capex, dollar funding costs) drawn directly from sources (218AGGUXB; LLN6N4H3Z; U6HXAJR4J; 218AGGUXB). 2) construct a concise, first‑principles transmission: policy uncertainty and protectionist signals raise real costs and pricing power distortion, which Krugman warns could tilt toward stagflation unless AI investment remains robust; quantify that AI capex impulse using the magnitude of pledges cited (e.g., Apple, NVIDIA, TSMC, Micron, IBM, Google—all in 218AGGUXB/Source 3) and pair with a plausible supply‑side/price path if AI momentum falters (CDBMWIUTB; LLN6N4H3Z). 3) adopt a clean, near‑term scenario framework (base, upside, downside) with explicit triggers and probability weights, and explicitly reconcile conflicts (e.g., Cuban’s inflation‑not‑up vs Krugman’s stagflation risk; Lagarde’s independence vs Powell’s credibility) by assigning bounded probabilities and stating how these shape risk premia now (218AGGUXB; U6HXAJR4J; LLN6N4H3Z). 4) sharpen the “watchlist” and thresholds: inflation prints and Fed/ECB commentary, Intel governance signals, CHIPS grant pacing, AI investment cadence, and European‑U.S. policy alignment, with concrete price/level cues (e.g., how much risk premia moves with a 0.2–0.3 pp surprise in CPI, or a policy communiqué from Jackson Hole) drawn from the cited material (218AGGUXB; LLN6N4H3Z; U6HXAJR4J). 5) tighten formatting and attribution so each claim is anchored to a single source or clearly reconciled pair, and explicitly note any conflicts between sources (e.g., 195M infrastructure grant context vs Mace’s rhetoric in Independent articles, if you keep them) with cross‑source references (A6V3EB8XL; LLN6N4H3Z; 218AGGUXB). 6) replace broad statements with quantified ranges wherever possible (e.g., “AI investments total hundreds of billions to trillions” with the explicit figures listed in TRUMP EFFECT and 218AGGUXB; 195M/8.7B Intel stake; $1,500–$14,000 cost ranges for cooling; 6.43% loan rate from the Fed‑reporting line in SlashGear), to avoid platitudes and to raise signal fidelity (CDBMWIUTB; LLN6N4H3Z; 218AGGUXB). The result should be a concise, testable, numerically grounded 0–3 week framework with a tight causal chain, clearly stated catalysts/levels/invalidations, and a disciplined use of the six core sources (218AGGUXB; A6V3EB8XL; LLN6N4H3Z; U6HXAJR4J; CDBMWIUTB).",
