  "title": "Stop spiders coming into your home this mating season with three scents",
  "description": "These specific fragrances could deter these eight-legged creatures coming into your house.",
  "content": "Brits have been advised to try out three different fragrances at home in order to deter some unwanted visitors. Certain scents could work wonders for warding off spiders. These eight-legged creatures usually start to migrate indoors in late mid to late August as temperatures start to cool. On top of this we are also coming up to spider mating season, which starts in September, and sees male spiders coming into homes on the hunt for females. So what can you do to try to spider-proof your home? Luckily there are some simple tricks you can try - including some that even smell good.\n\nAccording to Country Living, strong scents act as \u201cgreat\u201d spider deterrents. For this reason it recommends using peppermint oil as a way to ward off the creatures. \u201cAdd 15 to 20 drops to a spray bottle filled with water and spritz around the house, changing the oil used regularly to ensure the remedy remains effective,\u201d the magazine suggests. Tea tree, lavender and rose are also some strong smells that could work in the same way. Similarly, spiders are said to be repelled by the smell of cinnamon. So why not try stocking up on dried sticks used for cooking, fragrance oils and scented candles to keep your home spider free?\n\nCitrus is another smell that spiders can\u2019t stand. Country Living says: \u201cSpiders supposedly hate all citrus scents, so rub orange or lemon peel along skirting boards, window sills and bookshelves. \u201cUse lemon-scented cleaners and burn citronella candles both inside and outside of your home.\u201d On its website, Pest UK explains that spiders like to hide away including in any clutter or rubbish that's found in your home. Therefore, its experts advise people to clear away clutter and vacuum regularly. You might also contemplate introducing the following plants into your home, which are recognised for their spider-deterrent properties:",

      "text": "\u2022 Find out how to get rid of spiders in the house and how to prevent spiders from coming in.\n\u2022 The below are all natural spider deterrents that won't cause them, or you, any harm.\n\u2022 Find out if conkers really repel spiders in the home.\nWhat to Read Next\nThe majority of spiders are harmless to humans, but most people still don't like sharing their home with any eight-legged friends. You're likely to spot these creepy crawlies indoors during autumn and winter, when shorter, darker days and colder temperatures see their annual migration from our gardens to our houses, but it's not unusual at any time of year.\nDuring late summer and autumn months, especially during September and October, there may be increased spider activity as the male spiders begin their search for a mate. Fortunately, there are plenty of natural spider deterrents that will deter arachnids from setting up in your place without causing them any harm.\nSpider deterrents: 18 ways to get rid of spiders naturally\n\"Windows provide easy access for pesky spiders and bugs to enter our properties, but there's plenty of ways to deter them,\" says Adam Pawson, Head of Digital at Safestyle UK.\n\"Spiders aren't big fans of strong scents, acidic concoctions or dark corners. By following a few of these simple hacks, you can sleep a little easier at night knowing the bugs are at bay.\"\n1. Spider catcher\nThis spider catcher is one of Lakeland's best-selling spider deterrents. The clever battery-operated vacuum gently picks up creepy crawlies so you can take them outside without hurting them. There are other non-vacuum styles available too.\n2. Peppermint oil\nLots of strong scents are great spider deterrents and, luckily, many are already used traditionally as home fragrances. Peppermint oil is a particularly popular remedy, as are tea tree, lavender, and rose. Care should be taken when using tea tree oil, as it could pose a threat to dogs.\nAdd 15 to 20 drops to a spray bottle filled with water and spritz around the house, changing the oil used regularly to ensure the remedy remains effective.\n3. Cinnamon\nSpiders also dislike the smell of cinnamon. This warm spice comes in various forms, including dried sticks used for cooking, fragrance oils, and scented candles. With its rich, wintery scent, cinnamon is an especially good option for the festive period!\n4. Vinegar\nWhile not as fragrant as the above solutions, vinegar can also assist in warding off spiders. Fill a spray bottle with half white vinegar and half water and spray in corners, cracks and crevices. Be careful to avoid varnished surfaces as it can cause damage.\n5. Get cleaning\nSpiders like having somewhere to hide, so keep your house neat and tidy through regular tidying, cleaning and decluttering to prevent mess from building up.\nPlastic storage containers are better than cardboard boxes as they are harder for spiders to crawl into. Make sure to dust and vacuum frequently to rid your house of unwanted webs.\n6. Regularly check your fruit bowl\nFruit flies are a delicious snack for spiders. Check your fruit bowl regularly for gone-off food that might attract them. In rare cases, spiders may be accidentally transported with the fruit during the harvesting process, or may have even been left on the fruit by growers as a form of natural pest control, so always wash your fruit before eating.\n7. Protect the exterior of your house\nStop spiders from getting indoors in the first place by moving anything they're likely to hide in, such as leaves, grass clippings, vegetation, compost or woodpiles away from exterior walls.\nCheck door openings and window sills for cracks they could crawl through and seal with caulk. Fix torn window screens and cover vents and chimneys with fine mesh.\n8. Plant a eucalyptus tree in the garden\nThis tree is low maintenance and smells wonderful, with the added perk that the leaves' strong medicinal scent also repels spiders. If you don't have room for a full tree, plant mint or lavender underneath or near windows, as the smell will help drive spiders away.\n9. Citrus\nSpiders supposedly hate all citrus scents, so rub orange or lemon peel along skirting boards, window sills and bookshelves. Use lemon-scented cleaners and burn citronella candles both inside and outside of your home.\n10. Turn off your lights\nWhile light itself doesn't attract spiders, it does attract the insects they feast on. Turn off outside lights when not needed and stop indoor bulbs from shining through windows by using opaque blinds and shades.\nIf you do need to keep them on, use yellow sodium vapour lights, as these are less likely to attract insects.\n11. Conkers\nOld wives' tales have it that spiders are repelled by chestnuts. Unlike peppermint spray, scattering a few conkers on windowsills and in corners isn't scientifically proven to work, but it certainly won't do any harm and many people swear by it as a deterrent.\nWarning! Conkers can be poisonous to animals so please consult your vet before putting them in your home if you have pets.\n12. Cedar\nAnother scent spiders are said to detest. Hauling a cedar plant into your home isn't practical, but there are many smaller cedar products available to help you give this one a try.\nAs a bonus, the woody aroma should also repel clothes moths \u2014 so keep some of these disks in your wardrobe as well. Just sand them down every now and then to refresh the scent.\n13. Garlic\nIt's known for its vampire-repelling properties but, as it turns out, spiders don't like the smell of this pungent bulb either.\nDepending on how strong a scent you can cope with, put whole or crushed cloves into a spray bottle filled with water and use to fragrance the corners, floors and skirting boards of rooms prone to unwanted guests.\n14. Move your bins\nSpiders are attracted to flies and flies are attracted to bins. Make sure yours are kept as far from the house as possible \u2014 at least away from windows and doors. Always keep bin lids closed, too.\n15. Consider a cat\nThis method will undoubtedly harm the spider as cats are expert hunters, but it does prevent the use of insecticides and chemicals in the home.\nThey won't be suitable for every household due to allergies and lifestyle but, if you are a cat person, they are excellent spider repellents.\n16. Cover your pet food\nTalking of cats and all other household pets, it's important to keep their food covered and sealed so it doesn't attract flies and insects which will, in turn, draw in spiders.\n17. Seal any cracks in exterior walls\nThis will prevent unwanted pests entering your home and help keep your house warm at the same time. Survey for cracks in external walls and around door edges and windows, and seal them closed.\n18. Take your recycling out regularly\nLeftover food or sugary drinks in discarded packaging attracts flies and, in turn, spiders. Empty bottles and cans also make good homes for arachnids so empty your recycling boxes regularly.\nHannah Fox is Good Housekeeping UK\u2019s Ecommerce Editor, testing and reviewing products across homes, gardening, fashion and travel, and reporting on the best deals during sales events including Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday.\nSince 2014, Hannah has written homes, wellness, women\u2019s health and lifestyle content for numerous UK titles including Country Living, House Beautiful, Cosmopolitan and Harper's Bazaar, and published a book in 2019.\nBefore becoming a journalist, Hannah worked in SEO for five years, writing optimised content and conducting technical audits.
