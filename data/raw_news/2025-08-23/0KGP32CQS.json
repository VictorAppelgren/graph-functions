  "title": "If I Could Only Buy 1 S&P 500 Stock From Each Sector for the Rest of 2025, I'd Go With These 11 Dividend Stocks",
  "description": "Incorporating top stocks from a variety of sectors can be an effective way to balance out an investment portfolio.",
  "content": "Incorporating top stocks from a variety of sectors can be an effective way to balance out an investment portfolio.\n\nThe Global Industry Classification Standard assigns each stock into a market sector to make it easier for investors to compare companies to their peers and track broader market movements.\n\nThe system isn't perfect. For example, Amazon (AMZN 3.12%) is in the consumer discretionary sector even though its cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, is its most valuable segment -- meaning Amazon is arguably more of a technology company. But overall, the system is useful for achieving portfolio diversification and seeing which sectors are outperforming or underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.52%).\n\nHere are the 11 stocks I would choose if I could only buy one dividend stock from each sector for the rest of the year.\n\nThe technology sector makes up just over a third of the S&P 500 with a 34% weighting. The tech sector includes the three largest companies in the world -- Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. My top tech stock for the rest of 2025 is Texas Instruments (TXN 2.67%).\n\nThe company is an industry veteran that makes analog and embedded semiconductors. It's not a pure artificial intelligence (AI) play. But Texas Instruments is unique in that it has a highly diversified business. The company stands to benefit from the growth of edge AI, which involves AI on a device level rather than in the cloud.\n\nWith 21 consecutive years of dividend raises and a 2.7% yield, Texas Instruments stands out as a unique way to invest in tech while generating a sizable amount of passive income.\n\nFinancials are the second-largest stock market sector with a 13.8% weight in the S&P 500. Payment processors have wide moats, rock-solid business models, and extremely high margins.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP 3.47%) takes it a step further by acting as both a payment processor and a card issuer. Issuing cards adds risk to the business, but American Express has an excellent track record of managing that risk, as evidenced by its low net write-off rate.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector makes up 10.4% of the S&P 500. The sector can be highly cyclical and sensitive to macro data from the broader economy, housing market, interest rates, and more. Starbucks (SBUX -0.27%) is my top pick from the sector because the company's turnaround is going well and the dividend is excellent.\n\nLast August, Starbucks poached Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol to get Starbucks back on track to consistent international growth. Niccol's Starbucks hasn't been perfect, but it's much more organized and focused on improving customer service.\n\nWith 14 consecutive years of boosting the payout and a 2.7% yield, Starbucks stands out as a top consumer discretionary stock for generating passive income.\n\nThe communications sector comes in at 9.9% of the S&P 500. Alphabet (GOOGL 3.10%) (GOOG 2.98%) stands out as a high-conviction pick due to its diverse business model and dirt cheap valuation.\n\nFears of Al disrupting Google Search are overblown. Google Search continues to grow at an impressive rate. And adoption for Google Gemini, Alphabet's Chatbot, has been accelerating.\n\nAlphabet announced its first dividend last year, but it only yields 0.4% .\n\nHealthcare now only makes up 8.8% of the S&P 500 because the sector has been under pressure due to sell-offs in companies like Eli Lilly (LLY 0.13%).\n\nEli Lilly is an exciting company in the space because of existing drugs, especially for weight loss and diabetes -- as well as its pipeline of drugs in development.\n\nThe company passes along capital directly to shareholders through its growing dividend.\n\nIndustrials are right behind healthcare with an 8.6% weighting in the S&P 500. Investors are getting a great value for industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (HON 2.43%).\n\nHoneywell is splitting into three separate businesses to unlock value for shareholders. At 24.7 times earnings and with a 2.1% dividend yield, Honeywell is a good buy for folks who believe the company will be more innovative and flexible as three independent entities.\n\nConsumer staples make up 5.2% of the S&P 500. The sector has been struggling due to inflationary pressures on consumers. So it's best to approach consumer staples with an emphasis on quality.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG -0.14%) is as quality as it gets, with a 2.7% dividend yield and 69 consecutive years of boosting its payout, strong pricing power, and a diverse lineup of industry-leading products spanning beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby, feminine, and family care.\n\nLike consumer staples, the energy sector has been under pressure from relatively low oil prices. There's also the ongoing risk of the energy transition as oil and gas demand could fall over the coming decades.\n\nIntegrated major ExxonMobil (XOM 1.72%) provides a straightforward way to mitigate the sector's risks. ExxonMobil has a low cost of production, diversified portfolio across upstream, product solutions, and low carbon.\n\nExxonMobil has 42 consecutive years of increasing its payout and a high yield of 3.7%.\n\nThe utilities sector makes up just 2.5% of the S&P 500. But it's one of the best sectors for generating reliable passive income.\n\nSouthern Company (SO -0.15%) is hovering around an all-time high due to steadily rising demand from residential, commercial, and industrial customers and AI-related tailwinds in Southern Company's wheelhouse in the Southeastern U.S.\n\nWith a yield of 3.1%, Southern Company is a reliable passive income powerhouse that's worth buying now.\n\nThe real estate sector makes up 2% of the S&P 500. The sector includes companies that own, manage, and develop property, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) that generate income from rental properties.\n\nMid-America Apartment Communities (MAA 1.43%) is a REIT that specializes in multifamily apartment complexes in the Sun Belt. The company has an excellent track record of maintaining its dividend, which has never decreased over the 30 years that it has been paid. The dividend has increased significantly in recent years, boosting the yield to 4.3%.\n\nThe materials sector makes up just 1.8% of the S&P 500. Sherwin-Williams (SHW 2.52%) is the lone materials stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and it's a perfect representative for the sector.\n\nThe company has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years and consistently repurchases its stock. The company does much more than residential paint, including a thriving industrial and commercial business that includes paint and coatings for industrial wood, marine, automotive, and more. It operates its own stores and works with retailers like Lowe's and Walmart.\n\nSherwin-Williams only yields 0.9%, but that's due to the stock's strong long-term performance rather than a lack of commitment to growing the dividend.",

      "text": "2025 has featured no shortage of news items, from new all-time highs in the major stock market indexes in February to tariffs and trade tensions, a swift and brutal drawdown across many top stocks, a rapid recovery, and now Middle East uncertainty.\nVolatility is a good reminder of the importance of holding quality companies in your portfolio that you are confident in holding even when faced with the unexpected. Procter & Gamble (PG -0.14%) is one of the largest and most well-run consumer staples companies. The dividend stock has pulled back recently and is now hovering around a 52-week low.\nHere's why the sell-off is a buying opportunity for investors looking to generate reliable passive income.\n1. Competitive advantages\nThe best consumer staples and packaged goods companies have a portfolio of well-managed and well-known brands that can lead to high margins and sustained growth. P&G has several leading brands across beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby, feminine, and family care. Because its brand lineup is so strong, P&G has enjoyed immense success expanding its brands internationally. In fact, P&G's international sales exceed its domestic sales.\nP&G does a masterful job of leveraging its global supply chain and marketing to ensure that it benefits from diversification. Too often, multinational companies with many brands can depend too much on a handful of brands to drive margin growth and get bogged down by underperformers.\nHowever, what separates P&G from the competition is that it focuses more on expanding its existing brand lineup than overly relying on acquisitions. Relative to its size, P&G hasn't made a blockbuster acquisition since buying Gillette 20 years ago for $57 billion.\n2. Growing cash leads to growing dividends\nP&G's growth has been fairly mediocre in recent years. But the quality of the company's earnings is unmatched in its industry.\nAs you can see in the chart, P&G has steadily expanded its margins and free cash flow (FCF) per share, which supports its growing dividend. In April, P&G increased its dividend for the 69th consecutive year -- giving it one of the longest streaks among companies that have raised their dividends for at least 50 years (known as Dividend Kings). Despite that track record, P&G only yields 2.6% -- partially because the stock has been a long-term winner with a 167% total return (capital gains plus dividends) over the last decade.\nWhile there are plenty of other value stocks in the consumer staples sector with higher yields than P&G, few companies compare when considering the quality of earnings growth and the full scope of the capital return program.\nAs mentioned, P&G generates far more FCF than it needs to pay dividends. So, it has plenty of dry powder to repurchase its stock consistently. Buying back stock brings down the share count and boosts earnings per share. In the last five years, P&G has decreased its share count by 5.5%, and by 13.6% over the last decade.\nThanks to the power of buybacks, P&G has four levers it can pull to grow earnings -- sales volume growth, price increases, operating margin expansion, and stock buybacks.\n3. P&G is a fair value\nP&G commands a premium valuation relative to other companies in its sector because it is an industry leader in many different consumer categories and has a track record of steady earnings, FCF, and dividends.\nOne glance at P&G's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.3 may suggest that the stock is overvalued compared to other options. But look closer, and P&G is a fair price.\nP&G's P/E and price-to-FCF ratios are right around five-year median levels. And its forward P/E suggests P&G could begin to look cheap if the stock price stagnates and earnings continue climbing higher.\nA balanced buy for risk-averse investors\nThere are far cheaper stocks than P&G with higher yields. So, P&G definitely isn't a good fit for folks looking for bargain-bin passive income options.\nHowever, P&G could be a foundational holding for investors looking for a company they can count on even during economic downturns and geopolitical uncertainty.\nP&G has seen quarterly fluctuations in volume growth and pricing power. But overall, it has done an impeccable job managing consumer spending weakness, especially considering many of its peers are facing eroding margins.\nAdd it all up, and P&G is an excellent choice for investors who value dividend quality over quantity."

      "text": "The materials sector produces many of the building blocks needed to make the things we use every day. That makes it an important industry for investors to know about.\nThe materials sector includes a wide variety of companies, including those that manufacture or mine:\n- Chemicals, plastics, and glass.\n- Construction materials.\n- Paper, forest products, and packaging products.\n- Metals and minerals.\nDemand for materials is cyclical, making the sector's participants highly susceptible to changes in the economy. If economic conditions weaken, demand for basic materials tends to decline, lowering prices and affecting profitability for materials producers.\nThe economic cycle, however, is only one of many factors that can affect the materials sector. Supply chain issues, legislation, and inflation are just some of the other factors that can affect demand, prices, and industry profitability for the materials sector.\nTop materials stocks\nTop materials stocks in 2025\nAlthough many companies operate in the materials industry, the following four stand out as some of the top materials stocks for investors to consider:\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Industry |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) | $79 billion | Metals and Mining |\n| Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP) | $8 billion | Construction Materials |\n| Air Products And Chemicals (NYSE:APD) | $67 billion | Chemicals |\n| Nucor (NYSE:NUE) | $34 billion | Metals and Mining |\nCompanies 1 - 2\n1. Rio Tinto\nRio Tinto is one of the world's leading mining companies. The London-based company produces the three top industrial metals -- iron ore, aluminum, and copper -- and several other important metals and minerals, including lithium.\nRio Tinto focuses on these industrial metals because they are the ones the global economy most commonly consumes. The uses for iron ore, aluminum, and copper are numerous and growing:\n- Iron ore: The primary material for making the steel used for cars, appliances, buildings, wind turbines, and other infrastructure.\n- Aluminum: A lightweight metal and a vital component for many technology applications. Aluminum is used to make jet engines, electric vehicles, and mobile phones.\n- Copper: Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity, making it essential for electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and for producing solar energy. It is also a vital component of many technology applications.\nAlthough these metals are highly sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy, demand for the metals Rio Tinto produces should continue to grow.\nRio Tinto is also becoming a global leader in supplying energy transition metals. It bought lithium producer Arcadium Lithium for $6.7 billion in 2025 to become a major lithium producer. Rio Tinto also agreed to invest $2.5 billion in late 2024 to expand its Rincon project in Argentina, where it's building its first commercial-scale lithium operation.\nThe company also boasts a strong balance sheet and some of the lowest-cost operations in the world. It has the financial flexibility to expand its operations while returning cash to investors via share repurchases and dividend payments. As a result, Rio Tinto is well-positioned to cope with changes in demand for these commodities and create value for its shareholders.\n2. Nucor\nNucor is the largest and most diversified steel and steel products company in North America. It\u2019s also the continent\u2019s largest steel recycler.\nThe company\u2019s focus on steel positions it for two megatrends. First, steel is essential for making wind turbines, so it\u2019s vital to the renewable energy industry. Steel is also crucial for infrastructure, such as bridges and railways, making it a beneficiary of increased infrastructure spending in the U.S.\nNucor has a low and highly variable cost structure. Because of that, it has a long history of generating free cash flow throughout the cycle. The steelmaker has maintained a strong balance sheet, and it is now a Dividend King after 50+ years of growing their dividend payments.\nCompanies 3 - 4\n3. Air Products & Chemicals\nAir Products & Chemicals is one of the world\u2019s leading industrial gas companies. It supplies essential industrial gases to the refining, chemical, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage industries. It\u2019s also a leading global supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) process technology and equipment.\nThe company is a major supplier of hydrogen, which could play an important role in fueling the economy in the future. In addition, its expertise in carbon capture and storage could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Add that to its importance to the growth of LNG, a widely used fuel, and Air Products is playing a vital role in helping the global economy transition to cleaner energy sources.\nAir Products also boasts a strong financial profile, including an excellent balance sheet and healthy cash flow. That gives it the financial flexibility to expand its operations and pay a growing dividend.\n4. Eagle Materials\nEagle Materials is a leading U.S. building materials producer. It manufactures heavy materials (cement, concrete, and aggregates) and light materials (gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard). These materials are crucial to the construction industry.\nEagle Materials strategically focuses on operating heavy materials manufacturing capacity in the U.S. heartland, limiting the impact of competition from imports. Meanwhile, it concentrates its light materials manufacturing capacity in the southern portion of the country, where home construction is rising. These features enable it to benefit from higher prices and make more money on the materials it produces.\nEagle Materials produces a lot of cash, giving it the funds to expand its operations and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It has expanded its heavy materials operations by acquiring Bullskin Stone & Lime, a pure-play aggregates asset in Pennsylvania, for $152.5 million in late 2024. Meanwhile, it announced plans to spend $330 million to modernize and expand its gypsum wallboard plant in Oklahoma in mid-2025. Those investments will help increase its earnings and shareholder value.\nWhy do Investors buy materials stocks?\nInvestors buy basic materials stocks for several reasons, including:\n- To benefit from economic growth.\n- As an inflation hedge.\n- To diversify their portfolio.\n- To benefit from the stable and growing demand for basic materials.\n- To capitalize on the long-term growth potential of certain basic materials, like those benefiting from strong demand drivers, such as lithium, rare earths, and nickel.\n- To potentially collect dividend income.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nShould you invest in materials stocks?\nWhile all companies in the basic materials sector face risks related to the health of the economy, the best materials companies are well-positioned financially and benefit from a diversified portfolio of operations. The top materials companies have multiple businesses, investment-grade bond ratings, manageable debt, and low production costs. These factors enable them to still make money even when materials prices decline.\nMaterials companies are more likely to perform well when the economy is booming, making these companies a better buy in bull markets. But, even when the economy is growing, fierce competition in the materials sector tends to restrict companies' abilities to generate substantial profit, which affects share prices.\nInvestors need to be very picky when choosing materials stocks. They need to focus their attention on well-run, financially strong companies with visible growth prospects. A sharp focus increases the probability that materials stocks can deliver attractive returns for investors.\nFAQ\nFAQ on materials stocks\nWhat are material shares?\nMaterials shares are another name for basic materials stocks. These are publicly traded companies that extract, process, and sell raw materials. They are in industries like mining, chemicals, construction materials, and paper and packaging products.\nWhat materials are in high demand?\nMany materials are in high demand. For example, demand for steel, copper, aluminum, and wood is high due to their usage in construction. Meanwhile, demand for metals like cobalt, lithium, nickel, and rare earths is high due to their usage for clean energy and technology.\nWhat industry is in high demand right now?\nSeveral industries are in high demand right now, including technology, healthcare, and energy. Demand for certain basic materials is high due to their usage by the technology and energy sector, such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, and rare earths.\nWhat are the most undervalued basic material stocks?\nAccording to Morningstar analysts, the most undervalued basic materials stocks in mid-2025 were:\n- Lithium Argentina (NYSE: LAR)\n- Albemarle (NYSE: ALB)\n- FMC (NYSE: FMC)\n- Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC)\n- Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile (NYSE: SQM)\nAre basic material stocks a good buy now?\nBasic materials stocks could be a good buy now. The basic materials industry is cyclical, meaning demand rises as the economy expands and declines during a recession. If we're currently in an economic expansion, basic materials stocks would be a good buy. However, if we're in a recession or heading towards one, they wouldn't be worth buying until the economy bottomed and was about to start recovering."

      "text": "There are about 55 companies that qualify as Dividend Kings -- meaning they have boosted their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years. The list will likely grow as existing Dividend Kings retain their status and new companies gain the distinction.\nHere's why Sherwin-Williams (SHW 2.52%), Pentair (PNR 3.88%), and McDonald's (MCD 0.18%) are all on track to become Dividend Kings within the next five years and are worth buying now.\nSherwin-Williams has excelled at growing shareholder value -- and should continue to do so in the future\nScott Levine (Sherwin-Williams): Professional painters and DIYers will certainly recognize the name Sherwin-Williams, but income investors will likely know the name for its extended commitment to rewarding shareholders. Over the past 46 years, Sherwin-Williams, whose stock currently offers a forward yield of 0.93, has provided investors with increasing dividend payouts. If the streak continues for another four years, the company will be coronated as a Dividend King.\nWith origins going back to 1866, Sherwin-Williams has a long history that extends beyond its time as a dividend superstar. From its simple beginning until today, Sherwin-Williams has evolved into an industry stalwart, specializing in paints and coatings for automotive and marine applications, industrial wood coatings, and a variety of others. In addition to more than 5,400 stores and branches, Sherwin-Williams operates over 140 manufacturing and distribution facilities.\nAlthough the stock's 0.93% forward yield is modest, the allure of Sherwin-Williams stock as a passive income play is in the sustainability of its payout. Over the past decade, Sherwin-Williams has maintained an extremely conservative 26.6% payout ratio. Plus, the company generates ample free cash flow to cover the distributions.\nWhile some companies boast of impressive streaks of dividend raises -- all the while notching nominal boosts to their payout -- Sherwin-Williams has done the opposite. From 2014 through 2024, the company has raised its dividend at a 14.6% compound annual growth rate.\nFor conservative investors looking for rock-solid income investments, Sherwin-Williams demands consideration. The stock is sensitive to activity in the housing market and industrial demand. However, investors who are comfortable riding out the temporary volatility will benefit over the long term.\nSolid end markets and ongoing margin expansion make Pentair an attractive stock to buy\nLee Samaha (Pentair): This water products company has increased its dividend for 49 consecutive years, and is therefore on the cusp of becoming a Dividend King. As always with Dividend Kings, it's not just the dividend itself or the yield that's important; it's the reason why the company has been able to raise its dividend for so many consecutive years.\nIn Pentair's case, it's the solidity of its end markets, which include fluid treatment and pump products and systems (Flow segment), commercial and residential water treatment solutions (Water Solutions), and energy-efficient pool solutions (Pool).\nThere are two reasons to buy the stock. First, its end markets, as outlined above, depend on the need to maintain and improve water infrastructure, the growth of commercial and residential developments, as well as urbanization, and ongoing demand for pool products from an ever-growing installed base of pools in the U.S.\nThe second reason stems from management's transformational initiatives, which continue to drive profit margins higher through more targeted pricing, reduced sourcing complexity, the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques, and a focus on developing and selling key products to key customers that account for the majority of its business, using the 80/20 rule.\nThese initiatives have driven operating margin from 18.6% in 2022 to an estimated 25% in 2025 and then 26% in 2026, helping Pentair stock rise 45% since the start of 2022.\nMcDonald's business model supports a growing dividend\nDaniel Foelber (McDonald's): In September 2024, McDonald's raised its dividend to $1.77 per share per quarter, marking its 48th consecutive year of boosting the payout. That puts McDonald's on track to reach 50 years of dividend increases by next year.\nMcDonald's has the ideal business model for consistently returning cash to shareholders through dividends. Franchisees own and operate 95% of McDonald's restaurants -- paying McDonald's fees like rent and royalties. McDonald's offers franchises different options, depending on how much skin they want in the game.\nHalf of McDonald's stores operate using a conventional license where McDonald's pays for the building and real estate, the franchisee pays for the equipment, and the franchisee collects operating profit from the store and pays McDonald's rent and royalties.\nAnother option is a developmental license (20% of McDonald's restaurants), where the franchisee pays for the building, real estate, and equipment, thereby avoiding rent payments to McDonald's and pocketing a higher percentage of cash flow (although still paying McDonald's royalties).\nFor foreign-affiliated franchisees (which are 25% of McDonald's restaurants), franchisees pay for equipment, the building, and real estate, and McDonald's receives royalties and equity-based earnings depending on its ownership stake.\nThese fees give McDonald's steady free cash flow (FCF), making its results fairly predictable and its capital return program forecast highly accurate. McDonald's also has a very high operating margin because the franchise model is capital-light. That means McDonald's doesn't have to spend a lot of money to make money, and converts a high amount of sales to operating income.\nAs you can see in the chart, McDonald's can afford to boost its dividend because of its high-margin FCF growth.\nAdd it all up, and McDonald's stands out as an ultra-high-quality dividend stock that can serve as a foundational holding in a passive income portfolio."

      "text": "The communications sector is broadly defined these days, encompassing everything from century-old legacy media companies to internet stocks. A communication services stock is a share in a company that facilitates the distribution of information and entertainment on a one-to-many or one-to-one basis.\nInformation technology companies use computers and software to help businesses and individuals stay connected. Telecommunications companies provide the infrastructure and services for distributing information. Television broadcast networks, broadband internet, and mobile wireless networks are also parts of the communications sector.\nAs we grow increasingly connected (and physically apart), the ability to send and receive information over distances becomes increasingly important. The communications sector will continue to produce important and valuable companies.\nBest communications stocks in 2025\nBest communications stocks in 2025\nHere are five of the better stocks that are communicating with investors.\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Dividend yield | Industry |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) | $284 billion | 1.31% | Wireless Telecommunication Services |\n| Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) | $126 billion | 3.75% | Media |\n| Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) | $512 billion | 0.00% | Entertainment |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) | $2.5 trillion | 0.39% | Interactive Media and Services |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | $1.9 trillion | 0.27% | Interactive Media and Services |\n1. T-Mobile\nT-Mobile (TMUS -2.41%) is a leading wireless phone and internet service provider in the U.S. The company found itself in an advantageous position following its acquisition of Sprint in 2020, which provided it with valuable midband radio spectrum.\nThe carrier has deployed that spectrum quickly, building out the biggest 5G network in the U.S., and its coverage is well ahead of that of its biggest competitors. Going forward, T-Mobile should be able to attract customers based on the strength of its brand and service instead of relying on heavy promotions as it did in the previous decade. That's seen in recent financial results, where average revenue per user increased substantially from earlier in the decade.\nT-Mobile also offers home internet service in markets where its mobile network capacity exceeds demand. As part of its merger with Sprint, it committed to covering 90% of rural households with home internet over 5G. That\u2019s a sizable opportunity for the company since most rural areas have limited options for broadband internet. It\u2019s also having success luring urban and suburban customers away from cable internet service.\n2. Comcast\nComcast (CMCSA 1.64%) is the largest cable television and internet service provider in the U.S. While its subscriber base is shrinking for both video and broadband internet, steady price increases and low costs make it very profitable. Its cable network is easy to maintain, and it can upgrade service with low incremental costs.\nIn 2018, the company acquired a majority stake in Sky, a leading pay TV operator in the U.K. and other European countries. It also operates a media company that produces sports, news, and entertainment television for its European audience.\nComcast\u2019s NBCUniversal is one of the biggest media companies in the world. It includes global film and television productions, as well as a broad portfolio of U.S. cable and broadcast television networks. NBCUniversal also operates Peacock, a streaming service that gives it exposure to the direct-to-consumer media market.\nComcast plans to spin off NBCUniversal's cable TV networks, but retain the film and television studios, broadcast networks, theme parks, and streaming service.\nComcast is building a wireless phone business to offset losses in the cable business. So far, it's seen good traction by bundling subscribers, and now counts more than 8.5 million subscribers.\n3. Netflix\nNetflix (NFLX -0.2%) has grown to become one of the most important media companies in the world over the past 15 years. Originally a DVD rental service, it pivoted to streaming video in the late 2000s, distributing licensed content to its subscribers. Now the company spends almost $20 billion annually on both licensed and original content for more than 300 million global subscribers.\nNetflix is a beneficiary of the shift from pay TV to streaming entertainment. As the market leader in the space, it has the capital to invest in more content than its competitors and take more risks with its budget. As a result, it produces some of the best and most popular shows on television.\nThe company cracked down on password sharing and introduced a new ad-supported tier in 2023. The combination led to strong subscriber growth and expanded Netflix's reach. The ad-supported tier opens the door for substantial increases in revenue per subscriber without having to raise prices for consumers.\n4. Alphabet\nThe core of Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%)(GOOGL 3.1%) is Google, which encompasses its namesake leading internet search engine, YouTube, Gmail, Android, and more. Google\u2019s services are used by billions of people around the world, making it integral to how we communicate in modern life.\nGoogle\u2019s business is primarily supported by advertising. Its search engine is able to serve highly targeted ads based on search terms. User data collected from other Google products, such as YouTube, Gmail, and Maps, helps improve its targeting. The sheer number of people using Google\u2019s services makes it extremely attractive to advertisers looking to reach a broad audience, but its targeting capabilities make it suitable for any advertiser.\nGoogle is also the home of Google Cloud, one of the leading cloud computing platforms. It has seen strong adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) services for developers, leading to accelerated growth. The cloud division only became profitable recently and still accounts for a small percentage of Alphabet's overall operating profits, but it's growing fast.\n5. Meta Platforms\nMeta Platforms (META 2.04%) changed the way we connect with friends and acquaintances with Facebook, and it has built Instagram into much more than just a photo-sharing app. It also counts billions of users across its messaging apps -- WhatsApp and Messenger. Meta\u2019s products are the primary way some people communicate with others today.\nThe vast majority of Meta\u2019s revenue comes from digital advertising on Facebook and Instagram. Its trove of user data develops accurate user profiles, and its AI algorithms serve up the right ad at the right time to the right person for maximum effectiveness. As a result, its ads earn a premium price from marketers compared to other social media platforms.\nMeta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence -- not only for its all-important recommendation algorithm, but also for opening the door to new products. Its Meta AI chatbot is one of the most widely used in the world. It's working to develop a product for businesses to use AI agents for customer service and sales on its messaging apps as well.\nAdditionally, Meta is working to develop key technologies and platforms for the metaverse, the next iteration of the internet involving virtual and augmented reality. Besides changing its name to sharpen its focus, the company has also started breaking out results for its Reality Labs segment, which is currently reporting billions in annual operating losses.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg views the metaverse as an extended reality where people can work, play, and stay connected with friends and acquaintances. Owning the primary virtual reality platform for accessing the metaverse could prove extremely beneficial for the digital advertising company.\nWhy invest?\nWhy invest in communication services stocks?\nThe need for communication companies is only growing as we become increasingly distanced. Not only are we more mobile than ever with the ability to quickly move from city to city around the world, but trends like remote work also rely heavily on communication capabilities for enterprises.\nThe sector is incredibly diverse. It ranges from growth stocks with the potential for market-beating returns to value stocks paying lofty dividend yields. There's something for almost any type of investor. The key, however, is making sure you buy companies with strong competitive advantages that they can maintain for the foreseeable future. As communication needs continue to expand, those companies are the ones that stand to benefit.\nAnalyzing these stocks\nHow to analyze communications stocks\nThe communications sector is broad and encompasses many different fields. It\u2019s generally best to compare communications companies that mainly operate in the same industries or that are at similar stages of growth.\n- Compare a company's user base to its competitors. Is it larger or growing faster?\n- Use revenue per user to compare similar businesses as a signal of competitive moats.\n- Dividend yield is an important factor to consider for many communications stocks.\n- Investors should also pay attention to cash flow.\nEach industry within communications has an area of spending that should produce significant returns over time.\n- Telecommunications companies should produce strong returns on their capital expenditures.\n- Information technology companies should produce strong returns on their research and development (R&D) spending.\n- Media companies should produce strong returns on their content expenses.\nRelated investing topics\nLooking forward\nThe communications sector is poised to grow\nThe amount of data moving over long distances is growing every year. Whether it\u2019s a simple text message on a mobile device, a film streamed over the internet, or important classified business communications, internet connectivity and 5G networks will only increase in importance, along with platforms that deliver information. Buying strong companies across the communications sector should produce good returns for investors as this trend continues.\nCommunication Services Stocks FAQ\nAre communication service stocks a good buy now?\nThe communication services sector is broad and diverse. Some individual companies could be good purchases right now; others might not be. Overall, there's a growing need for communication services, and that trend isn't slowing down. Finding individual companies with competitive advantages and strong balance sheets should produce strong returns over the long run.\nWhat are the communication service stocks with highest dividends?\nThe individual companies in the communication sector with the highest dividend is constantly changing. That said, many telecom companies consistently sport high dividends.\nWhy are communication stocks falling?\nCommunication stocks may be falling for any number of reasons. A stock price will decline when investors lower their expectations for future earnings. The specific industry could be facing regulatory pressure or macroeconomic headwinds. Infrastructure costs for providing their service may be rising faster than prices. Or the industry may be facing a structural challenge affecting sales or expenses.\nWhat are the risks of investing in communication stocks?\nCommunication stocks face regulatory and political pressure, which could hurt operations. New technology can make a company's product obsolete if it doesn't adapt with the times. Macroeconomic factors can reduce consumer spending and advertising sales."

      "text": "Energy stocks are important for investors to understand because the energy sector is vital to the global economy. It produces and supplies the fuels and electricity needed to keep the economy humming.\nThe energy industry includes companies involved in the following activities:\nRenewable energy stocks\nRenewable energy stocks\nThese companies manufacture components to produce electricity using renewable resources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. They also include companies that operate and develop renewable energy-generating facilities.\n- Solar energy stocks: This subgroup of renewable energy focuses on manufacturing solar panels and components to generate electricity from the sun.\n- Wind energy stocks: This subgroup focuses on manufacturing wind turbines and blades.\n- Hydrogen stocks: These companies focus on producing hydrogen, a potentially emission-free fuel that could replace some fossil fuels in the energy industry.\nOil and gas stocks\nOil and gas stocks\nThese companies focus on finding, producing, transporting, storing, refining, and exporting fossil fuels.\n- Oil stocks: Oil companies focus on locating, producing, transporting, and refining crude oil.\n- Natural gas stocks: Natural gas companies concentrate on finding, producing, transporting, and exporting natural gas.\n- Liquefied natural gas stocks: Liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies develop and operate facilities to liquefy and export natural gas.\n- Refining stocks: Refining companies process crude oil into refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.\n- Pipeline stocks: Pipeline companies operate pipelines and other infrastructure used to transport, process, store, and export energy products.\nUtility stocks\nUtility stocks\n- Utility stocks: These companies generate power and distribute electricity, natural gas, and water to customers.\n- Electric utility stocks: Electric utility companies generate and distribute electricity to customers.\nThis broad industry is crucial to providing the economy with the energy it needs. It's also an important one for investors to understand.\nBest energy sector stocks to buy in 2025\nBest energy sector stocks to buy in 2025\nHundreds of public companies focus on the production and distribution of energy. However, a few leaders stand out because of their size and financial strength. Here are five of the best energy stocks to consider buying in 2025:\n| COMPANY | TICKER | WHAT IT DOES |\n|---|---|---|\n| Brookfield Renewable | (NYSE:BEP)(NYSE:BEPC) | Globally diversified renewable energy producer. |\n| ConocoPhillips | (NYSE:COP) | Globally diversified oil and natural gas producer. |\n| Chevron | (NYSE:CVX) | Globally diversified and integrated energy company. |\n| NextEra Energy | (NYSE:NEE) | Leading utility and renewable energy producer. |\n| Enbridge | (NYSE:ENB) | Leading pipeline and utility company. |\nHere\u2019s a closer look at some of the best energy stocks in the industry:\n1. Brookfield Renewable\n1. Brookfield Renewable\nBrookfield Renewable (BEP 2.62%)(NYSE:BEPC)is a leading global renewable energy producer. It operates hydroelectric, solar, wind, and energy transition assets. The company sells the power produced by these assets under long-term fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs) to electric utilities and other large power users.\nThe contracts enable Brookfield to generate relatively steady cash flows. It pays out a large portion of that money to investors via an attractive dividend. The company retains the balance to acquire, develop, and expand its renewable energy operations.\nBrookfield Renewable has an enormous backlog of renewable energy development projects. Combined with other growth drivers such as acquisitions and higher power prices, Brookfield expects to increase its funds from operation (FFO) per share by more than 10% annually through 2029. Meanwhile, it has increasingly visible and secured growth through 2034. That should support a 5% to 9% annual dividend growth, making Brookfield an excellent renewable energy dividend stock.\n2. ConocoPhillips\n2. ConocoPhillips\nConocoPhillips (COP 2.11%) is a diversified oil and natural gas producer. It has operations around the world and uses several methods to produce oil and natural gas.\nThe oil company significantly enhanced its position by acquiring Marathon Oil in a $22.5 billion all-stock deal that closed in late 2024. The transaction will add 2 billion barrels of resources to its U.S. onshore portfolio with an average cost of supply below $30 a barrel. The acquisition will be accretive to its earnings, free cash flow, and return of capital, driven in part by the expectation it will capture more than $1 billion of cost and capital synergies within the first year of closing the deal.\nConocoPhillips anticipates returning a significant portion of its growing free cash flow to investors in the coming years. It plans to ramp its share repurchase rate from $5 billion annually to $7 billion, putting it on track to buy back more than $20 billion in shares in the first three years following the Marathon deal. It also pays a growing quarterly dividend. ConocoPhillips boosted its payment by 34% in late 2024. It aims to deliver dividend growth within the top 25% of companies in the S&P 500 in the future.\nCommodities\n3. Chevron\n3. Chevron\nChevron (NYSE:CHX) is a leading global energy company. It boasts a globally integrated oil and gas business that includes exploration and production assets, refining capabilities, and a chemicals business. The company\u2019s large-scale and integrated operations help it weather the volatility in the energy sector.\nChevron uses the cash flows generated from its legacy oil and gas operations to pay a growing dividend, repurchase shares, and invest in the future. Chevron increased its dividend for the 37th straight year in 2024. It also plans to buy back between $10 billion and $20 billion of its stock each year.\nThe company expects to grow its cash flow by more than 10% annually through 2027 (assuming oil averages $60 a barrel), fueled by its high-return capital program. It could significantly exceed that level if it's successful in closing its acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES). The roughly $60 billion deal would enable Chevron to more than double its free cash flow by 2027 (if oil averages $70 a barrel) while extending its production growth outlook into the 2030s.\nChevron is also investing in the lower-carbon fuels the world will require in the future. It's focusing on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and renewable fuels. The balance makes it an ideal choice for investors seeking a way to invest in the energy transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives.\n4. NextEra Energy\n4. NextEra Energy\nNextEra Energy (NEE 0.18%) is one of the country's largest electric utility companies. It's also a global leader in producing power from the wind and sun through its energy resources segment, which sells clean energy to other utilities and end users around the country.\nThese businesses generate relatively stable cash flow. It sells and distributes power backed by government-regulated rates and fixed-price PPAs with customers. The business model is very resilient because businesses and households need a steady supply of power.\nNextEra Energy has one of the best financial profiles in the electric utility sector. It features one of the highest credit ratings in its peer group. NextEra also has a conservative dividend payout ratio for a utility, allowing it to pay a stable and growing dividend. The company expects to increase its payout at a 10% annual rate through 2026, making it an excellent renewable energy dividend stock. Its strong financial profile also allows it to make significant investments in new renewable energy capacity and related infrastructure.\nThese investments help drive the company's expectation that it will grow its adjusted earnings per share at or near the top end of its 6% to 8% per share annual target range through 2027. It boasts strong growth prospects beyond that, powered by the accelerating demand for renewable energy for things like electric vehicles and data centers. These investments should boost its earnings while reducing its emissions, producing a win-win outcome for shareholders and the planet.\nCapital\n5. Enbridge\n5. Enbridge\nEnbridge (ENB 0.02%) is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America. It has four core operating segments:\n- Liquids pipelines: It moves 30% of the oil produced in North America.\n- Gas transmission & midstream: Enbridge transports almost 20% of all the gas consumed in the U.S.\n- Gas distribution: It operates North America's largest natural gas utility by customer count.\n- Renewable energy: Enbridge has a diversified renewable energy platform, including a growing European offshore wind business.\nEnbridge's leading energy infrastructure portfolio generates very stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. It significantly enhanced the stability of its earnings profile in 2024 by acquiring three natural gas utilities from Dominion (D 1.06%) in a $14 billion transformational deal that meaningfully increased its gas distribution business. It now gets about half its earnings from liquids pipelines and the other 50% from lower carbon energy (e.g., gas and renewables).\nThe company distributes 60% to 70% of its steady cash flow to investors via a very attractive dividend. It retains the rest to help finance its continued expansion.\nThe company has a multibillion-dollar backlog of commercially secured expansion projects under construction, giving it lots of visibility into future growth. Enbridge expects its cash flow per share to increase by about 3% per year through 2026 and at a roughly 5% annual rate over the medium term.\nEnbridge's growing cash flow should allow it to continue increasing its dividend. The company delivered its 30th consecutive annual dividend increase at the end of 2024.\nInvesting in the energy sector\nHow to invest in the energy sector\nThe energy sector is a challenging one for investors, especially when it comes to oil and natural gas companies. Energy prices can change in a heartbeat. Volatility can have a massive impact on the sector, as well as on the global economy.\nBecause of the impact commodity price volatility can have on the energy sector, investors need to understand how to invest in energy stocks. That includes keeping risks in mind and not allocating too much of a portfolio to one energy stock or the entire industry. Investors should focus on oil and natural gas companies with the financial and operational strength to survive if industry conditions significantly deteriorate.\nFactors that increase an energy company's durability include:\n- A low-risk business model: For oil and natural gas producers, this means having diversified operations and low production costs. Meanwhile, energy infrastructure companies should have stable revenue with minimal exposure to fluctuations in volumes or pricing, such as operations supported by regulated rates or long-term fixed-fee contracts.\n- A strong financial profile: Balance sheet factors to consider are a high investment-grade credit rating, lots of liquidity (cash on hand and borrowing capacity), and minimal near-term debt maturities. In addition, an energy company should have a conservative dividend payout ratio compared to its peers.\n- Manageable capital spending programs primarily financed with post-dividend free cash flow and prudent use of debt.\nEnergy companies with these characteristics will be in a better position to withstand the inevitable cyclical downturns. That means they will still be around when market conditions improve. They will also have more flexibility than their weaker peers to capture opportunities that can create value for their investors.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nAre energy stocks right for you?\nThe energy sector is vital to the global economy because it provides the fuel and power needed to drive trade and travel. However, when the economy slows, as many fear might happen in 2025, it can have a major impact on energy demand and prices. That can put significant weight on energy stock prices.\nThe best energy stocks to buy are those that can easily survive a downturn and thrive when market conditions improve. Energy stock investors should also consider putting more attention on cleaner energy companies using renewable sources. The world is steadily transitioning to cleaner fuels to ensure we avoid the worst possible impacts of climate change.\nFAQs\nEnergy Stock FAQs\nWhat are the best energy stocks to buy?\nA few leaders stand out because they\u2019re larger in size and have strong financial profiles. Here are a few of the top energy companies to consider:\n- Brookfield Renewable.\n- ConocoPhillips.\n- Chevron.\n- NextEra Energy.\n- Enbridge.\nAre energy stocks risky?\nThe energy sector is vital to the global economy because it provides the fuel and power needed to drive trade and travel. However, when the economy slows, it can have a major impact on energy demand and prices. That can put significant weight on energy stock prices.\nConversely, when the economy hits the accelerator, demand soars and usually takes prices up with it. Investors should focus on the stocks of companies that can easily survive a downturn. In addition, they should consider focusing more attention on clean energy companies using renewable sources.\nWhat are the best utility stocks?\nThe best utility investments are companies with a top-notch financial profile and visible growth prospects. Each of the companies below meets those criteria and has the potential to produce above-average total stock returns -- dividend yield plus stock price appreciation.\nHere is a list of standout companies, followed by our assessment of each investment:\n- American Water Works (NYSE: AWK) is the largest publicly traded water and wastewater utility in the U.S.\n- Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP) owns a diversified portfolio of infrastructure businesses.\n- NextEra Energy operates regulated electric utilities in Florida. It also owns a nonregulated competitive energy business that operates natural gas pipelines and renewable energy projects."

      "text": "Energy is one of the highest-yielding stock-market sectors. Many oil and gas companies pass along a considerable amount of their profits to shareholders through dividends, which can help offset the inherent volatility of energy markets. However, a dividend is only as reliable as the company paying it, so it's best to focus on dividend quality over dividend quantity.\nExxonMobil (XOM 1.72%), Chevron (CVX 1.50%), and Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP -0.44%) are unique in that they offer high dividend yields and reliable payouts. By investing $7,500 into each stock, you can expect to generate at least $1,000 in passive income per year.\nHere's why all three dividend stocks are worth buying now.\nFor passive income, look to the oil patch and pick up shares of ExxonMobil\nScott Levine (ExxonMobil): While it's critical to keep your eyes on the future when evaluating potential stock buys, it's also worthwhile to dig into a company's previous performance. In doing so with ExxonMobil, it's readily apparent that the company has created a culture supportive of consistently rewarding shareholders -- a valuable quality for those looking for a long-term dividend opportunity. For this and other reasons, now's a great time for investors to grease the wheels of their passive-income machines with ExxonMobil and its 3.6% forward-yielding dividend.\nFor 42 consecutive years, ExxonMobil has hiked its dividend higher -- and I'm not talking about nominal increases. From 1982 to 2024, ExxonMobil has boosted its payout at a near 6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Of course, there's no certainty that ExxonMobil will continue to maintain the same cadence with dividend hikes, but the company's strong growth prospects suggest that it's well-positioned to extend the trend of dividend hikes.\nIn 2024, ExxonMobil reported $55 million in cash flow from operations. Management projects that expanding liquid natural gas (LNG) production, as well as oil production from assets in the Permian basin and Guyana, along with a projected $6 billion in cost reductions have the potential to help the company grow operational cash flow by about $30 billion by 2030.\nFor those interested in placing ExxonMobil on their watch lists, it's important to recognize that the company is subject to ups and downs stemming from energy prices, so investors must be comfortable with enduring potential volatility. But with ExxonMobil's five-year average payout ratio of 77.4%, management has proven that it's adept at balancing the company's financial health with rewarding shareholders.\nChevron's upstream portfolio just got a massive jolt\nDaniel Foelber (Chevron): Chevron's acquisition of Hess boosts the integrated oil major's exposure to U.S. onshore assets and gives it a stake in a consortium that's developing Guyana's rich offshore reserves. It's a deal that will significantly boost Chevron's free cash flow and, in turn, provide a runway for earnings and dividend growth and stock repurchases.\nHowever, a lot has changed since Chevron announced its intent to buy Hess in October 2023. Brent crude oil prices (the international benchmark) have fallen from the mid-$90 per-barrel range to the low $70 per-barrel range. Meanwhile, Chevron's stock price has also ticked down despite what's been a rapid run-up in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.52%).\nAs you can see in the following chart, Chevron's earnings have also been falling in lockstep with lower oil prices.\nIf Chevron had been able to acquire Hess in today's market, it might have been able to pay a more attractive price. However, the deal should still pay off in the long run.\nFor starters, Chevron has the balance sheet and free cash flow to make it work. In recent years, it reduced its leverage and ramped up buybacks -- with plenty of cash left over to continue boosting its dividend.\nHess offers Chevron a way to diversify its production portfolio. Like its peer ExxonMobil, Chevron has been growing production in the largest onshore oil and gas field in the U.S. -- the Permian Basin. However, it has also been investing in U.S. offshore production, international production in Kazakhstan, West Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean, and LNG in Australia.\nGuyana has geological conditions and rich reserves that should provide a low development-cost profile, increasing the overall quality of Chevron's portfolio. In fact, ExxonMobil (which holds a 45% stake in the Guyana consortium, compared to a 30% stake for Chevron) has identified Guyana as one of its best long-term assets, along with the Permian Basin and LNG.\nAll told, the Hess deal should help Chevron accelerate its earnings growth without impacting its ability to increase its dividend steadily. Chevron sports a 38-year streak of raising its dividend. The stock yields 4.5% at the time of this writing, which is sizable, relative to the mere 1.2% yield of the S&P 500.\nChevron is also a great value, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.9. However, it's worth understanding that this metric is based on Chevron's trailing-12-month earnings -- which coincided with fairly mediocre oil and gas prices and a challenging refining operating environment. Chevron could look even cheaper if prices recover and it benefits from the added production from Hess.\nAll told, Chevron stands out as a compelling high-yield dividend stock to buy now.\nA high-yield stock favored by current events\nLee Samaha (Cheniere Energy Partners): The recent trade deal between the European Union (E.U.) and the United States included an agreement for the E.U. to acquire $750 billion in energy exports through 2028. That's excellent news for LNG exporters like Cheniere Energy Partners. The company owns and operates liquefaction facilities (where natural gas is converted into LNG) and the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana.\nIts major customers include power companies as far away as India and South Korea, as well as European customers. As such, it's likely to be a key player in an export-led push by the current administration to sell U.S. energy across the globe.\nThe importation of U.S. LNG will facilitate the phasing out or reduction of LNG volumes imported to the E.U. from Russia. Given current geopolitical affairs, this trend is likely to gain momentum.\nIn addition, Cheniere tends to work on long-term counterparty arrangements with fixed fees that produce stable cash flow. Once a customer is on board, they tend to generate a stream of long-term income.\nPutting all these factors together, Cheniere Energy Partners and its 5.8% dividend yield are a good option for investors seeking passive income."

      "text": "The \"Ten Titans\" are the largest growth-focused U.S. companies by market cap -- consisting of Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.56%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOGL 3.10%) (GOOG 2.98%), Meta Platforms, Broadcom (AVGO 1.48%), Tesla, Oracle (ORCL 1.30%), and Netflix.\nCombined, they make up over 37% of the S&P 500, showcasing the top-heavy nature of the index and how just a handful of companies can move the market.\nIf I could only buy and hold half of the Ten Titans through 2030, I'd go with Nvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft, Oracle, and Alphabet. Here's what separates these growth stocks from the rest of the pack.\nThe building blocks of AI\nNvidia and Broadcom both play crucial roles in the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI).\nNvidia's graphics processing units, CUDA software platform, and associated infrastructure provide a full-scale AI ecosystem for data centers. Orders continue to pour in for Nvidia's chips as big tech companies ramp up capital expenditures to support AI models.\nBroadcom makes application-specific integrated circuits, which are AI accelerators that can perform specific functions. The company's latest customer accelerator (XPU) is its 3.5D eXtreme Dimension System in Package, which drastically cuts down on power consumption and boosts efficiency between components -- all within a smaller package size. Broadcom offers compute, memory, network, and packaging capabilities, giving customers a vertically integrated solution for AI at scale.\nBroadcom has a highly differentiated networking and infrastructure software business. In addition to AI accelerators, its semiconductor segment also offers a variety of solutions for enterprise clients, like broadband, wireless, storage, and more.\nThree different ways to bet on cloud computing\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, and Oracle offer three distinctly different ways to invest in cloud computing.\nMicrosoft Azure is the No. 2 cloud player behind Amazon Web Services. Azure is Microsoft's fastest-growing segment -- capitalizing on AI demand through cloud offerings specifically geared toward handling AI workloads. But what separates Microsoft from other cloud plays is the strength of the rest of its business. Copilot for Azure, the Microsoft 365 software suite, and GitHub continue to grow their active user base. Microsoft's revenue growth has accelerated, and profit margins are at their highest level in over a decade -- driving Microsoft's surging stock price.\nAlphabet's Google Cloud doesn't have as much market share as Azure, but it is growing quickly and becoming more profitable. But unlike Microsoft, where cloud is the centerpiece of the investment thesis, Google Cloud doesn't contribute nearly as much to Alphabet's bottom line as other services -- namely Google Search and YouTube.\nAlphabet stock has roared higher in recent months, but it's still arguably the best value of the Ten Titans.\nWhile Google Search could see disruption from rival information resources like ChatGPT, it's worth noting that Google Gemini has gained significant traction in recent quarters -- showing Alphabet's ability to adapt.\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is arguably the most exciting play in cloud computing right now. OCI is thriving due to its flexible structure, which leans on Oracle's established database ecosystem. It is best paired with Oracle databases and applications, with certain services not available on other clouds.\nInstead of going toe-to-toe with the \"big three\" cloud providers, Oracle partners with them by combining its database services with the AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud infrastructure. All told, Oracle is a top play in cloud computing because it offers its own vertically integrated suite of solutions, but also stands to benefit from the overall growth of the industry through its partnerships.\nThese titans are worth their premium price tags\nNvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle have all been phenomenal stocks -- crushing the S&P 500 over the last five years. With the exception of Alphabet, outsized gains have made valuations expensive based on their trailing and forward earnings estimates, which may deter some investors from approaching these names.\nHowever, folks who are looking for top companies to buy and hold through at least 2030 will care more about where a company will be years from now than the next few quarters. The advantage of a longer investment time horizon is that you can give a company time to grow into its valuation. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle are some of the most expensive of the Ten Titans, but they also have the most attractive runways for growth. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Alphabet have more reasonable valuations and multiple levers to pull for growing earnings for years to come.\nThere are valid cases for buying all of the Ten Titans, but Nvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle truly stand out as the best of the best for long-term investors."

      "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/12/buy-chipotle-growth-stock-sell-off-august/",
      "text": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 1.55%) blasted to an all-time high last summer in anticipation of its 50-for-1 stock split. But it's been a mixed bowl since. CEO Brian Niccol announced he would take a similar post at Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) last August. And Chipotle's results haven't been very good since.\nWith the stock down 31.2% year to date, here's why the sell-off in this growth stock could be a buying opportunity for patient investors.\nGrowth has ground to a halt\nChipotle's stock is down 21.5% since the company reported second-quarter 2025 earnings on July 23. There was a lot not to like in the quarter, including just a 3% increase in sales -- because of new store openings -- and a 4% decrease in same-store sales (comps). Operating margins also fell to 18.2% from 19.7% a year ago. Guidance was bleak, forecasting flat full-year comps.\nThese results are nothing like what investors have been used to from the burrito behemoth. Chipotle's stock price, revenue, margins, and earnings soared over the last five years, showcasing management's ability to navigate the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. So investors may be wondering what makes the current climate so much worse.\nThe answer is likely a combination of pressures on consumers to pull back on restaurant spending, as well as fatigue with price increases. A three-legged stool of sales volume, store openings, and price increases has fueled Chipotle's long-term growth.\nWhen everything is working in concert, the results can be amazing. But when consumers resist price increases, and comps suffer -- as we just saw in the latest quarter -- it can throw a wrench into the works.\nBlending customization and convenience\nTo counteract these pressures, Chipotle is leaning into its digital sales and its rewards program. Online sales were 35.5% of total food and beverage revenue in the recent quarter. And 80% of the 315 to 345 stores Chipotle plans to open in 2025 will have a mobile-order pickup lane, or Chipotlane.\nThe company offers more customization and higher quality compared to most fast-food restaurants, but that can also lead to longer wait times, overwhelmed staff, and supply chain challenges. Mobile ordering reduces some of this complexity by eliminating the crucial step of a customer relaying an order to the Chipotle staff and the payment process. That way, the store just has to put together the order and give it to the customer, which can save staff and customers time. A rewards program further incentivizes frequent visits through points and special promotions.\nIt all sounds great on paper. But as Starbucks has found, leaning heavily on mobile orders can backfire and lead to especially complex orders and impatient customers who order in person and then have to wait for the mobile orders to be processed before they get their order fulfilled.\nStarbucks' solution is a 30% reduction in its menu items by the end of fiscal year 2025, as well as the introduction of new items to appeal to a majority of customers' interests rather than niche orders.\nAs Chipotle pushes digital orders, investors should watch to make sure the influx doesn't backfire on staff or sales volumes. But for now, the chain's main focus is on boosting sales volume. It just released its Honey Chicken, which was featured in one out of every four orders in the recent quarter. And the company debuted its first dip in five years with Adobe Ranch.\nAll told, Chipotle is playing the long game by focusing on building a quality menu that will appeal to a wide range of customers and leverage convenience through mobile order and pickup. These initiatives will be especially important over the medium term, as their success could alleviate the need to raise prices.\nThe stock is on the investor value menu\nInvestors who believe in this long-term strategy are getting a compelling opportunity to buy shares on sale. Chipotle has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 37 compared to a five-year median P/E of 56.9. The stock has historically fetched an ultra-premium valuation for a restaurant because of the chain's growth and brand power. But the valuation compression shows investor frustration with the company's recent results.\nChipotle continues to repurchase a ton of stock, including $435.9 million in the recent quarter. It doesn't pay a dividend, but buybacks are an essential way it returns value to shareholders. By reducing the share count, it artificially increased earnings per share -- making the stock a better value. With $838.8 million remaining in share repurchase authorizations by the board of directors, expect the company to continue buybacks in the coming quarters.\nTime to buy the dip on Chipotle stock\nChipotle stock is the cheapest it has been in five years, providing an intriguing opportunity for investors who are willing to look past the near-term slowdown.\nInvesting in phenomenal businesses when they are out of favor for what appear to be temporary reasons can be an excellent opportunity to build long-term wealth. One of the greatest advantages individual investors have over institutions is that they don't have the pressure of performing relative to their peers or clients.\nSo an individual can endure volatility and let a story play out. Or in the case of Chipotle, buy the dip without needing the stock to magically recover overnight."

      "text": "When most people hear the term \"financial sector,\" they think of banks. Although this is certainly the largest part of the financial sector, several other types of companies are included in the sector, as well.\nStocks for beginners\nBest financial stocks for beginners\nThese are some mature, easy-to-understand financial sector businesses that are smart choices for beginner investors:\n- Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.13%) (BRK.B -0.06%) is not always thought of as a financial sector stock. However, it is an insurance company at heart, so it is technically a part of the sector. Led by legendary investor Warren Buffett, Berkshire is the parent company of GEICO and has an enormous reinsurance operation. Investors in the company gain exposure to its massive stock portfolio, which also happens to own large stakes in financial heavyweights Bank of America (BAC 2.55%) and American Express (AXP 3.47%).\n- JPMorgan Chase (JPM 1.55%) is the largest U.S. bank by assets and has an excellent track record throughout a variety of economic environments. It's tough to make a case against JPMorgan Chase as an investment if you want bank stock exposure in your portfolio. The bank consistently posts some of the highest profitability metrics in the industry and has vast operations in both consumer and investment banking.\n- Visa (V 1.64%) operates the world's largest payment network. Along with Mastercard (MA 1.04%), Visa has half of a near-duopoly over the payment processing industry. But don't make the mistake of thinking Visa doesn't have room to grow. The company currently processes about $16 trillion in annualized payment volume per year via about 4.6 billion branded debit and credit cards.\nAs for financial sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH 1.97%) may be an excellent choice if you don't want to choose individual stocks. This index fund gives investors exposure to the entire financial sector for a low 0.1% expense ratio (annual investment cost). The fund provides exposure to hundreds of financial sector stocks, weighted according to their market capitalizations, so more of the fund's assets are invested in the larger financial companies.\nIn addition to the three companies already mentioned, top holdings include Bank of America, Citigroup (C 2.88%), BlackRock (BLK 2.08%), and Wells Fargo (WFC 1.59%).\nTypes of stocks\nTypes of financial stocks\nSeveral different types of companies make up the financial sector. Companies in the financial sector vary widely by function, size, growth potential, and other factors.\nFinancial stocks can be broken into several categories, including:\n- Banks: As previously mentioned, bank stocks make up the bulk of the financial sector. These include commercial banks, such as Wells Fargo, which provide deposit accounts and loans to individuals and businesses. It also includes investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs (GS 3.62%), which provide services to institutions and high-net-worth investors. Some banks, like JPMorgan Chase, serve both commercial and institutional clients.\n- Insurance: The second-largest part of the financial sector is the insurance subsector, which includes property and casualty insurers, life and health insurers, specialty insurers, and insurance brokers. Berkshire Hathaway is the largest company in the insurance subsector, and this also includes pure-play insurers like MetLife (MET 2.84%). In addition, the insurance subsector also includes so-called \"insurtech\" companies, such as Lemonade (LMND 1.03%).\n- Financial services: Some companies provide services related to investing and the public markets without being classified as banks or insurers. The ratings agency S&P Global (SPGI 0.76%) and the futures exchange CME Group (CME -1.46%) are two examples of financial service providers.\n- Mortgage REITs: Companies that own mortgages and other financial real estate instruments, known as mortgage real estate investment trusts (mREITs), are another group in the financial sector.\n- Fintech: Financial technology, or fintech companies, are those that leverage technology to create new solutions for the financial industry. Visa, PayPal Holdings (PYPL 3.48%), and Block (NYSE:SQ) (formerly known as Square) fit into this category.\nRevenue\nAnalyzing investments\nAnalyzing financial sector investments\nInvestors can evaluate financial industry investments by using both standard metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and custom, sector-specific metrics. For the banking and insurance subsectors of the financial industry, there are some particularly important metrics for investors to consider.\nThese metrics are especially useful for analyzing bank stocks:\n- Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA): Two of the most widely used metrics to express bank profitability, ROE and ROA are a company's annualized profits expressed as percentages of shareholders' equity and total assets, respectively. A 10% ROE and a 1% ROA are often considered to be the industry benchmarks.\n- Net interest margin (NIM): Most banks earn the majority of their profits by simply loaning money and charging interest to customers. The difference between the average interest rate a bank receives and the average rate it pays plus certain expenses is known as its net interest margin.\n- Efficiency ratio: A bank's efficiency ratio measures how much money the bank spends to generate revenue. For example, a 60% efficiency ratio means that a bank spends $60 to generate every $100 in revenue. Lower efficiency ratios are better.\n- Net charge-off (NCO) ratio: Calculating this ratio can be useful for comparing asset quality among different institutions. The NCO ratio indicates the annualized percentage of a bank's loans that it ends up writing off as bad debt.\n- Price-to-book (P/B) ratio: When valuing bank stocks, the price-to-book ratio can be just as useful as the P/E ratio. The P/B ratio is a company's stock price divided by its net asset value. The price-to-tangible-book-value (P/TBV) ratio may be even more useful than the P/B ratio because it excludes assets tough to value, such as brand names and goodwill.\nTwo important metrics\nTwo important metrics for analyzing insurance stocks\n- Combined ratio: To compute this ratio, first add (combine) the amount of money an insurance company pays out in claims to the amount of money the company spends on other business expenses. Divide that amount by the amount the insurance company collects as premium income. If an insurer is a profitable underwriter, the result should be less than 100%. A lower combined ratio indicates the insurer is generating greater profit.\n- Investment margin: Insurers aim to profit from underwriting policies. They also can make money by investing the premiums they collect until they use the money to pay any insurance claims. How profitably an insurer invests -- its investment margin -- is important since investment income is often the primary source of profits for an insurance company. Most insurance companies invest in rather safe fixed-income instruments like Treasury securities and corporate bonds.\nRelated investing topics\nInvesting for the long term\nInvesting in the financial sector for the long term\nFinancial stocks -- especially banks -- can be cyclical, meaning they\u2019re vulnerable to losing value during recessions. When unemployment rises, consumers and businesses often struggle to pay their bills, which can lead to large amounts of bad debt for banks. Banks can be especially vulnerable to panics and crises, which have historically occurred about once a decade (including as recently as 2023, when several regional banks failed).\nBe aware of the risks before investing and consider the overall outlook for a financial company (not just one or two metrics) when conducting your analysis. Also, remember that financial sector stocks are best suited as long-term investment vehicles. There are many factors that can influence bank stocks over shorter time periods that are very unpredictable.\nMany factors can influence financial stock prices in the near term, and many of those factors -- such as weak economic conditions or falling interest rates -- have little to do with the strength of the business itself. If you have an investment time horizon of five years or more, then adding some of the best financial sector stocks to your portfolio is likely a wise choice.\nFAQ\nFinancial stock FAQ\nWhat are good financial stocks for beginners?\nThese are just some of the smart choices for beginner investors:\n- Berkshire Hathaway.\n- JPMorgan Chase.\n- Visa.\n- Mastercard.\nAs for financial sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSEMKT:VFH) is among the best.\nWhat are the types of financial stocks?\nFinancial stocks can be broken into several categories, including:\n- Banks: Bank stocks make up the bulk of the financial sector.\n- Insurance: The second-largest part of the financial sector is the insurance subsector, which includes property and casualty insurers, life and health insurers, specialty insurers, and insurance brokers.\n- Financial services: Some companies provide services related to investing and the public markets without being classified as banks or insurers.\n- Mortgage REITs: Companies that own mortgages and other financial real estate instruments.\n- Fintech: Financial technology companies, or fintech, are those that leverage technology to create new solutions for the financial industry.\nAre bank stocks safe?\nBank stocks are near the middle of the risk spectrum. They can be recession-prone and are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, just to name two major risk factors. But like most other types of businesses, the risk associated with bank stocks can vary tremendously between companies."

      "text": "You rely on consumer staples every day. They include daily essentials such as food and beverages, personal care products, and household and home care products.\nPeople buy consumer staples regardless of the state of the economy, and the amount they buy is relatively fixed in good times and bad. In this way, the consumer staples sector behaves much differently than consumer discretionary businesses such as restaurants, hotels, and apparel, or consumer durables, which are long-lasting products such as furniture and electronics.\nConsumer staples companies may not have the highest earnings growth or year-over-year revenue growth because these stocks tend to be large, mature companies, and the categories they compete in are typically developed. Historically, the sector has experienced relatively little disruption, and these stocks make up for modest growth with low price volatility, reliable profits, dividends, and defensive positioning.\nDefinition\nWhat are consumer staples stocks?\nConsumer staples stocks typically sell consumer goods that people use every day. These include everything from groceries, paper products, and cleaning products to over-the-counter health products, tobacco, and cosmetics. They are sometimes called fast-moving consumer goods, and the sector is also referred to as consumer defensive. These are products that are frequently consumed and turn over quickly in stores. They are also defensive because consumers buy them regardless of the state of the economy. Consumer staples are needs rather than wants.\nConsumer staples stocks include both the companies that make these products and the retailers that primarily sell them like supermarkets.\nAdvantages\nAdvantages of consumer staples stocks\nConsumer staples stocks function in a noncyclical manner, meaning they offer investors safety during recessionary climates. Since these companies sell goods such as food and cleaning products that consumers rely on regardless of the state of the economy, they tend to generate solid profits even in weak economies. For instance, a number of consumer staples companies thrived during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic as consumers stocked up on essentials and avoided spending on discretionary purchases such as travel and restaurant meals.\nConsumer staples stocks also tend to be dividend payers, and many of them are even Dividend Kings, having raised their dividend payout every year for 50 years or more. That shows these companies tend to have longevity -- many of the best-known consumer staples stocks have been around for 100 years or longer -- and they're capable of steadily growing profits over a long period of time.\nConsumer staples are noncyclical, meaning they offer investors safety during recessionary climates.\nBecause of their reputation for reliable dividends, consumer staples stocks are often popular with retirees and other investors seeking long-term income and security. Many offer better dividend yields than an S&P 500 ETF, which currently pays a dividend yield of roughly 1.2%.\nBecause consumer staples companies operate in stable sectors and sell products that are always in demand, the biggest ones have been around for a century or more. Their longevity is a reflection of their brand strength, their history of acquiring smaller brands, and their ability to endure a wide range of challenges and economic cycles.\nOne important factor to monitor when looking at a consumer staples company is its ability to pass on cost increases. Although this issue often takes center stage during inflationary periods, it is always an important component of growth. Simple price increases, changing packaging sizes, and production innovation are all vital tactics in the industry. In inflationary periods, costs for ingredients, labor, and distribution often rise faster than a company\u2019s ability to pass on price changes. There can be a period of margin weakness that will likely be temporary for the best-managed consumer staples companies. Price increases also need to be balanced against the risk of consumers trading down to cheaper alternatives.\nBest consumer staples stocks\nBest consumer staples stocks to buy in 2025\nJust as you\u2019re familiar with many consumer staples products, you\u2019ll likely be familiar with many of the top stocks in the sector, such as Procter & Gamble (PG -0.04%), PepsiCo (PEP 0.35%), Philip Morris (PM -1.61%), and Costco Wholesale (COST -1.18%).\n1. Procter & Gamble\n1. Procter & Gamble\nProcter & Gamble is best known for its marquee brands such as Tide, Gillette, and Crest. The household and personal care company is almost 200 years old. A large number of its brands hold the No. 1 or No. 2 market share position in their categories, including paper products, laundry detergent, diapers, and beauty products. P&G is also a Dividend King.\nP&G has recently developed a number of innovative products, including the nontoxic insect repellent Zevo; a dye-free, silicone-free, and sulfate-free version of Head & Shoulders called Head & Shoulders BARE; and Spruce, a weed killer, that cuts of the weed's water supply on contact. Spruce is P&G's first entry into the large lawn care category.\nP&G has performed during an inflationary era since it can pass along price increases to its customers, although its growth has slowed down recently. For fiscal 2025, as of its third-quarter earnings report, the company is targeting 2% organic sales growth and 2% to 4% core earnings per share growth. Given the uncertainty around tariffs and weakening consumer sentiment, that still shows the company's ability to grow in challenging environments.\n2. PepsiCo\n2. PepsiCo\nPepsiCo is much more than its namesake beverage brand. The company also owns Frito-Lay and Quaker, as well as popular drink brands such as Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Its Frito-Lay snack business generates almost as much revenue in North America as its beverages, and that business has been a source of growth while soda sales have slowed in the U.S. and around the world. With its global brands and distribution, Pepsi enjoys many of the same advantages as industry giants P&G and beverage company competitor Coca-Cola (KO -0.81%).\nBecause of its exposure to the restaurant industry, Pepsi is subject to demand in the consumer discretionary channel, but with the help of the strength of its brands, it's been able to capitalize on inflation by raising prices and growing profits. For example, in 2024 organic revenue rose 2%, driving core earnings per share (EPS) up 9%.\nPepsi has also grown through acquisitions. In 2018, it acquired SodaStream, which gave the company a leading position in countertop soda-making. It also bought energy drink maker Rockstar Energy in 2020. Earlier in 2025, it acquired Siete Foods, a maker of grain-free tortillas and Mexican-American foods, and Poppi, a prebiotic soda brand.\nPepsiCo recently became a Dividend King, having raised its quarterly payout for 50 years in a row, which shows that it\u2019s an attractive stock for income investors.\n3. Philip Morris\n3. Philip Morris\nPhilip Morris (PM -1.61%) is one of the three global tobacco giants, but the company has the strongest position of the three. Philip Morris was formed when Altria (MO -0.1%) and Philip Morris split in 2008 with Altria retaining the domestic business, while Philip Morris took the international markets.\nThat's proven to favor Philip Morris as international tobacco markets have been much more resilient than the U.S., where smoking has been steadily declining for decades.\nIn addition to its exposure to more smoking-friendly markets, Philip Morris has also outperformed peers like Altria and British American Tobacco (BTI -1.28%) in next-gen, smoke-free products, which now make up more than 40% of Philip Morris' revenue and a higher percentage of its gross profit.\nThe company has found success in IQOS, its heat-not-burn tobacco sticks, which uses tobacco rather than the e-liquid vapes use, and heats to a temperature where it turns into vapor rather than smoke. As of the end of 2024, there were more than 32 million IQOS users worldwide, and the number was growing. The company launched IQOS in the U.S. March 2025.\nAdditionally, the company's acquisition of Swedish Match in 2023 has paid off, giving it ownership of the popular Zyn oral nicotine pouches, whose shipments jumped 53% to 223.4 million cans in the first quarter of 2025. Philip Morris is also expanding production at its Kentucky Zyn facility and adding a new one in Colorado.\nFinally, Philip Morris offers a reliable dividend yield of 3%.\n4. Costco Wholesale\n4. Costco Wholesale\nCostco Wholesale has been one of the best-performing consumer staples stocks on the market in recent history.\nUnlike the other stocks on the list, Costco doesn't make products for other retailers to sell. Instead, as a retailer of primarily consumer staples, more than half of its sales come from groceries.\nCostco also has many of the components of a consumer staples stock that consumers look for, including a business model built around its reputation for bargain prices on bulk goods. Its membership model adds another layer of resilience since most of its profits come from membership fees. Customers typically renew memberships at a rate around 90%.\nThe retailer continues to open new stores and has been delivering solid comparable sales growth and e-commerce growth.\nCostco also has a track record of rewarding investors with special dividends every three to five years, which makes up for its paltry dividend yield at 0.5%.\nETFs\nBest consumer staples ETFs\nFor investors who prefer exposure to the entire consumer staples sector rather than picking individual stocks, buying shares in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the most sensible option. The chart below shows three consumer staples ETFs:\n| Fund Name | Expense Ratio |\n|---|---|\n| Consumer Staples Select SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT:XLP) | 0.08% |\n| Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEMKT:VDC) | 0.09% |\n| iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEMKT:IYK) | 0.4% |\nAll three ETFs have Procter & Gamble as their No. 1 holding. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola show up in the top six while turning up lower down on two of the three lists. The iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF doesn't include retailers, but the other two ETFs have giants such as Walmart (WMT -1.18%) and Costco making the cut.\nIn addition, all three ETFs own popular consumer staples stocks such as:\nRelated investing topics\nAre consumer staples stocks right for you?\nThe best consumer staples companies tend to have consistently strong organic sales, leading market shares, and attractive dividend yields. Although the industry sees relatively little innovation and growth, consumer staples products tend to be timeless, and these companies are likely to continue to endure.\nConsumer staples companies have an excellent ability to withstand recessions, increase their dividends, and post consistent, incremental growth. All of those characteristics make them good choices for investors looking for reliable, income-producing stocks.\nFAQ\nInvesting in consumer staples stocks FAQ\nIs it a good time to invest in consumer staples stocks?\nIt's impossible to predict the short-term movements of the market, but investors tend to favor consumer staples stocks during times of uncertainty since they generally outperform in weak economies due to their defensive positioning.\nWhat is the average annual return of consumer staples?\nDetermining the average annual return of consumer staples depends on how you define the sector and which stocks you choose. Based on the history of the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP), consumer staples stocks have compounded at a 7% rate with dividends reinvested since 1998.\nShould I have consumer staples in my portfolio?\nWhether you should have consumer staples in your portfolio will depend on your investing style. If you are a risk-averse investor or a retiree looking for reliable dividend income, then investing in consumer staples makes sense.\nIf you're a growth-oriented, risk-seeking investor, you'll probably favor other sectors over consumer staples."

      "text": "Dividend stocks are shares of companies that make regular distributions to their shareholders, usually in the form of cash payments. Dividend stocks can be a useful source of income, but the best dividend stocks can also be an excellent way to build wealth over the long term.\nHowever, not all dividend stocks are great investments, and many investors are unsure how to start their search. With that in mind, here's a list of dividend-paying stocks you might want to consider and some of the most important things to look for in top dividend stocks.\nNine best stocks\nNine best dividend stocks\nThe Dividend Kings list is a great place to find top dividend stocks. Dividend Kings are companies that have paid and raised their base dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.\nThe Dividend Achievers\u2122 list, whose companies boast 10-plus straight years of dividend increases, is a trademarked property owned by the Nasdaq and another great list to research. Both lists include some great stocks to buy, and we have included a few from each in our list below. Here are nine top dividend stocks to consider buying now.\nCompanies 1 - 3\n1. Lowe's\nHome improvement giant Lowe's (LOW 3.1%) may not seem like a very exciting stock. And that's true -- unless you like dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend almost every year since going public in 1961 and has raised the payout by more than 300% over the trailing decade alone.\nInvestors worried about the housing downturn shouldn't fret. When the housing supply is tight, homes are harder to buy, and people tend to spend more to upgrade their existing homes. So, any cyclical weakness in its results will likely return to growth over the long term, even if short-term shifts in consumer spending cause an overall slowdown in renovations.\nWhile consumer expenditures on home improvement projects remain in flux, particularly as concerns about the economy persist, these are durable spending trends over the long run. As consumer spending appetite improves, home upgrades and other projects, from which Lowe's has historically experienced considerable growth, should see an uptick.\nAnother important factor that's good for Lowe's is that the typical U.S. home is between 31 and 60 years old, depending on the state. The next generation of DIYers will spend a lot of money at Lowe's, as will home improvement contractors. It's made professionals a priority, and sales to contractors are growing.\n2. Realty Income\nIf you're looking for a simple way to invest in high-quality real estate for income and growth, Realty Income (O -1.21%) might be the perfect stock. The company owns an array of largely e-commerce-resistant properties, earning strong cash flow from tenants on long-term leases.\nRealty Income is also a Dividend Achiever, with more than three decades of consecutive annual dividend increases every year since going public in 1994 -- and over 55 straight years of paying a dividend every month. Since its founding, Realty has declared 661 consecutive monthly dividends and has habitually increased its dividend for the last 30 consecutive years.\nThis best-of-breed real estate investment trust (REIT) has also taken steps to continue delivering on its dividend-growing ways. In early 2024, it closed the $9.3 billion acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital, which it said would immediately add 2.5% to its adjusted funds from operations (FFO).\n3. Chevron\nFor years, Chevron (CVX 1.5%) has been a big winner for investors and a solid stock to own, especially for dividend investors. It has maintained a steady track record of generating strong cash flows and growing payouts modestly every year for 38 years and counting.\nThe stock price can fluctuate with oil prices, and Chevron has been part of the volatility trend afflicting many oil stocks recently. Still, Chevron has proven a profitable investment for dividend-seekers over the long term.\nIts $53 billion deal to acquire Hess (NYSE:HES) means significantly more low-cost onshore oil in the Permian Basin and some of the cheapest offshore oil currently being produced. However, a legal challenge by competitor ExxonMobil (XOM 1.72%) delayed the deal's closing until recently.\nIn January 2025, the Federal Trade Commission approved a consent order to resolve antitrust issues concerning the deal, satisfying a key closing condition. Arbitration proceedings over the remaining interests off the coast of Guyana then concluded in May 2025. Chevron ultimately prevailed in the arbitration case and announced the completion of its acquisition of Hess in July 2025.\nThe Hess acquisition significantly strengthens Chevron's portfolio, including adding a 30% interest in the highly valuable Stabroek Block in Guyana. Chevron is now focused on integrating Hess's operations, and is aiming to achieve $1 billion in annual run-rate cost synergies by the end of 2025.\nCompanies 4 - 6\n4. Target\nFor years, Target (TGT 1.98%) was more profitable than its peers, posting some of the highest gross margins and operating margins in retail. At the same time, its focus on increasing its e-commerce business and expanding in-store offerings helped stabilize its top line while improving profitability.\nRecent years have been quite tumultuous as Target has worked through some growing pains, dealing with lower-than-expected growth compared to industry peers, slowdowns in consumer spending, and other notable headwinds. However, Target remains profitable with a robust balance of cash on hand.\nIn fiscal 2024, the company reported net earnings of $4.1 billion on net sales of $106.6 billion. At the end of the fiscal year, the company had about $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.\nThat's great news for dividend investors. With dividend growth at 55 years and counting and shares trading for attractive earnings and cash-flow multiples, dividend investors should put Target on their shopping list.\n5. Starbucks\nOver the past four decades, Starbucks (SBUX -0.27%) has established itself as the dominant global brand in coffee beverages. With more than 40,000 global stores and Starbucks-branded ready-to-drink beverages and packaged coffee in hundreds of thousands more locations, nobody sells -- or buys -- more coffee than this company.\nIn 2023, China returned to more normal public commerce, which has been a big boost for the company. China is Starbucks' second-largest market outside the U.S. and its largest international market. Starbucks has counted on that country to become its biggest and most profitable market over the next decade.\nThe company has also cemented partnerships across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East (both through franchise and licensing agreements) as it seeks to open new profitable stores and expand its international segment. However, the company has some challenges to deal with.\nCritics say Starbucks hasn't introduced many exciting new drinks recently, making the menu feel stale and unappealing to customers. Newer coffee chains are gaining popularity, and despite significant expansion in China, Starbucks faces increased competition from local coffee brands, affecting sales in that key market.\nOver the long run, though, its strong brand and power as a buyer have resulted in robust competitive advantages, including cost benefits throughout its operations and pricing power with consumers. Those economic moats and the company's strong digital presence have resulted in a cash cow business.\nWhile business results have softened more recently, this isn't the first challenge the company has faced. It could be an enticing opportunity to invest. Starbucks has increased its dividend yearly for 14 consecutive years.\nIt has also increased annual earnings per share by more than 300% over the last five years alone. Its yield of about 3% at recent prices is on the higher end of its historical range, representing an attractive price to buy company shares.\n6. Brookfield Infrastructure\nSometimes, the best stocks are the ones hidden in plain sight. That's the case with Brookfield Infrastructure (BIPC 3.75%) (BIP 2.13%), which owns water, energy, utility, transportation, and communications infrastructure projects worldwide.\nIts assets generate steady recession- and inflation-resistant cash flow, and Brookfield returns a sizable portion to shareholders. At recent Class C share prices, it claimed a dividend yield of about 4.1%, more than 5% for the limited partner units, and aims to raise the payout by 5% to 9% every year.\nCompanies 7 - 9\n7. Microsoft\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) is one of the most important software companies on the planet. Over the past decade, it has rebuilt its business to focus on recurring subscription-based revenue that keeps its customers connected and the cash flowing. The company has a solid balance sheet with more cash than debt and a very low payout ratio that leaves tons of room to increase the dividend.\nIts 20-year streak of dividend increases is easy to miss. Its yield of less than 1% at recent prices hasn't put it on many dividend investors' radars. But what it hasn't paid in yield, Microsoft has absolutely delivered, with total returns of more than 3,000% since 2009 and dividends accounting for a sizable portion of those total returns.\nLooking forward, Microsoft wants to take a commanding lead in artificial intelligence (AI). With significant investments in and a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, the company is integrating AI features across its suite of productivity and communications platforms and its Windows operating system.\n8. American Express\nFinancial services, such as consumer and business lending, are another place to find a handful of top dividend stocks, and American Express (AXP 3.47%) is one of the best. Although it's not on the list of companies that raise their dividends every year, Amex has a decades-long track record of either raising or maintaining its dividends through every economic environment.\nThe big lesson here: When other banks and lenders have cut or even eliminated their dividends, Amex has proven strong enough to keep the payouts coming for its shareholders. That's a credit to its high-quality lending standards and focus on higher-income credit customers who are less likely to default on their debts during weak economic periods.\nThe bottom line is that Amex appeals to investors who like owning a top financial services company but are also concerned about economic conditions. This is a great stock to buy during broad market downturns and a solid hold for a bull market recovery.\n9. Clearway Energy\nRenewable energy is mostly considered a place for growth investors, but it's also a wonderful opportunity for dividends. Clearway Energy (CWEN.A 1.14%)(CWEN 1.18%) is a perfect example. The company invests in, acquires, and operates renewable energy facilities, selling the power on long-term contracts -- think decades, not years -- to utility companies and large power consumers.\nThe stock witnessed extensive volatility over the last few years due to concerns that rising interest rates and perceived weakening in demand for renewables could affect its business. The market could be pricing in those concerns now, but the flip side is that its dividend yield was around 5.7% as of August 2025.\nWorries about the business are probably significantly overstated. Yes, rising rates and inflation have sent wind and solar into a downturn. These are cyclical industries that ebb and flow. Plus, Clearway's earnings come from long-term power production, and utilities continue to demand more and more clean power.\nManagement is moving forward, too, saying their long-term expectations remain unchanged. With ample opportunity ahead and plenty of access to funding, Clearway expects it can continue to grow profits and increase its payout.\nHighest dividends\nHighest dividend stocks\nWhether it's to generate the income you'll use today or the capital you can reinvest to increase your wealth, there's a good chance you're looking for a big dividend payout. If you're hoping to maximize the number of dividends you earn, here are some suggestions.\nFirst, consider dividend yield above dividend size. The dividend yield is a percentage of the share price you paid for the stock, paid in dividends annually. That's far more relevant than the dollar amount of dividends per share.\nNext, don't make owning high-dividend-yielding stocks your No. 1 priority. Focus first on business quality and a company's ability to maintain and increase the payout. Only then can you know whether a high dividend yield is sustainable.\nDividend investors should focus not on dividend size but on dividend yield.\nHow to invest\nHow to invest in dividend stocks\nThis article hits on a few things to avoid (e.g., focusing too much on a high yield that might be a trap) and the power of dividend growth stocks as some of the best winners. Here are some key things to look for when investing in dividend stocks.\n- Identify dividend stocks that meet your criteria. You may be looking for yield, a history of dividend growth, and so forth.\n- Research the history of earnings growth. Dividend growth is sustainable only if a company's earnings have also steadily grown at a similar or higher rate over time.\n- Consider valuation. While paying a modest premium for a high-quality business can sometimes be justified, overpaying can significantly weigh on long-term returns.\n- Determine position sizing. Consider how much exposure you want to a particular stock, how much income you expect it to generate, and other factors to ensure you buy an appropriate amount.\n- Focus on the long term. Dividend stocks deliver best when bought and held for many years. Having patience and letting exceptional managers run great companies while you just sit back and own them is how you get the best returns from dividend stocks.\nWhat to look for\nWhat to look for in dividend stocks\nIf you're new to dividend investing, it's smart to familiarize yourself with dividend stocks and why they can make excellent investments. Once you have a firm grasp of how dividends work, a few key concepts can help you find excellent dividend stocks for your portfolio.\n- Payout ratio: A stock's payout ratio is the amount of money the company pays per share in dividends divided by its earnings per share. In other words, this tells you the percentage of earnings a stock pays to shareholders. A reasonably low payout ratio (say, 70% or less) is a good sign that the dividend is sustainable.\n- History of increases: It's a very good sign when a company raises its dividend year after year, especially when it can continue to do so during recessions and other tough economic times.\n- Steady revenue and earnings growth: When looking for the best dividend stocks to own for the long term, prioritize stability. Erratic revenue (up one year, down the next) and fluctuating earnings can be signs of trouble.\n- Durable competitive advantages: This is perhaps the most important feature. A durable competitive advantage can take several forms, such as proprietary technology, high barriers to entry, high customer switching costs, or a powerful brand name.\n- Supportable yield: This is last on the list for a reason. A high yield is obviously preferable to a lower one, but only if the other criteria are met first. A high dividend is only as strong as the business that supports it. So, compare dividend yields after ensuring the business is healthy and the payout is stable.\nRelated investing topics\nDividend stocks are long-term investments\nEven the most rock-solid dividend stocks can experience significant volatility over short periods. There are simply too many market forces that can move them up or down over days or weeks, and many have nothing to do with the underlying business itself.\nSo, while the companies above should make great long-term dividend investments, don't worry too much about day-to-day price movements. Instead, focus on finding companies with excellent businesses, stable income streams, and (preferably) strong dividend track records. The long term will take care of itself.\nDividend stocks vs. dividend funds\nDividend stocks and dividend funds are both popular ways to generate income and potentially grow your investments. Dividend funds, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), invest in a portfolio of multiple dividend stocks. Dividend funds offer diversification and professional oversight by investment managers who carefully select the underlying stocks. With a dividend fund, it's important to pay attention to the expense ratio to determine how much of your investment may go towards fees.\nDividend stocks provide the potential for higher returns but also higher risk. It also takes time and effort to carefully research each business so you can understand whether it is a good fit for your portfolio. Depending on your investing style, you might prefer investing in dividend funds for the instant diversification and exposure they provide to a wide range of income stocks vs. putting cash to work in individual businesses. However, both types of investments can offer advantageous returns for a long-term investor with a well-diversified portfolio.\nFAQ\nBest dividend stocks: FAQ\nWhat stocks pay the highest dividend?\nWhile chasing yield can often lead to bad outcomes, some stocks are just built to be yield machines. Two categories known for paying above-average yields are utilities and REITs, or real estate investment trusts. But just as with any other dividend stock, don't assume that the highest-yielding ones are the best. Be sure to evaluate business quality and whether a company's cash flows support a dividend.\nWhat are dividends in stocks?\nDividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders. U.S. companies typically pay dividends quarterly, though some pay less often, and a few even pay monthly.\nDividends are generally paid in cash, but some companies pay in \"scrip,\" which is dividends paid in stock. Note that this is not the same as a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, where a company (or your brokerage) automatically takes your cash dividend and purchases shares for you.\nWhat is considered a good stock dividend?\nIt can vary by sector and even particular industries within a sector, but the most important answer is \"one that can be sustained.\" This is why chasing yield is so dangerous, as a high yield that can't be maintained is no good at all.\nA useful metric for determining a dividend's safety is the dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of a company's earnings that it pays out in dividends. The safest dividends generally have the lowest payout ratios.\nIs it a good idea to buy dividend stocks?\nWhether you're looking for income or just the best possible total returns, chances are good that many dividend stocks can be ideal ways to reach your financial goals. Just remember that yield is often less important than other factors, such as a company's ability to maintain and grow the payout for the long term.\nHow do dividends work?\nA dividend occurs when a company sends money (or stock, though very rarely) to its shareholders. When a company reaches the point that it consistently earns more than management can effectively reinvest, establishing a dividend policy and sending those excess profits back to investors is a smart move.\nDo ETFs pay dividends?\nYes, many ETFs pay dividends. Dividend ETFs hold stocks that pay dividends, and the ETF then distributes those dividends to its investors.\nDoes it matter when you buy a dividend stock?\nWhen you buy dividend stocks, it matters if you purchase them before the ex-dividend date. To receive the next dividend payment, you need to own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date."

      "text": "When it comes to shopping, there are things you need and things that are just nice to have. The consumer discretionary sector is in that second category. It includes goods and services that people spend money on when they have a little extra cash available, such as travel, dining at restaurants, or fashion and jewelry.\nConsumer discretionary stocks refer to the stocks of companies that make money from consumer discretionary goods. They could be manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers.\nUnlike consumer staples companies, which make necessities, consumer discretionary stocks tend to do well when the economy is strong and poorly when times are tough. Keep reading to learn about the consumer discretionary sector and some top stocks to consider.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected the consumer discretionary sector differently than it did the consumer staples sector, which sells necessities.\nOverview\nUnderstanding consumer discretionary stocks\nConsumer discretionary businesses cover several industries, but they all rely on consumers spending money that they don't need to spend. Consumer discretionary companies include:\n- Makers of furniture, appliances, housewares, and other home furnishings\n- Consumer electronics manufacturers\n- Apparel and luxury goods companies\n- Retailers of various kinds, including department stores, home improvement retailers, electronics retailers, home furnishers, and clothing stores\n- Direct-to-consumer retailers that sell goods by catalog, mail, or via e-commerce\n- Hotel, resort, and casino operators\n- Restaurants\n- Cruise operators\nConsumer discretionary stock prices tend to rise and fall with the overall economy, making them cyclical stocks. For example, high interest rates put pressure on consumer spending and cool off the economy, presenting a challenge for consumer discretionary companies (although interest rate cuts can encourage growth).\nFocusing on well-known brands and industry leaders in this sector is generally a formula for success since the best stocks have long been winners for investors. These companies should also be better able to weather a recession and endure a bear market, since they have deeper pockets and brand equity to fall back on.\nTop stocks\nBest consumer discretionary stocks in 2025\nSeveral consumer discretionary companies stand out as being among the best in their industries:\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Industry |\n|---|---|---|\n| Nike (NYSE:NKE) | $116 billion | Textiles, Apparel and Luxury Goods |\n| Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) | $100 billion | Hotels, Restaurants and Leisure |\n| McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) | $224 billion | Hotels, Restaurants and Leisure |\n| TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) | $152 billion | Specialty Retail |\n| Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) | $214 billion | Entertainment |\n1. Nike\n1. Nike\nNike has established a dominant position in athletic footwear and apparel, with over half a century of innovation in creating sportswear that appeals to a broad consumer audience. The strength of Nike's business model stems from its product innovation, marketing strength, use of endorsements, and tying the success of high-profile athletes to the company's products.\nThe company has a long history of outperforming the S&P 500, despite more recent challenges. Long after Michael Jordan left the professional basketball court, Air Jordan shoes remain a mainstay of Nike's business.\nNike's market share of athletic footwear, estimated at around 30%, puts it well ahead of international competitors Adidas (ADDYY 2.96%) and Asics (ASCCF -1.03%). With the global sportswear company working to play a bigger role in fast-growing areas such as China, Nike still has a lot of potential for growth.\nRecently, Nike has struggled with upstart competition, such as On Holding (ONON 4.24%) and Deckers Outdoor's (DECK 4.21%) Hoka brand. The company also seems to have leaned too heavily on digital and direct channels, overlooking its established wholesale relationships with key partners like Foot Locker (FL 2.17%).\nNike has built a strong digital ecosystem around apps such as SNKRS and the Nike Training Club. However, its revenue declined in fiscal 2025 and is expected to do so again in fiscal 2026.\nDespite those challenges, it's hard to bet against a company that has led its industry for so many decades. It may take time for the turnaround strategy under new CEO Elliott Hill to play out, but Nike should recover from its recent woes.\n2. Starbucks\n2. Starbucks\nThe coffee company plays a significant role in how a large part of the world's population begins their day. By introducing the European cafe concept to the U.S., Starbucks tapped into consumers' desire to treat themselves to affordable luxuries, and its premium beverages now have a loyal following worldwide.\nStarbucks has struggled recently as low-priced competitors have taken market share in China, and consumer demand has been weak in the U.S. Additionally, the company seems to be suffering operationally due to a bloated menu and slow service, especially for Mobile Order & Pay customers.\nIn August 2024, the company hired Brian Niccol, who led the turnaround at Chipotle (CMG 1.55%), to be its next CEO. Investors are hopeful that Niccol can bring Starbucks back to steady growth and restore the business to its full potential.\nAs of early 2025, the company had more than 40,000 locations across the globe, and it expects to have 55,000 locations by 2030, indicating no shortage of growth opportunities. Beyond its cafes, the company also has a healthy business selling in-store products, such as bagged coffee and ready-to-drink beverages.\n3. McDonald's\n3. McDonald's\nMcDonald's has come a long way since its heyday in the mid-20th century, and the fast-food colossus has worked hard to keep up with the times. Innovations such as digital menus that automatically change throughout the day, automated kiosks for ordering, online and mobile order capabilities, and delivery options are making McDonald's more accessible than ever.\nAt the same time, the restaurant chain continues to emphasize value, which keeps customers coming back for more. In 2025, it introduced a new McValue menu with a $5 meal deal and a \"Buy One, Add One for $1\" option.\nAlthough it's a restaurant chain, the emphasis on value gives it some elements of a consumer staples company. After all, everybody needs to eat, and getting a cheap and convenient meal at McDonald's is easy.\nThe company also owns much of the real estate that its franchised restaurants occupy. This enables it to collect rent while franchisees do the hard work of running the restaurants.\nEven in the ever-changing restaurant industry, McDonald's has found a way to stay relevant, despite weak sales in recent quarters. Investors also like McDonald's for its consistent dividend payments. It has increased payments to shareholders each year since the mid-1970s, making the company a Dividend King. With a payout ratio of around 60% of earnings, McDonald's can comfortably maintain its dividend.\n4. TJX Companies\n4. TJX Companies\nOff-price retail giant TJX Companies has found success in apparel and home goods with a business model that's not easily replicated online. The parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods obtains discounted brand-name merchandise through close-out sales, manufacturer errors, and order cancellations. It then sells the merchandise at discounts of 20% to 60%.\nThe company's business has generated wide profit margins and solid growth over the years. It plans to expand to at least 7,000 stores globally, up from about 5,100 today.\nTJX is also one of the rare discretionary retailers that delivered solid growth in 2024, helped by its off-price model. Revenue rose 4% to $56.4 billion in 2024, or 6% when adjusted for the extra week in 2023, and earnings per share jumped 10% to $4.26, or 12% when adjusted for the calendar shift, demonstrating the versatility and strength of the company's business model.\n5. Walt Disney\n5. Walt Disney\nThis household name in family entertainment has been a staple of U.S. pop culture for generations. The company's theme parks and animated movies are popular everywhere. Today, the company also owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Hulu, and it acquired a vast array of assets from Fox in a 2019 deal.\nDisney has a number of competitive strengths, including an unrivaled trove of intellectual property and a business model that enables successful movies, such as Frozen, to be spun into multiple business lines, including theme park rides, toys, consumer products, and even live entertainment.\nDisney has restructured its entertainment business to make Disney+ its centerpiece, and its streaming business is finally profitable. Disney stock has underperformed for several years now, but the components are in place for success if it can successfully transition to streaming. The company plans to launch a streaming version of the flagship ESPN network in the fall of 2025, which could unleash significant profit growth.\nRelated investing topics\nPros and cons\nPros and cons of investing in consumer discretionary stocks\nLike any other sector, investing in consumer discretionary stocks has its pros and cons.\nPros:\n- Made up of brands that are familiar to most investors.\n- Can be big winners over time.\n- Easy to assess their performance.\n- Tend to do well in bull markets.\n- Competitive advantage can be identified by brand strength.\nCons:\n- Among the first businesses to get hit in a recession.\n- At risk of black-swan events like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- Competition tends to be high.\n- Inflation is a risk.\nFAQ\nFAQ: Consumer discretionary stocks\nWhat stocks are considered consumer discretionary?\nConsumer discretionary stocks are stocks of companies that sell goods and services consumers want but don't need. This includes travel, entertainment, apparel, electronics, and furniture, among other categories.\nWhat are the risks of investing in consumer discretionary stocks?\nThe biggest risk of investing in consumer discretionary stocks is that they are generally among the first stocks to be hit by a recession, as they typically rely on consumers' discretionary income. When consumers cut back on spending, they tend to pull back on discretionary goods first.\nWhen do consumer discretionary stocks perform well?\nConsumer discretionary stocks tend to perform well in bull markets and expanding economies, particularly when consumer confidence is high.\nIs Tesla a consumer discretionary stock?\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is considered a consumer discretionary stock, but it can also be classified as an industrial stock. Cars are a discretionary good, so the company has exposure to the same factors that other consumer discretionary stocks do.\nWhat ETF is consumer discretionary?\nOne well-known consumer discretionary exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLY), whose top three holdings include Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla, and Home Depot (NYSE: HD)."

      "text": "The technology sector is vast, comprising gadget makers, software developers, wireless providers, streaming services, semiconductor companies, and cloud computing providers, to name just a few. Any company that sells a product or service heavily infused with technology likely belongs to the tech sector.\nWhat are tech stocks?\nWhat are tech stocks?\nHardware Companies\nThese design and build devices such as:\n- Personal computers\n- Networking servers\n- Semiconductors\n- Smartphones\n- Fitness trackers\n- Smart speakers\n- Enterprise equipment, such as servers and networking gear\nSoftware Companies\nThese design the software that runs on hardware, such as:\n- Operating systems\n- Databases\n- Cybersecurity software\n- Productivity software\n- Cloud computing providers\n- Artificial intelligence (AI)\nSoftware companies are increasingly moving to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model in which customers buy a subscription to a program instead of a one-time license. The arrangement generates recurring revenue for the software company.\nSemiconductor chips largely power the hardware. Semiconductor companies design and/or manufacture central processing units, graphics processing units (GPUs), memory chips, and a wide variety of other chips that help to run today's devices.\nTelecom companies that provide wireless services support the tech sector, but actually belong to the communications sector; so do the video streaming companies that provide easy access to high-quality content, and the cloud computing providers that power those streaming services.\nOur list of stocks\nThe best tech stocks in 2025\nMany of the most valuable companies in the world are technology companies. Here are three of the most dominant and largest tech stocks that investors should consider:\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) is a dominant software company known for its Windows PC operating system and Office productivity software. Microsoft is also the second-largest provider of cloud infrastructure.\nApple (AAPL 1.21%) makes the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. Intense customer loyalty ensures plenty of repeat customers, and a growing array of services makes Apple's ecosystem sticky.\nNvidia (NVDA 1.65%) is the premier manufacturer of semiconductors and advanced GPUs critical for not only gaming, but also for AI applications.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are not technically tech stocks, despite often being lumped in with them.\nThese stocks actually belong to the communications (Meta and Alphabet) and consumer discretionary sectors (Amazon), despite their tech-heavy products and services.\nThe current market\nTech stocks in the current market\nTechnology stocks, as tracked by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK 1.33%), which follows S&P 500 technology stocks, have strongly outperformed over the past five years.\nWhile market conditions had favored high-beta assets like tech stocks, which enjoyed magnified returns in the generally bullish market environment, the market turned bearish in early 2025. Through the first two months of the year, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 dipped 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.\nSeveral macroeconomic factors have contributed to this underperformance. Inflation appears to be cooling, but consumer spending waned at the start of 2025, a sign that many interpret as a harbinger of a market downturn.\nDuring times like these, growth stocks, including technology companies, become less appealing to investors, who instead turn to more conservative options such as stocks in the utilities and consumer staples sectors.\nDespite the recent underperformance of the tech sector, the market remains keenly focused on tech stocks that have a focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Multiple companies have committed to accelerating their AI spend or are in the process of commercializing more AI products. Here are a few highlights:\n- Nvidia: Nvidia has seen massive increases in quarterly revenue, largely driven by data center revenue for generative AI training and inference. In the fourth quarter of 2025, for example, Nvidia reported record quarterly data center revenue of $35.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of 93%. Nvidia's GPUs are at the forefront of the AI revolution, making it a key player in the tech sector.\n- Microsoft: Microsoft has reported double-digit growth in revenue, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (EPS). This growth is largely attributed to the integration and use of AI in its products, such as Copilot which is driving stronger AI integration and increased usage of Microsoft Cloud, including Azure and Intelligent Cloud. Microsoft returned $9.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n- Apple: In February 2025, Apple announced its plan to spend $500 billion developing projects located in the United States over the next four years, including development of an advanced manufacturing facility in Houston. Expected to open in 2026, the Houston facility will produce servers that support the company's AI initiative, Apple Intelligence.\nRelated investing topics\nAnalyzing tech stocks\nHow to analyze tech stocks\nFor mature tech companies that produce profits, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric. Divide stock price by per-share earnings, and you get a multiple that tells you how highly the market values the company's current earnings. The higher the multiple, the more value the market is placing on future earnings growth.\nMany tech companies aren't profitable, so the price-to-earnings ratio isn't a good metric to evaluate them. Revenue growth matters more for younger companies. If you're investing in something unproven, you want to make sure it has solid growth prospects.\nFor unprofitable tech companies, it's also important that the bottom line be moving from losses toward profits. As a company grows, it should become more efficient, especially when it comes to the sales and marketing spending necessary to close deals. If it's not, or if spending is growing as a percentage of revenue, that could indicate something is wrong.\nUltimately, a good tech stock is one that trades at a reasonable valuation, given its growth prospects. Accurately figuring out those growth prospects is the hard part. If you expect earnings to skyrocket in the coming years, paying a premium for the stock can make sense. But if you're wrong about those growth prospects, your investment may not work out.\nInvesting in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on tech stocks is one way to avoid making mistakes. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM 1.75%) is a comprehensive option at a 0.41% expense ratio.\nInvesting in tech stocks can be risky, but you can reduce your risk by investing only when you feel confident their growth prospects justify their valuations."

      "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.89%) contains 30 industry-leading companies that act as representatives of the broader stock market. The Dow has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the addition of growth stocks such as Salesforce in 2020 and Amazon and Nvidia in 2024. However, the index remains a great starting point for finding top dividend stocks.\nHere's why these Fool.com contributors think Honeywell International (HON 2.43%) of the industrial sector, financial sector representative American Express (AXP 3.47%), and consumer staples stalwart Coca-Cola (KO -0.81%) are three great dividend stocks to buy now, even though they are hovering around all-time highs.\nHoneywell's breakup will create value for investors\nLee Samaha (Honeywell): Despite the recent sell-off of the industrial stock, it remains close to its all-time high price.\nThe investment case for this Dow Jones member currently revolves around its impending breakup and the amount of value that can be released in its constituent parts as they trade as stand-alone companies.\nIt's a breakup with an understandable rationale. For example, aerospace companies (Honeywell Aerospace will be the largest of the three new companies) are traditionally valued differently from industrial companies to reflect the long-cycle nature of their business.\nHoneywell Automation (set to be the remaining company) combines building automation and industrial automation, and its separation is part of a trend of industrial companies becoming more focused as automation becomes more software-driven by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization technologies. It's a trend followed by peers like Emerson Electric, Siemens, and Johnson Controls.\nFinally, the advanced materials business (Solstice Advanced Materials) will offer investors an opportunity to invest in a pure-play sustainable materials business.\nAs you can see from this short description, they are significantly different businesses. When separated into three more focused and agile companies with their own capital raising dynamics and sets of investors behind them, they will have an opportunity to release value for investors.\nAmerican Express remains a good value for long-term investors\nDaniel Foelber (American Express): The financial services company is knocking on the door of an all-time high for all the right reasons. American Express continues to deliver excellent results despite pressures on consumer spending by catering to affluent customers.\nAmerican Express charges relatively high fees for its top credit cards, but it makes those fees worth it by offering cardholders attractive perks -- such as high baseline cash back rates and a variety of reward redemption options.\nUnlike Visa and Mastercard, American Express is both a payment processor and a card issuer. Its revenue stream is diverse, consisting of card fees, as well as transaction fees related to card usage frequency and volume.\nIt's a near-perfect business model -- as long as American Express customers pay off their loans. In its latest quarter (second quarter of 2025), American Express reported a 2% net write-off rate. It defines net write-off as a principal loss from a consumer or small business card member, net of what American Express was able to recover (interest not included). Net write-offs are also known as net charge-offs.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, net charge-off rates on credit card banks at all commercial banks for the first quarter of 2025 were 4.44%. This means that American Express does an exceptional job of managing risk and limiting steep losses from customers not paying their loans.\nAmerican Express is similar to an insurance company that has a track record of above-average underwriting -- like those owned by Berkshire Hathaway (American Express also happens to be one of Berkshire's largest holdings). In other words, the risk American Express is taking is of high quality relative to the industry -- which makes investing in the company more appealing.\nOver the last three years, American Express stock has soared 130.3% compared to 43.2% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth. So the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be -- with a 21.8 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 17.2 10-year median P/E. However, American Express is arguably worth the premium price due to the strength of its underlying business model and clear path toward future earnings growth.\nPut some pop in your passive income stream with Coca-Cola\nScott Levine (Coca-Cola): Although shares of Coca-Cola have trended lower over the past few weeks, it was only a few months ago that shares had been their most effervescent.\nOn April 22, Coca-Cola stock bubbled up to uncharted territory when it climbed to an intraday high of $74.38 and ultimately closed at $73.90. Since then, shares have retreated from that level, falling about 6% as of this writing. Nonetheless, shares are hardly sporting a frothy valuation, and investors looking to quench their thirst for passive income would be wise to consider Coca-Cola stock along with its forward-yielding 2.9% dividend.\nThose who only know Coca-Cola for the legendary namesake soft drink may be surprised to learn that the company has consistently acquired a variety of brands over the years. From its acquisition of Minute Maid, a popular juice brand, to gaining a well-known iced tea brand with the acquisition of Honest Tea, to picking up a recognizable milk name in its acquisition of Fairlife, Coca-Cola has diversified its portfolio considerably over the decades. As lifestyle trends shift toward consumers adopting healthier habits, Coca-Cola is well-positioned to prosper from its robust portfolio of consumer beverage brands.\nIn addition to owning the title of the world's largest beverage company, Coca-Cola wears the crown of Dividend King, having consistently hiked its distribution for 63 consecutive years. While it's not a guarantee that the company will rack up another six decades of dividend hikes, it's certainly an auspicious sign that management is committed to rewarding shareholders.\nA cursory glance at Coca-Cola's valuation suggests that today's not a great time to click the buy button. Shares are trading a 21.7 times operating cash flow. Dig a little deeper, however, and investors will find that the valuation is actually a discount to the stock's five-year average cash flow multiple of 22.6. As an industry leader with a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders, Coca-Cola stock is a great option now."

      "text": "Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 0.13%) have made some investors much richer. Over the last decade, for example, Eli Lilly stock averaged annual gains of 25.1%, enough to turn a $10,000 investment into a stake worth $94,204. (The S&P 500 index averaged a still-respectable 12.7% over the same period, turning $10,000 into $33,117.) Had you reinvested your Lilly dividends into more shares of stock along the way, your average gain would have been 26.9%, and your investment's value $108,082.\nIf you're not an Eli Lilly shareholder, you might be wondering whether you should become one. Well, there's certainly a solid green flag or two. Unfortunately, there's a red flag, too.\nA key reason to buy into Eli Lilly is its solid portfolio of drugs and drugs in development. It's already a leader in the increasingly popular realm of weight loss drugs -- with weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro -- and its cancer drug Verzenio is very promising, too. And those are just some of its drugs. My colleague Keith Speights has suggested that Lilly might become the first healthcare company to cross the $1 trillion mark in market value.\nOf course, not every drug will become a best-seller -- and some never even get approved. Eli Lilly reported some disappointing results for its weight loss drug orforglipron recently, which sent its shares downward -- even though patients taking it did lose significant weight.\nSo what's the red flag? Well, it's Eli Lilly's valuation. With a recent price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 61, well above its five-year average of 50, the stock seems a bit richly priced -- though not wildly overpriced. You could still load up on it if you're a long-term investor, or you could buy into the stock gradually over time. Note, too, that President Trump's threatened tariffs could hurt pharmaceutical companies in general."

      "text": "Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%) (GOOGL 3.10%) was so undervalued that it was the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that was cheaper than the S&P 500 in terms of the forward price-to-earnings ratio. But then, Alphabet shot up 15.2% in the month leading up to its second-quarter earnings report.\nStocks that run up into an earnings print will often give up some of those gains unless the report was exceptional. But Alphabet continued to climb higher after it reported earnings on July 23 -- a sign that Wall Street liked what it saw.\nHowever, it's best not to take the market's reaction for granted. Here's where Alphabet stands, where it could be headed, and if the growth stock is a buy now.\nGoogle Search and Gemini are holding their own\nThe primary reason Alphabet has been undervalued relative to other mega-cap growth stocks is a lack of conviction that its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) will yield sufficient returns to offset the potential decline in its existing core segments.\nAlphabet has numerous moving parts, including Google Search, YouTube, Google Maps and Waze, Android, devices such as Pixel and Chromebook, Gmail and Google Workspace, Google Cloud, and \"Other Bets\" like Waymo. Despite a diversified lineup, the weight of Alphabet's success is still carried on the shoulders of Google Search.\nIn Alphabet's latest quarter, the company booked $96.43 billion in revenue, a 14% increase year over year (YOY). Google Search revenue came in at $54.19 billion -- an 11.7% increase YOY. Google Search is not declining; it is growing nicely and remains an integral part of the broader business despite worries that rival search and chatbot platforms would be eating into its market share.\nThe misconception that Alphabet is lagging behind AI may finally be changing. Not only are Google Search and the rest of Alphabet's services doing well, but Alphabet's AI investments are producing impressive results.\nGemini, the company's Chatbot, is powered by Google DeepMind. Gemini is multimodal, meaning it can process text, images, video, audio, and code. Gemini has 450 million monthly active users -- a 50% increase from the first quarter. For context, reports indicate that OpenAI's ChatGPT reached 800 million weekly active users in July.\nAlphabet's ecosystem has been expanding in the image-to-video market. On the second-quarter earnings call, Alphabet said that Veo 3, its video generation model, has produced over 70 million videos since May.\nAlphabet AI tools have free, basic versions, and more advanced subscription services that can be bundled with other offerings in Google One on a single customer and enterprise scale. So, investors should closely watch how Alphabet continues to monetize these tools and determine if they have the potential to eventually contribute to the company's bottom line.\nGoogle Cloud is thriving\nGoogle Cloud remains a distant third behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. But it's still a value-adding piece in Alphabet's portfolio.\nGoogle Cloud revenue jumped 32% in the recent quarter as Alphabet rolled out a flurry of AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for customers. In the past, Alphabet's advertising, subscription platforms, and devices have acted as cash cows and were used to fund Google Cloud and Other Bets. But Google Cloud's profitability has been improving despite aggressive investment.\nIn the recent quarter, Google Services generated a 40.1% operating margin while Google Cloud had a 20.8% operating margin, which is a lot higher than the 11.3% operating margin in the second quarter of 2024. Alphabet is proving that it can keep expanding Google Cloud since it is the company's fastest-growing segment by revenue, while also allowing Google Cloud to continue to the bottom line.\nAlphabet is so optimistic about the success of its AI endeavors and cloud that it is boosting its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) budget to $85 billion. Alphabet's second-quarter capex was $22.4 billion, and around two-thirds of that capex was invested in servers, and one-third went to data centers and networking equipment.\nAlphabet is far from a stalwart that is past its prime. The success is reflected in Alphabet's results and its investments in technical infrastructure. Alphabet can afford to ramp spending without compromising its balance sheet or profitability.\nAlphabet is still a great value\nAlphabet isn't as dirt cheap as it used to be, but the stock is still undervalued because its earnings continue to grow fast enough to keep a lid on its valuation. Over the last three years, Alphabet's stock price has roughly doubled, but earnings have also soared 86.5%. So given the solid earnings growth, Alphabet's price-to-earnings ratio remains compressed at just 20.6 -- a discount to its 10-year median of 28.6.\nWhen I look at Alphabet, I see a company that is showing measurable progress in AI, spending that is paying off, resilience in its legacy cash cows like Google Search and YouTube, and growth in cloud computing.\nAll told, Alphabet checks all the boxes of a foundational growth stock to buy now."

      "text": "Everybody needs healthcare -- or will, at some point. And, when there\u2019s something everyone needs, there\u2019s a huge opportunity for investors.\nAbout $9.8 trillion is spent on healthcare globally. Half of that amount -- around $4.9 trillion -- is spent in the U.S. With the healthcare sector growing significantly faster than the overall economy, the numbers will almost certainly be much larger by the end of the decade.\nHow can investors profit from this growth? Here\u2019s what you need to know about investing in healthcare stocks.\nTypes of healthcare stocks\nDifferent types of healthcare stocks\nThe healthcare sector is so broad that there are several different kinds of healthcare stocks. Four of the most important types are:\n- Drug stocks: Drugmakers focus on developing drugs that treat or prevent diseases. Biotech companies use live organisms such as bacteria or enzymes to develop drugs, while pharmaceutical companies use chemicals. Drug stocks range from huge companies with billions of dollars in sales each year to small biotech firms with no products on the market yet.\n- Medical device stocks: Medical device companies make devices used to care for patients. The devices range from disposable gloves and thermometers to artificial heart valves and robotic surgical systems. Medical device stocks include many health tech stocks, as well as medical equipment stocks.\n- Payer stocks: Payers, including health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), play an especially important role in the U.S. healthcare system. Insurers charge premiums to individuals and employers to pay for healthcare costs, while PBMs administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans.\n- Healthcare provider stocks: Healthcare providers stand at the front lines, delivering healthcare services to patients. They include hospitals, physician practices, home health companies, and long-term care facilities.\nTop healthcare stocks\nTop healthcare stocks to buy in 2025\nStrong companies can be found within each type of healthcare stock. We\u2019ll break down at least one example of each with a look at Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.45%), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.22%), TransMedics Group (TMDX 0.67%), UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.24%), and HCA Healthcare (HCA 0.15%).\n- Vertex Pharmaceuticals stands out as one of the top biotech stocks on the market. The company primarily focuses on developing drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic disease that damages the lungs and other organs. Vertex has also expanded beyond CF with gene-editing therapy Casgevy (a one-time treatment for the rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia) and acute pain therapy suzetregine.\n- Intuitive Surgical is a great example of a medical device stock that also falls into the category of surgical stocks. The company\u2019s Da Vinci robotic surgical system has been used in more than 16 million procedures since its 1999 introduction. Intuitive Surgical also markets Ion, a robotic system for minimally invasive peripheral lung biopsy. Over the long run, the company should have tremendous growth opportunities ahead with an aging population requiring the types of surgical procedures for which Da Vinci is frequently used.\n- TransMedics Group developed and sells the Organ Care System (OCS), a system for transporting lungs, hearts, and livers intended for transplantation. OCS replicates the human body in many ways, keeping donated organs alive until they can be transplanted. TransMedics also created a National OCS Program (NOP) that provides end-to-end services related to organ transplantation, including air transportation. The company has a major growth opportunity in disrupting the organ transplant market.\n- UnitedHealth Group ranks as the largest commercial health insurer in the U.S. It also operates one of the biggest PBMs and is a leader in healthcare delivery services. The company\u2019s size, stability, and dividend make UnitedHealth Group one of the most attractive payer stocks on the market. UnitedHealth Group has also expanded its presence in the healthcare provider market with its 2023 acquisition of home health services provider LHC Group.\n- HCA Healthcare owns and operates 187 hospitals and around 2,400 outpatient facilities including surgery centers, physician clinics, freestanding emergency rooms, and urgent care centers. It's the largest health system operator in the U.S. HCA also operates healthcare facilities in the United Kingdom. The company continues to grow, in large part, by making acquisitions.\nWhat to look for\nWhat to look for in healthcare stocks\nHow do you find the absolute best healthcare stocks to buy? There are four key things to look for:\n1. Growth prospects\nThe most important thing you\u2019ll want to check out with any healthcare stock is the company\u2019s growth prospects. Determine how quickly revenue has grown in recent years. The future doesn\u2019t always mirror the past. However, if a company hasn\u2019t been able to deliver strong revenue growth so far, it probably won\u2019t in the future.\nRead the investor presentations on companies\u2019 websites to learn their strategies for growth and the size of their potential markets. Check out the companies\u2019 rivals to see if their strategies seem to be as good or better. Note that companies will often mention specific competitors by name in their 10-K annual regulatory filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nDon\u2019t overlook the possibility that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) could boost a company\u2019s growth prospects. Companies that have grown through M&A in the past could be looking for new deals to make in the future.\nKeep in mind that deals don't necessarily include an outright purchase of another company. Larger companies sometimes collaborate with smaller players instead of buying them. For example, Vertex Pharmaceuticals teamed up with small biotech CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP 2.82%). The two companies won U.S. regulatory approvals for gene-editing therapy Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease in December 2023 and for treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in January 2024. They're also working together to develop therapies targeting type 1 diabetes.\n2. Financial strength\nThe SEC filings also include statements that can help evaluate the financial strength of a company. Ideally, a company will already be profitable. If it isn\u2019t, make sure you learn how it plans to achieve profitability and how quickly it expects to do so.\nA company\u2019s cash position includes cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. It can be found on the balance sheet (a financial statement that lists all the company\u2019s assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity) in the company's annual and quarterly regulatory filings. Think about cash position the same way you\u2019d think about the amount of money in your checking, savings, and retirement accounts: The more, the better.\nAnother important gauge of financial strength is the free cash flow (FCF) generated by a company. FCF is the cash left over after operating expenses and capital expenditures (which includes money spent on buildings, equipment, and land). As with the cash position, the higher a company\u2019s FCF, the stronger its financial position.\nYour dollars and mine, our capital, is helping shape the world.David Gardner, co-founder, The Motley Fool\n3. Valuation\nYou\u2019d want to know how much a new car is worth before buying it. Determining the value of a healthcare stock before buying it is also important so you can make sure you\u2019re paying a fair price.\nThere are quite a few valuation metrics. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the most popular and measures the price of a stock in relation to its earnings per share, or what you get in earnings for every dollar you invest.\nSome P/E ratios are backward-looking, or reflecting earnings from a previous period (typically the past 12 months). Forward P/E ratios, which use earnings estimates for one year into the future, can be more helpful in assessing the valuation of fast-growing healthcare stocks. Comparing P/E ratios with other stocks in the same industry will help you determine if the stock is relatively cheap or relatively expensive.\nJust because a stock\u2019s P/E ratio is higher than those of its peers doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good or bad buy. It could indicate that the company\u2019s growth prospects are much better than those of its rivals. Be sure to also check out the stock\u2019s price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which incorporates projected earnings growth rates (typically over five years). Stocks with lower PEG ratios (especially when the ratios are less than 1) are more attractively valued than those with higher PEG ratios.\n4. Dividends\nSome of the best healthcare stocks pay dividends -- a portion of earnings that the company returns to shareholders. Dividends can boost the overall return you receive from owning a stock.\nThe dividend yield tells you how large a stock\u2019s annual dividend payments are as a percentage of the current share price. Consider the stock\u2019s payout ratio, which measures dividends as a percentage of earnings and indicates how much of the company\u2019s cash is being used to cover the dividend. The lower the payout ratio, the greater the likelihood that the company will be able to keep paying dividends in the future.\nRisks\nWhat are the risks of investing in healthcare stocks?\nInvesting in any kind of stock comes with risks, including the possibility that competitors will develop more successful products and services. Healthcare stocks face these risks, as well as others that are more unique to the sector.\nHealthcare is highly regulated. Drugmakers and medical device makers can fail to secure the necessary regulatory approvals to market new products. Regulatory changes can drastically alter a healthcare stock\u2019s growth prospects. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the regulation of drugs and medical devices. It\u2019s smart to pay attention to any FDA action related to medical stocks you\u2019re watching.\nMany healthcare stocks also face significant litigation risk. For example, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device makers, and healthcare providers can be sued if patients think the companies\u2019 products and services have caused them harm.\nIn addition, drugmakers and medical device makers must convince payers, including health insurers, PBMs, and government agencies, to buy their products. If companies aren\u2019t successful in obtaining reimbursement approvals, their growth prospects can be reduced.\nMany healthcare companies are also highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement levels. Recent changes to Medicare allow the program to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs with pharmaceutical companies. Some drugmakers' revenues and profits could be negatively affected as Medicare pays less for certain drugs.\nRelated investing topics\nBottom line\nHealthcare stocks should have healthy returns\nDespite these risks, the overall outlook for healthcare stocks appears very good over the long term. Aging demographic trends around the world, combined with advances in technology, should open up tremendous opportunities for healthcare stocks -- and provide healthy returns for patient investors.\nFAQs\nFAQs\nWhat are the best healthcare stocks to buy now?\nMany healthcare stocks are good alternatives for investors to buy now. Some top candidates representing various areas of the healthcare sector include Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Intuitive Surgical, TransMedics Group, UnitedHealth Group, and HCA Healthcare.\nIs it smart to invest in healthcare?\nWhile investors must decide for themselves whether any sector is a good fit for them, healthcare could be a smart area in which to invest for many. Healthcare spending is growing faster than the U.S. GDP as the population ages. This should create significant opportunities for innovative healthcare companies.\nDo healthcare stocks do well in a recession?\nMany healthcare stocks perform relatively well during a recession. Healthcare products and services are usually needed regardless of economic conditions. However, some healthcare stocks might be more affected by recessions than others."

      "text": "The industrials sector is the backbone of the economy. It performs three main functions:\n- Manufacturing and distributing capital goods: This includes building products and machinery, as well as providing construction and engineering services.\n- Providing commercial and professional services: This includes environmental and facility services, along with human resources and employment services.\n- Providing transportation services: This includes operating an airline or railway.\nWhat are industrial stocks?\nWhat are industrial stocks?\nIndustrial companies operate in several subsectors of the economy, providing products and services related to:\n- Aerospace and defense\n- Air freight and logistics\n- Commercial and professional services and supplies\n- Industrial machinery and electrical equipment\n- Construction equipment and building supplies\n- Transportation, including cars, airlines, and railways\n- Waste management\nThe industrial industry is one of three economic segments. It's also known as the secondary sector. The other two economic segments are the primary sector, encompassing agriculture, fishing, and mining, and the service sector, which includes hospitality, consultancy, and nursing.\nBest industrial stocks\nBest industrial stocks to buy in 2025\nThese industrial stocks are some of the sector\u2019s most durable long-term investments:\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Dividend yield | Industry |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Waste Management (NYSE:WM) | $91 billion | 1.39% | Commercial Services and Supplies |\n| FedEx (NYSE:FDX) | $56 billion | 2.36% | Air Freight and Logistics |\n| Ge Vernova (NYSE:GEV) | $165 billion | 0.08% | Electrical Equipment |\n| Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) | $104 billion | 2.92% | Aerospace and Defense |\n| Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) | $204 billion | 1.32% | Machinery |\n1. Waste Management\nWaste Management, or WM, is one of the leading waste management companies in North America. It provides waste collection, transfer, and disposal services, as well as recycling and resource recovery. The company is also a leading developer and operator of landfill gas-to-energy facilities that produce renewable natural gas (RNG).\nIt provides its services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers. With demand for waste hauling relatively stable, its business is more recession-resistant than other industrial companies.\nOver the years, WM has invested in automating its collection truck fleet and converting it to run on cleaner, cheaper natural gas, including RNG. Moves like these have allowed WM to consistently generate free cash flow, giving it the funds to make acquisitions. In late 2024, it acquired Stericycle to expand its comprehensive environmental solutions into the growing healthcare sector. It's also investing $3 billion through 2026 on new or upgraded recycling facilities and RNG production facilities.\nThe company also routinely returns money to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. It hiked its dividend 10% for 2025, its 22nd straight year of increases. This strategy of expanding and also rewarding shareholders has enabled Waste Management to create significant shareholder value over the years.\n2. FedEx\nFedEx provides customers with transportation, e-commerce, and business services. The company operates a fleet of aircraft and vehicles, logistics facilities, and retail stores that help facilitate the shipment of millions of packages daily. It also offers a host of other logistics and e-commerce services that help businesses distribute their products to customers.\nE-commerce\nFedEx produces lots of free cash flow, which allows the company to pay a competitive and growing dividend. It can also repay debt to strengthen its balance sheet and make investments to expand its operations.\nFedEx\u2019s strong cash flow also enables the company to invest in innovation. The shipping company is testing autonomous vehicles and delivery services. Meanwhile, the company bought RouteSmart Technologies in 2025 to help further optimize delivery.\nThe company announced plans in 2025 to separate its FedEx Freight operations by creating a new publicly traded company. The company hopes to complete the separation within 18 months. The transaction will create two leading industrial companies and should unlock value for shareholders.\n3. Lockheed Martin\nLockheed Martin is a leading global security and aerospace company. It researches, designs, develops, and manufactures advanced technology systems, products, and services, primarily for government customers. The defense contractor has four main business segments: aeronautics, missiles and fire control, rotary and mission systems, and space.\nThe company invests billions of dollars annually on research and development (R&D) to advance the latest defense technology. It routinely complements its internal R&D program with acquisitions. In late 2024, the company acquired Terran Orbital to enhance its space capabilities. It also bought Amentum's Rapid Solutions business in 2025 to enhance its ability to deliver innovative defense technology.\nThe defense contractor should continue growing in the coming years. Recent wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have increased global defense spending. That trend will likely continue as geopolitical tensions remain high.\nLockheed Martin also has an excellent record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. In late 2024, it delivered its 22nd annual dividend increase, while boosting its share repurchase authorization by $3 billion to a total of $10 billion.\n4. Caterpillar\nCaterpillar is a leading global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. The company has three operating segments: construction industries, resource industries, and energy and transportation. It also provides financing and related services.\nCaterpillar is working toward making more sustainable equipment. It\u2019s collaborating with companies in the rail, energy, mining, and technology sectors on developing new technologies with lower carbon emissions. For example, it\u2019s working on both battery- and hydrogen-powered locomotives. It\u2019s also developing zero-emission haul trucks and equipment for the mining industry. The focus on sustainability will be a major growth driver for Caterpillar in the coming years as the global economy continues making progress on reducing carbon emissions.\nAnother major growth driver for Caterpillar is the increasing investment in infrastructure in the coming years. The U.S. is one of many countries that have boosted their spending on projects to maintain and expand highway and rail systems, bridges, and other infrastructure. The increased spending should drive more demand for construction equipment.\nThe company has continued to reward shareholders throughout economic cycles. It has raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years.\n5. GE Vernova\nGE Vernova is an energy equipment manufacturing and services company. It formed in 2024 after the once-mighty industrial giant GE completed its breakup. GE Vernova is the former GE Power and GE Renewable Energy businesses.\nThe company has three business segments:\n- Power: It provides electricity generation solutions like natural gas turbines to customers to produce power.\n- Wind: The company is a leader in producing wind turbines and other components to produce wind energy.\n- Electrification: It developed solutions to help modernize and digitize the electric grid.\nGE Vernova's products currently produce about 25% of the world's electricity. It manufactures turbines (natural gas and wind), positioning it to grow as demand for lower carbon energy rises. It also services its turbines for customers, providing the company with very stable cash flow.\nIdentifying the best companies\nHow to identify the best industrial companies\nThe strongest industrial companies have diversified operations, low operating costs, and investment-grade credit ratings. Diversification, a low cost structure, and access to affordable debt are important because of the cyclicality of the industrials sector. Economic downturns directly reduce the demand for industrial goods and services.\nIndustrial companies also need access to affordable debt because their operations are often very capital-intensive. Most industrial companies need to borrow money to buy new capital equipment and build new manufacturing facilities. Another benefit of a low-cost structure is less exposure to rising cost pressures in inflationary environments.\nWhile a company's financial performance is always relevant for investors, companies in the industrial sector need to maintain particularly strong financial positions. Prospective investors should pay close attention to how specific industrial companies fare in times of crisis.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nShould you buy industrial company stocks?\nThe industrial sector's cyclical nature makes industrial company stocks better suited for risk-tolerant investors. As we\u2019ve seen many times over the years, economic conditions can significantly change almost overnight. But in a booming economy, industrial company stocks can generate impressive returns for investors. Buy-and-hold investors who are comfortable with volatility can often earn strong returns by owning shares of high-quality industrial companies for the long term."

      "text": "A REIT (pronounced REET), or real estate investment trust, is an entity that holds a portfolio of commercial real estate or real estate loans. Congress created REITs in 1960 to provide all investors, especially retail investors, with access to income-producing commercial real estate. REITs combine the best features of real estate and stock investment.\nThis guide will walk you through everything you need to know about real estate investing through REITs. We\u2019ll cover the types of REITs, REIT pros and cons, how to invest in REITs, and what qualifies a company as a REIT.\nTypes of REITs\nTypes of REITs\nThere are several types of REITs. Let's start with classifying REITs by access:\n- Publicly traded REITs trade on major stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq Exchange. Anyone with a brokerage account can invest in a publicly traded REIT. Publicly traded REITs must register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and provide audited financial reports.\n- Public non-traded REITs are also open to all investors but don't trade on stock exchanges. Investors can purchase public non-traded REITs through their financial advisor or on online portals sometimes known as real estate crowdfunding platforms. Public non-traded REITs also must register with the SEC and provide audited financial information.\n- Private non-traded REITs aren't available to the public. They're usually only open to high-income earners or high-net-worth individuals. Private non-traded REITs are exempt from SEC registration.\nWithin those REIT types are three subcategories by asset type:\n- Equity REITs own and operate income-producing real estate such as apartments, office buildings, and warehouses.\n- Mortgage REITs, or mREITs, provide financing for real estate by purchasing or originating mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and earning fixed income from the interest on these investments. They typically hold a portfolio of income-producing mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, or other real estate-backed loans.\n- Hybrid REITs invest in a combination of income-producing real estate and real estate-backed loans.\nFinally, we'll look at the dozen equity REIT types by sector or property type:\n- Office REITs own and manage office real estate such as skyscrapers and office parks. Many office REITs focus on a specific region (New York City or the West Coast, for example) or a type of tenant (technology companies, government agencies, or biotech).\n- Industrial REITs own and manage industrial facilities such as warehouses, distribution centers, light manufacturing, or cold storage. Many of these properties are crucial for e-commerce. Most industrial REITs focus on a specific industrial property type or region.\n- Retail REITs own and manage retail real estate such as regional malls, shopping centers, or freestanding retail buildings. Most retail REITs will focus on a specific property type such as grocery-anchored shopping centers or freestanding retail properties triple net leased to essential retailers such as convenience stores and pharmacies.\n- Hospitality REITs own hotels and resorts, usually managed by a third-party hotel brand. They rent space in these properties to guests on a nightly or weekly basis.\n- Residential REITs own and manage residential real estate such as apartment communities, single-family homes, and manufactured home parks that they rent out to residents. Residential REITs focus on a specific property type.\n- Timberland REITs own and manage timberland. They specialize in harvesting and selling timber. Some timberland REITs also own wood products manufacturing facilities and sell portions of their real estate for other uses such as a housing development.\n- Healthcare REITs own and manage healthcare-related real estate such as senior living facilities, hospitals, medical office buildings, and skilled nursing facilities. They lease these properties back to healthcare systems that operate the facilities.\n- Self-storage REITs own and manage self-storage facilities that they rent to individuals and businesses.\n- Infrastructure REITs own and manage infrastructure such as fiber cables, telecommunications towers, and energy pipelines. They lease capacity on this infrastructure to mobile carriers or energy companies.\n- Data center REITs own and manage data storage facilities. They lease space in these facilities to technology companies and other businesses to house servers and other equipment. These REITs also provide an uninterruptible power supply, a regulated temperature, and physical security.\n- Diversified REITs own and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate. For example, they might have a portfolio of office properties, industrial real estate, and retail properties. Some diversified REITs focus on specific markets, owning a mix of residential, retail, and office properties in one city, while others are diversified by property type and geography.\n- Specialty REITs own and manage unique properties such as movie theaters, casinos, farmland, outdoor advertising, or ground leases.\nRelated investing topics\nPros and cons\nREIT pros and cons\nInvesting in REITs has several benefits, including:\n- They usually pay above-average dividend yields compared to other stocks, making them ideal for those seeking passive income from real estate.\n- They offer diversification from the stock market since REITs tend to be less volatile than other stocks.\n- REITs don't pay federal corporate income tax, shielding investors from \"double taxation.\"\n- They offer attractive total return potential, e.g., stock price appreciation plus dividend income.\n- Publicly traded REITs offer greater liquidity compared to owning real estate outright.\n- Public REITs are highly transparent, including providing audited financial statements.\n- Lower cost compared to buying commercial real estate outright.\nHowever, REITs also have some drawbacks, including:\n- Higher tax liabilities because REITs pay nonqualified dividends. Because of that, REITs are often best held in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA.\n- Sensitivity to changes in interest rates. REIT stock prices often decline as interest rates rise.\n- Property-specific risks such as tenant move-outs, industry headwinds, and technological disruption.\n- The risks of using too much debt.\nHow to buy REITs\nHow to buy in REITs\nInvestors have many ways to invest in REITs. The easiest is to buy shares of publicly traded REITs through a brokerage account. An investor could purchase a diversified REIT or invest in several different REITs to build a diversified portfolio. REITs are relatively inexpensive to buy, with most trading below $100 a share.\nAnother way to invest broadly across the REIT sector is to buy a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on REITs. REIT ETFs and REIT mutual funds are also easy to buy and relatively inexpensive to purchase.\nFinally, you can invest in public non-traded REITs through a financial advisor or a real estate crowdfunding portal. That makes them a little more challenging to purchase. They also often have higher minimum investments, usually $2,500 or more to start.\nHow does a company qualify as a REIT?\nHow does a company qualify as a REIT?\nCompanies must meet specific criteria to qualify as a REIT, which receive special tax treatment so they don't pay corporate income tax. These qualifications include:\n- REITs must pay out at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends each year. Many REITs will pay out more than 100% of their taxable income because their cash flow, measured by funds from operation (FFO), is often higher than income due to depreciation.\n- Be an entity that would be taxable as a corporation.\n- A board of directors or trustees must manage them.\n- They must have fully transferable shares.\n- Have a minimum of 100 shareholders after its first year as a REIT.\n- Have no more than 50% of its shares held by five or fewer people during the last half of its taxable year.\n- They must invest at least 75% of total assets in real estate assets or cash.\n- Get at least 75% of its gross income from real estate-related sources, including rents from real property, interest on mortgages, financing real property, and the sale of real estate.\n- A REIT must get at least 95% of its overall gross income from those real estate sources and dividends or interest from any source. In other words, 75% of its gross income must come from real estate, and only 5% can come from sources other than real estate, dividends, and interest income.\n- Have no more than 25% of its assets in non-qualifying securities or stock in a taxable REIT subsidiary.\nREITs often make great passive income investments\nCongress created REITs so that anyone could own income-producing real estate. REITs must pay a dividend, making them a great way to earn passive income. Add in their diversification benefits and historical returns, and REITs can be an excellent investment option."

      "text": "With just 30 components, the Dow Jones Industrial Average isn't as representative of the broader market as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite. But it's still an excellent resource for finding high-quality, industry-leading companies, many of which pay dividends.\nAfter nearly making an all-time high in July, Dow Jones component Honeywell International (HON 2.43%) is down 9.8% in the past month. The sell-off may come as a surprise, given that Honeywell delivered a great quarter, raised its guidance, and is producing high operating margins across its business segments.\nHere's why the dividend stock is a great buy in August.\nHoneywell's conglomerate days are rightfully coming to a close\nShortly after becoming CEO in June 2023, Vimal Kapur launched a comprehensive portfolio review of Honeywell's businesses to try to give the once thriving industrial conglomerate a jolt. The company had been languishing, failing to capitalize on its three highest-conviction megatrends: automation, the future of aviation, and the energy transition.\nKapur and his team concluded that the best way to unlock value for shareholders was to split the company into three separate publicly traded businesses: Honeywell Automation, Honeywell Aerospace, and Solstice Advanced Materials. In July, Honeywell said it is on track to spin off Solstice Advanced Materials for the fourth quarter of 2025 and the other two companies in the second half of 2026.\nThe conglomerate structure isn't inherently bad. In fact, it can work well when it provides diversification and resources to help each business segment perform.\nFor example, Berkshire Hathaway owns insurance businesses; retail, service, and manufacturing companies; the BNSF railroad; the utility and energy infrastructure company Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and more. By owning quality businesses across various industries, Berkshire accesses different growth opportunities and end markets. And by not overly managing its businesses and having a leadership structure with very little red tape, it can avoid many of the downsides of a conglomerate.\nHoneywell's decision to split into three companies is a way of admitting that being a big and bulky company with a lot of moving parts had become a net negative. And there's reason to believe each business can perform better as a stand-alone company.\nBut with roughly a year to go until the full separation is complete, Honeywell investors are caught in no-man's-land. The stock is down 8.3% since it published a news release on Dec. 16, 2024, announcing the decision to split into three companies.\nHoneywell has a compelling valuation and quality dividend\nBuying the stock now is based on the belief that the company is a good value and will be an even better one once it splits into three companies.\nHoneywell reported 8% sales growth and exceeded the high end of its prior guidance in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) with a 10% increase. Its updated 2025 guidance calls for $40.8 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue, $10.45 to $10.65 in adjusted EPS, and $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion in free cash flow (FCF) -- or $8.43 to $9.05 in FCF per share. On its second-quarter 2025 earnings call, management said that it is committed to offsetting tariff impacts with productivity, pricing, and alternative sourcing.\nBased on the stock price at the time of this writing of $216.31 per share, investors are paying just 20.5 times the midpoint of adjusted 2025 earnings and 24.7 times FCF. That's a steep discount to Honeywell's five-year median price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 25.5 and price-to-FCF of 29.5, and a good value compared to its 10-year median P/E of 23.6 and 24.5 price-to-FCF.\nOr put another way, Honeywell is already an attractive valuation. If the split is a success and unlocks value, it will look like a steal at these levels in hindsight.\nThe company has a 14-year streak of boosting its dividend, which yields 2.1% at the time of this writing. It remains to be seen what the dividend will look like post-split, but Honeywell has the FCF needed to support future dividend raises: The midpoint of its 2025 projected FCF per share is nearly double its $4.52 its annual payout.\nHoneywell is a buy before its breakup\nThe decision to split into three companies is the right move for investors, and the stock is a good value right now, making it a strong buy. Given how different aerospace is from industrial automation and sustainable materials, some investors may prefer to wait until post-breakup to invest in the business segment that is most appealing to them.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the valuations of each stand-alone company could vary based on their growth. For example, Honeywell Automation's potential in artificial intelligence may lead this segment to fetch a higher valuation than the aerospace business, where even industry leaders tend to command value stock P/E ratios.\nAll told, investors who wouldn't mind owning shares in all three stand-alone companies may want to consider buying Honeywell now before the breakup."

      "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/utilities/",
      "text": "Utility stocks are publicly traded companies that provide electricity, natural gas, and water services to customers. Utilities typically make stable investments. Demand for utility services tends to remain steady, even during a recession.\nThe rates utilities charge for delivering these services are either regulated (approved by a government entity) or contractually guaranteed (nonregulated). So, utilities generate reliable earnings, allowing them to pay dividends with above-average yields.\nThe combination of predictable profitability and income generation makes utility stocks lower-risk options for investors because they're less volatile. As a result, they're often ideal choices for retirement income strategies. That lower volatility also makes utilities more defensive, making them ideal holdings during uncertain economic times.\nHowever, not all utility stocks deliver competitive investment returns. The best utilities share additional noteworthy characteristics that give them the power to outperform. With that in mind, here are some top utility stocks to buy and what to look for in a utility investment.\nTop utility stocks\nThree top utility stocks to buy\nThe best utility investments are companies with a top-notch financial profile and visible growth prospects. Each of the companies below meets those criteria and has the potential to produce above-average total stock returns -- dividend yield plus stock price appreciation.\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Dividend yield | Industry |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) | $30 billion | 2.18% | Water Utilities |\n| Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE:BIPC) | $5 billion | 4.13% | Gas Utilities |\n| NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) | $157 billion | 2.83% | Electric Utilities |\nWater & waste\nAmerican Water Works\nAmerican Water Works is the largest publicly traded water and wastewater utility in the U.S. It makes most of its money by providing regulated water and wastewater services to retail, commercial, and industrial customers. The rest of its earnings come from less-predictable market-based activities, including providing water-related services to homeowners and the military.\nAmerican Water Works expects to grow its earnings per share (EPS) at a 7% to 9% compound annual rate over the long term, making it one of the fastest-growing utilities in the country. Driving that outlook is its plan to invest billions of dollars annually to expand its regulated water utility operations through capital investments and acquisitions.\nThe water utility has the financial flexibility to support its expansion plan thanks to its top-tier financial profile. It has an investment-grade credit rating, giving it the ability to borrow money at lower rates and better terms.\nIt also has a very conservative dividend payout ratio (it has targeted an average of between 50% and 60% of its adjusted EPS). Due to its strong financial profile, American Water Works forecasts dividend growth matching its earnings growth rate (7% to 9% annually). That would enable the utility to continue its dividend growth streak. It has raised its dividend every year since going public in 2008.\nInfrastructure\n2. Brookfield Infrastructure\nBrookfield Infrastructure owns a diversified portfolio of utility-like infrastructure businesses, including:\n- Utilities: Regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution businesses, smart meters, gas pipelines, electricity transmission lines, and residential decarbonization infrastructure\n- Transport: Railroads, toll roads, ports, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export operations, and intermodal containers supported by long-term contracts or regulated rate structures\n- Midstream: Oil and natural gas midstream assets backed by long-term contracts or regulated rates\n- Data: Data centers, cell towers, fiber-optic networks, and data transmission assets supported by long-term contracts with customers\nBrookfield Infrastructure operates several utilities and utility-like businesses that generate predictable cash flow that grows over time. The company benefits from inflation-linked rate escalations, higher volumes as the economy expands, and its ability to complete expansion projects.\nBrookfield believes these organic growth drivers alone can support 5% to 9% annual dividend growth over the long term. It increased its dividend by another 6% in early 2025, its 16th straight year of growth.\nIn addition to organic growth, Brookfield anticipates that acquisitions can further boost its earnings each year. The company and its partners agreed to buy the refined products pipeline company Colonial Enterprises for $9 billion in 2025. The business generates very stable utility-like cash flows to support Brookfield's growing dividend.\nBrookfield Infrastructure sees ample opportunities to expand its infrastructure platform in the coming years. That should enable the company to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend. These growth drivers should give it the power to produce attractive total returns in the coming years.\nEnergy\n3. NextEra Energy\nNextEra Energy operates a regulated electric utility in Florida. It also owns and operates natural gas pipelines, electricity transmission lines, and renewable energy projects that generate predictable income backed by long-term, fixed-rate contracts. These businesses supply NextEra with steady cash flow to support its dividend and invest in expanding its utility business.\nNextEra is investing billions of dollars in expanding its utility operations and clean energy business. The utility unveiled its Real Zero strategy to eliminate carbon emissions from its operations by 2045, which should be a major long-term growth driver.\nIn the near term, the company expects its investments to boost its EPS at or near the high end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through 2027. That's faster than the EPS growth rate projections of its largest peers in the electric utilities sector, which are in the low- to mid-single digits.\nAnother factor helping power above-average growth is NextEra's strong financial profile, which gives it the flexibility to fund its investments. Its profile includes one of the highest credit ratings among large rate-regulated electric utility companies and a dividend payout ratio that's historically been less than the sector average. Due to its lower payout ratio, NextEra plans to increase its dividend by roughly 10% annually through at least 2026.\nUtilities need a strong financial profile to maintain and expand infrastructure while also paying an attractive dividend.\nPros and cons\nPros and Cons of Investing in Utility Stocks\nInvesting in utilities has its benefits and drawbacks. Some of the pros include:\n- Above-average dividend income.\n- Lower volatility.\n- Predictable revenue and earnings.\n- Steady growth.\n- Rescession-resilient investment.\nMeanwhile, some of the cons of investing in utility stocks are:\n- Slower growth.\n- Lower return potential.\n- Higher debt levels.\n- More sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n- Regulatory risks.\nSelecting the best\nWhat makes a good utility stock investment?\nUtility infrastructure is costly to build and maintain. Utilities need a strong financial profile to maintain and expand infrastructure while also paying an attractive dividend. These three metrics can help you gauge a utility's financial strength:\nAn investment-grade bond rating\nA bond rating or credit rating for a company is like a credit score for an individual. Companies with higher investment-grade bond ratings can borrow money at lower rates and on easier terms.\nThat's important for utilities since they routinely need to borrow money to help fund maintenance and expansion projects. Investors should seek companies with high bond ratings since they can more easily finance their operations, which helps them increase their earnings and dividends.\nLow leverage metrics\nWhile utilities must borrow money to finance their operations, too much debt can limit their ability to grow. Investors should look for utilities with conservative leverage ratios for the sector.\nTwo notable ones are debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA (debt in relation to income), and debt to total capital (debt in relation to total value). Good targets for the sector are a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 4.5 times and a debt-to-capital value of less than 60%.\nA conservative dividend payout ratio\nA dividend payout ratio is the percentage of a company's profits paid to investors via its dividends. Utilities traditionally have higher dividend payout ratios than other companies. Most target a payout ratio between 60% to 70% of their earnings, much more than the 40% average of higher-yielding stocks in the S&P 500.\nHowever, utilities with a relatively lower payout retain more cash to reinvest in expansion projects. Consequently, they don't need to borrow as much money (which would lower their credit rating) or issue as many new shares (which would dilute existing investors\u2019 shares of their profits) to finance growth.\nUtilities with stronger financial profiles have greater flexibility to invest in expansion projects and make acquisitions, positioning them to expand their earnings at an above-average rate. The extra fiscal strength also gives them more power to increase their dividends.\nRelated investing topics\nThe best utility stocks offer above-average growth for less risk\nThese utility companies all have top-tier financial profiles. As a result, they have the flexibility to expand operations while also increasing their dividends. Utility stocks with dual growth drivers have the power to produce attractive total returns for investors over the long term. That makes them stand out as excellent investments.\nGiven the resilient demand for their services, their rate structures, and their long-term investment programs, top-tier utilities should be able to continue increasing their earnings even if the economy slows in the future. That makes adding a utility to your portfolio a smart investment if you're seeking to benefit from its income and stable growth profile.\nFAQ\nFAQ on utility stocks\nWhy are utility stocks going up?\nUtility stocks have been going up in recent years due to an expected surge in power demand. Catalysts like artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, the onshoring of manufacturing, and the electrification of everything could power an acceleration in power demand in the coming years. That could provide utilities with more investment opportunities to expand their operations, which would grow their earnings at faster rates. That potential growth acceleration is driving more investors to buy utility stocks, boosting their stock prices.\nWhat are the utility stocks with the highest dividends?\nThe dividend yields of utility stocks change based on their current stock price and dividend payment. In mid-2025, the five utilities with the highest yields were:\n- Edison International (NYSE: EIX): 6.1%\n- AES (NYSE: AES): 6.1%\n- Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A): 5.2%\n- NorthWestern Energy (NYSE: NWE): 5%\n- Portland General Electric (NYSE: POR): 4.9%\nDo utility stocks do well in a recession?\nUtility stocks typically do well in a recession. They generate fairly stable revenue and earnings during a downturn. Demand for electricity, water, and natural gas is steady, even during a recession, while their revenue is from government-regulated sources or long-term contracts. The overall stability of utilities tends to cause investors to buy their stocks during a recession to benefit from their dividend income and stable returns.\nHow safe are utility stocks?\nUtility stocks tend to be safer than most other companies. They typically generate very stable and steadily growing revenue, even during a session. Their revenue comes from government-regulated sources or long-term, fixed-rate contracts. Meanwhile, demand is steady during a downturn. Utilities also typically pay above-average dividends, providing investors with a solid base return."
