  "description": "The Cincinnati police union slammed a criminal case being brought against a victim in last month\u2019s viral beatdown over the man\u2019s alleged role in the violence.",
  "content": "The Cincinnati police union slammed a criminal case being brought against a victim in last month\u2019s viral beatdown over the man\u2019s alleged role in the violence.\n\nA 45-year-old White man was arrested earlier this week in connection to the assault in the city\u2019s downtown area, the Cincinnati Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\nAuthorities have not named the suspect, who police said was a victim in the attack and therefore is protected under Marsy\u2019s Law, which prevents officials from releasing his identity.\n\nHowever, the victim\u2019s attorney confirmed to Fox News that his name is Alex Tchervinski.\n\nTchervinski\u2019s lawyer, Douglas Brannon, revealed his client was allegedly hit in the head 28 times and robbed during the attack, while trying to protect his girlfriend and another friend while the group was enjoying a night out.\n\n\u201cWhat this has done, it has made Alex a victim now for the second time by bringing criminal charges against him,\u201d Brannon told Fox News.\n\nExclusive photos obtained by Fox News show Tchervinski with injuries to his head and face.\n\nBrannon reportedly pointed to his client acting in self-defense during the attack, while vowing to fight the charges.\n\n\u201cWhat actually occurred is Alex was hit multiple times, before he slapped back in an attempt to try and defend himself and back off this group of thugs,\u201d Brannon said.\n\nThe fight broke out on the corner of West Fourth and Elm streets in the early morning hours of July 26.\n\nBystander footage of the assault shows a White man hitting a Black man wearing a red shirt in the face, moments before the scene devolved into chaos, ultimately leaving six people injured and quickly going viral online.\n\nTchervinski is charged with disorderly conduct and has been ordered to appear in court on Aug. 26. He is the eighth person to be arrested for his alleged involvement in the beatdown.\n\nIn light of the latest development, community leaders throughout Cincinnati have spoken out about Tchervinski\u2019s arrest \u2013 with some officials previously calling for the individual to be charged, as the first seven suspects are Black.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear about the fact that anyone involved in perpetrating violence should be held accountable,\u201d Mayor Aftab Pureval said in a statement, according to WLWT. \u201cThis is another step toward achieving that, and I want to thank CPD and the prosecutors for their hard work as this process continues.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police President Ken Kober ripped the arrest after previously accusing the Pureval administration of exerting pressure on law enforcement to find a crime to charge the victims with.\n\n\u201cCity Solicitor [Emily] Woerner and the Pureval administration\u2019s blatant political meddling is the most egregious I\u2019ve witnessed in my career,\u201d Kober said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \u201cOverruling law enforcement and prosecutors for cheap political points is a disgraceful stain on our city, and those responsible should be utterly ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nOhio state Rep. Cecil Thomas sounded off on the severity of the charges, after previously hosting a town hall to discuss the city\u2019s handling of the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe charge of Disorderly Conduct, a fourth-degree misdemeanor, is a slap in the face to the Black Community,\u201d Thomas said in a statement to Fox News.\n\n\u201cThis only inflames the community even more. The proper charges for him should have been assault and aggravated rioting. However, if the city or prosecutor truly wanted to diffuse this situation and bring the temperature down, they should drop all aggravated rioting charges and reduce all felonious assault charges down to misdemeanor assault, except for the individual that struck the lady. Under no circumstance can I condone a man hitting a woman. Charge everyone, black or white accordingly and let the courts decide their fate. End of story.\u201d\n\nDavid Whitehead, president of the city\u2019s NAACP chapter, also reportedly reacted to the new charges.\n\n\u201cThe Cincinnati NAACP stands by and advocates for justice under the law,\u201d Whitehead said, according to WLWT. \u201cWe still question the fairness in charging based on the information we have seen and the conversations we have had. Street altercations typically result in disorderly conduct charges and there are at least five defendants being charged beyond that. We look forward to learning more about the cases and receiving the findings of the final investigation. In the meantime, we encourage everyone who believes in a fair judicial system to register to vote, because that\u2019s how jury pools are determined.\u201d\n\nPureval and Whitehead did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.\n\nPatrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, are each charged with three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\nLast week, authorities also announced the arrest of 32-year-old Gregory Wright. Wright was arraigned on alleged aggravated riot and aggravated robbery charges on Thursday morning, where he appeared virtually in the Hamilton County Jail.\n\nAccording to court documents, Wright, who is a convicted heroin trafficker with a lengthy criminal record, \u201cdid by force rip the necklace off the victim while he was being assaulted by four or more co-defendants, attempting to cause serious physical harm.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, an Ohio judge lowered Wright\u2019s bond from $100,000 to $50,000, but he is only required to pay 10% \u2013 or $5,000 \u2013 to be released.\n\nWright\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.\n\nFox News\u2019 Patrick McGovern and Mike Tobin contributed to this report.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Fourth slugger busted in Cincinnati brawl as new video shows moments before melee\nA fourth person has been busted in connection with the vicious brawl in Cincinnati that left two people seriously injured, as new video shows the victims lobbing racial slurs at their attackers moments before the beatdown.\nDominique Kittle, 37, was arrested around 6:20 p.m. Friday, nearly a week after he allegedly pummeled a woman and a man, police announced.\nKittle was charged with felonious assault and aggravated riot. His bond was set at $150,000.\nHis fellow alleged sluggers Jermaine Matthews, 39; Montianez Merriweather, 34; and Dekyra Vernon, 24, were put behind bars earlier this week.\nTwo others have been charged with the brutal beatdown and are being tracked down by a fugitive task force. Authorities said they will not release their identities until they are captured.\nThe group is accused of coordinating an \u201cambush\u201d on six victims, even as one of their victims lay defenseless on the city street \u2014 igniting racial tensions and widespread concern.\n\u201cWhat we all witnessed in the viral video early Saturday morning was not only disturbing, but outright cruel. It was an act of violence that shook us all,\u201d Police Chief Teresa Theetge said at a news conference.\nKittle\u2019s arrest came down the same day another video surfaced of the moments before the beatdown began \u2014 and shows one of the men who police labeled a victim hurling racial slurs.\nFollow for the latest on the Cincinnati brawl that left single mother viciously beaten\n- Cincinnati leaders \u2018demanding prosecution\u2019 of white man who used racial slur in viral street brawl\n- Single mom battered by Cincinnati mob slams \u2018insulting\u2019 police chief for calling the beatdown an \u2018incident\u2019\n- Single mom knocked out by Cincinnati mob opens up about her pain and panic: \u2018I should be dead\u2019\n- Fourth slugger busted in Cincinnati brawl as new video shows moments before melee\n\u201cGet him! Get that little n\u2014-r!\u201d the man said in the video obtained by The Enquirer.\nTwo black men appear to talk to the man in an attempt to calm him down before the chaos erupted, according to the video provided by attorney Brandon Fox, who is representing Matthews.\nThe family of Merriweather also claims he was called racial slurs and spat on in the lead up to the brawl.\nPolice say Merriweather approached Matthews, whispered to him and then the pair slugged the man in the face. Fox, however, claims the men don\u2019t know one another and that Merriweather had been fighting another individual.\n\u201cIt was not a Black, racist mob attacking people,\u201d Fox told the outlet. \u201cThese were separate fights that were triggered by racial slurs that ultimately poured gasoline on the fire.\u201d\nRace has been a focus of the vicious street fight, with the four arrested individuals \u2014 all black \u2014 being accused of racism against the white victims.\nOne of the badly beaten victims was a woman named Holly, who fled back to her home in Russia after she was left with a gruesome black eye, busted lip, and bruises covering her face and neck during the melee.\nThe viral footage showed what appeared to be Holly getting sucker-punched and knocked out cold, with blood pouring from her mouth as she lay defenseless on the ground after trying to intervene in the rumble.\nCops have vowed to release more footage of the brawl, promising it \u201ctells a little more of the story.\u201d"

      "text": "The Cincinnati police union slammed a criminal case being brought against a victim in last month\u2019s viral beatdown over the man's alleged role in the violence.\nA 45-year-old White man was arrested earlier this week in connection to the assault in the city\u2019s downtown area, the Cincinnati Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital.\nAuthorities have not named the suspect, who police said was a victim in the attack and therefore is protected under Marsy\u2019s Law, which prevents officials from releasing his identity.\nVICTIM IN VIRAL CINCINNATI STREET BRAWL NOW CHARGED IN CASE, POLICE SAY\nHowever, the victim's attorney confirmed to Fox News that his name is Alex Tchervinski.\nTchervinski's lawyer, Douglas Brannon, revealed his client was allegedly hit in the head 28 times and robbed during the attack, while trying to protect his girlfriend and another friend while the group was enjoying a night out.\n\"What this has done, it has made Alex a victim now for the second time by bringing criminal charges against him,\" Brannon told Fox News.\nCINCINNATI VIRAL BEATING SUSPECT HIT WITH FEDERAL GUN CHARGE\nExclusive photos obtained by Fox News show Tchervinski with injuries to his head and face.\nBrannon reportedly pointed to his client acting in self-defense during the attack, while vowing to fight the charges.\nCINCINNATI LEADERS 'DEMANDING PROSECUTION' OF WHITE MAN IN VIRAL STREET FIGHT\n\"What actually occurred is Alex was hit multiple times, before he slapped back in an attempt to try and defend himself and back off this group of thugs,\" Brannon said.\nThe fight broke out on the corner of West Fourth and Elm streets in the early morning hours of July 26. Bystander footage of the assault shows a White man hitting a Black man wearing a red shirt in the face, moments before the scene devolved into chaos, ultimately leaving six people injured and quickly going viral online.\nTchervinski is charged with disorderly conduct and has been ordered to appear in court on Aug. 26. He is the eighth person to be arrested for his alleged involvement in the beatdown.\nCINCINNATI BRAWL TIMELINE: BRUTAL ASSAULT SPIRALS INTO NATIONAL FIRESTORM\nIn light of the latest development, community leaders throughout Cincinnati have spoken out about Tchervinski\u2019s arrest \u2013 with some officials previously calling for the individual to be charged, as the first seven suspects are Black.\n\"We have been clear about the fact that anyone involved in perpetrating violence should be held accountable,\" Mayor Aftab Pureval said in a statement, according to WLWT. \"This is another step toward achieving that, and I want to thank CPD and the prosecutors for their hard work as this process continues.\"\nHowever, Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police President Ken Kober ripped the arrest after previously accusing the Pureval administration of exerting pressure on law enforcement to find a crime to charge the victims with.\n\"City Solicitor [Emily] Woerner and the Pureval administration\u2019s blatant political meddling is the most egregious I\u2019ve witnessed in my career,\" Kober said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Overruling law enforcement and prosecutors for cheap political points is a disgraceful stain on our city, and those responsible should be utterly ashamed of themselves.\"\nWATCH: Body camera footage shows officers responding to lone 911 call following viral Cincinnati attack\nOhio state Rep. Cecil Thomas sounded off on the severity of the charges, after previously hosting a town hall to discuss the city\u2019s handling of the investigation.\n\"The charge of Disorderly Conduct, a fourth-degree misdemeanor, is a slap in the face to the Black Community,\" Thomas said in a statement to Fox News. \"This only inflames the community even more. The proper charges for him should have been assault and aggravated rioting. However, if the city or prosecutor truly wanted to diffuse this situation and bring the temperature down, they should drop all aggravated rioting charges and reduce all felonious assault charges down to misdemeanor assault, except for the individual that struck the lady. Under no circumstance can I condone a man hitting a woman. Charge everyone, black or white accordingly and let the courts decide their fate. End of story.\"\nCINCINNATI VIRAL BEATING BODYCAM RELEASED AS SUSPECTS FACE NEW CHARGES IN GRAND JURY INDICTMENT\nDavid Whitehead, president of the city\u2019s NAACP chapter, also reportedly reacted to the new charges.\n\"The Cincinnati NAACP stands by and advocates for justice under the law,\" Whitehead said, according to WLWT. \"We still question the fairness in charging based on the information we have seen and the conversations we have had. Street altercations typically result in disorderly conduct charges and there are at least five defendants being charged beyond that. We look forward to learning more about the cases and receiving the findings of the final investigation. In the meantime, we encourage everyone who believes in a fair judicial system to register to vote, because that\u2019s how jury pools are determined.\"\nPureval and Whitehead did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.\nCINCINNATI RESIDENTS ON EDGE AFTER VIRAL BEATDOWN SPARKS CRIME CONCERNS: 'WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?'\nPatrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, are each charged with three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.\nLast week, authorities also announced the arrest of 32-year-old Gregory Wright. Wright was arraigned on alleged aggravated riot and aggravated robbery charges on Thursday morning, where he appeared virtually in the Hamilton County Jail.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAccording to court documents, Wright, who is a convicted heroin trafficker with a lengthy criminal record, \"did by force rip the necklace off the victim while he was being assaulted by four or more co-defendants, attempting to cause serious physical harm.\"\nOn Thursday, an Ohio judge lowered Wright\u2019s bond from $100,000 to $50,000, but he is only required to pay 10% \u2013 or $5,000 \u2013 to be released.\nWright's attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nFox News' Patrick McGovern and Mike Tobin contributed to this report."

Some of the arrests include traffic violations like driving without a license or proper insurance, but some are more serious, like drug trafficking and gun charges. Through plea deals or outright dismissals, Wright has walked on many of the charges.\nHowever, in 2014, he was convicted of trafficking heroin, a felony.\nHe pleaded guilty to drug possession in 2016, and was issued a $210 fine.\nIn 2021, he was convicted of illegally concealing a firearm and possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, but sentenced only to probation.\nRecords show he violated that probation several times.\nAccording to Hamilton County Chief Public Defender Raymond Feller, Wright was represented by a private attorney, Carl Lewis, at a Friday court appearance.\nFox News Digital reached out to Lewis.\nFIFTH SUSPECT ARRESTED IN VIRAL CINCINNATI BEATDOWN AS VICTIM DETAILS HER 'ONGOING BATTLE'\nLast week, six of the co-defendants in the case were formally arraigned on new charges in a Hamilton County courtroom.

      "text": "5 charged in horrifying viral Cincinnati brawl that left woman knocked out cold\nFive people have been charged over a vicious beatdown on a Cincinnati street after footage of the wild brawl went viral.\nThe suspects\u2019 names were not released, and Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge declined to specify the charges \u2014 but cautioned that more arrests were expected.\n\u201cWe have five we have charged, and anticipate more,\u201d Theetge told reporters Monday, two days after the 3 a.m. Saturday incident that she referred to as a \u201cfight.\u201d\nAccoding to online videos, the \u201cfight\u201d consisted of a mob stomping on the head of a man cowering on a downtown street, while a woman was cold-cocked and knocked out, with blood pouring from her mouth, after she tried to intervene.\nTheetge, however, tried to downplay the brawl, calling the weekend \u201coutside of this one incident, an amazing success for this city\u201d while explaining that a baseball game and music festival happening in Cincinnati that night both went off without a hitch.\n\u201cWe had one incident \u2014 one incident \u2014 late Friday night into Saturday morning that is getting all the attention and undoing the good stuff that happened this weekend,\u201d she said.\nThere was also no update given on the condition of the targets of the assault \u2014 with Theetge saying she didn\u2019t know if anyone was hospitalized afterward, but that the victims \u201cappeared to be as well as could be expected\u201d when police arrived.\nBut Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said he spoke to the woman who was knocked out, claiming she was a mother named Holly who told him \u201cnot a single local or state official had yet reached out\u201d to her besides \u201cone police detective.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a single working mom who went to a friend\u2019s birthday party,\u201d the former GOP presidential hopeful said. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that there were no police present in that area of Cincinnati on a Friday night, or even an ambulance to take her to the hospital.\u201d\nCincinnati Fraternal Order of Police president Ken Kober told WLWT the victims suffered \u201cpretty serious injuries\u201d and would be \u201crecovering from this for a while.\u201d\nTheetge, however, disputed critics\u2019 characterization of the downtown police presence, saying officers were on scene within six minutes of receiving a call about the brawl and that it had ended and dispersed by the time they arrived.\nBut she also appeared to blame residents of her city who saw the fight for any delay in response \u2014 saying upward of 100 people were either involved or watching, but that only a single person called 911.\nThe chief also admonished the press, accusing reporters of playing video of the incident that only showed \u201cone version of what occurred\u201d \u2014 though she did not elaborate on what she meant by that.\nExactly what sparked the fight remains unclear, but footage indicated it started as an argument between two men before quickly escalating.\nThe man taking the brunt of the attack was white, while his assailants appeared to be largely black.\nOne witness told WXIX somebody made a racial comment before the beating began, though those reports are unconfirmed and it is unclear who supposedly said what.\nFootage of the brawl \u2014 which was extremely graphic, and included the man at its center being body-slammed at one point \u2014 spread rapidly online over the weekend, with Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk even weighing in and calling for arrests.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the full context, but what I saw is a mob of lawless thugs beating up on an innocent person,\u201d the vice president and former Ohio senator said.\n\u201cWhere I come from at least, when you have a grown man who sucker-punches a middle-aged woman, that person ought to go to jail for a very long time,\u201d Vance added."

Tchervinski's attorney claims he was assaulted while trying to protect his girlfriend and friends, and argues that the charges further victimized him. The incident, which left several people injured, has sparked significant community backlash and raised concerns about racial dynamics, as the initial suspects were predominantly Black.",
