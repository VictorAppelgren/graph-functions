  "title": "Billie Eilish\u2019s Debut Album Hits Half A Decade On The Charts",
  "description": "Billie Eilish\u2019s When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? reaches 260 weeks on the U.K. Albums chart, becoming her first title to spend half a decade on the tally.",
  "content": "Billie Eilish recently wrapped the U.K. leg of her Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour. The superstar singer-songwriter played six nights at The O2 Arena in London and then headed to Manchester before moving on to Ireland, and soon, Asia.\n\nAround her visit to the U.K., Eilish\u2019s entire catalog surged on the charts in that country. Now that all the excitement has faded, all three of her full lengths are on the decline, but one of her earliest projects hits a special landmark number, even as it slips.\n\nWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? Reaches Half a Decade\n\nWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? steps back five spots on the Official Albums chart, declining from No. 72 to No. 77. Even as it dips, the project reaches 260 weeks on the ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.K. \u2014 a full half-decade on the roster. This is a feat reserved for only the most famous musicians and the most successful albums.\n\nEilish reaches half a decade on the Official Albums chart for the first time. Only a short time ago, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? passed her debut EP Don\u2019t Smile at Me. That project, which missed out on the top 10 and doesn\u2019t find space on the list as frequently as her trio of full lengths, has thus far racked up 247 stays somewhere on the tally.\n\nWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? Lives on Five Charts\n\nWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? can be found on five rankings across the Atlantic. As it steps back on both the Official Albums and Official Albums Streaming charts, the project manages to climb on the Official Album Sales and Official Physical Albums tallies. Eilish even sends the title back into the top 40 on the Official Vinyl Albums roster, where it reenters at No. 36.\n\nWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? Made Billie Eilish a Star\n\nBy the time Eilish released When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? in 2019, she was already one of the most talked-about newcomers in the music industry \u2014 even though she was only a teenager. The full length became her first No. 1 in countries all around the world and produced smashes like \u201cYou Should See Me in a Crown\u201d and \u201cBad Guy.\u201d The set won her all four of the most important Grammy Awards \u2014 Album, Record, and Song of the Year, as well as Best New Artist \u2014 and turned her into a household name globally.\n\nHit Me Hard and Soft and Happier Than Ever\n\nAll three of Eilish\u2019s full lengths appear on the Official Albums chart this week. Hit Me Hard and Soft, her newest, continues to live inside the top 20 even as it falls on five rankings. Happier Than Ever dips outside the upper half, while managing to climb several spots on the vinyl tally.",
