  "title": "I love traveling to Italy, but always skip the Amalfi Coast. Here are 4 seaside destinations I like to visit instead.",
  "description": "I've been to Italy many times and have enjoyed exploring the country's coastline. I recommend visiting seaside areas like Cinque Terre and Calabria.",
  "content": "With breathtaking cliffs towering above the Tyrrhenian Sea, terraced gardens, and pastel-colored villages, it's easy to see why the Amalfi Coast is at the top of many travelers' bucket lists.Despite its charm, though, I've never visited because the area can be expensive to visit and become crowded with the over 5 million tourists who visit each year.Instead, I've worked my way through the country's other extensive coastal regions, and there is no shortage of breathtaking scenery to explore.From Puglia's beautiful beaches to Calabria's charming towns, here are four alternative Italian seaside destinations I love.Translating to the \"five lands,\" Cinque Terre is a string of villages (Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore) in northwestern Italy along the Italian Riviera.Each town has distinctive qualities, from Monterosso al Mare's sandy beaches and Manarola's picturesque overlook to the secluded cliffs of Corniglia.Plus, they're all uniquely connected via hiking trails, walking paths, and train lines, offering a customizable itinerary for every traveler.Before leaving, I recommend sampling some of the region's specialties: pesto, mussels, and white wine (specifically the Cinque Terre DOC) at restaurants like Osteria A Cantina De Mananan or L'Ancora Della Tortuga.Puglia, the southeastern region of Italy that forms the country's \"heel,\" is often associated with its beautiful beaches.One of my favorites is Baia dei Turchi. I think its shallow, crystal-blue waters are perfect for swimming and snorkeling.While there, I was also captivated by one of the region's distinct architectural features: trulli houses. These traditional Puglian dry stone huts with cone-shaped roofs are unique to the Itria Valley.Located south of the Amalfi Coast, in the province of Salerno, is the Cilento Coast.Home to a national park and a plethora of archeological sites, mountains, and beaches, I think this area has something for every traveler.I recommend exploring the turquoise waters of Cala Bianca in Marina di Camerota or sailing to nearby Baia degli Infreschi, a beach that's perfect for swimming and relaxation.And don't forget to check out the food. The region is known for buffalo mozzarella, a plethora of seafood specialties (my favorite is swordfish), and fresh local crops like artichokes and tomatoes.Occupying the \"toe\" of Italy's boot-shaped peninsula is Calabria. Like the Amalfi Coast, this region boasts breathtaking cliffs and charming towns.La Costa Viola, or the Violet Coast, is one of my favorite spots. Located along the Tyrrhenian Sea, its vibrant purple-hued sea and the enchanting town of Scilla make this stretch of coastline extremely scenic and memorable.Another city worth visiting is Tropea, located along Calabria's \"Coast of the Gods.\" Aptly named, the town has a vibrant history, full of Greek legends and mythology. Plus, its powder-sand beaches make it a favorite destination among visitors and locals alike.Calabria is also known for having some of the spiciest cuisine in Italy. I recommend trying pizza and pasta dishes with Calabrian chiles and 'nduja (a spicy sausage spread) \u2014 two popular foods that originated here.",

  "summary": "The Amalfi Coast, Italy's coastal regions, can be expensive to visit and overcrowded due to the influx of tourists, but these destinations are often overlooked. Instead, these authors suggest visiting the Cinque Terre region, a string of villages in northwestern Italy along the Italian Riviera that offer distinctive qualities and are uniquely connected via hiking trails, walking paths, and train lines. They also recommend sampling some of the region's specialties, including pesto, mussels, and white wine, before leaving.
