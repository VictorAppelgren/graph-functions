  "content": "Ram's 2026 1500 V8 eTorque May Pack A Hemi, But There's A Surprise Beyond The Burnouts\n\nAt the end of last year, Ram's new CEO Tim Kuniskis decided to bring the Hemi V8 back to the 1500 pickup truck lineup. Now sure, the company can claim that customer demand dictated the decision, but putting a former Dodge and SRT dude at the helm clearly played a major part, too. This Christmas gift to gearheads necessarily required a bit of delayed gratification, though, since Ram then needed to figure out the logistics of how, exactly, to reintroduce the Hemi into a new generation of pickups. Doing so proved slightly more complex than expected, especially working on an accelerated timeline, because the latest generation of Ram's best-selling 1500 incorporates more electronic controls than ever before. The V8 might stay the same, but the ICE engine needs to interact with the eTorque hybrid system for everything from braking regen and traction control software to noise cancellation programming. Now, that truck will arrive for model year 2026, and Ram recently held a media drive to prove exactly why the company needed to cater to customers in such large numbers.\n\nGive it a Hemi, but make it Hybrid Perhaps emphasizing Ram's\u2014and Kuniskis'\u2014Dodge roots, the demo day included plenty of hilarity. Burnouts? Mandatory, all the better to accentuate the Hemi eTorque's 395 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque. We're straight back to early-2000s \"That thang got a Hemi?\" and towing up fiery ramp truck commercials, and I, for one, am totally here for it. Out of the total power ratings, the 48-volt hybrid system's 0.43-kilowatt-hour battery can power a 12-kilowatt belt-starter generator (purposefully designed to cosplay as a Hellcat supercharger, by my eye) that contributes up to 130 lb-ft of launch torque\u2014even if the new 1500 features no line lock a la the Dodge Demon. Instead, by selecting two-wheel drive and locking the rear diff, with Sport mode activated and traction control as switched off as possible, feathering the brake and hammering the throttle essentially tricked the computers into not killing power. Ram disallows the full defeat of ESC, but using the gear limit buttons to stick in 1st and 2nd helped to spin up those rear tires. It's not the easiest technique, clearly, but this pickup truck certainly managed to roast plenty of rubber on a hot morning. And that's not to mention the sound, since Ram also decided to ship the GT exhaust system as standard equipment.\n\nWhat is this, a Hellcat? Nearby on a coned-off autocross circuit, further comedy ensued as media hustled the big crew-cabs around the pristine asphalt at top speed. I faked a launch control by left-foot braking, but even with the eTorque system, that V8 still needs to get up into the power band by about 25 miles an hour. Then I stomped on the brake, bringing on some light ABS chatter, and tried the first corner. The 1500 actually managed okay, with some expected nosedive and understeer through the wide sweeping righthander. A testament to the Ram's coilsprung rear end, though, the tail felt planted enough once I finished trail braking and tried to transition back onto throttle. Unfortunately, these trucks lack paddle shifters, so once in the wrong gear, the only way to downshift was to trick the ECU by effectively flooring the gas pedal and unwinding the steering wheel until the engine opened up again. The interplay reminded me a bit of fooling with EVs while trying to drift, but once the power started flowing, I pushed harder into another increasing radius lefthander.\n\nAutocross in a pickup truck makes no sense, but lots of grins Tires squealing and toasting, brakes chattering, big V8 bellowing\u2014the Ram got the job done, even if absolutely nobody on hand could argue that the job itself was undeniably necessary. These little primers before heading out for stints on public roads proved that under heavy loads and ideal conditions, the V8 packaged with a mild hybrid system sounds good, delivers plenty of power, and integrates smoothly with the eTorque setup. And the V8 package only adds $1,200 for 2026, which includes that standard GT exhaust. That number pales in comparison to the previous pricing on Mopar's website, at $1,700 for the exhaust alone or the Hemi as a standalone option at the tail end of the previous generation in 2024 for over $3,000. And all as the twin-turbo V6 engine dropped in price by $1,000. Now throw on the new 10-year/100,000-mile warranty. Talk about a heulluva deal, brother. Clearly, Ram wants to entice those claimed 40% of current 1500 owners who claimed they would switch to another manufacturer for their next purchase if no Hemi returned to the lineup.\n\nThroughout the high-performance driving portion of the day, I never noticed any hiccups as the Hemi reintegrated with updated electronic controls. The system never seems to rely too heavily on either ICE or electric power, instead working together smoothly to deliver those little hits of instantaneous torque perfectly until the burbling exhaust indicates the Hemi raring to rumble. The effects only got better throughout the rest of the day's real-world driving on public roads. Almost more importantly than the Hemi's soundtrack, in fact, the truck actually drives so silently that I almost forgot the V8 existed. Ram's noise cancellation must handle part of the job, but the eTorque assist also provides the grunt to satisfy little nudges into the throttle, which results in less strain on the ICE powerplant. Fuel economy, while not great at official ratings of 17 MPG city, 23 highway, and 19 combined, still comes out better than a full-ICE truck without doubt.\n\nIs the eTorque too smooth for Hemi fans? I actually began to wonder, while cruising along in such serenity, whether Hemi fans might want more character, more exhaust bark, more noise in general. Unfortunately, to get that, I needed to drive more aggressively, unleashing my inner Charger and Challenger Hellcat bro spirit, only in pickup truck form. Doing so brought me back to the days of Ram's original street-sport pickup truck, the Li'l Red Express. Clearly, mind games work on me, because Ram also brought out a Li'l Red Express on a trailer to serve as a towing demonstration. Loaded up, the classic truck on the lightweight trailer weighed 6,100 pounds total. The 2026 pickup absolutely dwarfs the ancestral variant, which served as a solid representation of average hauling against the Ram 1500 Hemi's total tow rating of 9,960 pounds (for this Long Horn Crew Cab trim with the 5'7\" bed\u2014a Tradesman bumps that figure up to 11,320 pounds).\n\nThe Hemi eTorque battled aero and weight while towing just fine, delivering enough pep to get up to highway speeds without concern and even managing overtaking fairly easily. Of course, the ungodly torque of a Cummins diesel will do better in terms of both acceleration and fuel economy while towing, but for a Crew Cab 1500 that might double as an urban getabout or a modest trucky truck, the eTorque made up for most of any gap against the bigger HD options. Then there's the off-roading packages, the new Warlock for the 2500 joins the lineup alongside the 1500 variant. I got to take an HD Warlock for a brief off-roading experience, rather than the 1500 Hemi, but suspect that the eTorque's easy modulation of power, plus the coilsprings, should go a long way toward smoothness\u2014again, for modest trial running, rather than any hardcore rock crawling.\n\nThe point being, I suppose, that all this is electronic anyway. Electric assist for the return of a beefy V8, so much tech controlling drive modes and infotainment, even ride height adjustment for ideal towing aerodynamics. The irony of emphasizing the prehistoric Hemi's return in such a modernized pickup truck remains strong, and even more absurd given that the TRX's RHO replacement sticks with the Hurricane twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six putting down 540 horsepower and 521 lb-ft of torque\u2014and just gets a new Magnaflow exhaust to maintain pride of place versus less performance-focused 1500 trucks with the V8 eTorque. Maybe that'll change, too, given Kuniskis' clear proclivities. But in the meantime, on the volume trucks that actually move units, Ram needed to give the customers what they want. And we all want Hemis, apparently, even if it means sticking with a mild eTorque setup rather than pressing onward into more substantial plug-in hybrid capability or the endless power of full electrification.",

      "text": "2025 Ram 1500 RHO First Drive: It's Fun, It Flies, And It's Better Than The TRX\nBy six-word sentence standards, \"you can go faster, you know\" ranks pretty highly on the fun scale, at least when you're facing down an off-road course at the wheel of the 2025 Ram 1500 RHO. The latest entrant to the excessive \u2014 and controversial \u2014 performance pickup segment may not be the most potent, but then neither is it the most expensive. And, as truck fans know, there's far more than horsepower to consider when it comes to beasting it in Baja mode.\nThe RHO isn't the 1500 TRX replacement many have been hoping for \u2014 Ram is playing its cards close to its chest on what comes after the end-of-life TRX \u2014 but a value play of sorts. Though it's far from the most powerful sport pickup \u2014 Ford's F-150 Raptor R brings a heady 720 horsepower to the party, and the TRX has 702 horsepower \u2014 Ram's pitch is that this top-of-the-1500-tree truck has the most horses per dollar, at about $133 per horsepower when you factor in the $69,995 starting price and $1,995 destination.\nThat Raptor R lands at about $156 per horsepower, in contrast, while the V6 F-150 Raptor is higher still, at around $179 per horsepower. Chevrolet's Silverado 1500 ZR2 with the optional 6.2L V8 clocks in at $175 per horsepower.\nThe V8 is gone, but that's not the biggest news\nRam's 540 horsepower and 521 lb-ft of torque comes courtesy of the 3.0-liter Hurricane High Output (H/O) straight-six twin-turbo engine. It's paired with the familiar eight-speed automatic transmission, and indeed other 1500 models with the same engine muster the same output numbers. Ram says that, thanks to the new fresh air intake atop the RHO's hood, and the true dual exhaust with its flow control valve, you end up getting more performance at your foot from its new sport truck.\nA million horses would be useless off-road, of course, without better suspension and other upgrades. For the 2025 1500 RHO, that means independent front and five-link coil rear suspension, with Bilstein Black Hawk e2 adaptive performance shocks \u2014 there are 13 inches of front and 14 inches of rear wheel travel, along with 11.8 inches of ground clearance on the standard 35-inch tires \u2014 plus a Dana 60 rear axle with rear electronic locking differential, and a BorgWarner 48-13 full-time active transfer case.\nManaging it all \u2014 among the usual manual adjustments that contribute to the 1500's button-heavy dashboard and option-packed touchscreen \u2014 are nine drive modes. That includes Sport and Auto (the latter setting up a 40:60 power split front to rear), but also a Baja mode that shoves 75% of the torque to the rear wheels, dials back the stability control, and fettles the dampers to be more suited to off-road silliness.\nEncouraging bad behavior\nUsually, with a new vehicle, I make a point of heading out for a road test first. After all, regardless of off-road (or track) capabilities, regular asphalt is where most of an owner's time will be spent. The lure, however, of the off-road course at Holly Oaks ORV Park near Flint, MI \u2014 where Ram invited SlashGear for the day to try out the 2025 RHO \u2014 was too strong for a sensible approach.\nRam's customized course covered plenty of bases. Stretches of sand and gravel; tight turns and narrow tracks, suddenly widening into the sort of broad, loose-surfaced sections begging you to wag your truck's tail. Ruts and potholes that lesser vehicles could easily lose a wheel in, or worse. All culminating with a trio of jumps intended to give the RHO some quality airtime.\nRam's engineer \u2014 part of the team that took development trucks out for 1,000+ mile off-road torture testing \u2014 in the passenger seat was there for goading rather than demanding caution. With the truck in Baja mode, fun ensues.\nRam's upgraded suspension is magical\nThe RHO surges forward eagerly, the Hurricane H/O swift to unlock its grunt and the burly rubber putting it down neatly despite the shifting surfaces. It's when you yank the wheel, though, that the merits really make themselves clear. The steering is 5% faster, and with about 150 pounds removed from the front end versus the TRX, getting the Ram to pivot neatly is easier than you might expect.\nKicking the rear end out in big, dust-rousing slides, however, is equally good fun. Again, the faster steering helps there \u2014 there's less arm-exhausting wheel-spinning \u2014 and Ram's semi-tamed electronic nannies do a refined job of assisting without spoiling the overall whimsy. You can, of course, go beyond Ram's preconfigured drive modes and tweak things like traction and stability control yourself.\nIt's the suspension that's the star of the show, though. Soft enough not to launch you straight to the chiropractor's table after catching air, yet firm enough to hold its own in traction-stealing whoops and dig deep into the sand. It's bizarrely capable, to the point that you can easily forget the sort of mass you're dealing with here. The RHO's 15-inch front and rear disc brakes are good, but there were definitely times the compliant ride lulled me, only for the truck-like braking distances to snap me back into reality.\nThe magic, Ram's engineers explained to me, is in the electronic suspension tuning, and how the RHO can tap into the various sensors embedded in the truck. Rather than simply recognizing that you're airborne, for example, the likely angle of your landing can be calculated, and the individual shocks preloaded differently to suit.\nRefined on the road\nOn the road, the RHO does a surprisingly good job of not seeming like a total reprobate. The adaptive dampers and rear coil springs can probably be credited for that: Auto mode feels practically refined, and far more supple than you'd expect from a performance truck. Sweeping corners bring none of the pickup lean you might ordinarily predict, and though there's plenty of power, it's easy to modulate with your right foot.\nThe $9,995 Level 1 package certainly doubles-down on that luxe truck persona. That's what adds the leather upholstery with heated, ventilated, and massage front seats; the front passenger touchscreen; dual wireless chargers; and Hands-Free Driving Assist, Ram's equivalent of Super Cruise or BlueCruise for hands-off highway driving. That works surprisingly well for a big vehicle with off-road-ready tires, though I noticed a little slow ping-ponging between the lines (but never over them) on some stretches.\nThough it changes the value equation, it also addresses some outstanding complaints that Ford and Chevy face with their sport truck flagships. You can't get a Raptor or a ZR2 with hands-free driving assistance, for example; the Raptor R's bucket seats are swell, but they won't massage you on a road trip. Ram's argument is clearly that, though performance can mean letting loose off-road, it also means living up to a luxury-level price tag back on the road.\nBig, thirsty, and a bit complicated\nThat's still not to say that the 2025 Ram 1500 RHO is the truck for everyone. Even with a surround-view camera, it's a big pickup and not something you want to be parking in tight lots. The steering may be faster, but the turning circle is definitely large, and you'll be experiencing that navigating your local gas stations frequently, too. Rated at 15 mpg in the city, 21 mpg on the highway, and 17 mpg combined, the RHO is clearly thirsty, and that's assuming you can show some right foot restraint.\nThen there's the dashboard which, with the 1500's sizable 14.5 inch touchscreen taking center stage, can be a little overwhelming. Ram often offers multiple ways to achieve the same thing \u2014 you can choose drive mode through the touchscreen, for instance, or by scrolling through with hard buttons \u2014 but some of the automations rivals have embraced are absent. The useful front-facing camera view automatically appearing when you're perched atop a blind peak (like it does in some other trucks) would be great, as would a physical shortcut key to bring up the cameras.\n2025 Ram 1500 RHO Verdict\nThe usual \"does anybody really need this?\" questions still apply, naturally. Ram doesn't have numbers on just how many of its owners actually tackle off-road situations in a way that might stress the RHO's Baja mode. Honestly, the fact that the RHO's 8,380 pound tow capacity and 1,520 pound payload rating are higher than the old TRX's might make more of a day-to-day difference, even if they're not as sexy statistics as 0-60 times and total horsepower.\nThat might be the 2025 Ram 1500 RHO's secret weapon. Sure, it's a beast if you don't mind getting muddy, and yes, it looks the part with its 88-inch width, more aggressive grille, and squinting full LED projector headlamps. Yet the compromises you might expect to come hand-in-hand with that, like agricultural road manners and a hair-shirt cabin, simply don't appear.\nWhere, as electrification plays an increasing \u2014 and inescapable \u2014 role in Ram's line-up and trucks in general, will that leave beefy boys like the RHO? It's an excellent question, one I don't have the answer to, though the fiendishly clever suspension here does leave me excited at how future electric and hybrid pickups might manage their inevitable weight.\nRam's pitch for the 1500 RHO as best bang-for-buck in horsepower is a good one \u2014 particularly when you remember the TRX is bowing out wearing a whopping $117,625 sticker \u2014 but I can't help but think it misses the point. It's the truck's all-rounder polish that stands out, and if you have budget, appetite, and (hopefully) outlet for its off-road mischief, the Raptors and ZR2s of this world might need to raise their game."

      "text": "Two New Ram 2500 Sport Trucks Are Coming (And Here's How Much They Cost)\nFor the 2026 model year, Ram is introducing the new 2500. To start, it's revealed the specs and price for two sporty models, the Black Express and Warlock. In a press release, Ram notes that the trucks will be available in the third quarter of this year, but you can start your order now.\nSurprisingly, for a heavy-duty truck from an American brand, the prices for the new models really aren't too egregious, hovering under $60,000. That's still a lot of money, but when a lot of heavy-duty trucks (like the ones from General Motors) have no issue getting towards $80,000, or even eclipsing six-figures, under $60,000 is a comparative bargain. To start, the 2026 Ram 2500 Black Express leans into the muscle truck vibe with a two-wheel drive option, and body-colored bumpers. It's available with either a 6.4-liter V8 that generates 405 horsepower, or a 6.7-liter Cummins turbo-diesel engine that generates 1,075 pound-feet of torque for good measure. That truck starts at $53,735, and is available as a package on the base truck for $2,495.\nSporty and thrifty\nRatcheting up the sportiness a bit, the 2026 Ram 2500 Warlock has skid plates, Bilstein shocks, hill-descent control, 34-inch off-road tires, and of course, a big decal that says \"WARLOCK.\" It's a $2,995 package and starts at $57,165. It's also available as a V8 gas-powered truck, or with the Cummins diesel. Oddly, it's actually less expensive than the inline-six powered 2025 Ram 1500 Warlock that SlashGear reviewed last model year, which totaled at $58,240.\nRam is definitely trying something a little different with this new lineup of Ram 2500s. The interiors have cloth bench seats, and not a ton in the way of creature comforts, or driver assistance features, yet the trucks are stylized and equipped in a way that makes them look much more capable than a run-of-the-mill, bone stock work truck. The MSRP says that Ram is cutting costs where it can by keeping the interiors simple and low tech. With car prices continually going up, automakers will have to be creative in keeping prices where customers will actually purchase something. For Ram, it involves a little bit of black magic with the 2500 Warlock."

      "text": "How Much HP And Torque Does A Stock 6.7 Cummins Engine Have? Here Are The Specs\nThe amount of horsepower and torque delivered by a stock 6.7L Cummins diesel engine depends on when it was released. The earliest versions of the 6.7 Cummins diesel, introduced around the middle of the 2007 model year for Dodge Ram pickup trucks, produced 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. It was at that point in time that Cummins ushered in the 6.7 as the replacement for the 5.9 Cummins diesel which had peaked at 325 horsepower and 610 lb-ft of torque.\nBy mid-2013, horsepower ratings for the high output 6.7 Cummins diesel engine had increased to 385, and torque output climbed to 850 lb-ft. The latest iterations, produced after 2021, include standard output (SO) and high output (HO) versions of the 6.7 Cummins diesel. The current standard output 6.7 Cummins diesel puts out 370 horsepower and 850 lb-ft of torque, while the HO version makes 420 horsepower and 1,075 lb-ft of torque.\nIn case you were wondering about the horsepower and torque provided by the 6.7 Cummins gasoline engine, we're happy to report that Cummins rates its 6.7 gasoline engine, the Cummins B6.7 Octane, at 325 horsepower and 660 lb-ft of torque.\nWhat improvements were made to the 6.7 Cummins diesel engines?\nThe original 6.7 Cummins diesel engine features the same inline six-cylinder arrangement and cast-iron construction as the 5.9-liter diesel it replaced. Its 13% larger displacement provided a platform to make more power than the 5.9, and it did so while meeting stricter emissions regulations right from the start.\nThe gains enjoyed by the 2013.5 engine were the result of Cummins' new SCR (Selective Catalyst Reduction) technology and advancements in the engine's fuel and air delivery systems. Those advancements not only improved the 6.7's torque output, but fuel efficiency was also improved by 10%. Plus, the maintenance interval for oil changes was extended to 15,000 miles, doubling the interval of previous Cummins diesel engines.\nSince 2021, Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks have the SO 6.7 Cummins while only the Ram 3500 provides the HO 6.7 option. The most significant difference in the Cummins-provided specs of the two versions is the compression ratio. The SO 6.7 has a compression ratio of 19:1, whereas the HO's ratio is lower at 16.2:1. While the lower compression ratio for the HO 6.7 seems counterintuitive, it allows Cummins to dial up the turbo boost pressures to make more power when needed while keeping emissions in check."

      "text": "Here's What Makes The Dodge Li'l Red Express Truck So Special\nThe OPEC oil crisis in 1973 profoundly impacted the car industry (via NPR). Gasoline rationing forced automakers to shift from land yachts to more efficient vehicles. Events around this same time, such as new emissions laws and tighter safety standards, rattled muscle car production as well. Amid the chaos, Dodge discovered that anything over 6,100 pounds was exempt from the new rules, so they cleverly took advantage of the non-eco-friendly loophole, according to MotorTrend.\nIn 1976 Dodge unveiled its new set of \"Adult Toys.\" Despite the bawdy nomenclature (mind out of the gutter, please), MotorTrend reports this campaign featured four-wheeled American steel with wild names like Warlock, Macho Power Wagon, and Ramcharger. Each one had bold, over-the-top looks, as though a Dodge ad exec noticed the popularity of Hot Wheels and had an ah-ha moment. The \"Adult Toys\" that came out of this line were nothing short of beastly, with the king being the 1978 Li'l Red Express (LRE), yet another classic muscle car worth owning from Dodge.\nAccording to Chrysler engineer Tom Hoover, Li'l Red Express was considered by many as \"The Last American Hot Rod,\" a claim it backed up. A contemporaneous issue of Car and Driver found by MotorTrend said it reached 100 mph in 19.9 seconds, the quickest of the vehicles it tested. Hot Rod magazine said it ran the quarter mile in 14.7 seconds, beating out a Chevy Camaro Z28 in a head-to-head race (via Hagerty).\nI am Dodge, hear me roar\nThe LREs roar was just as bad as its bite. A 1976 issue of Car and Driver magazine noted that at 110 mph cruising speed, the interior noise level hit 94 decibels. That's about the same volume as sitting next to a lawn mower. All that noise came from the very things that caught everyone's attention first \u2014 the beautiful double chrome exhaust stacks just a few feet away from passengers' heads. The LRE was so loud, Dodge couldn't sell it in several states because it exceeded noise restrictions.\nAnd that's where the Midnite Express (ME) comes into the picture. Nearly a replica of the Li'l Red Express, the very rare ME was painted black instead and created for sale in states that didn't allow the LRE, according to MotorBiscuit. It was manufactured for a single year, and only about 200 were produced.\nSince \"Smokey and the Bandit\" was a huge hit at the box office around the same time, it's not a reach to say Dodge was hoping to ride the cachet of Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, and Jerry Reed. The Li'l Red Express was painted in a color Dodge dubbed Bright Canyon Red with chrome exterior trim that twinkled atop distinctive slotted 7-inch wheels in the front and slightly wider 8-inch wheels in the back, according to MotorTrend. The Utiline stepside cargo bed's exterior came with real oak siding, while the deck was lined with pine (via MotorTrend).\nThe Li'l Red Express was the last American factory hot rod\nThe LRE had a 115-inch D150 Adventurer chassis with power steering and a special three-speed automatic transmission. You could get red bucket seats (with convenient center storage) or a bench seat in either red or black. Under the hood lay the heart of the beast \u2014 a 360-cubic-inch (5.9-liter) police-spec V-8 with a four-barrel carburetor and cold-air induction (car tech that is currently banned in some states). It produced 225 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque (via MotorTrend).\nThe MSRP on the LRE in 1978 was \"almost $7,000.\" Dodge initially planned on only making 2,000, but demand was so high it made an additional 188. It was given the go-ahead for production in '79, but the government had since caught on to Dodge's tricks and raised the gross vehicle weight limit to 8,000 pounds, which forced Dodge to put in a catalytic converter, improve exhaust emissions, and use unleaded gasoline for all '79 models. A telling sign of these changes was seen on the speedometer, where the maximum speed was dialed down from 100 mph to 85. A few cosmetic changes included adding quad-headlights and broader front wheels, according to MotorTrend.\nDodge raised the price to $7,500, but despite selling what many considered a downgrade from the original, it still couldn't produce them fast enough \u2014 until a second oil crisis in 1979. Dodge only made 5,118 before the Li'l Red Express finally came to a grinding halt."

      "text": "How Many 2023 Dodge SRT Demons Were Made And Are They Future Collectibles?\nYou can bet the house that Dodge wouldn't settle for anything less upon unveiling the final \"Last Call\" variant of the eponymous Challenger muscle car. After giving customers a vintage giddy vibe with the Shakedown, Swinger, and Black Ghost, the Challenger SRT Demon 170 ends the automaker's penchant for bedazzling, gas-guzzling muscle cars with a record-breaking bang.\nDodge started taking orders for the 2023 Challenger SRT Demon 170 on May 27, 2023. By May 15, Dodge closed the order books and began production of the world's most potent muscle car. By December, production ended at the Brampton Assembly Plant after churning 2,975 SRT Demon 170s for the U.S. and 300 for Canada.\nThe production numbers match the initial estimated 3,300 units for 2023, but what about the remaining 25? As it turns out, 25 Demon 170 Jailbreak variants made their way to the brand's most loyal & selected clientele.\nMotor Trend initially reported that 40 Demon 170 Jailbreaks were available to order (with the shortlist of clients divided between 20 celebrities and 20 new SRT buyers). Still, Mopar Insiders revealed the official numbers at 25 Demon 170 Jailbreak models by 2024, all finished in Pitch Black paint.\nIs the 2023 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 a future collectible?\nIt's not hard to fathom why Mopar enthusiasts and collectors would fall in love with a muscle car like the Demon 170. Equipped with a Hellephant C170 supercharged Hemi V8, the Demon 170 produces 900 horsepower and 810 lb-ft of torque on E10 gas and up to 1,025 horsepower and 945 lb-ft of torque on a steady diet of E85 fuel.\nWith that much power, the Challenger SRT Demon 170 is the quickest Dodge has ever produced, reaching 60 mph in 1.66 seconds while pulling 2.004 gs \u2013 the highest G-force acceleration of any production car. It's also the first to register an NHRA-certified quarter-mile run of 8.91 seconds, making it illegal on a professional dragstrip for not having a roll cage or parachute.\nAnd yet, none of those merits will guarantee that the Challenger SRT Demon 170's value will rise and become a future collectible. However, being the most potent and quickest Dodge muscle car brings something to the table. Consumer preference and economic factors will change as the years go by, but there are indications that the Demon 170 is hitting the right spots.\nWhat makes a future classic car\nIn 2022, Dodge sold the last build slot for the Challenger SRT Demon 170 at auction for $700,000. That's a significant hike from the car's sub-$98,000 base price. Although the auction proceeds are for charity, the limited one-year, 3,300-unit production run and insane horsepower figures of the Demon 170 make it worth considering as a future classic \u2013 including the 25 units of the Demon 170 Jailbreak.\nExperts say a future collectible has a higher chance of raising its value if the car has limited production numbers (or not made every year) and has significantly impacted the industry. Meanwhile, others say a future classic car should have celebrated a milestone for the brand, and being the first to have a particular feature would certainly help.\nHowever, there's one thing that the Challenger SRT Demon 170 has that could guarantee its elevation into future classic car status. It's the last of the breed, the climax of the petrol-fueled Brotherhood of Muscle that started in the 1960s. For instance, a Bugatti Veyron will never be as costly as a Chiron since both are typically the same car, but the latter is faster and has more horsepower.\nBut with the Challenger SRT Demon 170, Mopar fans are assured that there will never be something as fast or as potent. Then again, the Demon 170 is an enthusiast car meant for having fun and burning rubber, so finding a pristine, unmolested unit in the years to come could be challenging (pun intended)."

      "text": "Yes, RAM Is Bringing Back The 5.7 HEMI, But Here's How Much More It'll Cost\nLess than a year after RAM trucks stopped offering the 5.7L HEMI as an engine option on the Ram 1500 lineup, the company has reversed its decision. The Stellantis-owned pickup maker just confirmed that the much-loved V8 engine is making its comeback with the 2026 Ram 1500 models and is already available for order. RAM confirmed that the decision to bring back the 5.7L HEMI was a \"direct result of consumer input\" and that the company \"screwed up\" when it decided to drop the HEMI engine. Besides bringing back the much-loved engine, RAM says it is also working on a product plan that will ensure that its future pickup trucks will have more engine options for customers to choose from.\nIt was in June 2024 that Stellantis abruptly pulled the plug on the 5.7L HEMI as part of moving all the RAM 1500 models to six-cylinder engines, apparently to conform to ever-tightening EPA norms. The company's alternative to the 5.7L HEMI was its new, more powerful, more efficient twin-turbo 3.0L \"Hurricane\" inline six engines.\nDespite being the better engine option on paper, loyal RAM customers were generally unhappy about the decision to discontinue the 5.7L HEMI, spurring much discussion on social media and multiple Reddit threads. This heavy consumer sentiment in favor of the 5.7L HEMI has forced RAM to bring the engine back from the dead.\nWhile RAM hasn't specified the pricing for the 5.7 HEMI variants of the RAM 1500 yet, the company has confirmed that this engine would be offered as a no-charge upgrade on the Limited and Longhorn trims of the vehicle. On the other trims, the engine is an optional upgrade costing $1,200. Also, part of the 5.7L HEMI package is a performance-tuned exhaust and a 33-gallon fuel tank.\n2026 RAM 1500 trims that will get the 5.7 HEMI engine\nThe 2026 model year RAM 1500, which will offer the 5.7 HEMI engine as an option, includes the Tradesman, Big Horn, Express, Warlock, Limited, Longhorn, and Laramie trims. The Rebel trim will also be available with the same engine option, but its availability has been pushed back to a later date. To distinguish the 5.7 HEMI engine-powered models from the other variants of the RAM 1500, the 2026 model year RAM 1500s gets a new, distinctive badge mounted on the vehicle's fender. RAM calls this new badge the \"Symbol of Protest Badge,\" and it showcases a Ram's head pushing forward as if powered by the 5.7 HEMI engine.\nThe 2026 model year 5.7 HEMI is identical to the one that was discontinued earlier. It makes the same 395 hp of power and 410 lb-ft of torque and has nearly the same towing (11,470 pounds) and payload (1,750 pounds) capacity.\nThe only 2026 model year RAM 1500 for which Stellantis has revealed the prices for is the Ram 1500 Express trim, which starts at $44,495 (including destination charge) for the Ram 1500 Express. The standard engine option on this variant is the 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 rated at 305 horsepower, while the 3.0-liter Hurricane engine (420 hp) is an optional $1,695 upgrade.\nStellantis has confirmed that the new 5.7 HEMI-powered 2026 RAM 1500 models will reach dealerships this summer. As mentioned earlier, orders for the 5.7 HEMI-toting model are already open and can be placed via RAM's US website or by visiting a local RAM dealer."

      "text": "2025 Ram 1500 Warlock Review: It's Not The V8 You'll Miss\nGrowing up, I always saw Ram trucks as dependable, hard working, and possessing a slightly goofier side than Fords or Chevys (peaking with silliness like the new 1500 RHO). Embodying that goofiness is the 2025 Ram 1500 Warlock that I was tasked with testing for the week.\nTo give you a peak behind the curtain, I wasn't actually planning on reviewing a Ram truck at all. Instead, it was a last-minute swap, when a much much smaller car succumbed to Pennsylvania roads and popped a tire. It headed back to the dealership, and the only potential replacement was a 2025 Ram 1500 Warlock. Well, the word \"Warlock\" must have tripped a breaker in my brain, because I replied \"I'll take it\" before my brain could fully process what was happening. Something about naming a truck after an evil wizard makes me smile.\nA throwback name\nThe \"Warlock\" moniker is not a new thing for Ram trucks. In the late 1970s, Ram debuted the Warlock along with other iconic trucks like the \"Lil' Red Express.\" Those trucks had an upgraded suspension, a huge and inefficient V8, and all the 1970s pinstriping and graphics you could ever want.\nThe Warlock of 2025 is noticeably more subtle, with only a decal on the bed indicating its skill in the dark arts. Beyond the magic, the Warlock package consists of a lift kit, skid plates, upgraded shocks, some interior infotainment updates, and a locking rear differential. It's a competitor to the Silverado Trail Boss line of trucks and not so much a full-on Toyota TRD treatment. It's still a truck for the street and essentially a Ram 1500 Tradesman at heart. It's a work truck that spent a summer in Isengard getting lessons from Saruman.\nRock you like a Hurricane\nThe engine that powered this Warlock, however, did not bring the eight cylinders of old. As sad as it is, the Chrysler HEMI V8 engine is going the way of the dinosaurs. Now, the Dodge Durango and a select few Ram trucks have the privilege of seeing the engine off to the pearly gates. To replace it, Stellantis debuted a twin-turbocharged inline-six cylinder engine dubbed the \"Hurricane.\" First, it was shown off in the engine bay of the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer; now it's made its way into the Ram truck ecosystem.\nAn optional upgrade on the Warlock, the 3.0-liter Hurricane makes 420 horsepower and 469 pound-feet of torque. Those among us who are perpetually 12 years old when it comes to our sense of humor will find those numbers amusing. That engine is connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission. That all translates to a some serious muscle and speed for the Warlock. It's a fast truck, big mud tires and all.\nLearning the dark arts\nAs I discovered during a particularly brisk drive to emergency dental surgery two days before Christmas, the Warlock has a lot of room under the pedal. While I did my best to arrive safely and abide by any all traffic laws, I will say that I have a new personal best time to get to the dentist.\nWhile I wasn't dealing with tooth pain, the Warlock was actually a dream to drive. It's not as much of a hassle as other off-road trucks tend to be, and while I wish it had running boards to assist climbing into the cabin, there was a surprising lack of road noise coming from the tires. They refused to balk at snowy weather, and I felt the truck was confident enough (and powerful enough) to handle adverse conditions with aplomb. Given that it's by nature a huge truck, parking in crowded parking lots could be a pain, and it has the turn radius of a planet. That, sadly, just comes with the territory.\nThe downsides of wizardry\nPowertrain wise, I have exactly zero complaints. HEMI diehards may bemoan the new six-cylinder, but I found the power delivery to be extremely smooth (as is the case with many inline-six engines), and there was absolutely enough power on tap. I didn't find it lacking in any particular way, as opposed to some of the HEMI V8s I have driven.\nThat praise is punctuated with a few complaints about the Warlock's interior. It's about as austere as you can get: manually-adjusted, non-heated cloth seats; no media buttons on the steering wheel to speak of; a very barebones sound system; and a very basic climate control system. That might be selling point to a few people as it's \"less stuff to break,\" but in a nearly $60,000 truck, I'd expect a few more creature comforts. All that said, I didn't find the Warlock uncomfortable to drive, and the interior was entirely adequate, I just needed to calibrate my muscle memory to behave as if I was in a truck from 2005 and not 2025.\nYou'd think that dropping a pair of cylinders and using forced induction would benefit fuel economy, and it does, but only slightly. The Warlock's engine has an insatiable hunger for gasoline at an estimated combined 19 miles per gallon, and while that seems fairly good for a full-size truck, good luck actually getting that number because you will want to thrash the Warlock at any given opportunity. I depleted the fuel tank twice over the six days that I was under the Warlock's spell.\nThe price to pay\nFor some dark magic in the form of a 2025 Ram 1500 Warlock, there is a price to pay (your soul's price may vary). The Ram 1500 Tradesman starts at $46,875. That gets you, you know, the truck. The Warlock package, referred to by the much less catchy name of the $4,690 \"Customer Preferred Package 21B\" adds your beefy off-road tires, 18-inch wheels, the aforementioned rear locking differential and skid plates over every conceivable surface, a power sliding rear window, tow hooks, rubber floor mats, and off course, the Warlock decal.\nThe Hurricane engine is a $2,695 option. Additionally, this truck had a spray in bedliner and a few external niceties like a bed step for $945. The \"Forged Metallic Blue\" paint is $295. The 3.92 rear axle is $195 (bumping the tow rating in this CrewCab 4x4 version from 8,240 pounds to 11,340 pounds), joining the $550 tonneau cover for the 5'7 bed. All that and the $1,995 destination charge gets you to a $58,240 dark wizard of a truck.\n2025 Ram 1500 Warlock Verdict\nComparatively, $60,000 for an off-road ready truck isn't terrible, especially considering the fact that trucks can easily spiral toward six-figure pricing at the drop of a hat these days. I just wish that more time was spent on the interior, making it a slightly nicer place to be when you're raiding Hogwarts or Gondor.\nRam will supply extra interior amenities, naturally, in return for making the price go higher. That might be a tradeoff you're willing to make, if you value interior comfort over thriftiness. Then again, simply buying a truck with a huge \"WARLOCK\" decal on the bed arguably indicates that making prudent financial decisions aren't at the top of your priority list. Otherwise, you would just buy a Prius.\nI liked the Warlock. It's a fun truck to drive and it's a riot under the right conditions. The real wizardry at play is its combination of a stout engine, an off-road package that doesn't sacrifice street-usability in favor of bouncy nonsense, and a price that isn't outrageous. I just wish the warlocks over at Stellantis hadn't cast a disappearing spell on all the interior gadgets and all the fuel in the gas tank."
