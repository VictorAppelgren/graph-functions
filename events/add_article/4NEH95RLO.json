      "summary": "Amazon’s U.S. Prime membership sign‑ups fell short of last year’s totals and the company’s own targets, with 5.4 million new members over the 21‑day period surrounding Prime Day—a roughly 2% decline from 2023. The internal data, revealed by Reuters, shows a 116,000‑member shortfall versus the prior year and a 106,000 miss against Amazon’s goal. Despite record sales during the four‑day event, the subscription growth trend remains weaker than expected, raising concerns about post‑event momentum and competition from rivals such as Walmart.",
