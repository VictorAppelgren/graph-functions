  "title": "With the S&P 500 at Historically High Levels, This ETF Could Be the Best Way to Invest in the Index",
  "description": "The index has been on a roll, but will the party continue for much longer?",
  "content": "\u2022 Despite recent ups and downs, the S&P 500 is trading at historically high levels.\n\u2022 The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks account for around a third of the S&P 500.\n\u2022 An equal-weight S&P 500 ETF invests about evenly among companies in the index.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF \u203a\n\nThe S&P 500 has long been the stock market's most followed and important index. Tracking 500 of the largest American companies on the market, it's often used to gauge the health of the U.S. economy and market. After the index declined by over 19% in 2022, it has experienced a bull run, with its levels increasing by over 68% since the start of 2023. That's the good news.\n\nThe \"we should keep an eye on that\" news is that now the S&P 500 is trading at historically high levels. Based on its Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- which measures stock prices against inflation-adjusted average earnings over the past 10 years -- the S&P 500 is trading at levels we haven't seen in quite some time. And unfortunately, anytime the index has reached these levels, sharp declines soon followed.\n\nFor investors interested in investing in the S&P 500, its extremely high valuation may be alarming. However, there is another way to invest in the index that could possibly hedge against a sudden pullback. And that's via an S&P 500 equal-weight ETF like the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT: RSP).\n\nThe difference between the standard S&P 500 and equal-weight S&P 500\n\nThe standard S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, so larger companies account for more of the index than smaller companies. In the equal-weight S&P 500, each company accounts for roughly the same amount.\n\nHistorically, being weighted by market hasn't been an issue for the S&P 500, but as megacap tech stocks have exploded in valuation over the past couple of years, a handful of companies are now worth a large portion of the index. The Magnificent Seven stocks -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla -- now account for over a third of the index. In the equal-weight S&P 500, they only account for 2.18%.\n\nThe high concentration in a handful of tech stocks has worked out well for the S&P 500, given the artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled run they have been on; however, as the saying goes, \"the same thing that makes you laugh, makes you cry.\" Pullbacks in these stocks, or the tech sector as a whole, will significantly weigh down the index.",

      "text": "Broadly speaking, a bull market is a sustained period -- usually months or years -- when prices rise. The term is most commonly used in reference to the stock market, but other asset classes can have bull markets as well, such as real estate, commodities, or foreign currencies.\nWhat exactly is a bull market?\nWhat exactly is a bull market?\nUsually, a bull market marks a 20% rise in stock prices, which follows a previous 20% decline and is followed by another 20% decline. As you can see from the chart below, there was a bull market that began in 2003 and ended when the S&P 500 hit its peak in 2007.\nBut there's one important caveat: The dates of a bull market can only be known in retrospect.\nCharacteristics of a bull market\nCharacteristics of a bull market\nThere are several things that tend to accompany a bull market. For starters, they generally happen during periods when the economy is strong or strengthening. Bull markets are often accompanied by gross domestic product (GDP) growth and falling unemployment, and companies' profits will be on the rise.\nAdditionally, one of the best non-numerical indicators for a bull market is rising investor confidence. During these times, there is a strong overall demand for stocks, and the general \"tone\" of market commentary tends to be positive. And, because companies can get higher valuations for their equity, we tend to see high levels of initial public offering, or IPO, activity in bull markets.\nThe opposite of a bull market is a bear market, which is typically defined as stocks falling by 20% or more from a recent peak. Bear markets are often accompanied by recessions, falling investor confidence, and declines in corporate profits.\nLearn more: Bull vs. Bear Market\nHow to invest in a bull market\nHow to invest in a bull market\nRegardless of what the market is doing, you should maintain a long-term focus to cultivate long-term wealth. While it can be a smart idea to invest when stocks are cheap, it's unwise to try to time the market. Great long-term businesses can be found in any market.\nOne smart thing to do is learn the principle of dollar-cost averaging. This involves investing equal dollar amounts at specific time intervals, which can help you invest during a bull market while allowing your portfolio to benefit from corrections and crashes as well.\nHistoric bull markets\nHistoric bull markets\nAs an example, consider the 2009-2020 bull market, which was the longest in stock market history. After plunging as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, the S&P 500 bottomed out in March 2009 and then proceeded to climb until early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic sent stocks crashing.\nRelated investing topics\nPrior to the latest one, there was a lengthy bull market that lasted from 2002 until the late-2007 bear market that coincided with the financial crisis. The bottom line is that bull markets tend to be several years in length and are always preceded by and ended by bear markets."

      "text": "The price-to-earnings ratio, also known as the P/E ratio, is one of the most commonly used stock valuation metrics, and it is important for any investor to understand. In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at what the P/E ratio is, how to calculate it, and how to use it as part of your investment analysis.\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nThe P/E ratio, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a metric that compares a company\u2019s net income to its stock price. It can be an excellent tool when analyzing stocks and can help investors get a sense of whether a stock is a good value or expensive.\nAs the name implies, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the current share price of a stock and dividing by its earnings per share over a one-year period. For example, if a stock trades for $40 per share and earned $2 per share in the past year, its P/E ratio would be 20.\nYou may hear the P/E ratio also referred to as the P/E multiple or earnings multiple, and it\u2019s important to realize that these terms are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing.\nThere are several different ways to calculate the P/E ratio, with the two most common being the trailing P/E and the forward P/E. A stock\u2019s trailing P/E is calculated by using its past four quarters\u2019 earnings, while the forward P/E is calculated by using the consensus projections, or the company\u2019s own guidance, for the next 12 months of earnings.\nWhy is P/E ratio important?\nWhy is the P/E ratio important?\nThe P/E ratio is important because it is a valuation metric that is useful for comparing different investment opportunities to one another. It can be a useful tool when trying to identify undervalued stocks, and it can help you avoid overpaying for stocks as well.\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nThe most effective way to use the P/E ratio is to compare the valuations of businesses in the same industry at similar stages of maturity. For example, you might use the P/E ratio as part of an analysis comparing Target (TGT -0.85%), Costco (COST -0.23%), and Walmart (WMT 0.88%).\nIt is also worth pointing out that the P/E ratio doesn\u2019t work on companies that aren\u2019t profitable. There are other valuation metrics that can be applied to early-stage growth companies, but the P/E ratio isn\u2019t one of them.\nNo valuation metric can tell you if a stock is an attractive investment opportunity all by itself, and the P/E ratio is no exception. For example, the stock of a faster-growing business should have a higher P/E ratio than a slower-growing one, all other factors being equal. So the P/E ratio is best used as one piece of the puzzle, in combination with earnings growth, cash and debt levels, gross and net profit margins, and other figures.\nFinally, if a stock has a P/E ratio that is much lower than its peers, it can be a red flag that is worthy of further investigation. Companies with P/E ratios that seem too good to be true often have declining sales, poor balance sheet quality, or another underlying reason for the seemingly cheap valuation.\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nLet\u2019s take a look at a real-world example of calculating the P/E ratio. As of Feb. 6, 2023, Apple (AAPL -0.19%) traded for $154.50. Over the past four quarters, Apple earned $5.90 per share. So we can calculate its trailing P/E ratio as follows:\nSo Apple trades for 26.2 times its trailing-12-month earnings. If we wanted a more forward-looking metric, we can use Apple\u2019s projected earnings over the next 12 months, which are $6.23 per share. If we use this, our forward earnings calculation looks like:\nNow let\u2019s say that you\u2019re trying to decide between Apple and Microsoft (MSFT -0.65%). On the same date, Microsoft traded for $255.12. Its trailing-12-month earnings were $8.99 per share, so its trailing P/E ratio could be calculated as:\nApple\u2019s trailing P/E is 26.2, while Microsoft\u2019s is 28.4. Based on the P/E ratio alone, Apple appears to be the cheaper stock. However, as mentioned above, it\u2019s important to understand the P/E ratio is just one metric that should be used in stock analysis and doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nSo when conducting an analysis of two companies like this, the best practice is to use the P/E ratio along with other metrics for both companies to develop a thorough comparison of the two investment opportunities."

It is used as a valuation metric to forecast future returns, where a higher CAPE ratio could reflect lower returns over the next couple of decades, whereas a lower CAPE ratio could reflect higher returns over the next couple of decades, as the ratio reverts back to the mean. |\n| Report | Shiller S&P 500 PE 10 |\n| Category | Market Indices and Statistics |\n| Region | United States |\n| Source | Robert Shiller |\nStats\n| Last Value | 37.87 |\n| Latest Period | Aug 2025 |\n| Last Updated | Aug 8 2025, 19:01 EDT |\n| Next Release | Sep 8 2025, 19:00 EDT (E) |\n| Average Growth Rate | 1.53% |\n| Value from Last Month | 37.78 |\n| Change from Last Month | 0.24% |\n| Value from 1 Year Ago | 34.92 |\n| Change from 1 Year Ago | 8.44% |\n| Frequency | Monthly |\n| Adjustment | N/A |\n| Download Source File | Upgrade |\nRelated Indicators\n| S&P 500 Fundamentals |\n| S&P 500 Dividend Yield | 1.25% |\n| S&P 500 Earnings Yield | 3.86% |\n| S&P 500 Market Cap | 52.50T USD |\n| S&P 500 P/E Ratio | 25.90 |\n| S&P 500 Price to Book Ratio | 4.688 |\n| SPX Put/Call Ratio | 1.18 |\n| VIX | 15.36 |"

  "argos_summary": "The S&P 500 is trading at historically high levels, largely driven by the Magnificent Seven tech giants that now make up over a third of the index. While the market has rallied 68% since early 2023, the steep Shiller CAPE ratio signals potential downside risk. An equal\u2011weight S&P 500 ETF, such as Invesco RSP, offers a more diversified exposure that could mitigate a pullback from the concentrated tech sector. The article also explains the mechanics of bull markets, the importance of valuation metrics like P/E, and cautions that sharp declines often follow peaks.",
