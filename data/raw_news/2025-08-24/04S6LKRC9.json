  "description": "Dongfeng Motor Group Co.\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares surged the most in six months after the Chinese automaker announced long-awaited restructuring plans that will se\u2026",
  "content": "The restructuring, announced late Friday, involves withdrawing its Hong Kong shares and creating a new listing for its Voyah line of luxury new-energy vehicles. The deal has a theoretical value of HK$10.85 per share, according to the company.\n\nThe overhaul follows a signal from the State Council in March that consolidation among China\u2019s state-owned automakers would help boost competitiveness. Dongfeng, along with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. and China FAW Group have been caught flatfooted by the rapid rise of homegrown EV firms like BYD Co. as consumers eschew the foreign brands that are core to the state-owned carmakers\u2019 operations.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\n\u201cThis proposed transaction is clearly a move where the Chinese government, as well as Dongfeng Motor management, aim to unlock the hidden value of the company,\u201d JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Nick Lai wrote in a note. \u201cThe company has consistently been trading at a significant discount to book value, while cash and equivalents are nearly twice as big\u201d as its market capitalization, they wrote.\n\nThe Voyah brand was launched in 2020 and although it only accounts for about 7% of Dongfeng\u2019s deliveries, it has seen fast growth in sales \u2014 increasing 86% in the first seven months this year to 66,680 units. The Honda joint venture sold 173,373 cars in the same period, a drop of 31% year-on-year.\n\nThe restructure would give Voyah a valuation of 36.8 billion yuan ($5.1 billion) to 41.88 billion yuan, Morgan Stanley analysts including Joey Xu and Tim Hsiao wrote in a note. That compares with 31.8 billion yuan for Avatr \u2014 the premium EV range that counts Changan and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. as major shareholders \u2014 though Voyah booked fewer losses than Avatr in 2024, they wrote.\n\nThe carmaker and Changan were in talks about a potential merger, the New York Times reported in April, citing people familiar with the matter. But in July, a new government entity became controlling shareholder of Changan, making it one of three automakers directly controlled by Beijing, along with Dongfeng and FAW Group.",

The move follows a State Council push for consolidation among state\u2011owned automakers to better compete with domestic EV leaders like BYD.

The restructuring is part of a broader effort to unlock hidden value in Dongfeng, which has traded at a discount to book value, and comes amid ongoing talks of a potential merger with Changan, now controlled by a new government entity.",
