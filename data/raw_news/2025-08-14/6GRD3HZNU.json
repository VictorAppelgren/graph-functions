  "title": "Trump's beef with economic data could backfire",
  "description": "Economists and economic data collectors have become the target of Trump's attacks with the president firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after a disappointing jobs report as he continues to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman breaks down the details. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.",
  "content": "President Trump may be coming for the data keepers and economists. But to what end? Our senior economist Rick Newman joins me now to discuss his latest story, Rick, to what end?\n\nI think what Trump's trying to do here is create an alternative economic narrative. And um, you know, Trump does have a few serious economic people in his orbit. Scott Bessette, the Treasury secretary, he understands markets, he understands the economy.\n\nKevin Hassett's got his PhD in economics.\n\nYes, he does. Uh, there are a few others. And um, you know, they, they must know the same thing all the other economists know. We're talking hundreds of economists now who are basically in unison saying we're going to get a slowing economy from the tariffs, we're going to get less hiring, we're going to get a hit to corporate profit margins. Some of this is starting to show up in the data. So what has Trump's reaction been so far? When he fired the, uh, the economist who oversees the jobs report, she also oversaw the inflation report. He's nominated this other guy who's a conservative economist. He's putting his guy, Stephen Moore, into one of the temporary spots on the Federal Reserve policy committee.\n\nYep, and Tony for for BLS. Um, he's always raking J. Powell, Fed chair, over the coals. So I think what Trump is doing here is anticipating. I mean, he's probably got his economists telling him, we are going to see a deterioration in the economic data, not necessarily depression, but we're going to see negative trends. And he's trying to create this other storyline, which is, oh, things are actually much better. Let's, you know, his his nominee for the Labor Department, for the Labor Department jobs suggested we should just stop publishing the jobs report for a few months. Why not forever? Now, I don't think, uh, Trump's alternative narrative on the economy is going to work. I mean, you can't really fool markets, and there's a lot of data in the private sector. But we are getting this battle of the economists shaping up.\n\nI think it's interesting too, Rick, just on this point about economic data. But when the PPI data hits this morning, you do have these questions being raised, and you'll hear them. Whether you trust the data, whether you have confidence in the data. It is, it is a question that's raised more now. I, I wonder, let me put you like this, do you, not whether you trust the data, but do you think there's room to, for example, rethink BLS data or BLS methodology given the revisions we see?\n\nWell, there have been methodological problems for a long time, and some of those are getting worse. Um, but I think about this in two ways. Number one, the data that we're seeing so far, you know, it gets revised, it gets a little bit better, a little bit worse. That's a normal thing. The data we're seeing so far basically is exactly what you would expect to happen if you impose a new 18% tariff on $3 trillion worth of imported goods. You make stuff more expensive, it is going to have effects throughout the economy. Number one. So what we're seeing, it does make sense. I mean, it's logical. Number two, um, ordinary people, voters and consumers, they're not sitting at home saying, oh, the PPI was 3.9 or 3.1 or 2.9, is it up? They, they, they don't pay attention to most of this stuff almost all the time. What they pay attention to is what is, what are groceries cost on store shelves, they care about gasoline, and that's in their favor right now. Gas prices are down. But they care about, are they getting ahead at work, are there job opportunities? Do they hear about layoffs? Do they see layoffs happening in their community? You know, one person gets laid off in a, in a, in a small town, and everybody knows it. Five people get laid off and that town is in a recession. So, uh, these things are likely to start happening. I'm not predicting a recession. I don't think that's what most economists are saying right now. But Trump has a problem with the economy, and you, you can't just make up your own statistics and try to convince voters that they're better off than they are.",

  "summary": "President Trump's focus on economic data may be to create an alternative economic narrative, according to senior economist Rick Newman. He argues that hundreds of economists are predicting a slowing economy from tariffs, decreased hiring, and a hit to corporate profit margins due to this. Trump's reaction to this has included the firing of the economist who oversaw the jobs report and overseeing inflation reports. He also nominated conservative economist Stephen Moore for a temporary spot on the Federal Reserve policy committee. Newman argues that this strategy could not work as markets and voters are more concerned about job opportunities, wages, and job losses. However, Newman acknowledges that the data so far is consistent with what consumers care about.",

  "argos_summary": "President Trump appears to be attempting to create an alternative narrative regarding the economy, potentially in response to anticipated negative trends from tariffs and economic data. Despite having some knowledgeable economists in his circle, many experts predict a slowing economy, which Trump seems to be countering by reshuffling economic leadership and questioning the validity of economic reports. The discussion highlights the disconnect between economic data and public perception, as everyday concerns about job security and living costs may overshadow statistical measures.",
