  "content": "The New York Jets will have to navigate the rest of the preseason without their backup quarterback, but the team is holding out hope that it will be at full strength behind center by Week 1.\n\nTyrod Taylor underwent arthroscopic knee surgery and will continue to remain out through the rest of the exhibition slate, Jets coach Aaron Glenn said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\n\"He's still going through his protocols as far as his rehab, so we'll see exactly where he is in the next couple weeks,\" Glenn said.\n\nTaylor, 36, is expected to provide a veteran presence behind Justin Fields, whom the team signed to a two-year, $40 million contract in March.\n\nAs Aaron Rodgers' backup in 2024, the 14-year veteran appeared in two games and completed 17 of 22 passing attempts for 119 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nFields, who completed three of four passes for 34 yards and ran for a touchdown in last week's preseason opener against the Green Bay Packers, said earlier in the month he hoped he would play alongside the first-string offense in each preseason contest.\n\nThe Jets open the season on Sept. 7 against Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWith Taylor out, undrafted rookie Brady Cook and 2024 United Football League MVP Adrian Martinez could be in line for extensive work in the remaining two preseason games, with the next tilt coming Saturday against the New York Giants.\n\nHere's the way the Jets QBs are listed:",

      "text": "Justin Fields contract details: Jets ink QB to lucrative two-year deal\nThe New York Jets decided early in the offseason they were moving on from veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers after a disappointing two-season partnership.\nThe Jets landed their replacement for Rodgers in the early hours of NFL free agency: former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.\nFields posted his most efficient season to date with the Steelers in 2024 despite starting just six games. He completed a career-high 65.8% of his passes for 1,106 yards, five touchdowns and an interception during the season while adding 289 yards and five touchdowns on 62 carries.\nNew Jets coach Aaron Glenn faced Fields often when both were in the NFC North. Fields often ran roughshod over the Detroit Lions defense while with the Chicago Bears, which may have played a factor in New York's decision to sign the potential-packed quarterback to a lucrative contract.\nHere's what to know about Fields' deal with the Jets and how it compares to those of his peers.\nJustin Fields contract details\nFields signed a two-year deal with the Jets worth up to $40 million. Below are the full details of Fields' contract, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport:\n- Term: 2 years\n- Total value: $40 million\n- Average annual value (AAV): $20 million\n- Guaranteed money: $30 million\nFields' $20 million in average annual ranks just 21th in the NFL for 2025, per OverTheCap.com, when including Sam Darnold's three-year, $100.5 million contract with the Seattle Seahawks. Fields will move up to 20th if and when the Jets release Rodgers, but still, they will be paying far less in AAV to Fields than Rodgers ($37.5 million).\nThe total value of Fields' contract will also rank 21st in the NFL, though that could change if a quarterback like Cam Ward or Shedeur Sanders goes with one of the first two picks in the 2025 NFL draft. The No. 1 pick is set to make just over $43 million over his deal in 2025 while the second pick will make $41.4 million, per Spotrac.com.\nThe No. 3 overall pick will only make $39.9 million, however, so Fields doesn't figure to move too far off his 21st rank in total contract value."
