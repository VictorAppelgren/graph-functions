      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but still falls short of a world‑class scenario analysis. To bring it up to the required standard, 1) anchor every claim to a source ID (e.g., “Japan wage growth 3‑4 % (A7VLN74BK)”), 2) replace vague statements (“consumer sentiment is gravitating toward budget‑friendly products”) with concrete data (e.g., “Douglas tires average lifespan 40‑60 k miles, 50 k‑mile warranty (V8TEZOR8R)”), 3) explicitly map the causal chain: tight labor → wage growth → disposable income → demand for low‑cost goods → productivity gains from AI/UAS → lower prices, and show path‑dependency (e.g., “if UAS hiring stalls, wage‑price spiral may slow”). 4) structure a 3–6 month scenario map with clear triggers (e.g., “Fed rate hike > 0.25 pp” or “Japan wage index > 3 %”) and invalidations (e.g., “global supply‑chain shock reduces UAS output”), and include timing windows (e.g., “Q4 2025 Fed meeting”). 5) add a base case (moderate inflation 2‑3 %, wage growth 3‑4 % Japan, 5‑6 % US, AI productivity 1‑2 % YoY), one upside (AI breakthrough cuts costs 5 % → consumer confidence ↑) and one downside (credit tightening → UAS hiring drop). 6) quantify flows: UAS jobs 712→1,400 (FOM34PUWA), average salary $105,912, UAS sector GDP share, consumer spending on budget tires (price $50‑$120, volume X). 7) include watch‑list signals: Fed minutes, Japan wage index releases, UAS hiring data, consumer price index, Barista FIRE job‑market sentiment. 8) state confidence (e.g., “moderate (70 %)”) and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., AUVSI’s defunct projections vs. EDC’s 97 % rise). 9) ensure every paragraph ends with a clear link to the next causal step, and avoid generic platitudes. Implement these edits and your analysis will meet the depth, clarity, and rigor expected for a 3–6 month horizon scenario.",
