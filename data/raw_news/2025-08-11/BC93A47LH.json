  "title": "Signs of Trump\u2019s takeover of D.C. policing are in view, with more to come",
  "description": "Federal officers have begun approaching homeless campsites and policing graffiti. Large shifts of National Guard troops were expected by the end of the week.",
  "content": "Trump promised much more to come. He said his initiative would inject \u201can overwhelming presence\u201d into D.C., with seven federal agencies expanding their reach into city life. The Drug Enforcement Administration began sending agents to homeless campsites. U.S. Park Police was tasked with addressing graffiti in federal parks. National Guard troops were expected to staff intersections and work in shifts of 200 starting later this week. Trump said that more than 500 federal agents were deployed last week, and that the effort will eventually be supplemented by another 800 troops from the D.C. National Guard.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have more police and you\u2019ll be so happy because you\u2019ll be safe when you walk down the street,\u201d Trump said at his Monday morning news conference. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see police, or you\u2019re going to see FBI agents \u2014 going to have a lot of agents on the street \u2014 and you\u2019re going to have a lot of, essentially military.\u201d\n\nTrump named Terry Cole, the head of the DEA, as his interim commissioner of the D.C. police. Cole told Police Chief Pamela A. Smith on Monday evening that the federal team is hoping for the Metro Police Department to lead the effort, according to a police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCole described Trump\u2019s takeover of the department as more of a collaboration and he stressed that they would continue to meet and work together to figure out where to deploy resources, the official said.\n\nWashington boasts more city officers per capita than any other large city in the country, according to the FBI\u2019s latest figures. There are nearly five D.C. police officers per 1,000 residents, ahead of New York, Chicago, Detroit and Baltimore. The figure does not include the agencies deployed by Trump nor the droves of other officers with agencies that have some jurisdiction in the District, including the U.S. Capitol Police, Metro Transit Police, Supreme Court police, Amtrak police and numerous others.\n\nSmith said additional federal policing resources could be helpful to the District in executing warrants or deploying more officers to areas of the city where D.C. police patrol \u2014 including to U Street alongside the nightlife task force, to Drug Free Zones, to areas with juvenile curfews and to neighborhoods where violent crime is highest.\n\n\u201cWhat you will see is an enhanced presence,\u201d Smith said, adding that after Trump\u2019s announced takeover Monday morning, she spent an hour on the phone with the U.S. Marshals discussing how federal resources will be deployed in the city. She said she had more meetings later Monday to further sketch out how to deploy resources.\n\n\u201cPeople still have their constitutional rights. This is not suspending that,\u201d Alicia Yass, supervising policy council for the ACLU of D.C., said in an interview. \u201cSo, if police or other law enforcement do approach people in a public place, they still have a right to remain silent.\u201d\n\nAl, a 50-year-old man living on a discarded couch under Georgetown\u2019s Whitehurst Freeway, said he was a burning citronella candle to keep away the mosquitos on Sunday when he was approached by DEA agents in flak jackets. Al, who declined to give his last name for privacy reasons, said he has lived on the street for decades and struggled with addiction, but was familiar with police activity in D.C. He has been removed from at least five encampments in as many years.",
