      "feedback": "Overall, the draft correctly centers the tariff-regime map and Nvidia AI momentum as the dominant cross‑topic drivers and ties inflation dynamics to policy, valuations, and real rates, but it needs a crisper, testable structure and tighter grounding to reach world‑class quality; actionable edits below should be implemented in a single integrated paragraph in the next revision: (1) harden the causal chain by laying out a stepwise mechanism from tariff regime (Regime A) to domestic capital expenditure and productivity uplift, to supply‑side inflation and real rates, to risk premia and equity valuations, with explicit quantitative links drawn from SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F, OGK8WLL69, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ; (2) replace vague phrasing with first‑principles framing for discount rates and risk premia (e.g., neutral real rate, inflation expectations, and term premium) and show how Regime shifts translate into P/E/WACC adjustments and S&P upside/downside paths; (3) strengthen scenario structure into three explicit, numerically bounded regimes with defined probabilities, asset implications (equities vs defensives vs cyclicals), and clear invalidation triggers (e.g., CPI MoM surprises outside 0.30–0.40% path, wage growth momentum exceeding thresholds, tariff escalations beyond stated levels, or a capex cadence that disappoints); (4) quantify links using the source ranges (tariffs 10% baseline, reciprocity up to 34%, spikes to 145%; oil path around Brent mid‑60s, WTI low‑60s; core CPI MoM 0.30–0.40% path) and translate them into concrete numbers (range bands for S&P, earnings margins, and discount rates) rather than qualitative statements; (5) tighten the watch‑list to 4–6 decisive signals with explicit thresholds (e.g., CPI prints, wage growth pace, Jackson Hole policy tone, semiconductor capex cadence, tariff announcements, oil-supply surprises, and 10Y yield moves) and map each to a Regime risk: A softening inflation surprise → regime drift toward easing, a persistent inflation path → regime B/C risk; (6) harmonize terminology across drivers (Regime A/B/C vs Regime I) and reconcile potential conflicts (e.g., oil regime vs inflation path) by stating where sources agree and where ranges reflect uncertainty, with citations tightly anchored to IDs (SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F, OGK8WLL69, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ, Y6SQOEK69, NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360) and no extraneous claims; (7) tighten length and style to a compact 180–230 word synthesis that preserves a concise cross‑topic synthesis plus a crisp watch‑list, ensuring every factual claim has a source anchor.",
