  "content": "Keke Palmer has no time for mom guilt \u2014 especially not in this economy.In an interview with Parents published on Wednesday, the actor spoke about the realities of being a single working mom. Palmer has one son, Leodis \"Leo\" Andrellton Jackson, with her ex-boyfriend, Darius Jackson.\"Don't feel guilt,\" Palmer said. \"Your child is your child because you were meant to be their parent. And as a working parent, it could be really, really hard because you're wondering like, 'Damn, is this good for me and my child?' But the reality is, if you got to work, you got to work.\"The Emmy award-winning actor also said that mothers shouldn't feel guilty about receiving help from others when it comes to caring for their child \"because it takes a village.\"\"I think that's important, and especially in this economy where everybody's got to go to work,\" she said.In addition to acting, Palmer has hosted the NBC game show \"Password\" since 2022 and leads her own podcast, \"Baby, This is Keke.\" In June, she also released her latest album, \"Just Keke.\"Even with a packed schedule, Palmer says motherhood gives her the perspective she needs to keep going.\"I think a lot of times you can feel like you got to do this, or you got to do that,\" Palmer said, adding that it can be especially challenging in the industry she works in. \"But when you have a child that needs you, it's easier for you to prioritize what is best for your sense of self.\"Palmer isn't the only celebrity mom who has spoken about mom guilt and the struggles of juggling work and parenting.In August 2024, Blake Lively said she feels guilty whenever she has to choose between work and family commitments.\"When you're working, sometimes you feel guilty for, you know, not being in your personal life in those hours you're at work,\" Lively said. \"And then when you're at work, you feel guilty by being distracted by wishing that you were at your personal life.\"In May, Michelle Williams said that balancing her career and motherhood is like figuring out \"which master you're going to serve.\"\"Because the truth is, if work is going well, somebody else is taking care of the kids. And if you're in a high point with your kids, the work is shoved to the side,\" Williams said.A representative for Palmer did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.",
