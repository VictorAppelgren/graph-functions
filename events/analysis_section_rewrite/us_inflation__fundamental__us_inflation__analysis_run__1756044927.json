Quantify the regime inputs with concrete numbers: tariff‑driven purchasing‑power impact around $3,800 per household per year; Ford’s forward P/E ~10.3 and dividend ~5.18% with Q2 EV losses and 4.3% adj operating margin; UNH/LULU long‑horizon moats with FCF yields >9% and forward multiples near 13.5x; LULU’s 13.5x forward and its lowered guidance; Donegal’s dividend trend since 2020; Douglas Tires’ budget vs premium trade‑offs and typical 40k–60k mile life; and the mispricing signals from Burry’s moves in UNH and LULU (IGP1Q4ZEJ). Then replace the current blended narrative with a four‑regime map (tariff/price‑shock inflation regime; EV profitability transition regime for autos; moat durability regime for health/insurance; consumer‑durable cyclicality regime) with explicit transition conditions and a concise base case, plus catalysts and invalidation triggers: tariff updates and inflation prints as near‑term catalysts; earnings revisions and balance‑sheet resilience for UNH/LULU/Ford as medium‑term tests; DOJ/regulatory or margin deterioration risks as invalidation points; watch the 13F/earnings signals for regime shifts (W2622L6WW; IGP1Q4ZEJ; TN66GHPAT; JHGBQ4TQH). Ensure the prose uses cross‑source consistency, trims non‑essential syntheses, and explicitly reconciles conflicts (tariff‑driven inflation vs. disciplined capital allocation; Ford as income play vs. EV profitability risk; UNH/LULU as moats vs. near‑term earnings risk). Present a tight base‑case trajectory grounded in those anchors, plus a concise list of forward catalysts and clear invalidation conditions, with citations placed immediately after the material they support: (YVQU6QCY4) (W2622L6WW) (IGP1Q4ZEJ) (TN66GHPAT) (JHGBQ4TQH) and the total‑return/ROIC scaffolds (W2622L6WW; TN66GHPAT). This reframe will remove generic storytelling and deliver a structurally sound, scenario‑rich, numbers‑driven view over multi‑year horizons.",
