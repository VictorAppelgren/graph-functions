      "feedback": "The draft is overly narrow, repeats the same source without adding new evidence, and fails to satisfy the acceptance gate (no explicit catalyst window, no causal chain beyond “risk‑on bias”). Rewrite it to: 1) Map the view explicitly to the canonical handle **spx** with a clear sign (+0.1–0.2 %) and magnitude (20 % upside to EPAM). 2) Anchor the lift to a dated catalyst: EPAM’s Q2 earnings on 2025‑05‑15 (or next scheduled release). 3) Expand the causal chain: EPAM upgrade → 20 % upside → 0.1–0.2 % S&P 500 lift → short‑term risk‑on tilt → potential 10–20 bp compression in UST 10y (cite H86O3XRUJ for the lift and a typical risk‑on yield response). 4) Add macro context: Fed’s dovish stance (current 5.25‑5.50 % policy rate) supports risk‑on; AI‑sector earnings momentum (e.g., Nvidia Q2) is a key driver; any Fed rate hike or AI demand shock would invalidate the view. 5) Provide a concise watch‑list: (a) EPAM Q2 earnings (2025‑05‑15), (b) Fed policy meeting (2025‑06‑01), (c) Nvidia Q2 earnings (2025‑05‑20), (d) S&P 500 earnings season (mid‑May). 6) Remove generic statements (“positive risk‑on bias”) and replace with quantified expectations. 7) Ensure every claim has an inline citation (H86O3XRUJ). This will meet the handle‑mapping and catalyst‑window requirements and elevate the analysis to actionable, defensible insight.",
