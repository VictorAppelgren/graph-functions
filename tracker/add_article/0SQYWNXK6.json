      "summary": "WTI and gasoline futures fell sharply on Friday as concerns over global energy demand weighed on the market. The decline was driven by President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on trade‑surplus countries, weaker-than‑expected U.S. payroll and ISM manufacturing data, and a 2‑week low in the S&P 500 that dampened confidence in growth. Meanwhile, OPEC+ production hikes and a potential supply glut, along with rising tanker inventories, added further downward pressure. The market remains sensitive to any changes in U.S. economic data, tariff policy, and OPEC+ output decisions.",
