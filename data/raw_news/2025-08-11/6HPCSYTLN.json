  "title": "Is Taylor Swift about to enter her 12th era? She's going to be a guest on 'New Heights'",
  "description": "Taylor Swift appeared next to her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in a teaser for an upcoming episode of his podcast.",
  "content": "\u2022 Taylor Swift will be a surprise guest on the \"New Heights\" podcast with Travis Kelce.\n\nTaylor Swift may be swinging open the doors to an opulent era.\n\nThe singer was announced as a surprise guest on this week's \"New Heights\" podcast. In a teaser video, what appears to be an album sits on a shelf behind her. It's black with an orange outline. In front of it is an orange square with \"T.S.\" printed on it.\n\nSwift turns to Travis Kelce in a light blue sweater and says, \"Such a nice color on you.\"\n\nHe replies, \"Yes I know, it's the color of your eyes, sweetie. It's why we match so well.\"\n\n\"We're about to do a f***ing podcast,\" Swift responds.\n\nThe full podcast will air at 7 p.m. ET on Aug. 13. Listeners can subscribe to watch here.\n\nA countdown clock appeared on her website three hours before 12:12 a.m. on Aug. 12 sending fans into a spiral. A new album would be Swift's 12th.\n\nSwifties suspected the singer's next act was imminent after her in-house marketing account, Taylor Nation, shared an Instagram post the morning of August 11: \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era\u2026' \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25.\" A photo carousel of 12 photos showcased her orange bodysuits and dresses from the Eras Tour and included one shot of her and Sabrina Carpenter from the surprise set section in New Orleans.\n\nShortly before the Taylor Nation post, Travis Kelce's account and the \"New Heights\" podcast page shared a joint tease to a \"VERY special guest\" on an upcoming episode. A silhouette that looked like Swift sent her fandom into a tailspin of excitement. The image background was glittery orange, the same texture seen on her website with her letter reclaiming her entire catalog.\n\nComing full circle, the podcast is where Travis told his brother Jason he tried to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number. \"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" she said during her Time Magazine Person of the Year article. The two dated in secret before she appeared in an NFL suite at a Kansas City Chiefs and Chicago Bears game in September 2023.\n\nKelce has become a conduit for Swift news\n\nShe changed her lyrics for Kelce at the close of Eras Tour. Every time he was in the audience, she\u2019d switch up the tune to \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.\" When she won video of the year at the Video Music Awards, she thanked him in her speech.\n\n\"When I'd finish a take, and I'd say cut, and we'd be done with that take, I'd always just hear someone like cheering and like 'whoo' from across the studio,\" she said in the speech. \"And that one person was my boyfriend Travis. Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic.\"\n\nWhen he co-hosted Tight End University in May, she crashed the stage with Kane Brown to close out the night with \"Shake It Off.\"\n\n'The drought was the very worst'\n\nIt\u2019s been 555 days since Swift\u2019s last album announcement, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" which she revealed at the 2024 Grammy awards.\n\nSwift has been laying low with music news except for in May when she announed she had purchased the master recordings of her first six albums.\n\nIn an open letter, she hinted at a new era of sequins and rhinestones worthy of Elizabeth Taylor. The \"TS\" letterhead was framed by a diamond. She spelled \"thiiiiiiiiiiiis\" with 12 i's.\n\nIn her Eras Tour book, she began with a shot from her Paris concert where she debuted the orange body suit and finished her opening letter with \"See you next era...\" Fans noticed the countdown in France also turned orange before the opening sequence, and they clocked the \"Karma\" door appearing orange at the end of her show.\n\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\n\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV.",

      "text": "Is Taylor Swift going to announce new music on the 'New Heights' podcast? Why fans think so\nTaylor Swift's team is teasing fans with a fiery new hint that music is coming.\nTaylor Nation, the singer's in-house marketing and public relations team, created a 12-photo carousel on Instagram on Monday morning.\n\"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era\u2026'\" the caption said alongside an array of orange Eras Tour looks. The post ended with a burning heart emoji.\nIn less than 10 minutes, the Instagram post had been shared more than 10,000 times with fans screaming, shouting and throwing up in the comments.\n@happinessforswfit said, \"I'M LITERALLY SHAKING.\"\n@folklourest said, \"TS12 IS ORANGE DEFINITELY.\"\n@saumyasharma.__ commented, \"EXCUSE ME??? WHAT.\"\nAdding fuel to the flames, the \"New Heights\" podcast and Travis Kelce also edited a photo they shared.\n\"92%ers, we're coming back early for a special episode with a VERY special guest,\" the accounts said. The photo includes a black silhouette and a bedazzled orange background. Jason Kelce is donning what looks like an Eras Tour midnight blue sweater.\nWhen does the 'New Heights' podcast drop?\nFans will be tuning in on Aug. 13 for a 7 p.m. ET drop. The 13th would be apropos for an announcement as it is Swift's favorite number.\n'See you next era...'\nSwift's team placed her Eras Tour book in a glass case at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. Each year, the display inside the Taylor Swift Education Center gets a refresh.\nIn April, curators cracked the book open to its first page. The exhibit\u2019s theme this year is \"Fearless,\" so many expected a page from that era to be displayed alongside her Roberto Cavalli \"silver noodle\" dress, Christian Louboutin boots and the Swarovski-crystal guitar her family famously bedazzled. But on the page shown, Swift writes: \"There\u2019s nothing I hate more than doing what I\u2019ve always done.\"\nClues to \"TS12\" or her 12th era have been everywhere, according to eagle-eyed Swifties:\n- When she praised Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's new album \"I Said I Love You First\" on her Instagram story, Swift used 12 d's in \"oh my godddddddddddd.\"\n- To tease her return to the United States for the Eras Tour, Swift held her cat Meredith in Hard Rock Stadium's A12 section.\n- Swift's earrings at the Grammys had 12 red rubies.\n- In the letter announcing the ownership of her masters, she had 12 i's in \"thiiiiiiiiiiiis.\" The single numbers in the letter of 4, 6 and 2 add up to 12. The letterhead included a new \"TS\" diamond logo with 12 segments.\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "Taylor Swift makes VMAs history, thanks boyfriend Travis Kelce for 'fun and magic'\nLONG ISLAND, N.Y. \u2014 And for a fortnight, Taylor Swift will be celebrating after making history at MTV's Video Music Awards. The singer won seven awards Wednesday, including the night's top prize of video of the year.\nThat makes her the solo artist with the most career VMA wins, and the artist with the most video of the year wins.\nIn her acceptance speech for video of the year, she thanked her boyfriend Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. \"When I'd finish a take, and I'd say cut, and we'd be done with that take, I'd always just hear someone like cheering and like 'whoo' from across the studio,\" she said. \"And that one person was my boyfriend Travis. Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic.\"\nVMAs 2024 winners: Taylor Swift nabs video of the year, Chappell Roan is best new artist\nKelce did not make an appearance at the VMAs as he's likely practicing with the Chiefs ahead of their game Sunday in Kansas City against the Cincinnati Bengals.\nShe also thanked her fans for voting for her and encouraged them to go out and vote during this year's presidential election. \"If you are over 18, please register to vote for something else that's very important coming up,\" she said, a day after Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for president.\nThe Eras Tour star stunned on the red carpet in a plaid corset and skirt by Dior, thigh-high boots and fingerless gloves that stretched past her elbows.\nShe later changed into a bejeweled custom Monse mini dress with a spaceship on the front, perhaps a nod to \"Down Bad\" from \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" She has said that the lyrics to that song include love bombing and compared it to being abducted by aliens.\nRead more about the stars you love: Sign up for USA TODAY's Everyone's Talking newsletter.\nEverything Swift does is decoded by fans.\nWas the dress, with black leather shoulder straps and buckles, referencing the UFO in the \"TTPD\" set on the Eras Tour? Also, coincidence that the dress was made by the same designer that Michelle Obama wore while speaking at the Democratic National Convention?\n(If you loved the UFO dress, a similar dress that has a tapestry print rather than sequined, is on the Monse site for $990.) It is described as an \"alien UFO print, inspired by the iconic sci-fi films of the 1950s.\" But you'll need to be patient. The dress doesn't ship until January, 2025.\nSwift also thanked those who worked on the video, including Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles who appeared in cameos: \"Directing this video and putting it together and writing it was the most wonderful experience, and that is because of all the people that I got to make it with \u2014 and that includes my amazing cinematographer [and] Rodrigo Prieto, who goes out of his way to work with female directors. He's a genius and I can't believe I got to work with him as well as Ethan Tobman, my amazing production designer, who I worked with on the Eras Tour.\"\nThe tortured poet's first single off her 11th studio album, \"Fortnight (ft. Post Malone),\" won four awards, including for best direction and best collaboration.\nHow many VMAs did Taylor Swift win? See the singer's full, record-breaking haul\nWhen the collaboration win was announced, the audience got on their feet and shrieked with excitement. Swift came to the stage with Post Malone. Presenter Flava Flav jumped up and down hugging her.\n\u201cWaking up this morning in New York on Sept. 11,\" she said. \"Everyone we lost, and that is the most important thing about today.\u201d\nShe then complimented Post Malone. \"There is a very clear reason why Post Malone is everyone in music\u2019s favorite person,\" she said. \"You are so ridiculously talented, you are so versatile and you are the most down to earth person. Honestly so unfailingly politice, it has taken me forever to get him to stop calling me ma'am.\"\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" he responded. \"Taylor is absolutely one of the most kind and talented people I've ever had the honor of knowing.\"\nHe described how she directed the \"Fortnight\" music video while tied to an operating board during one scene.\n\"It was pretty bad***,\" he said.\nWednesday's wins mean she's up to a record 30 VMAs over her career, surpassing Beyonc\u00e9's 25 wins as a solo artist.\nSwift was up for 12 total awards Wednesday evening at the UBS Arena:\n- WON: Song of the summer for \"Fortnight\"\n- VMAs Most Iconic Performance: \"You Belong With Me\"\n- WON: Video of the year for \"Fortnight\"\n- WON: Artist of the year\n- Song of the year: \"Fortnight\"\n- WON: Best collaboration for \"Fortnight\"\n- WON: Best pop\n- WON: Best direction for \"Fortnight\"\n- Best cinematography: \"Fortnight\"\n- Best visual effects: \"Fortnight\"\n- Best art direction for \"Fortnight\"\n- WON: Best editing for \"Fortnight\"\nSwift's VMA history: awards and music performances\nSwift has a lengthy history with the VMAs extending back to 2008 when she was nominated for \"Our Song.\" The country singer won her first moon man for the \"You Belong With Me\" music video in 2009. She's collected hardware for her music videos for \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" \"Blank Space,\" \"Bad Blood (ft. Kendrick Lamar),\" \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever (ft. Zayn),\" \"You Need to Calm Down,\" \"ME! (ft. Brendon Urie),\" \"All Too Well: The Short Film\" and \"Anti-Hero.\"\nSwift's first win came with a maelstrom of controversy when Kanye West interrupted her speech telling the crowd, \"Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyonc\u00e9 had one of the best videos of all time!\" After the West interruption, Swift performed \"You Belong With Me\" in front of Radio City Music Hall.\nIn 2010, she sang \"Innocent,\" a song she revealed in New York Magazine that she wrote to West. Two years later in a red and white top, she sang, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\" In 2014, she shimmied to \"Shake It Off,\" joking when her dancers encouraged her to jump off a second-story \"1989\" platform, \"I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the VMAs, I\u2019m not jumping off there. People are getting bit by snakes; it\u2019s dangerous.\" The next year, Swift joined Nikki Minaj on stage for a mashup of \"The Night Is Still Young\" with \"Bad Blood.\" Her performance served as a harbinger to the dissolution of bad blood between her and West as she presented the rapper with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\nThe next year Swift was canceled by West and his then-wife Kim Kardashian. He released his song \"Famous,\" which included the line, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that b**** famous.\" Swift denied approving the lyrics, and Kardashian released a series of videos on Snapchat that made it seem like Swift was lying. Years later it came out that the videos were edited and Swift was telling the truth.\nIn 2017, Swift premiered her music video riddled with Easter eggs for \"Look What You Made Me Do\" at the show. Two years later, she returned to the stage singing \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover.\"\nIn 2022, to celebrate 13 years since her first win, Swift announced the release of \"Midnights.\" The singer stunned in a bejeweled gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.\nMore: Taylor Swift wins the most awards at 2023 VMAs including Video of the Year\nLast year, she lit up the red carpet in a black Versace gown with gold buttons and a thigh-high slit. The broadcast cut multiple times to the singer having a good time dancing with her friend and \"Karma\" collaborator Ice Spice. NSYNC reunited to honor the \"Anti-Hero\" star with an award for best pop video.\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "I spent a year covering Taylor Swift's Eras Tour around the world. Here's what it was like\nI'm not being hyperbolic when I say Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has been my job \u2014 and really, my life \u2014 for the past 13 months. I've posted 501 articles, made 42 television appearances, published 974 photos, edited 38 videos, filmed a documentary and written a book on Swift.\nIt all started with USA TODAY's viral job posting for the world's first full-time, dedicated Taylor Swift reporter. Earning the position led me to four continents to cover the record-shattering Eras Tour.\nSwift will wrap her magnum opus in Vancouver, Canada, on Sunday. And while many fans are theorizing what surprises she may have in store, I can't help but reminisce on the rollercoaster ride of the past year.\nI've watched the show in-person and on livestreams 89 times and, at 3 hours and 15 minutes a show, that's roughly 12 full days. The choreography, Swift's speeches and fan traditions are engrained in my DNA to the point I double clap during \"You Belong With Me\" like a dog conditioned by Pavlov's chime.\nIt's been the adventure of a lifetime.\nCelebrate the Eras Tour with our enchanting book\nIt's me, hi\nAfter accepting the position in October 2023, I had two weeks to pack up my life of 12 years in Phoenix and move to Nashville. Under the veil of secrecy, I said goodbye to friends who would find out with the rest of the world that I had been chosen.\nFor days, I sat in anticipation of my career news going viral. Before announcing my new job on social media, I sat in the parking lot outside Percy Warner Park, where Swift used to run. I pushed \"share\" and switched my phone to airplane mode. I played \"Fifteen (Taylor\u2019s Version).\"\n\"Count to 10, take it in, this is life before you know who you\u2019re going to be,\" echoed between my ears. How did a teenage songwriter pen the mantra of my 35th year?\nOne of my close friends housed me for two weeks, and my focus turned to setting up the new beat. His spare room had a walk-in closet with a desk that became a makeshift office. In my first TV appearance in this position, Gayle King and Charles Barkley asked me if I would be going to the Eras Tour concerts and I replied, \"I would love that. ... I've been watching the livestreams, honestly, from my friend's closet.\" And we just moved on without any context.\nCovering this Swift beat\nI would in fact soon book a trip to Japan and Australia for the spring. For the Eras Tour dates in Argentina and Brazil, I relied on new internet friends to keep me informed over WhatsApp with the help of Google Translate.\nFan accounts from different countries proved pivotal in covering Travis Kelce's first Eras Tour appearance as the singer's boyfriend and the campaign to project a Swift-themed T-shirt on the Christ the Redeemer statue.\nConcert nights became my days and, because of the different time zones, that meant covering the tour at all hours. In the beginning, all the livestream watching paid off when USA TODAY was one of the first outlets to report the famous lyric change \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me.\"\nSwift and her Eras Tour hit every news beat: business, crime, politics, weather, sports and of course, music.\nI was driving to Sparta, North Carolina, to report a story on a viral candle and soap company when news broke of the tragic death of Ana Clara Benevides Machado during a show in Rio de Janeiro. I repeatedly pulled to the side of the road to publish updates about the evolving situation in Brazil. I then switched gears to report on the mountain town small business.\nDomestic and international markets charted mini economic booms as the three hour show danced across Asia, Australia, Europe and the Americas. Swift brought an estimated $228 million to Japan\u2019s economy. In Sydney, she raked in an estimated $43 million on merchandise. Indiana University economists reported the singer brought in $100 million to Indianapolis.\nSoutheast Asia politicians were bitter about an exclusive deal Singapore struck with the singer. The Phillippines announced they would build a Taylor Swift-ready stadium by 2028 to court future shows.\nA thwarted terrorist plot rattled Vienna before tens of thousands of fans gathered in the streets to sing together. The teenager arrested told officials he planned to kill as many people as possible. I covered that the week after my birthday, on the one vacation I took. As I was having lunch at a restaurant, my phone blew up with texts and alerts. I sprinted down a Rehoboth, Delaware, boardwalk to my AirBnb to chase the story as it unfolded on the other side of the ocean.\nThe singer released three albums \u2014 \"Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version),\" \"1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\" and \"The Tortured Poets Department\" over the two year tour. She debuted three music videos and brought out special guests. One weekend, a story included Paul McCartney handing out friendship bracelets.\nHeadlines about Swift attending Chiefs games because of her relationship with Kelce overran sports media. Dads and daughters bonded over touchdowns. And Brads and Chads clutched their pearls when broadcasts showed the superstar for less than 30 seconds a game.\nSome of the biggest stories broke during gaps in Swift's schedule. She bypassed production studios to release her blockbuster concert movie. She was crowned Time Magazine Person of the Year. She released an 11th studio album. She endorsed a presidential candidate.\nI joked with my co-workers at The Tennessean: \"Taylor, it's a Monday in June, please don't announce anything on your travel day to Cardiff, Wales.\"\nGetting seats to the hottest show\nI experienced the Great War to get tickets on multiple continents. I am in no way affiliated with Swift or her team, and they declined to provide me media passes to cover the tour. With resale prices for her last show in Vancouver hitting four digits, fans might be shocked to know a restricted view ticket in Lisbon, Portugal, was $81 while a floor seat in Paris was $150.\nThe hardest stops to get tickets were in Australia, where the law requires that resale tickets have no more than a 10% markup for certain events. And even though the Melbourne stadium was the tour's largest, holding 96,000 concertgoers each night, the insurmountable demand and price cap made it nearly impossible to get inside. I was lucky that a friend of a friend had a last-minute cancellation in her group and asked me to go with her and her daughters.\nWhen I didn't attend shows in person, I watched livestreams broadcast from fans' phones for the entire three-plus hours. It was one of the incredible ways Swifties created community around this tour. Those without tickets would Taylor-gate together outside open-roofed stadiums where they could hear the concert for free. Fans exchanged friendship bracelets, showed off bedazzled outfits and shared innumerable acts of kindness.\nIntroducing 'Female Rage: The Musical'\nThe show evolved. Before this job even existed, I bought two tickets to the first Paris show. That proved immensely beneficial as the Eras Tour ringleader scrambled her eras and made room for \"The Tortured Poets Department\" section. Sitting in the lower bowl, I sent my editor stanzas, every once in a while snapping a photo and texting it over.\nKelce appeared at the final night in Paris, concert No. 87, as Swift sang a love mashup to her tight end boyfriend. I had a ticket for the floor \u2014 where there were no assigned seats \u2014 allowing me to stand by the barricade he walked by as Swift played \"Karma.\" He showed off his waving hand dance moves and gave a few fans next to me some high fives.\nIn Lisbon, I was grabbing a video of the singer exiting through a tunnel when she looked up. Just like when covering a politician or sports team, you can\u2019t dress up as your beat so I always wore a single-color polo or Tennessean T-shirt, which ironically made me stick out among the sea of bedazzled outfits. Swift smiled, pointed and mouthed what looked like \"I\u2019ve seen you\" or \"I know you.\"\nIn summation\nI'm often asked about my favorite moment from the past year, and the truth is, there isn\u2019t a specific one among the garish kaleidoscope of memories. The highlights include: witnessing the wristbands shining bright purple during \"Long Live\" in Melbourne, going live on Australian television in the pouring rain, meeting influencers who I've interviewed over FaceTime in real life in Paris and London, watching the production staff behind the curtain from a restricted view seat in Lisbon, standing next to the diamond stage in Madrid with the fan who runs the Eras Tour Instagram account, touring the Victoria and Albert Museum's Swift collection before doors opened, being a guest on a Swift podcast I've listened to for years in Miami, surprising a fan who had never been to a show with a ticket in New Orleans and turning my phone off in Indianapolis to watch the final American show.\nThe memories may be unique to me, but the overall themes are common to anyone who went to one or more Eras Tour shows. And even though this chapter is wrapping up, Swift is already working on her next project. In the foreword to her official concert book, she wrote, \"See you in the next era.\" It's one I plan to cover.\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "Inside Taylor Swift's surprise performance for Tight End University in Nashville\n- Taylor Swift made a surprise appearance at a Nashville charity concert for Tight End University.\n- Swift performed \"Shake It Off\" with Kane Brown at the sold-out Brooklyn Bowl.\n- The concert benefited charities chosen by NFL tight ends Travis Kelce, George Kittle, and Greg Olsen.\nTaylor Swift performed live for the first time in six months \u2014 on a stage few would have expected at a Nashville venue that holds up to 1,200 people.\nKane Brown was announced as the final act during a showcase of country singers (and a rap artist) for the Tight Ends and Friends benefit concert on June 24. Tickets sold out to the concert immediately after Swift appeared at a welcome reception at L.A. Jackson on June 23.\nBrown performed his hits \"Miles on It\" and \"Like I Love Country Music,\" before turning to the audience and saying, \"I've got something cool I want to do for you guys.\"\nAs the crowd cheered, Brown asked the drummer, \"Can you play a beat for me?\" He picked up a jingle stick to shake, shake, shake it.\n\"Do y'all care if I bring out a really really really really special guest?\" Brown said, lifting his hands into the air. As Swift emerged from the shadows of the stage wing, the audience let loose a roar of excitement heavier than the house band's tempo.\nThe Eras Tour singer slung a guitar she borrowed from singer Chase Rice over her shoulder, the strings still hot from Rice's performance 20 minutes earlier. Before walking up to the microphone Swift hugged Brown.\n\"See the one thing tight ends have in common with Nashville musicians is we're all friends, right? So you know, we're up there,\" Swift told fans, gesturing to the second floor VIP section where she, her boyfriend Travis Kelce, her best friend from childhood Abigail Anderson Berard and Abigail's husband Charles Berard rocked out to musical acts along with 80 NFL tight ends in town for a three-day training event.\n\"And we're having some drinks,\" Swift said. \"We were thinking like, 'How loud could this place get?'\"\nThe audience unleashed an ear-shattering form of approval and Swift dedicated her smash hit \"Shake It Off\" to \"our favorite players who are going to play, the tight ends.\"\nImmediately a sea of arms holding camera phones shot into the air as the singer in an EB Denim black dress and Versace leather boots jumped into her \"1989\" chart topper.\n\"Honestly have you ever seen a tambourine played like this?\" Swift asked after the first chorus, gesturing to Brown. \"This is fantastic work by Mr. Kane Brown.\"\nSwift \u2014 who has been on a musical break for six months following her successful Eras Tour \u2014 shared Brown's mic as they belted the final chorus. The high energy performance was her first live show since buying back her masters in May.\nShe slung the guitar off her shoulder and said, \"Will you please give it up for this amazing band who just figured out that we were going to play that three minutes ago.\"\nThen she turned to hug Brown, the backup singers and the instrumentalists before disappearing off stage.\nLong live the Eras Tour with our enchanting book\nWhat is Tight End University?\nTight End University was started by San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle in 2021. More than 80 to 90 NFL tight ends descend on Music City from all professional football teams to study film, perform on-field drills and discuss recovery and rehabilitation.\n\"George has always represented camaraderie over competition,\" Leigh Taylor Richardson, a spokesperson for the event, told The Tennessean on June 18. \"He wants everyone involved and everyone included. A lot of people may be super secretive about what makes them the best, but he wanted to start Tight End University to share his secrets, uplift the tight end position, raise money for charity and put a spotlight on what George says really keeps all tight ends at the top of their game \u2014 their wives and girlfriends!\"\nKittle enlisted the help of his friends Travis Kelce and Greg Olsen, who have helped him run the event for five years.\nThe only event open to the public is the benefit concert at Brooklyn Bowl, which sold out immediately after social media was flooded with photos and videos of Swift spending time with Kelce. Fans bought general admission, standing room only tickets for about $35 plus tax not knowing Swift would be in attendance, let alone perform.\nOnly Jordan Davis, Chase Rice, Sophia Scott and Graham Barham had been announced on social media. Nico Moon and Ernest also performed. All the proceeds from the event go toward three organizations: Kelce's nonprofit 87 and Running, which helps disadvantaged youths; The Heartest Yard, which helps kids with congenital heart disease; and a charity of Kittle's choosing.\nTwo years ago, attendees raised $800,000. Last year, they raised $900,000. The hope this year is to pass $1 million.\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV.\n(This story was updated to add a video.)"

      "text": "'Karma is the guy on the Chiefs': Taylor Swift sings about Travis Kelce on Eras Tour\nTaylor Swift closed out her second show in Buenos Aires, Argentina, by changing the lyrics to her song \"Karma\" to reference tight end Travis Kelce, who attended the show that night.\n\"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\" Swift sang about the NFL player who flew south during the team's bye week.\nKelce watched the show from the VIP tent with Swift's dad, Scott Swift. Videos posted to social media showed Kelce dancing, eating snacks and flashing Swift's classic heart hand symbol.\nAfter the concert ended, video posted to social media showed Swift ran up to Kelce and kissed him.\nEarlier, the crowd erupted when Taylor Swift played \"End Game\" on piano as part of her surprise acoustic set.\nSwifties know \"End Game\" as the song that describes a possibly final relationship with the lyrics: \"I want to be your end game. I want to be your first string. I want to be your A team.\"\nThe first song in the acoustic set was \"Is it Over Now?\" on guitar from \"1989 (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault].\" She did a mash-up with the bridge from \"Out of the Woods\" also from \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" before diving into the final bridge of \"Is It Over Now?\" again.\n\"I'm on a quest to reclaim my music,\" Swift said. \"I am so blown away. And you did something else that is beyond my comprehension and that is a song that I wrote for '1989' that didn't make the album, you got that song to go No. 1 on the Top 100.\"\nDuring the \"Evermore\" set, Swift did a victory dance for her recent Grammy nominations.\n\"Had sort of a crazy day yesterday, because I started my morning by getting the extraordinary news that because of you and because of the way you have supported my album 'Midnights,' it got nominated for six Grammys,\" she said.\nHands pumping in the air from her ivy piano, she took a dance break. She is the only female artist to win Album of the Year three times; \"Midnights\" would give her a fourth triumph.\nIt was the second highlight of the \"Evermore\" set. From the stage, Swift may not have been able to see the group of 40-plus Swifties holding hands and dancing in a circle to her song \"Willow.\"\nSwift will finish the Argentinian leg of the Eras Tour Sunday with a makeup show. Her Friday concert was canceled due to unrelenting rain, but the good news is airlines are allowing passengers to change their tickets at no cost.\nMore: Airlines let Taylor Swift fans rebook Argentina flights at no cost after concert postponed\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "Taylor Swift's fight to own her music changed recording contracts in ways good and bad\nTaylor Swift is shooting back to the top of the charts despite not releasing new music over the past year on the news the singer was able to buy the master recordings of her first six albums.\nOn May 29, Swift published an almost 700-word letter explaining her decision to buy her entire catalog of music, music videos, album art and unreleased songs from Shamrock Capital.\n\"I'm extremely heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry among artists and fans,\" Swift wrote in the letter. \"Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen.\"\nLong live the Eras Tour with our enchanting book\nWhen new artists sign with labels, they often lack leverage to negotiate favorable contract terms. As a result, labels maintain control over an artist's creative output. After Swift's rerecorded versions her first four albums eclipsed the streaming records of her original albums, some labels updated their contracts to keep artists from rerecording until 10-15 years after they've left the label.\n\"One of the things that record labels historically do is prevent artists from rerecording their early versions of songs, because they wanna have those recordings in their catalog,\" said David Herlihy, an intellectual property, new media and entertainment lawyer who also teaches at Northeastern University in Boston. \"Which is ridiculous.\"\nHerlihy said Swift's move will help artists who achieve virality or develop their own audience thanks to social media and the internet. Take pop singer and Bonnaroo headliner Olivia Rodrigo, who added a caveat to her Geffen Records contract to own her masters. Rodrigo told The Guardian's Laura Snapes in May 2021 she was \"inspired by Swift's fight to own her own music.\"\n\"When Taylor signed with Big Machine Label, she was beholden to her capitalist overlords,\" Herlihy said. \"Technology has changed, and it's disrupting the recordings business model and marketplace. The whole way that audiences access recordings has completely changed. So the whole dynamic makes it possible, although not easy, for an artist like Olivia to reach a big audience and have more leverage power.\"\nOther artists who own their masters include Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Zara Larsson, Frank Ocean and Anita Baker. Swift tweeted to Baker in 2021 when the soulful singer shared she just bought back her catalog, \"What a beautiful moment, CONGRATULATIONS ANITA!! \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f.\"\nOn May 29, Baker celebrated back to Swift, \"CONGRATULATIONS\ud83c\udf88 #TaylorSwift All your babies are back Home, with their Momma. Where they belong. \ud83d\ude18\"\nChart topping with no new music\nSwift's music flexed its power all weekend as all of her first six albums skyrocketed up the charts. Fans flocked to her original recordings \u2014 knowing every song is now \"Taylor's Version\" \u2014 and pushed play guilt-free.\nWithin 24 hours of the announcement, the U.S. iTunes Top Albums included at No. 1 \"Reputation,\" No. 2 \"Taylor Swift\" (debut album), No. 8 \"Speak Now,\" No. 9 \"1989,\" No. 14 \"Red\" and No. 27 \"Fearless.\" Apple Music told The Tennessean her music jumped 80% immediately after the letter went live.\n\"Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion,\" Swift said in her letter. \"You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended up here.\"\nThe fandom may not have gotten \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" and \"Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version)\" albums ... at least not yet. The singer-songwriter plans to release the vault tracks to her sixth album and a rerecorded debut, country album in the future.\n\"Those 2 albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about,\" she wrote. The most interesting part of the letter may be the concealed second page lying underneath, a possible harbinger of what's to come as Swift continues to rewrite history.\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "Taylor Swift announces brand-new album at Grammys: 'Tortured Poets Department'\nTaylor Swift set the Swiftie world on fire by announcing a brand-new album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" during the Grammys on Sunday.\n\"I want to say thank you to the fans,\" Swift said holding her Grammy for pop vocal album, \"by telling you a secret that I've been keeping from you for the past two years, which is that my brand-new album comes out April 19.\"\nSwift made the announcement after winning her 13th Grammy, for \"Midnights.\" The artwork for the new album is a black-and-white photo of Swift lying on a bed. According to Swift's website, her 11th record will include 16 tracks plus bonus track \u201cThe Manuscript.\u201d\nIn the tweet she sent out shortly after her acceptance speech, a photo shows a folder open to a page with Swift's handwriting:\n\"And so I enter into evidence / My tarnished coat of arms / My muses, acquired like bruises / My talismans and charms / The tick, tick, tick of love bombs / My veins of pitch black ink / All's fair in love and poetry... Sincerely, The Chairman of The Tortured Poets Department.\"\nHours before the 66th annual Grammys, Swift's website \"crashed,\" with the message: \"Error 321 Backend fetch failed.\" Error 321 is a communication error that would appear on a fax machine with a poor telephone line connection. There was also a random line in bold: hneriergrd. Online sleuths have unscrambled it to get \"red herring.\" A red herring is a \"a clue or piece of information that is, or is intended to be, misleading or distracting.\"\nThis prompted the internet to look into the coding of the website, where one coder noticed multiple words in different languages translated to \"chairman,\" \"bruises,\" \"veins,\" \"cadence,\" \"apple cake,\" \"talisman,\" \"love bombs,\" \"muse,\" \"ink,\" \"evidence\" and \"fake.\"\nThese words correspond to the aesthetic of the new album, which feels like a black-and-white, 1950s police detective show. The internet will continue to unravel Easter eggs as Swift heads to Japan for the first leg of the 2024 Eras Tour.\nThe album will be released when Swift is on a break.\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "Sabrina Carpenter joins Taylor Swift onstage in New Orleans on her one night off\nTaylor Swift's Saturday night show in New Orleans came with surprises. In an orange dress, the singer told the crowd she changed the rules of her surprise set. She was going to sing a song not in her discography, but in her friend Sabrina Carpenter's music catalog.\n\"I think tonight I'm going to do something completely different, which is that I'm going to sing a song that's not mine, but it's somebody that I really love,\" the singer said to the 65,000 people in attendance before strumming \"Espresso\" by Carpenter. She finished after a couple of lines and paused.\n\"So you really love that song as much as I do?\" Swift asked, smiling. \"I know I'm just going on a tangent because I love my friend and I'm just so proud of Sabrina and the year she's had.\"\nThe Eras Tour crowd erupted in the Caesars Superdome as Swift grabbed her phone from a stage hand and put Carpenter on speaker.\n\"I'm really somewhere really loud, I'm in New Orleans on the Eras Tour,\" Swift said into the phone. \"I just wanted to call and tell you that I sang a little bit of 'Espresso' and they said every word so loud. And I just wanted to say we all love you so much. What are you doing? Why aren't you here with us?\"\nOver the phone, Carpenter said, \"I'm somewhere where everyone is screaming so loud.\"\n\"I'm somewhere where people are screaming so loud,\" Swift answered. \"Can you come down to the stadium real quick? Ball park how long would that take you?\"\n\"It would probably take me five seconds,\" Carpenter responded. The crowd cheered and then held their breath until Carpenter appeared on the platform in the diamond part of the stage. She strutted down the catwalk in her white dress.\nSwift strummed an acoustic version of \"Espresso\" and sang harmony with Carpenter.\n\"Holy (expletive) New Orleans!\" Carpenter said after the first chorus.\n\"Can I do it?\" Swift asked in reference to the first line of the second verse, \"I'm working late, cause I'm a singer.\u201d She then dove into part of her song \"Is It Over Now?\" from \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" and then \"Please, Please, Please\" from Carpenter's new album.\n\"She had literally one day off,\" Swift said at the end of the triple mashup, \"She is on tour. This is crazy she came to perform for us. Will you please give it up for Sabrina Carpenter?\"\nCarpenter walked down the catwalk and disappeared into the stage.\nSwift moved to the piano to perform a mashup of \"Hits Different\" from \"Midnights\" and \"Welcome to New York\" from \"1989 (Taylor's Version).\"\nThe singer-songwriter has one more performance in New Orleans. The tour will wrap on Dec. 8 in Vancouver, Canada.\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."
