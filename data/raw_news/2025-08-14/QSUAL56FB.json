  "title": "Overheating Laptop? 5 Things That Cause a Laptop to Overheat, and How to Fix Them",
  "description": "Let's make your laptop cool.",
  "content": "Is your laptop producing excessive heat even when performing normal tasks? This isn't one of those issues you can ignore, as overheating can cause serious problems to your laptop in the long run, such as thermal throttling. But why exactly does your laptop overheat, and what can you do to prevent it?\n\nThese 5 Factors Are Causing Your Laptop to Overheat\n\nAn overheating laptop can cause any number of problems. It can increase your laptop\u2019s boot time, significantly affect your laptop\u2019s speed, and even cause the operating system to crash sporadically. It can also make the built-in fans of your laptop produce more noise, and reduce their lifespan. While there could be several reasons why your laptop overheats, the following ones are often the main culprits.\n\nMost of your laptop's components, such as the processor, produce heat when they function. To manage the heat generated by these components, manufacturers install a fan in your laptop. This fan helps heat escape through the air vents, which are mainly located beneath your laptop's keyboard.\n\nSince most of us have the habit of using our laptops on our laps, we often end up blocking the air vents accidentally. I\u2019m writing this guide with my laptop placed on my lap, and yes, it is also getting warm. I can feel it on my thighs.\n\nWhen the air vents are blocked, the fans are unable to displace the warm air; as a result, your laptop overheats. When this happens, the fan will start rotating at a higher speed and produce more noise. The solution, in this case, is to ensure that you place and use the laptop in an upright position, and ensure that the vents (which are often on the sides or back) are clear.\n\nThe warm air might also fail to exit the laptop due to the accumulation of dirt and debris on the air vents. In this case, you'll have to manually clean the vents. To do this, shut down your laptop and disconnect it from the charger. Then, use a can of compressed air to get rid of all the dirt and debris from the vents.\n\nIf you notice that the laptop fan is still making noise even after you have cleared the air vents, it indicates that dirt and dust have accumulated on the fan itself, causing it to work harder to dissipate the heat generated by your laptop. In this case, you need to open the back of your laptop and clean the fan. You can use a compressed air can or a toothbrush to remove the dirt and debris. I would advise cleaning the vents and fan every 3 to 4 months.\n\nYour GPU and CPU produce heat when they function. The amount of heat produced by both these components is directly proportional to the amount of work they are doing. For instance, if you are performing a basic task like browsing the internet or using lightweight applications like Microsoft Paint, then it\u2019s not going to put much stress on your laptop\u2019s GPU or CPU.\n\nHowever, if you perform resource-demanding tasks on your laptop, like playing graphics-intensive games such as Cyberpunk or using CPU-hogging applications like Photoshop, then your laptop's GPU and CPU will have to do a lot of work; as a result, they will produce a lot of heat.\n\nYou can take a look at your CPU and GPU temperatures using applications like HWMonitor. Under your CPU name section, you will find a subsection called Temperatures. Expand the \"Cores\" option to view the temperature of all your CPU cores. Then, under your GPU name section, you'll find the temperature of your GPU under the Temperature subsection.\n\nIt's normal for the CPU and GPU temperatures to rise when you perform resource-demanding tasks. However, if you notice the temperature gets very high\u2014like CPU and GPU numbers reaching 80-90\u00b0 C\u2014then it is something you need to be concerned about.\n\nThere could also be a bug with your graphics driver, similar to the one that happened with the NVIDIA driver a few years ago, which causes the driver to stay in its highest performance mode even when users are not performing any graphics-intensive tasks. As a result, the GPU was always in the working state, which ultimately resulted in higher GPU temperatures.\n\nYou can usually find discussions in online forms and the official support pages that will confirm if a bug like that exists. If there is a bug causing the issue, an official patch delivered via a driver update will usually sort out the problem.\n\nThe thermal paste and pads of your CPU and GPU could also dry out over time, which ultimately results in lower GPU and CPU performance. In this case, unfortunately, you will have to visit a technician to get your GPU and CPU thermal paste and pads replaced.\n\nOn your Windows laptop, you can manually choose between Best Performance, Balanced, and Best Power Efficiency power modes depending on your usage. For instance, if you are about to perform a resource-demanding task on your laptop, I would recommend changing the Power Mode to \"Best Performance.\" This will ensure that your laptop uses more energy to offer better performance.\n\nWhile it may be intimidating to keep the Power Mode always configured as Best Performance, the downside of selecting this option is that your laptop will produce more heat in order to offer you good performance. That's why it's better to switch back to the Balanced option to get a balanced performance and battery life from your laptop.\n\nDisabling CPU Turbo Boost is another quick way to fix your laptop's overheating issue. To do this, open the Registry Editor and navigate to the following location:\n\nDouble-click \"Attributes\" on the right pane, type 0 in the Value data field, and click \"OK.\"\n\nNext, open the Control Panel, and navigate to System and Security > Power Options > Change Plan Settings > Change Advanced Power Settings.\n\nDouble-click \"Processor Power Management\" and then \"Processor Performance Boost Mode.\" Choose \"Disabled\" for both On Battery and Plugged In. Finally, click \"Apply\" and \"OK\" to save the changes.\n\nUnlike an OS update, I don't normally recommend updating your computer's BIOS because it isn't usually necessary. BIOS updates don't normally bring any new features to your computer; instead, they introduce support for new CPU models or fix a bugs with any of the installed hardware.\n\nHowever, if you have tried all the other listed solutions and are still facing the overheating issue on your laptop, then updating the BIOS may do the trick. Unless you have made any changes, the BIOS is configured to control your laptop\u2019s fan speed. So, if you notice that the fan starts to run at full speed due to excessive heat in your laptop, then updating the BIOS could solve the problem.\n\nBIOS updates may also affect the behavior of your CPU, which could affect how much heat it outputs.\n\nIn addition to updating BIOS, you should also make sure that you are using the latest Windows update. To check for any available updates for your laptop, open the Settings app, choose \"Windows Update,\" and click the \"Check for Updates\" button.\n\nOther Reasons That Can Make Your Laptop Overheat\n\nI talked about all the basic reasons that can contribute to an overheating laptop\u2014all reasons that can be addressed without needing to buy anything. However, if you continue to face the overheating issue on your laptop despite following all the solutions mentioned above, it's an indication that there's a serious issue with your laptop\u2019s hardware.\n\nI recommend opening the Task Manager whenever your laptop overheats and checking the Memory and CPU tabs. If you see that your laptop is consuming 80-100 percent of the available memory and CPU, it confirms that the overheating issue is caused by insufficient RAM. As it turns out, when your laptop doesn't have enough RAM, it relies on the installed storage drive for virtual memory. This, in turn, increases the load on your CPU and the drive itself, causing them to heat up. Upgrading your RAM is the best solution in this situation.\n\nIn addition to having less RAM, the overheating issue can also stem from an old or failing laptop battery. To confirm this, you should generate a battery health report on your laptop and check for any red flags in it. If there are any, I highly recommend replacing your laptop battery.\n\nIt's completely normal for an old laptop to produce more heat compared to a new one due to the aging of its components. However, if it's producing more heat than expected, or if you are facing overheating issues on a new laptop, then you now know what's causing the problem and how to fix it.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Check your BIOS version by typing \"wmic bios get smbiosbiosversion\" in the Command Prompt. It's important to update your BIOS correctly to avoid rendering your computer unbootable.\n- You can also find your BIOS version in the System Information window by typing \"msinfo32\" in a Run box. Look at the \"BIOS Version/Date\" field.\n- Update your BIOS by visiting the motherboard manufacturer's website and downloading the latest BIOS version for your specific model. Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer's website to update the BIOS safely and correctly.\nYou probably shouldn't update your BIOS, but sometimes you need to. Here's how to check what BIOS version your computer is using and flash that new BIOS version onto your motherboard as quickly and safely as possible.\nBe very careful when updating your motherboard's BIOS! If your computer freezes, crashes, or loses power during the process, the BIOS or UEFI firmware may be corrupted. This will render your computer unbootable \u2014 it'll be \"bricked.\"\nHow to Check Your Current BIOS Version in Windows\nYour computer's BIOS version is displayed in the BIOS setup menu itself, but you don't have to reboot to check this version number. There are several ways to see your BIOS version from within Windows, and they work the same on PCs with a traditional BIOS or a newer UEFI firmware.\nCheck Your BIOS Version at the Command Prompt\nTo check your BIOS version from the Command Prompt, hit Start, type \"cmd\" in the search box, and then click the \"Command Prompt\" result \u2014 no need to run it as an administrator.\nAt the prompt, type (or copy and paste) the following command, and then hit Enter:\nwmic bios get smbiosbiosversion\nYou'll see the version number of the BIOS or UEFI firmware in your current PC.\nCheck Your BIOS Version by Using the System Information Panel\nYou can also find your BIOS's version number in the System Information window. On Windows 7, 8, or 10, hit Windows+R, type \"msinfo32\" into the Run box, and then hit Enter.\nThe BIOS version number is displayed on the System Summary pane. Look at the \"BIOS Version/Date\" field.\nHow to Update Your BIOS\nDifferent motherboards use different utilities and procedures, so there's no one-size-fits-all set of instructions here. However, you'll perform the same basic process on all motherboards.\nFirst, head to the motherboard manufacturer's website and find the Downloads or Support page for your specific model of motherboard. You should see a list of available BIOS versions, along with any changes/bug fixes in each and the dates they were released. Download the version to which you want to update. You'll probably want to grab the newest BIOS version \u2014 unless you have a specific need for an older one.\nIf you purchased a pre-built computer instead of building your own, head to the computer manufacturer's website, look up the computer model, and look at its downloads page. You'll find any available BIOS updates there.\nYour BIOS download probably comes in an archive \u2014 usually a ZIP file. Extract the contents of that file. Inside, you'll find some sort of BIOS file \u2014 in the screenshot below, it's the E7D14AMS.291 file.\nThe archive may also contain a README or other text file that will walk you through updating to the new BIOS. You should check out this file for instructions that apply specifically to your hardware, but we'll try to cover the basics that work across all hardware here.\nYou'll need to choose one of several different types of BIOS-flashing tools, depending on your motherboard and what it supports. The BIOS update's included README file should recommend the ideal option for your hardware.\nSome manufacturers offer a BIOS-flashing option directly in their BIOS, or as a special key-press option when you boot the computer. You copy the BIOS file to a USB drive, reboot your computer, and then enter the BIOS or UEFI screen. From there, you choose the BIOS-updating option, select the BIOS file you placed on the USB drive, and the BIOS updates to the new version.\nYou generally access the BIOS screen by pressing the appropriate key while your computer boots \u2014 it's often displayed on the screen during the boot process and will be noted in your motherboard or PC's manual. Common BIOS keys include Delete and F2. The process for entering a UEFI setup screen can be a bit different.\nThere are also more traditional DOS-based BIOS-flashing tools. When using those tools, you create a DOS live USB drive, and then copy the BIOS-flashing utility and BIOS file to that USB drive. You then restart your computer and boot from the USB drive. In the minimal DOS environment that appears after the reboot, you run the appropriate command \u2014 often something like flash.bat BIOS3245.bin\n\u2014 and the tool flashes the new version of the BIOS onto the firmware.\nThe DOS-based flashing tool is often provided in the BIOS archive you download from the manufacturer's website, although you may have to download it separately. Look for a file with the .bat or .exe file extension.\nIn the past, this process was performed with bootable floppy disks and CDs. We recommend a USB drive because it's the easiest method on modern hardware \u2014 a ton of modern computers don't even have CD or DVD drives anymore.\nSome manufacturers provide Windows-based flashing tools, which you run on the Windows desktop to flash your BIOS and then reboot. We don't recommend using these, and even many manufacturers who provide these tools caution against using them. For example, MSI \"strongly recommends\" using their BIOS-based menu option instead of their Windows-based utility in the README file of the sample BIOS update we downloaded.\nFlashing your BIOS from within Windows can result in more problems. All that software running in the background \u2014 including security programs that may interfere with writing to the computer's BIOS \u2014 can cause the process to fail and corrupt your BIOS. Any system crashes or freezes might also result in a corrupted BIOS. It's better to be safe than sorry, so we recommend using a BIOS-based flashing tool or booting to a minimal DOS environment to flash your BIOS.\nThat's it \u2014 after you run the BIOS-flashing utility, reboot your computer, and the new BIOS or UEFI firmware version loads. If there's a problem with the new BIOS version, you may be able to downgrade it by downloading an older version from the manufacturer's website and repeating the flashing process."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/217010/how-to-generate-a-battery-health-report-on-windows-8-or-windows-10/",
      "text": "Windows 10, 11, and previous versions all include a hidden \"Battery Report\" feature. Generate a report to see health information about your laptop's battery, how its capacity has decreased over time, and other interesting statistics.\nThis battery reporting feature is built into the\npowercfg\ncommand, so you'll have to pop into Windows Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell to run the command. We'll be using PowerShell in this tutorial, but either works just fine. You can also use powercfg to generate an energy report, which gives you recommendations for ways you can reduce your computer's energy usage and extend its battery life.\nGenerate a Battery Report\nThe actual battery report you'll be generating is an easy-to-understand web page file. You just have to run a single command to create it.\nFirst, open a PowerShell window. Press Windows+X or right-click the Start button (represented by the Windows icon) and choose \"PowerShell\" from the Power User menu.\nAt the PowerShell prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:\npowercfg /batteryreport\nThis command saves a battery report in HTML format to the following location:\nC:UsersYOUR_USERNAMEbattery report.html\nJust head to your user directory in a File Explorer window and double-click the file to open it in your default browser.\nHow to Read the Battery Report\nThe battery report is a single HTML page, divided into a variety of sections. The first section tells you the name and product name of your computer, the BIOS and OS build version, whether the PC supports Connected Standby, and the time the report was generated.\nInstalled Batteries\nThe \"Installed Batteries\" section shows you information about your installed batteries, and you'll only see one battery on most devices. Battery information includes the name, manufacturer, serial number, and chemistry type of the battery.\nThe most important details here, though, are the design capacity, full charge capacity, and cycle count numbers.\nFor example, in the screenshot above, you can see that the design capacity of the battery is 44,400 mWh, while the current full charge capacity is 37,685 mWh. This is a result of the normal wear a battery experiences over time, and it lets you see just how worn down your battery is. The battery was originally designed to hold 42,002 mWh, but now has a maximum of 40,226, meaning it holds a little less charge than it used to. For reference, the laptop we used was about five years old. This number will continue going down over time as you use your battery and put it through more charge cycles.\nNote: If you have a new device, it may actually have a higher current full charge capacity than its design capacity. That number will decrease over time as the battery chemistry changes.\nThe cycle count number in the \"Installed Batteries\" section shows you how many charge cycles a battery has been through. A full charge cycle is measured by 100% battery drain. So, a cycle might be a full discharge from 100% to 0%. Or, a full cycle could be discharge from 100% to 50%, a charge back up to 100%, and then another discharge down to 50%. Both of those count as a single cycle. Batteries can only handle so many charge cycles, and different batteries are rated for different numbers of charge cycles.\nRecent Usage\nThe \"Recent Usage\" section of your battery report displays the device's power states over the last three days. You can see when your device started, when it was suspended, and how much battery capacity drained over time. The capacity remaining is displayed as both a battery percentage and a number in mWh.\nBattery Usage\nThe \"Battery usage\" section offers a graph that shows how your battery drained over time. Both this and the \"Recent Usage\" section display data for the last three days only.\nUsage History\nThe \"Usage history\" section shows your battery's usage and duration over time. You can see how much time the device spent on battery power and how much time it spent plugged into a power outlet. The statistics here go all the way back to when you originally set up Windows on the PC---possibly to when you purchased the device.\nBattery Capacity History\nThe \"Battery Capacity History\" section is also interesting. You can see how your battery's full charge capacity gradually decreased over time compared to its design capacity. Like with the above section, the statistics here go back to when you originally set up Windows on the computer.\nBattery Life Estimates\nThe \"Battery Life Estimates\" section displays an estimate of your device's average battery life for different time periods, based on how you actually used it. Interestingly enough, it compares observed battery life at the device's full charge to theoretical battery life at its design capacity.\nFor example, the most numbers displayed in the screenshot below show that the device managed four hours and forty-six minutes of battery life at its current full charge capacity, but that it would have managed four hours and fifty-eight minutes if the battery was still at its design capacity.\nDetails like this one can help you decide when it's time to replace the battery. If the difference is drastic, you may want to get a new battery for your laptop or tablet.\nThe battery report doesn't provide any instructions or recommendations, as the energy report does. However, the in-depth information about your battery's capacity over time will help you get an idea of your battery's health and understand whether you need to replace it or might in the future.\nDon't forget about your mobile devices, though. There are ways you can check your Android, iPhone, and iPad's battery health."

      "text": "Summary\n- ASUS laptops & certain processors are facing BSOD issues due to Windows 11 update.\n- Integrated cameras are crashing after update, Windows Hello failing.\n- Easy Anti-Cheat on Intel 12th Gen CPUs & Intel SmartSound drivers are also affected.\n- A Subset of Western Digital NVME SSDs are affected as well.\nSometimes, some Windows updates make you think you're better off without the updates. One of the major update rollouts, version 24H2, has been causing severe issues in several places, so much so that some users have reported BSODs. Here are some of the more common problems and how to fix them.\nASUS Laptops and Certain Processor Configurations Are at Risk\nTwo budget laptops from ASUS, the X415KA and X515KA, have been hit with BSOD problems after the Windows 11 24H2 update. However, the problem isn't limited to ASUS machines, although they were the first ones to report the issue. It has popped up on several other systems, primarily due to a firmware conflict.\nMachines running the Intel Celeron N4500 and Intel Pentium Silver N6000 processors are also experiencing a similar BSOD. While these chips won't make the list of best CPUs for 2024, they're present in many entry-level and student machines, making this a pretty aggravating situation.\nPotential Fixes\nASUS has advised its users that it's waiting on a firmware update before they can update their Windows machines without the BSOD happening. If you've already installed the update, you may want to roll it back using System Restore (if possible).\nIf you haven't updated, you should avoid doing so until that firmware fix from ASUS comes through. Ideally, you should pause your Windows Updates so you don't accidentally update automatically.\nIntegrated Cameras Stuttering and Crashing\nIf you own a laptop, chances are that you have an integrated camera system. The Windows 11 24H2 update causes those camera apps to freeze and crash out. Microsoft's support forum has highlighted several of these issues including:\n- When an app accesses the camera, the entire operating system hangs.\n- Using Windows Hello for authentication fails completely.\n- Any third-party facial recognition system may either cause the OS to hang or blue-screen immediately.\nPotential Fixes\nIf you're using Windows Hello to log in, consider using something else, at least temporarily. Windows 11 offers several ways to log in, including a password or a PIN system. If you forget your Windows PIN because you haven't used it in a while, there are ways to reset it so you can get into your system.\nIf you're using facial recognition on your laptop, it's better to disable it temporarily. To do this, navigate to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in Options. Under Face Recognition (Windows Hello), you should see Remove to disable the feature temporarily. You can set it back up afterward.\nIf all else fails, you can use Windows Restore to roll back to a previous version, provided you have a backup.\nEasy Anti-Cheat (EAC) Conflicts\nEasy Anti-Cheat (EAC) has had its issues with Linux, but this Windows update is also not being very nice to it. Systems running Intel's Alder Lake (12th Gen) processors and those with vPro technology are being affected. At the moment, games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and iRacing use EAC, so if you play those games, updating to the latest Windows version might not be a good idea.\nPotential Fixes\nWhile EAC has yet to update any known fixes, updating to the latest version might help. Getting rid of EAC is not an option, especially if you're a gamer, since you won't be able to play online without it. However, it's a good chance that your system isn't even affected.\nTo verify your system is affected, keep an eye out for an error message from the BSOD if it pops up. This issue affects your system if the message contains \"MEMORY_MANAGEMENT\" as part of the stop code. Ideally, using Windows 11 System Restore to roll back to an earlier version is the best way to deal with this.\nIntel SmartSound Technology Drivers\nThe Windows 11 24H2 update has also caused issues in Intel's SmartSound technology (SST), specifically in IntcAudioBus.sys driver. The SST driver deals with audio processing on Intel's Core and Atom processors. Luckily, not all SST users are affected, only those with an Intel 11th Gen Core processor and a specific version of the driver file (10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152). Luckily, this is a simple fix.\nPotential Fixes\nThe easiest fix for this problem is to update your driver file to the current version. You can even use Windows Update to get that update directly without worrying about manually updating. If you prefer doing a manual update, you can get the updated driver package from Intel's download center.\nWestern Digital NVME SSD Problem\nIf you're running a Western Digital NVME SSD, you might encounter a BSOD after the update. The Windows 11 24H2 update changes how the operating system handles the Host Memory Buffer (HMB) on these DRAM-less drives.\nPotential Fixes\nThis one is also pretty easy to fix, as Western Digital has released a firmware update for these DRAM-less drives. While this is usually a good thing, this firmware update risks corrupting all the data on the drive. If you have a drive you can use as a backup, maybe consider copying your data before applying the update.\nThere's an alternative fix, but it requires fiddling around with your registry. Anyone who doesn't know what they're doing should avoid using this fix. Even those who attempt it should back up their registry before changing values. This is how you fix the problem temporarily:\n- Back up your registry, then open the Registry Editor by hitting Windows+R and typing regedit in the window.\n-\nGo to\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\StorPort\nin Registry Editor. -\nFind a DWORD named\nHmbAllocationPolicy.\n- If the DWORD doesn't exist, create it.\n- Modify the DWORD value to either 0 or 2. 0 disables HMB allocation, and 2 sets it to 64.\n- Reboot your machine.\nThis should solve the problem without the risk of corrupting your data.\nUpdate Release Suspended\nMicrosoft has realized the update had been causing issues and has suspended releasing it to users. However, many people have already updated, thanks to automatic updates. If you're dealing with a BSOD after Windows 11 24H2, then these might fix your problem, or at least inform you about it.\nIf your issue isn't on the list, then you're not completely out of luck. Situations like this are why system restore points exist, and you should use them to recover your operating system to its previous functionality. We can only hope that Microsoft sorts out this problem before they come up with another Windows update that breaks the operating system again."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- The Control Panel is still necessary on Windows 11 because not all settings are available in the Settings app.\n- You can open the Control Panel using the Start Menu, Run menu, Command Prompt, or by pinning it to the taskbar.\n- To add a Control Panel desktop icon, go to Settings, navigate to Personalization > Themes > Desktop Icon Settings, then check \"Control Panel\" in the window.\nWhen you want to change settings in Windows 11, you usually reach for the Settings app. But the trusty Control Panel still plays an important role during many configuration tasks. Here are several different ways to open it.\nWhy Use the Control Panel on Windows 11?\nNot every option available in the Control Panel is accessible in the Setting app yet, and you'll often find that items in the Settings app literally just redirect you to the Control Panel anyway. In many cases, it is just faster to go straight to the Control Panel rather skim through the Settings app trying to determine if the option you're looking for has migrated over.\nUse the Start Menu to Open Control Panel\nOne of the easiest ways to launch Control Panel is by using the Start menu. To do so, click the Start button on your taskbar and type \"control panel.\" Click the \"Control Panel\" icon that appears in the results, and Control Panel will launch immediately.\nUse the Run Menu or Command Prompt to Access the Control Panel\nYou can also launch Control Panel from the Run menu. Press Windows+R on your keyboard, and when the Run window pops up, type \"control\", and then click \"OK\" or press Enter. Similarly, you can open Control Panel from the Command Prompt or Windows Terminal by typing \"control\" and pressing Enter.\nPin the Control Panel to the Taskbar\nOnce you've opened Control Panel using any of the methods described above, its icon will appear in your taskbar. If you'd like to keep it there so you can launch it from your taskbar later, right-click the Control Panel icon and select \"Pin to Taskbar.\" The next time you'd like to launch Control Panel, click the icon in your taskbar.\nAdd a Control Panel Desktop Icon\nYou can also add a special desktop icon for Control Panel. To do so, press Windows+i to open Settings, then navigate to Personalization > Themes and click \"Desktop Icon Settings.\" In the Desktop Icon Settings window that opens, place a checkmark beside \"Control Panel,\" and then click \"OK.\" The icon will appear on your desktop. To launch Control Panel, double-click the desktop icon at any time. Good luck!"

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\nTo upgrade or replace your PC's RAM, consult your PC's manual or use Speccy to identify what kind of RAM your PC uses, and how many slots it has available. Buy suitable RAM, then open your PC and firmly seat your new RAM in the RAM slots on your motherboard.\nAdding memory is one of the easier ways to boost your PC's performance. There are a few things to check before spending your money, though, so let's talk about them.\nChoosing Your New RAM\nAs with most things about upgrading your PC, figuring out what you need and then doing some comparison shopping is the hard part. After that, physically installing your new memory is a breeze by comparison. Here are some of the things you'll need to figure out when making your decision.\nHow Much RAM Do You Need?\nGenerally speaking, more RAM is better. That said, the law of diminishing returns applies. Moving from 8 GB to 16 GB of RAM is likely to make a huge difference. Moving from 16 GB to 32 GB still shows some good gains in performance, but not as much. And moving beyond 32 GB is going to be a smaller boost still. Of course, some of that depends on what you use your PC for.\nRight now, we generally recommend at least 16 GB of RAM for most people. That's kind of the sweet spot for how the majority of people use their PCs. If you're a gamer, or you often multitask lots of bigger programs, you'll probably want 32 GB GB, if that fits in your budget.\nAnd, if you work with large media files (like projects in Photoshop or Lightroom), you use virtual machines on your PC, or have other specialized needs, you'll want as much RAM as you can afford (and that your PC can physically accommodate).\nHow Much RAM Do You Have Now (and In What Configuration)?\nIt's easy enough to pop open your Settings app, head to the \"About This PC\" section, and see how much RAM you have.\nThat only tells part of the story, though. That 32 GB listed in the screenshot above (yes, it's a lot---this system is used to run multiple virtual machines at the same time) might be four modules of 8 GB each, or it might be two modules of 16 GB each. That matters when you're upgrading because memory is typically installed in pairs, and different systems can have different numbers of slots available.\nFor example, let's assume we wanted to upgrade that system to even more RAM. We now need to know some additional information. How many total memory slots does the PC have? How many RAM modules are installed? Are there free slots?\nFor that, you could open up your case and count the number of modules and slots inside, or you could turn to another tool. There are several hardware information tools out there, but our favorite is the free version Speccy (made by Piriform, the makers of CCleaner).\nAfter installing and running Speccy, we just switch to the RAM category on the left, and the right panel shows us gives us the info we need.\nUnfortunately, we can now see that we have four total slots available and that all four are taken up with memory modules. Since we have 32 GB total RAM, we can assume that we have four 8 GB modules in place. This means that to get more RAM in the machine, we need to replace some or all of what's there.\nIf we had found that only two slots were taken up by two 16 GB RAM modules, we could have simply added another pair of modules---two 8 GB modules for a total of 48 GB, or two more 16 GB modules for a total of 64 GB.\nHow Much RAM Can Your PC Handle?\nThe other part of the RAM equation is knowing how much total RAM your computer can support. There are two factors here: the maximum RAM your version of Windows can handle, and the maximum that your motherboard can handle. Whatever is lower is what you're stuck with, but it's typically the motherboard that's the more limiting factor.\nThe Windows part is easy:\n- 32-bit Windows: 32-bit versions of Windows 10 can only handle up to 4 GB of RAM, no matter whether you're running the Home, Professional, or Enterprise edition. The same holds true for Windows 7.\n- 64-bit Windows: 64-bit versions of Windows can handle up to 128 GB for Windows 10 Home, and up to 2 TB for Windows 10 Education, Professional, or Enterprise. On Windows 7, things were a bit different. The Home Basic edition can handle up to 8 GB, Home Premium up to 16 GB, and Professional up to 192 GB.\nThe second part of the equation (how much your motherboard can handle) depends entirely on the manufacturer, though most modern computers will support at least 32 GB, and more likely 64 GB or more.\nYou'll need to check the documentation for your motherboard or PC for the details. If you're unsure what motherboard you have, you can again turn to Speccy, where the Motherboard category shows you the information you need.\nJust hit up Google with your model number and you should find what you're after.\nWhat Type of RAM Does Your PC Require?\nYou're also going to need to determine what type of RAM your computer can use. And there are a few parts to that puzzle, as well.\nFirst up, RAM for desktops usually comes in DIMM modules (the longer stick pictured on top in the image below). RAM for laptops---and some ultra compact desktops---comes in smaller SODIMM modules (the shorter one on the bottom in the image below).\nNext, check the generation of RAM your computer's motherboard accepts. This information is presented as a DDR version:\n- DDR2: This generation was introduced in 2003. Chances are your computer is not using DDR2 memory unless it's an extremely old system.\n- DDR3: This generation was introduced in 2007. It's mostly only seen in older PCs.\n- DDR4: This generation was introduced around 2014. It's found in plenty of computers built after 2014, and remains common in 2023.\n- DDR5: DDR5 was officially released in 2020 but wasn't supported by consumer motherboards and CPUs until 2021. It is found in enthusiast, prosumer, and professional PCs.\nMotherboards are designed for a specific generation of RAM, so you'll need to determine what you need. You can't just buy the latest DDR5 RAM and stick it in a PC designed for DDR3. In fact, it wouldn't even physically fit. Note the different position of the notches at the bottom of the memory below. They're keyed differently so that can't be inserted into slots not designed for them.\nSome motherboards designed for Intel processors can use both DDR4 and DDR5 RAM, but it isn't safe to make that assumption generally. Always consult the motherboard manual to be sure before you make a purchase.\nSo, the next obvious question. How do you know which generation you need? The answer, of course, is that we're going to turn to Speccy again. Switch back on the RAM category on the left. On the right, at the bottom, expand the \"SPD\" entry. And right there, you can see the generation, size, manufacturer, and model number of each RAM module you have installed.\nSo now we know that this PC uses DDR4 memory.\nWhat About RAM Speed and Latency?\nIf you go shopping for (or reading about) memory, you'll also see a couple of other specifications that get talked about a lot: RAM speed and latency (also called timings).\n- RAM Speed: This is based on a rather complicated combination of hardware factors, and the relative speed of RAM is specific within a generation. Speeds are usually labeled using either the older standard (in which case you'll see speeds like PC2/PC3/PC4) or the new standard that also includes a more specific speed rating (in which case a speed would look more like DDR 1600).\n- Latency: This deals with how fast the RAM module can access its own hardware. Lower latency means faster data access. Latency timings are presented as a series of four numbers, so you might see something like 5-5-5-15.\nThe truth, though, is that speed and latency just isn't all that important. Higher speed and lower latency RAM really isn't that much faster than the lower speed, higher latency stuff. You'll find a lot of talk about it from people who like to brag about their systems, but it's pretty safe to ignore. Even with a high performance gaming machine, it just doesn't make that much difference---especially since most of gaming is handled by the RAM on discrete graphics cards.\nThat said, there are a couple of things that are important to keep in mind.\nYour motherboard or PC might limit the speed of the RAM it supports, mostly because it was designed for the RAM that was out at the time the motherboard was manufactured. Check your system specs to see what it can handle. It might even be that you can update your BIOS to support higher speed RAM if you want. Check your manufacturer's website for that.\nFor latency, it's best if you use modules that sport the same latency numbers. It's not critical, especially if you're adding memory to a system. But if you're replacing memory, you might as well get all the same kind.\nWhat About Heat Sinks And RGB?\nThey're mostly meaningless. RGB LEDs on your RAM looks neat in a desktop case with a window (if you're into that sort of thing). And flashy heat sinks might be advantageous if you're planning to overclock your memory. If neither of these things appeal to you, don't look for those specific features---they'll only make your memory more expensive.\nCan I Upgrade My Laptop's RAM?\nUpgrading RAM in a laptops is a trickier subject than with desktops. Some laptops have an access panel that lets you swap out RAM modules easily. Some have one or two RAM slots available through an access panel, while others are tucked away where you can't really get to them. Some laptops require that you pretty much disassemble the whole thing to change the RAM. And some laptops don't have RAM slots at all; their memory is soldered to the motherboard.\nTo figure out which situation applies to you, you're going to have to do some research. Check your user manual, hit up the manufacturer web site, or do some quick Googling---odds are pretty good that the question has been answered for your specific model.\nHow To Upgrade Desktop Memory\nReplacing the memory in your desktop is usually pretty straightforward. You'll need a Philips-head screwdriver to open the case, and that's about it. Note that these instructions are for a standard ATX tower-style case---if you have a more exotic case design, you may need to work a little harder or position the computer oddly to open it and access its internal components.\nRemove all the cables and external accessories from your computer, then move it to a table or desk. Ideally you want a cool, dry work area that isn't carpeted. If your home is particularly susceptible to static shocks, you might want an anti-static bracelet as well.\nRemove the screws on the back holding the access panel in place. You're going to remove the access panel from the left side of the PC (assuming you're looking at the front). On some cases, you'll need to remove the whole cover. Then set the case on it's side with the internals exposed.\nAt this point you should be looking down at the motherboard. The RAM should be easy to spot. It will be two or more modules sticking up from slots that are usually near the CPU, but more toward the front of the computer.\nTo remove the existing RAM, look for the plastic tabs at either end of the RAM slots. Simply press these tabs down (away from the RAM) until they click. The module should pop up slightly, and it's ready to be pulled out. Repeat this step with all the modules you want to remove.\nThen, just lift each module straight up and out of the slot.\nBefore you plug the new RAM in, take a look at the slots. Remember how we said RAM is installed in pairs? Where you install it matters. On the motherboard in the image below, the paired slots are different colors---black for one pair, and gray for the other pair. If you're installing fewer modules than the motherboard holds (or you have two mismatched pairs---like two 8 GB modules and two 4 GB modules), you'll need to install pairs in matching slots.\nSome motherboards use different indicators for slot pairs. Check your specifications if you're unsure.\nTo install the new RAM align the electrical contacts with the memory slot, making sure the notch in the connector is positioned correctly---they can only fit in in one orientation. Then press the memory module into place gently until you hear the plastic tabs on either end of the slot click into place, securing the module.\nIf you unplugged any of the power or data cords on your machine to get better access to the RAM slots, plug them back in now.\nReplace the access panel and screw it back down on the rear of the machine. You're done! Take your machine back to its usual spot and plug everything back in.\nHow To Upgrade Laptop Memory\nBefore you start, you need to determine where the RAM DIMM or DIMMs are on your laptop, and how you'll reach them. The bigger your laptop is, the more likely it is that you'll be able to access the memory without disassembling it completely. The smaller and lighter your laptop is, the more likely it is that the memory is soldered to the motherboard and can't be changed at all. Ultralight laptops almost never have user-accessible memory.\nMost laptops that allow user-accessible memory upgrades to do so either through a small access panel on the bottom of the case, or by performing some level of disassembly (sometimes by removing the entire bottom, sometimes by removing the keyboard, sometimes a combination). Consult your laptop's user manual or do some web searches to find information for your model.\nBefore you start, turn off your laptop and remove all cables, accessories, and batteries.\nMy ThinkPad T450s is pretty middle-of-the-road here: it requires me to remove the battery, take out eight different screws, and pop off the metal bottom to access the RAM. Other designs only require you to remove a single screw, then take off a sectional cover. I only have access to one DIMM slot, the other is soldered to the motherboard.\nTo insert a new DIMM, I have to remove the one that's already in the slot. To do this, I gently pull the two tabs locking down the DIMM on either side. The RAM DIMM springs up at a diagonal angle.\nIn this position, simply grip the card gently and pull it out of the slot. Be careful not to touch the electrical contacts, and set the module aside.\nTo insert the new module, go in at the same angle. (You'll have to eyeball it if you didn't have to remove one). The module should sit in the slot evenly, with no electrical contacts still visible. Next, push down on the module until it's parallel with the housing. The pressure should make the clips clamp down on the module automatically, locking it into place. Repeat these steps with the second module if you're installing more than one at a time.\nThen, you put everything back together. With the battery back in place, you're ready to start your laptop and make sure the operating system recognizes the new RAM.\nChecking Your RAM Installation\nWhen you're finished installing the RAM, you want to make sure it's working correctly. Depending on your PC, the BIOS may display the amount of memory on the initial boot up screen. If you don't see that, you can load into your PC's BIOS or just let your operating system start and then check out the amount of recognized RAM there. In Windows 10, you can just head to Settings > System > About.\nIf your PC is showing less RAM than it should, there are a few possible explanations.\nThe first is that you made a mistake during installation and one or more modules aren't fully seated. To solve this, simply go back and double-check that all the modules are fully inserted into their slots.\nThe next possibility is that the RAM isn't compatible with your motherboard (perhaps the wrong generation), or you installed a module that has a capacity higher than its slot allows. You need to go back to the compatibility checks and make sure you're using the correct RAM.\nAnd finally, if all else fails, it's possible that you have a bad memory module, which will need to be replaced."

      "text": "Quick Links\nIf you've been using your graphics card for a while, there's a good chance it's no longer running as cool and quiet as it did when it was new. In extreme cases, you might even experience degraded performance or crashes. Regular dusting helps, but it doesn't fully address the issue\u2014the thermal paste and pads inside the card have dried out and are no longer doing their job properly.\nThermal paste and pads play a crucial role in cooling, as they help transfer heat away from your graphics card's crucial components. When these materials degrade, the card can start to overheat. Fortunately, replacing them is both cheap and straightforward. Here are a few reasons why it's worth considering.\nOpening your GPU is risky and can cause permanent damage if not done properly, so it's best to have a professional handle it. It also voids your warranty\u2014if your GPU is still under warranty and overheating, you might want to consider an RMA instead.\n9 Thermal Paste and Pads Degrade Over Time\nOver time, the thermal paste inside your graphics card will dry out, regardless of its quality. This is inevitable, as the paste undergoes thousands of heat cycles throughout its lifespan. As it dries and hardens, it begins to break down microscopically, forming tiny air pockets that reduce thermal transfer efficiency.\nThermal pads are slightly more durable, but they also degrade as the silicone material loses elasticity, shrinks, and becomes brittle over time.\nAOK Technologies, a manufacturer of thermal interface materials (TIMs), states that thermal paste typically lasts around 3\u20135 years (longer for high-quality paste or phase-change thermal pads), while regular thermal pads can last around 5\u201310 years.\nThis means that replacing the thermal paste is generally more important than replacing the pads, as pads could technically last the lifespan of the card. However, if you're already opening the card to replace the paste, and the card is nearing the five-year mark, I recommend replacing the pads as well.\nArctic MX-4 GPU Thermal Paste\nThe Arctic MX-4 is a budget-friendly, high-performance thermal paste suitable for both GPUs and CPUs. It's non-conductive, meaning it won't short out circuits if it spreads onto surrounding components, making it a safe and easy option to work with.\n8 Achieve Improved Cooling Performance\nReplacing your graphics card's thermal paste and pads can lead to a noticeable improvement in cooling performance, especially if it's already been running for a few years. As the materials degrade, they become less efficient at transferring heat from the GPU, VRAM, and VRMs to the heatsink, causing the card to run hotter. Additionally, rumor has it that some board manufacturers use cheaper, generic thermal paste that doesn't perform as well or last as long as the branded stuff you'd buy in a syringe.\nThat's why replacing your GPU's thermal paste is a simple but direct upgrade that doesn't require significant investment. Even budget-friendly thermal paste options from reputable brands like Arctic MX-4 or Corsair TM30 can yield noticeable improvements of a few degrees.\nIf you're looking for maximum cooling performance, consider opting for a high-end paste like the Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (also available in an affordable 1g package). According to tests by Tiny Tech Tweaks, it offers a small but still meaningful cooling improvement of around 1.6\u00baC compared to the Arctic MX-4.\nThermal Grizzly Kryonaut Thermal Paste\nThermal Grizzly's Kryonaut paste is a balanced, well-performing option that aims to provide the best thermal transfer possible. Paired with a solid cooling solution, it's one of the best thermal pastes your money can buy.\nDon't overlook the importance of aftermarket thermal pads, either. For instance, TekShinji compared several pads and found that high-end options like the Gelid Solutions GP-Ultimate 15W reduced the memory junction temperatures on the RTX 3090 FE from 98\u00baC to 84\u00baC\u2014a shocking difference.\n7 Increase FPS in Games\nLowering GPU and VRAM temperatures can translate into real-world performance improvements. Your GPU and VRAM always aim to run at their highest possible clock speeds (boost clock). However, as temperatures rise, they dynamically reduce clock speeds to generate less heat and stay within safe temperature limits.\nThis process is called thermal throttling. It helps prevent overheating, but it also means worse performance. However, unless your graphics card is severely overheating, it's not an extreme difference. Expect slightly lower FPS or longer rendering times, rather than a drastic slowdown. But how much FPS are we actually talking about?\nYouTuber Nexus Tech replaced the thermal paste on their old NVIDIA GTX 770 and saw a 5% performance improvement. When I replaced the thermal paste and pads on my used RX 6800 XT, I ran some quick before-and-after benchmarks in Red Dead Redemption 2 and saw an impressive 9.5% improvement in average FPS, along with an ~8\u00baC max temperature drop on the GPU and VRAM, according to MSI Afterburner.\nNote that my second-hand graphics card was heavily used for four years, so the thermal paste and pads were in poor condition. Both were completely dried out and hardened. Moreover, my tests were rather quick and informal, so your mileage may vary.\n6 Extend Your Graphics Card\u2019s Lifespan\nThe lifespan of your GPU, VRAM, and VRMs is directly related to how much overheating they're exposed to. When electronic components heat up, they expand, and when they cool down, they contract.\nAlthough your graphics card is designed to handle these temperature cycles, prolonged physical stress can still cause the internals to wear out over time. Hotspots are especially dangerous, as even a single broken VRM or VRAM chip is very difficult and expensive to repair, if it's even possible.\nAn ounce of prevention is well worth it here. Keeping your graphics card cool by replacing its thermal paste and pads periodically protects your expensive investment.\n5 Increase the Resale Value\nOnce it's time to upgrade your graphics card, you can recoup some of the cost by selling your old one. Not only will a card whose thermal paste and pads have been replaced be more likely to survive its time with you, but it will also have a slightly better resale value.\nWhen listing the card on Facebook Marketplace or eBay, don\u2019t hesitate to mention in the description that you\u2019ve replaced the thermal paste and pads. This will show buyers that you took good care of the graphics card by preventing it from overheating.\n4 Reduce Fan Noise\nRemember, the main job of the thermal paste and pads is to improve the thermal contact between the graphics card's integral components and the heatsink, allowing for efficient heat transfer. When these compounds degrade, the graphics card runs hotter, so the fans have to work harder to keep the card cool.\nThe problem is that the fans aren't doing much at that point because the issue lies elsewhere\u2014the heatsink can't remove the heat away from the components efficiently. As a result, the fans are spinning unnecessarily fast and creating noise without being used to their fullest potential.\nReplaced compounds improve heat transfer, and the fans only need to ramp up when required. Plus, the heat dissipation becomes more consistent, meaning the fans won't have to ramp up and down constantly (which is more annoying than loud fans in the first place). You can combine the fresh paste and pads with a custom GPU fan curve to optimize the GPU for maximum cooling performance, silence, or a mix of both.\n3 Improve Overall System Stability\nThe benefits of a cooler graphics card go beyond improved performance and less fan noise. Another major advantage is enhanced system stability. A hot graphics card is more likely to crash, as excessive heat can lead to instability, long-term component wear, and, in severe cases, thermal shutdown, which protects the card from permanent damage.\nYou might think that your card is crashing due to inferior drivers from your graphics card brand or a poorly developed game, but overheating could actually be the real culprit. By replacing the thermal pads and paste on the GPU, VRAM, and\u2014most importantly\u2014VRMs, you can reduce application crashes, random stutters, and shutdowns, leading to more stable system performance.\n2 Unlock Overclocking Potential for GPU and VRAM\nFor those who love squeezing every ounce of performance out of their hardware, like myself, you'll be happy to learn that fresh thermal materials keep temperatures in check, even at high clock speeds. By pushing your components to their limits, you're more likely to encounter power or design constraints rather than just thermal limitations.\nBased on my experience, you can expect a 5\u201310% performance improvement above the graphics card's stock boost clocks, depending on the make, model, and your specific card. Don't forget to overclock the VRAM in addition to the GPU, as it can also provide a few extra FPS. Your new thermal pads will help keep the VRAM cool and stable, even at higher speeds.\n1 Replacing Thermal Paste and Pads Is Easier Than You Think\nOn top of all the benefits from this list, the last reason you should consider replacing the thermal pads and paste is that it's a rather easy and straightforward procedure. The entire process only takes around 30\u201340 minutes and is something you'll probably only have to do once throughout the card's ownership. It's the first thing I do when I buy a used graphics card.\nAll you need is a steady hand and a few basic PC repair tools. A precision screwdriver set with spudgers will ensure you have the right screwdriver bit for every graphics card screw, while the spudgers allow you to safely remove a stuck-on heatsink.\nGood preparation is the most critical step in the disassembly procedure. Even if you\u2019ve disassembled graphics cards before, you must use thermal pads of the correct thickness that the heatsink was designed for.\nFor example, using a 1mm pad on VRAM modules designed for 2mm pads will compromise proper contact between the heatsink and chips. While stacking two 1mm pads can work, unless the pads are specifically designed to stack, this will increase thermal resistance, and the pads can compress and wear unevenly.\nARCTIC TP-3 Premium Performance Thermal Pad\nThe ARCTIC TP-3 is a high-quality thermal pad that can keep your VRAM and VRMs cool by ensuring proper contact between the sensitive components and the heatsink. This pad is stackable up to 2mm, allowing you to buy one thickness pad and adjust as necessary.\nTo ensure everything goes smoothly, watch disassembly videos of your specific graphics card model and check forum posts to see the exact disassembly steps and what thickness pads your card uses.\nReplacing your graphics card's thermal paste and pads is a simple yet effective way to improve the performance, stability, and longevity of this expensive component. This is especially if your card is old, or you bought it used, and it has an unknown maintenance history. Don't be afraid to get the tools out and do it yourself, or take it to a technician if you're uncomfortable. Either way, keeping your GPU adequately cooled is a smart investment in its lifespan and resale value."

Here's how.\nUsing BIOS/UEFI\nOne built-in method to find your CPU's temp on some computers is by using your machine's UEFI menu, often referred to as the BIOS. This menu displays various information about your system, sometimes including your processor's temperature.\nNote that there's a minor drawback of this method: this method shows your CPU temp when Windows 11 isn't loaded. Which means, if you're trying to find out if a particular app or game is causing your CPU to heat up, you won't be able to investigate that issue with this method. Additionally, not all BIOS menus provide CPU temperatures, so depending on your device you may not find anything useful.\nThat said, if you'd like to try using this method, open your Windows 11 PC's Settings app by pressing Windows+i. From the left sidebar, select \"System.\" On the right pane, choose \"Recovery.\"\nOn the \"Recovery\" page, next to \"Advanced Startup,\" click \"Restart Now.\" Then, in the open prompt, select \"Restart Now.\"\nYour PC will turn off, so make sure you've saved your unsaved work in your open apps.\nWhen your PC turns back on, in the open menu, navigate to Troubleshoot > UEFI Firmware Settings and click \"Restart.\" You'll enter the BIOS/UEFI menu.\nHere, you might find your CPU's current temperature next to the \"CPU Core Temperature\" or a similar option. If you don't find this option on your BIOS/UEFI's main page, check out the other tabs, like \"Advanced.\" If you can't find any temperatures, use one of the third-party tools demonstrated below.\nUsing Core Temp\nCore Temp app is a free app that lets you check your CPU's temp from both the app's main screen as well as from your system tray. It also displays the temperature for each core of your CPU, which is handy in some cases.\nTo use the app, visit the Core Temp site in your web browser and download and install the app on your PC. While installing, make sure to deselect the \"Build Your Kingdom\" option that installs junkware on your computer.\nRun the Core Temp app. In the app's \"Temperature Readings\" section, you'll see your current CPU temp.\nThe temp numbers are constantly updating, as your CPU's temp keeps fluctuating.\nA quick way to see your CPU temp without opening the app interface is by clicking the app in your system tray. You'll see each core's temp right in your system tray.\nUsing Speccy to Check CPU Temperature\nAnother popular and free app you can use to find your CPU's temp in Windows 11 is Speccy. This app lets you check your CPU temp as well as find other insights of your PC.\nTo use it, open your web browser and head to the Speccy site. Download and install the app on your PC.\nLaunch the newly-installed app. On the app's main page, in the \"CPU\" section, you'll see your CPU's overall temperature.\nTo find each core's temp, then in the app's left sidebar, click \"CPU.\" On the right pane, in the \"Cores\" section, you'll see the temperature of each CPU core.\nUsing Open Hardware Monitor\nOpen Hardware Monitor is a free and open-source app that you can use to check your CPU's temperature as well as find other information about your PC components.\nTo use this app, head to the Open Hardware Monitor's site and download the app. Extract the app's ZIP file on your PC.\nOpen the folder where you've extracted the ZIP, right-click the \"OpenHardwareMonitor.exe\" file, and select \"Run as Administrator.\" You need to run the app with admin rights because using the temp and other sensors requires admin access.\nIn the \"User Account Control\" prompt, select \"Yes.\"\nOn the app screen, in the \"Temperatures\" section, you'll find the temp of each core of your CPU.\nThe app also displays other useful information, like the temperature of your hard drive or SSD drive.\nCheck Your CPU Temp in Windows 11 with HWiNFO\nHWiNFO is another good program that lets you view your CPU temperature, in addition to specs about every component in your PC. You can install HWiNFO or use the portable version. Once you launch the program, select \"Sensors-only\" and then click \"Start.\"\nScroll through the list of the devices until you see \"CPU\" related terms. It'll show you the current temperature in addition to the minimum and maximum temperature.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat's a normal temp for my CPU?\nThe normal temp for your CPU varies by what you're doing on your PC. If you're running a processor-intensive app or game, your CPU temp naturally will rise. It's ideal, however, if your CPU's temp stays around 75 degrees Celsius (167 degrees Fahrenheit).\nWhat's the maximum temperature for a CPU?\nThe maximum CPU temperature varies by the CPU model you have. You can use a free app like Speccy to find out the maximum recommended temp for your specific processor. Generally speaking, Intel CPUs max out around 100 degrees Celsius, and AMD CPUs at 90 degrees Celsius.\nHow do you reduce a CPU's temperature?\nSome ways to reduce your CPU's temperature include closing CPU-intensive apps or games if you don't use them, cleaning your PC so there's good airflow inside, and using a CPU cooling gadget. These can include fans, liquid cooling, and AIO coolers."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\nA loud PC is likely due to fan noise. Reducing heat with more efficient airflow, better PC placement, and cleaning can help reduce noise. You can also manually control your fans, replace noisy and inefficient coolers, or swap out clicky hard drives for silent solid-state drives instead.\nDoes your computer sound like a jet engine? Maybe you've noticed some rattling, drones, or whines you've not heard before. Let's take a look at what causes a PC or laptop to get noisy, and what you can do about it.\nWhy Do Computers Make So Much Noise?\nYour computer should make the most noise when it's under load. Expect a lot more fan noise when you're doing things like playing games or running software that taxes your computer like video editors or media converters. This is normal behavior, where fans ramp up to dissipate heat quickly.\nYou can help this process along by improving airflow inside your case. It's important to have designated intake and exhaust points within your fan. Ideally, you want one side of your case to suck in cool air and another to exhaust it. You can control this airflow by placing case fans inside your computer.\nYou should also make sure that your PC can breathe wherever it's placed. Stuffing your case in an enclosed space like a media unit or a cupboard can cause heat to build up within the confinement. Instead of sucking in cool air, your PC will continue to suck in warm which will make the fans work harder to dissipate heat and create more noise.\nMake sure your PC has lots of room around it. If this isn't possible, consider installing fans into your media unit or wherever the PC lives to help exchange hot air for cool air. Follow the same principle as your case: intakes for cool air, exhaust points to remove warm air.\nReducing the ambient temperature can also help. Open a window to allow cool air into the room, or in the warmer months consider running the AC for a few hours a day to take the edge off. All sorts of devices can contribute to the ambient temperature including monitors and TVs, network equipment, and storage devices.\nFix 1: Blow Out the Cobwebs\nClean your PC case to remove dust, fluff, and other debris that's become trapped inside. This acts as an insulator, trapping warm air around some of the hottest components in your computer case. Don't forget to also clean fans, coolers, and heatsinks which can also become clogged.\nYou can clean your PC with a can of compressed air. Doing this regularly is essential if you have pets that shed hair. To make things easier, consider installing dust filters over the intakes. You can buy cheap magnetic dust filters that snap on, or order cut-to-size rolls specifically for your case. Some manufacturers (like Corsair) even make filters for specific cases.\nMagnetic PC Fan Dust Filter\nSnap-on dust filters for your computer case air intakes, designed to cut down on the number of unwanted particles that enter your case.\nIf you go the dust filter route you will need to make sure that you clean the filters regularly to ensure that the PC can still breathe. Dust and fluff can quickly clog up your filters, which in the short term can be worse since it will block off intakes completely.\nLaptops can get noisy for this reason too since the channels inside the chassis through which heat exchange takes place can be narrow and easily clogged. You might be able to open up your laptop to clean it, but be aware this will often void any warranty and that not all laptops are easy to reassemble.\nFix 2: Control Your Fans\nYou can monitor core components for heat to see how hot things are getting. This is especially useful if you do it while your computer is under load, to ensure that your current cooling is adequate. Apps like CPU-Z and GPU-Z (as well as manufacturer-specific graphics card utilities) can give you an idea of how hot things are getting.\nDifferent components are rated for different maximum temperatures, and you'll find the exact maximum temperatures for your particular hardware listed on the manufacturer's specifications. For a CPU, expect a temperature range of between 104\u00baF and 176\u00baF (40\u00baC and 80\u00baC) while under load. Temperatures higher than 194\u00baF (90\u00baC) mean your processor is getting too hot.\nThe same is true for your GPU. The manufacturer will specify maximum temperatures, but as a rule of thumb, expect around 158\u00baF (70\u00baC) when playing a challenging game, with sustained temperatures above 185\u00baF (85\u00baC) considered too hot for most graphics cards.\nIf you're happy with your current temperatures and are convinced that your fan setup is adequate, your case isn't clogged with dust, and your fans are still making too much noise you can control them. How you do this depends on components like your motherboard, GPU, and the fans you have installed in your case.\nHow your fans connect to your computer can impact what you can do to control them. Sometimes it's a case of digging through your BIOS settings, other times you might be able to use an app like SpeedFan to control your fans from within Windows. Utilities like MSI Afterburner can help you control your GPU fans separately using profiles or curves.\nBe careful when doing this since the slower your fans, the slower hot air will be exchanged for cool air. Less noise generally means higher temperatures, so make sure you find the right balance since heat can cause stability issues in the short term and reduce the lifespan of your components over time.\nFix 3: Replace Noisy Case Fans\nIf your fan is making a droning noise, the bearings may have failed and it's probably time to replace it. If you're hearing a clicking or buzzing noise, a cable may be caught on a fan blade so open up your case and carefully inspect all of your fans to see if you can spot any obvious problems. You can turn your computer on when the case is open to better isolate the problem.\nYou could also try replacing some of your noisier fans with fancier models. Generally speaking, larger fans don't have to work as hard as smaller fans since the larger blades are more efficient at moving air. This means they can run at slower speeds. Make sure you've got room in your case for this. Fan sizes are measured in millimeters, like 90mm, 120mm, or even 140mm.\nNoctua NF-P12 Cooling Fan (120mm)\nThis high-performance computer fan with a 4.8-star rating on Amazon is perfect for low-noise chassis ventilation.\nSome manufacturers have made a name for themselves by creating quiet fans. Noctua and be quiet! are two such examples, but other companies create models that are designed to be as quiet as possible including Corsair (who create Quiet Edition fans), Cooler Master (particularly the Silencio), and Arctic.\nFix 4: Replace Noisy CPU Coolers\nStock CPU coolers can be noisy and inadequate, sometimes both. They might create a lot of noise due to small fans that have to spin at high speeds while lacking enough metal to dissipate heat sufficiently. Investing in a quality cooler for your CPU can fix both of these issues, all for under $100 (sometimes much less).\nAir coolers don't have to be loud, even though they use fast-moving fans to dissipate heat. Switching your stock CPU cooler for something a little more premium like the Noctua NH-U12S or the be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4 should reduce in better cooling and less noise. And don't forget to pick up some quality thermal paste while you're at it!\nbe quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4\nThe Dark Rock Pro 4 from be quiet! registers only 24.3 decibels at maximum speed. Compatible with AMD AM4 and AM5 or Intel 1700, 1200 2066, 1150, 1151, 1155, 2011(-3).\nWater cooling is another solid option if your budget can go a little further. AIO (all-in-one) coolers still require fans, but the overall operation is still a lot quieter than comparable air coolers. Airflow is essential for exhausting heat stored in the radiator, so you'll need to dedicate space along one edge of your case for the radiator if you go for something like the NZXT Kraken X63, Corsair H100i, or Lian Li Galahad 240 AIO.\nNZXT Kraken X63 280mm\nNZXT's all-in-one liquid cooler registers 21 to 36 decibels while in use, just make sure you have room for the attached radiator. Compatible with AMD AM4 and AM5 sockets, or Intel LGA 1151, 1150, 1155, 1156, 1366, 2011(-3), 2066.\nYou can replace a GPU cooler and the thermal paste on which it sits too, but this isn't quite as straightforward as a CPU cooler swap. You'll need to find coolers that fit your graphics card, and changing the cooler will likely void any warranty you have left. The gains may not make much sense financially, and your money may be better spent on an upgrade down the line.\nIf your GPU fan is frequently spinning at maximum speed, the first thing to check is the airflow near that part of the case. You may be able to improve thermals (and noise) by installing a cheap case fan instead.\nFix 5: Pick a Quiet PC Case and Power Supply\nAnother upgrade you can perform is to change your PC case to one designed to minimize unwanted noise. A good case will last you many years and see you through several major upgrades (as long as there's enough room for whatever you're upgrading to).\nbe quiet! cases are especially good at this, with products at several different price points and sizes depending on your needs. Start with a budget-friendly option like the Pure Base 600 or splash out on the Dark Base 900 with pre-installed fans. Other brands like Corsair also create silent cases (like the Corsair 100R Silent Edition) as does Fractal Design (consider the Define and Define Mini ranges).\nbe quiet! Pure Base 600 Black\nA case designed to dampen sounds can help reduce the overall noise level of any PC, plus it's a component you can make use of time and time again.\nYour power supply shouldn't make a ton of noise but like many other components in your PC, it uses a fan to dissipate heat. be quiet! also make power supplies like the Straight Power 11, while Thermaltake's Smart PSU is another solid choice. Corsair's RMX Series is another good choice, with a zero RPM fan mode for temporary passive cooling.\nFix 6: Replace Your Hard Drive With an SSD\nHard drives are much noisier than their solid-state counterparts, especially failing hard drives. Though they're a cost-effective way of adding storage, they're slow, prone to failure, and noisy when reading and writing. The audible clicking noise is the sound of the mechanical arm moving across the platter, and the \"spinning up\" noise is the platter getting up to speed after a period of inactivity.\nYou can solve this by replacing your hard drives with solid-state drives. You don't even need to spend big on these if they're simply used as storage for media and other files. Something like the Samsung 870 EVO SATA III 1TB 2.5\" internal drive offers a big upgrade over an equivalent hard drive, or you can go for a faster Samsung 980 NVMe M.2 (PCIe 3.0x4) for around the same price.\nSamsung 870 EVO 1TB SATA 3 SSD\nReplace your noisy SATA hard drives with the Samsung 870 EVO and kiss goodbye to those annoying clicking and spinning noises.\nFix 7: Drown the Noise Out\nIf you can't get over the sound your laptop makes, consider drowning it out with some of the best computer speakers money can buy. Alternatively, get a good pair of headphones instead. Moving a PC tower to a different room from where you're working is entirely doable too with the right tools\nFinally, a mechanical keyboard can complete your setup but make sure you know the difference between the different types of switches so that you don't pick something too noisy or tactile for your tastes."
