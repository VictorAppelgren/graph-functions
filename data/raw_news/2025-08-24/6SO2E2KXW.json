  "description": "A tenant rights lawyer says a San Francisco landlord is legally allowed to limit rental viewings to MAGA voters and Israel supporters amid the city's housing crisis.",
  "content": "A lawyer says a landlord has the right to only allow \"MAGA voters and Israel supporters\" to attend an open house.\n\n\"From the tenant perspective, there isn't a violation here of California or federal law because political orientation is not a protected class,\" Joseph Tobener, a and tenant rights lawyer, told Fox News Digital on Thursday.\n\n\"So things that it might touch upon that are protected class would be ethnicity, source of income, religion,\" he added. \"So there's some things that skirts around, but the words were such that they are all political orientation, which isn't a protected class and not a violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act in California. Now, with that said, I think what rubs people the wrong way is that we have a new housing shortage in San Francisco because of the AI boom.\"\n\nThe San Francisco Standard reported Tuesday that Alexander Baran, 48, owns a two-bedroom apartment in Sunnyside and had listed it on Zillow, which has since been taken down.\n\nThe listing, which went up Aug. 5 and was removed on Sunday, allegedly said that \"Only and Israel supporters are invited\" to the open house.\n\nWhen the San Francisco Standard went to visit Baran to speak to him about the listing, he allegedly said, \"Get the f--- away from here. Don\u2019t make me repeat myself.\"\n\nTobener, the tenant rights lawyer, said that the City by the Bay is \"about a month into a major housing crisis where people are lining up 20 deep for a unit to try and get one unit or showing up and the unit's already rented.\"\n\nCUOMO PROPOSES 'ZOHRAN'S LAW' TO PROTECT RENT-STABILIZED HOUSING FROM THE WEALTHY\n\nThe concern that people have, he said, is landlords rejecting people that need housing due to their political views.\n\n\"Landlords have a lot of power right now. And so I think that's the concern from the tenant perspective,\" Tobener said. \"Everybody should get a fair shake regardless of their political orientation. Everyone should be able to get access to housing. Housing is a fundamental right. Everyone needs housing. Everyone needs a roof over their heads. And so are we gonna start down this road where only certain people from certain political leanings can get access to certain housing.\"\n\nTo change the law and make political affiliation a protected class, Tobener said that the California state legislature would have to add political affiliations to the Fair Employment and Housing Act as a protected category.\n\nThat move, he said, would certainly be challenged and likely end up in the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I've been doing tenant rights law for 30 years and this will be the third tech boom in San Francisco, and it's a boom and bust city. It always has been since the Gold Rush and what we have right now is this major AI boom with a lot of people wanting to come work here,\" Tobener said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nAccording to the Zumper National Rent Report, \"San Francisco led the nation in annual rent growth, with one-bedroom rent up 13.3% and two-bedrooms surging 16.3%.\"\n\n\"First it was the dot-com boom, then it was a social media boom, and now it's the AI boom, and you're getting this circumstance where landlords have a lot of power,\" Tobener added. \"There are a lot of people clamoring for one unit and, you know, we want to make sure that landlords don't, you know, step across the line. And housing is accessible to everyone regardless of, you know, what they think about the political climate.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Baran for comment but did not immediately receive a response.",

      "text": "As part of his renewed New York City mayoral campaign, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is proposing \"Zohran's law\" to prevent high-income individuals from occupying rent-stabilized apartments. The proposal is a pointed jab at his opponent, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, who occupies a rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria, Queens.\n\"Rent-stabilized apartments when they're vacant should only be rented to people who need affordable housing, not people like Zohran Mamdani,\" Cuomo told reporters in a video posted on social media.\nCuomo, who resigned as governor of New York in 2021 in the face of multiple controversies, told Mamdani over the weekend that it's \"time to move out.\" The former governor's message, posted on X along with an edited video of Mamdani admitting he pays \"$2,300 for my one bedroom in Astoria,\" has amassed more than 33 million views.\n\"You don't need to be renting rent-stabilized units to wealthy people,\" he continued. \"Otherwise, what you are doing is you are abusing the system. I am going to propose not renting out [rent-stabilized] apartments, by law, except to a person who actually needs affordable housing. And, I'm going to call it 'Zohran's law' because it's an abuse of the system.\"\nChief among Mamdani's now-infamous progressive policy proposals is his commitment to freezing rents.\n\"As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent,\" according to Mamdani's campaign website.\nSOCIALIST'S NYC MAYORAL WIN SPARKS FIERCE DEBATE OVER FEASIBILITY OF RADICAL POLICY AGENDA\nMamdani has accused incumbent Mayor Eric Adams of appointing Rent Guidelines Board members to raise rents on stabilized apartments. While landlords and advocates argue the freeze would be illegal, Mamdani can accomplish this goal by appointing members to the board who wouldn't vote to increase the rent.\nFormer Mayor Bill de Blasio's board voted to freeze the rent three times during his tenure.\nCuomo was the favorite to win the Democratic nomination in June. But since Mamdani's political upset and Cuomo's subsequent decision to remain in the race as an independent candidate, the former governor has ramped up his social media strategy, opting for snappy videos and punchy attack lines.\nCuomo had previously called the democratic socialist's plan to freeze rent a \"politically convenient posture,\" and said such a move would hurt landlords who would be \"unable to maintain their buildings.\"\nAs Cuomo's fiery social media posts about Mamdani's rent-controlled apartment made the rounds, de Blasio \u2013 who has yet to endorse a candidate in the race to run the nation's most populous city \u2013 fired back at his governor.\n\"I did a rent freeze and almost 2 million hard-working New Yorkers benefited. @ZohranKMamdani wants to do a rent freeze. You know who doesn\u2019t want to do a rent freeze? @andrewcuomo, and he thinks he can trick us into forgetting that,\" de Blasio trolled on X.\nIn a prior post, Cuomo told his now more than 100,000 followers that because of Mamdani, \"Somewhere last night in New York City, a single mother and her children slept at a homeless shelter,\" and called on him to \"move out immediately and give your affordable housing back to an unhoused family who need it.\"\n\"No matter which way you cut it: Zohran Mamdani is a rich person. You are actually very rich. Yet you and your wife pay $2,300 a month, as you have bragged, for a nice apartment in Astoria. That should be housing for someone who needs it. We are in the middle of a historic affordability crisis. Millions of low income New Yorkers need this apartment and an apartment like it. Yet your apartment remains rented to rich people who don\u2019t need it,\" Cuomo continued.\nDuring a campaign event on Monday, Mamdani responded to Cuomo's freshly proposed law \"that will keep the rich out of New York\u2019s affordable housing.\"\n\"What do we know about this policy proposal beyond the fact that it seeks to evict me from my apartment?\" Mamdani questioned on Monday.\n\"Like so much of Andrew Cuomo's politics, it is characterized by a petty vindictiveness. It leaves far more questions than it has answers. How many New Yorkers would this apply to? How many New Yorkers would be evicted from their apartments? How many New Yorkers would have their lives upended by a former governor who is responding to the fact that he was handily beaten by a tenant of a rent-stabilized apartment?\" Mamdani asked.\n\"I live rent-free in his head,\" Mamdani trolled Cuomo, arguing he had many years to implement such policies as governor but is now only focused on trying to reckon with a \"political defeat.\"\nSoon after Mamdani's criticism, the Cuomo campaign unveiled his proposal to protect rent-stabilized apartments from being occupied by high-income individuals.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Under Cuomo\u2019s proposal, when a rent-stabilized apartment becomes vacant, the incoming individual income would be capped so that the annual rent makes up at least 30 percent of that income. For example, if an apartment rents for $2,500 a month ($30,000 per year), the new tenant\u2019s income could not exceed $100,000,\" according to the plan.\nThe Cuomo campaign also clarified that \"Zohran's law\" would only apply to vacant apartments."

Um, so, no, there is no one else who can run the cult.\"\nHowever, Reid said, she was concerned about White voters and their \"propensity\" to vote for Republicans.\n\"But the problem is, there's the cult and then there is just this propensity among White voters to vote for any Republican and to create an adherence to any Republican because they just hate Democrats, and they don't care \u2026 no one likes Ted Cruz, but they'll vote for him any day of the week because he is not a Democrat,\" Reid added."

His communist policies will crater our economy, increase crime, crowd out Americans with free health care for illegal immigrants, and defund the brave men and women of law enforcement who keep us safe.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe White House added that \"Mamdani's idea of \u2018immigration reform\u2019 is no borders and amnesty for all the violent criminal illegal aliens that Joe Biden released into our country. The American people have repeatedly rejected this Communist agenda and the more Mamdani shares his radical policies, the more the American people will recoil.\"\nFox News' Marly Carroll and Bryan Llenas contributed to this report."

      "text": "The spacious two-bed apartment in Sunnyside had the makings of a steal. At $3,500 per month, the unit \u2014 with a private deck, sweeping city views, and in-unit laundry \u2014 was a reasonable deal in a market where prices are soaring and housing is in short supply.\nThere was just one catch regarding the open house: \u201cOnly MAGA voters and Israel supporters are invited,\u201d the Zillow listing said.\nThe listing went live Aug. 5 and was deactivated Sunday, although it\u2019s unclear if a tenant snatched up the unit. The Standard visited the property Monday and found no obvious signs of an imminent move-in.\nProperty records show the building is owned by Alexander Baran, 48, a quality assurance director who appears to live in another unit there. He declined to comment during our visit.\n\u201cGet the fuck away from here,\u201d Baran said from the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat myself.\u201d\nProperty records show Baran purchased the two-unit property in 2004.\nThe listing drew the ridicule of commenters on Reddit.\n\u201cLeave it to MAGA to just go straight blatant housing discrimination,\u201d one commenter said.\nBut attorneys say no applicable civil rights laws apply.\n\u201cPolitical affiliation, unfortunately, is not a protected characteristic,\u201d said Joseph Tobener, a San Francisco tenant rights attorney.\nThe Unruh Civil Rights Act and Fair Employment Housing Act protect against discrimination on the basis of characteristics like gender, race, and sexual orientation.\n\u201cThere also might be some First Amendment questions here \u2014 in terms of the landlord having protections,\u201d Tobener said.\nElection data shows that in November, roughly 1 in 7 Sunnyside voters cast their ballots for Donald Trump. That\u2019s more red than the Castro and Haight-Ashbury \u2014 which went nearly all in on Kamala Harris \u2014 but solidly blue compared to their neighbors in southern neighborhoods like the Excelsior and Visitacion Valley, where nearly half the voters in some precincts voted for Trump.\nDavid Blosser, director of leasing at RentSFNow, said the San Francisco rental market is at its hottest in years.\n\u201cJune was really the pivotal moment where the market shifted,\u201d Blosser said. \u201cSuddenly we were having back-to-back applicants for units across our portfolio, and really we hadn\u2019t seen that since before the pandemic.\u201d\nBlosser said many tenants are techies coming to the city for the AI boom. In trendy neighborhoods like Nob Hill, Blosser said he has signed tenants within two days of listing rentals."

  "argos_summary": "A San Francisco landlord posted a Zillow listing for a two\u2011bedroom apartment that restricted open\u2011house invitations to \"MAGA voters and Israel supporters,\" sparking accusations of political discrimination.
