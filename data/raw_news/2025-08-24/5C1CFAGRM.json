  "description": "I Tried Keoni CBD Gummies\u2014Here's My Honest Review",
  "content": "Keoni CBD gummies are made with 100% organically grown, domestically-sourced hemp. Although the product label says the gummies are \u201cfull spectrum,\u201d the contents of the product itself seems to be more in line with the industry description of a broad-spectrum CBD product (meaning it goes through an additional process to remove THC). If you\u2019re taking any prescription medications or dietary supplements, be sure to consult with your health care provider before trying Keoni CBD Gummies or any other product containing CBD. We receive compensation from our partners for Featured Partner Offer placements. While this may influence where their products or services appear on our site, it in no way affects our ratings, which are based on thorough research, solid methodologies and expert advice. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable review of their products or services.\n\u2022 Third-party laboratory tested for quality and potency, with certificates of analysis (COAs) easily accessible on the product website\n\u2022 Made with 100% organically-grown hemp, according to the company\n\u2022 Each gummy contains 25 milligrams of full-spectrum CBD, according to the product label (although the website says each gummy contains 20 milligrams of CBD). Keoni CBD offers a variety of CBD products, including gummies, capsules and oils. According to the Keoni website, small-town values are the heart of the business, which strives to provide exceptional customer service and quality products. Strong hemp flavor may not be appealing to some consumers May cause side effects, including dry mouth, drowsiness, gastrointestinal upset or lightheadedness THC-free, according to the product\u2019s COA on the Keoni website Should not be taken with certain medications or supplements (check with a health care provider first)\n\nKeoni CBD Gummies claim to feature full-spectrum CBD, which means they also contain other cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids present in the hemp plant. Because Keoni\u2019s CBD blend is extracted directly from the hemp plant and further isolated and tested to ensure it doesn\u2019t contain THC, it actually seems to be a broad-spectrum blend per industry standards. The human body naturally produces compounds called endocannabinoids, which are very similar to the cannabinoids found in the hemp plant, says Bridget Williams, M.D., a board-certified family physician and the CEO at Green Harvest Health in Pickerington, Ohio. Such compounds help achieve homeostasis in the body, playing a role in a variety of functions, such as sleep, mood, appetite, memory and fertility, says Dr. Williams. Over time, genetics, stress and lifestyle choices can cause us to become deficient in these compounds, leading to what some researchers are calling endocannabinoid deficiency disorder, according to a theory introduced by Ethan Russo M.D., director of research and development at the International Cannabis and Cannabinoids Institute . Symptoms like anxiety and insomnia may indicate an unbalanced endocannabinoid system, says Dr. Williams. \u201cCBD can help restore our endocannabinoids, repair receptors and thus help restore balance via the endocannabinoid system,\u201d says Dr. Williams. In fact, research suggests CBD can improve anxiety and depression, pain and inflammation, and other medical conditions, including arthritis, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy . \u201cI don\u2019t usually use CBD as part of a general wellness routine for happy, healthy people because I assume they have properly functioning endocannabinoid systems,\u201d says David Berger, M.D., a board-certified pediatrician at Wholistic Pediatrics and Family Care in Tampa, Florida. However, he says he utilizes CBD frequently with patients who have mental and behavioral health issues, seizures, movement disorders and hyper-inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.\n\nHow Much Do Keoni CBD Gummies Cost? One bottle of 20 gummies containing a total of 500 milligrams of CBD (25 milligrams per gummy) costs $54.99 ($44.99 with the subscribe-and-save option), and a bottle of 40 gummies containing a total of 1,000 milligrams of CBD (25 milligrams per gummy) costs $64.99 ($54.99 with the subscribe-and-save option). CBD gummies with additional ingredients, including Delta-8 THC or Delta-9 THC and a sleep-promoting CBD blend are also available on the Keoni website. In addition to CBD gummies, Keoni sells a variety of CBD oils, capsules, topical creams, gels, roll-ons and sprays, including bundled items. All products are available at a discount when you choose the subscribe-and-save option for monthly delivery (discounts vary by product).\n\nTo use Keoni\u2019s products, you must be over the age of 18, and the company recommends incorporating CBD into a wellness routine consisting of regular exercise, balanced nutrition and self-care. Results may vary based on your age, overall health and family history, and you should seek the advice of a health care provider before using any supplement, including Keoni CBD gummies, according to the company website. While Keoni claims simplicity is one of its values, its website presents some conflicting information. For example, it discusses the differences between broad-spectrum CBD, full-spectrum CBD, CBD isolate and CBD distillate, but it\u2019s unclear how THC has been removed from its full-spectrum CBD gummies (full-spectrum hemp usually contains trace amounts of THC not exceeding federal regulations of .3% by dry weight). Furthermore, there\u2019s very little information available about the company itself, including where the products are manufactured and who owns and runs the company and its operations.\n\u2022 Original Mixed Berry Gummies are vegan-friendly and free from GMOs\n\u2022 50mg of CBD & 5mg of melatonin per serving\n\u2022 Original Mixed Berry Gummies are vegan-friendly and free from GMOs\n\u2022 50mg of CBD & 5mg of melatonin per serving\n\nWhat Experts Have To Say About Keoni CBD Gummies Gummies are a great option for using CBD due to their ease of use, says Dr. Williams. Gummies usually taste great, travel well, can be cut easily to adjust the dose and are discreet and convenient, she says. \u201cBecause the half-life for CBD gummies is longer than inhalation or [oil] drops, they can better address sleep issues, generalized anxiety issues and chronic pain than [delivery methods] that are eliminated from the body faster,\u201d says Dr. Williams. \u201cBeing a CBD specialist who provides doctor approvals for products, I look for CBD options that have excellent third-party tested COAs\u201d says Dr. Williams. Testing is crucial, along with evenly distributed cannabinoids throughout the gummy (versus being sprayed on top), she says, adding that Keoni appears to be a brand that works hard to create a high-quality CBD product in a competitive and unregulated market. However, Dr. Berger points out that the COAs on Keoni\u2019s website are more than a year old, which could be problematic. \u201cIn my practice, I only recommend products from companies that test each batch for impurities and labeling accuracy and who willingly make these results publicly available,\u201d he says. Because Keoni CBD is a retail company that anyone can access, there\u2019s no oversight when it comes to who\u2019s taking the supplements, with what medications and at what dose, says Erica Steele, a naturopathic doctor at Holistic Family Practice in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cI always pause with [direct-to-consumer brands] simply because they can be harmful for people with various biochemical challenges\u2014for example, those who suffer from depression, are neurodivergent or are currently on psychotropic medications that may interact with CBD,\u201d says Dr. Steele. That said, there aren\u2019t fillers included in the Keoni CBD gummy ingredient list, and they contain a relatively low dose of CBD, says Dr. Steele. \u201cI would not recommend it as a therapeutic product, but more so a preventative one\u2014as long as there\u2019s oversight from a qualified health care provider,\u201d she says.

Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable review of their products or services.\n\u2022 No more than 0.3% hemp-derived THC by weight\n\nI experienced a mild relaxing effect from taking Keoni CBD Gummies. I noticed about 45 minutes after consuming a gummy that I was more mindful than usual as I prepared dinner for the evening. Rather than rushing through the task, I felt more present\u2014most likely a result of reduced anxiety. I also slept soundly that night, with no residual grogginess the next day. The instructions on the container say to take one gummy with a meal. I observed that taking them during the workday made me feel less productive, so I decided to stick with evening use. Overall, I found the gummies to be a good way to unwind and promote an enhanced state of calm at the end of a busy day. Out of 104 Trustpilot reviews, Keoni CBD has an average rating of 2.9 out of five stars. One self-described light sleeper said the gummies were effectively sleep-promoting. Less satisfied customers complained about customer service and issues with shipping and refunds. Keoni CBD is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau and has an F rating, with an average customer rating of one out of five stars. Most complaints were due to issues regarding canceling subscriptions and obtaining product refunds. Forbes Health covers CBD and cannabis products in accordance with FTC guidelines.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nAs the cannabidiol (CBD) market expands and evolves, so does the number of products on the shelf\u2014and it can quickly get overwhelming. The main types of CBD you\u2019ll come across are full spectrum, broad spectrum and CBD isolate. Each one has its own makeup and potential benefits, depending on what you\u2019re looking for. Knowing the key differences between them can help you choose the option that best supports your personal wellness goals.\nFull spectrum, broad spectrum and isolate refer to types of cannabis extracts that indicate how many of the original hemp plant\u2019s compounds are included in the final product. All forms of CBD have pros and cons, and understanding those differences can make a big impact in how well a product works for you.\nForbes Health covers CBD and cannabis products in accordance with FTC guidelines. Learn more about Forbes Health\u2019s practices and policies regarding how we cover CBD and cannabis as a publisher.\nWhat Are the Three Types of CBD?\nCBD, cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG) are three unique cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, each with their own standout traits and potential benefits.\nFull-spectrum CBD contains all extracts of the cannabis or hemp plant, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive cannabinoid chemical, in legal amounts under 0.3%. These compounds work together in what\u2019s known as the \u201centourage effect,\u201d a theory that suggests CBD may be more effective when all cannabis compounds are combined rather than isolated.\nBroad-spectrum CBD contains all the same cannabinoids, terpenes (what makes certain cannabis plants smell or taste different from others) and compounds as full-spectrum, but the THC is almost completely extracted.\nIsolate CBD is a purified form of cannabidiol, typically 99% or more. It contains no other compounds from the hemp plant, and is therefore unlikely to appear on a drug test for THC.\nWhat Form of CBD Is Most Effective?\nCurrent research suggests that full spectrum CBD may be the most effective form for many users due to what some people call the \u201centourage effect.\u201d The combined effects of CBD and THC can offer users a higher level of relief for their symptoms, especially pain.\nResearch also indicates that full-spectrum products may produce increased effectiveness of CBD due to greater bioavailability and systemic exposure. Bioavailability is the percentage of CBD that actually enters your bloodstream and becomes active in your body, and varies between individuals.\nHowever, effectiveness ultimately depends on individual factors, including sensitivity to THC, desired therapeutic outcomes and personal tolerance levels. Broad spectrum CBD offers benefits from the entourage effect just as full spectrum CBD does, while avoiding THC-related or drug testing concerns.\nRetailers offer CBD in a variety of forms, including:\n- CBD oils and tinctures. These can take action faster than edibles, since users typically place the oil or tincture under the tongue before swallowing. This allows the CBD to be absorbed through the sublingual blood vessels, which results in a much quicker onset of effects since digestion doesn\u2019t delay absorption.\n- Capsules, pills and edibles like CBD gummies. Edibles have long-lasting effects and come in pre-measured doses. Onset of effects can be slightly delayed; diet and digestive factors can influence absorption.\n- Topical creams and balms. These are applied directly to the skin, typically to target localized discomfort, inflammation or muscle soreness. They work on a localized level by interacting with cannabinoid receptors in the skin.\n- Inhalation methods, like vaping or smoking. While this method is fast-acting and typically used to treat acute symptoms, it\u2019s not recommended for anyone with lung conditions or sensitivities.\n- CBD-infused beverages. These are easy to incorporate into your daily routine or social life, however dosing can be inconsistent depending on the brand or formulation.\nWhat Is the Difference Between CBD, CBN and CBG?\nCBD, CBN and CBG are three unique cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. Here\u2019s how they differ:\n- CBD (cannabidiol) is perhaps the most well-known and studied. It\u2019s commonly used to ease anxiety, promote relaxation, support sleep and reduce discomfort.\n- CBN (cannabinol) forms when THC is exposed to heat and light over time and is not produced directly by the plant. Although CBN shows promise in offering users sleep benefits, additional high-quality research is needed.\n- CBG (cannabigerol) is often called the \u201cmother cannabinoid\u201d because it\u2019s the compound from which many other cannabinoids are formed, including CBD and THC. CBG is best known for easing inflammation, making it a go-to for daytime use.\nHow To Choose a CBD Product\nWhen choosing a CBD product, potential users need to consider several critical factors to ensure they select a safe, effective and appropriate option.\nSafety and quality\nUsers should look for CBD companies that are Certified Organic on the USDA website and ensure the product has a certificate of analysis (COA) from an independent, certified laboratory. These lab reports verify potency, confirm the absence of harmful contaminants like pesticides and heavy metals, and validate that THC levels comply with legal limits.\nCheck the Label\nWhen checking a CBD product label, start by identifying what type of CBD is in the product: full spectrum, broad spectrum or isolate. Next, review the ingredient list for transparency and quality.\nAll required label statements must be placed on the front label panel or on the information panel . The FDA has specific label requirements for CBD products. Contents of labels must include the following information[1]:\n- Statement of the supplement\u2019s identity\n- Quantity of contents in the container\n- Nutrition labeling\n- Ingredient list\n- Manufacturer\u2019s name and place of business\nCheck Brand Reviews\nChecking brand reviews is an important step when choosing a CBD product because it gives you real-world insight into how the product performs and how the company treats its customers. Reviews from confirmed users can reveal whether the product delivers on its promises by meeting consumer needs. Consumers can find trustworthy brand reviews at third-party review websites, retailer websites, e-commerce platforms, industry-specific directories, consumer advocacy outlets and social media or online forums.\nIn addition, reviews can shed light on the company\u2019s transparency and customer service. With so many CBD brands on the market, looking at verified customer experiences can help you avoid low-quality products and choose one that\u2019s both trustworthy and effective.\nCertificate of Analysis\nA Certificate of Analysis, or COA, is a lab report provided by a third-party testing facility that details exactly what\u2019s in a CBD product\u2014and reliable companies will include these on their websites. These lab reports break down the cannabinoid content, confirming how much CBD, THC and other compounds are present, so you can be sure the product contains what the label claims.\nA COA also tests for contaminants like pesticides, heavy metals, mold and residual solvents, which could be harmful if consumed. Since the CBD industry is still largely unregulated, it\u2019s important to find ways to verify a product\u2019s safety and potency."

Try our Full Spectrum Mixed Berry CBD Gummies, available in 1500mg, 3000mg, and 6000mg strengths. You\u2019ll also enjoy our CBD Gummies for Sleep with Melatonin and CBD Gummies for Focus & Energy.\nPharmD\nMedically Reviewed\nPharmD\nCBD is a great natural wellness supplement, due to the way it interacts with the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system, which helps the body maintain homeostasis (balance). Because it\u2019s sort of a Swiss Army knife when it comes to overall wellness, CBD is an ideal compound to match with other vitamins and nutrients to make a more robust wellness product. CBDfx\u2019s Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies are a great CBD-only product to use for daily wellness. Made with organically grown CBD, these gummies also feature delicious natural flavors and are a perfect addition to any morning health regime.\nDirections for Best Results\nThe suggested serving size for our 1500mg Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies is two gummies (50mg). For our 3000mg Mixed Berry Broad Spectrum CBD Gummies, the recommended serving size is two gummies (100mg). For our high-potency 6000mg gummies, the recommended serving size is also two gummies.\nIf you\u2019re new to CBD, we suggest that you try half a gummy serving (25mg) first to see how it affects you. If your CBD gummy works, great! You\u2019ve found your effective CBD serving size. If not, then wait until the next day to try a higher CBD dosage. Remember that when you take CBD gummies and other edibles, it can take 30 minutes to two hours for you to feel the effects, depending on personal bioavailability factors, including height, weight, body mass, CBD tolerance, and other factors.\nThe Benefits of Original Mixed Berry Broad Spectrum CBD Gummies\nCBD and gummies are a match made in Heaven. CBD, of course, is the incredibly popular health supplement that engages the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system and produces powerful calming wellness benefits for the mind and body.**\nThere are many reasons that many CBD users prefer to enjoy their cannabidiol supplements in gummy form. Gummies are easily portable and you can discreetly take them whenever and wherever you like. CBD gummies also allow you to know exactly how much CBD you\u2019re taking in every serving. This is especially important for those new to CBD, who are learning how to find their own personal Goldilocks serving: the amount of CBD that\u2019s just right for them. Because we all have different bioavailability (the rate and amount of CBD that we absorb), CBD can affect us all differently. Having a reliable serving size takes all the guesswork out of CBD dosage. Again, keep in mind that our 1500mg bottle of CBD gummies contains gummies that are 25mg CBD each. Our 3000mg gummies contain 50mg CBD per gummy. And the big boi 6000mg gummies contain 100mg per gummy.\nWith 1500, 3000, and 6000 mg bottles available, our broad spectrum CBD gummies come in strengths for both beginners and veteran CBD users.\nOriginal Mixed Berry CBD Gummies vs Full Spectrum Mixed Berry CBD Gummies\nOur Full Spectrum Mixed Berry CBD Gummies may taste the same, but they\u2019re made with full spectrum CBD oil, with an added 3mg per serving of delta-9 THC. Our Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies are made with broad spectrum CBD, which means that all detectable levels of THC have been filtered out. Don\u2019t confuse the two; these are not the same gummies.\nWhy Use Broad Spectrum CBD in CBD Gummies?\nThere are three types of CBD oil used in the various CBD products you\u2019ll find online and in stores. When the CBD is initially extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the hemp plant, that unfiltered CBD oil is called full spectrum CBD. Full spectrum oil contains all of the cannabinoids (including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and trace amounts of THC), terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids of the hemp plant.\nAlthough hemp, by law, must contain less than 0.3% THC content (which is likely not enough to get you high), many people still prefer to have those trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol removed. For one thing, this takes all the worry out of potentially having a false-positive result on a drug test. But also, many folks just don\u2019t want THC in their system.\nAnd so, a filtration process takes place that removes all detectable THC from the CBD oil. While this filtration process does remove a few of the other hemp compounds in the process, the resulting oil is still a robust and potent CBD oil, full of cannabinoids and other compounds. This CBD oil is called broad spectrum CBD. (Please note that even the tiniest traces of THC can build up over time in your system, potentially even with broad spectrum usage).\nThe benefit of these two kinds of CBD is that they allow you to experience the Entourage Effect. This is the phenomenon in which CBD and other hemp compounds don\u2019t merely work in parallel with one another when consumed together; but instead, the various cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually enhance each other\u2019s effects, making them work harder for you!\nThere is a third type of CBD, as well, which is called CBD isolate. The isolate form of CBD has all other hemp matter removed, except for the CBD, and is 99% pure CBD. This flavorless and scent-free version of CBD does work well with some bath products and CBD vape juices. But it does not provide the Entourage Effect.\nWe prefer broad spectrum CBD for our CBD gummies because it gives you the benefit of the Entourage Effect and a wide variety of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids to enhance your experience \u2014 with detectable levels of THC filtered out.\nOther Natural Ingredients in Our Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies\nOur Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies contain no corn syrup, artificial colors or sweeteners, or animal-based ingredients. These gummies are made with organic tapioca syrup and cane sugar (only 1 gram), pectin, tri sodium citrate, citric acid, tomato lycopene (for color), and natural flavoring. With our CBD gummies, you can rest assured that you\u2019re enjoying an all-natural, vegan CBD experience!\nWhy Are CBDfx Gummies the Best CBD Gummies?\nAt CBDfx, we insist on purity and potency in all of our CBD products. Every product we sell is made with organic hemp, with the CBD oil extracted by means of clean CO2. The result is a CBD product that is free of pesticides, heavy metals, GMOs, solvent residues, and other potentially harmful chemicals.

While <a href=\"https://cbdfx.com/is-cbd-legal-in-my-state-2/\"state-by-state CBD regulations can differ, hemp products with less than 0.3% THC content were made legal at the national level by the 2018 US Farm Bill.\nOur CBD gummies deliver 50 mg of broad spectrum CBD, which engages your body\u2019s endocannabinoid system.

For our 3000mg gummies, it\u2019s two gummies (100mg CBD), as with our 6000mg gummies (200mg CBD). However, for first-time CBD users, we recommend that you try a half serving of our 1500mg gummies to see how CBD affects you, before moving up to a full serving size.\nSide effects from taking CBD are rare, but they can include reduced appetite, dry mouth, diarrhea, drowsiness, and fatigue.

      "text": "There is no recommended CBD dosage for retail CBD products, including gummies. The FDA has only approved one prescription drug containing CBD, Epidiolex, which is used to treat rare forms of epilepsy.\nMost CBD gummies contain between 10 milligrams of CBD per serving and 50 milligrams of CBD per serving (or higher), and manufacturer recommendations vary greatly from product to product.\nStarting \u201cslow and low\u201d is important when it comes to CBD dosing, says Dr. Williams. \u201cFor those new to CBD, it\u2019s wise to start with a low dose to gauge how your body reacts,\u201d she adds. For retail CBD gummies, Dr. Williams considers a low dose of CBD to be 5 to 10 milligrams per serving, a moderate dose to be 10 to 25 milligrams of CBD per serving and a high dose to be 25 milligrams to 50 milligrams of CBD per serving.\nAs edibles, CBD gummies must go through the body\u2019s digestive system and the liver in a process called first-pass metabolism before any CBD is absorbed into the body, which research suggests can lead to low bioavailability and delayed onset of effects. In fact, a 2023 article in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences suggests that just 9% to 13% of CBD taken orally, such as CBD gummies, is absorbed by the body.\n\u201cBecause some CBD is lost during digestion, those [individuals] with moderate to severe symptoms may need to take a higher dose than initially anticipated,\u201d says Dr. Williams. \u201cIf you\u2019re using gummies for conditions like anxiety or chronic pain relief, you might require a dose of 30 milligrams to 50 milligrams to compensate for the reduced absorption rate.\u201d\nTo assist with increased bioavailability, Dr. McNally recommends looking for a product that contains a water-soluble (or emulsion) form of CBD rather than a CBD oil. These details can be found on product packaging.\nAlways speak to a clinician familiar with CBD before adding CBD gummies to your health regimen, as the appropriate dose is highly individualized and based on specific needs.\nHow Do CBD Gummies Work?\nResearch into how CBD gummies and CBD in general work in the body is ongoing. The only CBD product that\u2019s undergone rigorous clinical testing is the FDA-approved drug, Epidiolex.\nHowever, studies suggest that certain CBD benefits are due to the cannabinoid\u2019s interaction with the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS may contribute to certain functions of the body\u2019s central and peripheral nervous systems, including mood, behavior, seizure activity, male and female reproductive activity and digestion, among others.\nThe ECS features CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Experts believe CBD and other cannabinoids and terpenes interact with these receptors to produce certain effects, such as reducing inflammation in the body, though additional research is necessary.\nMany experts and retailers suggest full-spectrum and broad-spectrum CBD, which contain several naturally occurring cannabinoids and terpenes, may have an enhanced effect within the body through the synergistic entourage effect (when multiple cannabinoids interact with the ECS at once). However, a recent review in Pharmaceuticals concludes little conclusive research exists to support proof of the entourage effect, and further studies are necessary."

Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, while CBD has potential calming and relaxation effects. Combining the sleep-inducing properties of CBD and melatonin may provide an effective option for those struggling with sleep issues. Our 1500mg CBD gummies contain 25mg of CBD per gummy and the serving size is two gummies. Our 3000mg CBD gummies contain 50mg of CBD per gummy, with a 100mg of CBD in every two-gummy serving. And our 6000mg gummies contain 100mg per gummy, with 200mg CBD per two-gummy serving.\nLooking for something stronger? Enjoy the deep relaxation of delta-9 THC + melatonin in our blissful Lemon Dream THC Gummies! Need extra energy to get through the day? Try our CBD Gummies for Focus & Energy!\nDermatologist\nMedically Reviewed\nDermatologist\nI took one of these yummy gummies right before going to bed after a long day at work, in which my sleep cycle was a bit off. I had taken it right after dinner and right before bedtime, the time period that I typically recommend using the supplement. Right away, I started to see its ingredients working by getting me in the mood for bed and a good night\u2019s rest. The following morning I woke up refreshed and not groggy at all, unlike some of the typical melatonin supplements I have taken in the past. I highly recommend it to anyone who has trouble falling asleep and wants a more natural supplement than the many recommended sleep products that are out there. It is worth giving it a shot to better be able to address the much-needed beauty rest we all need to carry out a productive day.\nThe melatonin gummies are locally made and also pleasant to digest. They contain melatonin, a natural ingredient in our pineal gland that helps regulate sleep and may assist with restlessness. Each gummy contains about 5 mg, which is just the adequate dose to make a difference. The blend features a unique formula of magnesium, which helps to relax, plus passion flower, chamomile, and lemon balm, which help to promote calmness and a relaxing state.\nThese gummies help me relax and calm down from a busy and stressful lifestyle.\nDirections for Best Results\nThe suggested serving size for each of the 1500mg, 3000mg, and 6000mg strengths is two gummies, with the 3000mg version delivering double the CBD in every serving and the 6000mg delivering four times the CBD per serving.\nWe suggest, if you\u2019re new to CBD, that you try half a 1500 strength gummy serving the first time around to see how it affects you. If your CBD gummy works, great! You have found your effective CBD serving size. If not, then wait until the next night to try a higher CBD dosage. Remember that when you take CBD edibles, it can take 30 minutes to two hours for you to feel the effects, depending on personal bioavailability factors, including height, weight, CBD tolerance, and other factors.\nThe Benefits of CBD Gummies for Sleep\nOur CBD Gummies With Melatonin for Sleep are an effective natural sleep aid, formulated to give you a full night\u2019s rest. With organic broad spectrum CBD, melatonin and all-natural ingredients, these delicious hemp gummies are a safe, effective and natural alternative to traditional sleeping pills, which can potentially become habitual and can leave you with an unpleasant hangover feeling in the morning. With CBD Sleep Gummies, you\u2019ll awaken refreshed, renewed, and ready to take on your day!\nOur CBD Gummies for Sleep begin with organic broad spectrum CBD. CBD (or cannabidiol) has many healthful properties due to its interaction with the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system.** The endocannabinoid system helps to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in various systems and organs throughout the body, including the nervous system and brain. This helps the body to regulate such crucial functions as mood, memory, stress, immune, inflammation, appetite, pain, motor control and, yes, the body\u2019s ability to regulate sleep cycles.\nUsing Melatonin With CBD\nMelatonin is a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland in the brain and released into the bloodstream to help regulate the sleep-wake cycle. People have taken over-the-counter melatonin supplements for decades to complement the body\u2019s sometimes inadequate production of this restful hormone. Melatonin is an ideal supplement to combine with CBD, since both ingredients simply help the body do what it\u2019s already doing \u2014 only more efficiently. Make sure not to drive or operate heavy machinery when taking a melatonin product, as melatonin may cause drowsiness.\nWhat Are Terpenes?\nTerpenes are phytocompounds that give plants their scent, and do everything from encouraging pollination to warning away pests. For humans, these compounds have often been found to have beneficial wellness effects. In fact, terpenes form the basis of many essential oils, and are used in holistic treatments, such as aromatherapy. Some terpenes, such as those found in lavender and yes, cannabis, have been found to relax the mind and body.\nTerpenes can also contribute to the Entourage Effect, which is a term used to describe the phenomenon by which CBD and other hemp compounds bolster each other\u2019s effects when consumed together. This means the broad spectrum CBD in these vegan CBD gummies makes the sleep terpenes work harder for you and those very same terpenes make your calming CBD more effective, too.\nOther Restful Ingredients\nOur CBD Gummies with Melatonin for Sleep contain several restful ingredients to regulate sleep cycles and maximize your sleep experience. Magnesium has been shown to help the mind and body unwind and relax. Likewise, the botanical extracts used in these gummies \u2014 from passion flower, lemon balm, and chamomile \u2014 also give a calming effect that helps to prepare the body for rest.\nWith broad spectrum CBD, restful melatonin and magnesium, plus a potent blend of calming botanicals and sleep terpenes, our CBD Gummies for Sleep are a tasty way to send you off to Dreamland!\nWhy Are CBDfx Hemp Gummies the Best?\nAt CBDfx, we insist on purity and potency in every product we sell, including every CBD gummy.

      "text": "CBD capsules are a pill-like product you consume orally. The capsules consist of a casing, often made with gelatin (or a vegan or vegetarian substitute), and filling containing a specific amount of CBD.\nCBD capsules are one of the many ways people can consume CBD, including oil tinctures, gummies and other edibles, and smoke or vapor inhalation.\nWhat Are CBD Capsules Used for?\nCBD capsules are popular for a few main reasons, according to Nick Jackowetz and Cam MacNeil, the chief scientific officer and chief commercial officer of Cirona Labs, which manufactures and processes cannabinoid ingredients.\n\u201cCapsules are flavorless, which can be a pleasant experience for a novice CBD user,\u201d says Jackowetz. \u201cThey also contain a precise dose that doesn\u2019t require any expertise to use and takes the guesswork out for the consumer.\u201d\nMany people are already used to taking pills, and most capsules are small, making them easy to add to your routine even when on the go.\nHow Do CBD Capsules Compare to CBD Oils?\nDosage\nCBD capsules are handy if you want to take a specific dose each time. However, you are limited to the dosage of the product. For example, if one capsule contains 20 milligrams of CBD, you can\u2019t adjust your dosage by 5 milligrams. You can only go up or down by 20 milligrams.\nCBD oil tinctures, which come in bottles with a dropper, make it easier to find a middle-of-the-road dose. However, you also face greater variability in how much CBD you measure and ultimately consume with the dropper.\nTime to Take Effect\nCBD capsules take a bit longer to take effect than CBD oil tinctures. \u201cWith capsules, the CBD must travel through the stomach into the liver and gut to be metabolized,\u201d says Laura Fuentes, a licensed compounding pharmacist and chief officer of science and innovation at Green Roads, a CBD company. Additional research into CBD\u2019s absorption rate and bioavailability is necessary.\nHow Do CBD Capsules Compare to CBD Gummies?\nCBD capsules and CBD gummies both go through first-pass digestion before taking effect, and more research is required regarding how long effects might be delayed or blunted by this process. However, while gummies often contain additional flavors and ingredients, capsules usually have a shorter ingredient list, containing only CBD and the vegan, vegetarian or regular gelatin casing of the capsule.\nAn individual\u2019s personal preferences determine whether the taste and aftertaste of a CBD gummy is palatable. For those who prefer flavorless options, capsules may be a more appealing choice. CBD capsules and gummies are often available in similar potencies and types.\nDiscover natural balance with Cornbread Full Spectrum Capsules\nCrafted with premium hemp extract for maximum effectiveness.

      "text": "Do CBD gummies relieve pain?\nCBD has anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain relieving) properties, which may make it an effective treatment for certain types of pain. Some studies have shown CBD has promise in relieving pain, but further studies on humans are needed.\nWhich form of CBD is best for pain?\nThere isn\u2019t a \u201cbest\u201d form of CBD for pain, as it varies depending on individual preferences and needs. Some people may find relief with CBD creams while others may prefer to take CBD oils or gummies orally.\nAre CBD gummies good for pain?\nMore research is needed to understand how CBD interacts in the body to address pain, and it isn\u2019t yet approved by the FDA for pain management specifically. However, some scientific evidence suggests CBD may be beneficial for managing certain types of pain. Consult a health care provider before adding it to your regimen, and prioritize CBD brands that participate in clinical research on CBD use for pain.\nHow much CBD is good for pain relief?\nCBD products range significantly in potency, and responses to the cannabinoid vary per person. Most CBD product manufacturers recommend starting with a low dose and gradually increasing as needed. It\u2019s important to follow the manufacturer instructions on product labels to ensure safe and effective use.\nWhat is the best time of day to take CBD gummies for pain?\nThere are currently no medical recommendations about the best timing for taking CBD gummies. It\u2019s best to follow any instructions on the container of your CBD gummies for advice about timing of doses and whether they should be taken with food or water."

These berry-flavored, vegan gummies also provide you with a sense of blissful calm, plus all the wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD\u2014available in 1500mg, 3000mg, and ultra-strong 6000mg.**\nPrefer broad spectrum CBD? Try our Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies!\nThe Benefits of Full Spectrum CBD Gummies \u2013 Mixed Berry\nSo, what does the \u201cfull spectrum\u201d part of Mixed Berry Full Spectrum CBD Gummies mean? Full spectrum CBD is the oil that\u2019s initially extracted from the hemp plant. This rich hemp oil contains all of the plant\u2019s cannabinoids (including CBD, CBG, CBC, CBN), terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids.\nThe main wellness benefit of using full spectrum products, like these CBD gummies, is that cannabinoids and other hemp compounds actually function much better when they are consumed together. So, in essence, your CBD actually works harder for you in a product like our full spectrum gummies than it does in broad spectrum or CBD isolate products. This phenomenon is called the Entourage Effect.\nFull Spectrum Mixed Berry CBD Gummies vs. Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies\nOur Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies may taste the same, but they\u2019re made with broad spectrum CBD oil. Our Full Spectrum Mixed Berry CBD Gummies, as the name suggests, are made with full spectrum oil. So, when we talk about full spectrum CBD gummies vs broad spectrum CBD gummies, remember that these are two different gummy products with differing levels of CBD and THC.\nHow Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a Full Spectrum CBD Gummy?\nCBD edibles, such as gummies, can take a little while to kick in. This is because the cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through your digestive system. In general, it can take between 30 minutes and two hours for the effects of CBD gummies to fully kick in.\nHow Long Do the Effects of CBD Gummies Last?\nWhile you have to wait a little longer to feel the effects of CBD gummies as opposed to, say, a CBD tincture oil or CBD vape product, the effects of your edible last much longer than those other types of products. Generally speaking, the effects of a CBD edible can last for six to eight hours.\nFor both your waiting time and the duration of the effects of your CBD gummy product, we can really only speak in general terms. CBD products hit everyone differently, which makes sense given that we all have different body shapes and sizes, as well as tolerances and metabolisms. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always best to start with a low dose and see how the product affects you. The recommended serving size of these CBD gummies is two gummies.\nWhat Are the Best Full Spectrum CBD Gummies?\nAll CBDfx CBD products are made with organic CBD hemp oil. This means that all of our products are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. The CBD oil used in our products is also extracted with clean carbon dioxide, which doesn\u2019t leave behind solvent residues as is the case with some cheaper extraction methods.\nYou can verify the purity and potency of our Mixed Berry CBD Gummies, as well as all or our other products, by checking the Certificate of Analysis (COA). This is a lab report created by an independent, third-party laboratory. These lab reports allow you to verify the purity and potency of every one of our products. When you shop with CBDfx, you\u2019re getting the very best CBD products.\nEnjoy two gummies per serving, but if this is your first time taking a full spectrum product, we advise you to start with a low dose (one gummy, or even one half of a gummy). Make sure to wait at least one hour to feel the effects before consuming more. Do not take if driving, operating heavy machinery, or if alertness is needed.\nFull spectrum hemp oil is the extract that is initially derived from the hemp plant\u2019s leaves, stalks, and buds. This robust oil contains all the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids of the hemp plant\u2014including CBD and less than 0.3% THC. Broad spectrum CBD is made when all detectable traces of THC are filtered out. This filtering process also results in the removal of some of the other hemp compounds, but it\u2019s still a fairly robust oil. Both full and broad spectrum CBD can produce the Entourage Effect.\nOur Mixed Berry Full Spectrum CBD Gummies are legal hemp products, in compliance with the 2018 US Farm Bill. Please note that state and local laws may vary, so consult local law enforcement before purchasing.\nFor some users, CBD can cause temporary side effects, including dry mouth, loss of appetite, fatigue, and diarrhea. This is true of full spectrum CBD and other types of CBD. Side effects generally occur because the user has consumed much more than the recommended serving size. As noted elsewhere, the recommended serving size of these CBD gummies is two gummies.\nThese vegan gummies were formulated to help you enjoy the blissfully calming effects of full spectrum CBD. Many people use these gummies to ease stress and improve their mood.** These gummies are not intended to get you high, so please stick with the recommended serving size.

      "text": "Experts advise newcomers to start with a low dose of CBD oil, such as 25 milligrams a day, and gradually increase their dose to a level that provides the desired effects. It\u2019s best to navigate this process under the guidance of a qualified health care provider, as reactions to CBD can vary per person.\nFor CBD oil to take effect, it must first be digested in a process called first-pass digestion. Preliminary research suggests consuming CBD oil with high-fat foods may increase CBD\u2019s bioavailability, but further human trials are needed. CBD tinctures are taken under the tongue and are absorbed by the mucous membranes, which may mean they take effect more quickly, though more scientific evidence is necessary to support this theory.\nHow to Read CBD Labels\nCBD products are not currently regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, so it\u2019s difficult to determine a product\u2019s safety and efficacy. However, knowing how to read a label can help ensure consumers understand the ingredients and potential benefits or risks of using a certain CBD product.\nStatement of identity: This information indicates a product\u2019s intended use. When shopping for CBD products, check the label to ensure you\u2019re buying the specific form you\u2019re looking for, such as cream, edible or tincture.\nComposition: The content of a CBD product should indicate amounts of CBD per serving and CBD type (broad spectrum, full spectrum or isolate).\nHealth-related claims: These claims may also indicate to a consumer the intended use of a CBD product and its possible effects. Consider whether a CBD product claims to offer specific benefits, such as promoting sleep, pain relief or reducing anxiety.\nNutritional content: This information may be useful for individuals with health or dietary concerns, as some CBD labels may display certain nutritional claims. For example, some product labels may indicate that a product is low-calorie or gluten-free. This information should also include additional ingredients such as carrier oils and natural or artificial flavorings.\nThird-party testing: All CBD products should be third-party laboratory tested to verify that the product contains no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. If a product has been third-party tested, it should come with a certificate of analysis (COA) that confirms the amount of CBD the product contains and discloses whether the product contains additional cannabinoids, such as THC, as well as levels of contaminants like heavy metals, pesticides or biological impurities.\nChoosing the Best CBD Oil Strength\nThere\u2019s no standard dose or potency when it comes to taking CBD oil. Effects vary from person to person and depend on the type of CBD used, as well as other factors, such as height, weight and metabolic function. Furthermore, the effective dose of CBD oil may change based on the intended use\u2014for example, whether it\u2019s being used to support sleep, improve pain levels or reduce anxiety. More research is needed to determine standard effective doses and potencies of CBD oil.\n\u201cCBD oil is used\u2014without much supportive evidence\u2014for the self-medication of various conditions, including pain and anxiety,\u201d says Dr. Piomelli. \u201cIf someone decides to try it, I would recommend to start with a low daily dose (50 milligrams maximum) and make sure to monitor themselves for side effects like somnolence (drowsiness), fatigue and diarrhea. I wouldn\u2019t exceed a daily dose of 250 milligrams, nor would I take it for more than two to three weeks.\u201d\nHow Much CBD Oil Should I Take?\nThe amount of CBD oil an individual should take varies based on the potency of the oil, the type of CBD it uses and desired effects. What\u2019s more, CBD oil effects and absorption rates depend on additional factors, such as a person\u2019s body weight, height and individual metabolism.\nExperts generally recommend starting with a low dose and potency and building from there to find the ideal CBD oil dose for you.\nHow Long Does CBD Oil Take to Work?\nSome research suggests holding CBD oil underneath the tongue may lead to absorption through the bloodstream, meaning the effects may be felt sooner than other delivery methods, but additional studies are needed to support these claims.\nMeanwhile, CBD oil that is swallowed may take as long as 30 minutes to four hours to take effect, according to Dr. Piomelli. Additionally, research indicates that CBD bioavailability increases when consumed with a high-fat or high-calorie meal rather than consuming CBD alone or on an empty stomach.\n\u201cA full stomach speeds up absorption, but it could still take hours for CBD to be fully absorbed,\u201d adds Dr. Piomelli."

      "text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn\u2019t approve or test retail CBD products for quality or potency, meaning consumers are responsible for selecting the best product to meet their needs. Further complicating matters, some retail CBD products have been found to be mislabeled regarding potency, as well as purity. A 2017 study in JAMA Network indicates that, among 84 independently tested retail CBD products, 26% contained less CBD than the label claimed, and 43% contained more CBD compared to the label. Knowing the signs of a high-quality CBD product for anxiety and stress is therefore extremely important prior to purchase or consumption.\nFactors that may indicate a product is high quality include:\n- USDA-certified organic seal\n- Label indicates the product is non-GMO and contains all-natural ingredients\n- Certificate of analysis (COA) is easily accessible, demonstrating potency and safety\n- Company doesn\u2019t make unsupported health claims\n- Manufacturer provides specific dosage information\n- Whether the CBD is processed to be water soluble\nA health care professional familiar with using CBD for anxiety may be able to help you choose the highest quality product for your needs.\nTypes of CBD for Anxiety\nRetail CBD products are available in three forms: CBD isolate, broad-spectrum CBD and full-spectrum CBD, which differ based on extraction and processing methods. While CBD isolate contains exclusively CBD, broad-spectrum and full-spectrum CBD contain additional cannabinoids and active plant constituents, such as terpenes. Meanwhile, broad-spectrum CBD is processed to contain non-detectable levels of THC while full-spectrum CBD contains all naturally occurring cannabinoids, including up to 0.3% THC by dry weight.\nPersonal preference comes into play regarding the type of CBD product an individual prefers, from beverage to edible gummy to oil and more.\nRecommended CBD Dosage for Anxiety\nThere\u2019s no established CBD dosage for anxiety management. Manufacturers typically include a recommended dose on the product packaging and/or website, and CBD consumers should read these instructions carefully.\nCBD may also be absorbed more effectively when taken with food, according to Dr. McNally, which may be important when considering one\u2019s optimal dosage. Experts generally recommend starting at a low dosage and increasing that amount slowly over time to avoid unwanted side effects.\nCBD Risks and Side Effects\nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), orally administered CBD products like CBD gummies and CBD oils may cause uncomfortable or harmful side effects, including:\n- Diarrhea\n- Nausea\n- Decreased mental alertness/sedation\n- Fatigue\n- Mood changes, such as irritability\n- Liver injury\n- Male reproductive harm\n- Drug interactions\nAlways speak to a health care provider familiar with your medical history and any medications you\u2019re taking before adding a retail CBD product to your wellness regimen to limit the potential for negative side effects."

      "text": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the latest ingredients to take the health world by storm. Derived from both hemp and cannabis plants, CBD, as well as other cannabinoids, spark curiosity in some and skepticism in others. Meanwhile, a lack of federal regulations surrounding the substance in the U.S. makes it particularly challenging to parse fact from fiction when it comes to consumer health and safety.\nWe at Forbes Health take our role of providing you with accurate, research-supported, and expert-backed information very seriously\u2014especially when it comes to murky topics like CBD and other hemp and cannabis cannabinoids.\nThe Legal Landscape of CBD\nHemp is defined as a cannabis plant that contains no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. Meanwhile, marijuana is a cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. Any cannabis plant containing more than 0.3% THC is considered non-hemp cannabis\u2014or marijuana\u2014under federal law.\nThe Farm Bill Act, among other changes, removed hemp\u2019s classification as marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act, effectively making hemp-derived products legal. However, the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly preserved the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s authority over hemp products. Therefore, hemp products must meet any applicable FDA requirements and standards just like any other FDA-regulated product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).\nAt a minimum, states have approved the use of FDA-approved products that contain less than 0.3% THC. Some states have a cap of 0.05% THC while others have legalized marijuana entirely. Some states expressly permit the use of CBD gummies that fall within these guidelines. This variance puts local regulations in misalignment with federal guidelines. As of right now, CBD is neither approved for inclusion in food nor as a dietary supplement.\nOur Stance on CBD\nIt is our editorial policy to not make unsubstantiated or unscientific claims in our content or recommend products derived from marijuana. Similar to our other areas of health coverage, all health claims must be attributable to a scientific study in order to align with requirements of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and marijuana-derived products remain illegal in most states and have not been removed from the federal list of controlled substances.\nGenerally speaking, the use of hemp-derived CBD is legal under the Farm Bill Act. In our coverage of such products:\n- We will not recommend products that derive CBD from non-hemp sources (sources containing more than 0.3% THC by dry weight).\n- We will not make unsubstantiated claims that cannot be scientifically validated.\n- We will not recommend CBD products as dietary supplements or as part of a healthy diet or wellness regimen.\nIt is our goal and privilege to serve as your trusted source for safe and accurate CBD information. When reading any of our CBD content, know that it was carefully written, edited and fact-checked prior to publication. We physically review and third-party lab-test CBD products where appropriate to confirm their potency, quality and safety. What\u2019s more, we are paying constant attention to the legal landscape of CBD and cannabis to ensure our content accurately reflects any changes that should occur."

      "text": "Research suggests the cannabinoids in topical CBD creams may be absorbed more efficiently by the body through the skin, rather than passing through digestion, as is the case with orally ingested CBD products.\nAlthough research in the U.S. is ongoing, preliminary studies show that topical CBD cream may be beneficial when it comes to treating chronic pain conditions, such as arthritis. However, additional well-designed human clinical trials are needed, as much of the existing research is based on animal studies or anecdotal results.\nOne small, placebo-controlled 2020 study in Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology examined the use of topical CBD in 29 participants with peripheral neuropathy, a chronic pain condition caused by nerve damage. The results showed that the 15 participants using topical CBD oil experienced significantly less pain compared to the 14 participants using the placebo after four weeks.\nAnother 2018 study with over 300 participants with knee pain from osteoarthritis found a transdermal synthetic CBD gel significantly improved patients\u2019 worst pain score and physical function averages. These patients were treated with 350 milligrams of CBD gel per day for 12 weeks.\nAdditionally, some research suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD cream may help to improve certain skin conditions such as acne and eczema.\nExperience The Refreshing Relief of CBD Lotion And Menthol\nBlends the calming benefits of CBD with the invigorating sensation of menthol. Elevate your wellness routine with this trending fusion of natural remedies. Embrace the cooling comfort. Discover CBD Lotion + Menthol and feel revitalized today!\"\nCBD Creams and Topicals Side Effects\nCBD itself is safe and well tolerated, and it has no risks of abuse or dependence, according to the World Health Organization.\n\u201cAdditionally, using CBD topically reduces the likelihood of experiencing side effects typically associated with CBD use, such as drowsiness, fatigue and diarrhea,\u201d says Dr. Milanes.\nMilanes and Fuentes warn that while CBD itself might be safe, there is a chance you might be allergic or sensitive to another ingredient in a CBD topical, which could cause adverse effects. To avoid unpleasant reactions, they suggest reading ingredient lists carefully.\nPhan also recommends talking to your doctor before using CBD if you\u2019re on any medications\u2014 especially blood pressure medications because CBD can also lower blood pressure.\nIs CBD Cream Safe?\nBecause CBD creams aren\u2019t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as topical drug products, it\u2019s difficult to determine their safety and efficacy as a product category. However, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) reports that topical CBD products may be effective in treating conditions including acne, psoriasis and eczema with few or no side effects. Ultimately, safety and efficacy depend on the specific CBD cream product and its formulation."

Our list exclusively includes products that are third-party tested for quality and efficacy and may be a great place to start your search for CBD gummies for sleep.\nHow many CBD gummies for sleep should you take?\nFollow the instructions on the packaging of the CBD gummies you plan to take, as dose often varies from product to product.\nDr. Ratner suggests starting with a low dose of 10 to 20 milligrams of CBD to first see how you react. If it goes well, you can slowly increase your dose as needed.\nDo CBD gummies for sleep have intoxicating effects?\nCBD itself does not create intoxicating effects. The \u201chigh\u201d associated with cannabis comes from the cannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Full-spectrum CBD products can contain up to 0.3% THC by dry weight, which isn\u2019t enough to have intoxicating effects. If you want to avoid THC altogether, look for broad-spectrum or CBD isolate products instead.\nWhat happens if you eat expired CBD gummies?\n\u201cOnce it has passed its expiration date, the CBD will start losing its potency and eventually lose its effectiveness entirely,\u201d says Heifitz. \u201cYou might notice a change in the taste of the gummy as well, but nothing bad should happen to you.\u201d\nHeifitz recommends following the storage instructions listed on your chosen CBD product and minding its expiration date to maintain both its shelf life and potency.\nHow long do CBD gummies last?\nResearch suggests that the effects of CBD can last up to two to four hours after consumption."
