  "title": "3 Streaming Stocks To Consider As Sports Deals Take Off - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)",
  "description": "",
  "content": "The National Football League\u2019s deal to take a 10% stake in Disney DIS may have broken the huddle, but deals between entertainment heavyweights and college and sports leagues were already showing signs of acceleration.\n\nTake Fox Sports\u2019 2025 pickup of IndyCar, including the Indianapolis 500, for $30 million annually, which just generated a 41% viewer increase in its Memorial Day weekend broadcast. Or the Paramount Skydance PSKY and Ultimate Financial Championship (UFC) mid-August $7.7 billion deal that runs through the next seven years.\n\nHow Matt Maley Is Positioning For The Next Wave Of August Volatility\n\nThe next market surge could hit in days. Matt Maley is already mapping ETF trades designed to capture short bursts of momentum and close fast. This Sunday, he'll show you how to prepare, what setups he's watching now, and how you can cold target high-potential trades while managing risk. Seats are limited \u2014 secure yours now. CTA: Join the Free Session HERE\n\nClearly, the days of the legacy broadcast sports are fading in favor of digital streaming service deals.\n\n\u201cIn general, we think the upward trajectory in streaming prices will meet some resistance, particularly if the economy weakens,\u201d said Dave Novosel, senior investment analyst, telecom, media, and technology at Gimme Credit in Orland Park, Illinois. \u201cYet sports are popular enough that consumers may be willing to pay up, even in a softer economic environment, which bodes well for ESPN and its new offering.\u201d\n\n3 Stocks To Watch as Streaming Channels And Sports Strike New Deals\n\nThe question for shareholders is not which channel the Eagles and Cowboys will be on to kick off the NFL season in three weeks (it\u2019s NBC and Peacock, by the way), but what the mounting streaming mega-deals mean to big media stocks.\n\nAs this process unfolds, these media stocks warrant review by investors as a new era dawns on the sports viewing landscape.\n\nDisney\u2019s NFL/ESPN deal is a striking example of the new era of sports/media partnerships, raising as many questions as it does answers for investors.\n\n\u201cDisney pulled a ruthless swap in handing the NFL a 10% ESPN stake to swallow NFL Network and RedZone, turning ESPN\u2019s moat into a content super-dam before its $29.99 DTC launch,\u201d said Eric Schiffer, chairman at Reputation Management Consultants in Orange County, California.\n\nThe tie-up is a distribution flex that may well vex viewers and Disney shareholders. \u201cThe NFL RedZone inside ESPN turbocharges subscriber lifetime value (LTV) and slaps a surcharge on rivals trying to match that Sunday sugar high,\u201d Schiffer said. \u201cGuidance marched higher, as Disney touts stronger profitability.\u201d\n\nThe NFL deal should be a great addition for Disney since football is the most valuable content available and has been for decades.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is also costly, which is why Disney was willing to give up a 10% stake,\u201d Novosel said. \u201cThe deal should support further revenue growth at ESPN, but may not add to margins because of costs involved. Furthermore, the Disney experiences segment generates twice as much revenue and more than three times as much operating income as the ESPN segment. So, the financial impact is muted to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nCNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer made news last week, calling Paramount Skydance a \u201cmeme stock\u201d in the immediate aftermath of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nThe deal, which closed on August 7, molds both media giants into Paramount Skydance Corporation. Skydance is doing most of the heavy lifting, purchasing National Amusements for $2.4 billion, shelling out $4.5 billion to Paramount shareholders, and pouring $1.5 billion into Paramount\u2019s balance sheet. Skydance founder David Ellison also assumes the PSKY CEO position.\n\nThe company\u2019s $7.7 billion deal with TKO Group Holdings, which operates the UFC, breaks down to $1.1 billion annually and launches in 2026. Under the deal terms, Paramount Skydance now holds the exclusive media rights to all UFC events, including the popular \u201cFight Nights\u201d events and the UFC\u2019s numbered events, which routinely draw large audiences. All UFC events will be shown on the Paramount+ streaming platform.\n\nSector analysts are on board, with PSKY landing a massive viewer subscription base and an estimated $300 million in annualized advertising revenues.\n\n\u201cWe view today\u2019s UFC rights agreement (and interest in future international rights) as a meaningful indication of the company\u2019s strategy to bolster its sports and streaming assets,\u201d stated Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris in a new research note.\n\nAmazon\u2019s AMZN Prime service has also made a big splash in the sports streaming space with its rising NFL streaming service, which company CEO Andy Jassy hopes to pull Prime into the black in 2026. Amazon has invested $3 billion annually in streaming sports content, with a particular focus on the NFL and the NBA.\n\nIn 2024, Amazon was among a group including Disney/ESPN and NBC Universal to land NBA games via an 11-year, $77 billion deal with the league. Meanwhile, it accelerates its existing NFL deal to exclusive NFL game broadcasts, showing 16 Thursday night games along with a Black Friday and wild-card playoff game in the new year. In August 2024, Amazon Prime signed a $100 million deal with the Kelce brothers for their popular sports podcast, further embedding itself in the NFL ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAmazon is an ironclad flywheel in the streaming market, with ad-free surcharges, deep pockets, and live-sports ambitions which will keep Prime Video in the monetization slipstream,\u201d Schiffer said.\n\nAmazon Prime ceded some ground to rival Alphabet GOOG, which landed the popular NFL Ticket package, which Schiffer cited as \u201cformidable\u201d in the combative NFL viewing landscape. Big hedge funds are increasingly bullish on AMZN shares, with Tiger Global Management hiking its share allotment by 62.2% in the second quarter of 2025, according to its latest 13F filing.\n\nEditorial content from our expert contributors is intended to be information for the general public and not individualized investment advice.

      "text": "In a strategic pivot, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN is redirecting its Prime Video efforts towards live sports content, a move aimed at achieving profitability by the end of 2025.\nWhat Happened: Amazon.com is pivoting its Prime Video strategy towards live sports, moving away from original TV shows and movies, according to a report by The Information. This strategic shift is aimed at meeting internal profit targets by the end of 2025.\nAccording to the report, Amazon is investing approximately $3 billion annually in sports content, including broadcasting rights for major leagues like the NBA and NFL. This move is part of CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s plan to make Prime Video profitable.\nThe focus on live sports is driven by the potential for targeted advertising opportunities during real-time viewership.\nIn July, Amazon, alongside Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp., secured an 11-year deal valued at $77 billion to broadcast NBA games. The company has also started integrating ads within its Prime Video platform to enhance revenue streams.\nThe report highlights that after a 2022 planning meeting, Amazon\u2019s entertainment team has reduced the commissioning of new film and TV projects. For 2024, the company\u2019s budget for original and licensed content, including live sports was around $7 billion.\nWhy It Matters: This shift towards live sports is part of Amazon\u2019s broader strategy to capitalize on the lucrative sports market. In August 2024, Amazon signed a $100 million deal with the Kelce brothers for their popular sports podcast, further embedding itself in the NFL ecosystem.\nThis aligns with CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s vision to keep advertising minimal compared to competitors like Netflix and YouTube, as noted in an August statement.\nAdditionally, Amazon\u2019s introduction of an ad-supported version of Prime Video has disrupted the streaming ad market, compelling rivals like Netflix to adjust their ad pricing strategies, as reported in June 2024. This strategic focus on live sports and innovative advertising models is part of Amazon\u2019s efforts to enhance its competitive edge and profitability in the streaming industry.\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\nRead Next:\nMeta\u2019s Threads To Introduce Ads In US, Japan As It Looks To Monetize Rival Of Elon Musk\u2019s X\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
