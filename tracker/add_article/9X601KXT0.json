      "summary": "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is set to hold a conference call with his counterparts from France, Germany, and the UK to discuss the potential reimposition of UN sanctions over its nuclear program, ahead of a looming deadline. The European nations have expressed increasing concern over Iran's uranium enrichment activities, especially after Tehran ceased cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following the recent Iran-Israel conflict. The deadline for reaching a satisfactory solution is August 31, and failure to do so could trigger the 'snapback' mechanism, allowing sanctions to be reinstated.",
