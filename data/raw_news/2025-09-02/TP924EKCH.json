  "title": "Why Circle Internet (CRCL) Stock Fell 28.1% Last Month",
  "description": "Key PointsCircle's first earnings report as a public company revealed a $482 million net loss, largely due to IPO-related costs.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Circle's first earnings report as a public company revealed a $482 million net loss, largely due to IPO-related costs.\n\u2022 None The company earns 96.4% of its revenue from interest on the dollar reserves backing its USDC stablecoin.\n\u2022 None Circle followed the same boom-and-bust pattern seen in other major 2025 IPOs like CoreWeave and Figma.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Circle Internet Group \u203a\n\nShares of Circle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL) took a 28.1% hit in August 2025, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The group behind the USDC (CRYPTO: USDC) stablecoin posted its first earnings report as a public company in the middle of the month, and it wasn't strong enough to support Circle's early price jump.\n\nFrom the initial public offering (IPO) on June 4 to the end of July, Circle's stock had gained a hair-raising 492%. Investors were watching the first earnings report closely, looking for signs that Circle's business could sustain a $42.0 billion market cap.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nBut that bullish outcome wasn't in the cards. Sure, the results were impressive, given that Circle's core business is based on an asset that will always be worth $1 per coin. Revenue rose 53% year over year to $658 million as the active circulation of USDC nearly doubled to $61.3 billion. But Circle still posted a net loss of $482 million in the second quarter, largely due to costs associated with the IPO. The price spike itself was the root cause of these charges, as the skyrocketing stock price changed the value of Circle's convertible debt and stock-based compensation policies.\n\nIt may sound strange that Circle generated a $658 million revenue stream in the second quarter, even though the USDC stablecoin neither gained nor lost any value. But the company operates much like a classic bank -- it earns interest on the dollar-based funds that provide direct backing for the stablecoin. These interest payments accounted for 96.4% of Circle's total revenue in the second quarter.\n\nAs for the stock's price drop, it should be noted that the slide started well before Circle's earnings report. As of Sept. 2, Circle's share price is down 54.4% from the absolute peak on June 23. The big surge followed by a steep price drop is pretty common for big-name IPOs, and Circle was one of the most anticipated market launches in recent memory.\n\nOnly CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) and Figma (NYSE: FIG) have seen splashier IPOs in 2025, and they have indeed followed similar charting patterns. Figma's stock is down 46.2% from a soaring peak just after its IPO in July, while CoreWeave took a couple of months to build a 359% gain and then lose nearly half of it.\n\nI rarely jump on IPO launches, because early investors tend to get burned rather quickly. Circle provided yet another example of a well-worn charting drama. And I'm not entirely convinced that Circle's cool-off period has ended yet. You should probably avoid this red-hot financial technology stock until it stabilizes at a more plausible valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Circle Internet Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Circle Internet Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Circle Internet Group wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $651,599!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,067,639!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,049% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nAnders Bylund has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Shorthand for \"market capitalization,\" market cap is one way an investor can evaluate how much a company is worth. Market cap refers to the total value of a publicly traded company's shares.\nTo determine a company's market cap, simply multiply the share price by the number of shares outstanding.\nAn example of market capitalization\nAn example of market capitalization\nHere's Costco Wholesale (COST -0.5%) as an example. At recent prices, Costco shares sell for $900, with around 450 million shares outstanding. In this case, $900 times 450 million equals a $400 billion market cap.\nBut why is market cap important and how should you use it? It's one of the best measures of a publicly traded company's size, which can tell you a lot about what to expect if you buy its stock.\n- Large companies tend to have more stable and mature businesses, having proven themselves over time and weathered difficult business conditions to emerge stronger. However, the growth prospects for large companies can be limited because they've already taken advantage of their primary opportunities to grow to their current size.\n- Smaller companies often have more room to grow, but they are typically younger, with riskier business models that haven't yet proved themselves. Their odds of failure can be higher than those of larger companies, which presents added risk.\nHere's a quick breakdown of how market cap ranges are often segmented across companies of different sizes:\n| Type of Stock | Market Capitalization Range |\n|---|---|\n| Mega cap | More than $200 billion |\n| Large cap | $10 billion to $200 billion |\n| Mid cap | $2 billion to $10 billion |\n| Small cap | $300 million to $2 billion |\n| Micro cap | $50 million to $300 million |\nIn general, investors look at the market in the following three categories most often since these are the market cap categories most stocks tend to fall into.\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nLarge-cap stocks have market caps of more than $10 billion. Most of the best-known companies in the world are large caps, and these are typically the companies that have established themselves as the leaders in their industries. While many deal with the ups and downs of their industry's cycles, these are often the strongest companies and have proven capable of holding off competitive threats. Large caps are often where you'll find the best dividend stocks. These large companies often generate more cash than they need for the business and return that extra capital to investors in dividend payments.\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nMid-cap stocks have market caps between $2 and $10 billion, occupying the middle ground between large and small companies. Mid-cap companies often have made considerable progress in building up successful business models, and that gives their investors some stability and protection against the future challenges smaller companies may face. Yet even with some track record, mid caps also may face the daunting task of beating out, or even disrupting, bigger and better-funded large-cap competitors to realize their own financial promise.\nNot all mid caps are growth stocks. They may be companies that operate in a smaller niche without big growth prospects, or they may be former large caps that have declined due to changes in the competitive landscape or (as with many brick-and-mortar retailers) some industry disruption.\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nSmall-cap stocks are generally defined as having market caps between $300 million and $2 billion. Sometimes companies with market caps below $300 million are in this group, although most categorize those as micro-cap stocks. They are generally growth stocks or upstarts just getting their feet under them and looking to do something big. While small-cap stocks have historically delivered above-average returns as a group, many fail to live up to expectations. Small-cap stocks are more volatile than larger caps, meaning there is more risk of losses in the short term. These stocks are generally best owned as a diversified group, and for many years, in order to reduce those risks.\nDividends Per Share\nHow to use market cap\nHow to use market cap\nMarket cap is helpful when evaluating a company's size. But don't let the market value of a company cause you to dismiss large- or even mega-cap stocks as \"too big to buy.\" The global economy is enormous, serving more than 7 billion people and with a fast-growing middle class. A $10 billion company that serves a multi-trillion-dollar market can grow substantially.\nMoreover, companies can deliver strong per-share returns without expanding their market cap fast. Share repurchases that reduce the share count reward long-term investors with a bigger piece of the company, while dividends put money directly back into your pocket. These two things combined can significantly reduce how much market cap needs to grow for investors to get above-average returns.\nRelated investing topics\nConversely, companies -- often small caps that need the cash -- may sell stock to fund growth, pay debt, or just keep the lights on. When this happens, it reduces -- dilutes -- how much of the company each share is worth. For example, if a company with 10 million shares issues and sells 1 million new shares, 10% of your former equity now belongs to the new shareholders. The key here is to consider a company's history of share buybacks and dilution.\nMost investors find that having a diversified portfolio that includes stocks of various market caps is best. It lets you tailor for the desired return and risk levels that meet your goals. If you want your portfolio to be more stable, you'll want a bigger allocation of large-cap stocks. If your primary goal is to increase your portfolio's size as much possible over many years, you'll likely want to own more small- and mid-cap stocks."

      "text": "Even novice investors have probably heard the term \"IPO\" before. IPO stands for \"initial public offering\" in the stock market. A privately held company that completes an IPO offers shares of itself to the public for the first time. The newly issued shares begin trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.\nWhat does it mean when a company goes public? It means that it completes an IPO (or similar process) and makes its stock available to investors. Shares of pre-IPO companies or private companies are generally owned by just a small group of company insiders and employees, as well as early investors such as venture capitalists.\nHow does an IPO work?\nHow does an IPO work?\nAny privately held company can go public through an IPO. Companies that complete IPOs are often fast-growing companies in the tech industry or another high-growth sector. However, they can also be mature companies -- such as Petco (WOOF -9.4%) and Levi Strauss (LEVI 1.25%) -- that are owned by private equity firms seeking to exit their positions. Some of the most attractive IPOs are \"unicorns,\" or tech start-ups valued at more than $1 billion in the private markets.\nWhen a company is ready to go public, it hires an investment bank (or several banks) to underwrite the IPO. Generally, a company goes public after it has a proven track record of growth and other favorable results that are attractive to investors. Banks underwrite IPOs by committing money to buy the shares being offered before they're listed on any public exchange.\nAnother role of the underwriter is to perform due diligence on the company to verify its financial information and analyze its business model and prospects. With the help of the underwriter, the company files a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which includes its prospectus. The purpose of the filing is to provide detailed information on the company's finances, business model, and growth opportunities.\nThe company often meets with institutional investors such as pension funds, foundations, and endowments to make sure the IPO has buyers. After an initial block of shares is sold, the company and its underwriters set an initial public price and a date for the stock to begin trading on a public exchange.\nOn IPO day, the company's stock becomes available to the general public, and the stock then trades among investors on the open market.\nWhy do companies pursue IPOs?\nWhy do companies pursue IPOs?\nThe primary benefit of going public is easier access to capital. The money raised from an IPO can be used for expansion, research and development, marketing, and other purposes.\nIPOs also reward equity holders in the company. Executives, employees, and others who own equity stakes can easily sell their holdings, generally after a lock-up period of six months once the stock is publicly traded. The lock-up period helps stabilize the stock price by preventing insiders from selling all their holdings immediately after the IPO.\nWhile private companies are valued based on private funding rounds, which can be burdensome and time-consuming, public companies are valued based on the market price. There's no additional work for the company to do to raise its valuation, and stock prices have the potential to appreciate much faster than private company valuations, assuming the business warrants it.\nThere are also drawbacks to going public since companies are required to adhere to SEC reporting requirements. Publicly traded companies must issue regular disclosure statements, release their financial results, and conduct quarterly earnings calls, among other requirements. Public companies have fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders and satisfying their demands can cost management control, time, and money -- especially if an activist investor takes an interest in the stock.\nAlternatives to IPOs\nAlternatives to IPOs\nThe traditional IPO process isn't the only option for going public. Increasingly, companies are going public through direct listings. Among the stocks that have gone public through direct listings in recent years are Spotify (SPOT 1.14%), Slack (now owned by Salesforce) (CRM -1.27%), Coinbase (COIN -0.31%), Roblox (RBLX 2.89%), and Amplitude (AMPL -5.86%).\nIn a direct listing, a company simply allows the stock to begin trading on a public exchange such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. No new shares are issued. Rather, the direct listing gives insiders an opportunity to sell their shares on the open market. Going through a direct listing avoids many of the fees associated with underwriters and the need to go through a \"road show,\" or presenting the investment opportunity to institutional investors. It also eliminates the lock-up period necessary for IPOs, allowing insiders and employees to immediately sell their shares.\nA direct listing doesn't raise new capital the way an IPO does; no new shares are offered. It's also riskier in some ways than an IPO since there isn't an underwriter to help drum up demand for the stock. Direct listings tend to work best for well-known companies with an interested investor base and a clear value proposition.\nDutch auctions are also an option for companies seeking to go public without an IPO, although they are less common. Alphabet (GOOG -0.63%) (GOOGL -0.65%) is perhaps the best-known company to go public through a Dutch auction, using the technique in 2004. In a Dutch auction, potential buyers list the price they're willing to pay, and, when the company believes the price is high enough, it sells new shares at that price. Unlike a direct listing, Dutch auctions raise new capital.\nAre IPO stocks good investments?\nAlthough IPOs can be good for the issuing companies, they're not always great for individual investors. Investing in IPOs can be profitable, but it is generally much riskier than investing in blue chip stocks or mature companies. The prices of newly issued stocks often fluctuate wildly on the first trading days because it's not always easy for the stock to find its equilibrium price.\nHowever, IPO stocks can generate huge returns when they succeed. Some of today's top public companies completed their IPOs just a few years ago:\n- Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) debuted on the Nasdaq for $38 a share in 2012 and now trades at prices above $300.\n- Tesla (TSLA -1.39%) priced its 2010 IPO at a split-adjusted $3.40 per share. The stock price skyrocketed in 2020 and is now above $1,000 a share, representing a gain of roughly 30,000%.\n- E-commerce juggernaut Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has jumped more than 6,000% from its 2015 IPO price of $17 to more than $1,000.\nOf course, for every big IPO winner, there are a number of losers, most of which are quickly forgotten by the market. Lyft (LYFT 3.76%), for example, debuted in 2019 at $72, but it is down roughly 50% since then. The ridesharing company was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and visions of self-driving cars haven't been fulfilled. Earlier high-profile tech IPOs such as GoPro (GPRO -4.49%) and Fitbit also flopped, leading to billions of dollars in losses for investors.\nRelated Investing Topics\nIPO stocks can be great investments, but, historically, most underperform the market. The stock market, especially the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) -- as a large-cap benchmark index -- is generally composed of successful, profitable companies. Failing and failed companies don't continue to be listed by major indexes.\nIPO stocks, which are unproven, may not live up to their potential. Before investing in IPO stocks, take the time to vet the issuing companies carefully.\nFAQs\nWhat does IPO stand for?\nInitial public offering\nWhat does IPO mean?\nIPO refers to the time when a privately held company offers shares of itself to the public for the first time, trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.\nWhat does it mean when a company goes public?\nIt means that that company has made its stock available to retail investors for the first time.\nShould you invest in IPOs?\nYou should invest according to your personal risk tolerance, with the knowledge that most IPOs underperform the market."

      "text": "Valuation is the process of figuring out what something is worth. Spoiler alert: Stocks and other assets usually don't cost (the price) what they're truly worth (the value) -- they can be either overpriced or underpriced. Investors can achieve better long-term returns by consistently identifying investments that are mispriced and using this knowledge to their advantage.\nOverview\nWhat valuation is\nA company that goes public sells shares to investors, with each representing a small percentage ownership stake in the business. Valuation seeks to determine what those businesses are worth now or what those businesses could be worth at some future date. The process is both a science and an art. It's a science because it's a fundamental analysis that uses numbers and formulas. But it's also an art because investors need to use estimates and make some assumptions as well, injecting a measure of uncertainty. The more uncertainty there is to the valuation process, the harder it is to confidently assign a higher value.\nThere are two major camps when it comes to valuation: intrinsic value and relative value. On one hand, the intrinsic valuation process attempts to predict all of the future cash flows for the life of the asset to determine the present value of the asset. This can be especially helpful when investing in something with a known return (such as a bond) or when buying a business outright. On the other hand, the relative valuation process is especially helpful for stocks since they frequently change hands and usually represent businesses with unknown lifespans. This relative valuation approach applies a premium to the fundamental numbers (20 times a company's profit, for example) based on what the market will support.\nHow it works\nHow valuation works\nInvesting great Warren Buffett prefers the intrinsic valuation method because he acquires businesses outright when the price is attractive. And he once gave a great example at a meeting for shareholders of his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.57%)(BRK.B -0.42%). In the 1970's, he bought See's Candies for $25 million. But it's earned around $2 billion cumulatively in his 50 years of owning it. From this, we see that Buffett clearly bought See's Candies for far below its intrinsic value -- he got far more out of it than what he put into it. And this ultimately means that he made a small fortune from this one investment.\nMost investors aren't buying entire businesses, but many still use the principles of intrinsic value when investing in stocks. However, investors more commonly use relative valuation methods. For example, let's say that you can predict with a high degree of certainty that a shoe company will have earnings per share of $10 within the next five years. Shoe stocks commonly trade at 10 times earnings, if not more. Using a relative valuation method, investors could comfortably predict that this particular shoe stock will be worth $100 per share within the next five years. If that stock trades at, say, $25 per share today, you may have just stumbled upon an undervalued investment opportunity that could help you make your own small fortune.\nMethods\nValuation methods\nIn the above example, investors would use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value my imaginary shoe business. But there are situations when things aren't so simple, and different valuation tools are helpful. For example, companies without earnings can't be valued with a P/E ratio because earnings are literally part of the equation. But this doesn't necessarily mean that those businesses are worthless, so they instead might be valued with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. Additionally, accounting practices can distort profits, which is why many investors like to value a company with the price-to-free cash flow ratio. In short, there are many popular valuation metrics, and each has merits.\nHowever, investors should remember that many metrics share a key shortcoming. Renowned value investor Bill Miller puts it this way, \"One hundred percent of the information you have about a company represents the past, and 100% of the value depends on the future.\" In other words, investors can't solely rely on the known numbers, but rather, they also need to have an opinion about what will happen with the business, the industry, and the economy.\nThis is why having an investment thesis is crucial when investing in a stock. A thesis will address things such as whether a market opportunity will get bigger or smaller, whether business growth will accelerate or decelerate, and whether profit margins will strengthen or deteriorate. By getting a handle on such things, investors can have an idea of the future financial state of the business. From there, they can use a valuation metric, or a combination of metrics, to determine the valuation of the company. This valuation assumption will help them decide whether it's mispriced in their favor today.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nA valuation example\nIn early 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) is a big investing topic and Nvidia (NVDA -1.77%) is a top player in the space. Market analysts have predicted a large market opportunity in AI long before it dominated the headlines. For his part, Nvidia's founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, delivered the first AI supercomputer in 2016. At the time, Nvidia stock was trading at a P/S ratio of about 6.\nLet's say that you were aware of the predictions for the AI space and were familiar with Nvidia's AI-focused products. Perhaps you didn't know exactly how high the company's revenue would soar, but you believed it would go up significantly over the coming decade. Well, even though a P/S ratio of 6 isn't exactly cheap, you still may have concluded that Nvidia stock was undervalued in 2016 because you had a high degree of certainty that it would be an AI leader, and revenue would consequently skyrocket. This is exactly what happened -- Nvidia stock is one of the greatest performers over the last decade, in large part because its revenue is almost 20 times larger today than it was in 2016 when the first AI supercomputer was delivered."

      "text": "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that aim to peg their value to another asset, most often a fiat currency. For example, a U.S. dollar stablecoin is designed to maintain a value of $1. Since most cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, stablecoins are an alternative for those who want a digital currency with a fixed value.\nIt's a common misconception that stablecoins are safe and can be counted on to maintain the intended value. Although that's the goal, they can lose their pegs, so they're not risk-free. Stablecoins serve a key role in the crypto market, but before you buy any, it's important to understand how they work.\nTypes of stablecoins\nTypes of stablecoins\nThere are four types of stablecoins:\n- Fiat-backed stablecoins\n- Crypto-backed stablecoins\n- Commodity-backed stablecoins\n- Algorithmic stablecoins\nAs you can see, it's the backing or collateral that determines the type of stablecoin. You'll find more details on each type below.\nFiat-backed stablecoins\nFiat-backed stablecoins have a fiat currency reserve. The reserves are collateral that guarantee the value of the stablecoin and should be equal in value to the circulating supply. For example, a fiat-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin with 1 million coins in circulation should have $1 million in reserves.\nThis type of stablecoin is normally safe if the organization managing it has sufficient reserves. To verify its reserves, the organization should provide regular audits by an independent third party.\nFiat Currency\nCrypto-backed stablecoins\nCrypto-backed stablecoins have cryptocurrency reserves. They generally use one of the larger cryptocurrencies as collateral, such as Bitcoin (BTC 1.57%) or Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH).\nSince cryptocurrencies are volatile, this type of stablecoin needs to be over-collateralized. Its reserves should be significantly greater in value than its circulating supply to account for price fluctuations.\nCommodity-backed stablecoins\nCommodity-backed stablecoins have reserves made up of physical assets, such as precious metals, real estate, and oil. The most common type of commodities used to back stablecoins are precious metals, specifically gold.\nThis type of stablecoin is pegged to its reserve asset. For example, a gold-backed stablecoin would be pegged to the value of gold. The advantage for investors is that they can purchase digital versions of commodities without needing to obtain or store the actual physical asset.\nAlgorithmic stablecoins\nAlgorithmic stablecoins control the circulating supply using algorithms and smart contracts. They may not have reserves, and, if they do, they're typically under-collateralized. Algorithms reduce the supply if the stablecoin's price is lower than the asset it tracks and mint more coins if it's higher. It's similar to how central banks operate by printing and destroying fiat money.\nThese stablecoins are riskier because they don't have sufficient reserves to dip into if they face issues. TerraUSD (USTC 1.56%) is a famous example of how this can go wrong. This algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg in May 2022, and the value plummeted.\nWhat makes stablecoins unique?\nWhat makes stablecoins unique?\nThe thing that makes stablecoins different is that they mimic another asset's value. Other cryptocurrencies have prices based on what they offer and market demand; stablecoin prices depend on the asset they're following.\nThis gives stablecoins some advantages over traditional cryptocurrencies. Most notably, a stablecoin is much better suited for being an actual digital currency that you can store, transfer, or use to pay for goods and services. Because it has a stable value, you don't need to worry about price fluctuations.\nWhere stablecoins came from\nWhere stablecoins came from\nJ.R. Willett, a member of the early Bitcoin community, is considered the inventor of stablecoins. He came up with the idea of asset-pegged cryptocurrencies in 2012 and mentioned it in the white paper for his MasterCoin protocol.\nThe first stablecoin was BitUSD, a crypto-backed stablecoin that launched in 2014. It lost its peg to the U.S. dollar in 2018 and never recovered. The first fiat-backed stablecoin, Tether (USDT -0.0%), launched later in 2014. Although it has gone through some controversies and price fluctuations, for the most part Tether has maintained its peg.\nHow stablecoins work\nHow stablecoins work\nMost stablecoins maintain reserves. The organization behind a stablecoin adds to the reserves when it mints new coins.\nIt's easiest to explain by using an example. A fiat-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin, such as USD Coin (USDC -0.01%), needs reserves equal to the number of coins it has in circulation. It can maintain reserves by increasing and reducing the supply as people buy and sell their coins.\nLet's say you decide to buy $100 in USD Coin. The $100 you pay is added to that stablecoin's reserves, and 100 USDC is minted and sent to you. If you decide to sell your 100 USDC, they'll be bought back using $100 from the reserves and then removed from circulation.\nThere are many stablecoins out there, and they don't all work the same way, but the general idea is usually the same. Whether a stablecoin is backed by fiat money, crypto, or a commodity, funds are added to the reserves as coins are minted. The exception is an algorithmic stablecoin since it relies on algorithms instead of a reserve system.\nStablecoin and crypto research\nStablecoin and crypto research\nStablecoin examples\nStablecoin examples\nHere are a few prominent examples of stablecoins:\n- Tether is a U.S. dollar stablecoin. It's the largest stablecoin by market cap and normally has the highest daily trading volume of any cryptocurrency.\n- USD Coin is a U.S. dollar stablecoin and the first cryptocurrency chosen by Visa (V -0.55%) for settling transactions.\n- PAX Gold (PAXG 0.92%) is a gold-backed stablecoin designed to make gold more easily tradeable.\n- Dai (DAI -0.16%) is a crypto-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin. It's managed by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.\nCan I make passive income with stablecoins?\nCan I make passive income with stablecoins?\nYou can make passive income with stablecoins through crypto lending programs. Stablecoins, especially those that follow fiat currencies, are popular choices for lending because of their stable prices. Since a stablecoin's value won't drop -- assuming it doesn't lose its peg -- it's safer to lend out than other types of cryptocurrencies.\nKeep in mind that crypto lending has its risks. Most crypto lending programs stipulate in their terms that they're not responsible for lost funds. If borrowers default, you could lose money.\nUnique risks\nUnique risks\nThe biggest danger with stablecoins is that they're not guaranteed to maintain their pegs. It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming a stablecoin will always have the same value as the asset it follows, but plenty of stablecoins have failed over the years.\nTerraUSD is a cautionary tale that illustrates what can go wrong with stablecoins. It was part of the Terra (LUNA 2.12%) ecosystem, and it attracted a huge number of investors because of Terra's Anchor Protocol. Anchor was like a savings account that offered users an APY of almost 20% on their TerraUSD deposits.\nIt worked out well until TerraUSD lost its peg during a period of heavy market volatility. The price dropped from $1 to less than $0.20 in a matter of days and eventually fell below $0.02. Investors who had put their life savings in TerraUSD lost almost everything.\nThat's (almost) a worst-case scenario, and there are more secure stablecoins. However, the bottom line is that no stablecoin is 100% secure. There's no guarantee that a stablecoin will always be exchangeable for the asset it's pegged to, and you don't get the same protections from stablecoins that you do from money in a bank account.\nAre stablecoins a good investment?\nAre stablecoins a good investment?\nStablecoins generally aren't investments, but they can be a good choice for investors who want to build passive income streams.\nSince stablecoins aim to maintain a set value, they aren't made for investing. The price of a stablecoin will ideally be the same in the future as it is today, in which case whatever you buy will be worth the same as when you bought it. If you're interested in cryptocurrency investing, you're better off buying coins that could increase in value.\nWhere stablecoins work very well is generating passive income through crypto lending. Crypto lending programs often pay high interest rates on stablecoins. Make sure to spend plenty of time researching both the stablecoin and the lending program to evaluate the security they offer.\nStablecoins are also a convenient way to invest in digital representations of commodities. Let's say you've decided to invest in precious metals and want to add gold to your portfolio. Instead of buying and storing gold bars, you could invest in a gold-backed stablecoin. Once again, it's important to research any commodity-backed stablecoins you're thinking of buying.\nHow to buy stablecoins\nHow to buy stablecoins\nIf you want to buy stablecoins and you have an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, check which options your exchange has available. Many of the biggest crypto exchanges sell at least one or two U.S. dollar stablecoins. The fastest option is buying on an exchange where you're already signed up.\nIf you want a specific stablecoin, check which exchanges have it available. Motley Fool Money, a Motley Fool site, provides information on cryptocurrency availability at major exchanges. This can help you track down the exchanges that carry stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies you want.\nThe best way to look at buying stablecoins is that you're really buying the organization that issues the stablecoin. You're trusting that organization to keep the value of the coin where it should be. Before you buy, spend time learning about the organization's reputation and review how the stablecoin maintains its peg."
