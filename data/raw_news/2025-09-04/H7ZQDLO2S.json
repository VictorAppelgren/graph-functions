  "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Gregor Stuart HunterJittery bond markets found reasons for calm as members of the Federal Reserve sounded a supportive note for rate cuts and Japan's latest super-long debt auction passed without incident.\n\nMarkets stabilised after an auction of 30-year Japanese government bonds on Thursday met with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.31, after the yield on similarly-dated debt rose to a record. Though demand was the lowest since June, the takeup was sufficient to stop a fresh wave of anxiety gripping the bond market for now.\n\nU.S. stock futures clung to gains of 0.1% afterwards, with investors in Asia taking a boost to sentiment after Federal Reserve officials, including Governor Christopher Waller, reiterated support for rate cuts in the months ahead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's pick to fill an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board, Stephen Miran, also said he would work to preserve the central bank's independence ahead of a Senate confirmation hearing later today.\n\nTraders are now pricing in a 96.6% probability of a cut to interest rates at the Fed's September meeting, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 4.2187% compared with its U.S. close of 4.211% on Wednesday, while the U.S. dollar index clawed back 0.1% to 98.231.\n\nIn early European trades, pan-region futures were flat, German DAX futures slipped 0.1% and FTSE futures were up 0.1%.\n\nBut MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gave up early gains and was last down 0.2%, dragged lower by losses in China.\n\nThe blue-chip CSI 300 fell 2.5% and was on track for its biggest one-day selloff since April after a Bloomberg News report that financial regulators are preparing cooling measures for the market.\n\nThat sent the SSE STAR 50 Index skidding 5.4% lower, as GPU chip designer Cambricon Technologies, a standout of the recent rally, fell as much as 13.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian shares jumped on the open after the government slashed levies on several goods to fire up consumption and counteract U.S. tariffs, with the BSE Sensex up 1.1% as markets opened.\n\nPrecious metal prices fell, with spot gold off 0.8% at $3,531.63 per ounce after hitting a record on Wednesday.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Thursday:",
