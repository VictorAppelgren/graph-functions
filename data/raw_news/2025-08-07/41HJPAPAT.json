  "title": "After uproar, 'South Park' pummels Trump again and hits at JD Vance, Kristi Noem",
  "description": "\"South Park\" doubled down on its parody of President Donald Trump in its latest episode, which also spoofed JD Vance and Kristi Noem.",
  "content": "\"South Park\" is back to once again mock President Donald Trump \u2014 and this time, Vice President JD Vance, too.\n\nThe Comedy Central show took aim at the president, as well as Vance and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in its latest episode, \"Got A Nut,\" which aired on Aug. 6.\n\nThe episode revolves around school counselor Mr. Mackey being fired from his job and, because he's desperate for money, joining Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A parody ad for the federal agency mocks its recruitment process, with a jingle declaring, \"We don't ask for experience, just show up!\"\n\nMr. Mackey is hired by ICE on the spot and watches a recruitment video where Noem repeatedly shoots dogs, a reference to her 2024 revelation that she shot and killed an \"untrainable\" family dog. His first ICE raid is on a \"Dora the Explorer\" live show, where Noem immediately shoots a service dog in the crowd. Later, ICE conducts a raid on heaven, and Noem tells agents, \"Remember, only detain the brown ones.\"\n\nMr. Mackey is eventually invited to Mar-a-Lago, where Trump offers to make him the \"new face of Homeland Security\" because Noem's \"face freaks me out.\" Trump then brings Mr. Mackey into his bedroom, where he takes off his pants and introduces Satan, who is reading a book in bed. Mr. Mackey freaks out upon seeing Satan and quickly leaves.\n\nDuring the Mar-a-Lago sequence, Vance is depicted with the body and voice of a small child, and at one point, Trump gets annoyed and kicks him so hard that he flies off screen. The closing credits of the episode show Noem on a shooting spree in a pet store.\n\nThe latest \"South Park\" episode aired two weeks after the show made waves with its parody of Trump in the Season 27 premiere, \"Sermon on the 'Mount.\"\n\nThe episode showed Trump getting into bed with Satan, depicting him like the series has portrayed Saddam Hussein in the past. \"South Park\" previously used an original character, Mr. Garrison, as an analogue for Trump, but Season 27 made a shift by parodying Trump himself using real photos of the president placed on an animated body.\n\n\"Sermon on the 'Mount\" centered on Trump suing South Park until the town reaches a settlement and agrees to do pro-Trump messaging. The episode ended with a faux public service announcement showing a live-action Trump walking through the desert and removing all his clothes.\n\nIn a statement provided to USA TODAY, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers slammed \"South Park\" in response to the Trump parody episode.\n\n\"This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention,\" the White House's statement said. \"President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history \u2014 and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak.\"\n\nIn a subsequent appearance at San Diego Comic-Con on July 24, \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone sarcastically apologized for the Trump episode, quipping, \"We're terribly sorry.\"\n\nAhead of the follow-up episode, the Department of Homeland Security on Aug. 5 shared an image on X of ICE's depiction in this week's \"South Park\" along with a link on how to join the agency. The series' official X account quickly shot back, \"Wait, so we ARE relevant?\"",

      "text": "'South Park' trolls DHS for using screengrab to recruit ICE agents: 'So we ARE relevant?'\nJust when some fans thought the feud between \"South Park\" and the White House reached an impasse.\nThe raunchy comedy showed no signs of easing up this week, with more jabs at President Donald Trump as a 20-second teaser for its Aug. 6 episode featured an image of Trump sitting at a dinner table with Satan. The moment depicts Trump rubbing Satan's leg under the table before Satan tells him to stop.\nDespite the ongoing satirical jabs, Homeland Security's official X account shared a screengrab from that trailer to encourage people to apply for jobs at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The still depicts multiple masked and armed ICE agents storming a road in the same direction, with a link to the agency's careers page.\n\"Wait, so we ARE relevant?\" the \"South Park\" X account replied to the Aug. 5 post before telling the agency to \"eat a bag of [expletive].\"\nThe show's Season 27 premiere last month made a not-so-subtle dig at Trump, who was depicted cuddling in bed with Satan, his lover, using actual photos of the president crudely placed on an animated body. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers later dismissed the episode, calling the Comedy Central staple a \"fourth-rate show\" that \"hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.\"\nThe controversial episode, titled \"Sermon on the Mount,\" proved to be a ratings juggernaut, marking the show's most-watched season premiere since 1999, with viewership up 68% from last season's premiere, according to Paramount Global.\nThe Aug. 5 post from Homeland Security comes amid a massive recruitment campaign to hire more than 14,000 immigration agents, attorneys, and other workers. Through his federal spending plan, Trump aims to have enough ICE agents to execute his border crackdown and the goal of deporting 1 million people a year.\nWhat time does the next 'South Park' episode drop?\nThe newest episode of \"South Park\" Season 27 is set to drop Wednesday, Aug. 6, at 10 p.m. ET/PT on Comedy Central.\nThe episode will be available to stream on Paramount+ the following day, Aug. 7, at 6 am ET/3 a.m. PT, according to the streaming platform.\nContributing: Brendan Morrow, Trevor Hughes, Sara Chernikoff, and Fernando Cervantes Jr., USA TODAY"

      "text": "The star of 'Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado' says 'I can't believe this is my life'\nNEW YORK \u2013 Samantha Lorraine gets emotional as she thinks about her journey from childhood fan of \"Dora the Explorer\" to the actress who plays her on screen. Lorraine takes on the title character in the live-action movie \"Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado\" (streaming now on Paramount+).\n\"Everybody in Miami grew up with (Dora),\" Lorraine, 18, recalls of her upbringing, saying her diverse group of friends loved the animated series. \"Getting to see my little cousins watch the trailer and hearing them say, 'Oh, like Sammy (is) Dora!' I can't believe this is my life.\"\nAs Lorraine talks about filming the movie in Colombia, trying on Dora's trademark pink shirt and orange shorts outfit and seeing the movie's billboard in Times Square, the actress exudes the same positive, can-do energy of the character she portrays. But that doesn't mean she replicates Dora's personality exactly. In one scene where Dora is trying to cheer up her cousin Diego (Jacob Rodriguez), the explorer tells him, \"A change in latitude can help that attitude.\"\n\"I would try to think that in my brain,\" Lorraine says with a laugh, admitting she probably wouldn't use that exact quote in an unfortunate situation. But she enjoyed the opportunity to embody Dora's go-getter attitude. \"Hopefully, in a few years to come, people look back and think it's a classic movie for families.\"\nWhat happens in the new 'Dora' movie?\nIn \"Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado,\" the bilingual explorer is 16 and attempts to find the treasures of Sol Dorado before an enemy group discovers them first. Diego joins his younger cousin on the journey, although his mind is in other places, namely New York City, where he's hoping to continue his career. Gabriel Iglesias voices Boots, who returns as Dora's pet monkey and, unlike the 2019 live-action film, is actually wearing his boots.\nAs seen in the movie's trailer, Dora's explorations take a detour when she loses her beloved map.\n\"It's a sort of a symbolic message for grief in a way,\" Lorraine says of the plot twist. \"'Who am I without those things because they're so important to me?' No matter what external things happen around you, you are who you are. And if you know who you are, you're good. You're set for life.\"\nThe live-action reboot is a part of a celebration marking the 25th anniversary of \"Dora the Explorer.\" The franchise launched on Aug. 14, 2000, and received 15 Daytime Emmy nominations, winning for best title design in 2011. The series also earned a Peabody Award in 2004 and two NAACP Awards.\n\"I would do anything to come back to the 'Dora-verse,'\" Lorraine responds when asked about her future with the character. \"I don't want to change how it turned out because it's so epic, but I always think about the memories that we created and I think, 'How can we recreate that? How can I do that again?' \"\nWho is Samantha Lorraine?\nBorn Samantha Lorraine Luis, the actress was previously seen in 2020's limited series \"The Walking Dead: World Beyond\" and the 2023 Netflix movie, \"You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah.\" Lorraine's career began when she was 8 after she heard a radio ad for a workshop that offered kids the chance to be the \"next Nickelodeon/Disney star.\" Her parents took her to the workshop where she landed an agent and began her journey to Dora.\nLorraine attended school in Miami and would head to dance practice and casting calls in the evenings. Lorraine's parents kept her in South Florida, as opposed to moving to Los Angeles or New York. The actress is grateful, calling her parents \"my rocks.\"\n\"Kids don't tell their parents often that they love them or appreciate them,\" she says. \"I try to make it a point because they are the reason why I do what I do. And I would not be in this position were it not for them.\""

      "text": "Can 'South Park' take on Trump 2.0? They're walking a tightrope\nThis week's \"South Park\" premiere pulled no punches.\nThe sharply sardonic series skewered President Donald Trump and a hefty settlement Paramount paid to him following a lawsuit over CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" Paramount is the parent company of both CBS and Comedy Central, which airs \"Park.\"\nKnown for a no-holds-barred approach to comedy, \"Park\" (Wednesdays 10 ET/PT) has beckoned controversy for decades, to the delight of its viewers and the ire of its subjects. Created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, it's part of a class of raunchy adult animation programs that burst onto the scene in the late '90s. It stands out among its peers, always deeply reflective and cynical about current events.\nIncorporating pointed criticism of Trump's second term as president into the show might offer a challenge for the writers, however, after a major merger between Paramount and Skydance Media received the green light from Trump's FCC. The merger puts \"Park\" under the stewardship of a company many assume will be aligned with the Trump administration. Skydance executives have made public statements suggesting they have similar opinions on DEI initiatives as Trump, for example. Skydance CEO David Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, the billionaire chairman of Oracle, who has hosted a fundraiser for Trump on his property and donated to Republican-friendly super-PACs.\nParamount too paid a $16 million settlement to Trump earlier this month, after the president sued the company for defamation over an interview \"60 Minutes\" ran with former political rival Vice President Kamala Harris. The company also recently announced the cancellation of CBS' \"The Late Show,\" hosted by Stephen Colbert, a prominent Trump critic.\nAgainst that backdrop, \"Park\" seems to be sending a message to viewers that it has no plans to fall in line.\nThe July 23rd episode, the first of the show's 27th season, depicted Trump literally getting into bed with Satan, his lover, using actual photos of the president crudely placed on an animated body. It's the same depiction that Saddam Hussein received in 1999's \"Park\" movie. The Satan character in the new episode even comments that Trump and Hussein are \"exactly alike.\"\nParamount itself also wasn't safe from the ire of Parker and Stone. The episode also features a pair of animated \"60 Minutes\" anchors covering protests as they nervously praise Trump and insist they don't agree with the protesters, intimating that they might be worried he will sue again.\nThe administration responded in anger.\n\"This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement provided to USA TODAY July 24. \"President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history \u2212 and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak.\"\nThe day after the episode aired, the show's creators, onstage at a San Diego Comic-Con panel, seemed unfazed.\n\"We're terribly sorry,\" Parker said with a sly grin, sitting next to next to Stone. Whether the pair will be able to maintain that \"sorry not sorry\" sentiment as the new season airs remains to be seen, though. Parker and Stone spoke at the Comic-Con panel about how they are making the episodes on the fly in response to the news of the day, and will likely poke at Trump again in the future.\nUnder an administration increasingly intolerant of criticism (comedic or otherwise), \"Park\" finds itself in a difficult bind. The popularity of the show hinges on the very style of comedy that may enrage the Trump White House. To maintain a robust and loyal audience, Parker and Stone will likely need to continue making the politics of the day into punchlines. But to do that, thet may also need to defy the the sensibilities of their newly merged parent company.\nWednesday's episode may provide an important clue, however: It hit the air the same day Paramount inked a five-year agreement for 50 new episodes of \"Park.\"\nContributing: Brendan Morrow, Brian Truitt, Kelly Lawler"

The main plot revolves around the supposed death of \"wokeness\" and the president pushing Christianity in classrooms by having Jesus physically appear at the boys' school. When the parents of South Park get angry and push back, Trump decides to sue the town.\n'South Park' takes aim at Colbert cancellation, '60 Minutes' lawsuit\nThe episode goes on to take aim at Paramount for its controversial settlement with Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, which he alleged was deceptively edited. A pair of \"60 Minutes\" anchors are shown covering the protests in South Park, but they nervously praise Trump and insist they don't agree with the protesters, as if they are worried he will sue again.\nEventually, Jesus arrives at the South Park protest and, speaking nervously with clenched teeth, reveals he came to the kids' school \"because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount.\"\n\"(Trump) can do whatever he wants now that someone backed down,\" Jesus continues, adding, \"You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert? ... Just shut up, or we're going to get canceled, you idiots!\"\nThe episode aired less than a week after the cancellation of Colbert's \"Late Show,\" which CBS said was for financial reasons. But critics accused the network, which Paramount owns, of canceling the show to appease Trump amid a proposed merger with Skydance that requires Trump administration approval. Colbert is a vocal Trump critic and mocks him on almost every episode of \"The Late Show.\"\nThe season premiere ends with the people of South Park settling with Trump and agreeing to do pro-Trump messaging as part of their agreement. So the show cuts to a supposed pro-Trump public service announcement, in which Trump, in live-action, is shown crawling through a desert completely nude.\nWith its surprisingly pointed critique of Paramount, the episode also aired on the same day that Paramount announced a five-year agreement with Parker and Stone for 50 new episodes of \"South Park.\"\nThis story has been updated to include additional information."

      "text": "National Guard to fingerprint, DNA swab immigrant detainees to help ICE\nFlorida National Guard personnel will replace 200 Marines deployed in July for \"administrative, clerical and logistics\" duties at ICE facilities.\n- 1,700 National Guard troops will assist ICE with processing detainees in over a dozen states.\n- Guard duties include DNA swabbing, fingerprinting, and transporting individuals.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 National Guard troops deploying to help immigration enforcement agents in more than a dozen red states will DNA swab, fingerprint and transport detainees as part of a plan greenlit by some Republican governors for 1,700 troops to take over some at ICE offices.\nThe Pentagon announced on July 25 that 1,700 National Guard personnel \u2013 1,200 already deployed plus 500 additional troops \u2013 will work on \"case management, transportation and logistical support, and clerical support for the in- and out-processing\" of ICE arrests.\nThe duties of some will also include taking DNA swabs, photographs and fingerprints of people held at ICE facilities, according to a defense official speaking on condition of anonymity.\nGuard troops have already started to arrive at ICE offices.\nIn Florida, 25 of the 200 National Guard personnel that will \"backfill\" nine ICE offices across the state arrived on Aug. 5, according to William Manley, a spokesperson for the Florida National Guard.\n\"We anticipate that our Guardsmen will be performing administrative/clerical tasks, fingerprinting, DNA swabbing, photography and transportation support,\" Manley said.\nThe Florida National Guard personnel will replace 200 Marines deployed in early July to take on \"administrative, clerical and logistics\" duties at the state's ICE facilities, according to a statement from U.S. Northern Command.\nNational Guard troops could take on similar roles at ICE offices in 20 additional states with Republican governors, including Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, according to Maj. Micah Maxwell, a National Guard Bureau spokesperson.\nSouth Carolina has received a request for 40 troops, and Louisiana for 70 troops, according to spokespeople for those state's National Guard bureaus.\nThe Trump administration deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines to quell protests in Los Angeles over widespread immigration raids. The majority \u2013 more than 3,000 \u2013 have been recalled.\nTroops tapped by red state governors to backfill ICE offices\nUnlike those troops, the Guardsmen now tapped to help with ICE arrests will be deployed on the orders of the two dozen states' Republican governors. That means they are not subject to legal prohibitions on federal troops performing law enforcement functions.\nTapping the troops to play an integrated role in processing ICE arrests is still cause for concern, said Joseph Nunn, counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program.\n\"If you're deploying the military domestically to assist with immigration enforcement, you are pulling personnel resources and attention away from the military's core national security responsibilities,\" Nunn said. That includes the Guard's \"traditional\" responsibilities, like disaster relief and response, he added.\nIntegrating troops into internal law enforcement operations farther from the border risks making them a regular \"presence in ICE offices ... across the country,\" he said.\nIt opens up the possibility of \"the military's seemingly permanent presence at the U.S.-Mexico border ... moving into the interior of the country,\" he said."

      "text": "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem defends shooting family dog that was 'untrainable.'\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kristi Noem, a contender to become Republican Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate, defended herself on Friday against Democratic attacks over her account of shooting a dog on her family farm.\nNoem, the governor of South Dakota, describes killing an \"untrainable\" dog called Cricket which she \"hated\" in an upcoming memoir, excerpts of which were first published by The Guardian on Friday. She also said she shot to death a goat.\nNoem said the dog ruined a hunt and later attacked chickens owned by a local family, behaved like a \"trained assassin,\" and was \"dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.\"\n\"I realized I had to put her down,\" Noem writes.\nThe Democratic National Committee seized on the excerpts, calling them \"horrifying\" and \"disturbing\" and tried to make a 2024 election argument about the shooting of the animals.\n\"If you want elected officials who don't brag about brutally killing their pets as part of their self-promotional book tour, then listen to our owners \u2013 and vote Democrat,\" the DNC said in a statement, giving voice to the dogs.\nResponding on X, Noem said, \"We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years.\"\nNoem is on a list of candidates being considered by Trump to be his vice presidential running mate, friends and allies of Trump have told Reuters. Trump faces a general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden on Nov. 5.\nColleen O'Brien, senior director at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), decried Noem's decision to kill the dog.\nShe criticized Noem for allowing \"this rambunctious puppy loose on chickens and then punishing her by deciding to personally blow her brains out rather than attempting to train her or find a more responsible guardian who would provide her with a proper home.\""

  "argos_summary": "The latest episode of 'South Park,' titled 'Got A Nut,' satirizes President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, featuring absurd scenarios like Noem shooting dogs and Trump inviting a character to Mar-a-Lago. This follows a previous episode that depicted Trump in bed with Satan, which drew criticism from the White House, labeling the show as irrelevant. Despite the backlash, 'South Park' has seen a significant ratings boost, marking its most-watched season premiere since 1999.",
