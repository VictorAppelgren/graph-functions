  "content": "Elon Musk just made a move that few would have anticipated, and it has everything to do with China.\n\nTesla\u2019s (TSLA) grip on China, historically its fastest-growing market, is slipping swiftly. For perspective, China-made vehicle deliveries declined 8.4% in July, with Q2 retail volumes tanking roughly 12% year-over-year.\n\nPerhaps even more telling is that Tesla\u2019s EV market share is down to just 7.6%, from its 15% peak during the height of the Covid pandemic in 2020.\n\nNow, in a complete reversal, Musk is joining forces with a powerful domestic AI player he once openly criticized.\n\nTesla\u2019s China sales are still massive, but recent results have shown a clear momentum drag.\n\nIn the first half of 2025, Tesla made $8.61 billion from China, down materially from $9.23 billion in the same period last year.\n\nIn Q2 alone, China contributed $4.31 billion, which made up 19% of Tesla\u2019s total revenue that quarter.\n\nFor perspective, China contributed $20.94 billion of Tesla\u2019s $97.69 billion total sales in 2024 (21.4%), $21.75 billion in 2023 (22.5%), and $18.15 billion in 2022 (22.3%).\n\nOf late, though, the top-line momentum has slowed down considerably, as Tesla has posted year-over-year sales declines in nine of the last 10 months.\n\u2022 Down from 10% in 2024 and well off its 15% peak in 2020\n\nTesla is now focusing its efforts on the swanky new three-row Model Y L, priced at $47,200, potentially regaining some of its lost ground and its ride-hailing segments through the back end of the year.\n\nTesla turns to DeepSeek as Grok hits a wall in China\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Tesla\u2019s China reboot might be powered by DeepSeek, an AI partner Elon Musk once emphatically brushed off.\n\nRemember the WELT summit in February this year, when Musk said while commenting on DeepSeek\u2019s exploits: \u201cBut is it some complete revolution in AI? No, it is not. xAI and others will soon be releasing models that are better than DeepSeek.\u201d\n\nBloomberg reports that Tesla is working closely with Chinese tech groups DeepSeek and ByteDance\u2019s Doubao in enhancing its in-car tools in China.",

      "text": "Though his views encompass home prices and interest rates, it\u2019s more about what\u2019s not happening \u2014 and why \u2014 that silence matters more than ever.\nFor those betting on a potential recovery or waiting for relief, you\u2019ll want to hear what he said and its implications for the next six to 12 months.\nWho is Kevin O\u2019Leary?\nKevin O\u2019Leary, popularly known as \u201cMr. Wonderful,\u201d is far from being just a TV personality.\nThe Canadian investing giant and entrepreneur burst onto the scene when he made his first fortune by co-founding SoftKey, later called The Learning Company. In 1999, he sold that company to entertainment powerhouse Mattel for roughly $4.2 billion.\nToday, according to recent estimates from Fortune, O\u2019Leary\u2019s boasts a net worth that hovers around the $400 million mark.\nMoney aside, his massive influence comes from visibility on TV, online, and in deal flow.\nSince being part of ABC\u2019s long-running \"Shark Tank,\" O\u2019Leary has built a robust seed-to-growth portfolio through O\u2019Leary Ventures.\nThird-party estimates show that he\u2019s thrown in north of $8.5 million across 40 different companies on the show.\nSome of his biggest wins include GrooveBook, which Shutterfly acquired for $14.5 million. Basepaws is another; the pet DNA startup sold to Zoetis in a deal that reportedly delivered a 20x return.\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s influence clearly goes well beyond the boardroom with his \u201ccash flow is king\u201d deal style, helping him strike a chord with his viewers. For perspective, his combined audience is over three million on Instagram and X.\nKevin O\u2019Leary dropped a scathing take on the housing market in an X post on August 21, arguing that the housing market is essentially frozen until rates fall meaningfully.\n\u201cThe housing market is frozen. Prices are up, inventory is down, and with mortgage rates stuck above 7%, both buyers and sellers are paralyzed. Everyone is praying the Fed will cut rates, but let me be clear: It's NOT happening anytime soon.\nHis take is supported by a ton of data showing affordability is still remarkably stretched and activity is mostly subdued.\nMortgage rates are cooling, but not enough to push the needle. The 30-year average sits near 6.58%, which, despite being down from last year\u2019s highs, is still almost double what buyers paid before 2022.\nConsequently, mortgage applications dropped 1.4% last week, and it\u2019s a big part of why June\u2019s median home price hit a record $435,300.\nInventory is crawling higher, too.\nJuly\u2019s for-sale count shot up 24.8% year-over-year, but still remains 13.4% below pre-pandemic levels.\nBuilders are feeling the heat as well, with sentiment just hitting a NAHB 32 (the worst since 2022), and two-thirds are offering incentives to move inventory. Over a third are cutting prices, a stark reality of the current sluggishness in the housing space.\nMoreover, a big part of the market\u2019s lackluster showing is that 81% of mortgage holders have rates under 6%, and over 50% are locked in below 4%.\nThat\u2019s the \u201cgolden handcuffs\u201d effect, where move-up sellers won\u2019t budge, and first-time buyers are compelled to sacrifice space in affording monthly payments.\nO\u2019Leary on tariff fog, rate-cut odds\n\"Powell is not moving until he knows exactly where tariffs land. Right now, CEOs across America have no idea if they are facing a 10% tariff or a 35% tariff, and that kind of uncertainty makes it impossible for the Fed to predict inflation. So the safest move is to sit on their hands and do nothing.\"\nKevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s view is more aligned with reality than markets may want to admit.\nFutures are currently showing rate odds near 80% for September, though Fed officials keep signaling hesitation. Perhaps the most obvious reason for that is tariffs.\nWith new U.S. levies now ranging from 10% to 50%, and some floated as high as 100%, it\u2019s virtually impossible for CFOs to predict pricing power or margin risk. That leaves Jerome Powell behind the 8-ball on inflation forecasts.\nAt Jackson Hole, he\u2019s likely to double down on a \u201cdata-dependent\u201d stance, which aligns with his five straight holds this year.\nPolicymakers are sweating over tariff pass-through effects and whether they could reignite inflation, which makes preemptive cuts risky."
