  "title": "Could DEA Be Next? EPA Firings Spark Questions About DEA's Accountability in MMJ's Marijuana Licensing Delays",
  "description": "",
  "content": "After the EPA dismissed employees who publicly criticized its leadership, attention is turning to the Drug Enforcement Administration's Diversion Control Division, long accused of obstructing FDA-approved cannabis research. With DEA officials Matthew Strait and Thomas Prevoznik retired and attorney Aarathi Haig facing ethical questions, patient advocates warn that new DEA Administrator Terry Cole may soon be forced to take similar disciplinary action against insiders who blocked MMJ BioPharma Cultivation's clinical trials for Huntington's disease and Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC / ACCESS Newswire / August 31, 2025 / The Environmental Protection Agency made headlines this week after firing at least eight employees who signed a dissent letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies under Administrator Lee Zeldin. The move has sent shockwaves across federal agencies and raised a critical question: could the same kind of purge happen at the Drug Enforcement Administration?\n\nThe DEA's Diversion Control Division has already come under intense scrutiny for its handling of medical cannabis licensing, particularly the seven-year stall of MMJ BioPharma Cultivation's application to produce marijuana for FDA-approved clinical trials in Huntington's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. With two longtime officials - Matthew Strait and Thomas Prevoznik - now retired, insiders describe a Division \"in transition.\"\n\nBut one controversial figure remains: DEA attorney Aarathi Haig, who has continued prosecuting MMJ's case despite questions about her bar compliance and eligibility in New Jersey. Patient advocates and legal experts argue that if other agencies are firing employees for dissent, the DEA may eventually be forced to act against officials accused of bias, obstruction, or ethical violations.\n\nUnlike the EPA dissenters, who criticized the agency's direction under Trump, DEA critics point to constitutional violations and bad-faith tactics used to block cannabis research: moving goalposts on \"supply agreements,\" retroactive rulemaking, and excessive security demands costing MMJ hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nMMJ argues that these actions aren't policy disagreements - they are unconstitutional abuses of power. Recent Supreme Court rulings in Axon v. FTC (2023) and SEC v. Jarkesy (2024) have already undermined the DEA's use of in-house Administrative Law Judges, raising the stakes for employees who defend the system.\n\nNew DEA Administrator Terrance \"Terry\" Cole has pledged accountability. But whether he will follow through - and whether firings could come to Diversion Control the way they did at EPA - remains an open question.\n\n\"Justice delayed is justice denied,\" said Duane Boise, CEO of MMJ International Holdings. \"If Administrator Cole wants to restore credibility, he must look hard at the people inside Diversion who've obstructed science for seven years. The EPA has already set the precedent - the DEA could be next.\"\n\nThe issue is larger than internal agency politics. For patients with Huntington's and Multiple Sclerosis, every delay means lost time against diseases that relentlessly progress. For researchers and investors, it means wasted capital and lost opportunity. And for federal agencies, it signals a reckoning: those who obstruct science and defy constitutional precedent may face the same fate as the EPA dissenters - dismissal.",

      "text": "DEA Marijuana Policy Reform - Matthew Strait you're Fired - Highlighted in Heated Oversight Congressional Hearing\n\"This is insanity,\" declares Duane Boise, CEO of MMJ International Holdings, echoing the sentiments of lawmakers and researchers alike. The 2020 House Oversight Committee hearing, and ongoing developments, have laid bare the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) persistent obstruction of legitimate cannabis research, a battle MMJ has been fighting since their 2018 application. Despite bipartisan congressional outrage, as highlighted by Representative Earl \"Buddy\" Carter's scathing critique of the DEA's \"epitome of ineptitude,\" and the agency's own hollow defenses, the DEA, represented by figures like Matthew Strait and Thomas Prevoznik, continues to delay and deny, hindering vital medical advancements. Boise's lawsuit against the DEA underscores the urgent need for reform, as the agency's actions not only impede scientific progress but also deny patients access to potentially life-changing treatments, a situation that demands immediate structural changes in federal cannabis policy.\nWASHINGTON, DC / ACCESS Newswire / March 24, 2025 / The House Oversight Committee hearing on federal marijuana policy in 2020 had brought to light significant bipartisan frustration with the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) handling of cannabis research approvals which still exist to date. The hearing, characterized by vigorous debates and bipartisan criticism, scrutinized the DEA's prolonged delays in processing applications for cannabis research cultivators, notably from entities like MMJ BioPharma Cultivation who applied in 2018.\nIntense Criticism from Lawmakers \"DEA is the Epitome of Ineptitude\"\nDuring the hearings, Rep. Earl \"Buddy\" Carter (R-GA), drawing on his expertise as a pharmacist, vociferously criticized the DEA for its failure to approve new cannabis research cultivators since MMJ's application in 2018. His sentiments were echoed by colleagues from both sides of the aisle who were exasperated by the DEA's inability to adhere to a 2016 promise and a 2022 congressional directive aimed at expediting research applications.\nDEA's Justifications and Rebuttals\nDEA Matthew Strait, backed up by DEA Thomas Prevoznik, who both represent the DEA, continue to defend defend the agency's cautious approach by citing international treaty obligations and the stringent vetting processes necessary to prevent diversion. However, lawmakers challenged these defenses as mere pretexts for the agency's inefficiencies and reluctance to embrace necessary changes in the realm of cannabis policy and medical research not to mention it is state legal in 38 states and not federally regulated."

      "text": "Will DEA Cole Dismantle Marijuana Research Blockade - MMJ Biopharma Will Be His First Test Case\nTerry Cole's future as DEA Administrator depends on recognizing the difference between cartels trafficking illicit fentanyl and MMJ's BioPharma Cultivation developing FDA sanctioned cannabinoid medicines for neurological diseases.\nWASHINGTON, DC, August 5, 2025 (Newswire.com) - When President Donald Trump nominated Terrance C. \"Terry\" Cole to lead the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), it was a clear signal: Cole's primary mission was to dismantle cartels, combat the synthetic opioid crisis, and restore enforcement-first leadership at an agency long mired in political controversy. With a 22-year career at DEA, followed by a successful stint as Virginia's Secretary of Public Safety, Cole embodies the hardened operational mindset of an agency laser-focused on disruption of illicit drug networks.\nBut now, as DEA Administrator, Cole faces a leadership test that law enforcement experience alone cannot solve: Will he continue the agency's institutional stonewalling of legitimate cannabis pharmaceutical research, or will he embrace scientific integrity and public health necessity by facilitating companies like MMJ BioPharma Cultivation in their quest to bring FDA-approved cannabinoid medicines to patients suffering from Huntington's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis?\nCole's Resume: Enforcement Rigor, but Regulatory Inertia?\nTerry Cole's career achievements are unquestionable. He oversaw complex anti-cartel operations in Mexico and Central America, served as DEA's liaison to the National Security Council, and, as Virginia's chief public safety official, led the state to a 44% reduction in overdose deaths in under a year. These are hard data points that speak to Cole's operational success in traditional enforcement.\nHowever, the regulatory side of DEA-particularly its Diversion Control Division-remains deeply flawed. The same bureaucratic apparatus that protected the University of Mississippi's research cannabis monopoly for 50 years has now turned to sabotaging private pharmaceutical developers through endless procedural delays. Cole's predecessors enabled this rot. The question is whether his enforcement first philosophy blinds him to the agency's scientific accountability failures.\nBoise's Resume: A Public Health Mission Obstructed by DEA Old Guard\nOn the other side stands Duane Boise, President & CEO of MMJ International Holdings. A humanitarian entrepreneur with a 30 year track record in healthcare innovation, Boise has achieved milestones that any biotech CEO would envy: FDA Orphan Drug Designation, two active Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, and a DEA-approved Schedule I analytical lab registration.\nBut despite MMJ's regulatory compliance, the DEA has refused to grant a Bulk Manufacturing Registration, effectively halting clinical trials for plant-derived cannabinoid therapies targeting neurological diseases. For over seven years, MMJ's applications have been entangled in a system designed to protect status quo interests, not scientific progress.\nCole's Enforcement Mindset Needs a Public Health Reality Check\nTerry Cole's nomination under Trump was built on a mandate of enforcement and operational disruption. This makes him instinctively cautious-if not resistant-toward cannabis rescheduling debates and broader reform agendas. However, the MMJ BioPharma case is not about recreational legalization or policy rhetoric. It's about pharmaceutical-grade, FDA-regulated medicines for debilitating diseases.\nCole's enforcement instincts must now evolve to recognize a critical distinction:\nIllicit drug cartels trafficking fentanyl are the enemy of public safety.\nFederally compliant pharmaceutical developers like MMJ BioPharma are allies of public health.\nThe same laser-focused leadership that Cole used to dismantle cartel networks must now be directed inward-toward rooting out the institutional sabotage within the DEA's own licensing apparatus.\nWhat Cole Must Do-Now\nFor Cole to succeed as a transformative leader rather than a caretaker of bureaucratic inertia, he must:\nApprove MMJ BioPharma's Bulk Manufacturing Registration immediately.\nDisband the DEA's internal regulatory traps that have strangled cannabis pharmaceutical research under the guise of \"diversion control.\"\nAlign DEA policy with the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act (MCREA), ensuring that qualified applicants receive a fair and timely path to approval.\nHold accountable those within the DEA's licensing division who have weaponized procedural tactics to obstruct science.\nThe Legacy Crossroads\nTerry Cole's enforcement r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has earned him the credibility to confront America's most dangerous narcotics traffickers. But his legacy will not be defined by how many cartel leaders he pursues; it will be judged by whether he had the vision to modernize the DEA into an agency that can differentiate between criminal enterprises and scientific innovation.\nIf Cole ignores the compelling evidence presented by MMJ BioPharma-FDA designations, DEA lab registrations, and clinical urgency-he will perpetuate the very regulatory stagnation that has rendered the DEA's cannabis policy a global embarrassment.\nBut if he acts decisively, Terry Cole has the chance to pivot from enforcement hawk to reformer-a leader who finally corrected the agency's war on science.\nThe choice is his.\nMMJ is represented by attorney Megan Sheehan.\nCONTACT:\nMadison Hisey\nMHisey@mmjih.com\n203-231-8583\nSOURCE: MMJ International Holdings\nSource: MMJ International Holdings"

The question is, why is there no comparable urgency when the failure comes from within the DEA's own ranks? The agency's silence on this matter is not just a public relations problem\u2014it's a breach of public trust.\"\nWASHINGTON, D.C. / ACCESS Newswire / April 9, 2025 / The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the federal agency tasked with enforcing the nation's controlled substances laws, now finds itself in the center of a growing controversy that threatens its credibility. The issue isn't just about the bureaucratic delays that have stalled vital medical marijuana research, it's about the integrity of the individuals charged with upholding the law.\nAarathi Haig, the DEA attorney representing the agency in a high-profile lawsuit filed by MMJ BioPharma Cultivation, is currently listed as ineligible to practice law in New Jersey. Her lapsed status, with continuing legal education (CLE), IOLTA, and mandatory fee obligations, flies in the face of both state and federal ethics requirements. This isn't a clerical error, it's a serious breach of professional conduct that calls into question the agency's oversight and ethical standards.\nAccording to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 530B, federal attorneys are required to abide by the ethical rules of the states in which they are licensed. Haig's inability to maintain good standing with the New Jersey Bar is a direct violation of this statute. The Department of Justice's own Ethics Handbook outlines fundamental principles which are honesty, integrity and adherence to the law which are undermined when an attorney fails to meet even the most basic professional obligations.\nThis is Not a Minor Technicality\nMMJ BioPharma Cultivation, a company seeking to develop cannabis-based pharmaceuticals for Huntington's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis, has waited 7 years for DEA approval to conduct its research. The agency's delays have prompted a federal lawsuit, and now we learn that its legal representative may not even be ethically authorized to appear in court? This development not only bolsters MMJ's case, but paints a troubling picture of selective enforcement and double standards.\nDuane Boise CEO of MMJ International Holdings stated, \"When private citizens or companies fall short of compliance, the DEA acts swiftly and decisively. The question is why is there no comparable urgency when the failure comes from within the DEA's own ranks? The agency's silence on this matter is not just a public relations problem, it's a breach of public trust\".\nThe Public Deserves Answers\nHas the DEA taken disciplinary action? Has Haig been removed from the case? What mechanisms exist within the DEA to ensure their attorneys meet the same standards the agency enforces on others?\nCongress must act. Oversight hearings should be convened, and the DEA should be held accountable not only for its handling of MMJ's application, but for its internal ethical failures. The revelations about Haig, offer a rare glimpse into an agency in need of reform that ensures fairness, transparency and accountability at all levels.\nAt a time when the nation is reconsidering its policy approach to cannabis, we must also reconsider who is enforcing the law, and whether they are living up to the standards they demand of others. When the enforcers themselves become the violators, the law loses its moral authority.\nIT'S TIME TO MAKE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY GREAT AGAIN!!\nMMJ is represented by attorney Megan Sheehan.\nCONTACT:\nMadison Hisey\nmhisey@mmjih.com\n203-231-8583\nSOURCE: MMJ International Holdings\nRelated Documents:\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\nEditor Details\n-\nCompany:\n- ACCESS Newswire\n- Website:"

      "text": "MMJ BioPharma Cultivation: Compliant, Qualified, and Stonewalled\nMMJ BioPharma Cultivation and its affiliated labs have fully complied with the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), following every legal and scientific protocol required to secure a DEA Schedule I Bulk Manufacturer Registration. The company already holds a Schedule I DEA Analytical Lab Registration, a designation that confirms it meets the DEA's highest security, recordkeeping, and compliance standards. MMJ has also secured two Investigational New Drug (IND) applications from the FDA for its cannabis-derived treatments for Multiple Sclerosis and Huntington's disease, as well as Orphan Drug Designation for its Huntington's treatment.\nDespite these credentials, MMJ has been mired in a seven-year delay, with no clear directive or justification from the DEA. The Drug Enforcement's refusal to issue the final cultivation license, while continuing to recognize MMJ's authority to test the same Schedule I substances, exemplifies bureaucratic hypocrisy.\nDEA Thomas Prevoznik's Obstruction: A Pattern of Delay\nAccording to legal filings and internal records, Thomas Prevoznik has played a central role in the obstruction of MMJ's application. His name repeatedly appears in correspondence and administrative decisions that have stalled progress without scientific or legal merit. Critics argue that Prevoznik's actions have crossed the line from cautious regulation into deliberate sabotage of a lawful, FDA-supervised drug development program.\nThese delays have real-world consequences. For patients suffering from progressive, debilitating diseases, time is not a luxury. Every day that MMJ is prevented from cultivating research-grade cannabis is another day patients are denied access to treatments that could alleviate suffering or slow disease progression.\nMMJ Follows Federal Law\nUnlike other conflicts involving state-level cannabis legalization, MMJ's case is squarely within federal jurisdiction. The company has not asked the DEA to bend state-federal boundaries; it has instead followed the Schedule I regulatory pathway exactly as prescribed under federal law. Its facilities are DEA-inspected. Its research is FDA-approved. Its requests are rooted in the very statutes Congress enacted to enable safe, controlled scientific exploration of Schedule I substances.\nAdministrative Law Breakdown: Trump DOJ Withdraws Defense, DEA Pushes Forward\nIn a further twist, the Department of Justice has officially withdrawn its defense of the DEA's current administrative hearing framework for ALJs (Administrative Law Judges), citing constitutional concerns. Yet the DEA, under Thomas Prevoznik's guidance, continues to push forward with administrative proceedings that now lack legal grounding.\nThis divergence between DOJ policy and DEA action reflects a troubling autonomy within the agency, where unelected officials appear to defy executive direction and judicial precedent. It raises the specter of a \"deep state\" dynamic, in which entrenched bureaucrats override the public interest and the democratic process.\nPatients Left Behind: The Human Cost\nThe consequences of DEA obstruction are not theoretical. They are borne by patients-Americans-who live with daily suffering from conditions like Huntington's and MS. These are not recreational users or political activists. They are mothers, fathers, veterans, and children looking for relief, for hope, for life-saving science to move forward.\nCall to Action: Restore Congressional Oversight, Restore Medical Progress\nCongress, the White House, and the American public must now confront this crisis. Immediate steps include:\nCongressional hearings to investigate misconduct and delay within the DEA's Diversion Control Division\nJudicial enforcement of existing law, compelling the DEA to act on legitimate applications\nSuspension of administrative proceedings found to violate constitutional standards\nAccountability for individuals, like Thomas Prevoznik and Matthew Strait whose continued obstruction undermines public trust and patient health\nAmerica cannot afford to let life-saving pharmaceutical innovation be held hostage by bureaucratic inertia. MMJ's case is a litmus test for whether the United States is serious about drug development, regulatory fairness, and scientific progress."

      "text": "From 'Right to Try' to Cannabis: Trump's Next Breakthrough Could Unlock FDA Trials.\n\"President Trump's marijuana decision must go beyond politics-patients suffering from Huntington's disease and Multiple Sclerosis have waited nearly a decade for access to MMJ International Holdings' FDA-approved clinical trials. With capsules manufactured and science in place, all that's missing is the DEA stepping aside.\" stated Duane Boise, CEO MMJ International Holdings.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. / ACCESS Newswire / August 24, 2025 / As national discourse intensifies around President Trump's forthcoming decision on marijuana rescheduling, MMJ International Holdings CEO Duane Boise urges the administration to finally align federal cannabis policy with science, patients, and the FDA drug approval process.\nThe conversation on drug reform is expanding beyond cannabis. Just this month, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) requested a scientific review of psilocybin-a breakthrough for patients and advocates who have fought for decades to access novel therapies. With Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. signaling support for veterans' access to psychedelics, the political and scientific momentum for reform is undeniable.\nFor cannabis, however, progress has been stalled for years. President Biden ordered a review in 2022, HHS recommended Schedule III placement in 2023, yet the DEA has dragged its feet-continuing to block FDA approved clinical trials like those proposed by MMJ International Holdings for Huntington's disease and Multiple Sclerosis.\nPresident Trump has the opportunity to change that. He already championed the Right to Try Act-granting terminally ill patients access to experimental treatments. The same principle should apply to cannabis science. If rescheduling moves forward, the nation must prioritize companies like MMJ International Holdings that have spent years building legitimate, FDA-compliant therapies.\n\"The President's decision can't just be about rescheduling-it must be about patients,\" said Duane Boise, President & CEO of MMJ International Holdings. \"Just as the Right to Try law will break open access to innovative treatments, the marijuana fix should finally clear a path for FDA clinical trials that have been blocked for nearly a decade. MMJ is ready-we have the softgel capsules manufactured, the FDA orphan designations secured, and the science built. All we need is for the DEA to step aside and let the research happen.\"\nUnlike state-legal operators chasing recreational markets, MMJ is pursuing the traditional pharmaceutical pathway. With two Investigational New Drug (IND) applications already filed, the company stands as the only U.S. entity prepared to conduct FDA-sanctioned clinical trials with cannabis-derived medicines.\nAs the nation awaits President Trump's announcement, MMJ International Holdings calls for immediate action:\nReschedule marijuana to Schedule III in line with HHS's recommendation.\nDirect the DEA to stop obstructing federally compliant researchers like MMJ.\nPrioritize FDA pathways over political gamesmanship to deliver real medicines to patients suffering from debilitating diseases.\nAbout MMJ International Holdings\nMMJ International Holdings, through its subsidiaries MMJ BioPharma Cultivation and MMJ BioPharma Labs, is a pioneering U.S.-based pharmaceutical company developing cannabis-derived therapies for Huntington's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. With FDA Orphan Drug Designations, manufactured softgel capsules, and INDs filed, MMJ is positioned to bring the first cannabis-based prescription medicines to market through the FDA approval process.\nMMJ is represented by attorney Megan Sheehan.\nCONTACT:\nMadison Hisey\nMHisey@mmjih.com\n203-231-85832\nSOURCE: MMJ International Holdings\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire"
