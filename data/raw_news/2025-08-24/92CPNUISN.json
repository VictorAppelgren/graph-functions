  "title": "Housing is a human right, not a business activity. It\u2019s time for Australia's laws to reflect that",
  "description": "The housing problem is fixable, but only through systemic change. That\u2019s why I support a proposal to enshrine the right to housing in law",
  "content": "Housing is a human right, but our laws do not reflect that. This failure has helped drive us into a housing disaster, where homes are treated as commodities rather than as the foundation of human dignity.\n\nThe housing system in Australia is failing because it is designed for profit, not people. It encourages us to treat housing as a business activity rather than as a means of meeting fundamental human needs.\n\nI grew up in public housing in Moorabbin in south-east Melbourne in the 1950s and 60s. I do not romanticise that upbringing but it had one thing going for it: access to housing. While the housing commission was a somewhat ominous presence in the background, our large, working-poor family had a home. Low-income families like ours could afford to rent or even buy a basic house (or flat) without experiencing much or any financial stress. Homelessness was very low.\n\nThe system back then more-or-less met the needs of most people for affordable housing. There was a much better balance between demand for and supply of that kind of housing.\n\nIt was not perfect. For example, the supply of housing for the growing population was increased far too much by society sprawling outward rather than inward or upward. The system served First Peoples poorly. It took a long time for women and children fleeing violence in their own home to be given access to emergency housing. But human need, not profit-making, was the central purpose of the system.\n\nThings could not be worse by comparison now. Ordinary working people and families cannot afford to buy or rent a home without parental help (which many don\u2019t have) or going into crushing financial stress.\n\nProof positive of the failure of our housing system are the visibly rising numbers of older women sleeping in their cars; it shocks the conscience of the community that they should be compelled to do so. We should be ashamed of ourselves. I know that I am.\n\nHomelessness is high and not falling. Especially among older women, people living with mental illness and First Peoples. Yet we know from government action during the Covid era that it could be brief, rare and non-recurring.\n\nFor all the justified celebrations of individual initiatives, public and private, we are still barely catching up, and may never get there. The recently announced plan to bring forward the expanded first home buyer deposit scheme might help a bit, but the backlog of unmet need for affordable housing is so vast that even the increased funding and current plans fall well short of what\u2019s required.\n\nWe are facing chronic housing problems decades in the making, systemic in nature and inter-generational in magnitude. The fairness and stability of our society are at risk now and into the future. We need to put something enduring into the system that represents the fundamental needs of people - which is why I am supporting a Victorian Greens private member\u2019s bill to enshrine the human right to housing in law. This will not only help to fix Victoria\u2019s chronic housing problems but will also help to ensure that they do not happen again. And it has national implications.\n\nIt would set a new foundation. It would ensure housing policy is guided by people\u2019s needs, not profit motives, and it would guard against repeating the same mistakes in the future. It would be a gamechanger that would put strong pressure on the system to meet those needs always and for everyone.\n\nIt is going to take some big thinking and brave actions over a long period of time to turn the system around. But it can be done. The housing system is not failing because it is beset by so-called \u201cwicked\u201d public policy problems of the kind that cannot be solved. What is wicked is our failure to fix the problems.\n\nThe system is failing because we as a society are making the wrong kinds of choices, as we have over a long period of time. Recognising and implementing the human right to housing will help us make the right kinds of choices for which we will be a better society.\n\u2022 The Hon Kevin Bell AO KC is a former justice of the supreme court of Victoria, commissioner with the Yoorrook Justice Commission and president of the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal. He is the author of Housing: the Great Australian Right (Monash Publishing, 2024).

      "text": "Blanche is a lot of things: a mother of eight and a grandmother of 10. A viral TikToker. A survivor of family and domestic violence. A former drug user, clean for nearly two years. And she is, for the moment, housed.\nTo the 49-year-old, the two-bedroom community housing she has in Melbourne\u2019s west feels palatial. She previously spent seven months living in a hotel room with her youngest son, then aged nine. Before that, they were wrapped in blankets on the street. They spent four years bouncing around.\n\u201cI thought having a drug addiction was hard but being homeless is harder,\u201d she says.\nDriven by a cost-of-living crisis, exacerbated by growing family violence and priced out of the private rental market, more parents and their children are experiencing homelessness.\nNew data from Launch Housing shows that a lack of stable long-term housing means more families are being housed in emergency accommodation such as hotels, with average stays stretching out to 12 weeks.\nLast year the organisation supported 230 families in hotel rooms, with stays funded by the Victorian government. It\u2019s unclear how many crisis-supported accommodation rooms for families there are in the state \u2013 but Launch runs 11.\nIn the hotel, Blanche and her son lived in one room, sleeping in two beds.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to have any visitors or anything,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly one power point worked at a time, and I got bloody frostbite sores on my toes. We only had one little heater.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have cooking facilities. I bought an air-fryer \u2026 Once a week my son and I went to [fast food restaurant] Lord of the Fries and got nuggets for him.\n\u201cLike any other homeless person, sometimes we choose between eating and our children.\u201d\nSitting in her lounge \u2013 which also doubles as a bedroom for her daughter and her new grandson, just six weeks old \u2013 Blanche is excited.\nShe has taught herself how to use TikTok \u2013 a video of her as an AI mermaid has blown up, hitting more than 30,000 views. After escaping family violence, she never had an ID in her life \u2013 until last year. As a young girl she was a ward of the state. She had her first child at 15 after she was abused. She doesn\u2019t know how to use a computer. Despite where she\u2019s been and what she\u2019s experienced, she laughs easily.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nThroughout their motel stay, her son was going to school, but living there followed him into the classroom.\n\u201cHe suffered at school,\u201d she says. \u201cKids are arseholes to homeless children and his teachers would ask him questions like, \u2018Do you sleep with your mother?\u2019 He didn\u2019t have friends.\n\u201cAnd because I have no teeth, I got judged. It was very hard to get a job.\u201d\nFor some of the stay, Blanche did not have government help to pay the rent, so she worked as a cleaner at the motel. For every two hours she cleaned she would get a $50 discount.\nLaunch\u2019s acting group manager for families and new beginnings, Angela Zheng, says fewer than 1% of private rentals are available for families on income support.\n\u201cThere is also not enough housing out there,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of community housing, and there are limited options for crisis-supported accommodation.\n\u201cSo the demand is just growing.\u201d\nThe homelessness support system was set up when single male clients were the main group of people requiring support, which is no longer the case, Zheng says.\nLast year more than 60% of adult homelessness clients across Australia were women, and more than 75,000 were children.\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling for more crisis-supported accommodation,\u201d Zheng says. \u201cThat means there is support on site. It\u2019s often co-located with children\u2019s programs, with government services, so it\u2019s a kind of a hub that families can link in with.\u201d\nThe Victorian Department of Housing, Homelessness and Fairness spent more than $14m in 2024\u201325 to place people in emergency accommodation.\n\u201cPeople are doing it tough right across the country, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in the support services that help Victorians sleeping rough not just find temporary accommodation but stay in safe and secure long-term housing,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said, adding: \u201cEach year we invest more than $300 million into specialist homelessness services every year, to assist around 100,000 Victorians who are at risk of or experiencing homelessness.\u201d\n\u2018My son is traumatised\u2019\nTyrone is the father of five children. In 2023 he and his wife spent almost three months living in two studio apartments side by side. Their youngest was four, the oldest 17.\n\u201cOur most difficult task was trying to make meals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had one electric saucepan, a kettle and a rice cooker. Lucky I\u2019m a chef \u2013 I could kind of wing it.\u201d\nOver the course of three months Tyrone watched his kids get more depressed. His wife was home schooling the younger ones but the older ones had nothing to do.\n\u201c[They] just watched TV until early hours in the morning and then slept all day,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I came home from work, we would go across to the park. Just to kick the ball and try and get them outside.\u201d\nThe family is now in a private rental, which Tyrone can just afford on his wage. While they\u2019re all close, he says the hotel stay affected his family.\n\u201cWe were stuck in the same room for so long that we \u2026 started to have a few little arguments, or tiffs. Those kinds of pressures.\u201d\nAfter almost eight months living in the motel, Blanche was connected with Launch Housing\u2019s family accommodation program, which looks at finding long-term options.\n\u201cMy son is traumatised,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the first few months or so, he couldn\u2019t sleep with the door closed; he didn\u2019t close the shower door \u2026 It was hard just to transfer away from me.\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t see him,\u201d she laughs. \u201cHe\u2019s just on his bloody PlayStation.\u201d\nIn her new house, there are bright colours everywhere, with walls covered in tie-dye and Disney characters.\n\u201cBut none of this feels like mine, or ours,\u201d Blanche says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not \u2026 We\u2019re still living on the edge.\u201d\nShe and her family have fought \u2013 to get clean, for this roof over their heads. She says she didn\u2019t ask to be homeless or to be hit by her partner.\nShe has been living in the shallow end of Australia\u2019s housing crisis, and is still seeing the impact of it on her son.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to think of the kids. They\u2019ve really got to think of the kids.\u201d"

      "text": "An engineer who helped build Melbourne\u2019s public housing towers in the 1960s has condemned the Victorian government\u2019s plan to demolish them, saying it is expensive, unnecessary and environmentally irresponsible.\nGerry Noonan, who worked on most of the city\u2019s 44 towers, told a Victorian parliamentary inquiry into their redevelopment they should be refurbished and upgraded instead \u2013 citing the financial cost and carbon impact of demolition and rebuilding.\n\u201cIt would be sinful to knock those buildings down. They\u2019re icons,\u201d he told the inquiry on Wednesday.\nThe government has claimed the towers are outdated, unsafe and energy-inefficient, but Noonan characterised those problems as minor and fixable.\n\u201cI live in a house that was built 155 years ago, as do a lot of people in Melbourne, probably even longer than that. You get the odd problem, but it\u2019s not a big deal, certainly not to knock the whole building down over it,\u201d he said.\nUnder the state government\u2019s plan, announced by the then premier Daniel Andrews in September 2023, all 44 towers will be demolished and redeveloped by 2051, starting with three occupied towers in Flemington and North Melbourne and two unoccupied redbrick towers in Carlton.\nWhile there will be 10% increased social housing across the sites, only the towers in Carlton will return as public housing, thanks to federal funding.\nThe rest will be managed by community housing providers, which advocates have previously warned the inquiry could lead to higher rents and weaker tenant protections.\nMuch of Wednesday\u2019s hearing was focused on the condition of the towers, with the minister overseeing the redevelopment, Harriet Shing, telling the inquiry despite spending $110m on maintenance each year, the government was \u201cswimming against a very strong current of deterioration\u201d.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that the housing that we are providing for people is not degraded to the point where we have to act with undue haste in a way that doesn\u2019t give people choices, because we left it for too long,\u201d Shing said.\nShe described the redevelopment as a \u201cvery staged, very careful and considered process\u201d that will take place over 30 years. She said so far, 88% of residents in the first stage had agreed to relocate.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nPeta McCammon, the department\u2019s secretary, said many towers had failed key standards including accessibility, sustainability, ventilation, noise and private open space. She said they would be unsafe in the event of fire or earthquake.\nWhile she conceded some issues could be fixed, she said the cost would \u201cfar exceed the benefit\u201d and residents would still need to relocate.\nThe department\u2019s presentation said pipe walls in some larger towers had eroded from 2mm to as thin as 0.2mm, with 52 temporary patches applied in just the past three months.\nAbout 3,000 units were estimated to be at risk due to failing sewer stacks, with Martin McCurry, the asset manager at Homes Victoria, telling the inquiry about 20km of sewers \u201cneed to be replaced\u201d.\nHe also stressed another major concern was concrete spalling, which occurs when concrete surfaces start to break away. McCurry said this can become \u201cconcrete cancer\u201d, which causes the corrosion of the steel reinforcement and weakens the structural integrity of the building.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a structure which has durability issues, then is it prudent to continue, invest in a structure that has got a remaining life of a minimum number of years?\u201d he asked.\nBut Noonan described \u201cconcrete cancer\u201d as a \u201cpiece of cake\u201d to repair. He also rejected the claim that modern amenities, such as air conditioning, were required in all units.\n\u201cIn Melbourne, you get 10 hot days a year, for God\u2019s sake. You don\u2019t need air conditioning,\u201d he said.\nNoonan also pointed to a report by architecture firm of OFFICE, which released a proposal last year to retain and upgrade the Flemington estate and build five new mid-rises on existing car parks, saving the government $364m.\nSimon Newport from Homes Victoria, however, said the report failed to take into account the need to relocate residents during works.\nNewport confirmed condition reports and cost-benefit analyses had been completed but he could not provide them to the committee, as the government had asserted executive privilege over the documents.\nThe inquiry heard that government has made public just 12 of 146 documents, despite the Greens\u2019 attempt to compel their publication through the parliament."

      "text": "PM to seek meeting with Trump as \u2018summit season\u2019 approaches\nAnthony Albanese and Clare O\u2019Neil have taken a venture out to the Canberra \u2018burbs this morning, to spruik the 5% deposit scheme.\nBut the question on everybody\u2019s lips (and by everybody I mean journalists, the parliament and people interested in international affairs) is when Anthony Albanese is going to meet face-to-face with Donald Trump.\nThe Coalition has been critical of Albanese for not having secured a meeting \u2013 particularly when the Aukus pact and tariffs are on the line.\nAlbanese tells the press conference that summit season is coming, and there will be opportunities for a sit-down.\n[There are] a number of events over the coming months, we\u2019re about to enter summit season, and I look forward to discussions continuing face to face, as they have been constructive when I\u2019ve had discussions with President Trump up to now.\nBragg says Labor underwriting 'extremely wealthy' with first home buyer scheme\nThe Coalition isn\u2019t a fan of the government\u2019s 5% deposit scheme, and Andrew Bragg, the opposition housing spokesperson, says it\u2019s going to turn the government into a major property developer.\nSpeaking to RN Breakfast, Bragg says the scheme shouldn\u2019t be a free-for-all:\nThis is an uncapped scheme which is available to billionaires or the children of billionaires if they want to use a government program. I think we\u2019re getting to a point where Australia is becoming a ridiculous nation where the taxpayer is underwriting mortgage insurance schemes for extremely wealthy people.\nOn pausing changes to the construction code, and streamlining environmental approvals for housing, Bragg says both were Coalition policies.\nHe says the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act has been \u201cvery anti housing development\u201d\nJust because a bird flew over a housing lot in 1971 shouldn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have houses built today. And that\u2019s frankly what\u2019s happening now.\nPacific nations will \u2018make their own decisions\u2019 on recognising Palestinian statehood, PM says\nAlbanese says the government will continue pushing for a two-state solution, as Israel pushes ahead with its military campaign in Gaza.\nSara asks whether there\u2019s more the government can do to help stop the conflict. Albanese says Labor has advocated \u201cdirectly to the Israeli government, but also through our vote in international forums\u201d to get aid into Gaza, advocate for a ceasefire, and get the hostages released.\nBut what about other nations across the Pacific region?\nWe know New Zealand and several other Pacific nations have so far not joined Australia and other nations including France and the UK in recognising Palestinian statehood.\nAlbanese won\u2019t bite when asked whether Australia has raised Palestinian recognition to those other nations.\nThey\u2019re sovereign states, and I welcome their sovereignty \u2026 and they\u2019ll make their own decisions. Australia will make our decisions without concern for anything other than our national interest and for doing the right thing.\nIsrael\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, who has been a vocal critic of Australia, will soon be visiting the Pacific region \u2013 which you can read more about here:\nRoundtable about \u2018future issues\u2019 while government focused on delivering election promises, Albanese says\nMoving on to the productivity roundtable from last week, the question goes to how much appetite Labor has for reform that it didn\u2019t take to the last election.\nIt\u2019s a big question in the political sphere at the moment \u2013 whether a party\u2019s mandate is just for what it promises at an election, or goes much further.\nLabor has seemed pretty unwilling to introduce tax policy above the changes to superannuation tax concessions. Albanese says:\nWell, the economic roundtable wasn\u2019t about just this year or this term, it was about future issues, enabling them to be raised in a way that wasn\u2019t playing the old rule-in, rule-out game. What we are focused on, in the immediate sense, is the reforms that we took to the election.\nSara asks the PM about a warning from the Grattan Institute CEO \u2013 who was at the roundtable \u2013 saying Australians will have to expect lower service delivery from the government if taxes aren\u2019t raised. Albanese accuses her of \u201cacademic\u201d speak.\nAcademics talk in the academic world. What I do is live in the real world, and in the real world my government\u2019s focused on delivering for people.\nRN Breakfast\u2019s Sally Sara points out that the Coalition had its own policy to pause the national construction code, which it announced during the election, and which Labor had criticised.\nSo what\u2019s different now?\nAlbanese says Labor\u2019s plan is to pause changes to the code until mid-2029, rather than the Coalition\u2019s plan which would have been a pause for up to 10 years.\nThey had a plan that was for longer, but at the same time, they were slashing support for housing.\nBringing forward expanded first home buyer deposit scheme will make an 'enormous difference', Albanese says\nAnthony Albanese says bringing the 5% deposit expansion forward by three months will make an \u201cenormous\u201d difference.\nTo quickly recap \u2013 the expansion removes the income caps, and means any first home buyer can access the scheme. It also increases the house price cap across the country (because we know how quickly those house price are rising).\nOn ABC\u2019s RN Breakfast, Albanese\u2019s running through the numbers, and the talking points. He says those using the scheme should avoid about $1.5bn in potential mortgage insurance costs over the next year.\nI think this will make an enormous difference, together with the announcements that we\u2019ve made on the weekend of pausing the National Construction Code for four years, more prefabricated housing, and the fast tracking of some 26,000 homes that have been stuck in the approvals process.\nNimby v Yimby debate over Woollahra station development\nIn the leafy suburbs of Woollahra in Sydney\u2019s east (one of the most expensive suburbs in the country) \u2013 the housing debate is in full force.\nThe NSW government is looking at reviving the old unfinished Woollahra train station, which would open up higher density housing around it. Everyone\u2019s weighing in this morning.\nClare O\u2019Neil credits the premier, Chris Minns, for \u201cstepping up\u201d and showing some \u201cmettle\u201d against the nimbys (\u201cnot in my back yard\u201d advocates).\nPoliticians in this country have to show some mettle on this one. This [Woollahra] is 8km from the city, it\u2019s fantastically connected through public transport, it\u2019s a place where lots of young people are going to want to live, and this is going to give them that opportunity.\nAsked whether the community should just \u201csuck it up\u201d, O\u2019Neil says she wouldn\u2019t be quite so rude as to say it in that way, but essentially \u2026 yes they do.\nOver on Sunrise, frontbencher Tanya Plibersek and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce were tussling on the issue. Plibersek also welcomed the move by the Minns government.\nYou have to make sure that every part of a capital city is contributing to those housing targets. There is no free pass for some suburbs like Woollahra.\nJoyce isn\u2019t quite so enthusiastic, and accuses Plibersek of supporting the apartment constituents with all \u201cthe new shade they\u2019re about to get\u201d.\nRead more on Sydney\u2019s density battle in Daisy DumasandAnne Davies\u2019 story from the weekend:\nPausing national construction code will not mean increase in building defects, housing minister says\nClare O\u2019Neil, the housing minister, is doing the media rounds this morning \u2013 touching down at ABC News Breakfast to promote the 5% deposit scheme.\nBut affordability is also linked to supply \u2013 another issue the government has to deal with.\nThe government has promised to build 1.2m homes over five years to June 2029, a target they\u2019re currently behind on. They\u2019re hoping announcements over the weekend to pause changes to the national construction code \u2013 cutting red tape \u2013 and reducing times for environmental approvals for housing will improve the trajectory. O\u2019Neil said:\nWe committed to roll out 5% deposits to every single first home buyer in the country, we would do that on 1 January, but we can help people faster than that, so we\u2019re bringing it forward to 1 October. This will help tens of thousands of more young people in the market every year.\nAsked whether pausing the code will see an increase in building defects, O\u2019Neil says the government would \u201cnever allow that to happen\u201d.\nWhat we\u2019ve done on the construction code is say safety defects or issues that will cost consumers will be fixed. We\u2019re freezing the code just for non-essential changes. If we find a safety problem in our building approach, we would not hesitate to fix that.\nLabor brings forward 5% deposit scheme for first home buyers to 1 October\nThe 5% deposit scheme, where first home buyers can access a home with a smaller deposit guaranteed by the government, was a Labor election promise.\nCurrently, only a limited number of people are able to access the scheme, which is income tested. From 1 October, it\u2019ll be accessible for all first home buyers \u2013 but only up to certain house price caps (so you can\u2019t bid for a $2m Sydney house under the scheme).\nIn Sydney, that price cap is $1.5m, in Melbourne it\u2019s $950,000 while in Brisbane it\u2019s $1m.\nThe expanded access was due to come into effect on 1 January next year \u2013 but it\u2019s been brought forward slightly.\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese will be spruiking it to the media a bit later this morning.\nKrishani Dhanji here with you for the busy sitting week ahead.\nAfter a week of the government\u2019s economic roundtable, I\u2019m sure politicians will be at their most productive today \u2026 but then again, perhaps not.\nFirst up on the agenda in the House of Representatives today will be debating Barnaby Joyce\u2019s bill to end net zero \u2013 which we know won\u2019t get anywhere, but which Labor is using to split the Coalition (you can read a bit more on that here).\nBut in the wake of that roundtable, Labor has made a few housing announcements over the weekend, including a pause to the national construction code, and a start date for the expanded access to 5% deposits for first home buyers from 1 October (more details on that shortly).\nI\u2019ve got a large coffee, I hope you\u2019ve got some caffeine too \u2013 let\u2019s get this ball rolling.\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

  "argos_summary": "Australia\u2019s housing system is failing because it prioritises profit over people, leading to rising homelessness, especially among older women, children, and First Peoples, and a chronic shortage of affordable homes. The article argues that enshrining a human right to housing in law\u2014supported by a Victorian Greens bill\u2014could redirect policy toward meeting basic needs and prevent future crises. It also highlights government plans to demolish historic public housing towers, the need for more crisis\u2011supported accommodation, and political debates over housing reforms such as the expanded 5% deposit scheme and construction code changes.",
