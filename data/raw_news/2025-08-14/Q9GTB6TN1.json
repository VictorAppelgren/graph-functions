  "summary": "Wall Street's main indexes ended flat on Thursday, with the S&P 500 reaching its third consecutive record high. This follows a report from the Labor Department showing producer price inflation, which increased the most in three years, which dampened expectations of interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager with FolioBeyond, attributed the increase in prices to President Donald Trump's trade policies. Other notable stocks included Deere, which saw its shares fall nearly seven% after reporting a lower quarterly profit and a decrease in its annual forecast.",

      "text": "In this video:\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) and other crypto-related stocks dropped after a hot inflation report. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferr\u00e9 discusses bitcoin's retreat, ethereum's (ETH-USD) momentum, Bullish's (BLSH) initial public offering (IPO) surge, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's stance on bitcoin reserves.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\nAnd Bitcoin sinking and following a hotter than expected inflation print at the same time. The interest in digital assets we know not subsiding. Senior markets reporter Nest Fere joining us now and Nest, catch us up on the latest.\nYeah, Josh, we did see the crypto market today roll over after that hotter than expected PPI print. But I do want to know to bullish which went public yesterday. We saw that stock today up 6%. It was up as much as 10% during the session on its second day of trading. Remember that this stock had opened at $70 a share. In fact, also it the IPO, they priced their IPO at $37 a share. So quite a move that we have seen and look, this also highlights the sort of enthusiasm regarding anything to do with crypto, and especially because this is a crypto trading platform that is geared towards institutional clients. And anything really that has to do as well with institutional adoption that there's a lot of bullishness around that because that's where the street is seeing a lot of runway so to speak, because of more growth and adoption within that space. I do want to note what we saw today with Bitcoin, which was it's it was down more than 3% after hitting all-time highs last night above 123,500, and right now it's hovering just below 18 118,000 per token. We saw the same type of movement with Ether also. Ethereum was up at near highs and now it's down more than three and a half percent. But look, making no mistake that these tokens have had quite the rally this year. They were expecting or investors were expecting looser monetary policy. So so they were really kind of in lock step with the markets as well. And you have also had regulatory tailwinds. I mean, you've had the Genius Act, you've had the a Trump initiative for 401Ks. You've had the SEC crypto project. So there's so many tailwinds regulatory wise for this industry. I do want to point out where what some observers were noting today, which were some comments that Treasury Secretary Scott Beson said this morning during an interview with Fox Business, and he was talking about the Bitcoin reserve, and he was saying that the government won't be buying tokens for their reserve. They will be building up the reserve through confiscated assets, but he also said that they won't be selling anymore Bitcoin. He said that right now where the prices stand that the Bitcoin that they hold is anywhere between 15,000 or 20 excuse me, 15 billion or $20 billion dollars, Josh.\nThank you, Nest. Appreciate it."

      "text": "In this video:\nThe major indexes (^DJI, ^GSPC, ^IXIC) closed near the flatline on Thursday. Stocks spent most of the trading day in the red following a hotter-than-expected PPI print, but traders are still betting the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal shares her takeaways from the trading day including the crypto rally taking a breather and a check in on market breadth.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend.\nThe market rallying stalling after new data showing wholesale prices rising higher than expected in July. For that and other trading day takeaways. Let's bring in our Yahoo Finance senior reporter, Ali Canal. Ali\nYeah, but despite that PPI print, we basically saw markets close flat, the S&P closing slightly above the flat line. That means we have a new record high. So in a lot of ways it feels like markets are digesting this news and basically accepting the fact that in the near term, we're going to be seeing some increased inflation. However, the why is very important. So we did see producer prices hit a three-year high, coming in way above expectations. But we did see services, those components rising for PPI. This is similar to what we saw with the CPI print the other day. And that's a problem for the Fed, because even if they look through tariffs as a one-time price increase for goods, if services is rising where predominantly services oriented economy, that means something else is happening under the hood. So that is what economists have been talking about today and that's really the main pain point looking ahead. Still, markets continue to expect the Fed to cut interest rates here just around 90%. Didn't change all that much, maybe a tiny bit less conviction, but overall, there seems to be this expectation that come September, we are going to get an interest rate cut. The general consensus seems to be if we do see a rate cut, it's going to be 25 basis points, not a jumbo 50 like we saw last year, and the market environment is a bit different now too, right? I mean, interest rates are 100 basis points lower this time around than they were last year. We still have that weakening labor market, but the immigration controls, that's something that the Fed is going to have to take into account as well when we look at that unemployment rate.\nYeah, so basically, I mean, markets looked at the CPI print, the PPI print, and said, okay, there's nothing here that derails that cut that they bet is coming next month.\nRight. And it'll be interesting to see if we don't see the Fed cut and we've been having, you know, different opinions there from actual Fed officials. They've been coming out and speaking, and not everyone is convinced that they need a cut right now.\nIt is interesting your point, you think somebody would be leaning harder into the cut than they sound like they are.\nYeah, they've really much seem to be on the fence here. So that's something that I'm going to be focused on. We have Jackson Hole next week. Jerome Powell's been very good at telegraphing where he thinks the Fed is going to go. So I could see maybe these rate cut odds changing. But from there, I also want to take a look at crypto, because we know that crypto has been just a big outperformer this year. But today, we saw basically all of the tokens take a leg lower here. Bitcoin down 4%. Same with Ethereum. Now I will say this comes after Bitcoin hit an all-time high really early this morning. Maybe it's some profit taking. Maybe it's the fact that we were a little\nBest made some headlines too.\nYeah, maybe a little more risk off in markets overall as well. But still, if you take a look year to date, Bitcoin prices have just been on an absolute tear. And this comes as the administration has really embraced crypto at large. And it's not just retail enthusiasm, it's the institution side as well. And we've seen really successful IPOs with stable coins, really any company that touches crypto touches tokenization. They've done really well. Bullish too, it's a crypto exchange owner. I believe that stock closed up around 9% today after that successful IPO. So overall, even though the rally fizzled a little bit today, I think there's still a lot of tailwinds.\nTrump and that friendlier regulatory backdrop that that's not hurting either, right?\nRight, exactly. And then finally, let's take a check on market breadth. So this is something that we're continuing to watch as we really monitor this market rally. And yesterday we saw small caps rise about 2%. That's the Russell 2000 index. This was the highest level that we've seen in about six months here. And if you take a look at it year to date, you can see this steady rise up. Now today, the equal weighted S&P 500 underperformed the benchmark S&P. So this shows us that most of the smaller companies, they weren't doing too well today. We've really saw those large cap companies leading the way higher here. But overall, it's that's starting to narrow. We are starting to see more broad participation, and that is really critical when we talk about the sustainability of this rally, because you don't want a market that is really top heavy and just concentrated in those top seven names. You really want a lot more dispersion there. And we have been seeing that over the past several months and you can see here year to date we're up around 6% for the equal weight.\nYeah, we had Caleb Silver on the show to ask him, what are the vibes like over investor PD? Strong, he said, and that helps.\nA lot of optimism.\nThank you. Thank you, Ali."

Revenue was just above expectations, $7.3 billion versus an expected $7.21 billion. However, the Q4 outlook fell short of what Wall Street was expecting. CEO Gary Dickerson saying in the release that \u201cWe are currently operating in a dynamic macroeconomic and policy environment, which is creating increased uncertainty and lower visibility in the near term, including for our China business.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\nApplied Materials third quarter results, they are just now crossing the wire, shares you can see, they're falling fast. Let's get you the numbers. Applied Materials, Q3 adjusted EPS 248. That's versus consensus of 236. So you got a bottom line beat. Let's look at net sales, 7.3 billion. Street was at 7.21 billion, so that's a beat as well. Now though, let's turn to the forecast. Q4 net sales, they're calling for between 6.2 and 7.2 billion. Consensus was at 7.32 billion, and that, Caleb, explains why we see the stock down a sharp 11% in the after hours.\nYeah, you miss in this market, your stocks going to get punished. We've seen the misses get punished a lot more than those that are exceeding guidance. And in this sector right now, in the chip sector, whether you're an applied materials or an AMD or an Nvidia, you cannot miss your numbers and you can't guide lower because the investors are going to punish you for it.\nUh, a couple quick questions I I'd have on the call. One is key question would be China, just the back and forth there with trade policy. I'm very curious how executives talk about that on the call, Caleb. And then in terms of demand, I want to hear just where the strength is. Is it the machines that are making hey the the the fancy high-end AI processors we talks processors we talk so much about, or is it is it more auto industrial? Be interested to hear their talk on that as well.\nYeah, they're heavy in that part of the market versus the high flying, high gross margin part of the market. That said, um, they are in the ecosystem right now. So demand is important. You also haven't heard their name mentioned in White House conversations, whether it's being able to do deals with China and give the US a 15% kicker. They're just not involved in the conversation. Right now it's about proximity to power for every company, basically, but especially for the chip makers because chips are the currency of the 21st century.\nBy the way, while I have you, as we're talking chips, what did you make about the uh the export tax for Nvidia and AMD, 15%?\nUh I think it's a very slippery slope uh to be able to do this.\nYeah. Also because because you feel like who's next there?\nWho's next? But also, we're doing business with somebody who we've considered a national security adversary and allowing that chip making and that commerce to happen between borders as long as the US gets a little tariff on that, a little toll on that. I don't know if that's great practice. That said, that might be what it takes to be able to do business in the 21st century with this administration.\nAMD down 11% here. We'll see how the call shakes up."
