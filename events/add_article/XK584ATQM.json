      "summary": "U.S. banks are challenging the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) open banking rule in court, claiming it unlawfully mandates data sharing with commercial third parties and imposes unrecoverable compliance costs. The lawsuit argues that the CFPB's framework is arbitrary and exceeds its statutory authority, particularly regarding fee prohibitions for data access. As the CFPB plans to revise the rule, banks are concerned about the financial implications of preparing for a regulation that may soon be vacated or significantly altered.",
