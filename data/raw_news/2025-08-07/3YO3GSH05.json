      "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nPresident Donald Trump is doubling down on \u201cdebanking\u201d \u2014 a once-niche political issue that now appears deeply personal for him.\nWhile Trump\u2019s at times rocky professional history with Wall Street banks is well-documented, he aligned himself Tuesday with many of his MAGA supporters who claim they\u2019ve been shut out from mainstream finance, telling CNBC that \u201cthe banks discriminated against me very badly, and I was very good to the banks.\u201d\nTrump was responding to questions about an executive order he is reportedly preparing to sign that would direct bank regulators to investigate whether any financial institutions might have unfairly rejected customers on political or religious grounds.\nLet\u2019s unpack what debanking is, and why it\u2019s become a go-to complaint for conservative groups, crypto industry advocates and the president.\nWhat is debanking?\nBroadly, debanking is an umbrella term for when a bank turns away a potential customer, which can happen for a ton of reasons. Maybe you\u2019ve got bad credit, say. Or a history of not paying loans. Or associations with criminal enterprises. Or a business model potentially based on selling unregistered securities in a highly volatile and speculative financial ecosystem.\nTo be clear, Americans don\u2019t have a legal right to a bank account, and it\u2019s not unusual for a bank to reject a person or business they see as risky. And it\u2019s not because banks don\u2019t like a little risk when issuing loans \u2013 it\u2019s because they like risk so much, there are now a mountain of laws to protect banks from themselves. After all, we\u2019ve seen how messy it can get when lenders don\u2019t manage their risks effectively. (See: the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank panic, the 2008 financial crisis, the Savings and Loan debacle of the late 80s, et al.)\nWe could debate how well those laws and regulations work, whether they\u2019re too strict or not strict enough, but the point is: Banks can and do reject customers all the time, for better or worse.\nDebanking has long caused problems for undocumented people and poor Americans, who often have to resort to unregulated payday lenders with much higher interest rates to make ends meet.\nBut more recently, the term has been co-opted by conservative groups that see themselves as victims of a left-wing value system that\u2019s taken root across Corporate America.\nSeparately, Silicon Valley crypto boosters were also taking up the debanking narrative, claiming that their firms and employees couldn\u2019t get financing or even open checking accounts because of an alleged effort by Biden-era regulators to shut the industry out of mainstream finance. Crypto investor Nic Carter first pitched the the theory, dubbed \u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0,\u201d in 2023 in response to banking regulators issuing public guidance about the risks of dealing with digital assets.\nAnd while it\u2019s true Biden\u2019s regulators were more hostile to the industry than Trump\u2019s, crypto advocates are less keen to acknowledge the reasons for that regulatory crackdown. In 2022, crypto suffered a near-total collapse when a fringe stablecoin set off a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d that destroyed $2 trillion in market capitalization over a months-long spiral, culminating in the unraveling of trading platform FTX and its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who is now in prison for fraud.\nIt\u2019s not clear how many conservative groups or crypto startups have been shut out from their banks. Often, their claims are delivered in sweeping, unverifiable statements, and banks don\u2019t comment publicly on individual clients.\nLawmakers say there have been more than 8,000 complaints filed in the past three years claiming improper closing of bank accounts, and nearly 4,000 complaints from individuals and groups being unable to open an account.\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, sir\u2019\nStill, Trump, who has added hundreds of millions of dollars to his personal fortune via crypto, is doubling down on these perceived injustices.\nTrump is even inserting himself peronally in the narrative now, accusing JPMorgan Chase of dumping him as a customer following his first term in office.\n\u201cI had JPMorgan Chase. I had hundreds of millions of dollars in cash,\u201d he told CNBC on Tuesday. \u201cAnd they told me, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, sir, we can\u2019t have you. You have 20 days to get out.\u2019\u201d\nTrump said he then called Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan to deposit \u201ca billion dollars.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he said, \u2018We can\u2019t do it. No, we can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d\nA JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment about the particulars of Trump\u2019s allegation, while repeating the bank\u2019s contention that it doesn\u2019t close accounts for \u201cpolitical reasons.\u201d\nBut Bank of America is taking a different strategy. Instead of demurring and defending itself, BofA\u2019s Moynihan \u2014 no stranger to being a public punching bag for the president on debanking \u2014 responded later Tuesday by interpreting Trump\u2019s invective as a rather broad view about regulatory consistency, instead.\n\u201cI think that the president\u2019s on the right issue, which is, we\u2019ve got to stop the regulators behind the scenes whipsawing back and forth and forcing our companies to make decisions which Congress hasn\u2019t passed,\u201d he told CNBC.\nBut whether the buttoned-up or conciliatory responses are the right tack is still an open question. In a country where Trump has used his various grievances to excise concessions from the media, tech, education, food and baseball industries, banking CEOs might just be the latest ones to try to meet his latest demand."

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order aimed at preventing banks from denying services based on customers' political or religious beliefs, addressing concerns raised by conservatives and crypto advocates about 'debanking.' The order will instruct federal regulators to eliminate language that could discourage banks from serving certain clients and to investigate past policies that may have led to politicized debanking. This issue has gained traction among conservative groups who feel marginalized by mainstream finance, while the crypto industry claims to be facing increased scrutiny from regulators.",
