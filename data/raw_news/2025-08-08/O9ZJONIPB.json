  "title": "This Deal Drops the Nintendo Switch OLED to Under $300 at Walmart for a Limited Time",
  "description": "Price increases are hitting the Switch lineup. If you're not upgrading to the Nintendo Switch 2, this offer shaves down the cost for the previous-gen OLED model.",
  "content": "For some gamers, getting the latest and greatest console is a must, and as such, the new Nintendo Switch 2 has been flying off the shelves since its June release. But at $450 -- or $500 for the Mario Kart World bundle -- it's expensive. And now that Nintendo has announced that it's raising original Switch prices due to market conditions, the chances of getting a previous-gen model at a lower cost have decreased significantly.\n\nThe Switch OLED is going up to $400, but right now Walmart has both the red/blue and the white versions of the console for just $299, making this an excellent deal for those not upgrading to the Switch 2.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED is an upgrade over the standard Switch console if you're a fan of handheld gaming thanks to its 7-inch OLED display and doubled 64GB of storage. Additionally, its kickstand and speakers are improved over the standard version, too, and an added Ethernet port to the dock is a welcomed enhancement.\n\nIf you're not overly particular about getting the latest device, you may want to skip the expensive Switch 2 for now and opt for this deal instead. You'll still be able to play some of the best games Nintendo has offered over the last decade and you'll beat the planned price increases due to tariffs.\n\nNintendo is increasing prices on the Switch, so deals are going to be harder to come by. If you've been holding out for a discount amid the excitement over the new Switch 2, this OLED find is your best bet to get yourself this hybrid console at a steal.",

      "text": "Pros\n- Slim design\n- Large 1080p display\n- Notably better graphics\n- Great-feeling magnetic-attaching controllers\nCons\n- microSD Express cards are hard to find right now\n- Battery life is worse than Switch's\n- Still needs more unique exclusives\nHalfway between Newark and San Francisco, I was settled into my economy seat and fully enjoying the first-class gaming ticket that the Nintendo Switch 2 was giving me in-flight. A big 7.9-inch screen, tilted at a perfect angle as I played Mario Kart World's vast tracks using luxurious new controllers with fantastic vibration. Yep, the Switch 2 is great. Except that the battery was already winding down after just an hour and a half of play.\nIn the world of large, powerful gaming handhelds such as the Steam Deck and upcoming ROG Xbox Ally, the Nintendo Switch 2 currently reigns supreme, with some caveats. Eight years after the launch of the original Nintendo Switch, the Switch 2 is clearly a revamp rather than a reinvention.\nNintendo didn't pull any surprises this time, and instead it delivered overdue graphics upgrades and a lot of design improvements into a console that, after a couple of weeks of living with it, has finally shown me enough to give you a verdict. This is a system whose graphics potential, I think, lies ahead, and a system that could be a doorway to a lot more. In a lot of ways it's the hardware I dreamed of when I reviewed the Switch OLED back in 2021. But it has some current drawbacks that could very well make some choose to wait for more games, or perhaps a better Switch model.\nLet's rewind to 2011. The Nintendo DS was one of the most successful game handhelds of all time, and the Nintendo 3DS promised even more: a backward-compatible design, better graphics, an analog stick, a glasses-free 3D screen. And worse battery life. The 3DS battery life didn't catch up to older DS models until years later.\nThe Switch 2 feels like a familiar story in comparison. For all its graphic updates and excellent hardware improvements, its battery life has suffered. Two hours, maybe three, is what you should expect. And you might find that your onboard storage for games fills up fast, too, unless you invest in expensive microSD Express cards that are currently hard to find.\nBut the Switch 2 looks to do a lot more than that. The graphics boosts and its improvements to modular ways to play put it right at the bleeding edge of where other game consoles look to be evolving next. It's a step ahead of where Windows handhelds and Steam Decks are currently at. And the way the hardware works for more current PC and PlayStation/Xbox-level games should open it up to a lot more software in the years to come. I do love what the Switch 2 can do for games and for connecting with friends. And I bet its advantages will grow even more in another year, when there are far more games and people playing on the Switch 2.\nThe Switch 2 was given CNET's Editors' Choice award on June 26, 2025, largely because of its total advantages versus the competition and everything that's included in the box for its price. That being said, I look forward to improvements that can be made in the next few years, too.\nGraphics that beat the Steam Deck\nI was surprised to find that the graphics on the Switch 2 actually look better than on Valve's Steam Deck handheld. I'm not used to Nintendo hardware being at the bleeding edge of tech. It is this time, though.\nEven though the Switch 2 isn't as powerful as larger game consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X, it does deliver the best gaming handheld graphics right now, period. It has a new Nvidia custom processor that, in early ports of games also playable on Steam Deck, shows better-looking images. I still need to do more direct comparisons with other games to check this out further, but Nintendo's already done an impressive job optimizing its own games, as well as the third-party games that are here so far for its hardware. But I'd still love to see more. The 1080p handheld display and consistent docked performance of games that can go up to 4K and run at 120fps have impressed me a lot. The Switch 2 has its limits, for sure, but it definitely feels like a better TV-docked gaming console than the Steam Deck.\nThere are only about a couple of dozen or so games designed for Switch 2 right now, along with a handful of others Nintendo has updated for Switch 2 with a mix of better resolution, graphics and frame rate. I'm impressed with the results, especially the more I play. Splatoon 3 now flies around, silky-smooth and sharp. Both Zelda games don't have any frame rate hiccups at all anymore, and this is the handheld I want to play to get back into Tears of the Kingdom; it feels fantastic now.\nThe Switch 2's hardware feels fantastic\nFrom the new thin and sturdy kickstand to the larger screen, the beefier Joy-Cons, which have notably better haptics and that lovely magnetic detach mechanism, I love just about everything in the Switch 2's design. Nintendo didn't pull any surprises, but it just seems more mature and polished now. When I looked at the OLED Switch and felt it was an overdue update to the Switch, the Switch 2 takes those upgrades a lot further.\nSo, I also love mouse mode. I really wasn't sure about it at first, and Nintendo doesn't have many games that work with the optical mouse function in both Joy-Cons, but boy, does the feature work well. The camera-based tracking reliably functions on every surface I've tried, from tables to sofa arms to my legs.\nSo far, those mouse features are mainly used with Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 launch title that serves as an interactive hardware tutorial and demo/minigame collection, and which should have been included free with the Switch 2 (but isn't). Other upcoming games like Drag x Drive and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond will use mouse mode, and I hope others do too, since it's a lot easier to use than I ever expected.\nA screen that's more than good enough, but could still be better\nAfter weeks of playing on it, my thoughts on the 7.9-inch 1080p display are that it's definitely good, and I'd love to see it in OLED someday. The HDR support, refresh rate and its larger, higher-res viewing area are all upgrades over previous Switch displays, but it's missing that extra bit of high-contrast vividness that OLEDs can have, and as a result the HDR effects don't really pop. The bezel around the Switch 2 screen is also thicker than I'd prefer. The screen could have been a bit bigger, or maybe the Switch 2 made smaller. Compared to the Valve Steam Deck, though, this feels a lot more compact and modern.\nGameChat and Game Share: Evolved ways to play suggest a transformation in the works\nI've been thinking about the name of Nintendo's console: \"Switch.\" It's the modular transformations from tabletop to handheld to TV docked forms, complete with detachable Joy-Con controllers, that have made the Switch stand out from other consoles. That's still the Switch 2's stand-out advantage over handhelds like the Steam Deck, but the Switch 2 reveals some possibilities in new directions.\nGameChat, a built-in audio and video chat function on the Switch 2, launches hangouts with friends on the fly. Testing it out with friends at work, the feature seemed totally fine, even though it's something I might not use much yet. The C button on the right Joy-Con controller launches GameChat, and uses your Switch friend list as contacts you can add to a chat and start a hangout.\nThe Switch 2 has its own noise-canceling microphone that pretty effectively blocks your own console's game sounds and room noise, but the audio quality with friends was sometimes hit or miss. As a built-in chat platform, it's a lot better than the phone app-based chat Nintendo leans on for the Switch. It's limited to up to 12 people with just voice, or four that can share audio and footage of the game they're playing, along with their own face if they have a USB-connected camera plugged in.\nWhile video quality over GameChat varies and is definitely a lower frame rate and lower-res than most standard laptop webcams, it's good enough to feel presence and connection. Also, my own gaming performance didn't suffer despite having GameChat open at the same time.\nGame Share opens up Switch-to-Switch play with only one game in one console, something only a few Switch games can do with Switch 2. It's a promising idea, since it can also mean family members who don't have a Switch 2 could perhaps play along in some games on their own Switch screen, using a form of localized streaming to share the gameplay. Donkey Kong Bananza has this support, but Mario Kart World doesn't. I think it's a fascinating way the Switch 2 could expand this, maybe even to phones or tablets, but it's really unclear how or when it'll be explored further.\nNintendo's also playing with connected cameras this time around, and while it's fun, it's more of a gimmick at the moment. Plugging in a USB camera into the Switch 2 can let you share your face in Game Chat or overlay your face into games that have camera support. Mario Kart World does this, and a summer update to Mario Party Jamboree has a whole new mode with camera-connected games. Nintendo has its own wide-angle camera you can buy ($55) and plug in; certain third-party USB cameras may work too.\nAll of these things, and that new mouse mode, make me wonder how games could expand to add these tools. Big party games like Jackbox, maybe? I sense the flex in the Switch 2's philosophy and design, but these ideas haven't been hammered out yet into games that really make the most of them.\nOne weird wrinkle to Nintendo's game-sharing rules involves Virtual Game Cards, which can let you loan out your digital games to members of your family for two weeks at a time, or transfer use between two Switches with the same Nintendo account. I appreciate the game-loaning feature, but Nintendo previously allowed multiple Switches to play games under one account while on Wi-Fi. That feature's gone now. I still want games to be truly, freely shared across all family members without limits, but this is a start.\nGames are good, but more needed\nI love Mario Kart World, the Switch 2's exclusive launch game. Its 24-player multiplayer is chaotic but becomes essential for making longer rally modes like the elimination-based Knockout Tour feel so special. The open world map for Mario Kart World doesn't have as many secrets as I'd have hoped (though who knows what Nintendo has in store for the future) but the way multicourse races include the path from course to course as part of the challenge adds variety and changes up expectations.\nEven so, you could keep playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on your original Switch and still be perfectly happy. Mario Kart World doesn't have as many tracks yet, but again, who knows what Nintendo's plans are?\nI've been playing through parts of the initial batch of new console and PC game ports like Yakuza 0, Cyberpunk 2077, Split Fiction and Street Fighter 6, and their upgraded graphics, resolutions and frame rates do feel surprising compared to what I'm used to getting on the Switch. They often look like they beat out some of the Steam Deck's handheld gaming performance. But, on TVs, they still look steps behind what a PS5 or Xbox Series X can do. They're very playable, but notably not exactly the same. Still, the Switch 2 is showing how it's, in some ways, nearly there for a lot of games.\nFor a taste of the weird possibilities, Switch 2 Welcome Tour is sort of a preview and interactive behind-the-scenes guide to the Switch 2's hardware benefits. The $10 game should have been free, and yet I've also enjoyed the four-plus hours I've spent in it so far. It's also the only way to show off or check out the mouse functions in a meaningful way right now. I want more experimental, lower-cost, small Nintendo games that will let me play more like this. Drag x Drive looks like one of them -- I played it briefly during a gaming showcase back in April.\nIt's the next wave of games I'm most excited for. The next exclusive, Donkey Kong Bananza, promises to be a 3D Mario-esque adventure. Metroid Prime 4, which will also play on Switch, looks ready to show off Switch 2 graphics really well. The new Pokemon Legends Z-A could be a great showcase, too.\nBut Nintendo still needs new Zeldas, new Marios, and new ideas beyond those to propel the Switch 2 into a position where it could really feel like a must-have. In the meantime I expect to get back into lots of Switch games in my library on the better hardware. For now, it's more of a fantastic Switch upgrade with promises of more in store.\nBattery life is the limiting factor\nYou're sacrificing something with the Switch 2, and that's mainly your battery life. At best, I've gotten around three hours of play on a charge with Switch 2, which is notably less than current Switches and also less than the Steam Deck OLED model.\nMy 12-year-old son's reaction to the whole Switch 2 proposition was telling. He prefers his old durable Switch and its funky mismatched Joy-Cons because he can play longer without needing to charge. Battery life matters for kids, too. So does size. The Switch 2's bigger feel but smaller battery life is a mismatch for families, and it's the main reason to consider waiting this out. Maybe a bigger-battery model emerges next, or perhaps Nintendo improves Switch 2's battery performance with future games.\nNone of that matters if you keep the Switch 2 docked. TV mode is maybe the new Switch's best way to shine, since the console can pull off 4K resolution and smoother 120Hz gaming, although not all games (or TVs) support those formats. The new camera-connected modes expect you to be TV-docked, too (although you could also use the camera in tabletop or handheld modes, if you have a place to rest it). Playing like this, you wouldn't miss out on a thing.\nStill, I'd like to see battery life improve, especially since recharging isn't speedy. It's taken me more than an hour to charge the Switch 2 back to where I'd want it to be. In the meantime, living with a battery pack for long trips might be the solution.\nFor now, it's a sacrifice for better performance, much like that Nintendo 3DS.\nStorage space is a factor, too\nI've gotten frustrated by the Switch 2's already-limiting onboard storage options, too. The console has 256GB of onboard storage, far larger than the 64GB that comes on the Switch. But game download sizes have ballooned, too. Cyberpunk 2077 is around 60GB. Split Fiction is 69GB. Street Fighter 6? 48GB. There are some smaller Switch 2 games, and if you buy game cards with the games actually onboard (versus \"game key cards,\" which only trigger a download), you could save yourself storage space, too. Still, I found myself needing an expansion fast. However, the Switch 2 requires microSD Express cards, a new format that's more expensive and currently really hard to find.\nI bought a 256GB card and filled it fast, and haven't even put many of my original Switch games on it. Sure, I have a lot of Switch games, and many of the classic ones never get above 10GB in size. But if future Switch 2 games continue on this larger file-size path that feels similar to the Steam Deck and Windows handhelds, managing games will be a challenge if you have more than a handful. In a year or so, microSD Express cards should be more plentiful, but at the moment, it's a bottleneck.\nDo you buy it if you have a Switch?\nIf you've never owned a Switch before, the Switch 2 makes great sense as a starting point. Finally, the hardware is upgraded for the future, and almost all existing Switch games play on it. Many of them have AI-upscaled graphics, too, and others are being given Switch 2 boosts, either for free or for an extra fee.\nHowever, if you already have a Switch, it's a toss-up. True, you won't regret how much nicer your games can look here, and the new hardware feels fantastic. But do you want the larger size and the smaller battery life? My kid says he can wait.\nI still think it'll take a good year or so for the Switch 2 to ramp up its games and features and become a true must-have for Switch owners. Or maybe it'll take longer. Nintendo tends to update its handhelds every two years, so maybe 2027 could see a revised Switch 2? Who knows? In the meantime, just know that the Switch 2 keeps the good times rolling and, in most ways, it's a lot better, but paying up for the new games, the console, and new accessories can add up.\nDo you buy it instead of a Steam Deck?\nThe Steam Deck and Switch 2 are very different beasts, with a lot of things increasingly in common. I still admire the Steam Deck OLED's longer battery life, its extra controls like trackpads and analog triggers, and its far more customizable OS that can be hacked to run other apps if you want. Plus, Steam is a treasure trove of so many games that don't even make it to handhelds like the Switch, and PC gamers can take advantage of using their existing libraries.\nThe Switch 2, however, has taken the lead now on impressive hardware. It's slimmer, has a higher-res display, can output 4K and 120Hz to TVs, comes with a dock, has those detachable controllers that can also be mice, and Nintendo does a great job optimizing its games for their consoles, with no signs that'll stop here. It also looks like the Switch 2 will be getting a lot of the Steam Deck-optimized games on Switch 2 over time, since its capabilities are so similar now. Further, the Switch 2 is bound to be a good place to sell indie games to a far larger handheld audience, much like the Switch has been.\nI prefer the Switch 2 just a bit more than the Steam Deck right now, but it's a choice lots of people will debate, especially as more Windows handhelds with better performance start to pop up.\nThe future in familiar form\nI think the Switch 2 will transform over the next few years. Maybe with its already-announced functions, maybe with others. Maybe via games that can finally make the leap. Maybe in other weird Nintendo ways no one can predict.\nAlready, it's building a foundation for some really useful stuff that the original Switch couldn't do, and current Windows gaming handhelds and the Steam Deck can't either.\nYes, it's mostly a better, more expensive Switch right now. But that's also reason enough to take the plunge, even with the battery life and storage concerns. It's not the perfect Switch 2, but it's also the Switch I'm going to use over any other. And, I think, the handheld I'll prefer over any other.\nYou can sit this upgrade out for a while, for sure, and wait for the rest of Nintendo's plans to unfold. I'd even recommend that. But then, yeah, come onboard, because I need more people to GameChat with."

      "text": "Nintendo has been one of the biggest names in gaming for decades, but for the last eight years, the Switch has held an especially strong grip on players, young and old. The standard console, Switch Lite and Switch OLED have blended incredible games you won't find anywhere else with a delightfully portable console format. Altogether, this generation of Nintendo systems sold upward of 143 million units globally, according to company financial data.\nAfter what was considered a failed launch of the Wii U in 2012, the Switch's success is a result of Nintendo's willingness to experiment with and create new experiences from a number of its pedigreed gaming series, including Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Pokemon. Its innovative design allows standard console play to coexist with the motion controls baked into its compact Joy-Con design.\nWith the reveal of the Switch 2 console, the slate of Switch games has become more important than ever before. Backward compatibility will mean you're able to bring your favorite Nintendo games with you onto a new, stronger iteration of the fan-favorite hybrid console. Some of the best Switch games will even be getting free Switch 2 updates or paid Switch 2 edition upgrades.\nIf you're looking for the right game for you ahead of a new console release, CNET curated this list of the best Nintendo Switch games you can buy right now.\nBest Nintendo Switch Games - August 2025\nIn early 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild fundamentally changed the Zelda franchise formula. I'd dabbled in past entries, but Breath of the Wild's expansive open world called to me in a way that no other Zelda game did, featuring puzzles with multiple solutions and encouraging novel approaches to combat encounters. Then Tears of the Kingdom came along in May of 2023 and made Breath of the Wild feel immediately obsolete.\nThe design choices in this game advance everything that made its predecessor special. Among several new ways to interact with the world, the Ultrahand power took over the internet for a hot minute after Tears of the Kingdom dropped, and that's for good reason -- it's not often that someone gets to build a bomber jet in a completely unmodded fantasy RPG.\nDespite inheriting much of the same map from Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom entertainingly remixes the terrain as floating islands dominate the horizon and a new underworld called the Depths add new locations for players to explore. Figuring out how to handle the vertical slices of content can be a headache, and the new powers can be unwieldy, but as soon as you make it over those small barriers to entry, you'll revel in the total player freedom and expansive world in Tears of the Kingdom.\nRelease date: May 12, 2023\nGenre: Open world sandbox adventure with survival elements\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nSwitch 2 features: Paid upgrade pack to improve graphical fidelity and integrate Zelda Notes\nEven if you've never owned a Nintendo console, you've still probably played Mario Kart at some point in your life. It's practically the go-to party game, as pretty much anyone can pick up a controller and jump in. Mario Kart 8 actually originates from the Wii U era, but the game was ported to the Switch in April 2017, with \"Deluxe\" attached to the title and several content expansions released.\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe is one of my favorite entries in the Mario Kart series purely for its selection of 48 different tracks you can play, which is doubled to 96 tracks with added DLC. These extrea tracks come from all over the place, including remastered retro tracks from older Mario Kart titles and some tracks from Mario Kart Tour on mobile.\nI also particularly like the accessibility options that Mario Kart 8 has, especially a smart-steering feature that you can toggle on or off that functions as an assisted steering option keeping your kart from tipping over the edge of the track. This makes it so that pretty much anybody can have a good time racing, ensuring I can finally play Mario Kart with my parents and not have to worry about them constantly falling off the track while we have a good old-fashioned family race.\nRelease date: April 28, 2017\nGenre: High-octane party game\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nIt's hard to believe the original Super Smash Bros. that came out in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 only featured 12 playable characters. That might be a solid roster for another fighting game, but it's almost laughable compared to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which launched in December 2018 with a roster of 76 fighters (expanded to 86 with post-launch DLC).\nOther games have more fighters than Ultimate (looking at you, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero), but none of them pull from such a diverse range of heavy-hitting gaming franchises. Smash has become ubiquitous with pulling in gaming legends, and it's really no surprise why that is: this is a game where you can choose to play as Mario, Sonic, Cloud Strife, Pac Man or Sora. I can annoyingly pester opponents from across the map with Solid Snake's missile launcher in one match and then do the same thing with Richter Belmont's axes and holy water during the next one.\nUltimate isn't a phoned-in IP parade, either. It's a game that proves that Smash Bros. is still the premier platform fighter, with fast-paced movement, frame-perfect parries and killer combos defining high-level gameplay. You don't have to be super skilled to have fun, either -- it's a fantastic party game to boot up with friends. Just turn on item drops or open the World of Light story mode and everyone will have a good time.\nRelease date: Dec. 7, 2018\nGenre: Crossover platform fighter\nDeveloper: Nintendo, Masahiro Sakurai, Sora, Bandai Namco Studios\nReleased in September of 2022, Splatoon 3 is the latest entry in Nintendo's family-friendly third-person shooter franchise. You're a kid, you're a squid and it's up to you to ink the majority of the multiplayer battle arena to win the match.\nSplatoon's third entry includes more customization than ever before, featuring new Inkling and Octoling cosmetics that change in-game abilities and even more weapons. It's a strange sort of power fantasy to ride around blasting globs of ink out of the turrets of the Crab Tank or to jet into the opposing team on the toothy Reefslider, but it's a blast nonetheless.\nIf you don't have an internet connection (or a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online), there's still a single-player campaign for you to play. It's one that will still let you mess around with all of the chaotic weapons from multiplayer game modes as you embark on a covert mission to prevent the final mammals on Earth from destroying all aquatic life.\nThere aren't many shooters on the Switch, but Splatoon 3 is an exception that combines zany, chaotic movement and inventive weaponry with some seriously satisfying gunplay.\nRelease date: Sept. 9, 2022\nGenre: Family-friendly third-person shooter\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nIf you like farming simulators or are simply just looking for a new cozy game filled with pleasant tasks, you have to give Stardew Valley, first released in February of 2016, a try. It's kind of like playing a Harvest Moon or Story of Seasons game but with much more to do and an adorable retro art style. The farmland you start with is inherited from your character's grandfather, which sounds awfully nice of him if it weren't for the trees, boulders and weeds everywhere. It's up to you to clear everything out and build up your own farming empire.\nThis game will have you running around all over the place, making it something of a cozy time management puzzle -- there's always something to do. Between tending to your crops and animals, trips to the store and the mines, fishing, foraging and visiting NPCs, you'll have a pretty packed schedule. The good news is that you can go at your own pace working through the four seasons per in-game year. There technically isn't an end to Stardew Valley, but there are certain crops that you'll want to make sure get grown in certain seasons.\nThere are also some robust crafting features to create tools and machines to automate farm chores (I don't like watering crops, so I'll craft an army of sprinklers) and process crops into more profitable goods. (I fill my sheds with kegs and preserve jars to process fruits into wines and jellies.) In short, Stardew Valley is a great game to build your own little farming world, as busy as you want to make it.\nRelease date: Feb. 26, 2016\nGenre: Harvest Moon-like farming sim\nDeveloper: ConcernedApe\nThe Animal Crossing franchise was a childhood staple, and I have fond memories of rushing off the school bus to grab my Nintendo DS and see what my Animal Crossing Wild World villagers were up to. Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo's most recent Animal Crossing game, brings that childhood nostalgia back full force and is easily the best in the series.\nNew Horizons couldn't have launched at a better time. The game came out in March 2020, during a time when Covid was at its peak. Like many others, I was stuck inside nearly around the clock, and New Horizons provided a cozy way to escape from the global chaos of pandemic lockdowns. You start your game on a deserted island with nothing but a tent, the clothes on your back and a few friendly neighbors (along with a Nook-sized debt to pay off). As you play, you'll invite more NPCs to live on the island, gather materials to construct new buildings and decorate things however you want.\nMuch like older Animal Crossing titles, you'll still be fishing, catching bugs and digging up fossils. New Horizons spices things up by giving you more freedom than ever before to perfect your little island world. This is the only Animal Crossing game that lets you place furniture and objects outside and even (eventually) shape your island's rivers and cliffs to be the way you want. It's been a few years since its peak, New Horizons is still one of the best cozy games on the Switch with an active community (and subreddit) that would still be delighted to visit your digital paradise.\nRelease date: March 20, 2020\nGenre: Village building cozy game\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nNintendo has been rehashing some of the same gimmicks in its Super Mario Bros. games for years, which is fine when they're some of the best platformers, but the repetition gets stale after a while. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, released in October 2023, freshens up the formula and is easily the most fun I've had with a Mario game in a long time. It's a classic 2D Mario platformer that's brimming with creativity.\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder's secret ingredient is transformation. Each level contains what's called a wonder flower, and touching the wonder flower transforms the entire level in a way that you probably aren't expecting. The ground may start to move, enemies might burst out into song or you might even start floating until you reach outer space. Expect a new surprise at every level, especially if you're going in blind (which is what I recommend.)\nI also love the way the game looks, as the colors in Mario Wonder really pop. The color palette for each level feels bright and vibrant, but also darker when it needs to be, like during Bowser or Boo levels. The new animations and voice work for Mario and friends are a welcome addition as well. Like the best Mario games, Wonder executes its plethora of fun ideas so well that players will find joy around every corner.\nRelease date: Oct. 20, 2023\nGenre: Co-op 2D platformer\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nAs the first 3D Mario built for the Switch, Super Mario Odyssey debuted in October 2017 to immense acclaim, with a lot of praise for the new enemy-controlling mechanic courtesy of the Italian plumber's new pal Cappy. Despite initial doubts that the game's central mechanic of using a hat to possess different enemies would be too gimmicky, Super Mario Odyssey stands out as one of the 3D Mario all-time greats.\nAs expected for a Mario game, there's a wealth of worlds to enjoy, which are opened up in new ways when Mario possesses different enemies. One of Odyssey's big strengths is how satisfying it feels to move around each colorful locale. Movement mainstays such as Mario's triple and backward crouch jump return, but now Mario can dive onto Cappy for a massive boost in the air, too. The hat also allows the player to rampage around as a T. rex, surge through a powerline and more, breaking up some of the more intensive platforming sections.\nCompletionists have a lot to chew on as there's also a wealth of content to enjoy, as there are 999 so-called Power Moons to hunt down across the entire game -- some you need to progress to new areas, but most are for the pleasure of finding. Some of these are definitely filler content (119 of these moons are just bought outright with coins), but true collectors will have their hands full with Odyssey for a long time. No matter how much you play, Super Mario Odyssey is not only one of the best platformers on the Switch -- it's one of the best Mario games ever made.\nRelease date: Oct. 27, 2017\nGenre: 3D platforming collectathon\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nSwitch 2 features: Free update to improve playability on the Switch 2.\nIf you're interested in adding a few indie games to your lineup, Spiritfarer, released in August 2020, should be at the top of your list. As the developers describe it, the game is \"a cozy management game about dying.\" You play as the new titular Spritfarer, Stella, in a world where spirits are stuck between the living world and what lies beyond, like a purgatory of sorts. It's Stella's job to fulfill spirits' last requests; when they're ready, you'll take them to the other side. These spirits can be a bit needy at times with onerous requests, but thankfully, you'll have a boat to house them on -- and form your own little post-life community.\nYour boat is almost like a cruise ship for the dead with you as its captain. As you play, you'll make port at various islands and collect resources to build new homes and specialty rooms for the residents of your ship. You might even welcome a new spirit or two aboard your ship when you dock at a new area. Spiritfarer breaks up the afterlife catharsis missions with some casual 2D platforming elements, which keeps things fresh and interesting. Just make sure you're ready for more than a few tearful goodbyes before playing -- don't be surprised if, like me, this game gets you sobbing.\nRelease date: Aug. 18, 2020\nGenre: Cozy resource management sim\nDeveloper: Thunder Lotus Games\nIf you're a fan of the Xenoblade games, then you'll be happy to know that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is one of the best in the series. If you've never played a Xenoblade Chronicles game before but are looking for a narrative-driven JRPG that takes over 60 hours to beat (or double that for completionists), then you'll likely enjoy this game too, even if you don't know anything about the previous games. Don't worry, Xenoblade veterans, you'll enjoy some fun easter eggs and nods to the previous titles.\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 builds on its predecessors with a large open world to explore, refined action-RPG combat mechanics and one of the most compelling narratives I've ever experienced in a JRPG. In a world where a person's life source is literally fueled by taking the lives of others, the game's story takes players through heavier topics like what it really means to be alive, the morality of killing and what happens after death -- suitably weighty and existential for a JRPG. The story is definitely better when experienced blind, so try and avoid spoilers if you can.\nRelease date: July 29, 2022\nGenre: Action-adventure JRPG\nDeveloper: Monolith Soft\nIt's always nice to see Nintendo giving some love to its older franchises, especially those that haven't had a new entry in over a decade. If you're a 3D Metroid fan, picking up Metroid Prime Remastered is a must. The game is a faithful remaster of the original Metroid Prime which originally came out on the GameCube in 2002, bringing the groundbreaking sci-fi adventure shooter on the go in HD.\nThe remaster updates graphics and sound design for the Switch, as well as a remarkable four control modes to choose from: a classic version replicating the original GameCube setup (move with the left stick and hold ZR to look around with the same stick), a dual stick version replicating how most FPS games control today, a Pointer mode that replicates the Wii-and-nunchuck setup to aim with motion controls and a Hybrid that combines classic and motion controls. You're spoiled for choice on how you want to play through the game.\nMost importantly, Metroid Prime itself is a great example of how to transition a treasured 2D game into a 3D space as the first in the series to be designed in three dimensions. The game has a strong emphasis on exploration as you traverse diverse biomes and scan every bit of the world as you face off against various alien creatures. And while I wouldn't say this is a combat-focused game, there are definitely some gunplay and retro shooter elements in here to enjoy that, combined with an all-time score and great bosses, make for a gem of an older game well-polished for today's gamers.\nRelease date: Feb. 8, 2023\nGenre: Sci-fi first-person shooter\nDeveloper: Retro Studios, Nintendo\nSuper Mario 3D World is another game that made its way to the Switch from the Wii U. The main gimmick of the game is in the title: it's a 3D Mario platformer, but it shares beloved elements from its 2D Mario counterparts. You'll still be racing to the flagpole and the levels are still timed, but they're all set in a 3D space. Despite the clock ticking down as you play, there are still plenty of areas to explore and challenge items to collect, including three green stars to collect on each level that you'll need to progress through the game.\nAlong with the re-released Mario 3D World, you'll also get to play Bowser's Fury, a standalone 3D Mario platformer that's exclusive to the Switch. I personally had more fun with Bowser's Fury, which plays more like Super Mario Odyssey with its large open areas full of collectible cat shines. The game itself is pretty short and there are only 100 shines to collect, but it's still tons of fun and feels close enough to an open-world Mario game.\nRelease date: Feb. 12, 2021\nGenre: Linear 3D platformer\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nSwitch 2 features: Free update to improve playability on the Switch 2\nThe aptly named Tetris Effect is the dreamiest iteration of the classic arcade puzzler that I've ever played.\nThis game isn't about being the quickest line cruncher, even though challenge modes and in-game achievements will certainly test the skills of any hardcore Tetris player. Instead, Tetris Effect is a sensory feast -- each level is a themed lightshow (depicting cultural celebrations, natural wildlife and more) with pulsing music to match.\nThere's nothing more satisfying than dropping blocks into place and experiencing the elements of the board flowing in time to your cleared lines. By the time you're making back-to-back Tetrises, the whir of the audiovisual elements make the game feel as though it's coming to life under your control.\nIf calming singleplayer action won't cut it for you, Tetris Effect: Connected adds cooperative and versus multiplayer modes, where teams of three players duke it out with a block-dropping computer -- or another person. Whether you want to relax and enjoy the lights and sounds or ramp up the gameplay speed, Tetris Effect has a game mode tailored to your interests.\nRelease Date: Nov. 10, 2020\nGenre: Classic arcade puzzler with heavy emphasis on audiovisual flow\nDeveloper: Monstars, Resonair\nAs one of the tough pink puff's rare forays away from Planet Popstar, Kirby and the Forgotten Land stands out as a fantastic platformer that also has an incredibly distinct visual identity compared to the rest of the series.\nGone are the pleasant, bucolic Green Greens and the Float Islands; instead, the titular Forgotten Land is a modern world disconcertingly similar to ours, although advanced in its decay. I felt a strange thrill plodding Kirby through concrete jungles, dead malls and sunken construction sites -- places the pink puffball doesn't \"fit in,\" which left me wanting to explore even more of this world.\nThe actual gameplay is standard fare for a mainline Kirby game, though that isn't a ding against it. The platforming is entertaining, with additional obstacles and enemies placed about to account for our hero's ability to float over most gaps. Kirby's copy abilities also return -- my favorite was the Ranger ability, which allows our puffball to tote around an adorably oversized blunderbuss -- and unlocking upgrades for them in the endgame helps balance the odds in some surprisingly difficult boss fights.\nIf you're a massive Kirby fan, fascinated by liminal spaces like the ones featured in the game or just enjoy a fun, family-friendly platformer, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the perfect match for you.\nRelease date: March 25, 2022\nGenre: Atmospheric 3D platformer\nDeveloper: HAL Laboratory\nSwitch 2 features: Paid upgrade pack that includes a brand-new set of levels and additional abilities for Kirby\nI first played Pokemon when Diamond and Pearl came out and they still hold a special place in my heart, but the reimagined generation four games, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, were middling (and fairly disappointing) Switch remakes of their original namesakes. Pokemon Legends: Arceus, on the other hand, was the truly impressive return to Sinnoh I had been waiting for.\nDelving into the Hisui region lets players peek into a formative early time period we've never been able to experience before, where Pokemon are a very real and largely untamed threat. This game was the first time where I was personally attacked by a Pokemon, and it was thrilling. I learned to avoid Alpha Pokemon, steer clear of prowling Ursalunas and avoid antagonizing Kleavors. Legends: Arceus finally created a world where Pokemon ecosystems feel alive.\nLong-term players will have a lot to do outside of completing the Pokedex, with activities ranging from hunting for super rare \"shiny\" versions of their favorite pocket monsters to capturing a fragment of the Pokemon god of creation. This is the only Pokemon game where you can capture this particular titular deity without hacking in a special item -- if you're a hardcore fan, you won't want to miss the chance to adventure alongside Arceus.\nRelease date: Jan. 28, 2022\nGenre: Open-world monster tamer\nDeveloper: Game Freak\nReleased in September 2024, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom finally gave players the chance to do something they hadn't been able to since the first time they journeyed through Hyrule: adventure as Zelda herself. As it turns out, the princess' first solo outing -- where the tables are turned and she has to save the legendary swordsman, Link -- is an impressive action puzzler.\nZelda is able to take on the form of a sword fighter in order to hack and slash her way through enemies, but that isn't the only way Echoes of Wisdom encourages players to engage in combat. Instead, the new Tri Rod tool allows Zelda to make echoes of enemies and objects in order to defeat foes and solve problems, combining the creativity of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom with more old-school Legend of Zelda dungeon design.\nIn that sense, Echoes of Wisdom is a love letter to longtime fans of the series. New mechanics might open dozens of solutions to the game's puzzles, but this is a game interested in returning to the basics of the franchise's formula -- tightly crafted dungeon crawling fun.\nRelease date: Sept. 26, 2024\nGenre: Puzzling dungeon crawler adventure\nDeveloper: Grezzo, Nintendo\nSwitch 2 features: Free update to improve playability on the Switch 2\nThe newest entry into the Mario Party franchise aims to keep your party entertained indefinitely by making sure you never run out of novel diversions. Super Mario Party Jamboree, released in October 2024, features seven playable boards along with more playable characters and minigames (a whopping 112, including both new and fan-favorite romps) than any previous game in the series.\nIf the average game of Mario Party runs a little too long for your tastes, new Pro Rules allow you to tweak the length of player turns and keep the game moving along so you're never out of the action for long. And you're not locked out of Jamboree if you're playing alone: In addition to a strong single player campaign, the game allows you to matchmake with other players if you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.\nSuper Mario Party Jamboree is perhaps the most substantive Mario Party game ever released. There's a lot of content to unlock, both on and off the game boards, which will keep completionists and their friends blasting through the game's multitude of minigames for hours.\nRelease date: Oct. 17, 2024\nGenre: Multiplayer minigame pack\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nSwitch 2 features: Paid upgrade pack that will add new base game minigames, as well as the new Jamboree TV mode, which includes special minigames that utilize the Switch 2 Joy-Cons and camera peripheral\nMost of Samus Aran's modern (read: Wii-era) bounty hunting escapades are found in the 3D first-person Metroid Prime shooters, but Metroid Dread takes the heroine back to her roots in a new side-scrolling adventure. The game is a throwback to classic Metroid design, where players need to find suit upgrades to improve their battle capabilities and unlock new parts of the map. Dread allows players to perform melee attacks and aim freely across the screen, creating a more fluid combat system.\nMetroid Dread also implements design decisions from an unlikely genre: survival horror. Invulnerable robotic stalkers, EMMIs, hunt Samus through levels -- players will need to hide or activate a new camouflage ability until they find a weapon powerful enough to destroy these foes. This twist on the formula ratchets up the tension and makes Metroid Dread feel like an evolution of its predecessors.\nRelease date: Oct. 8, 2021\nGenre: Classic 2D maze action-adventure\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nCaptain Olimar is stranded again, and it's up to the newest member of the Rescue Corps to save him in Pikmin 4. Players command an army of adorable half-plant, half-animal creatures called Pikmin to complete different tasks that bring them closer to their goal. All of the previous specialized Pikmin return, while two new types of the obedient followers add depth to the game. The Glow Pikmin in particular help defend the player character in the new Night Expeditions tower defense game mode.\nA more classical Pikmin experience is available in the Olimar's Shipwreck Tale mode, where players once again step into the shoes of the steadfast space captain. Olimar must collect all 30 pieces of his ship before his life support runs out, using yellow, blue and red Pikmin to overcome a new set of obstacles. Pikmin 4 puts a new spin on a familiar world, creating an adventure that feels alien once again.\nRelease date: July 21, 2023\nGenre: Action-adventure puzzler featuring specialized creature companions\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nNintendo's first Super Mario Maker game made 2D Mario level design quick and easy for any audience. The sequel keeps all the fundamentals intact while adding more content: There are new building blocks, new themes and this time around there's a story mode for solo play. Super Mario 3D World elements were added, retooled in a new 2.5D visual overhaul. Players are also able to increase the level height limit to make vertical levels, as well as invite a co-op partner to build together.\nIf you love classic Mario gameplay but you aren't interested in creating your own levels, don't write off Super Mario Maker 2 just yet. The game features two- to four-player cooperative play and competitive races on community levels. If you're fed up after playing one too many kaizo levels in a row, there's also a singleplayer Story Mode with more than 100 courses lovingly crafted by Nintendo that'll better suit the tastes of casual Mario fans.\nRelease date: June 28, 2019\nGenre: Hybrid level builder and platformer gameplay hub\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nNintendo Switch game FAQs\nWhat Nintendo Switch games are coming out?\nThe Switch still has a respectable slate of games from many of Nintendo's biggest series slated for release in 2025, including Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD and Pokemon Legends: Z-A.

Fortunately, Nintendo has confirmed that the original pricing still stands. The console is available for $450, with the Mario Kart World bundle priced at $500. However, there has been a change to the price of some accessories, with some increasing by $5.\nWill the Nintendo Switch 2 come in other colors?\nFor the new Switch 2, Nintendo has ditched the colored Joy-Cons for a more sleek, monochrome look -- although there are still pops of red and blue around the analog sticks. As of now, Nintendo hasn't said anything about additional colors. Additionally, it's rumored that Samsung -- which makes the displays for the Switch 2 -- is pushing for an OLED version of the console.\nIs the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle worth it?\nThe Mario Kart series has been a long-standing tentpole for Nintendo and fans were thrilled to hear that a new title would be accompanying the new console. But the excitement was dampened by the announcement that the new game will come with an increased price tag: $80 for the digital edition or $90 if you want a physical copy. However, you can bundle a digital copy with the console for $500 total, which saves you $30 compared with buying them separately. It's an excellent value if it's a game you're certain you want in your library and likely the only \"discount\" we'll see on this title for quite some time. Plus, Nintendo recently announced that this bundle will be available only \"through fall 2025,\" which means you'll have a limited chance to take advantage of these savings.\nNintendo Switch 2: What are people saying?\nThere are still some mixed feelings about Nintendo's newest console. While some are happy to see that Nintendo hasn't altered much about the wildly popular original Switch, others feel not enough has changed to justify the $150 price hike -- with CNET gaming expert Scott Stein calling it a console that \"feels a lot like an updated version of a system many people already own.\" The confirmation that the US tariffs won't be leading to any further price increases has helped stifle gamers' exasperation a bit, but many are still unhappy with the fact that select games will be selling for up to $20 more than the standard $60. We're eager to see if most gamers consider the price hikes worth it now that they're finally getting their hands on the new console and games."

      "text": "Nintendo says it's raising prices for the original Switch hardware lineup and select accessories. The company didn't provide details of how much the price will increase or give a reason why other than saying the increase was \"based on market conditions,\" which is likely a reference to the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.\nThe Switch OLED, Nintendo Switch, Switch Lite and certain accessories will see a price jump starting on Sunday, Aug. 3, the company said in a post Friday. Nintendo says it will not increase the price of the recently released Switch 2, but did mention that \"price adjustments may be necessary in the future.\"\nOther non-Switch accessories will also see a price increase. This includes certain Switch 2 accessories, Amiibo and the Nintendo Alarmo. Nintendo's announcement didn't provide details about the changes, but retailers adjusted their prices on Friday morning. The retailers have since reverted the listings to the original amounts, making it unclear if these higher prices are official.\nUpdated list of Nintendo Switch hardware getting price increases\n- Nintendo Switch OLED Model: $350 to $400\n- Nintendo Switch: $300 to $340\n- Nintendo Switch Lite: $200 to $230\n- Nintendo Sound Clock Alarmo: $100 to $110\n- Joy-Con 2 Controllers: $95 to $100\n- Joy-Con 1 Controllers: $80 to $90\n- Joy-Con 1 Charging Stand: $30 to $35\n- Other Select Nintendo Switch accessories\n- Other Select Nintendo Switch 2 accessories\n- Select Amiibo\nList of Nintendo Switch products not getting price increases\n- Nintendo Switch 2\n- Physical Nintendo Switch games\n- Physical Nintendo Switch 2 games\n- Digital Nintendo Switch games\n- Digital Nintendo Switch 2 games\n- Nintendo Switch Online memberships\nNintendo didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment.\nWhen the Switch 2 made its debut, there were concerns about the pricing of the console. The $450 launch price was higher than any other Nintendo console previously released, with some considering that it was higher to include possible tariffs. That same day, Trump announced a new set of tariffs on countries the US trades with.\nThree of those countries -- China, Vietnam and Japan -- are vital for Nintendo's business. Japan is the most obvious, as Nintendo is based there. China is also easy to recognize as the country that manufactures most of Nintendo's products, while Vietnam is the other country that produces the hardware for the company. Due to that announcement, Nintendo delayed preorders for the Switch 2 for the US.\nNintendo did end up launching the Switch 2 at the originally announced price, but some accessories did increase in price before the system's debut. If Nintendo increased the price of the Switch 2, experts said the jump could be by up to $100.\nNot all retailers have increased their prices as of Friday on the original Switch hardware, so if you're looking to pick one up, you should buy it before Aug. 3. The same could be said for gamers who want a Switch 2, as that price could hike up soon."

      "text": "The question of how new tariffs will affect prices is more relevant than ever, with President Donald Trump's new reciprocal tariff deadline only days away and a new Consumer Price Index summary showing that the inflation rate was 2.7% in June, the biggest jump since February. It's enough to get anyone concerned about affordability in the US -- as if we all weren't worrying about it already -- and the worst of it still might not have arrived yet.\nAmid those worries, I've been tracking prices every day for 11 key products likely to be hit by price increases from tariffs and the picture I've painted so far is this: Not much has changed, at least not yet. The winding road of tariff inflation still stretches before us into an uncertain future and the threat of price hikes continues to cloud the horizon. As some economists recently told Vox, the upward trend in inflation is almost certain to continue if Trump's tariffs remain at the levels being discussed.\nTo date, I've seen two noteworthy price increases, one for the Xbox Series X and the other for a popular budget-friendly 4K TV. Some other products have gone on sale for brief periods. Notably, other outlets have caught a number of major retailers hiking prices across the board, with CNBC finding some substantial inflation at Walmart specifically.\nCNET Tariff Tracker Index\nAbove, you can check out a chart with the average price of the 11 products included in this piece over the course of 2025. This will help give you a sense of the overall price changes and fluctuations going on. Further down, you'll be able to check out charts for each individual product being tracked. Based on the numbers so far, the average has gone up noticeably since the start of the year but this has been driven mostly by big shifts for a few products, as most price are still stable.\nWe'll be updating this article regularly as prices change. It's all in the name of helping you make sense of things so be sure to check back every so often. For more, check out CNET's guide to whether you should wait to make big purchases or buy them now and get expert tips about how to prepare for a recession.\nMethodology\nWe're checking prices daily and will update the article and the relevant charts right away to reflect any changes. The following charts show a single bullet point for each month, with the most recent one labeled \"Now\" and showing the current price. For the past months, we've gone with what was the most common price for each item in the given month.\nIn most cases, the price stats used in these graphs were pulled from Amazon using the historical price-tracker tool Keepa. For the iPhones, the prices come from Apple's official materials and are based on the 128-gigabyte base model of the latest offering of the iPhone 16. For the Xbox Series X, the prices were sourced from Best Buy using the tool PriceTracker. If any of these products happen to be on sale at a given time, we'll be sure to let you know and explain how those price drops differ from longer-term pricing trends that tariffs can cause.\nThe 11 products we're tracking\nMostly what we're tracking in this article are electronic devices and digital items that CNET covers in depth, like iPhones and affordable 4K TVs -- along with a typical bag of coffee, a more humble product that isn't produced in the US to any significant degree.\nThe products featured were chosen for a few reasons: Some of them are popular and/or affordable representatives for major consumer tech categories, like smartphones, TVs and game consoles. Others are meant to represent things that consumers might buy more frequently, like printer ink or coffee beans. Some products were chosen over others because they are likely more susceptible to tariffs. Some of these products have been reviewed by CNET or have been featured in some of our best lists.\n- iPhone 16, 128GB\n- Duracell AA batteries, 24-pack\n- Samsung DU7200 65-inch TV\n- Xbox Series X\n- Apple AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C case\n- HP 962 CMY Printer Ink\n- Anker 10,000-mAh, 30-watt power bank\n- Bose TV speaker\n- Oral-B Pro 1000 electric toothbrush\n- Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook, 256GB\n- Starbucks 28-ounce ground dark roast coffee\nBelow, we'll get into more about each individual product, and stick around till the end for a rundown of some other products worth noting.\niPhone 16\nThe iPhone is the most popular smartphone brand in the US, so this was a clear priority for price tracking. The iPhone has also emerged as a major focal point for conversations about tariffs, given its popularity and its susceptibility to import taxes because of its overseas production, largely in China. Trump has reportedly been fixated on the idea that the iPhone can and should be manufactured in the US, an idea that experts have dismissed as a fantasy. Estimates have also suggested that a US-made iPhone would cost as much as $3,500.\nSomething to note about this graph: The price listed is the one you'll see if you buy your phone through a major carrier. If you, say, buy direct from Apple or Best Buy without a carrier involved, you'll be charged an extra $30, so in some places, you might see the list price of the standard iPhone 16 listed as $830.\nApple's been taking a few steps to protect its prices in the face of these tariffs, flying in bulk shipments of product before they took effect and planning to move production for the US market from China to India. A new Reuters report found that a staggering 97% of iPhones imported from the latter country, March through May, were bound for the US. This latter move drew the anger of Trump again, threatening the company with a 25% tariff if they didn't move production to the US, an idea CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly shot down in the past. This came after Trump gave a tariff exemption to electronic devices including smartphones, so the future of that move seems in doubt now.\nDuracell AA batteries\nA lot of the tech products in your home might boast a rechargeable energy source but individual batteries are still an everyday essential and I can tell you from experience that as soon as you forget about them, you'll be needing to restock. The Duracell AAs we're tracking are some of the bestselling batteries on Amazon.\nSamsung DU7200 TV\nAlongside smartphones, televisions are some of the most popular tech products out there, even if they're an infrequent purchase. This particular product is a popular entry-level 4K TV and was CNET's pick for best overall budget TV for 2025. Unlike a lot of tech products that have key supply lines in China, Samsung is a South Korean company, so it might have some measure of tariff resistance.\nAfter spending most of 2025 hovering around $400, this item has now seen some notable upticks on Amazon, most recently sitting around $450, a change that has stuck around long enough to seem permanent. This could potentially be in reaction to Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs against South Korea.\nXbox Series X\nVideo game software and hardware are a market segment expected to be hit hard by the Trump tariffs. Microsoft's Xbox is the first console brand to see price hikes -- the company cited \"market conditions\" along with the rising cost of development. Most notably, this included an increase in the price of the flagship Xbox Series X, up from $500 to $600. Numerous Xbox accessories also were affected and the company also said that \"certain\" games will eventually see a price hike from $70 to $80.\nInitially, we were tracking the price of the much more popular Nintendo Switch as a representative of the gaming market. Nintendo has not yet hiked the price of its handheld-console hybrid and stressed that the $450 price tag of the upcoming Switch 2 has not yet been inflated because of tariffs. Sony, meanwhile, has so far only increased prices on its PlayStation hardware in markets outside the US.\nAirPods Pro 2\nThe latest iteration of Apple's wildly popular true-wireless earbuds are here to represent the headphone market. Much to the chagrin of the audiophiles out there, a quick look at sales charts on Amazon shows you just how much the brand dominates all headphone sales.\nHP 962 CMY printer ink\nThis HP printer ink includes cyan, magenta and yellow all in one product and recently saw its price jump from around $72 -- where it stayed for most of 2025 -- to $80, which is around its highest price over the last five years. We will be keeping tabs to see if this is a long-term change or a brief uptick.\nThis product replaced Overture PLA Filament for 3D printers in this piece, but we're still tracking that item.\nAnker 10,000-mAh, 30-watt power bank\nAnker's accessories are perennially popular in the tech space and the company has already announced that some of its products will get more expensive as a direct result of tariffs. This specific product has also been featured in some of CNET's lists of the best portable chargers.\nBose TV speaker\nSoundbars have become important purchases, given the often iffy quality of the speakers built into TVs. While not the biggest or the best offering in the space, the Bose TV Speaker is one of the more affordable soundbar options out there, especially hailing from a brand as popular as Bose.\nOral-B Pro 1000 electric toothbrush\nThey might be a lot more expensive than their traditional counterparts but electric toothbrushes remain a popular choice for consumers because of how well they get the job done. I know my dentist won't let up on how much I need one. This particular Oral-B offering was CNET's overall choice for the best electric toothbrush for 2025.\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook\nLenovo is notable among the big laptop manufacturers for being a Chinese company making its products especially susceptible to Trump's tariffs. For now, its price on Amazon has remained pretty much static, aside from some brief dips down to $480.\nStarbucks Ground Coffee (28-ounce bag)\nCoffee is included in this tracker because of its ubiquity -- I'm certainly drinking too much of it these days -- and because it's uniquely susceptible to Trump's tariff agenda. Famously, coffee beans can only be grown within a certain distance from Earth's equator, a tropical span largely outside the US and known as the \"Coffee Belt.\"\nHawaii is the only part of the US that can produce coffee beans, with data from USAFacts showing that 11.5 million pounds were harvested there in the 2022-23 season -- little more than a drop in the mug, as the US consumed 282 times that amount of coffee during that period. Making matters worse, Hawaiian coffee production has declined in the past few years.\nAll that to say: Americans get almost all of their coffee from overseas, making it one of the most likely products to see price hikes from tariffs. While this particular bag of beans from Starbucks hasn't seen its price budge for most of the year, in recent days it ticked up by less than a dollar on Amazon, which could be a sign of further increases to come.\nOther products\nAs mentioned, we occasionally swap out products with different ones that undergo notable price shifts. Here are some things no longer featured above, but that we're still keeping an eye on:\n- Nintendo Switch: The baseline handheld-console hybrid has held steady around $299 most places -- including Amazon -- since it released in 2017. Whether that price will be affected by tariffs or the release of the Switch 2 remains to be seen. This product was replaced above with the Xbox Series X.\n- Overture PLA 3D printer filament: This is a popular choice on Amazon for the material needed to run 3D printers. It has held steady around $15 on Amazon all year. This product was replaced above by the HP 962 printer ink.\nHere are some products we also wanted to single out that haven't been featured with a graph yet:\n- Razer Blade 18 (2025), 5070 Ti edition: The latest revision of Razer's largest gaming laptop saw a $300 price bump recently, with the base model featured an RTX 5070 Ti graphics card now priced at $3,500 ahead of launch, compared to the $3,200 price announced in February. While Razer has stayed mum about the reasoning, it did previously suspend direct sales to the US as Trump's tariff plans were ramping up in April.\n- Asus ROG Ally X: The premium version of Asus's Steam Deck competitor handheld gaming PC recently saw a price hike from $799 to $899, coinciding with the announcement of the company's upcoming Xbox-branded Ally handhelds."

      "text": "The Nintendo Switch is 5 years old this year. Since the original Switch debuted in 2017, we've seen the release of the Switch V2, the Switch Lite and the latest Nintendo Switch OLED. (Not to mention there could be another Switch on the way.) With all those options, deciding which one is best for your gaming needs can be complicated. Or even trickier: Which should you buy if you already own one of the other models?\nWhile the Switch OLED looks like the best version, it's not necessarily the right pick for everyone. Here's my advice after testing and reviewing each model.\nThe OLED Switch isn't exactly a reinvention of the console. With a larger OLED display and a better kickstand, though, it is an improvement over the original. The original Switch got a battery-life boost in 2019, which this version also has. This time, you get a bigger, more vibrant display. It has the same 720p resolution as the original Switch and Switch Lite, but looks more colorful, with more contrast and deeper black levels.\nMost of the OLED Switch's gains are for its handheld mode. It's got a larger display, louder speakers and a kickstand that finally covers the whole rear panel and also bends to multiple angles. That kickstand alone could be a reason to upgrade if you're interested in a Switch that's portable, especially for multiplayer games on the go in tabletop mode.\nThere's more included onboard storage (64GB versus 32GB on older Switches), which is enough to hold a dozen game downloads or so. But most Switch owners will just pop a microSD card in to increase storage (you can get 256GB for about $20 now). A big SD card is basically a must-have Switch accessory. The included new dock has an added Ethernet port for wired internet, but I don't care about that: I use Wi-Fi for everything and am fine.\nDespite the screen size increase, from 6.2 to 7 inches, the device's footprint is nearly the same. After all, it has to accommodate the same Joy-Con controllers, which slot onto the sides of the system when you're not holding them in your hands. That means you get more screen in the same size body, so the bezels around the display are narrower and the screen dominates your view that much more.\nGames, however, won't play any differently. Inside is the same Nvidia Tegra X1 processor as before. That hardware configuration dates back to the Switch's 2017 launch, four years ago. The competition? Consoles with newer 2020 processors.\nThe extra $50 for the OLED Switch is well worth it for the upgrades, though, particularly the screen and kickstand. If you're new to Switch life, it's the one to pick. But it just doesn't seem as necessary if you already own a Switch.\nThe Switch Lite, at $199, is $150 less than the OLED Switch, which is a significant price drop. It plays all the same games, too. The Lite's construction quality is excellent, and it's compact and more pocketable. It lacks the TV-docking feature of the larger Switches, however, which means you lose using it as a TV-connected game console. You also can't detach its controllers.\nThat's a big loss for families, or for anyone who likes couch gaming. It de-Switches the Switch, making it just a handheld. That being said, it's an excellent second or travel Switch for families, and it's a powerful successor to the Nintendo 3DS if you just want some casual handheld games, period.\nNintendo Switch\nIf it's on sale, consider it\nThe classic Switch sticks around at $300, which right now seems absurd. The OLED Switch is absolutely the one you should get instead, but sales could change the equation. We don't see any Switch sales now, but if that original version were to get bundled with included games or a drop in price (provided it's the V2 revision in 2019 with longer battery life), it could be worth picking up for the savings over the OLED model. When docked with a TV, the experience will feel exactly the same. Needless to say, if you only play in docked mode, treating the Switch as a permanently anchored living room console, this is the one to get.\nMaking the upgrade call: Solo vs. group; TV vs. handheld; budget vs. splurge\nThe biggest factors to weigh out involve how you're planning to use the Switch. This is how you'll know Switch makes most sense for you, and they're more important than any single spec.\nPlaying solo vs. friends and family: If you're a solo gamer, you might be fine with a Switch Lite, especially if you're playing in a cramped dorm room or at your cubicle. If you're a little more liquid, the OLED Switch with the bigger screen is a luxury choice, and a must for TV-docking. But for families playing games, make sure you get a Switch that docks to a TV (sorry, Lite).\nAlmost always playing on a TV: If this is you, don't get a Switch Lite. But also, if it's all happening on the big screen, maybe you don't need the OLED Switch either. Stick with the original.\nMainly handheld gaming: The Lite is portable and cheap, but handheld-only. The OLED model has a great screen, but it's bigger and more expensive. Deciding whether you need that better screen could come down to whether you're 70% handheld or 90% handheld.\nMoney's no object: Then get the OLED Switch, obviously. (It's not that expensive at $350, all things considered.)\nWill there be a new Switch this year? Nintendo can't seem to help coming up with new models of its handheld game hardware every other year or so. Reports of a graphics-upgraded 4K Switch still loom, maybe called the Switch Pro, or the Switch 2. Just a reminder that the OLED Switch almost certainly won't be the final Switch. You could always just wait it out and be happy with the Switch you have (if you have one).\nFor more, check out why you shouldn't worry about OLED screen burn-in on the Nintendo Switch and the best controllers for the Switch."

      "text": "Nintendo's modular console-handheld is over two years old now, and still one of our favorite gadgets on the planet. The game library is fantastic, and a newer version with even better battery life (at the same price) exists now that you should get -- just make sure you buy the right model. Nintendo also has the lower-priced portable-only Switch Lite, which is excellent if all you want is a handheld game experience... but for the TV and multiplayer versatility alone, we still recommend this larger-sized Switch first.\nThe Good\nThe Bad\nThe Bottom Line\nEditor's note: This review was updated Dec. 6, 2019 with an Editors' Choice award and the above paragraph reflecting Switch variations on the market. It was previously updated from its earlier March 2017 version to reflect the impressive expansion of the Switch's game library, with the rating raised from 3.5 stars to 4. Otherwise the original review follows below.\nWhen Nintendo's Switch was first released, laying out $300 (\u00a3280, AU$470) plus another $60 (\u00a360, AU$90) for a game -- the admittedly fantastic Zelda: Breath of the Wild -- seemed like a lot. But things have changed.\nSince its debut in March 2017, the Nintendo Switch has shown that Nintendo is still willing to take risks to separate itself from the rest of the pack, and at the same time innovate in way that no one could really see coming. The Switch is a fantastic hybrid console that offers plenty of unique and compelling gaming experiences all while providing a solid amount of indie titles that seem perfect for the platform. Nintendo still needs to address its Virtual Console void but overall the Switch is already a winner.\nSince its launch, the Switch's eShop has been continually populated with great indie titles that support its growing full-priced standard offerings. Breath of the Wild was an amazing launch title and remains a superb 100-hour endeavor. And it's since been joined by Super Mario Odyssey -- the platform's second must-have exclusive game in just eight months. Now players can also enjoy Mario Kart 8: Deluxe Edition, Splatoon 2, Arms and other Nintendo-only titles. For digital-only titles we really love Thumper, Cave Story, Wonder Boy, Shovel Knight and GoNNER. Those aren't Nintendo-only exclusives, nor are recent or imminent titles such as Rocket League, Doom, Skyrim and Wolfenstein II. But for many of them, it's the first time you'll be able to play them on a plane without lugging a giant gaming laptop with you. More titles are released most weeks.\nEven better, the Switch is no longer impossible to track down. And Nintendo is offering a version bundled with Super Mario Odyssey and a portable case for $380. It's not a bargain, but it includes the game every new owner will definitely want at a fair price.\nSwitched on\nThe Switch's instant success can be attributed to Nintendo swinging for the fences: the Switch is a hybrid console, meaning it can be played on a TV at home or on the go as a handheld. The Joy-Con controllers make the Switch a veritable Transformer: keep them attached to the sides in tablet mode, slide them off and prop up the screen on a table to play one- or two-player games, or dock the Switch in its included charging cradle to play on your big-screen TV. The idea is that you'll get the same basic experience regardless of how you play.\nThe Nintendo Switch is a much more elegantly designed console from top to bottom, light-years ahead of the plastic goofiness of its spiritual predecessor, the GamePad on 2012's Wii U. It feels solid in its construction -- expensive, even -- and demonstrates a mature refinement throughout. Even the operating system is clean and fast -- a stark contrast compared to what the Wii U ran on.\nJust looking at the Switch's primary focus of being a practical home-and-on-the-go console, the Switch definitely nails it. There is something awesome about taking a huge game like Zelda -- or Skyrim or L.A. Noire -- with you wherever you go. It is perfect for my train commute to work, and it works well on a plane, too. And while battery life is far from marathon levels, there are solid options for charging the Switch when an outlet isn't available. Out of all the portable solutions I tested, the RavPower Power Bank became my go-to device. Its high capacity battery actually charged the Switch as opposed to slowing down battery drain.\nAt this point there are plenty of games to enjoy on the platform, all for varying prices. But if you're looking for entertainment beyond games you're mostly out of luck. But Hulu was unexpectedly added for US Switch owners in November, so maybe the likes of Netflix and Amazon may eventually follow.\nBut the bigger annoyance on the Switch is the curious dearth of retro gaming titles. A lot of work needs to be done in the Virtual Console department. Nintendo hasn't detailed how or when it will be migrating to the Switch. Whether or not any of the digital Virtual Console games you've purchased on previous Nintendo hardware will work on the Switch is also a mystery. But Wii, Wii U discs and 3DS game cartridges definitely don't work here.\nIt's worth noting that the console's debut was marred by concern regarding the left Joy-Con controller's reliability when using it with the Switch docked. Multiple outlets had reported issues with connectivity and performance. While I didn't experience these with the frequency that other reviewers have, I wasn't completely immune from them, either. But, Nintendo has recognized the issue and fixed manufacturing moving forward. If you buy your Switch new, it's a non-issue.\nWith the arrival of Splatoon 2 on July 21, 2017, the Switch also received a smartphone app for Android and iOS. The app is meant to be a companion for games on the system and a multiplayer hub where players can connect with friends and invite each other to matches. It's also meant to be the Switch's voicechat solution as wonky as it appears on its face. Yes, it's kind of awkward. But game chat is constantly-changing landscape. With the rise of third-party services like Discord being used for universal game chat, we don't necessarily think the Switch's current multiplayer situation is a dealbreaker.\nNintendo says that the Switch's online services will be free until 2018, when it will change over to a paid service for about $20 a year. That will also include special eShop deals and access to legacy games, though we still don't know how exactly that will be handled.\nBecause of the ever-changing nature of consoles, consider this review a constant work in progress. We'll continue to update our review as more games and functionality comes to the system.\nCheck out GameSpot's complete coverage of the Nintendo Switch.\nWhat's good about the Switch\n- Versatility: The novelty that comes with taking the console on the go does not get old. So far it's been a mostly flawless experience. Switching is great.\n- The operating system: While there's not much to it, the Switch's OS is zippy, clean and lets you resume gameplay from sleep mode in seconds. Even a full powering on takes no time at all.\n- Local multiplayer: We've successfully played 2- and 4-player co-op in tablet mode, though the small screen size becomes very apparent here. The Switch also allows up to eight tablets to be locally connected for multiplayer, but we've never tried that many.\n- Screen capturing: A dedicated capture button on the left Joy-Con takes a screenshot of whatever you see onscreen. It works just as you'd want it to -- quickly and easily. You can also connect the Switch to your Facebook and Twitter account for quick sharing. As of now there doesn't seem to be option for recording video though.\n- Amiibos: Those adorable toy-to-life figures are still a thing for the Switch, so if you spent money on them in the last few years, you're in luck.\n- Nintendo has committed to indie games -- at least for 2017 -- announcing that over 60 titles will hit the platform by year's end. There are plenty of great indie games already available in the eShop.\n- MicroSD storage: You can bring your own flash storage to the Switch ensuring room for plenty of downloadable games.\nThe Switch's problems\n- The Virtual Console is MIA at launch, and its unclear how it'll be offered when the Nintendo online service launches in 2018.\n- Screen size: When using it as a handheld device the Switch's screen is fine, but as a tabletop display it's another story. Because of its small text, it's tough to play Zelda from any farther than around two feet away. Other games might be more lenient about distance, but a group crowding around a screen to play doesn't seem as practical.\n- The kickstand: The plastic flap that hides the Switch's microSD slot is also its kickstand. Unfortunately it's very flimsy and doesn't seem sturdy at all. At the very least I wish there was another one on the other side of the screen for balance. If it's on a hard, flat surface it won't just topple over for no reason, but getting it to sit right the first time isn't as easy as you'd think. Bumping into the table it's resting on could make it fall over, and I'd imagine some airplane turbulence might knock it down,too. Don't expect the stability of the sort of full-width stand you get with a Microsoft Surface or an iPad case.\n- No wireless audio: You can pretty much count out any kind of wireless audio solution for the Switch. Other consoles have made this a baseline feature, but don't expect to see it on the Switch.\n- \"HD Rumble:\" Nintendo might be overpromising with the vibration feedback in the Joy-Con controllers. It's tough to sniff out why it's so much better because right now -- save for a few mini-games in 1-2 Switch. Overall, it just feels weaker than other controllers out there. Maybe this will change.\n- Outdoor use: Sure, you can take the Switch with you anywhere, but the screen is really tough to see outdoors, especially anywhere it's sunny.\n- Onboard storage: With just 32GB of storage inside, it's almost guaranteed you'll eventually need to get a microSD card.\n- Joy-Con wrist-straps: Removing these plastic covers from the Joy-Con is surprisingly annoying.\nNow's the time to buy a Switch\nThe Switch's first five months have been impressive and now that we're closing in on a year it's easy to give it a slam dunk recommendation.\nIf there's anything that still gives us pause, it's the uncertainty of a Virtual Console and the still yet-to-be-fully-detailed online service that will launch in 2018.\nAside from those few lingering concerns, the Switch continues to get better week by week. Its runaway away success guarantees that it will see support from first- and third-party developers for many years to come."

  "argos_summary": "The Nintendo Switch 2, released in June 2025, has quickly gained popularity despite its high price of $450, with a Mario Kart World bundle available for $500. Nintendo has announced price increases for previous Switch models, making current deals on the Switch OLED, now priced at $400, particularly appealing at $299. While the Switch 2 offers significant upgrades in graphics and design, it suffers from battery life issues and limited onboard storage, which may lead some gamers to consider waiting for future models or additional game releases.",
