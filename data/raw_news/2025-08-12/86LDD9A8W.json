  "content": "From catcalls to the doghouse.\n\nFemale cops in England went undercover as joggers, wearing tight-fitting clothes in a bid to elicit catcalls \u2014 and then arrested some of the men who hit on them, according to a report.\n\nThe Surrey Police Department created a trial task force, which lasted about a month, and led to 18 arrests for offences like sexual assault, harassment, and theft, The Telegraph reported.\n\nThe female officers were sent during rush hour to \u201chot spots\u201d where open sexual harassment of women is commonplace and pretended to be joggers, the report stated.\n\n\u201cOne of our officers was honked at within 10 minutes \u2014 then another vehicle slowed down, beeping and making gestures just 30 seconds later \u2014 that\u2019s how frequent it is,\u201d Inspector Jon Vale of SPD told the outlet.\n\nOne of the officers in the group said the harassment she faced during the trial period reflects her everyday experience in Surrey.\n\n\u201cWe get catcalled. We get honked at. People slow down just to stare \u2014 or lean out the window to shout something. It\u2019s so common, but it\u2019s harassment and it needs to be recognized as such,\u201d Officer Abby Hayward told the Telegraph.\n\n\u201cThis behavior is either a precursor to something more serious \u2014 or it\u2019s ignorance and it\u2019s fixable,\u201d the cop said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where our interventions come in: to stop potential repeat offenders or help people understand that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t OK.\u201d\n\nCritics of the program include the Free Speech Union, which said the tactic was a \u201cbizarre social-psychology experiment,\u201d and that police should enforce the laws on the books, according to the outlet.",

It\u2019s a long journey, but they got there efficiently,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd of course that means that the helicopter pilot could also fly straight to the destination with confidence that he was going to find them.\u201d\nOne of the victims was already dead when rescue crews eventually arrived at the scene, while the other was rushed to a hospital where they later succumbed to their injuries.\nThe couple made a name for themselves by documenting their travels through North and South America and ran a popular blog that showed off their extensive car and RV retrofits."

      "text": "Armed terrorists killed while posing as World Central Kitchen staff in Gaza: IDF\nA group of five armed terrorists were killed after they were caught posing as members of the World Central Kitchen humanitarian group in central Gaza, the Israeli military said Tuesday.\nVideo from Deir al-Balah, one of the few cities largely spared by the 21-month Mideast war, shows a group of men in bright vests traveling in a vehicle marked with the WCK\u2019s emblem.\n\u201cThe terrorists deliberately attached the [WCK] emblem and wore yellow vests in an attempt to disguise their activities and avoid being targeted, cynically exploiting the status and trust given to aid organizations,\u201d the Israel Defense Force said in a statement.\nThe military said its unit that oversees the distribution of humanitarian aid contacted WCK about the group spotted near Deir al-Balah, with the nonprofit confirming that the vehicle was not affiliated with them.\nWhile the IDF only confirmed that five of the men were killed, the video showed at least 10 people huddled around the car and putting on the vests before the vehicle set off.\nThe IDF did not state if the men killed in the strike were specifically with Hamas or members of other terror groups or militias based in the Gaza Strip.\nWCK said it condemned anyone who would pose as one of their employees, warning that such actions endanger real aid workers operating in Gaza.\nThe agency, founded in 2010 by Spanish-American chef and restaurateur Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, provides food relief to those around the world, with the humanitarian group currently focusing on trying to avoid the looming famine in Gaza.\nThe war in Gaza has repeatedly put humanitarian aid workers at risk, with at least 10 WCK staffers killed last year after they were hit by Israeli airstrikes, including seven who were unloading 100 tons of food.\nIsraeli officials have repeatedly apologized for the deaths, blaming Hamas for putting the aid workers at risk and accusing the group of routinely hiding behind the humanitarian efforts in Gaza."

      "text": "Moscow troops make advance in Ukraine just days before Trump set to meet with Putin\nMoscow troops made one of their most dramatic advancements of the year Tuesday when they pushed deeper into the Donetsk region of Ukraine \u2014 just three days before President Trump is set to meet with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.\nRussia\u2019s invasion forces marched some six miles past the frontlines in Donetsk to encircle the towns of Kostyantynivka, Dobropillia and Pokrovsk, advancing Moscow\u2019s goal of taking full control of the region, according to Ukraine\u2019s authoritative DeepState war map.\n\u201cThe situation is quite chaotic, as the enemy, having found gaps in the defense, is infiltrating deeper, trying to quickly consolidate and accumulate forces for further advancement,\u201d DeepState said in an update.\nDonetsk has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war, which is in its third year, with Moscow reportedly demanding full control of the region as part of the upcoming peace talks with Trump.\nThe latest advancement was centered on the coal mining town of Dobropillia, which lies just north of Pokrovsk, a key city Russia has been targeting for months.\nOleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, said Russia was using sheer numbers to overwhelm his forces along the frontlines to make small gains in the region, local Interfax-Ukraine reported.\nThe Russian forces have recently made 35 attempts to push back Kyiv\u2019s defenses before making the six-mile gain, Andriy Kovalov, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army, told the local outlet.\nSyrskyi has since ordered a new wave of reinforcements to the frontlines to end Moscow\u2019s advancements.\nThe reinforcements are \u201cto detect and destroy enemy sabotage groups that penetrate the line of defence,\u201d Kovalov said.\nSergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, touted Tuesday\u2019s advancement as the necessary leverage Putin needs ahead of his meeting with Trump.\n\u201cThis breakthrough is like a gift to Putin and Trump during the negotiations,\u201d Markov told Reuters, suggesting it could put pressure on Ukraine to give up some of its land in exchange for peace.\nExperts, however, said Russia\u2019s gains are not enough to boast a meaningful victory given the amount of soldiers and ammunition thrown into Moscow\u2019s meat grinder for an advancement of just six miles.\nGeorge Barros, of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank, said there is no evidence to suggest whole Russian platoons made it through the frontlines on Tuesday.\n\u201cWorst case, it\u2019s a tactical penetration in the localized area which the Russians will hope to certainly snowball into a larger operational penetration,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cBut it\u2019s far from clear they can either do that.\u201d\nBarros, instead, surmised that Moscow is likely playing up the attack to bolster the perception that Russia is winning the war despite the reality of months-long quagmires along the frontlines.\n\u201cThe Russians are counting on us to hyperbole it in order to give Putin more leverage and incorrectly manipulate Western presidents and his officials thinking about this,\u201d Barros warned.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the important thing. We really need the president to go into the meeting with a clear head about what this is and how Putin is trying to play this mind game.\u201d\nMoscow has maintained that one of its conditions for ending the war in Ukraine would be for Kyiv to cede all the territory that Russia has taken in more than three years of fighting.\nDonetsk is one of the territories Russia is most keen on taking, with Moscow allegedly telling Trump last week that it would be open to withdrawing its forces out of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in exchange for complete control of Donetsk, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nKyiv has maintained that it would not cede any territory to the Russian invaders, urging Trump to avoid any talks with Putin on surrendering land without Ukraine present at the negotiating table.\nWith Post wires"
