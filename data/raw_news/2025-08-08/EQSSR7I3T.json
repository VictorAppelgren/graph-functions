  "title": "Citi Says Weaker Dollar Plays Into Equities Diversification Strategy",
  "description": "The broad dollar selloff that has dominated currency markets since US President Donald Trump's April 2 tariffs announcement plays into the equities diversification strategy, according to Citigroup strategist Beata Manthey. \"You want to diversify to other parts of the world where the currency appreciation helps you,\" Manthey says on Bloomberg Television. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "The key bull cases for Europe was simply that while the Fed stays pat, the ECB can cut the RBA, we can cut and are planning to cut, and that is baked into the tailwind of the Stoxx 600. Now that we're seeing potentially a more dovish tilt or expectation of a dovish tilt from the Federal Reserve. So that undermine that component of the bull case for Europe? It depends. I do you would like to see the ECB to keep cutting. However, they've already cut a lot, right? So everything depends on what the economy is going to do going forwards. Is it going to be resilient? And from the current levels where we are quite subdued, it is plausible to see upsides into the next year, especially with the fiscal in Europe. Right. Ideally, you would like the cuts. Most likely we will get as many as we expected before. But our economist at Citi actually think that the market is underpricing the potential. So we might have a few more than the market is pricing right now. And beyond it, when we talk about monetary policy, I think we need to talk about effects because the the move in the euro has really shown up in a lot of earnings reports recently. And for what you just said, you know, we could really see a divergence in monetary policy next year if the ECB has done cutting, but then the Fed really does pick up steam. And that is an argument for a weaker dollar and a stronger euro. Do you think that kind of theme will play into the fourth quarter or the third quarter in the fourth quarter in terms of a headwind for earnings? So we've been already seeing this for quite from the start of the year as a headwind for these manufacturing exporters. But let's not forget that Europe, in terms of the equity markets, its exposure is 50, 50, 50% is domestic, 50% is international. So that's how we are still positioned. And of course, when you come back to the stimulus and what it underpins it is the domestic story, right? So I would be still backing this one, giving the headwinds. However, on the other hand, from the global investors perspective, where it plays in, it plays into diversification because most of investors around the world, they be benchmarking equity investors, I should add. They benchmark then sell themselves in the US dollars, right? So the weakness of the dollar really undermines the performance of their US holdings. Therefore, you want to diversify to other parts of the world where that where the currency appreciation helps you.",

  "summary": "Citi's economist at Citi has stated that a weaker dollar could undermine the key bull case for Europe, as the ECB can potentially cut the RBA and is planning to cut other measures. This is seen as a potential boost for the Stoxx 600 due to a more dovish tilt from the Federal Reserve. However, the economist suggests that the market is underpricing the potential of these cuts. He also notes that the weaker dollar is a key factor in European equity diversification as most investors benchmark their US holdings in US dollars, which undermines their performance as a benchmarking currency. The weakness of the dollar could also impact the performance of US holdings, leading to diversification within Europe's equity markets. Citi's analysis suggests that Europe's exposure is 50% domestic, 50% international, and 50% domestically.",

It suggests that while the ECB may continue to cut rates, the Fed's dovish stance could influence market expectations and currency dynamics, potentially leading to a weaker dollar and a stronger euro. The article emphasizes the importance of domestic versus international exposure in European equity markets and the implications for global investors seeking diversification.",
