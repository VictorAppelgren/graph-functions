  "content": "The U.S. and the E.U. reach a tariff agreement on pharmaceuticals, lumber and semiconductors. The GOP-controlled Texas House passes new congressional maps. And parole hearings are set for Erik and Lyle Menendez, the brothers convicted of killing their parents in 1989.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know today.\n\nTrump backs down on threats of 250% tariffs on some European Union products\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to limit tariffs on pharmaceuticals, lumber and semiconductors imported from the European Union to 15%, according to a new framework trade agreement. The deal also includes a promise from the E.U. to buy energy and artificial intelligence technology from the U.S., and mentions that European companies will invest an additional $600 billion \"across strategic sectors\" through 2028.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the U.S. plans to roll back tariffs on \u201cunavailable natural resources (including cork), all aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors\u201d to pre-January levels starting Sept. 1.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently threatened the European pharmaceutical industry with tariffs as high as 250% and the region\u2019s semiconductor industry with tariff rates as high as 100%.\n\nThe E.U.\u2019s blanket \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff, which took effect earlier this month, will remain 15%.\n\nTexas is set to fully enact its new congressional maps as soon as this week after the Republican-controlled state House passed the mid-decade redistricting maps. The vote came days after state Democrats returned from a two-week \u201cquorum break,\u201d but not before they took to the House floor to criticize their Republican colleagues.\n\nThe aim to pad the party\u2019s majority by as many as five seats in the midterm election, urged on by Trump, has other top Republicans in states like Indiana, Missouri and Florida considering tweaks to their maps, too. And Ohio must redraw its lines by law since a 2021 map was approved without Democratic support.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s push to counter Texas\u2019 actions with his own redraw, aimed at giving Democrats five more seats, is also still in motion. The state Legislature held an hourslong hearing this week that turned contentious amid interruptions and partisan clashes.\n\u2022 Winnie Greco, a longtime ally, adviser and fundraiser for New York Mayor Eric Adams, was suspended from his re-election campaign after she was accused of attempting to hand a cash-stuffed potato chip bag to a journalist.\n\u2022 Some military officers are set to take on roles as federal prosecutors amid the Trump administration\u2019s takeover of policing in Washington, D.C.\n\u2022 Trump has called on a Biden appointee on the Fed Board of Governors to resign over mortgage fraud allegations, making her the latest official targeted in the administration's effort to undermine critics.\n\u2022 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is pushing for ICE to operate its own fleet of planes to deport immigrants.\n\nErik and Lyle Menendez, the brothers who murdered their parents in 1989, will go before California parole officials over the next two days in a bid to show that they are suitable for release. Erik, 54, will appear before the board today. Lyle, 57, will appear tomorrow.\n\nThe brothers were convicted in 1996 after two high-profile trials. They claimed they killed their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez, in self-defense after years of abuse at their father\u2019s hands. Prosecutors have disputed those claims and described the killings as ruthless and financially motivated.\n\nEarlier this year, a Los Angeles judge found that the men do not pose an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d to society and resentenced them to 50 years to life, effectively canceling their previous terms of life without parole. Though state commissioners will determine whether the Menendez brothers are suitable for parole, the decision to release them will ultimately land with California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Read the full story here.\n\nFrank Caprio, TV judge known for kindness, dies at 88\n\nFrank Caprio, a Rhode Island judge whose compassion from the bench was showcased on the local television show \u201cCaught in Providence,\u201d has died at the age of 88.\n\nA post on his official Facebook page confirmed Caprio died after a \u201clong and courageous battle with pancreatic cancer.\u201dIn \u201cCaught in Providence,\u201d Caprio\u2019s compassionate rulings often went viral and drew national attention.\n\nHe later became a household name when his show was syndicated and later became available on Prime Video. After the announcement of Caprio\u2019s death, Gov. Dan McKee called his friend \u201ca Rhode Island treasure.\u201d Read the full story here.\n\nRead All About It\n\u2022 The effects of Hurricane Erin brought tropical storm conditions to the North Carolina coast as the Category 2 storm continued over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\u2022 Russian officials signaled they are in no rush to agree to a leaders\u2019 summit with Ukraine and warned the West that talks over security guarantees for Kyiv were a \u201croad to nowhere\u201d without its involvement.\n\u2022 The FDA and CDC are expected to approve the next round of Covid shots soon but only for a small group of people. That could leave many people having to pay out of pocket for a booster.\n\u2022 A Texas teen\u2019s health insurance company denied her twice for spinal surgery, claiming it was \u201cnot medically necessary.\u201d After NBC News reached out, it was approved the next day.\n\nTrump has demanded that the Federal Reserve cut its influential interest rates, but economists are concerned that mortgage rates will remain elevated until the economy falters. That\u2019s because mortgage rates are more closely tied to demand for longer-term government bonds like the 10-year Treasury note. When demand for those bonds increase, their interest rate, or yield, declines \u2014 and so do mortgage rates.\n\nThe 30-year mortgage rate has remained unchanged since Trump\u2019s election last November, reflecting the general uncertainty his mix of tariff, immigration and fiscal policies have created. Even the Fed\u2019s decision last year to lower its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point did little to change things. With home borrowing costs still stubbornly high, experts told me one likely way to move the needle would be a dramatically worsening economy. \u2014 Rob Wile, business reporter\n\nFor a few hours after school in Baltimore, you can find police recruits exercising, practicing yoga and learning how to breathe with Black boys from the community. It\u2019s all through an organization called Project Pneuma, which helps fourth- through eighth-graders develop healthy social and emotional skills through mentorship. The nonprofit aims to instill forgiveness, self-control and discipline in Black youth, all while building trust with police.\n\n\u201cMany have not had an opportunity to really be able to express their emotions as young Black men, and so our goal has been to help them to release those emotions and let them know that it\u2019s OK not to be OK,\u201d said Project Pneuma founder Damion Cooper.\n\nSee how Project Pneuma is, as Cooper describes it, \u201ca chance to break the stigma that young men of color and officers can\u2019t coexist.\u201d\n\nNBCU Academy is a free, award-winning education program for developing new skills and advancing careers in journalism, media and tech.\n\nThe FDA warned that four hand soap products from DermaRite may be contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

      "text": "If you\u2019re in good health and plan to get a Covid shot this fall, you might end up with an unwelcome surprise: a bill.\nThe Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the next round of Covid shots soon, but only for a smaller, high-risk group \u2014 adults 65 and older and people with underlying health conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is likely to follow suit, limiting its recommendation on who should get the shots to the same groups. (The CDC currently recommends Covid vaccination for everyone 6 months and older.)\nThe change, experts say, could affect what insurers are willing to cover for everyone else who doesn\u2019t fall under a high-risk group.\nBy law, most health insurance plans are required to fully cover vaccines recommended by the CDC and its outside advisory committee, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).\nFor those who don\u2019t fall under the CDC\u2019s new recommendations, experts say coverage would depend entirely on their insurance \u2014 with some deciding to fully cover the shot, others requiring a copay and some not covering it at all.\nWithout insurance, a Covid shot can cost up to $140, according to the CDC\u2019s vaccine price list.\n\u201cIt could very well get confusing,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and an adviser to ACIP. Whether you\u2019re able to get a free shot \u201cmay greatly depend on which company with which you have your insurance.\u201d\nWho can get a Covid vaccine?\nUnder the expected recommendations from the CDC, healthy children and adults won\u2019t be barred from getting the Covid vaccine, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at UC Law San Francisco.\n\u201cIt\u2019s legal to give a vaccine off-label,\u201d Reiss said, referring to when a doctor prescribes a drug for something different than what the FDA approved it for, \u201cand insurance companies can choose to cover them.\u201d\nA spokesperson for AHIP, a health insurance industry trade group, said that every individual insurer will come up with its own policy following the CDC\u2019s final guidance.\nThe CDC\u2019s list of conditions that put a person at high risk for severe illness from Covid is extensive, and includes cancer, heart disease and lung conditions as well as physical inactivity and depression.\nInsurers also take into account clinical recommendations from outside medical organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the spokesperson said.\nOn Tuesday, the AAP, which has expressed its disapproval for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s vaccine decisions, released its own recommendations supporting Covid vaccinations for children.\nMost people are also unlikely to notice changes to their insurance coverage overnight \u2014 if there are any, according to the AHIP spokesperson.\nFor private plans \u2014 including Obamacare plans \u2014 any changes stemming from ACIP meetings could likely only be implemented in the next benefit year, typically Jan. 1, the spokesperson said. That means it\u2019s possible that people who get a shot before then might be covered. Medicare and Medicaid plans are required to follow ACIP recommendations immediately upon the CDC director\u2019s signature. Covid vaccines have also already been factored into insurers\u2019 plans for this year.\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Blue Cross and Blue Shield said that \u201ceach independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan will make their own coverage decisions.\u201d\nCovid and flu shots\nThe changes could affect people planning to get their Covid and flu vaccines at the same time.\nSchaffner, of Vanderbilt, said some people choose to get their Covid and flu shots at the same time, but there are concerns that some could be turned away due to the anticpated change in recommendations.\nHe added that misinformation about who is able to get the Covid shots may also discourage people from getting either vaccine.\n\u201cI think we have to reassure people, particularly those at high risk, that the vaccine will be available to them,\u201d he said.\nRick Gates, Walgreens\u2019 chief pharmacy officer, said its pharmacists usually determine whether a patient has coverage before a vaccine is administered.\nBecause of this, it\u2019s unlikely anyone would be hit with a surprise bill due to new CDC recommendations, he said, adding that the patient would first be told whether the vaccine is fully covered, a copay is required or the patient must pay entirely out of pocket.\nGates said that people are already coming in for their flu shot, but many seem to be holding off on the Covid shot until the updated version is available. During last year\u2019s respiratory virus season peak, he said, more than 50% of patients got both shots at once \u2014 a number that has grown over the past two to three years."

      "text": "The Republican-controlled Texas House has passed new congressional maps that aim to pad the party\u2019s majority in Washington by as much as five seats in the midterm elections as battles over redistricting spread across the country.\nWith Texas set to fully enact its new plan as soon as this week, urged on by President Donald Trump, California Democrats are moving quickly to implement a plan to carve up their state's maps in retaliation. Meanwhile, top Republicans in states like Indiana, Missouri and Florida continue to talk about tweaking their maps to create more Republican-controlled congressional seats in the 2026 elections. Ohio\u2019s redraw, which it must do under state law, could benefit the GOP, too.\nGovernors in Democratic-controlled states are weighing responses, too, but in many cases, they\u2019re restrained by procedural hurdles or by other practical limits \u2014 some have already stretched their own gerrymandered maps as far as they could go \u2014 that could make a tit-for-tat more difficult.\nIt\u2019s all expected to come to a head in a matter of weeks, against the backdrop of a race for the congressional majority in Washington that sits on a knife\u2019s edge.\nThe final outcome in Texas\nLawmakers in the GOP-controlled Texas House passed their map Wednesday, days after Democrats returned from a two-week \"quorum break\" in which they fled the state to hold up the bill. But they could only delay, not derail, the new Republican maps, which convert three deep-blue districts into deep-red ones and tilt two Democratic-held South Texas districts slightly further toward the GOP, too.\nState Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who represents Corpus Christi and co-sponsored the new map, kicked off the day with some straight talk.\n\u201cThe underlying goal is this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,\u201d he told his colleagues, adding that the crux of the changes to the maps center on five districts that \u201cnow trend Republican in political performance.\u201d\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no guarantee of an electorate success, Republicans will now have an opportunity to potentially win those districts,\u201d he added.\nAfter a handful of lawmakers remained in the chamber overnight to protest House leadership for requiring Democrats to agree to police escorts to ensure they don't try to skip town again, Democrats took to the floor to criticize their Republican colleagues over the maps. They questioned whether their Republican colleagues were truly not factoring in the racial compositions of districts, as they claimed, warning Democrats will have \"their day in federal court.\" They also hit out at their scheduling in the special legislative session, which put redistricting on the calendar ahead of voting on relief for the victims of the July floods in the Hill Country.\n\u201cThis is Donald Trump\u2019s map. It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows the voters are rejecting his agenda, and instead of respecting that rejection, he\u2019s changing the rules,\" said state Rep. John Bucy III of Austin, a Democrat. \"Instead of listening to the people, he\u2019s trying to silence them, and Texas Republicans have been more than willing to help.\u201d\nCalifornia Democrats move to retaliate\nCalifornia's Legislature held an hourslong hearing Tuesday as Democrats there speed toward passing legislation that would call for a fall special election putting redistricting on the ballot. Voters will decide whether to override the state's independent redistricting commission and approve temporary, Democratic-drawn maps for the rest of the decade.\nThose maps are the political inverse of the ones in Texas \u2014 endangering a handful of incumbent Republicans and putting Democrats in position to net up to five seats from the new map, according to estimates from the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\nThe hearing turned contentious amid interruptions and partisan clashes between lawmakers. Republicans repeatedly accused Democrats of wasting state resources \u2014 a statewide special election would cost significant money \u2014 and for bucking the agreement that empowered the state\u2019s independent redistricting panel in the first place.\n\u201cCalifornia should lead the way \u2014 when other states decide to do something else, we shouldn\u2019t react to them; we should prove by example that we can do this better. That we create the foundations for the rest of the nation,\u201d said Assemblyman David Tangipa, a Republican from the Fresno area.\nSteve Bennett, a Democratic legislator from Ventura, lashed out at Texas Republicans\u2019 mid-decade redistricting by comparing it to power grabs by \u201cautocrats\u201d like Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"We prefer the agreement we all had to play by the old rules,\" he said. \"But when autocrats change the rules and the norms that we are using to decide who has power, we can either fight back or we can potentially permanently lose the ability ever to fight back again.\"\nDemocrats need to get the maps passed through the Legislature soon to bring the question to the voters this fall if they want to enact the maps in time for the 2026 midterms.\nRepublicans are seeking to delay that, with a group of lawmakers suing this week, arguing that Democrats haven\u2019t given the public the required time to review legislation before voting.\nOther states weigh jumping into the fray\nWhile the spotlight remains on California and Texas, redistricting remains a live ball in other states.\nOhio must redraw its lines by law, since the Legislature approved its 2021 map without Democratic support. The timing could work out well for Republicans, who control the Legislature and could stand to gain depending on how the maps are drawn.\nTwo of Ohio's five Democratic House members won re-election last cycle by less than 3 percentage points.\nIndiana\u2019s Republican members of Congress have in recent days announced their support for a redraw there, where the party already controls seven of the nine congressional seats.\nGov. Mike Braun, a Republican, hasn\u2019t said whether he plans to call for a special session of the Legislature. But Vice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana this month to meet with Braun as the redistricting debate swirled.\nIn Missouri, Republicans have been cajoling Gov. Mike Kehoe to call a special legislative session for redistricting there, where the GOP controls six of the eight congressional seats.\nIn Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said this week that people can \u201canticipate\u201d a mid-decade redraw because there has been a \u201csea change in demography\u201d since the 2020 census.\nOutside of California, where their efforts are subject to approval from voters, Democrats face a smattering of other challenges if they want to redraw maps in other states.\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has vocally supported the Texas House Democrats' attempts to delay the redistricting process in their state, hasn't ruled out a redistricting push in his backyard. But Democrats already hold 14 of the state's 17 congressional districts there.\nNew York Democrats are also interested in redrawing the lines there, but they face logistical hurdles to change the state constitution, which would most likely mean no changes until 2028 at the earliest."

      "text": "Between balancing schoolwork and dealing with hormonal changes, the teenage experience is filled with obstacles. Perhaps the most common and frustrating of them all are frequent breakouts.\nAcne affects an estimated 80% of people between ages 11 and 30 at some point in their lives, according to The National Institutes for Health. It\u2019s most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and affects boys a bit later (ages 16 to 19 years old). This can take a toll on teens\u2019 self-esteem: Adolescents and young adults who suffer from acne have higher rates of anxiety and depression, according to the New England Journal of Medicine.\nIf you suffer from breakouts, don\u2019t get discouraged: Acne can be one of the more anxiety-inducing parts of being a teenager, but most cases are entirely curable, says Dr. Mona Gohara, a dermatologist at Dermatology Physicians of Connecticut. I spoke to dermatologists about how to treat teen breakouts and the best acne-fighting ingredients to look for. I also compiled experts\u2019 top picks for the best acne facial cleansers and spot treatments to shop, along with products we used and loved as teens.\nExperts recommend looking for the following ingredients and products to include in your daily skin care routine:\n- Face cleansers: Look for a face wash labeled noncomedogenic, which means it won\u2019t clog your pores or lead to more breakouts. Your daily face wash should include ingredients like salicylic acid (an exfoliant that removes dead skin and unclogs pores) and benzoyl peroxide (a topical antiseptic that kills acne-causing bacteria), experts say. These ingredients may come with some side effects, including irritated and flaky, dry skin, so you should use them only a couple of times a week to start and gradually increase use as your skin adjusts, says Dr. Samer Jaber, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Washington Square Dermatology in New York City.\n- Spot treatments: These help target a specific pimple and should be applied directly on the breakout, never to your entire face, experts say. Similar to an acne-fighting cleanser, look for ingredients like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. For more stubborn cystic acne, consider a retinoid like adapalene, which is available over-the-counter and helps unclog pores and regulate cell turnover, according to dermatologists I spoke to.\n- Retinoids: Retinoids derive from vitamin A and are a popular acne treatment for all ages. Both prescription retinoids (like tretinoin and tazarotene) and OTC options (like adapalene) help unclog pores and get rid of dead skin by increasing cell turnover, experts say. Keep in mind retinoids can be irritating and drying, especially if you have sensitive skin. Introduce them slowly and start by applying them only once a week, says Gohara. (More on retinoids below.)\n- Gentle exfoliants: Even though teen skin tends to regularly self-exfoliate, you can still use non-abrasive chemical exfoliants to get rid of breakouts. These include alpha hydroxy acids (like glycolic and lactic acid) and salicylic acid. Steer clear of harsh scrubs, which can worsen acne and inflammation. Like retinoids, exfoliants can be irritating and drying, so incorporate them slowly into your routine.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nBelow, I gathered expert-recommended face washes, spot treatments, retinoids, pimple patches and more that can help improve teen acne. All of the following acne products are noncomedogenic and include gentle or acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and adapalene.\nBest overall\nDifferin Gel is an NBC Select Wellness Award winner and staff-favorite. NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin started using Differin gel for her hormonal and cystic acne as a teenager since it is the only OTC retinoid that does not require a prescription. \u201cIt helped reduce my acne in a few days when I used it as a spot treatment, which, as a high schooler, was perfect because it made me less insecure about my skin,\u201d she says.\nThis treatment has 0.1% adapalene, which regulates cell turnover along the pores to reduce clogging, experts say. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing to pick to do for your acne, start using Differin gel at bedtime,\u201d says Jaber. Wash with a gentle cleanser, dry your skin fully and apply a pea size of Differin onto the entire face, according to the brand. Make sure to avoid using Differin Gel, as well as any other retinoid, as a spot treatment. \u201cThat would be way too irritating \u2014 it meant to be used all over [the face],\u201d says Gohara.\nBest spot treatment\nThis spot treatment is a favorite of both Gohara and Jaber, and can reduce the size and redness of acne in just two hours, according to the brand. It contains 10% benzoyl peroxide, which inhibits the growth of the bacteria that causes acne, experts told us.\nBest face wash\n\u201cFoam-based cleansers are [best] for those with oily skin,\u201d says Jaber, who recommends this one from CeraVe. The cleanser has 4% benzoyl peroxide to fight acne-causing bacteria, hyaluronic acid to preserve the skin\u2019s natural moisture and niacinamide, which helps to calm irritation, experts say. It\u2019s fragrance-free, noncomedogenic and can remove any excess oil, dirt or makeup from the skin, according to the brand.\nBest body wash\nThis Panoxyl face and body foaming wash has 10% benzoyl peroxide, the highest concentration available without a prescription. This was also one of Malin\u2019s favorites as a teen: \u201cIt helped reduce the frequency of breakouts, but since I have sensitive skin, I used it every other day instead of every day.\u201d It works to clean and unclog pores and contains moisturizing ingredients to help combat dryness, according to the brand.\nBest with salicylic acid\nThis expert-recommended acne face wash from Neutrogena has 2% salicylic acid to fight breakouts and remove dirt, oil, grime, impurities and bacteria from the skin, according to the brand. This was my go-to face wash when I was a teen because it stopped breakouts from forming and I noticed it made a huge difference when it came to clearing up existing bumps around my cheeks and forehead. The wash is also oil-free and noncomedogenic, so it\u2019s great for sensitive, oily skin. If you\u2019re using a salicylic acid cleanser for the first time, try using it every other day at first and eventually apply it daily depending on how your skin reacts, according to my experts.\nBest pimple patches\nPimple patches, which adhere to the skin and use hydrocolloid gel to absorb excess oil and dirt away from pimples, are great for both reducing the size of breakouts and preventing people from picking at and popping them, says Gohara. This Hero Cosmetics pimple patch won an NBC Select Wellness Award because it\u2019s translucent and easily blends into the skin, according to our reviewers. You can use these overnight or throughout the day, and the patch will turn white as it draws out the gunk and other sebum or debris from your pimples, according to the brand.\nBest overnight treatment\nThis quick-drying formula may be a good option for those looking to avoid benzoyl peroxide, experts say. It contains salicylic acid to fight acne and calamine to calm irritation, according to the brand. Simply dip a cotton swab into the pink sediment at the bottom of the bottle and dab it directly onto your pimple, according to the brand. The lotion dries quickly but leaves a pink, chalky residue, so the brand recommends using this product at night.\nBest retinoid gel\nOne of our favorite cystic acne treatments, this expert-recommended La Roche-Posay adapalene gel helps unclog pores, increase cell turnover and fight more severe acne. The gel is fragrance- and oil-free, according to the brand. Keep in mind adapalene can be irritating, so make sure to introduce this gel into your routine slowly (about once a week) to avoid redness and inflammation, according to my experts.\nBest foaming wash\nNoncomedogenic products like this La Roche-Posay face wash won\u2019t block pores, says Dr. Adnan Mir, assistant professor at New York Medical College and dermatopathologist at Dermpath Diagnostics in Port Chester, New York. This foaming cleanser is recommended by Gohara because it\u2019s both noncomedogenic and contains zinc pidolate, which has astringent, anti-inflammatory properties shown to improve acne.\nBest for sensitive skin\nAv\u00e9ne\u2019s gentle, no-rinse cleanser is formulated with vitamin E and hyaluronic acid, so it\u2019s hydrating enough to keep the skin barrier healthy, yet won\u2019t clog pores, says Gohara. It also works to remove makeup, dirt and oil and adds moisture back into the skin, according to the brand.\nBest exfoliating pads\nThese First Aid Beauty facial pads are made for sensitive skin because they can gently exfoliate using an alcohol-free (non-drying) formula, according to the brand. Recommended by Gohara, these pads have hyaluronic acid and white tea extract to hydrate and protect your skin. The brand recommends using this product in the morning and in the evening after cleansing and before moisturizing.\nTreating acne can be difficult, however, by finding the root cause \u2014 whether it be hormones, stress or genetics \u2014 you can find the best solution. According to experts, teen acne and pimples can be tackled in two ways: preemptive face-washing with appropriate cleansers and spot-treating breakouts.\nWash your face with a gentle, soap-free cleanser\nRemove any makeup before bed and wash your face every day \u2014 twice a day if you have oily skin or if your face gets dirty throughout the day, like after a workout, says Jaber.\nWhen it comes to face cleansers, look for gentle, noncomedogenic products, which means they won\u2019t block pores, says Mir. \u201cCleansers with ingredients like glycolic acid, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide can be very helpful for those with acne,\u201d says Jaber. \u201cBut be careful as they can be irritating and drying.\u201d\nSpot treat pimples\nAll three dermatologists I spoke to recommend spot treating pimples from the second they start to develop until they\u2019re just about gone. Look for a product containing a retinoid (a form of vitamin A that helps unclog pores), benzoyl peroxide (a topical antiseptic) or salicylic acid (an exfoliant that removes dead skin and unclogs pores), according to the experts.\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also take steps to ensure all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and without undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.\n- Dr. Adnan Mir is the former committee chair for the Society for Pediatric Dermatology. He is an assistant professor at New York Medical College and dermatopathologist at Dermpath Diagnostics in Port Chester, New York.\n- Dr. Mona Gohara is a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology Physicians of Connecticut.\n- Dr. Samer Jaber is a board-certified dermatologist and the founder of Washington Square Dermatology in New York City.\nI am an updates editor at NBC Select who has covered a variety of skin care topics, including products for rosacea, keratosis pilaris and cystic acne treatments. For this article, I spoke to three dermatologists to narrow down the best treatments for teen acne, and highlighted their recommendations for the best products to consider.\nCatch up on NBC Select\u2019s in-depth coverage of tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to stay up to date."

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As members of the National Guard deploy to the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's takeover of policing in Washington, members of the military are also set to take on prosecutorial roles handling civilian crimes.\nTwenty members of the Defense Department are set to begin working as special assistant U.S. attorneys \u2014 federal prosecutors \u2014 in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia next week, two people familiar with the matter told NBC News.\nTim Lauer, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, confirmed the move, saying members of the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps would be joining the office, though he did not know how long the detail would last.\nThe Trump administration has overhauled the Justice Department since January, shifting federal law enforcement resources toward immigration-related offenses, overhauling the Civil Rights Division and targeting career law enforcement officials involved in cases disfavored by the administration, including the two criminal cases against Trump.\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia is unique in that it prosecutes both federal crimes in U.S. District Court and local adult criminal offenses in D.C. Superior Court. The office led the charge in prosecuting members of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nA person familiar with the plans said that the 20 new employees were expected to work misdemeanor cases and that they would begin their training next week.\nSteven Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, noted that in 1983, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel said JAG lawyers could not serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys because it violated a statute barring military officers from exercising the duties of a civil office. But just a few months later, Congress authorized them to do so.\nU.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro recently told Fox News that her office is understaffed and needs 90 prosecutors, as well as 60 investigators and paralegals. The Trump administration has fired numerous federal prosecutors who worked on the Jan. 6 cases, contributing to the shortage.\n\"To the extent the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has a shortage of lawyers, this administration did itself no favors by firing qualified prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases and pushing out others by pursuing such an obviously political agenda,\" said former Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan Ballou, who worked on Jan. 6 cases. \"It sounds like the U.S. attorney is trying to import both staff and credibility; I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll work.\""

      "text": "The effects of Hurricane Erin sent seawater spilling over dunes and onto parts of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks Wednesday, swamping a highway on Hatteras Island where residents had been ordered to leave.\n\u201cI want to emphasize the importance of taking this storm seriously, because it\u2019s a serious storm and conditions can deteriorate quickly,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said at a news conference Wednesday.\nAt 11 p.m. the outer bands of the hurricane, a strong Category 2 storm with 110 mph winds, were bringing tropical storm conditions to or very near the North Carolina coast, the National Hurricane Center said.\nOfficials in North Carolina warned of waves of 15 to 20 feet, and the hurricane made swimming hazardous all along the East Coast, even though the center of the large storm will remain offshore.\nA tropical storm warning was in place from Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, to Chincoteague, Virginia. Highway 12 on Hatteras Island was \"completely submerged,\" the weather service said.\nFor Bermuda, the storm was traveling farther away than expected, lessening the impacts, the government said. But wind gusts could approach 60 mph Thursday into Friday, it said.\nStein declared a state of emergency to free up state resources, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said that emergency officials were prepared. Hurricane Erin will make its closest pass offshore Virginia early Thursday morning, he said.\nErin is a large hurricane and was projecting hurricane-force winds up to 105 miles from its center, and tropical storm-force winds up to 265 miles, the hurricane center said.\nThe storm is forecast to take a turn north-northeast Wednesday and move over the western Atlantic Ocean between the East Coast of the United States and Bermuda through Friday, before it passes south of Atlantic Canada into the weekend, the hurricane center said.\nErin will make its closest pass to the United States on Thursday, when the onshore winds will be strongest, leading to coastal flood concerns and dangerous rip currents. The heavy rain will remain offshore, so the strong winds will be the most noticeable impact.\nNorth Carolina expects coastal flooding from massive waves, tropical-storm-force winds and tidal and storm surges for much of the state shoreline, especially the Outer Banks, as well as life-threatening rip currents for most of the week, Stein said, adding, \"No one should be in the ocean.\"\nErin could strengthen Wednesday and Thursday, but it is expected to begin weakening by Friday, the hurricane center said.\n\"Regardless of the track of the center of the storm, dangerous conditions can be felt far from the eye, especially with the system as large as Erin, regardless of her track,\" North Carolina Emergency Management Director Will Ray said Wednesday.\nA storm surge warning is in effect from Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina, where 2 to 4 feet of storm surge flooding is possible along the coast, according to the hurricane center.\nIn addition, 1 to 2 inches of rain could hit the Outer Banks on Wednesday and Thursday.\nVideo from North Carolina shows major waves rolling onto land, flooding roads and beachfront homes.\nThere were 4 to 5 inches of standing water north of Hatteras Village at 9 a.m. Wednesday, the Dare County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook. Crews were working to build dunes in the area.\nThe hurricane's effects were being felt all along the East Coast, creating dangerous swells and rip currents, officials said. New York City and Long Island area beaches were closed to swimming, and New Jersey residents were told to stay out of the water.\n\"We've seen a high number of rescues along the coast, and you should avoid swimming anywhere on the North Carolina coast right now,\" Ray, the state's emergency management director, said.\nEvacuation orders have been implemented for Dare and Hyde counties in North Carolina, with shelters and recovery centers open across the state, Ray said. North Carolina has requested a major disaster declaration for public assistance from the federal government, which would provide additional recovery resources to those affected, he added.\nStein said Thursday, \"If you have not evacuated, make sure you batten down the hatches.\"\nThe National Weather Service in Jacksonville, Florida, also warned of dangerous surf conditions and rip tides Wednesday.\nIn New York City, the hurricane was forecast to cause coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet in vulnerable areas of Brooklyn and Manhattan, and Queens could see 2 1/2 feet, the emergency management department there said. The Bronx could also see 1 to 2 feet of coastal inundation, and basements could flood.\nStein on Wednesday warned against getting news about Hurricane Erin from social media as artificial intelligence misinformation floods channels.\n\"It is just too easy for salacious, really dramatic stories to take root and then and spread like wildfire, even in a hurricane, because that's what people click on,\" Stein said. \"If you see something on social media that sparks your interest, just go to a traditional website or news source and find out whether it's true.\""

      "text": "Hand soap has a basic but very necessary function: It needs to clean your hands and keep them free of bacteria. But one hand soap brand has just been recalled due to reports that it may actually be contaminated.\nDermaRite Industries LLC issued a voluntary recall of four hand soaps that they sell nationwide after a bacterium called Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) was detected. Below, we\u2019ve outlined everything you need to know about this recall \u2014 plus, hand soaps to use instead.\nOn August 9, the Food and Drug Administration published an announcement explaining that DermaRite Industries LLC had issued a recall of four products. The reason given was that a dangerous bacterium was discovered during testing.\nBurkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) was the bacterium that was detected in batches of four different products produced by DermaRite that were distributed across the United States and Puerto Rico. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says that Bcc is a group of bacteria most commonly found in dirt and soil. It can spread between people and cause lung infections. Those with compromised immune systems are particularly at risk when they come into contact with Bcc. The good news: DermaRite Industries says they have not received any reports of illness.\nThe following products from DermaRite were impacted by the recall:\n- DermaKleen (antiseptic lotion)\n- DermaSarra (analgesic cream)\n- KleanFoam (foam soap)\n- PeriGiene (perineal cleanser)\nIf you have one of the recalled products, you should stop using it immediately. If you have a recalled product, you can email voluntary.action@dermarite.com for next steps.\nOne of our favorite hand soaps, this formula is well under $3 and is aloe-scented. You can purchase larger bottles to refill the dispenser, and the bottles are recyclable. The soap also leaves hands feeling moisturized after washing, according to the brand.\nSimilar to some of the recalled products, this antiseptic cleanser can be used on your hands or anywhere else on the body where you need to be free from bacteria. The medical-grade cleanser is used in many hospitals and care centers. It comes with a pump and dispenses as a foam. It has no scent, making it a good option for those with sensitive skin.\nThis hand soap is EWG Verified, meaning that it meets strict safety and health standards set by the Environmental Work Group. It has a foam consistency and a light grapefruit scent. It is also free of artificial colors, mineral oil and petrolatum, according to the brand.\nBethany Heitman is a contributor at NBC Select and a journalist who regularly covers topics like beauty, home and lifestyle.\nCatch up on NBC Select\u2019s in-depth coverage of tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to stay up to date."

      "text": "LONDON \u2014 The Kremlin signaled Wednesday it was in no rush to agree to a leaders\u2019 summit with Ukraine and warned the West that talks over security guarantees for Kyiv were a \u201croad to nowhere\u201d without its involvement.\nMoscow\u2019s latest intervention came as the White House pressed ahead with arrangements for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while U.S. and NATO officials discussed how to ensure Ukraine\u2019s protection as part of an eventual peace deal with Russia.\nThe White House was actively looking to secure a meeting location and date, a senior administration official said Tuesday, adding that the Hungarian capital, Budapest, and the Swiss city of Geneva were among the sites discussed.\nBut the Kremlin appeared in no hurry for the pair to sit down together.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Putin had suggested continuing negotiations in his call with President Donald Trump on Monday and that Russia was ready to consider \u201craising the level of the heads of delegations.\u201d\nBut when it comes to meetings at the \u201chighest level,\u201d he said, \u201cthey must be prepared with the utmost care.\u201d\nA White House official said in a statement shared with NBC News on Wednesday that they were still working to arrange a bilateral meeting.\n\u201cPresident Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukrainian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war,\u201d the official said.\n\u201cAs many world leaders have stated, this war would have never happened if President Trump was in office. It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.\u201d\nSergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, told NBC News on Wednesday that talks can yield results only if Putin and Zelenskyy meet directly.\n\u201cWe need a person who is able to make the final decision. Lavrov is not that person. He was not responsible for starting this war. This war was started by Putin personally,\u201d Leshchenko said.\nHe added, \u201cZelenskyy wants to have direct negotiations with the one person who is able to make a decision and who is responsible for Russia\u2019s side of the war. That is not Lavrov or anyone else. The only person is Putin.\u201d\nMoscow also poured cold water on Western efforts to negotiate security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a peace deal with Russia.\nTrump promised during a meeting with European leaders in Washington on Monday that the U.S. would provide security guarantees as part of any settlement with Russia \u2014 a red-line issue for Kyiv. He made it clear Tuesday that that would not include U.S. \u201cboots on the ground\u201d but said it could mean the United States\u2019 providing air support as part of such an arrangement.\nMilitary chiefs from NATO\u2019s 32 member countries will meet virtually later Wednesday to discuss the way forward. U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, the head of U.S. European Command and NATO supreme Allied commander for Europe, will attend, the chair of NATO\u2019s military committee said. Their meeting comes after Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, hosted several European chiefs of defense Tuesday evening, a defense official told NBC News.\nLavrov said that Moscow was in favor of \u201ctruly reliable\u201d security guarantees for Ukraine but that any attempt to resolve the question of Ukraine\u2019s security without Russia was \u201ca utopia, a road to nowhere.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot agree with the idea that now it is proposed to resolve questions of security, collective security, without the Russian Federation,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cThat will not work.\u201d\nLavrov suggested security guarantees could be modeled on a draft accord Russia and Ukraine discussed in Istanbul in 2022, during the early weeks of the Kremlin\u2019s war. Ukraine rejected the proposal, arguing it would have given Moscow veto power over any military response to come to its aid.\nWest of Ukraine, an object that landed overnight in a field in eastern Poland was a Russian version of the Shahed drone, Poland\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson, Pawe\u0142 Wro\u0144ski, told Reuters on Wednesday.\nUkraine\u2019s neighbor has been on a high alert for objects entering its airspace since a stray Ukrainian missile killed two people in the village of Przewod\u00f3w in 2022.\nRussian airstrikes on Ukraine continued Tuesday night, killing three civilians and injuring dozens more across multiple regions, Ukrainian officials said.\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it had struck \u201cpier facilities\u201d used to supply fuel to Ukrainian forces.\nZelenskyy said on X that Russia had launched a strike \u201con a gas distribution station in the Odesa region.\u201d\nThe ongoing attacks illustrated \u201cthe need to put pressure on Moscow,\u201d he said, calling for \u201cnew sanctions and tariffs until diplomacy is fully effective.\u201d"

      "text": "Fresh data released this week underscored just how stuck the U.S. housing market is.\nOn Monday, a closely watched sentiment index of the companies that build U.S. houses returned to its 2\u00bd-year low. A day later, the Commerce Department reported that the number of new housing starts and permits for single-family homes had edged higher in July but were still near post-pandemic lows.\nHousing prices remain high, as do mortgage interest rates. Reasons for optimism are scarce.\n\u201cElevated mortgage rates continue to hold back sales of new homes, but the sharp further decline in homebuilders\u2019 confidence since the start of this year seems partly to reflect both a hit to consumers\u2019 confidence from the tariffs and slowing economy,\u201d Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research group, said in a note this week.\nBut even as President Donald Trump demands that the Federal Reserve cut its influential interest rates, economists are concerned that mortgage rates will remain elevated until the economy falters.\nEven after the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point last year \u2014 with more cuts likely this year \u2014 home borrowing costs have remained stubbornly high, said Lance Lambert, editor-in-chief and a co-founder of ResiClub, a housing analytics firm.\nIt would most likely take a dramatically worsening economy to materially lower mortgage rates, Lambert said.\n\u201cA really big move down would come from a scenario where unemployment shoots up and the economy deteriorates,\u201d he said.\nThe Federal Reserve can\u2019t unilaterally lower the cost of a home mortgage for consumers, because the interest rates it sets don\u2019t directly affect it. Still, Trump on Tuesday again called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower the central bank\u2019s key federal funds rate.\n\u201cCould somebody please inform Jerome \u2018Too Late\u2019 Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly?\u201d Trump wrote Tuesday evening on Truth Social. \u201cPeople can\u2019t get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut. \u2018Too Late\u2019 is a disaster!\u201d\nAnyone expecting lower rates from the Federal Reserve to provide much relief may end up disappointed. Mortgage rates are more closely tied to investor demand for longer-term government bonds like the 10-year Treasury note. When demand for those bonds increases, their interest rates, or yield, decline \u2014 and so do mortgage rates. Demand for such bonds is driven by a host of factors, including expectations about inflation and overall economic growth, as well as views of the government\u2019s fiscal health.\nSince Trump\u2019s re-election in November, the yield on the 10-year note hasn\u2019t changed much, though it has experienced large short-term swings, as in the wake of Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement in April. As of Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year note was about 4.3%. Similarly, there has been little change in mortgage rates over the same period: During the week of Election Day, the 30-year mortgage rate stood at 6.8%. Today, it\u2019s at 6.6%.\nThat rate reflects the general uncertainty Trump\u2019s mix of tariff, immigration and fiscal policies has created for the economy.\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association said last month that \u201ctrade and geopolitical uncertainty,\u201d as well as debt and deficit concerns, has continued to fuel concerns about demand for U.S. bonds, which are usually regarded as \u201csafe haven\u201d assets because the government\u2019s default risk is supposed to be zero. It cited Moody\u2019s downgrade of the United States\u2019 bond rating in May as reason for ongoing concerns about the government\u2019s ability to borrow, though a separate note this week from S&P reaffirmed the country\u2019s current credit rating.\nIn a statement, a White House spokesman said:\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people. As these historic trade deals and the Administration\u2019s pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\u201d\nA Fed move to lower its key rate would provide some relief to the market on the margin, said Robert Deitz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. Specifically, it would lower the cost of borrowing money for homebuilders seeking to embark on new projects.\n\u201cMonetary policy easing would help,\u201d he said.\nBut it\u2019s not clear buyers would emerge if more new homes hit the market. Homebuilders have gone to extremes to lure buyers. The homebuilders association reported Monday that the use of sales incentives was 66% in August, up from 62% in July and the highest percentage in the post-Covid period.\n\u201cThe challenges the housing market has suffered through for more than a decade are fundamentally about frictions in the market that\u2019s resulted in a structural housing deficit,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cLabor shortage, lack of lots, financing issues on the supply side, supply-chain issues, regulatory costs \u2014 they\u2019re all making it take longer and [be] more expensive to build a home.\u201d"

      "text": "A longtime ally, adviser and fundraiser for New York Mayor Eric Adams was suspended from his re-election effort after she attempted to hand a local journalist a cash-stuffed potato chip bag.\nWinnie Greco was outed by a local news organization, The City, for trying to give cash surreptitiously tucked inside a Herr's Sour Cream & Onion ripple potato chip bag to one of its City Hall reporters after a campaign event Wednesday afternoon in Harlem.\nAccording to the news outlet, the reporter, Katie Honan, initially refused the potato chips, which she believed to be a genuine snack offer, but Greco insisted. Upon discovering the wad of cash, which reportedly included at least one $100 bill and several $20 bills, she immediately contacted the Adams confidant to return the unwanted gift.\n\u201cI can\u2019t take this, when can I give it back to you,\" Honan texted Greco, to no response, according to The City.\nGreco later called the money offer \"a mistake\" and apologized profusely when The City contacted her about why she tried to give a reporter who covers Adams' administration a cash gift after an event meant to support his re-election. Greco, who is Chinese, said the act was \"a culture thing,\" a position her attorney supported in a statement to The City.\n\u201cI can see how this looks strange,\u201d Greco's attorney, Steven Brill, told The City. \u201cBut I assure you that Winnie\u2019s intent was purely innocent. In the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude. Winnie is apologetic and embarrassed by any negative impression or confusion this may have caused.\u201d\nTodd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams' mayoral campaign, said in a statement that \"Grecco [sic] holds no position in this campaign and has been suspended from all VOLUNTEER campaign-related activities.\"\n\u201cWe are shocked by these reports,\" Shapiro said, adding, \"Mayor Adams had no prior knowledge of this matter.\"\nGreco has been a close ally of Adams for more than a decade, serving as a conduit between the mayor and the city's Asian American communities and a top fundraiser for his campaigns and landing a role in his administration as director of Asian affairs. She resigned from that role last year, months after the FBI raided two of her properties as part of an investigation into a straw donations scheme in Adams' 2021 campaign.\nThe probe into the straw donations was one of several legal scandals surrounding Adams, whom federal prosecutors charged last year with abusing his position \"as this City\u2019s highest elected official, and before that as Brooklyn Borough President, to take bribes and solicit illegal campaign contributions.\" The Trump Justice Department later dismissed the charges.\nShapiro said Adams \"has always demanded the highest ethical and legal standards.\"\nRichard Kim, the editor in chief of The City, called Greco's cash gift \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\u201cThe fact that one of mayor Adams\u2019 closest, longtime advisors would attempt to ingratiate herself to any reporter, much less Katie Honan, with a cash gift is deeply disturbing and speaks to a rampant and blatant disregard for the role of a free and fair press,\" Kim said. \"The choice of sour cream and onion chips is also questionable.\u201d"

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is pushing for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to use an influx of funds to buy, own and operate its own fleet of airplanes to deport immigrants, two sources familiar with the discussions told NBC News. Former officials said that ICE owning and maintaining its own planes would be costly but could make it easier for the agency to potentially double the number of people it deports each month.\nICE uses charter planes to deport immigrants and has done so for years. The agency has typically chartered eight to 14 planes at a time for deportation flights, according to Jason Houser, who served as ICE chief of staff from 2022 to 2023. He said that allowed the Biden administration to deport roughly 15,000 immigrants per month on charter flights.\n\u201cIf the goal is to get to 30 to 35,000 removals a month, you would need to double the number of planes,\u201d Houser said, or purchase roughly 30 planes.\nWith a guaranteed set of 30 or more planes, ICE wouldn\u2019t be constrained by the limits of the companies it contracts with, which charter their planes to multiple clients.\nThe Trump administration has vowed to deport 1 million undocumented immigrants per year. ICE deported 100,000 to 150,000 in his first six months in office, according to internal data that includes voluntary self-departures in which immigrants left the U.S. on their own. The exact number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is disputed but is estimated to be in the millions.\nIt can cost $80 million to $400 million to buy a commercial airliner, according to aviation experts at the Pilot Institute, a company that trains pilots. Purchasing 30 passenger jets at that price range could cost $2.4 billion to $12 billion, but it\u2019s unclear if ICE could lower the price per plane by buying a large number of them.\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCharter companies are also responsible for maintaining the planes and making sure they comply with Federal Aviation Administration rules. If Noem creates the first ICE air fleet, the agency would then be responsible for staffing the planes with pilots, medics and security, as well as maintaining them and ensuring they comply with aviation regulations.\nThanks to $30 billion for ICE deportation efforts from President Donald Trump\u2019s spending law known as the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d Noem may have the funds to begin an airline and staff it accordingly. In all, the bill gave ICE over $75 billion, exponentially increasing its $9.5 billion annual budget.\nAnd as ICE rapidly increases the number of people it detains, Houser said, more deportations are needed to avoid overcrowding in detention centers.\nTom Cartwright, a private citizen who tracks ICE flights through planes\u2019 tail numbers, said ICE had chartered just over 1,000 flights from the U.S. by the end of July.\nEach of those flights costs roughly $25,000 per hour, according to a former senior ICE official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The $25,000 per hour covers the cost of the charter plane, pilots, flight attendants, security personnel and on-site medical personnel, the official said. When the charter planes are not being used by ICE, they are leased to other clients, including professional sports teams and political campaigns.\nHouser said he considered having ICE buy and operate its own planes during the Biden administration, but the agency did not have the funding. For each charter flight, he said, ICE paid $100,000 to $200,000.\n\u201cWe only ever had 13 to 14 planes because of the amount of money and resources,\u201d Houser said."

      "text": "By the time she graduated high school, the back pain that Nala White first noticed at age 13 had radiated to her left leg, creating an unbearable sensation of pins and needles. The mere act of standing at her graduation ceremony was excruciating.\n\u201cI had to sit there and dig my nails into my palms and just bear through it,\u201d White said.\nAt home, a simple walk from her bedroom to the kitchen brought her to tears. And a trip to the mailbox down the street would cause her leg to burn, forcing White to crouch or sit for relief.\nRead more on this story at NBCNews.com and watch \u201cNBC Nightly News with Tom Llamas\u201d tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\nThe 18-year-old from Austin, Texas, was diagnosed three years ago with degenerative disc disease, the same condition her mother developed as a teenager. Most people develop the condition as spinal discs wear down naturally with age, but early onset can run in families.\nIn severe cases, spine surgery is often the best option to alleviate the debilitating pain and numbness that are hallmarks of the disease. Multiple doctors recommended that White get surgery to remove part of the bone that was compressing her nerves.\nHowever, her insurance company, Aetna, twice refused to cover the surgery, saying it was \u201cnot medically necessary.\u201d Doctors who treat degenerative disc disease say it\u2019s an all-too-common scenario.\nWhite\u2019s predicament comes at a time of growing animosity against insurance companies over denied claims or pre-authorization requests, which require an insurer to sign off on a medical service before it happens. A 2023 survey from Premier, a health care data and consulting company, found that nearly 15% of claims submitted to private insurance companies are initially denied, and more than half of denials are overturned, usually after multiple appeals. Frustrations with insurance companies grew louder last year following the killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, which is widely suspected to have been motivated by grievances with the health insurance industry.\n\u201cSpine surgery tends to be one of the more likely things to be denied,\u201d said Dr. Anthony DiGiorgio, an assistant professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in White\u2019s care.\nDiGiorgio said the surgeries can be particularly expensive (up to $35,000 in some cases without insurance). And because degenerative disc disease is common, he said, doctors can sometimes over-recommend surgery when other interventions like physical therapy would suffice. Even then, doctors might not always agree on what approach is best.\nSome people with degenerative disc disease may have no symptoms at all. A 2015 analysis found that 37% of 20-year-olds and 96% of 80-year-olds who did not have back pain had some degree of disc degeneration. For others, the back, neck or leg pain is so severe they have trouble walking or performing daily activities.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gray zone decision-making in spine surgery,\u201d DiGiorgio said. \u201cYou could show a patient presentation, an MRI, to five spine surgeons and get 10 different answers.\u201d\nDr. Randall Dryer, an orthopedic surgeon at Central Texas Spine Institute who treated White but did not perform her surgery, said doctors often have to make a convincing case to insurance companies.\n\u201cThe insurance companies refuse to accept the fact that surgery for degenerative disease is effective. They will say it\u2019s because the medical literature doesn\u2019t support it, but they take cherry-picked articles that support their case, and they tend to downplay other literature that would indicate that surgical treatment is effective,\u201d Dryer said.\nAn Aetna spokesperson pointed NBC News to two published analyses that found no clear benefits from spine surgery over a nonsurgical intervention. But other studies have shown that spine surgery is superior to nonsurgical treatments, such as physical therapy or injections, and reduces a patient\u2019s disability.\nWhite\u2019s father, Wrath James White, is the policyholder for her insurance plan. He said he was shocked to receive a letter from Aetna saying their request for coverage had been denied.\n\u201cI had never had insurance reject a legitimate claim before, and my daughter\u2019s pain seemed about as legitimate as you can get,\u201d he said.\nWhen his daughter was diagnosed, the family tried less invasive approaches than surgery such as physical therapy, steroid injections and anti-inflammatory pills. But it became clear to them \u2014 and to White\u2019s doctors \u2014 that spine surgery was the only option to alleviate her pain.\n\u201cI did everything I possibly could for four years to avoid doing surgery on her,\u201d Dryer said. He noted in a 2022 report that White was \u201cmiserable\u201d and \u201cI could significantly improve the patient\u2019s condition with a simple decompression and discectomy,\u201d referring to surgical procedures to remove compression on her nerves.\nIf you are dealing with bills that seem to be out of line or a denial of coverage, care or repairs, whether for health, home or auto, please email us at Costofdenial@nbcuni.com.\nA report from White\u2019s surgeon in April said she had \u201cfailed multiple rounds of physical therapy and pain management and as such I feel she has reached a point for surgical intervention.\u201d\nWhite\u2019s parents ultimately decided to set up a GoFundMe to raise money for the surgery. In a matter of days, they received more than $33,000 in donations \u2014 close to the amount they were quoted for White\u2019s surgery, including hospital fees, anesthesiology and doctor\u2019s fees.\nWrath James White said he believes a lot of those donations were \u201csmall and silent protests.\u201d\nWhite underwent surgery on July 18. NBC News reached out to Aetna on July 31 to inquire about why her coverage was denied. Aetna said in an email the following day that it had approved coverage for White\u2019s surgery on Aug. 1 \u201cbased on additional documentation provided by Ms. White\u2019s surgeon.\u201d The family said they are expecting a $3,700 reimbursement for the doctor\u2019s fee from Aetna, but have not heard back about additional reimbursements.\n\u201cThe system does not work,\u201d Wrath James White said. \u201cIt is not designed to get people healthy.\u201d\nDiGiorgio, the California surgeon, believes it\u2019s important for insurance companies to publicly disclose their requirements for covering spine surgery, so doctors know what to submit for pre-authorization. (Aetna does so on its website.)\nSome insurers, such as UnitedHealthcare and Highmark, have also implemented \u201cgold carding\u201d programs, which allow surgeons with a track record of good decision-making to bypass the pre-authorization process. DiGiorgio said that could help speed up approvals for spine surgery. Texas, where White lives, passed a \u201cgold card\u201d law in 2021 that exempts providers from needing pre-authorization if they have at least a 90% approval rate on past pre-authorization requests. But the law does not apply to certain insurance plans, such as Medicaid or self-funded employer plans.\nIn White\u2019s case, the surgery was life-changing. Her body is still healing, but she said her leg pain is gone. She starts community college next week \u2014 a dream she wasn\u2019t sure was possible before surgery.\n\u201cNow I\u2019m hopeful I can live normally, just be happy,\u201d she said."

      "text": "In recent weeks, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has levied mortgage fraud allegations against three Democratic officials.\nThe latest came Wednesday, when Trump, who has been sharply critical of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies, posted to his Truth Social platform that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook \u201cmust resign, now!!!\u201d\nHis post came after William Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi that Cook, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, \u201cfalsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud.\u201d Pulte\u2019s letter claimed that Cook falsified her residence statuses for her properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta.\nThe move followed recent efforts targeting Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was a leading figure in Trump\u2019s impeachments, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully sued Trump and his company over what her office said were fraudulent misrepresentations of his wealth and financial statements that he used to get favorable rates on bank loans and insurance policies that he otherwise would not have been able to obtain.\nA judge awarded James\u2019 office over $300 million in the case, an amount that has since ballooned to over $500 million with interest. Trump has called the case \u201ca fraud on me\u201d and is appealing the judgment.\nThis month, NBC News reported that Bondi appointed Ed Martin, a conservative activist and former interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., as a \u201cspecial attorney\u201d to probe mortgage fraud allegations against Schiff and James. At the time, a senior law enforcement official told NBC News that a grand jury in Virginia will investigate the allegations against James, while a grand jury in Maryland will take up the Schiff allegations. Trump had called for both officials to be prosecuted over the allegations.\nSchiff, James and now Cook have all denied any wrongdoing. The White House referred questions to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which declined to comment.\nMaking an allegation of mortgage fraud has long been a common tactic in opposition research on political campaigns.\nA Republican campaign veteran told NBC News that searching for inconsistencies in where candidates declare their \u201cprimary\u201d residences is among the first tasks for opposition researchers. It is an issue relevant to elected officials who split their time between their home states and Washington. This person said it is a frequent issue in campaigns on both sides, and the penalty tends to be a fine, not jail time.\nLast year, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., then a candidate for office, faced a $47,000 bill in Washington, D.C., after it was discovered she wrongly received property tax credits she improperly claimed on a home she had rented out.\n\u201cIt looks sloppy,\u201d this person said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had anyone screw up their life on this. It just looked bad.\u201d\nNow, the Trump administration is giving such allegations against Democrats special attention.\nAt the same time, The Associated Press reported that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Trump ally who is running for the Senate, and his wife, Angela, made inaccurate statements on mortgage applications claiming that three separate properties were each their primary residence. The Trump administration has not said whether Paxton is under similar investigation.\nIn a letter to Martin on Monday, James\u2019 lawyer, Abbe Lowell, pointed out the potential inconsistency in enforcement actions.\n\u201cNotably, absent from your mandate is Kenneth Paxton (Republican Attorney General of Texas). Given that the same news reports raising questions about Ms. James and Mr. Schiff have reported that, somehow, Mr. Paxton has three different properties that he claims to be his \u2018primary residence,\u2019 it seems to indicate your title ought really be, \u2018Special Assistant for Mortgage Fraud [Alleged Against Democrats Adverse to President Trump],\u2019\u201d he wrote.\nPulte said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that the administration\u2019s probes of the allegations of mortgage fraud were free from political considerations.\n\u201cWe will look at any allegation of mortgage fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we do not care whether you\u2019re a Republican, a Democrat. We do not care whether you\u2019re wealthy. We don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a prosecutor. We don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a Fed governor, if you commit mortgage fraud and you present an existential threat to the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie or Freddie, we are going to prosecute it, period.\u201d\nCook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, said in a statement Wednesday that she learned from news reports that Pulte had made a criminal referral against her \u201cbased on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\u201cI have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\u201d she said. \u201cI do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\u201d\nLater Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said the episode amounted to the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s trying to pressure the Federal Reserve.\n\u201cI\u2019ve long been an advocate for holding Fed officials accountable,\u201d Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. \u201cBut anyone can see that for months now, President Trump has been scrambling for a pretext to intimidate or fire Chair Powell and Members of the Federal Reserve Board while blaming anyone but himself for how his failed economic policies are hurting Americans. The President and his Administration should not weaponize the Federal government to illegally fire independent Fed Board members.\u201d"

      "text": "Erik and Lyle Menendez are taking another step on what could be their path to freedom.\nThe brothers, who have served more than three decades in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents, will appear before California parole officials Thursday and Friday in a bid to convince the panel that they are suitable for release.\nA Los Angeles judge found three months ago that the men do not pose an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d and resentenced them to 50 years to life \u2014 a decision that effectively canceled their previous prison terms of life without the possibility of parole and made them eligible for \"suitability\" hearings immediately.\nErik, 54, will appear before the board Thursday. Lyle, 57, will appear Friday.\nCommissioners will weigh possible testimony from victims\u2019 relatives and prosecutors, and they will consider a range of factors, including the brothers\u2019 criminal histories, their behavior while they were incarcerated and their release plans.\nIf they are found suitable for parole, a review process that can take nearly a half-year follows. The decision to release the brothers will ultimately land with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has 30 days to affirm, reverse or modify the decision or refer it back to the parole board.\nNewsom, whose office oversaw a separate and still-pending clemency application from the brothers, has declined to comment on what he would do if the board recommends parole.\nThe brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 after two trials that spanned three years. They claimed they killed their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez, in self-defense after years of abuse at their father\u2019s hands.\nProsecutors have disputed those claims and pointed to the grim specifics of the killings \u2014 Lyle reloaded his shotgun before he shot his mother in the face, for example \u2014 and they described the killings as ruthless and financially motivated.\nSpeaking at the resentencing hearing, Erik described his crimes as \u201ccruel and vicious\u201d and said he was \u201cdirectly responsible for it all.\u201d\nTheir case was catapulted back into the spotlight after a pair of streaming series and advocacy from some high-profile figures and relatives. The effort to secure their release has highlighted the sometimes complicated debate over rehabilitation versus incarceration.\nMany family members have been outspoken advocates for the brothers\u2019 freedom. After their resentencing hearing in May, a cousin, Anamaria Baralt, attributed the judge\u2019s decision to the brothers\u2019 growth behind bars and the \u201cpurpose of service\u201d that she said they exhibited.\nAmong other things, the brothers have attended college, established a \u201cbeautification\u201d project at the San Diego prison where they are incarcerated and helped inmates with severe disabilities, court filings show.\nBaralt said she expected the parole process to be difficult on the brothers\u2019 family but added: \u201cWe will eagerly step through those doors if that means getting them home.\u201d\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office has had different views on the brothers\u2019 push for freedom. Weeks before his ouster last year, the county\u2019s former top prosecutor, George Gasc\u00f3n, said the siblings had been \u201cexceptional\u201d inmates and recommended that they be resentenced.\nHis successor, Nathan Hochman, tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to withdraw that recommendation. He said the siblings had not taken responsibility for more than a dozen lies he said they told about the murders, including the claim that they killed their parents in self-defense.\n\u201cThe Menendez brothers have never fully accepted responsibility for the horrific murders of their parents, instead continuing to promote a false narrative of self-defense that was rejected by the jury decades ago,\" Hochman said in a statement ahead of the hearings.\n\"We have consistently opposed their release at this time because they have not demonstrated full insight into their crimes or shown that they have been fully rehabilitated, and therefore continue to pose a risk to society,\" he said.\nRepresentatives from his office will attend the hearing, he has said, and their level of participation will be determined by the parole board.\nIf their parole is denied, the brothers still have their clemency application with the governor's office. And they have sought to have their convictions overturned through a separate process that continues."

Economists warn that the tariffs, a tax on goods paid by importing companies, are fueling persistent inflation. The Trump administration has touted tens of billions of dollars in revenue from the duties.\nIn a statement, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, \"Faced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our Member States and industry, and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade.\"\nThe E.U. also stressed that \"tariffs are paid by the company importing the imported goods.\"\n\"In the end, it is usually the consumers (in this case, US consumers) who will indirectly pay for the tariffs.\"\nIn the framework E.U. trade agreement, the United States said it plans to roll back tariffs on \u201cunavailable natural resources (including cork), all aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors\u201d to pre-January levels starting Sept. 1.\nEuropean Commissioner for Trade Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said \"this framework is the first step, one that can grow over time\" to include further exemptions.\nOne of the most important exemptions sought by the E.U. for the wine and spirits industry did not make it into Thursday's agreement. \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said \"unfortunately here we didn't succeed,\" but added that he would continue to discuss it with his American counterparts.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a post on X, \"The America First Trade Agenda has secured the most important trading partner creating a major win for American workers, U.S. industries, and our national security.\"\nIreland, an E.U. member state, is one of the top sources of pharmaceutical imports for the United States. The pre-January tariff rate on aircraft imports was zero. The European Union, as a whole, is the United States' largest trading partner.\nIrish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin said he welcomed today's agreement. In a statement, he said: \"Given the scale of the pharmaceutical and semiconductor sectors in Ireland, it is important that the Joint Statement confirms that 15% is a ceiling\" for those tariffs.\n\"While I have been clear all along that I do not support tariffs, this is a significant win for the E.U.\"\nThe deal includes a promise from the E.U. to buy energy and artificial intelligence technology from the United States.\n\u201cThe European Union intends to procure U.S. liquified natural gas, oil, and nuclear energy products with an expected offtake valued at $750 billion through 2028. In addition, the European Union intends to purchase at least $40 billion worth of U.S. AI chips for its computing centers,\u201d the statement reads. That echoes what Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced last month when they first announced the contours of the deal.\nThe announcement also says, \u201cEuropean companies are expected to invest an additional $600 billion across strategic sectors in the United States through 2028.\u201d\nTrump has framed the dollar figures for Europe\u2019s energy and investment intentions as firm commitments, but the document the United States and the E.U. agreed to clearly says they are only expectations spanning the next three years. But Trump touted the deal to CNBC in early August as \"a gift\" that the United States does not have to pay back.\nTrump added that any government that did not follow through with the promised investments or purchases would immediately face higher tariffs.\n\u201cThe details are $600 billion to invest in anything I want,\u201d he said on CNBC.\nThe E.U.\u2019s blanket \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff will remain 15% as part of the announcement. That rate already took effect on Aug. 7. The United States also plans to reduce auto tariffs on European imports, but only after the E.U. introduces legislation to lower its industrial tariffs.\nA senior administration official told NBC News that introducing the legislation would be enough to enact the lower auto tariffs. The European Commission said it plans to introduce that legislation as soon as possible. Trade commissioner \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d also said that U.S. told him the lower auto tariffs would be retroactive to Aug. 1.\nThe two sides also say they plan to cooperate on restrictions other countries have imposed on critical mineral exports and work together on digital trade barriers."
