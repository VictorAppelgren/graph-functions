  "title": "4 apps you should use instead of Google News",
  "description": "If you're tired of Google News, consider switching to one of these four apps. I tried them all but have a favorite.",
  "content": "While Google News is a popular choice, its user interface and limited customization options might not be for everyone. I used the app for a long time, but I eventually moved on to something better. After trying countless alternatives, I found a few that offer a more personalized and streamlined experience.\n\nSome of these apps provide a highly tailored experience, while others let you get to the gist of a story much faster. While I\u2019ve listed my favorite first, the others are all excellent in their own way.\n\nThis is the Google News alternative I recommend to most people, though I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s not for everyone. The two apps are very different in their approach. Google News is a news aggregator that uses algorithms to show you what it thinks you\u2019ll like, while Feedly is an RSS reader that puts you in complete control.\n\nTo get the most out of Feedly, you have to do a little upfront work. You\u2019ll create feeds based on topics and then add the specific sources you want to follow. For example, I have feeds set up for technology, investing, and entrepreneurship, and I\u2019ve added all the sources I trust to each one. This lets me skip media outlets I don\u2019t like for various reasons, ensuring they never show up in my feed.\n\nI also appreciate Feedly\u2019s other features, like the ability to save articles to read later and the option to mark entire feeds as read to clear out older content. Plus, I can create boards to save articles for specific reasons \u2014 like those I want to revisit and read more than once. The free version of Feedly offers plenty, but there\u2019s a premium option starting at $8 a month for users who need more features, such as AI-powered article summarization and advanced content filtering.\n\nBefore switching to Feedly, I was a dedicated Flipboard user. I really love its user interface; it\u2019s clean, simple, and very visually engaging. Flipboard\u2019s unique magazine-style layout lets me flip through pages of content instead of just scrolling \u2014 although this is also an option \u2014 which makes for a more immersive reading experience.\n\nFlipboard is a hybrid between a traditional news aggregator and a curated reader.\n\nFor me, Flipboard is a great hybrid between a traditional news aggregator and a curated reader. There are \u201cmagazines\u201d available for specific topics, and I can personalize them by selecting subtopics I\u2019m interested in. I can also create my own magazines to share with others. The For You section is great for discovering the most popular stories from all my magazines, and the Explore tab helps me find new stories and sources with trending topics and various categories.\n\nInoreader is very similar to Feedly since it\u2019s also an RSS reader. However, it\u2019s more feature-packed and customizable, making it a better choice for power users. The free tier is also quite generous compared to Feedly\u2019s, offering up to 150 feeds and unlimited folders.\n\nThere are more than enough customization options to make Inoreader suit your personal preferences. For instance, I really like being able to choose how articles are displayed in my feed. You can select from different layouts, including a list, card, or magazine view. I typically go for the magazine style because it looks the best to me and isn\u2019t too cluttered, but your mileage may vary.\n\nI also love the option to mark all posts as read so they don\u2019t show up in my feed again. This is especially useful for older news I haven\u2019t gotten around to yet and no longer need to see.\n\nI used Ground News for a while and really liked it because of its unique approach. The setup process is quick and interesting; I had to select my preferred edition (US, Europe, International, etc.) and a few topics of interest.\n\nWhat makes Ground News truly different is its focus on media bias. It allows you to compare how different news sources from across the political spectrum cover the same story, making it easier to find unbiased news. For example, for a major political story, Ground News will show you all the articles in one place, sorted by their perceived political slant \u2014 left, center, or right. This not only helps you see different perspectives but also lets you know if the coverage is balanced or if it\u2019s being heavily reported by just one side.\n\nGround News is not an app for everyone, as some people don\u2019t dig that deep into media outlets\u2019 biases and just want to get the latest info from a trusted source. But for those who want to see the full picture, it\u2019s a fantastic tool.\n\nThese are four of the best Google News alternatives I\u2019ve used personally and highly recommend. Of course, there are so many other options out there. I haven\u2019t tried all of them, so let me know which ones you think are great and why in the comments.",

Learn more.\n10 best news apps for Android\nApril 3, 2025\nOver the past two decades or so, the internet has transformed how we access news, freeing us from the biases of traditional TV and newspaper editors. To help you navigate the overwhelming number of news sources, we\u2019ve compiled a list of the best news apps for Android. We prioritize unbiased, crowd-sourced platforms over politically driven networks like CNN or Fox News.\nAdditionally, Google\u2019s official app deserves mention \u2014 the Discover feed quickly adapts to your interests, offering a convenient and personalized news experience. A similar feature is also available within Chrome\u2019s mobile app.\nThe best news apps for Android\nAP News\nPrice: Free with ads\nAP News is a reasonably decent news app for Android. It sources its news from itself and hundreds of local and nationwide sources. The user interface is clean, and you can find news on various topics, including sports, entertainment, travel, technology, and more. It\u2019s not the best for politics, but better than most. The app is entirely free of ads. The ads are a bit annoying, but it\u2019s nothing too serious.\nFeedly\nPrice: Free / Pro $7.99 per month / Pro+ $15.99 per month\nFeedly is one of the most popular news apps out there. It\u2019s an RSS reader. That means you can pull from a variety of sites and sources. The goal is to build your news network from places that you trust. It integrates with Facebook, IFTTT, Twitter, Evernote, OneNote, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and others. Additionally, you can access your feed on your mobile phone or your computer through their website. It\u2019s a rock-solid option with over 40 million feeds in total. The only downside is the advertising. It\u2019s a little heavy unless you pay the subscription price.\nPrice: Free\nFlipboard is another one of the more popular news apps. It works a lot like Feedly. You can create a custom feed with your favorite news sources, sites, and other places. Flipboard differs from Feedly in that it is a little more flashy. It includes fun animations, large images, and a user interface that makes it look like a digital magazine. It also has additional features for things like discovery. It\u2019s also completely free.\nNewsBreak\nPrice: Free\nThe News Break app helps you access the latest and most relevant news stories. It offers a personalized newsfeed and delivers tailored updates on topics you care about. Its user-friendly interface makes browsing articles, videos, and local news easy, keeping you informed and connected. News Break also provides real-time notifications, ensuring you never miss breaking news. This comprehensive news app is your go-to source for staying up-to-date with the world\u2019s events.\nPrice: Free / $4.99 per month / $44.99 per year\nPocket is one of the more unique news apps. It doesn\u2019t offer content. However, it will save whatever content you stumble across during your day. You\u2019ll no doubt find something on Twitter or Facebook or in a chat you can\u2019t read right now. You can stuff that into a Pocket and then come back to read it later. It has offline support, a decent reading experience, and discovery features. Power users can sign up for a subscription. It offers unlimited storage, a tag system to help stay organized, text-to-speech article reading, and additional features for PC.\nPodcast Addict\nPrice: Free\nPodcast Addict is an excellent all-in-one solution for news apps. It is a combination of an RSS reader and a podcast app. It boasts a collection of 450,000 podcasts. Additionally, you can subscribe to almost any news source that you like. The app supports podcast playlists, categorically organized news feeds, Chromecast support, and YouTube and Twitch channels. Better podcast apps (Castbox, Pocket Casts, Doggcatcher, etc.) and better RSS apps (Feedly and Flipboard) exist. However, nothing does a combination of the two better than this one.\nPrice: Free / $5.99 per month / $49.99 per year\nReddit bills itself as the front page of the Internet. That\u2019s at least mostly true. Most trending news items end up somewhere on Reddit. You can subscribe to subreddits that let you see various interests. You can find a subreddit for virtually anything from fashion to tech, Android to iOS, and everything in between. The official app is good enough at its job. It doesn\u2019t have many power-user features. However, it nails the essential experience very well. Overall, it\u2019s one of the better news apps and communities. The optional monthly subscription adds a few additional features and removes ads.\nX\nPrice: Free\nX (formerly known as Twitter) is easily one of the best known social media platforms, especially for news. It\u2019s one of only a few platforms that still show posts in chronological order. Thus, it\u2019ll show you what\u2019s happening right now. It has hashtags, trending topics, and some other discovery features. You follow the sources you like. Your feed will then show their latest posts.\nUnfortunately, X has changed significantly since Musk acquired it, and the platform doesn\u2019t appeal to the same audience as well as it once did. X harbors a mix of users, including less-than-ideal individuals, along with numerous provocative blogs and posters aiming to stoke anger. Misinformation also runs rampant. Nonetheless, X can be a helpful newsreader for those who discern credible sources and sift through the noise. Following trusted news outlets and reading between the lines becomes a valuable platform for staying informed.\nYour local news apps\nPrice: Free (usually)\nYour local news apps are usually not half bad. They focus more on things happening around your community. Most people focus on the worldwide news and, in doing so, lose track of what\u2019s happening in their cities. Generally, these apps are simple. They show the news and sometimes even the weather. On top of TV stations, many towns will also have local newspapers with apps. For instance, the Columbus Dispatch has its own app. Sometimes, these apps are great. Sometimes, they\u2019re not.\nIf we missed any of the best news apps for Android, tell us about them in the comments.\nThank you for being part of our community.
