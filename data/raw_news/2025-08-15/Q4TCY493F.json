  "title": "Lauren Sanchez Bezos Is Left 'Heartbroken' After Son Evan Moves Out of Family Home To Start 'His Next Chapter' at College",
  "description": "Sanchez Bezos, who wed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in June, has opened up about another major life milestone.",
  "content": "It's been a summer of major life milestones for Lauren Sanchez Bezos, who began the season by tying the knot with billionaire Jeff Bezos-and she is closing it out by bidding farewell to her son, Evan Whitesell, who has left the family home to start his freshman year at college.\n\n\"Dropped off Evan at college today,\" she wrote, while sharing a picture of the teenager assembling furniture in his new dorm room. \"18 years of early mornings, late night snacks, and family dinners ... and then there he was building his own dorm cabinet.\n\nThe update comes eight months after Sanchez Bezos proudly revealed on Instagram that her son had been accepted by the University of Miami, where she hinted that the teenager had plans to study business at the institution's Herbert Business School.\n\nMeanwhile Bezos has four children with his former spouse, MacKenzie Scott-three sons and a daughter who was adopted from China; however, only their eldest son, Preston, has had his name shared publicly.\n\nIt appears that the newlywed couple carefully timed their weekslong honeymoon to ensure that they could be present when Evan headed off to college, having been spotted partying the night away in Ibiza just days before moving him into his Miami dorm room.\n\nFortunately for Sanchez Bezos, her son is not straying far from the family nest-which is located on the exclusive enclave of Indian Creek Island, regularly referred to as Miami's \"Billionaire Bunker,\" where they count the likes of Tom Brady, and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner as neighbors.\n\nThough Bezos had spent many years based out of the tony Seattle suburb of Medina, he and Sanchez Bezos announced in 2023 that they were moving their primary residence to Florida, explaining at the time that the Amazon founder wished to be closer to his parents.\n\nAccording to a report by CNBC, the businessman stands to save \"at least $610 million\" in taxes that he would have had to pay if he were still living full time in Washington state.\n\nStill, Bezos has built himself quite the impressive compound on Indian Creek Island, where he is said to own three separate dwellings that he snapped up over several years.\n\nAll three deals were conducted via separate trusts, property records show, and only one of the homes had been publicly listed for sale before being snapped up by Bezos, with two of the deals taking place off market.\n\nAccording to reports, the third property will be used by Bezos and his now-wife as their primary residence while workers raze the other two homes to make way for the couple's dream marital compound.\n\nHowever the couple has plenty of other homes in their expansive portfolio that they can reside in if they need a break from their temporary Florida residence-including a collection of homes that Bezos still owns in Medina.\n\nFour years after he founded Amazon, Bezos spent $10 million, along with now-ex-wife Scott, buying up two homes that sit on a 5-acre plot in the town of Hunts Point. In 2010, the duo reportedly spent $28 million to extensively renovate the estate, which boasts 310 feet of private shoreline and a private boathouse.",
