  "content": "Gemini\u2019s revenue fell and losses widened in the first half of 2025, the cryptocurrency exchange said in a US IPO filing, joining a wave of digital-asset firms seeking to tap public markets.\n\nTerms of the offering were not disclosed in the filing, made public on Friday.\n\nThe company reported a net loss of $282.5 million on a total revenue of $68.6 million in the six months ended June 30, compared with a net loss of $41.4 million on a revenue of $74.3 million year earlier.\n\nUS IPO activity has rebounded in recent months following a slowdown earlier this year caused by uncertainty over trade policy changes, with several new listings drawing strong investor demand.\n\nDigital asset companies have also featured prominently in the IPO market in recent months, including blockbuster debuts from stablecoin issuer Circle and cryptocurrency exchange Bullish.\n\nBullish\u2019s debut on Wednesday made it the second listed cryptocurrency exchange in the country after Coinbase Global. Gemini will become the third public crypto exchange once it goes public.\n\n\u201cThe question for investors regarding Gemini revolves around the business mix and moat of trading versus custody, how they differentiate on trust and growth, and what they do that Coinbase can\u2019t copy by Tuesday,\u201d said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital.\n\nGemini said it will use IPO proceeds for general corporate purposes and to repay all or part of its third-party debt.\n\nThe exchange also supports stablecoins on its platform, a segment that has drawn attention following last month\u2019s signing of the GENIUS Act, a new US law establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins.\n\nGemini issues the Gemini Dollar (GUSD), a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.\n\nThe company, which also supports more than 70 cryptocurrencies and operates in over 60 countries, confidentially filed for an IPO in June.\n\nGemini, which was founded in 2014 by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, plans to list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \u201cGEMI.\u201d Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are acting as lead bookrunners.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins rose to prominence after suing Facebook, and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, alleging he stole their idea for the social network. They settled in 2008 for cash and Facebook stock.\n\nRegulatory clarity under the Trump administration, rising institutional adoption, and increasing ETF inflows have bolstered investor confidence and helped integrate crypto into mainstream finance.\n\nIn a watershed moment for the industry, Coinbase became the first blockchain-focused company to join the S&P 500 earlier this year. Block, which facilitates bitcoin purchases, joined the index in July.\n\nThe shift marks a turnaround for an industry that spent more than a decade under heavy regulatory scrutiny worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a shift from speculation to sustainability. Institutional investors are looking for proof points \u2013 real clients, regulated products, and long-term market alignment. This is how the sector matures, and it will likely set the stage for other crypto firms keen to list their shares,\u201d said Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo.",

      "text": "Crypto market cap surges past $4 trillion on landmark GENIUS Act law\nThe total market value of crypto assets surged past the $4 trillion mark for the first time ever on the back of landmark legislation to regulate the industry \u2013 marking a milestone that reflects its shift from a nascent asset class to a central part of the global investment landscape.\nThe surge came as President Trump on Friday signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first-ever federal law to regulate stablecoins \u2014 a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a real-world asset.\nThe law \u2014 passed after a bruising battle in Congress \u2014 introduces federal or state oversight of stablecoins tied to the US dollar in a move that helps legitimize a market that has been left largely unregulated.\nCitigroup analysts have estimated that the stablecoin market could grow to $3.7 trillion by 2030.\n\u201cAnyone who has never invested before, I\u2019m not sure this is the best level to be buying crypto at the moment and in fact I would say the other way,\u201d Ken Mahoney, chief executive of Mahoney Asset Management, told The Post.\n\u201cIf you have some decent profits, it\u2019s always good to sell it off incrementally.\u201d\nThe market cap record was driven by a rally in altcoins, a term used to refer to all tokens beside Bitcoin.\nEther jumped nearly 20% over the past five days to trade at around $3,500 as of 5:30 p.m. ET, while benchmark Bitcoin hit a record $123,205 earlier this week. The world\u2019s most popular digital token was trading at around $117,000 at 5:30 p.m. ET.\nUniswap soared 20% on Friday and Solana, known for its meme coins, gained 5.6%.\nInvestors have been pouring into crypto ETFs in anticipation of \u201cCrypto Week,\u201d hopeful that Trump\u2019s signature on the bills could help cryptocurrency shake its reputation as a contrarian asset.\nBitcoin funds have seen $5.5 billion inflows so far in July. Ether ETFs have brought in $2.9 billion.\n\u201cThe Genius Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class,\u201d said Chris Perkins, president, CoinFund.\nMahoney cautioned that the crypto market will likely cool off after the legislation has finished working its way through headlines, as \u201ceverything runs its course and runs hot at some point.\u201d\nThe House on Thursday also passed two broader bills related to cryptocurrency that are awaiting Senate consideration.\nThe Digital Asset Market Clarity Act installs additional regulatory framework around digital assets and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act seeks to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, directly to individuals.\nAfter signing the GENIUS ACT, Trump called back to his keynote address at a Bitcoin conference last year.\n\u201cI pledged that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the United States the crypto capital of the world,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. And under the Trump administration, this is only going further.\u201d\nThe GENIUS Act \u2014 short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins \u2014 requires monthly public disclosure of reserve competition and annual audited financial statements for issuers with a market cap higher than $50 billion, according to the Senate Banking Committee.\n\u201cJust as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoin,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cThis could be perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the internet itself.\u201d\nTrump has made an estimated $150 million from trading of his $Trump meme coin since its launch in January through mid-June, according to an analysis by crypto-risk modeling firm Gauntlet.\nA so-called \u201cunlock\u201d of Trump meme coins this week is expected to add another $100 million to the president\u2019s fortune, according to crypto research site Messari."

      "text": "Gemini \u2014 a crypto exchange run by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss \u2014 disclosed Friday it had confidentially filed for a US initial public offering, as digital asset firms seize on renewed market momentum.\nSeveral high-profile companies, including those in high-risk sectors such as crypto and financial technology, have launched successful listings in recent weeks, reflecting pent-up demand and renewed vigor in the capital markets.\nEarlier this week, stablecoin issuer Circle went public in a blowout debut on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\u201cPre-IPO crypto companies would be crazy not to move ahead with listings after seeing how Circle traded,\u201d said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs. \u201cCrypto can be an unpredictable market, so when you get a chance like this, you take it.\u201d\nThe surge in cryptocurrency IPOs signals a turning point for the industry, reflecting growing confidence among digital asset firms to attract mainstream investors and bringing increased transparency, regulatory scrutiny and capital that could help solidify crypto\u2019s place in traditional financial markets.\nGemini, which operates a trading platform enabling investors to buy, sell and store more than 70 crypto tokens, said it has not yet determined the size or proposed price range for its offering.\n\u201cGemini\u2019s move contributes to the broader momentum and reinforces the idea that crypto-native firms are increasingly preparing to access public markets,\u201d said Kat Liu, vice president at IPOX.\n\u201cMore broadly, this signals that long-anticipated firms are now ready to reengage with public capital,\u201d Liu added, noting that investor appetite is returning, especially for companies with well-defined business models in strategic sectors such as fintech, AI and digital assets.\nThe Winklevoss twins shot to fame after they sued Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, alleging he had stolen their idea for the social networking site. They agreed to a settlement in 2008, in which they received cash and Facebook stock.\nGrowing momentum\nThe global cryptocurrency market is currently valued at roughly $3.3 trillion with bitcoin trading firmly above the key $100,000 apiece milestone, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\u201cA successful listing would confirm that the crypto thaw is real,\u201d said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital Advisors. \u201cIf equity underwriters smell a new fee stream, expect the calendar to unfreeze for everything from fintech to AI chips.\u201d\nThe industry, particularly after the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US, has attracted billions in inflows from institutional investors seeking exposure to the asset class.\nIn May, Coinbase became the first US crypto-focused company to join the S&P 500, a watershed moment for the industry that signaled rising mainstream acceptance of digital assets.\nAs the crypto sector matures financially and gains regulatory footing, firms are becoming more integrated into traditional markets, though analysts caution that volatility and shifting rules still pose challenges.\nThis marks a sharp turnaround for an industry that spent more than a decade under intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide.\nAfter the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022, many institutional investors retreated from the digital asset market. Prices later recovered, and the sector gained fresh momentum when President Trump voiced support during his campaign, pledging to be a \u201ccrypto president.\u201d"

      "text": "Crypto giant Circle Internet Group\u2019s stock surged 168% above their initial offer price on Thursday in a major boost to an IPO market that had stagnated in recent months.\nShares of Circle, which moved to New York from Boston last year and is led by CEO Jeremy Allaire, opened at $69 and closed at $83.23. That pushed the company\u2019s valuation to $18.36 billion. It is the second-largest public listing by a crypto firm.\nThe strong projected debut came after Circle priced its IPO at $31 per share after the market closed on Wednesday \u2013 up from an earlier expected range of $27 to $28 per share.\nCircle is best known as the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), which is pegged one-for-one to the US dollar. USDC is the world\u2019s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, trailing only Tether\u2019s USDT, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.\nThe firm earlier said it will raise about $1.1 billion on an offering of 34 million shares.\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency with value directly pegged to a \u201cstable\u201d asset, like the US dollar or gold. They are seen as a less volatile investment option than cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which can experience major price swings during periods of market instability.\nCircle will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \u201cCRCL.\u201d The IPO is led by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.\nARK Investment Management, the firm led by famed tech investor Cathie Wood, has signaled interest in buying up to $150 million in shares, according to a regulatory filing.\nThe successful debut could nudge other crypto companies to explore IPOs.\n\u201cThe more crypto companies that go public, the easier it will be for future crypto companies,\u201d Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, told Reuters.\nStablecoins and other types of cryptocurrency have boomed in popularity in recent months following President Trump\u2019s election victory.\nTrump, who won the White House with the backing of many major crypto executives, has vowed to loosen the strict regulatory policy adopted under former President Joe Biden.\nLast month, the US Senate voted to advance the GENUIS Act, which would establish a first-of-its-kind regulatory framework for stablecoins. A different version of a stablecoin bill is up for consideration in the House."

      "text": "American Eagle \u2018almost paralyzed by body positivity\u2019 before it launched \u2018sultry\u2019 Sydney Sweeney ads\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters has made a bold, divisive bet on its \u201csultry\u201d Sydney Sweeney ads \u2014 but only after its commitment to the \u201cbody positivity\u201d movement started to falter, experts told The Post.\nA decade ago, the mall-based chain\u2019s 20-year-old lingerie brand Aerie famously took off as millennials shunned Victoria\u2019s Secret and its leggy, angel-winged supermodels in favor of Aerie\u2019s ads featuring ordinary women and diverse body types.\nBut recently, American Eagle\u2019s flagging sales show that \u201cinclusive fashion\u201d has its limits \u2014 especially after the election of President Trump, experts say.\n\u201cThey were almost paralyzed by their body positivity movement and were cautious about coming across too sexy,\u201d according to retail analyst Gabriella Santaniello, who heads up A-Line Partners.\nIn recent months, the retailer has been pivoting to more provocative looks \u2014 even before the Sweeney campaign rocked the internet late last month, Santaniello said.\nString bikinis and \u201ccheeky bottoms\u201d that expose more of women\u2019s butts, for example, were previously only available on American Eagle\u2019s website, but started cropping up in its stores earlier this year, she noted.\nSusan Scafidi, director of the Fashion Law Institute, has likewise noticed \u201cedgier\u201d looks and \u201cmore sultry styling. \u201cThis means featuring fewer boxy t-shirts and more cropped camisoles,\u201d she said.\nWhat\u2019s more \u2014 unlike competitors including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and the Gap \u2014 some pages on American Eagle\u2019s website have lately shown models going braless under various tops \u2014 and they aren\u2019t always subtle about it.\n\u201cAll of the teen retailers shy away from the nipple,\u201d Santaniello said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so odd that they\u2019re going for it.\u201d\nThen, in late July, came the Sweeney spots. In one video, the \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d and \u201cEuphoria\u201d star tinkers under the hood of a vintage Mustang GT350 before slamming it shut, wiping her hands on the butt of her jeans \u2014 and peeling off in a cloud of burning rubber.\nDays later, President Trump gushed that the ads were \u201chot\u201d and \u201cfantastic\u201d after he learned Sweeney was a registered Republican. The company\u2019s shares surged 23% on Trump\u2019s comment, drawing comparisons to meme stocks.\n\u201cThey had to do something different,\u201d said Hitha Herzog, a fashion management professor at Parsons School of Design. \u201cWe have a conservative president in office and we are seeing conversations that skew away from body positivity, inclusion and diversity.\n\u201cAmerican Eagle has always been good about knowing where the conversations are going,\u201d Herzog added.\nTraffic to American Eagle\u2019s US website soared following the campaign\u2019s rollout on July 23, rising more than 60% on July 28 compared to the same day last year, according to data and insights company Consumer Edge.\nMeanwhile, however, left-wing critics seized upon the campaign\u2019s tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d. In one clip, Sweeney explains that genes \u201coften determin[e] traits like hair color, personality and even eye color,\u201d before declaring, \u201cMy jeans are blue.\u201d\nAn ensuing fracas claimed the ads were promoting Nazi ideology, calling for boycotts of the 48-year-old company. According to a survey this week by Axios and Generation Lab, 39% of young women and 42% of Democrats said the ads made them less likely to buy American Eagle jeans.\nIn the week of Aug. 3, foot traffic at American Eagle stores dropped 8.9% on top of a 3.9% decline the previous week \u2014 far steeper than drops at rival chains including Abercrombie and the Gap, according to Pass_by.\n\u201cWhen a brand sees momentum stall so sharply, it often reflects a reputational or cultural factor,\u201d said James Ewen, vice president of marketing for Pass_by.\nAmerican Eagle posted its only message about the ad so far on Aug. 1 on its Instagram account.\n\u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We\u2019ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone,\u201d the company said."

      "text": "Kellogg\u2019s becomes first company to sign legally binding agreement removing toxic dyes from cereals\nAfter months of investigation and negotiations, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Wednesday that WK Kellogg Co. \u201cKellogg\u2019s\u201d will permanently remove toxic dyes from its cereals.\nIn a historic legal agreement, Paxton and Kellogg\u2019s signed an Assurance of Voluntary Compliance (AVC), which certifies that the company commits to removing artificial food colorings from its cereals by the end of 2027.\nWhile other companies have verbally committed to removing food dyes, Kellogg\u2019s is the first to officially sign a legally binding agreement confirming that it will remove food colorings, according to Paxton\u2019s office.\n\u201cFollowing months of investigating and negotiating, I\u2019m proud to officially say Kellogg\u2019s will stop putting these unhealthy ingredients in its cereals,\u201d Paxton wrote in a statement.\n\u201cThe signed AVC demonstrates that Kellogg\u2019s is committed to keeping this pledge, and I commend the company for doing the right thing.\u201d\nPaxton encouraged other food manufacturers to sign similar agreements to \u201cdemonstrate their commitment to helping Americans live healthier lives.\u201d\nIn February, Paxton\u2019s office issued a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) to Kellogg\u2019s, and formally announced an investigation in April after the company claimed it would remove petroleum-based food colorings in the US, but allegedly did not do so.\nInstead, Paxton\u2019s office claimed Kellogg\u2019s removed toxic ingredients in Canada and Europe, while continuing to put different types of blue, red and yellow dyes in American cereals.\nKellogg\u2019s markets popular cereals such as Froot Loops, Apple Jacks, Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies as \u201chealthy,\u201d Paxton previously said.\nHowever, he noted that some varieties contain petroleum-based artificial dyes linked to hyperactivity, obesity, autoimmune disorders, endocrine issues and cancer.\n\u201cA critical part of fighting for our children\u2019s future is putting an end to companies\u2019 deceptive practices that are aimed at misleading parents and families about the health of food products,\u201d Paxton wrote in a statement. \u201cArtificial food colorings have been shown to have disastrous impacts on health, and in no world should foods that include these dyes be advertised as \u2018healthy.\u2019\n\u201cThere will be accountability for any company, including Kellogg\u2019s, that unlawfully makes misrepresentations about its food and contributes to a broken health system that has made Americans less healthy,\u201d he added."
