      "summary": "Alexis Von Yates, a 35-year-old Florida nurse, has taken a plea deal for sexually abusing her 15-year-old stepson, which significantly reduces her prison sentence. Initially charged with unlawful sexual activity with a minor, she pleaded no contest to lewd and lascivious battery, resulting in a two-year prison sentence, followed by community control and probation. The plea agreement was supported by the victim's family to spare him from reliving the trauma during a trial.",
