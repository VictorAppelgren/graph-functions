  "content": "OpenAI's newest gpt-oss-20b model lets your Mac run ChatGPT-style AI with no subscription, no internet, and no strings attached. Here's how to get started.\n\nOn August 5 OpenAI released its first open-weight large language models in years, allowing Mac users to run ChatGPT-style tools offline. With the right setup, many Apple Silicon Macs can now handle advanced AI processing without a subscription or internet connection.\n\nRunning a powerful AI model on a Mac once required paying for a cloud service or navigating complex server software. The new gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b models change that.\n\nThe models offer downloadable weights that work with popular local-AI tools like LM Studio and Ollama.\n\nYou can try the model in your browser before downloading anything by visiting gpt-oss.com. The site offers a free demo of each model so you can see how it handles writing, coding, and general questions.\n\nWhat you need to run it\n\nWe recommend at least an M2 chip, and 16GB of RAM. More is better. If you have an M1 processor, we recommend the Max or Ultra. A Mac Studio is an excellent choice for this, because of the extra cooling.\n\nThe model struggled a bit on our MacBook Air with an M3 chip. As you'd expect, it heated up too.\n\nThink of it like gaming on the Mac. You can do it, but it can be demanding.\n\nTo get started, you'll need one of these tools:\n\u2022 MLX \u2014 Apple's machine learning framework, used by both apps for acceleration\n\nOllama is a lightweight tool that lets you run local AI models from the command line with minimal setup.\n\u2022 Install Ollama by following the instructions at ollama.com.\n\u2022 Open Terminal and run to download and launch the model.\n\u2022 Ollama will handle the setup, including downloading the right quantized version.\n\u2022 Once it finishes loading, you'll see a prompt where you can start chatting right away.\n\nIt works just like ChatGPT, but everything runs on your Mac without needing an internet connection. In our test, the download was about 12 GB, so your Wi-Fi speed will determine how long that step takes.\n\nOn a MacBook Air with an M3 chip and 16 GB of RAM, the model ran, but responses to questions took noticeably longer than GPT-4o in the cloud. That said, the answers arrived without any internet connection.\n\nThe 20-billion-parameter model is already compressed into 4-bit format. That allows the model to run smoothly on Macs with 16 GB of RAM for various tasks.\n\nIt's slower than cloud-based GPT-4o for complex tasks but responsive enough for most personal and development work. The larger 120b model requires 60 to 80 GB of memory, making it practical only for high-end workstations or research environments.\n\nLocal inference keeps your data private, since nothing leaves your device. It also avoids ongoing API or subscription fees and reduces latency by removing the need for network calls.\n\nBecause the models are released under the Apache 2.0 license, you can fine-tune them for custom workflows. That flexibility lets you shape the AI's behavior for specialized projects.\n\nGpt-oss-20b is a solid choice if you need an AI model that runs entirely on your Mac without an internet connection. It's private, free to use, and dependable once it's set up. The tradeoff is speed and polish.\n\nIn testing, it took longer to respond than GPT-4 and sometimes needed a little cleanup on complex answers. For casual writing, basic coding, and research, it works fine.\n\nIf staying offline matters more to you than performance, gpt-oss-20b is one of the best options you can run today. For fast, highly accurate results, a cloud-based model is still the better fit.\n\nTips for the best experience\n\nUse a quantized version of the model to reduce precision from 16-bit floating point to 8-bit or 4-bit integers. Quantizing the model means lowering its precision from 16-bit floating point to 8-bit or about 4-bit integers.\n\nThat cuts memory use dramatically while keeping accuracy close to the original. OpenAI's gpt-oss models use a 4-bit format called MXFP4, which lets the 20b model run on Macs with around 16 GB of RAM.\n\nIf your Mac has less than 16 GB of RAM, stick to smaller models in the 3 to 7 billion parameter range. Close memory-intensive apps before starting a session, and enable MLX or Metal acceleration when available for better performance.\n\nWith the right setup, your Mac can run AI models offline without subscriptions or internet, keeping your data secure. It won't replace high-end cloud models for every task, but it's a capable offline tool when privacy and control are important.",

MacBook Air History\n- Fourth gen\n- Third gen\n- Second gen\n- First gen\n- 7. Previous MacBook Air rumors\nThe MacBook Air is Apple's most popular Mac laptop with its blend of performance and portability. There are two sizes with M4 processors currently available in the lineup.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 introduced a new design with more ports and improved performance in 2022 and was followed by a 15-inch MacBook Air in 2023. The 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 remained for sale until March 2025 when the MacBook Air was updated with M4.\nSince it is the lowest price for a Mac laptop, the MacBook Air has been a popular choice for education markets. Apple targets lower price and portability above all else when it designs the MacBook Air.\nCustomers can expect an M5 update in 2026.\nRumors point to a possible resurrection of the MacBook that lacked an identifier. The original ran on Intel's mobile Core-M processor and ran incredibly slow in its 12-inch form factor, but a new model could be 13 inches and run the A18 Pro.\nMacBook Air Features\nApple redesigned the MacBook Air to take full advantage of M-series processors while remaining ultra-thin and light. The range of minor updates added up to a well-rounded laptop in 2022, which continue in the 2024 M3 model.\nThere is a 13-inch MacBook Air and 15-inch MacBook Air. They are identical in every way but size and a couple of insignificant changes.\nThe design and specs are mostly the same compared to the M3 model besides the new chipset, Wi-Fi 6E, and dual external display support in clamshell mode.\nMacBook Air design\nThe tapered case in the MacBook Air has been traded for a case with a uniform thickness. This brings the MacBook Air design in line with the 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nEven without the taper, Apple managed to keep the MacBook Air incredibly thin, with it being only 0.44 inches thick for the 13-inch model and 0.45 inches for the 15-inch model. That makes it Apple's thinnest laptop yet.\nApple kept the oversized trackpad and black Magic Keyboard in the M2 MacBook Air. The display bezel is thinner overall and has a notch cutout for the FaceTime HD camera.\nMacBook Air - Webcam, ports, and speakers\nApple upgraded the webcam to 1080p starting with the M2 model in 2022. The webcam should also see image quality gains thanks to an improved image signal processor in each generation.\nApple did not add additional Thunderbolt ports to the new MacBook Air. Both models still feature the same two Thunderbolt/USB-4 ports as the previous generation. However, the new models do include MagSafe, allowing the laptop to be charged without using up one of the vital ports.\nThe headphone jack in the MacBook Air has been updated to support high-impedance headphones. The 13-inch model is equipped with four speakers, while the 15-inch model boasts six speakers.\nApple Intelligence\nApple revealed it's new AI push during WWDC 2024 and it is called Apple Intelligence. It allows users to address various on-device models and Private Cloud Compute server-side models.\nEvery M-series Mac has access to the on-device Apple Intelligence models. There is the option of calling to ChatGPT on a per-request basis with user permission every time, and that feature arrived in macOS Sequoia 15.2 in late 2024.\nApple Intelligence is Apple's stab at integrating artificial intelligence into its line of products. As Apple prides itself on security, much of Apple Intelligence is done on device.\nAdditionally, Apple describes Apple Intelligence as \"personal Intelligence.\" Its primary focus is to improve the way users interface with the apps and services they already use, rather than focusing on novelty use cases.\nApple Intelligence is limited to M-series Macs and iPads, as well as iPhones running the A17 Pro chip and newer.\nProcessors\nApple updates the MacBook Air with a new M-series processor on a near-annual basis.\nM4 processor (2025)\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air with M4 is yet another basic spec bump. The M4 is a good chip that's great for Apple Intelligence features and offers modest performance improvements.\nThe M4 chip is built with a second-generation 3nm process and has a 10-core CPU, up to a 10-core GPU, and support for up to 32GB of unified memory.\nM3 processor (2024)\nThe MacBook Air with M3 can be classified as a basic spec bump, but the Apple M3 chip is a significant chipset upgrade. It brings hardware-accelerated ray tracing to graphics software and games, improved battery life, and better performance with streaming apps like Netflix and YouTube.\nThe M3 chip is built with the 3nm process and has an 8-core CPU, up to a 10-core GPU, and support for up to 24GB of unified memory.\nApple says the new MacBook Air is up to 60 percent faster MacBook Air with M1 and up to 13x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air. Apps like Final Cut see a 60 percent performance boost over M1 as well.\nOtherwise, the 2024 MacBook Air models are nearly identical to their M2 counterparts. The 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 has finally been removed from the lineup.\nM2 processor (2022)\nThe M2 processor is a direct successor to the M1. It is slightly larger with more transistors but still uses an 8-core CPU. It has an 8-core GPU in the base 13-inch configuration, which can be bumped up to 10 cores. The 10-core GPU is standard in the 15-inch MacBook Air.\nThe CPU in the M2 MacBook Air is up to 18% faster than the M1. It is also aided by the Media Engine, which wasn't introduced to the M1 lineup until the M1 Pro and M1 Max.\nThe GPU in the MacBook Air can be up to 35% faster than the M1 when upgraded to the 10-core variant. That means professional apps, games, and editing tools will perform much better.\nComputers running the M2 processor, including the MacBook Air, can still only connect to one external monitor via Thunderbolt at once.\nThe MacBook Air got a new design that removed the classic taper when the M2 model was introduced. Below is information about the older product design and its chipset.\nM1 MacBook Air Features\nWhen Apple transitioned the MacBook Air to the M1 processor, it altered little else about the device. It had the same 13.3-inch Retina Display with P3 color gamut and 400 nits of brightness.\nApple included two Thunderbolt/USB-4 ports on the side, which are a new spec above the previous Thunderbolt 3 ports. These enable wider compatibility with modern USB Type-C cables but are functionally the same.\nThe tapered case design goes from 0.63 inches to 0.16 inches to give the device an even thinner overall look. Even though Apple still calls this device the \"air\" for its size and weight, it is thicker than the 13-inch MacBook Pro at its thickest point.\nIt weighs only 2.8 pounds. Even the iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard weigh in at 3 pounds, the same as the MacBook Pro.\nMacBook Air - M1 processor\nApple says the M1 MacBook Air is up to 3.5x faster with 5x faster graphics than the Intel model it replaced. The claim stands up to benchmark scrutiny. Its single-core performance competes with Apple's Intel-based Mac Pro, and its multi-core score is higher than all Macs except those with more than 8 cores.\nThe M1 chip's balance of power and efficiency allows the new MacBook Air to operate without a fan, providing silent performance. The eight-core processor's big-little layout in the Apple Silicon MacBook Air results in low power consumption while still being able to activate performance cores when needed. The efficiency cores alone outperform the Intel Core i3 processor.\nIt runs macOS which has been overhauled to support the new M1 processor. macOS Monterey introduced new features like SharePlay and Universal Control to bring more utility to users steeped in the Apple ecosystem. Users can also run apps originally designed for iOS and iPadOS thanks to the processor.\nMagic Keyboard\nApple has moved its entire lineup to the new Magic Keyboard first introduced in the 16-inch MacBook Pro. A redesigned scissor mechanism with 1mm of travel means no more sticky keys from previous generations. The new keyboard in the MacBook Air also included the inverted-T arrow keys.\nIn the past, MacBook Air models had a butterfly keyboard, which underwent several updates in an attempt to address reliability issues. However, the butterfly switch often led to stuck keys or broken mechanisms, resulting in a higher failure rate compared to previous scissor-switch designs.\nApple had implemented keyboard repair programs for the butterfly keyboard, but the introduction of the new keyboard seems to be a final admission that there was some issue at hand. Even the latest iPad Pro keyboard uses the new Magic Keyboard design.\n720p Webcam\nThe late 2020 model MacBook Air with M1 chip offers improved video-chat capabilities. While the MacBook Air still has a 720p webcam, the M1 chip uses Apple\u2019s newest image signal processor (ISP) for improved image quality.\nThe new ISP adds greater dynamic range, better noise reduction, and superior auto white balance and machine-learning-enhanced face detection to make you look clearer in FaceTime or Zoom calls. That translates to improved video in low-light conditions.\nSecurity\nThe 2018 revision incorporated a Touch ID sensor for biometric identification. Touch ID has remained on the 2019 and 2020 MacBook Air refreshes and will likely be part of the MacBook Air until Apple possibly implements Face ID in a future model.\nThe T2 security chip is a separate piece of custom Apple Silicon that, for some key operations, sits between the Intel processor and macOS. It hosts the Secure Enclave for Touch ID and provides encryption services to macOS. The T2 chip also provides a secure boot, meaning the only processes that can run at startup are trusted and approved macOS software.\nmacOS Sequoia\nAnnounced at WWDC 2024, macOS Sequoia brings a number of new features to Apple computers. Here are some of the notable updates Mac owners get after installing the update.\nImproved Window Tiling\nAn improvement on existing window management features, the tiling of windows now handles similar to how some third-party management apps function.\nYou can drag a window to a spot on the screen, with it then automatically repositioning itself. For example, putting it to the far edge of a screen can make it expand to fill the left half of your display.\nMessages\nPreviously rumored before the event took place, this refers to iMessage. Users can now apply various effects to text that they send to other people.\nThis can include the standard bold, italics, and underlining of text, among other elements.\nAnother iMessage feature, it allows users to schedule messages to be sent to contacts at specific times. This can be useful to send out important news, reminders, and other time-specific information.\nTapbacks will gain the option to add emoji as reactions to a message.\niPhone mirroring\nUsers can bring their iPhone onto the macOS Sequoia desktop using the new iPhone Mirroring app. The iPhone just needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network and signed into the same Apple ID for the function to work.\nOnce connected, users will see a digital representation of the iPhone on the desktop. Apps can be opened and used with some exceptions.\nApps can't be reorganized and certain system functions aren't available, but otherwise, the iPhone can be operated normally. Any time a mirroring function is active, the iPhone remains locked and the screen is off.\nThe iPhone mirroring function relies on Continuity, which can only have one active session at once. So, users can't bring an iPhone into macOS while their Mac display is mirrored into Apple Vision Pro.\nDedicated Passwords app\nAfter incorporating passwords as part of the Keychain integrated into its operating systems, Apple has finally made an app for it. Passwords is used to manage authentication for users across Apple's ecosystem of devices.\nThe macOS version is the only one that can import password lists.\nSafari\nA new summarization feature, dubbed Highlights, provides users with a short summary paragraph that is contextually generated based on the webpage they are looking at. This can include details about locations when planning a trip, information about a TV show or movie, and even quick links to other resources.\nA new version of Reader mode has been redesigned with new elements, including a table of contents and a summary of the article.\nMacBook Air History\nApple's most popular laptop has a long history dating back to Steve Jobs pulling the first out of an envelope on stage. It has always been the budget/entry model in the lineup with decent base specs and generally a price that targets $999 unless its a redesign year.\nFourth generation\nIn June 2022, the MacBook Air was reimagined with a uniform thickness, MagSafe port, and notched display. It ran the M2 processor and had several upgrades throughout, including a larger 13.6-inch display.\nThe specs and design hasn't significantly changed since that 2022 redesign.\nThe Liquid Retina display is a 2560p by 1664p at 224 pixels per inch. It has 500nits of brightness and uses the P3 color gamut.\nThe M2 processor was up to 18% faster than the M1 and has a Media Engine for improved video editing and export. It still only supports one external display, but the added MagSafe port frees up an additional Thunderbolt for accessories.\nA 15-inch MacBook Air was introduced in 2023 with nearly identical specs beyond the size increase. It still had M2 and the same color options.\nA chipset upgrade was introduced in 2024 that changed little about the devices beyond what the M3 provided. Both the 13-inch MacBook Air and 15-inch MacBook Air were updated in tandem.\nApple upgraded both sizes of MacBook Air with M4 in 2025.\nThird generation\nIn October 2018, Apple redesigned and rebooted the MacBook Air after nearly a decade of selling models with the second-generation design.\nThe model introduced a Retina Display, Touch ID, and three color options in the third-generation. It essentially replaced the 12-inch MacBook, which Apple phased out of its lineup in the following months. This design features two Thunderbolt 3 ports, a 13.3-inch display with a resolution of 2560 x 1600, and, initially, the maligned butterfly keyboard.\nIn March 2020, faster 10th-generation Intel processors and the Magic Keyboard were added to the model, which also saw a lower starting price of $999. However, many users complained about its fans kicking in frequently due to a less-than-ideal cooling setup. Looking back, this may have been because Apple was prioritizing a significant hardware update for later that year.\nIn November 2020, Apple discontinued its use of Intel processors and introduced a new model powered by Apple Silicon. The M1-powered Macbook Air offered significantly improved performance and battery life. Apple claimed that the new model could deliver up to 3.5x faster processing power than the previous generation and up to 5x better graphical performance. The battery was said to last for up to 15 hours of web browsing. Additionally, this update removed the fans, allowing for silent operation.\nSecond generation\nIn 2010, Apple released the second-generation models with a tapered case and solid-state storage. There were 11-inch and 13-inch options.\nThis generation was well-received, helping to push the design into the mainstream. Within the next five years, the market was flooded with clones, and Microsoft later coined the name \"Ultrabook\" to denote Windows laptops that borrowed heavily from the MacBook Air.\nWith each update, Apple added more internal memory and faster processors. This was the last generation to include non-Retina displays and a MagSafe port.\nApple discontinued the 11-inch model in 2017 and the second-generation 13-inch MacBook Air in 2019.\nFirst generation\nIn 2008, to the delight and astonishment of those watching, Steve Jobs reached into a small envelope to reveal Apple's latest breakthrough product. The first MacBook Air had a 13.3-inch display and was 1.9cm thin, a remarkable design feat for its era.\nThis initial model made significant sacrifices to achieve that thin profile and solid battery life. Its 1.6GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor delivered less-than-stellar performance. The $1,799 entry-level model only had an 80GB hard drive, and a model with a 64GB solid-state drive and 1.8GHz processor cost $3,098.\nOne of the most controversial moves was Apple's decision not to include a CD/DVD drive. This move attracted significant skepticism and blowback at the time, given the prominent position optical drives still held in consumer technology. With iCloud and other cloud platforms looming on the horizon, Apple envisioned optical drives' relevance fading quickly. So, the company sacrificed the drive in the name of thinness and attractive design, a bet that ultimately paid off.\nThis move foreshadowed future decisions like the iPhone's headphone jack removal and the switching of all MacBook ports to Thunderbolt 3/USB-C.\nMacBook Air Price Guide\nApple eliminated the new sales of older MacBook Air models with the M4 update. The base M4 13-inch model starts at $999, and the 15-inch model starts at $1,199.\nOlder models can still be found on sale at steep discounts. Deals can be found on every model in our Mac Price Guide, broken down by screen size and chip below:\nPrevious MacBook Air rumors\nEverything below this point is a preserved section of rumors about the MacBook Air.\nM4 MacBook Air\nAn M4 MacBook Air lineup could be announced at any time, however Apple already short cycled the 15-inch MacBook Air with M3, so it may wait before updating to a new chipset. A spring 2025 is likely the earliest and update could occur, or summer with a WWDC announcement.\nThe base M4 has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU that can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM in the MacBook Pro. Dynamic Caching enables more impressive graphical processing like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh mapping.\nApple isn't likely to update much else about the MacBook Air beyond the chipset. The only other expected update beyond small tweaks is the inclusion of the 12MP webcam with Center Stage.\nRelease timing previously placed the M4 MacBook Air early in the year, but that window has flown by. The earlier confident timetable placed a refreshed MacBook Air first, followed by an iPhone SE 4, then iPad Air with M4 before WWDC.\nSo far, Apple released iPhone 16e, not an iPhone SE, and rumors around iPad updates have gone mostly quiet. Rumors have closed in on a release by April or May for the M4 MacBook Air."

Apple Silicon\nThe Mac is not a single computer but a lineup of models spanning laptops and desktops. It has been the center of Apple's successes for generations \u2014 from the first one released in 1984 to the one that saved the company from bankruptcy in 1998. Today, Apple's Mac lineup is used to develop apps for all of its platforms and remains essential to the ecosystem.\nThe transition to Apple Silicon breathed new life into the aging Mac platform thanks to the high speed and efficiency of the chipsets. Apple originally promised a two-year transition, but it took three years for the high-end desktop Macs to get Apple Silicon.\nM-series Mac models for sale\nMac Features\nPick up any Mac, and it will function the same as the others \u2014 with some caveats. Thanks to macOS, there will be little to no difference between how a desktop and a laptop perform. Much of the differences today lie in the processor type being used, not the machine's form factor.\nTouch ID is available on all modern Macs via either the built-in keyboard or an external Magic Keyboard sold by Apple. The Touch Bar has been retired and was used until the 13-inch MacBook Pro was discontinued in 2023.\nmacOS\nThe current version of macOS reflects Apple's decade of work trying to perfect the operating system. Mac OS X was the tenth iteration of the Mac operating system and debuted in 2001. The Mac OS X name stuck around for fifteen years but changed to macOS in 2016 to bring the naming scheme in line with Apple's other operating systems.\nThe OS stayed with 10.x versioning until 2020 when the shift to Apple Silicon and a foundational change in how specific systems were managed led to the version number increasing for the first time in a decade. macOS Big Sur was the first to buck the trend as it was version 11. The 2021 operating system release was macOS Monterey 12.0, followed by macOS Ventura 13.0, then macOS Sonoma 14.0, and now macOS Sequoia 15.0.\nThe Unix-based operating system should be instantly familiar to anyone who has interacted with a Mac in the past. Graphic elements and features change over time, but the overall layout and interaction schemes remained relatively the same. Opening an app would create an app instance in a window. However, closing a window would not close the app but rather leave it running in the background. The traffic light icons control the window management.\nThe most significant user-facing changes in recent years have revolved around security and bringing the desktop closer to iOS design paradigms. Windows have rounded corners now, apps use sidebars for navigation, and app permissions are more robust than ever.\nThe blend between iOS and macOS hit its peak with macOS Tahoe 26, which introduced Liquid Glass to the platform. The material is meant to emulate the transparent characteristics of visionOS.\nApps\nWhile the Mac went through its two-year transition to Apple Silicon, it used a program called Rosetta 2 that translated Intel-based Apps on the fly. This process is so efficient that the M1 Macs can run some Intel apps better than premium Intel Macs.\nUltimately, Rosetta 2 is only a stopgap that Apple will remove in future updates \u2014 developers are expected to transition their apps to Apple Silicon or be left behind. Rosetta 2 is still available in macOS Sonoma.\nAll of Apple's apps have already been written for the ARM, so Final Cut Pro and Logic work at full speed on the new machines.\nWhile Apple continues to push users to the Mac App Store, apps can still be downloaded directly from the web. Some apps require some additional security hoops to jump through, but still work.\nM-series Processors\nApple released its first three Macs with an M-series processor at the end of 2020. The 13-inch MacBook Pro, the M1 MacBook Air, and the Mac Mini. The processor was an immediate success, with users noting performance gains and quality-of-life improvements across the board.\nThe first iteration, the M1, is what Apple says the company can do when it brings its processor expertise to the Mac without much effort. The first machines are identical in every way to their Intel counterparts except for the processor.\nWith the release of the 2021 MacBook Pros, Apple announced the M1 Pro and M1 Max. These processors take the magic of the M1 even further with 10-core processors and up to 32-core GPUs. Very few Intel-based machines are able to compete in pure computing power.\nApple announced the M1 Ultra for use in the Mac Studio during a 2022 March event. It is the last M1 processor variant in the lineup and is expected to be included in a Mac Pro update later in 2022.\nThe M2 processor was announced during WWDC 2022 alongside an M2 MacBook Air and a processor bump in the 13-inch MacBook Pro. It is a slightly more powerful processor and a direct successor to the M1.\nThe M2 Pro and M2 Max were revealed in January 2023 and included in a spec-bumped MacBook Pro lineup. The Mac mini also gained the M2 and M2 Pro, widening its range of usability and performance greatly.\nDuring WWDC 2023 in June, the M2 Ultra was revealed. It is available in the Mac Studio and Mac Pro.\nContinuing the blistering pace, Apple released the M3 family of chips all at once in October 2023 \u2014 M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips launched in the 24-inch iMac and the MacBook Pro.\nApple revealed M4 with the iPad Pro in early 2024 and brought the chip to Mac in October. A redesigned smaller Mac mini got the M4 and M4 Pro, while the iMac was updated with M4.\nM4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max were included in the new MacBook Pro lineup. Little else changed in the spec update beyond a brighter displays, Thunderbolt 5 in high end models, and a Nano Texture option.\nThe Mac Studio and Mac Pro were skipped over in 2024 as Apple seemed intent on skipping over M3 Ultra. The 3nm process used for M3 is undesirable, so Apple quickly moved the lineup to M4.\nHowever, Apple did update the Mac Studio with M4 Max in 2025, but it did not reveal an M4 Ultra. Instead, the top-tier Mac Studio uses M3 Ultra and no M4 Ultra has been revealed.\nIntel\nApple cut off Intel entirely at the beginning of the Apple Silicon transition. Intel has had years of near-identical processor bumps with little user-facing improvements along the way. This led Apple to jump to internally-designed processors to ensure Mac's future was in its full control.\nWith each new M-series processor and Mac using it, Apple cut out more and more Intel machines from the lineup. After the M2 Ultra made it into Mac Pro, Apple no longer sells Intel models.\nSome Intel-based machines are still for sale at non-Apple distributors, but they will sell out eventually. The Intel-based Mac mini, for example, is now considered obsolete.\nMagic Keyboard\nApple refers to multiple products as the Magic Keyboard, but when discussing Macs, it applies to two \u2014 the built-in MacBook keyboards and the wireless keyboard. The new built-in Magic Keyboard uses scissor-switch mechanisms to ensure the keys function correctly with each press.\nApple tried using a \"butterfly\" mechanism in its MacBook keyboards, but this proved to be a reliability disaster. Users reported that keys would stick or fail regularly, so Apple finally reverted to the scissor switch, but with a new slimmer design.\nApple's wireless keyboards all use the old scissor-switch mechanism but remain thin and light despite the aging design. The external Mac desktop keyboards were updated with Touch ID and colors that match the 24-inch iMac, but little was changed about the overall shape and layout.\nMagic Mouse and Trackpad\nApple's trackpad has always been ahead of the competition in terms of reliability and usefulness. The Magic Mouse, however, is a bit of an anomaly.\nThe Magic Trackpad can connect via Bluetooth or a USB-C cable and uses taptic engines to simulate a click. The entire surface of the trackpad is \"clickable\" and doesn't physically move when pressed. The taptic engine vibrates during operation to fool users into thinking the device actually clicked.\nThe Magic Mouse is a small classically-designed mouse that uses touch-sensitive glass for input. Rather than having traditional mouse buttons, the entire top front of the mouse is clickable, and each side can recognize when pressed to simulate right and left clicks. Instead of a scroll wheel, the Magic Mouse uses a touch surface that users can swipe on.\nThe Magic Mouse is controversial because it can only be used over Bluetooth and charges via USB-C when upside-down. The port placement was an obvious form-over-function choice from an \"old Apple\" that wanted the mouse to look seamless \u2014 even at the detriment of usefulness.\nPro Display XDR\nApple may have said it is out of the display business, but it revealed the Pro Display XDR alongside the Mac Pro in 2019. This 6K display has been calibrated to represent near-perfect color and contrast representation when showing images. Apple says it is competitive with $24K reference monitors used by film professionals.\nCustomers can add a nano-texture to the display for an additional $1,000. Controversially the monitor doesn't come with a stand. Customers must choose between an expensive VESA adapter or a $1,000 stand.\nThe Pro Display XDR results from Apple's desire to achieve perfection and features a price to match. Some rumors speculate that Apple is planning on more consumer-friendly monitors in the future.\nStudio Display\nApple introduced the Studio Display as a companion to the Mac Studio. It is a 27-inch 5K display with True Tone and P3 color. It connects via Thunderbolt 3 and integrates with macOS features like Spatial Audio and Center Stage.\nThis new monitor runs an A13 for audio, microphone, and camera processing. It works with modern Intel Macs, all M-series Macs, and the latest iPads with the M1 processor.\nThe 27-inch iMac was discontinued after the Studio Display was announced. It isn't clear if Apple could still revive the product at a later date with Apple Silicon.\nThunderbolt\nApple uses Intel's Thunderbolt spec across all of its Mac computers. M1 Macs use Thunderbolt/USB-4 connectors while the M1 Pro/M1 Max MacBook Pros use Thunderbolt 4.\nThunderbolt 4 allows up to 100W of power and 40GB/s of data over a single USB-C cable and is fully backward compatible with previous cable specs. The spec also allows multiple Thunderbolt devices to be chained together to maximize the one connection's utility.\nThe M1-based Macs have some limitations when using Thunderbolt, however. Users can only connect one external monitor via a Thunderbolt connection and cannot use e-GPUs. The monitor support is expected to increase in future iterations of the M-series processor, but e-GPU support may never come.\nThe 2021 and later MacBook Pros can connect multiple external displays thanks to improvements with the included Thunderbolt controllers.\nM4 Macs can connect to two 6K external displays, or three in the case of the Mac mini. The high end Mac mini and MacBook Pros have three Thunderbolt 5 ports.\nTouch Bar\nThe Touch Bar is an OLED strip that appeared at the top of old MacBook Pro models. It replaced the function row keys as a new variable input device for certain apps. Apple had iterated slightly on the Touch Bar design, like re-introducing a physical escape key, but little else changed over the years.\nThe Touch Bar had been neglected in software too. Apple paid little attention to the hardware when updating macOS or its apps, and third parties have mostly ignored it as well.\nApple originally introduced the Touch Bar as a new interaction paradigm that would give pro users a new way to interact with apps. It offered a novel way to scrub timelines or switch between tools in certain apps but left a lot to be desired otherwise. The lack of haptics and accidental touches made the Touch Bar more of a nuisance for some users than a boon.\nWith the release of the 2021 MacBook Pros, Apple removed the Touch Bar in favor of full-sized function keys. The company didn't bother to mention the Touch Bar once during the announcement, signaling its demise.\nIt survived in only one model thanks to a lack of redesign \u2014 the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Apple discontinued that model in 2023, thus finally killing the Touch Bar entirely.\nHistory of the Mac\nThe Mac began in 1979 with Jef Raskin, initially Apple's 31st employee and taken on as Manager of Publications. Having broad experience in computing and regularly using what he called his \"honorary beanbag chair\" at Xerox PARC, he knew about its graphical user interfaces (GUIs) before Steve Jobs did.\nRaskin consequently wanted a graphical bitmapped screen for a computer, but he also had very many more aims for what he saw as the future of the technology. Sometime around March 1979, he lobbied then Apple chairman Mike Markkula to begin a project he initially called \"Annie,\" but later renamed Macintosh.\nFar more than some verbal pitch or vague request to work on a new project, Raskin wrote up an entire set of papers that he ultimately called \"The Book of Macintosh.\" The complete text, now available online, ranges from an \"Annie\" memo of May 1979 to a \"January 1980 Overall Summary.\"\nRight from the start, though, the core aim was to make a computer that was simple to use.\n\"This is an outline for a computer designed for the Person In The Street (or, to abbreviate: the PITS),\" wrote Raskin. \"[One] that will be truly pleasant to use, that will require the user to do nothing that will threaten his or her perverse delight in being able to say: 'I don't know the first thing about computers, and one which will be profitable to sell, service and provide software for.\nWhen he first proposed \"Annie\" \u2013\u2013 what he really thought would eventually be called the Apple V \u2013\u2013 Raskin knew that the company was developing the Apple Lisa. However, Raskin predicted that the Lisa would be \"overpriced and too slow.\"\nSo as well as a computer for the Person in the Street, he wanted it to be affordable. Raskin's plan was for a computer that cost $500, ran on the low-cost Motorola 6809 processor \u2013\u2013 and did not include a mouse.\nThat lack of a mouse, and so the lack of being able to point and click, means that Raskin may not have envisaged the kind of GUI that we now imagine. At the same time, the Apple Lisa may not have always been planned to have a GUI \u2013\u2013 until Steve Jobs saw one at Xerox PARC.\nJef Raskin and Steve Jobs did not get along, but Raskin wanted Jobs to see the work being done at PARC. He called on Bill Atkinson, a principal designer of the Lisa and Mac GUIs, to talk Jobs into visiting Xerox.\nThe famous visits to PARC in November and December 1979 ultimately led to the Macintosh, but initially, they transformed the Apple Lisa. That project now definitely had to have a GUI, and if Steve Jobs had stayed with the Lisa, Jef Raskin might have got his simple, cheap Macintosh.\nHowever, Jobs reportedly antagonized people enough that Apple's then-president Michael Scott removed him from the Lisa project. Jobs then decided to take over Macintosh and effectively make it better than the Lisa.\nThis did push Raskin aside, which lead him to leave the project in summer 1981. However, his overall ethos of simplicity, and especially of it being an appliance, stayed. \"The computer must be one lump,\" Raskin had written. \"Seeing the guts is taboo.\"\nThe low cost, though, and everything that contributed to that did not stay. Raskin formed the Macintosh team, but it was because of Jobs that the Mac ran on the more costly Motorola 68000 and that it got a mouse.\n1984 - The Macintosh debuts\nBy the time it was launched, Raskin's $500 Macintosh had become Jobs's $2,495 one. Some of that was due to then-CEO John Sculley wanting to make back Apple's considerable spending on advertising.\nMuch of it, though, was Steve Jobs pressing for better components and a better experience for the user. Despite being willing to do that even as it pushed the price up, though, Jobs was not willing to do it enough. The Mac that launched in 1984 was underpowered.\nIt was also a flop. It changed the world \u2013\u2013 truly \u2013\u2013 but that original Mac did not change Apple. At least, not at first. For its initial several years, the Mac and Apple were supported by the high sales of the Apple II.\nThat machine faded away as the original Macintosh became the \"Fat Mac,\" with double the RAM, in September 1984. Then in 1987, came the Macintosh II and the Macintosh SE.\nThese initial successors just addressed shortcomings in the original Mac. That ranged from the lack of RAM to how it initially only ran in black and white.\nThen in January 1989, Apple launched the upgraded Macintosh SE/30. And in 1990, it brought out the \"wicked fast\" Macintosh IIfx. While other models were popular, and some like the IIci are fondly remembered, these two were arguably the workhorses of the Mac range.\nThe early 1990s \u2014 from innovation to complication with Centris, Quadra, and Performa\nSteve Jobs was long gone by the time the SE/30 and IIfx were beloved. His time away from Apple is perhaps more remembered now, though, for what happened next with the Macintosh.\nThe answer is simultaneously a lot and not very much. The Mac grew steadily more capable and steadily more successful in the late '80s, including the over-engineered but significant Macintosh Portable in 1989.\nUnfortunately, the Mac started to become only a little more capable, and it steadily became less successful in the early '90s.\nApple decided to provide a model of Mac at every possible price point and for every conceivable type of customer. Businesses got the Macintosh Quadra range from 1991 and the Macintosh Centris models from 1992, but both were gone by 1995.\nConsumers got the Macintosh Performa range, which lasted from 1992 to 1997, but these were just renamed versions of the Quadra, Centris, and LC models. They were given new names, a plethora of marketing model numbers based on starting specs, some cosmetic differences. Then they were sold through big-box stores such as Sears, Service Merchandise, and just about anywhere else that had a pulse and a sufficiently large retail footprint.\nOr rather, they weren't. The Performa range, with its dozens of different configurations and models, sold poorly.\nHowever, the two bright spots in this period were the PowerBook range, from 1991, and the transition from 68000 processors to the PowerPC from 1994.\nPowerBooks were the \"Mac in a book\" that Steve Jobs had been pressing for from the start, and their design completely transformed laptops. They moved the keyboard to the back, meaning users' palms rested on the machine instead of awkwardly hanging over the edge. Every single laptop since has copied this.\nSimilarly, the PowerBook Macs later introduced the trackpad, and practically every laptop since then has followed along.\nEven with the PowerBook range's success, though, and the move to PowerPC, Apple struggled because it was spread very thin.\nThe late 1990s - Jobs returns\nApple was trying to get an updated Mac OS off the ground alongside countless indistinguishable Mac models. With years of effort having nothing to show for it, eventually, Apple began to look at buying in an alternative from outside the company \u2013\u2013 and it did.\nApple bought the basis of what would become OS X, but it also brought back Steve Jobs. Apple bought Jobs's failing NeXT Computer in 1996.\n\"This is a complementary arrangement,\" then-CEO Gil Amelio said at the time, \"The pieces fit together better than any alternative we looked at, and it will launch a new round of technology.\"\nIn the long term, Amelio would prove to be correct. But in the short term, he found himself out of a job. It wasn't that Steve Jobs took over \u2013\u2013 not at first. Instead, it was the fortunes of Apple that kept on declining, at one point requiring the laying off of 3,000 employees.\nThere were also public-facing debacles such as Amelio, presenting at Macworld and entirely forgetting to introduce the guest of honor Muhammad Ali. Behind the scenes, Oracle tried and failed to make a hostile takeover bid for Apple \u2013\u2013 and it was later revealed that Jobs had supported it.\nOn July 4, 1997, Apple's board told Gil Amelio he was no longer wanted. He officially resigned as CEO on July 9. Steve Jobs was actually put in charge of finding a replacement, and after a few months, became the interim CEO himself.\n\"I couldn't even figure out the damn product line after a few weeks,\" Steve Jobs then said in September 1997. \"I kept saying what is this model, how does this fit? I started talking to customers and they couldn't figure it out either, and so you're gonna see the product line get much simpler and you're gonna see the product line get much better.\"\nJobs' iMac saved Apple\nJobs came in As interim CEO, and then fully the CEO, Jobs sought to save Apple from bankruptcy and did so initially with the Macintosh. Working with Apple designer Jony Ive, Jobs created the iMac.\nAnnounced in 1998, 14 years after the original Macintosh, the new iMac was visually striking, and introduced new technologies that the rest of the industry then emulated.\nIt also introduced new colors so that the Mac was no longer a kind of yellowing beige, and instead was vivid Bondi Blue, and more. \"The one thing Apple is providing now is leadership in colors,\" Bill Gates said in 1998. \"It won't take long for us to catch up with that, I don't think.\"\nThat was an example of Gates missing a point because, as Jobs later said, \"the only problem with Microsoft is that they have no taste.\" Where Gates saw color as a quick paint job, Apple saw design as being about everything from how something looked to how it was used.\nSo alongside its painted exterior, the iMac brought approachability. Jef Raskin had wanted his Macintosh to have a handle, and the iMac still had one. Maybe you never picked it up, but it always felt as if you could, so it seemed lighter than it was, it seemed approachable.\nThen it also introduced USB to the wider world. True, the iMac used that technology in the iMac's \"hockey puck\" mouse, and that was excruciatingly poor. But it brought USB into the mainstream, and rival manufacturers soon fell into the now-familiar pattern of mocking an Apple decision, then copying it.\nIn 1999, Jobs took the iMac ideas and put them into the iBook. It had similar bright colors, it had a handle, but it also had Wi-Fi. It was the first consumer notebook to have Wi-Fi built-in, and Jobs demonstrated that as if he were a magician, loading up internet pages with no visible wires.\nApple, Intel, and the late '00s\nThe iMac and the iBook saved Apple, and then from 2001, it did seem as if the company went iPod-mad. That music player became an incredible source of revenue for Apple, and it also introduced Apple to very many users.\nPlenty of those users then learned about the Mac, and consequently, its share of the market rose. But with more people using the Mac came more demands on it, and the PowerPC processor was not keeping up.\nSo in 2005, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was going to undertake another transition, this time from PowerPC to Intel.\n\"Why are we going to do this?\" he said. \"Didn't we just get through going from OS 9 to OS X? Isn't the business great right now? Why do we want another transition? Because we want to make the best computers for our customers going forward.\"\nMoving to Intel gave the Macintosh a boost it could not have got from PowerPC. Although it tied Apple to Intel's schedule of releases, it also enabled ever more powerful Macs, including the iMac Pro.\nMac Pro and consumer Macs\nWhen it launched in 2017, the iMac Pro was praised but seen as a stopgap while Apple worked on a revised Mac Pro. Very unusually, the company had even said that it was working on one \u2013\u2013 and it did so because, at this point, the Mac Pro was languishing.\nOriginally introduced as the top-end Mac for power users in 2006, the \"cheese grater\" machine that evolved from the PowerMac G5, had hit its limits long before the range was replaced in late 2013. That December 2013 Mac Pro was the cylindrical \"trash can\" model and it failed, mostly because Apple didn't predict the increasing focus on GPU power versus CPU.\nIt was gorgeous to look at, but unlike its predecessor, it had barely any expandability. Apple would later say that thermal issues in its design limited it.\nWhat it looked to the outside world, and most particularly to power user creatives, was that Apple was focusing more on consumers. It was, too, with the iPhone, and then to a lesser extent the iPad, becoming what Apple was known for.\nBy 2015, there were eighteen iPhone users for every individual Mac user, and this number has only grown since. Of course, the company served its new core audience \u2013\u2013 but the old core audience was drifting away.\nHence the 2017 iMac Pro, then the 2019 Mac Pro. The 2019 Mac Pro was the most expensive Mac in decades, surpassed only by the IIfx, and it could be expanded at a cost greater than all but the most pro users could contemplate.\nApple was telling the power users that the Mac was back. It just very shortly afterward told them the Mac was changing.\nNext stop, Apple Silicon\nDespite the extremely high performance of the 2019 Mac Pro, being tied to Intel was limiting how much Apple could do when Intel itself was not sticking to its own development plans. Intel processors, as a whole, were hitting limits that Apple needed to exceed.\nCustomers could see the limitations and the delays, so of course, Apple could as well. In 2020, Tim Cook announced the long-rumored, much-awaited next transition.\nThe Mac in 2020 would still follow Jef Raskin's aim of being the simplest computer to use, but it is the Apple Silicon M1 processor that would be unrecognizably fast. That's unrecognizably faster than anyone from Raskin's time could imagine, but also faster than even present-day Intel users could.\nAfter releasing the M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, and M1 Ultra, Apple introduced the M2, restarting the cycle anew. M2 Pro and M2 Max followed in early 2023, with the M2 Ultra arriving later in June.\nM3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max were announced in October 2023 with even more improvements. They are the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac built on the 3nm process.\nM4 arrived in the Mac in October 2024. The M4 Pro was revealed with the redesigned Mac mini while the M4 is used in the base Mac mini and iMac. M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max are available in the MacBook Pros, which also have brighter displays with optional Nano Texture.\nThe M4 Ultra is due in the Mac Studio and Mac Pro in the summer of 2025. The M5 processor should debut before the end of 2025 in select Macs."
