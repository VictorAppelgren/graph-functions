  "title": "I tried the new focus timer app that everyone's talking about but it didn't click",
  "description": "Focus timers aren\u2019t one-size-fits-all.",
  "content": "The timer trend is everywhere. Tons of apps are built around strict sessions, breaks, and nudges. I downloaded the one making the rounds right now, but I won't be using it. Sometimes the tool that works for everyone else just doesn\u2019t fit how your brain ticks.\n\nWith a focus on a cute animated bean character, Focus Friend is the latest focus timer app people have been talking about. It\u2019s developed with Hank Green\u2014a YouTuber, author, and biologist\u2014and was released in August 2025. It\u2019s free and available for both iOS and Android.\n\nI\u2019ve used screentime reduction apps with success, but I\u2019m always looking for other options to help me focus. Focus Friend intrigued me with its friendly and soft vibe and its rounded and cute illustrations in the interface.\n\nYou can name your bean character, or keep the default \u201cBean\u201d name. This instantly turns Focus Friend into a Tamagotchi of the modern day. It\u2019s like naming a pet that lives in your phone.\n\nAlthough Focus Friend is free, there are options to purchase other bean character skins like \u201cHank Bean,\u201d \u201cJelly Bean Pack,\u201d or \u201cKitt-ney Bean.\u201d You could also purchase Focus Friend Pro for more premium knitted goods or decorations\u2014although this won\u2019t aid your focus, I\u2019m sure.\n\nThe home screen prompts that \u201cBean needs help focusing\u201d and uses a body-doubling-esque technique to encourage that when Bean focuses, so should you. Selecting Focus lets you choose for how long in 5-minute increments. Body-doubling is a popular focus tip, similarly to making a time-lapse of yourself to hold accountability.\n\nWhen Focus mode is on, you\u2019ll only see Bean knitting, facing away from the screen so you can see its cute illustrated bean backside. With your phone\u2019s volume on, you\u2019ll also listen to the relaxing lo-fi music Bean knits to.\n\nBean will knit for as long as you stay in focus; the longer you\u2019re focused, the more knitted goods\u2014socks or scarves\u2014you\u2019ll get as a result. Canceling your focus means Bean\u2019s knitting goes to waste.\n\nBean\u2019s knitted goods can be used to \u201cpurchase\u201d decorations in Bean\u2019s room/home with items like floor paint, a trash can, wall art, a table, and more. I haven\u2019t focused enough to purchase any, but I believe there are also room expansions for Bean\u2019s home with continued Focus credits.\n\nYour reward for focusing is being able to gamify your digital pet\u2019s home. Although cute and fun, I believe this might end up encouraging you to use your phone more and forget the main purpose of Focus Friend.\n\nFocus Friend gives you the choice\n\nWhen Focus Mode is on, Bean knits. That\u2019s all that\u2019s on your screen during this time. It\u2019s a repeated animation loop of knitting, rather than a progressive animation showing how much Bean has knitted, so it\u2019s not exciting to watch and won\u2019t distract you.\n\nAlthough the screen doesn\u2019t show anything distracting in Focus Mode, you can still receive phone notifications from other apps. Luckily, there\u2019s an option to switch to Deep Focus Mode, which prevents external notifications during focus time.\n\nYou can switch these modes under the settings tab on the Focus Friend home screen. Deep Focus also lets you choose if any specific apps should allow notifications to appear, so you don\u2019t have to be entirely blocked from the digital world.\n\nIn the settings, you can also choose to listen to the calming music while not actively in the app, although this will drain your phone\u2019s battery significantly faster. The option for music while using Focus Friend is good, although the music doesn\u2019t change, so it might lead to insanity after prolonged focus sessions.\n\nFocus Friend is too gimmicky for me\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant app, but I won\u2019t be using it\n\nI can see why plenty of people would enjoy using Focus Friend as it\u2019s such an inviting and cute app to use, but that\u2019s exactly why I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll continue using it.\n\nFor me, focus apps need to be as hands-off as possible. They should have a functional interface, but not one that I want to engage in\u2014the idea of these apps is to discourage phone use, not to encourage it. Focus Friend is just too inviting.\n\nThe gamified aspect of Focus Friend would lead me to pick up my phone between every focus round and scour through the decorative inventory deciding how to decorate Bean\u2019s digital home. Before I know it, I\u2019ve lost my focus again, and it\u2019s the app\u2019s fault.\n\nFor me, specifically, Focus Friend isn\u2019t so helpful since I switch to my laptop for work-based activities and often put my phone away anyway, like locking it in a cupboard to keep it out of reach. Focus Friend isn\u2019t available for desktop\u2014but maybe it will be one day\u2014so using it actually encourages me to keep my phone nearby, which isn\u2019t beneficial for me to focus anyway. Luckily, there are plenty of desktop-based focus tools to use instead.\n\nHowever, I recognize that many people would benefit from a knitting bean mascot. The idea of dedicating focus time to decorating a digital home could encourage them to put their phone down and focus on their tasks. I think Focus Friend is worth trying, as even if it doesn't work for your focus needs, it's a wholesome app to keep on your phone just in case.",

  "summary": "Focus Friend, a focus timer app developed by Hank Green, has been gaining popularity and is being hailed as a must-have app for helping people focus. The app features a cute animated bean character named \"Bean\" and uses a body-doubling-esque technique to encourage people to focus when Bean focuses, and so should you. The longer you stay focused, the more knitted goods you get as long as you stay in focus, resulting in increased use of these items. The free app also allows users to purchase other bean character skins and decorations. However, this may encourage people more to use their phone more and distract them from focusing. Despite this, Focus Friend is too gimmicky and uninvitable. Despite these features, I believe it will continue using it.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nYou may not want to hear it, but your phone could very well be what's standing between you and excellent grades. If you struggle to stay away from it while studying, I have a productivity hack that could transform your study routine.\n1 Recording Time-Lapses Keeps Me Away From My Phone\nAs a student, you've probably organized all your textbooks and study materials, made your favorite drink, and sat down, fully motivated and prepared for an intensive study session\u2014only to end up scrolling through your favorite social media apps for hours. A perfectly good day wasted, right? Unfortunately, I used to fall into this vicious cycle nearly every day, even with a solid weekly study plan in place.\nWhile I'd often turn to dedicated app blockers like OffScreen, they weren't always enough to keep me from giving in to distractions. That's when I realized I needed to eliminate the distraction, my phone, entirely. Instead of locking it in a cupboard, I decided to prop it up on my desk and record a time-lapse of my study session.\nSurprisingly, it kept me away from my phone for hours, and the act of recording made me feel accountable to stay on task.\n2 Motivates Me to Keep Going Instead of Taking Breaks\nOver the years, I've tried almost all the productivity methods people rave about, and all typically swear by taking breaks regularly. While I'm not denying the importance of breaks, taking one when you're in the groove might not be the best idea, as it can disrupt your momentum.\nEven if you feel groggy or worn out after focusing on the same task for too long and decide to take a break, using your phone during it is one of the worst mistakes you can make. Before you know it, you'll find yourself stuck in the vicious cycle I mentioned earlier. That's where I've found recording a time-lapse of myself comes in clutch.\nSince I'm essentially documenting my progress on video, I often find myself wanting to study for longer stretches instead of pausing the video and starting a new one the next time I'd like to study. And even if I decide to take a break without starting a new video, I do so without reaching for my phone, which is a much better option.\nWhat I typically do while recording a time-lapse is watch a pre-recorded or live \"Study With Me\" stream (another odd method I use to stay focused) that includes a timer and spans several hours. For example, in the time-lapse below, you can see me working on an assignment while tuning in to one of these streams.\nOnce the time for a break rolls around, I either continue studying if I'm not tired or take a short walk around the house or just freshen up instead of reaching for my phone, since I'd need to end my timelapse to do so! This helps me stay on track while also reminding me to take regular breaks.\n3 Gives Me a Video to Reflect On and Share\nMany people treat themselves to a sweet snack or an episode of their favorite Netflix show after a productive day. For me, the time-lapse of a successful study session becomes a reward in itself. Watching a sped-up video of my hard work gives me a sense of accomplishment and motivates me to keep going.\nSometimes, I like to create short daily recap videos as Instagram Reels or TikToks and share them with my friends. Snippets from my study time-lapses fit perfectly into these videos, and allow me to realistically show what I\u2019ve been up to. Plus, they can inspire and motivate my friends to stick to their own goals.\nThe best part about this odd yet effective study hack is that you don\u2019t need any additional equipment or apps. Most modern iPhones and Android phones come with a built-in time-lapse mode that works perfectly for this method. On an iPhone, simply open the Camera app and select the Time-Lapse mode.\nOn Android devices, you\u2019ll typically find this feature in the Camera app under the More section, where additional shooting modes are listed. It may be labeled as Hyperlapse instead of time-lapse.\nIf your device doesn\u2019t have a built-in time-lapse option, you can use a third-party time-lapse app or record a regular video and speed it up using an editing app of your choice.\nYou can also use a phone stand or tripod to prop your device up while recording to prevent shaky footage. I'd recommend experimenting with a few different angles to figure out what works best for you. Personally, I like positioning my camera to capture my desk and work without including myself in the frame.\nThis way, one added benefit is that the time-lapse records my laptop screen as well, which helps keep me accountable and prevents distractions like watching YouTube or Netflix mid-study session.\nRecording a time-lapse for hours can drain your device\u2019s battery, so be sure to charge it beforehand. You can also reduce the brightness to minimize battery drain during the recording.\nWhile this method may not seem appealing at first, I highly recommend giving it a try at least once. You\u2019ll likely only appreciate its effectiveness after watching your first time-lapse and reflecting on how productive (or not) your session was!"

      "text": "Doomscrolling is the easiest way to lose track of time and lose your day\u2019s productivity in a zombie-fied state. The Steppin app puts control back in your hands\u2014or even, your feet\u2014making you earn your time to unblock phone apps by walking first.\nWhy I Chose to Use the Steppin App\nAs with many Millennials or Gen Zers\u2014and let\u2019s be honest, even our parents\u2019 generations too\u2014I find myself wasting the day away scrolling on my phone. Hour after hour. And it often feels like I don\u2019t have enough time in the day to complete the real tasks on my to-do list.\nAs I work from home, I can have my phone right by me at all hours of the day. And it\u2019s tough to put it down once I\u2019ve picked it up. I\u2019ve tried countless other techniques to try to reduce my screen time, but I always find excuses to use my phone, and then, before I know it, four hours of scrolling have gone by.\nWith an average of over eight hours per day of screen time\u2014which includes all types of apps and domains, not just social media\u2014it was getting problematic for me. But downloading Steppin was a technique I hadn\u2019t yet tried.\nI figured, why not try something new? It couldn\u2019t make my phone addiction any worse.\nDownload: Steppin for iOS (Free)\nHow I Use My Phone\u2019s Focus Modes to Be More Present in What I'm Doing\nSimple tweaks have made a huge difference to my productivity, and they can for you too.\nI Used Steppin For A Week\u2014What I Learned\nI first downloaded Steppin late on a Sunday night. I\u2019d already been making changes to my life to encourage less phone use, more outdoor time, and, overall, a more productive day, including avoiding my inbox before midday. Finding Steppin allowed me to combine all these items together, in hopes that I can reduce my phone screen time while being more active and ultimately productive with my time.\nSince I\u2019ve already been trying to get outdoors more in the day time, Steppin came at the perfect time. I always intend not to use my phone in the morning anyway, so scheduling a midday walk most days works for me, as it builds the minutes of available screen time after the time I allow myself to use my phone.\nI work as a pet-sitter and dog-walker, so when I have clients to walk, I easily build up screen time earlier in the day than when I\u2019m at home on a regular day. This is both a benefit and a curse, as it\u2019s beneficial to get outside and walk earlier in the day, but then the temptation of knowing I have available screen time niggles in the back of my head earlier on than if I knew I had none.\nWhen first installing Steppin, I set my preferences at the time. I went for the default options, which included a midnight reset, daily accumulation of steps, and 100 meters of walking, resulting in one minute of screen time.\nI Take My Phone With Me More\nUsually, I try to leave my phone in my bedroom when I start my morning routine. I never take my phone to the bathroom unless it\u2019s already in my pocket. I don\u2019t pick my phone up when walking to the kitchen or from room to room in my house. Often, I try to leave my phone by my bed while I work in my office for the day, in a bid to avoid more distractions.\nSince downloading Steppin, I\u2019ve found I take my phone absolutely everywhere I go in hopes I can earn a minute or two of time from gaining steps from the mindless walking around my house. This goes against the purpose of downloading Steppin, really. But maybe that\u2019s how bad my phone addiction has gotten.\nOn days when I know I can\u2019t get out for a walk until the evening, it makes me nervous that I am entirely blocked from social media. I don't have a large house, but I have found myself making reasons to walk downstairs to the kitchen or from bedroom to office at midday just in hopes I can reach the first 100m of walking and gain one minute of time, in case I have an emergency to use my apps.\nThis is nonsensical, of course, and over the course of a week using Steppin, I found myself doing this less. I make intentional walks part of my daily routine as a result, benefitting my time management and my health.\nOver time, using Steppin has made me less reliant on my phone, even if initially it made me more obsessed with it.\nCustomization Isn\u2019t Super Flexible After Setting Up\nAlthough the preferences in Steppin are customizable and actually quite flexible, once you\u2019ve set them at the start, it becomes less flexible to change them. This is due to the streak-based system in place. If you change your preferences later, you lose your streak.\nIn my self-imposed rules of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d apps, messaging apps are \u201cgood\u201d and scrolling apps are \u201cbad.\u201d I want to keep my contact availability for work, friends and family, or organizations I\u2019m in, and not make myself feel like I\u2019ve forced social isolation by removing access to messaging apps.\nThere\u2019s no differentiation between a domain and an app block in Steppin, so despite the fact I tried to keep my Facebook Messenger app unblocked but blocked the Facebook domain\u2014since I don\u2019t have the app installed anyway\u2014I found it frustrating that the Messenger app was equally blocked. This could probably be avoided if I installed Facebook so I could block the app rather than the domain\u2014but that seems counterproductive to me.\nThe time resets at midnight, so any steps I\u2019ve earned throughout the day don\u2019t matter once I\u2019ve woken up. Largely, this is a great system, as it means there\u2019s nothing to entice me to switch off my phone alarm and immediately start scrolling.\nI meditate after waking up each morning by using YouTube videos. I initially wanted to block YouTube as it encourages mindless scrolling or watching long videos with less intention, but that meant I didn\u2019t have any steps built up when I woke in the morning and couldn\u2019t access my meditation videos.\nSo I had to unblock YouTube\u2014I have found myself doomscrolling or watching longform videos throughout the day, since I can\u2019t block YouTube.\nI would love a setting to choose specific times for the apps to be blocked or unblocked. I know if I didn\u2019t reset at midnight and gave myself access to apps until after I\u2019d woken up, I would end up doomscrolling in that extra time. I have no self-control.\nI Tracked Every Hour of My Day for a Week\u2014Here\u2019s What I Learned\nNo more procrastination. No more wasted time.\nI Doomscroll Even Less Than Before\nOnce I\u2019ve built up time on Steppin, I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m not doomscrolling nearly as much as I would before. Previously, I never even took notice of the time I\u2019d scroll for, and I\u2019d often spend up to two hours endlessly scrolling in a zombie state when I was \u201cjust checking my messages for five minutes.\u201d\nUnlike the iPhone Screen Time function, which I\u2019ve had set up for years, Steppin has more options for how much time you can unblock the apps for. The iPhone Screen Time options are just for one minute (which only offers that option once per day, per app), 15 minutes, or switching off for the rest of the day.\nSteppin offers minute-by-minute options up until the current maximum time you\u2019ve earned from walking. Since downloading Steppin, the idea of actively choosing 30+ minutes has horrified me. I mostly opt for just two minutes\u2014the default option\u2014or even one minute.\nThese quick times let me use social media with intention, and I\u2019ve been surprised by how long two minutes really feels in these cases. You can get a lot done in two minutes when you\u2019re not zombified.\nThe Guilt Is Real\nSteppin works on a streak-based system, similarly to Duolingo\u2014another of my daily habits. Gamified productivity works successfully because we, as humans, don\u2019t like the guilt of failure. Even when it\u2019s something as mundane as using your phone.\nThe one time I felt like I needed to use a social media app before I\u2019d earned any time, trying to choose the option to bypass the block prompted a pop-up saying I\u2019d lose my streak if I unblocked. That immediately made me feel bad, and I realized my reasoning for using the app wasn\u2019t that important. It could wait a few hours until I\u2019d got some steps in later.\nThe streak helps a lot, but even the process of unblocking an app through Steppin makes you question how much you need to use the app or your phone to begin with. Unlike the iPhone Screen Time notification, which is a one-click system, Steppin is a multi-step process. This puts more intention and interruption in your decision to use one of your blocked apps.\nWhen you first install Steppin, you set your preferences for which apps to block. Once your streak has started, changing any preferences will break your streak. This adds an extra element of guilt because it makes me question how much I really need to use a certain app or not. I kept my streak going rather than breaking it for extra use.\nI Lock My Phone in a Cupboard\u2014and 6 Other Odd Productivity Hacks\nThe weirder the hack, the better the focus.\nSteppin Has Improved My Life\nOf the many techniques I\u2019ve tried over the years to lessen my screen time or to avoid doomscrolling, installing the Steppin app has been the most successful.\nSteppin has taught me more self-control and time management about doomscrolling. I use my blocked apps or domains\u2014Instagram, Reddit, BBC News, LinkedIn, and Facebook\u2014with intention instead of mindlessly scrolling.\nI don\u2019t even use many of my earned minutes, as I choose just two minutes at a time, and with it being on my conscience, I find I don\u2019t want to scroll endlessly anymore.\nThe biggest surprise of using Steppin is learning how much time I now have in the day. I get my work done faster, often even finishing before my self-imposed no-inbox-before-midday rule is relevant, and then I go out for a walk in the middle of the day. All this extra time to be more productive in the afternoons and evenings makes me not want to doomscroll. and I\u2019d rather read a book, do some crafts, or have a conversation with someone. I don\u2019t miss doomscrolling and my life is much better off this way."

There have been many other options ive tried but none have worked quite like this one. When i saw it at first i wasnt sure if id like it, as apps like this often drain your battery or arent actually good at holding you to working for extended periods of time!! This app does all of that perfectly which is why i think it is 100% deserving of a 5 star rating.\nHowerver it is still in its early stages and i do definantly see areas that could be improved!! some things i saw mentioned that i thought were good ideas were things like sleep modes, more rooms etc. And though these are all amazing changed i would love, personally i think that the #1 thing i would like to be added is a mode that doesnt have a set timer but instead keeps track of how long uve focused. This i feel would be helpful in situations where you arent sure how long a task will take you ensuring you stay focused the whole time without having to wait for the timer to end after finishing or needing to start it again in the middle of the task! Im not quite sure how implamentable something like that would be but either way i am extatic to see this project grow and im so thankful that something like it that ACTUALLY works finally exists\nA little hack for your brain\nI installed this app a few days ago but only recently got the chance to actually try and use it and I put it to the test by starting off with a full hour focus timer as my very first. I had spent nearly twelve hours lamenting that I needed to cleanup my house and get chores done, only to get caught up (at first rightfully) in relaxing on a day off. But self care is not just relaxing and the Sisyphean force of chores must be rolled forward once again, so to this app I went. Normally when doing chores I find myself unable to stop myself from taking a \u201csmall\u201d break in between tasks, but thanks to the hour timer I set I knew I had to leave my bean alone and so kept going and going and going\u2026until suddenly not but ten minutes after my focus timer was up I had successfully finished all the chores I had been sitting on. I\u2019m excited to have a genuinely helpful app to help me stay away from my phone entirely when tasks are to be done to help prevent those \u201csmall\u201d breaks in between. I\u2019m extra curious now to see if I can also use it to focus my attention away from my phone and take care of the long term things I\u2019ve been putting off for years rather than just the pressing everyday chores staring me in the face\nMore\u2026 i want.. MORE BEAN\nSurprisingly effective! This app is really worth a try if you\u2019re having a hard time putting your phone down. The app is still very new and I\u2019m really hoping it gets updates in the future. The one downside is that there isn\u2019t much of an incentive to keep using this app after you\u2019ve decorated your bean\u2019s room, Which for me only took me 2 weeks. I wish there was more of a game aspect to make the app feel more sequentially challenging: like having to buy the cheaper, crappier furniture first before the good stuff gets unlocked. This makes the late game stuff exponentially more expensive but much more satisfying to collect. If there was a way to make scarves (the micro transaction currency) through agonizing free grinding I\u2019d be so all over this app. And I bet even more people would be tempted to buy the scarves too since a lot of ppl tend to sink cost into something that translates to real game accomplishment. Right now it seems just like dlc that\u2019s not integrated to the game.\nAgain, this app is so charming and cute. I really hope the devs keep having fun and keep playing with this idea since I\u2019ve enjoyed it so much that I kind of sunk to the bottom of the app experience already lol. I hope they find ways to make it an app that stays on people\u2019s phones for years instead of just a few months before getting deleted.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, B-Tech Consulting Group LLC, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

      "text": "After years of my phone being a productivity crutch, I've transformed it into a machine that moves me faster toward my goals. Customizing my Focus Modes to be more present has been one of the biggest game-changers in this respect.\n6 Screen Customization\nWhen I first wanted to take productivity more seriously, I noticed that what was on my screen played a huge role in how focused (or unfocused) I was. If I had distracting wallpapers and widgets, it became far too easy for me to stop working and do something else.\nBefore I knew it, I'd be distracted for the next 20 minutes and unable to get back on track. Looking for a solution to this issue, I turned to screen customization.\nWith the Focus Mode settings on my iPhone, I can pick a new screen saver when a certain mode is enabled. I can pick from patterns and images saved in my Camera Roll, along with the default ones from my iPhone gallery.\nIn addition to customizing my screensaver, I have the option to change my phone's home page if needed. If you try these and they don't work for you, turning your iPhone into a dumb phone might help (ditto if you use an Android device instead).\n5 Setting Automatic Schedules\nSmartphones often have smart schedules that activate different periods of focus based on your previous habits. While generally reliable, it helps if you don't have to wait for this to be activated. If you notice it isn't one time, you may then have to manually go into your settings.\nI don't like being side-tracked when I'm trying to work, and as a result, I set automatic daily schedules myself. With my phone, I can do this based on time; this is generally good, but I sometimes have inspiration and want to work inconsistent hours.\nThe big game-changer, in my opinion, is location-based Focus Mode scheduling. I can set this to run when I arrive at my coworking space.\nAnother option would be to activate a mode when opening an app, but to be honest, this doesn't work too well for me. Still, your mileage may vary; I therefore recommend trying it yourself.\n4 Hiding Notification Badges\nSwitching off most of my devices' notifications has been one of the easiest ways to skyrocket my productivity. When I'm working, I don't want to be disturbed by constant noise on my screen. Most notifications are simply not very important; the world won't know if I wait a few hours to reply to a text.\nWhen activating Focus Modes on my smartphone, I toggle on the Hide Notification Badges option. By doing this, I no longer see the red numbered icon on my home screen for each app I've blocked. Doing this means I have zero temptations to clear the bubble.\nBesides controlling notifications on my phone, I do the same on my computer, Apple Watch, and iPad. You can control notifications on Android, too, if you don't use an iPhone.\n3 Not Showing Notifications on the My Lock Screen\nBesides turning off notification badges, I also refuse to show notifications on my Lock Screen. When I kept this feature on and tried relying solely on willpower, I constantly got distracted. My working day was over an hour longer than it should have been because of these actions.\nTo make this change, I simply selected Silence Notifications > Always. Besides silencing notifications from apps, this feature doesn't give me incoming call notifications.\n2 Only Allowing Apps Related to My Tasks\nI've taken countless steps to limit access to distracting apps on my phone. First and foremost, I deleted all of the most distracting ones, such as Instagram and Gmail. After doing that, I used a screen time-limiting app to stop myself from any form of overconsumption.\nWhen using Focus Modes on my phone, I only allow apps related to my tasks. This means that I don't have access to my messages or anything similar. I can choose which apps I want to silence notifications from and which ones I want to enable.\nBy limiting my apps, it means that any notifications I receive are not the end of the world if I don't see them. Enabling this tool is one of the easiest ways to maximize Focus Modes on an iPhone.\n1 Using Focus Filters\nFocus Filters have been another simple but effective way to fine-tune the app access I get while I'm working. I can use these for numerous apps, such as only allowing messages from certain people. Doing this means I know that anything I get is actually urgent and worth replying to quickly.\nAnother cool feature is that I can set Deep Focus sessions with the Opal app directly in my Focus Modes settings. This makes it much easier than going into the Opal app and turning this on myself. I could add other filters, too, such as calendar ones\u2014but I personally haven't found these necessary.\nSlightly tweaking my phone's Focus Modes has been one of the simplest ways to be more present in what I'm doing. I finish my work much faster than before, and I also feel like it's easier to be present when speaking to others."

      "text": "I've tried all the same ol' productivity hacks people talk about\u2014Pomodoro timers, time-blocking, creating a to-do list the night before, waking up early to get a head start, you name it. Despite that, it's these seven odd productivity hacks that actually do the trick for me.\n7 Lock My Phone in a Cupboard\nWhether I'm studying for an exam or working, when I have my phone next to me, I always get the urge to pick it up quickly for a \"second,\" and then somehow land on TikTok or Instagram. Before I know it, I've spent a few good hours doing absolutely nothing but scrolling on my phone.\nAnd since I've already wasted so much time, what's the point of being productive now? Might as well just wrap things up for the day and start fresh the next day. This is exactly how my thought process works, and I was stuck in the same cycle for the longest time.\nSo, I started looking for ways to stop using my phone while I'm working or studying. The first thing I tried was placing it out of sight. I'd put it on the other side of the room, thinking I'd be too lazy to stand up and go all the way just to check my phone. I was wrong, and found out I was selectively lazy and would, in fact, get up just to check it.\nThen I tried screen time-limiting apps, since they have features that let you block distracting apps (or all your apps) for a certain period.\nNow, here's the issue: I'd always somehow find a loophole and bypass the restrictions. I wouldn't be a proper tech journalist if I couldn't, after all.\nOf course, doing so defeated the entire purpose of blocking apps or my phone, since I'd find some way to gain access back to them whenever I wanted. Naturally, this meant I needed a better way that would force me to stay away from my phone, no matter what I tried to do.\nSo, I decided to eliminate the distraction entirely (at least temporarily, when I needed to focus). What I do now is drop my phone into my cupboard, lock the cupboard, and then give the key to a family member. I let them know not to give it back to me no matter what I do or say.\nAll through my childhood, my mom repeated one thing: mobile phones are the biggest distraction of our time. She'd constantly call them an abomination and say that, despite the benefits they bring, they do more harm than good.\nThough I never quite understood why she was so against innocent little gadgets back then, I've come to realize she had a point, at least to an extent. Given my mom's feelings about phones, I know I can count on her for this task.\n6 Listen to Video Game Soundtracks While Working\nSome people listen to Lo-Fi beats when they want to focus, while others prefer different color sounds like white noise, brown noise, green noise, etc. A few can listen to tracks with lyrics in them, others can't. Some people enjoy having TV shows or movies playing in the background as they work, or even podcasts. Many enjoy calming tracks like the sound of rain, ocean waves, or birds chirping.\nI, on the other hand, am not particularly a fan of the above. Instead, I willingly choose to listen to video game soundtracks, and not the peaceful or ambient kind either. I\u2019m talking about tracks like the Subway Surfers soundtrack!\nPeaceful music makes me all sleepy, so why not shake things up and listen to the complete opposite? After all, an adrenaline rush is sometimes exactly what I need to stay alert.\nI had a couple of really important examinations last year, and I wouldn\u2019t be exaggerating if I said that I listened to the Subway Surfers track all day, every day. If you don\u2019t believe me, my Spotify Wrapped speaks for itself. The main theme song of Subway Surfers ended up as my top track of the year, and I\u2019m yet to recover from the embarrassment that came with that.\nNonetheless, I did end up with the grades I wanted in those exams. So though strange, this productivity hack definitely works.\n5 Ways I\u2019m Already Preparing for Next Year\u2019s Spotify Wrapped (After a Disappointing 2024)\nDon't love what you saw in Wrapped this year? You can change next year for the better.\n5 Keep My Shoes On at Home to Stay in \u201cWork Mode\u201d\nThe only place I really want to go after a tiring day of classes is my room. Even if I have a gazillion deadlines piled up, I'd much rather tackle them all one by one at home rather than head to the library or a caf\u00e9. Now, the second I get back home, I typically want to change into my comfortable pajamas right away. The next minute, my bed is calling my name, and a quick power nap doesn't sound too bad.\nPower naps have never worked for me, and once I'm asleep, it's nearly impossible to wake me up. So, I avoid them when I can. But getting comfortable almost always translates to taking a nap for me. Though I wasn't up for sacrificing my comfort, I decided to find a middle ground and sort of trick myself into thinking I'm still in \"work mode.\"\nFor me, the easiest way to do that was to simply wear my shoes at home! I'm not talking every day flip-flops. Instead, I mean actual shoes you'd wear outdoors. There've been times where I've worked while wearing heels (even in my PJs) because, somehow, that odd mix-up keeps me awake and productive.\nIf you wear makeup, another odd hack is to simply not take it off until you're done! The trick here is just tricking your brain into thinking the day isn't over yet, even if you're already home!\n4 Explain Concepts to an Imaginary Audience\nThough this one likely isn\u2019t as weird as the rest of the tricks I\u2019m covering in this article, I was surprised to find out that barely anyone I know has the habit of explaining stuff to an imaginary audience. Unlike the rest, this one's actually backed by science.\nIt's essentially a method of active recall, which is a learning technique that encourages you to actively retrieve information from your memory rather than just passively reading your notes again and again.\n6 Ways to Use Active Learning to Take Better Notes\nWant to supercharge your note-taking skills? Here are some effective ways to use active learning techniques and take better notes.\nActive recall is meant to strengthen your memory and improve long-term retention. While flashcards are one of the best ways to use active recall, it can sometimes get boring and repetitive. A good way to shake things up (while still practicing active recall) is to close your notes and teach everything you've learned to someone else.\nNow, when my sisters were younger, I'd force them to sit with me and listen to me explain the difference between covalent and ionic bonds. Now that they're older, it's not easy to get a hold of them and force them to listen to me explain something just for my own good! So, I had to get creative... I began explaining what I was studying to an imaginary audience.\nI'd sometimes close my eyes and pretend I was a teacher, and other times I'd explain my concepts to my stuffed toys! I've also taught multiple topics to the pets I've had over the years. It's a bit silly, but it works.\n3 Turn My Notes into Songs (or Strange Mnemonics)\nSometimes, no matter what I do, there's some information that just won't stick in my brain. One minute I remember it, the next minute I don't. For concepts I need to master, explaining them to an imaginary audience works. But memorizing specific terms is a whole different battle. Fortunately, turning such things into songs or mnemonics never fails me. The stranger the song or mnemonic is, the better I\u2019ll remember it.\nDuring my GCSEs, I needed to remember the important rivers in my country: Jhelum, Sutlej, Swat, Ravi, Hub, Chenab, Kabul, Chitral, Dasht, Hingol, Zhob, Indus, and Mula. Sound strange? My sixteen-year-old self thought so too.\nSo, I decided to use Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Kim Kardashian, and Zayn Malik to remember! Here's the mnemonic I used (that I still remember to this day):\nJustin said Selena rejected him, so he called Kim. Chaotic drama happened. Zayn intensely meditated.\nIf you like singing, turn it into a song with the strangest lyrics ever. Recalling the song lyrics can get a bit awkward during exam conditions, but hey, it's your grade on the line.\n2 Send Someone a Risky Text\nIf you don\u2019t want to quite lock your phone in the cupboard, I have another way (that\u2019s almost always guaranteed to work) to keep you away from your phone. If you have a thought you\u2019ve been keeping from someone, a confession you\u2019ve wanted to send, a message you\u2019ve been nervous to share, or just a risky text in general, you can use it to your advantage.\nSend it right before you need to focus on a task. Every time I\u2019ve sent a risky text, even if it wasn\u2019t something to be particularly scared about, I\u2019ve always avoided picking up my phone, afraid of what the recipient might say! So, just save a risky text you need to send for when you need to focus on a task.\n1 Film Myself Working in a Time-Lapse\nIf you\u2019d rather keep your phone right next to you when you\u2019re focusing on a task, and don\u2019t really have a risky text you need to send, another odd way to stay focused is to record a time-lapse of yourself doing it. Since all modern phones come with a built-in time-lapse mode, you don\u2019t need any extra equipment or even a third-party app.\nJust prop your phone up, switch to the Time-Lapse mode in your device\u2019s native Camera app, and get going. Knowing that recording it will give me a sped-up video of all my hard work, I\u2019m always tempted to keep going until I finish the task.\nIf the abundance of productivity hacks out there just don\u2019t work for you, try some of the ones I\u2019ve covered above. The unconventional nature of them might make you hesitant to try, but don\u2019t knock \u2019em until you\u2019ve given them a fair shot. Who knows, you might just find one that actually clicks."

      "text": "Staying focused during exam prep felt impossible until I started using these tools. They help me lock in, pace myself, and actually retain what I study without burning out.\n5 Notion\nIf you\u2019re a student, I\u2019m pretty sure you already know about Notion. But if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re really missing out.\nNotion is basically an all-in-one app where you can take notes, organize your schedule, track your habits, and plan out your entire week. It\u2019s super flexible, and that\u2019s what makes it so good for students. You can set it up however you want. It could be something simple like your to-do list, or even something more complex like a full-on study dashboard.\nFor example, if you\u2019re a computer science student, you could have separate pages for each subject, with lecture notes, important concepts, and even practice questions all in one place categorized neatly. You could even add code snippets or link pages together to make it easier to revise later. This setup saves me a lot of time since I don\u2019t have to dig through my entire file manager every time I need to find something.\nI use Notion for pretty much running my entire life. It\u2019s where I keep all my notes, deadlines, and revision plans. I\u2019ve even built my own templates for tracking topics I\u2019ve studied and what I still need to work on. Since everything is in one place, I don\u2019t have to switch between apps or open a browser, which really helps me stay focused.\nDownload: Notion (Free)\n4 Pomofocus\nIf you\u2019ve never used a Pomodoro timer before, the idea is pretty simple. You work for a set amount of time, usually 25 minutes, then take a short break before starting the next session. After a few cycles, you take a longer break. This method works well because your brain tends to stay more focused when it knows a break is coming soon. It\u2019s just long enough to get into a flow, but not so long that you burn out.\nPomofocus is a clean and easy-to-use Pomodoro timer that runs right in your browser. You can quickly start a 25-minute work session with a 5-minute break, or switch to longer sessions depending on how much you want to get done. It\u2019s perfect for study blocks or revision marathons.\nI usually use the tasks section in Pomofocus to jot down everything I want to finish during a study session. Then I just let the timer run, take a break when it tells me to, and repeat the process until I\u2019m done with everything. It keeps me from feeling overwhelmed since I\u2019m only focusing on one chunk at a time.\nYou also get basic stats to track how many sessions you\u2019ve completed, and there\u2019s even a weekly leaderboard if a bit of friendly competition helps you stay motivated.\nVisit: Pomofocus (Free)\n3 Discord\nI know this sounds kind of odd, but Discord is actually a pretty excellent study app in two ways.\nFirst, there are some great study-focused servers out there, like the Study Together server. You can join a public voice chat where everyone\u2019s either sharing their screen or has their camera on while studying.\nThe idea is to create a sense of accountability\u2014you\u2019re only allowed to do something productive while you\u2019re in the VC, and everyone stays muted and deafened, so there are no distractions. It\u2019s surprisingly effective if you struggle with staying on task.\nThere\u2019s even a full ranking system based on how many hours you\u2019ve studied, and you can check your personal stats too. If you\u2019re stuck on a topic, you can ask for help on the server. It\u2019s a pretty big community, and usually someone\u2019s around to lend a hand.\nThe second way I use Discord is by creating a private server with just me in it. I set up separate channels for different subjects or topics, and just message myself whenever I come across a doubt or question. It\u2019s quicker than opening Notion sometimes, and it acts like a searchable, running log of things I want to come back to.\nDownload: Discord (Free)\n2 Todoist\nI usually prefer writing down my daily tasks on paper since it helps me stay grounded, but when I\u2019m working on something more complex\u2014like prepping for finals, managing multiple assignments, or handling a long-term project\u2014paper just doesn\u2019t cut it. That\u2019s where Todoist really shines.\nThe Projects feature is my go-to. It lets you create a dedicated space for each subject or task, and then break that down into subtasks with deadlines, labels, and priorities. It\u2019s especially useful when you want a clear view of everything that needs to be done without feeling overwhelmed by one giant to-do list.\nWhen I'm deep into a study phase, Todoist becomes my project manager; it keeps me accountable, organized, and a lot less stressed.\nDownload: Todoist (Free)\n1 Dark Noise\nListening to white noise helps me focus a lot better, and I\u2019ve noticed that I actually get some of my best work done on flights. There\u2019s something about that constant background hum that keeps my brain from drifting off. That\u2019s why I use Dark Noise.\nIt\u2019s an app that lets you generate different types of ambient sounds to help you stay calm, focused, and locked in while studying.\nYou can technically generate white noise using the built-in options on your iPhone or Mac, but Dark Noise offers way more variety and control. I\u2019ve been using it for years now, and it\u2019s been super reliable throughout. It\u2019s one of those apps I always have running in the background during long study sessions.\nThe only downside is that Dark Noise is limited to macOS and iPadOS. But if you\u2019re on Windows, there\u2019s an app called White Noise on the Microsoft Store that works pretty well (very subtle name, I know). Or you can always turn to YouTube, which has an endless supply of white noise and ambient mixes to choose from.\nDownload: Dark Noise (Free, in-app purchases available)\nThere are plenty of other methods that can help you focus while studying\u2014what matters most is finding what actually works for you. With that said, best of luck with your study sessions; you\u2019ve got this!"
