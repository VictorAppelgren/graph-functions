  "title": "Tottenham Hotspur return to the biggest stage \u2013 but have they narrowed the gap on the elite?",
  "description": "Spurs will play in first the UEFA Super Cup, then the Champions League this season - fans are worried they have not strengthened enough",
  "content": "When Cristian Romero leads Tottenham Hotspur out in Udine on Wednesday evening, he will be taking them into uncharted territory.\n\nSpurs have never previously played in the UEFA Super Cup, the glamorous opening night of the European club season. This is by definition an elite event, an invitation-only high-rollers\u2019 table. UEFA does not just let anyone in behind the velvet rope. You have to look like you belong there.\n\nAnd when Spurs emerge from the tunnel at the Stadio Friuli, they may be briefly dazzled by the shine of silver. They will see the Europa League trophy that they won in May, their buy-in for this game. They will see the Super Cup trophy, the pot they are going for on the night. And the Champions League trophy too, that Paris Saint-Germain brought with them. Tottenham will be competing for that over the course of this season, aiming to make it to Budapest almost 10 months from now to win it for themselves.\n\nDuring every game that Tottenham play in the Champions League this season \u2014 and there will be eight at least \u2014 they will have a badge on the right sleeve of their shirt, one that will be seen for the first time on their all-white kit on Wednesday. UEFA calls it the \u2018Europa League titleholder badge\u2019 and it will remind the world of what Tottenham achieved in Bilbao and why they are playing these games.\n\nSo Wednesday is in one sense part of the spoils of victory, the rewards for beating Manchester United in that famous final. No one can argue against the notion that they deserve to be there. But in another sense, this is a test. Spurs are right back among the elite here, facing the best team in the world. This is going to be a severe test of their credentials. And while deserving to be invited there is one thing, belonging at the top table is quite another.\n\nFor an occasion like this, you want to arrive looking your best. But the problem for Spurs is they will have to field a team some way short of the level fans would want from them this year. Their two best creative midfielders, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, are both out. They have not signed a No 10 to replace them. Their move for Morgan Gibbs-White stalled in July, and supporters were left frustrated at the failure to move on to other targets.\n\nWhile Mohammed Kudus and Joao Palhinha are both good additions, Spurs clearly still need more, and the mood of the fanbase has returned to being negative. Combine this with Son Heung-min\u2019s departure and the Tottenham team that takes the field will not exactly look intimidating on paper. Certainly compared to Spurs teams of the recent past, who would go into big European games with Son and Harry Kane up front. If Thomas Frank\u2019s side are to get a result on Wednesday, they will have to be canny, resourceful and imaginative. They cannot just rely on individual qualities any more.\n\nIt makes you think about how Spurs will compete with teams like PSG this season. For years this has been one of the great unanswered questions about Tottenham Hotspur: are they a truly elite club? Is this their genuine level, competing with the richest and best teams in the world, for the biggest trophies?\n\nSome would argue that they are now among the giants of the world game. They certainly have some strong reasons to be bracketed there. The stadium, home to NFL and Beyonce. The training ground, one of the best in Europe. The global fanbase, with Spurs especially popular in the U.S. and in south-east Asia. The proud history, taking in some of the true greats of the game. The assortment of brilliant players and managers they have had in more recent years. When the European Super League was briefly proposed in April 2021, Tottenham had a seat at the table, not that the club likes to sing proudly about that now.\n\nOn the other side of the argument, you have heard it all before. People might point to the relative dearth of major trophies, the 17-year gap between the 2008 League Cup and the 2025 Europa League, the fact that their last league title was in 1961.\n\nPerhaps the biggest issue, the biggest question regarding whether Tottenham fit in at the very top, concerns the last few years in the Champions League. When Spurs reached the final in Madrid in 2019 it felt like one of the great moments in the club\u2019s modern history. Especially coming less than two months after the opening of the new stadium. It felt for a short while as if Tottenham was now the centre of the football world. You could see the 2020s rolling out in front of you, Spurs constantly hosting Champions League games in their new home. Their elite status would be unambiguous.\n\nThe reality has been different. Tottenham\u2019s impact on the Champions League since the 2019 final in Madrid has been negligible at best. They have had two campaigns after the 2019 final, not including the one that starts next month. Both of those have been utterly forgettable. Both times they have limped out in the last-16 stage, against RB Leipzig in 2020 and Milan in 2023. There has been almost nothing happy or memorable or even interesting about any of it. The sad truth about these last two Champions League campaigns is that the single most memorable game was losing 7-2 at home to Bayern Munich, in the dying days of the Mauricio Pochettino era.\n\nAnd over the course of those years, whether outside of the Champions League, or doing nothing in it, Spurs started to lose some of that status they built at the end of the last decade. They started to look further away again from the level they always aspired to. In the 2023-24 campaign, they did not play any European football at all. There is nothing that bruises the ego of any club quite like a season of midweeks spent at home watching European football on TV. Even the Europa Conference League starts to look exotic and glamorous after a while.\n\nOne of the many good things about Spurs winning the Europa League is that they do not have to worry about the long slog of the Conference League or Europa League this year. They are straight back into the Champions League, for the first time since the final days of the Antonio Conte era. If the end of last season is anything to go by, they may face some carping about whether they deserve their place there, whether winning the Europa League justifies their place.\n\nThis is why Wednesday\u2019s game could be so important. It is not that Tottenham need to bring this trophy back to north London. Spurs have never even played for this particular one before. And this club has lasted 143 years already without ever holding onto the Super Cup. Whatever happens in Udine, Burnley on Saturday afternoon will become the dominant question soon enough.\n\nWhat might matter more than the trophy itself is the ego boost that would come from victory. All of the questions about whether Tottenham deserve to be here in the VIP section, deserve to be back in the Champions League, would be silenced in an instant. All they have to do is go out and beat the best team in the world.\n\nIt is a big ask for any side. Especially for a Spurs side playing their first competitive game under a new manager, who for all his many strengths has little experience at the top end of the European game. And for a Spurs side who have only added two players to the first 11 this window, while selling Son and losing Maddison to a knee injury. This is arguably now the Spurs side with the least star quality in for a generation.\n\nThe danger is that they show up to Udine looking short on quality, short on nous, short on everything you would expect from a team who knows what it takes at this level. They will just have to find a way to stay in the game, to keep it tight, to prove that they belong at this top table after all. That could even be a bigger prize than a trophy at the end.",

      "text": "Tottenham Hotspur head coach Thomas Frank has said the club \u201cneed to look into\u201d a replacement for James Maddison after his \u201cdevastating\u201d anterior cruciate ligament injury.\nFrank spoke after Tottenham\u2019s friendly 4-0 defeat to Bayern Munich after the club confirmed earlier on Thursday that the 28-year-old midfielder requires surgery on the right knee injury he sustained during Sunday\u2019s game against Newcastle United.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe are definitely in the market in general,\u201d Frank said when asked if the injury escalates their search for a No 10. \u201cOf course, when players get a long term injury we need to look into that.\n\u201c(The injury is) devastating news for the team and for Maddison.

      "text": "You may not want to do this. In fact, it would be a bizarre way to choose to spend your time in these final days of August before football returns. But think back for a minute to some of the goals Tottenham Hotspur conceded in the Premier League last season.\nThere were quite a few of them.\nSpurs\u2019 opponents scored 65 times \u2014 their worst defensive record of the 38-game Premier League era. And among the 65, there were some recurring issues. Spurs fans often felt like they were watching their side concede the same goals over and over again.\nAdvertisement\nTake the one where a player cuts in from out wide and finds himself on the edge of the penalty area with far more time and space than he would normally expect. He looks up, picks his spot, and finds it before anyone even bothers to challenge him.\nExamples include Chelsea\u2019s Jadon Sancho at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Hugo Ekitike of Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, Diego Gomez for Brighton, or Boubacar Kamara at Villa Park, or Wolves\u2019 Rayan Ait-Nouri at Molineux, or Alexis Mac Allister for Liverpool at Anfield, o\u2026 well, you get the picture.\nThen there\u2019s the one where the opposition simply break away down the middle of the pitch, with very little resistance from anyone in a Spurs shirt.\nMohamed Salah scored goals like that home and away for Liverpool last season. His team-mate Dominik Szoboszlai added another in north London. Matheus Cunha away to Wolves. Eberechi Eze for visitors Crystal Palace. Iliman Ndiaye at Everton. We could go on.\nIt was glaringly clear last season that this was not sustainable. Tottenham were never going to get anywhere conceding goals like these week after week.\nAt the end of the campaign, they changed head coach, with Ange Postecoglou being replaced by Brentford counterpart Thomas Frank. And while part of the issue might have been down to tactics, with Postecoglou\u2019s attacking approach sometimes leaving Spurs open on the break, it also comes down to personnel.\nIt has been years since Tottenham last had a serious defensive midfielder.\nLast season, they rotated between Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma in that role, but neither provided the back line and goalkeeper with the necessary protection. Bentancur is better driving forward, and does not have quite the same engine he had during his first few years at the club. Bissouma did not have a good season in the league, although he was integral to the climax of the European campaign. Both were brilliant in the Europa League final against Manchester United.\nAdvertisement\nSo when Frank arrived two months ago, he knew how important a new deep-lying No 6 was for this midfield.\nSpurs have not fielded anyone like that since they let Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg go to Marseille last summer, on an initial loan deal that has now become permanent, following a 2023-24 league season in which he made 36 appearances under Postecoglou but only eight starts. You could easily imagine Hojbjerg fitting in well under Frank, not least because he coached him as a teenager in their native Denmark, but even then, he was always more of a scurrier than a sitter in the middle of the pitch.\n\u201cWhen I came in and assessed the squad, it was an area where I thought we could need something there,\u201d Frank told reporters when asked about holding midfielders during Spurs\u2019 pre-season tour to Hong Kong and South Korea. \u201cI know the squad and the team, and I watched extra (games) before I went in. But it\u2019s always different when you then walk in and you feel (the players), you touch them, you work with them.\u201d\nFrank was keen to add a player with those specifically defensive skills this summer, which leads us to Joao Palhinha, who has just joined on a season\u2019s loan from Bayern Munich \u2014 the club he will likely make his Tottenham debut against in Thursday\u2019s away pre-season friendly at the Allianz Arena. \u201cIf you look at the squad, I don\u2019t think we have his ability or package as a clear No 6 with his profile,\u201d Frank said. \u201cRodri Bentancur can play there as well, but they could complement each other well in there.\u201d\nPalhinha offers skills nobody else in the Spurs squad has, a fact highlighted by the positions he took up during his two years in the Premier League with Fulham before joining Bayern last summer (below).\nHe stood out as a midfielder who was uncompromisingly, unapologetically destructive.\nHis ability to read the game and then wrap one of his long legs around the ball made him very difficult to play past. He was integral to Fulham finishing 10th in their first season back in the top flight, their first top-half finish since 2012. Palhinha ranked top across Europe\u2019s \u2018Big Five\u2019 leagues for tackles in both of his years at Craven Cottage (148 and 152).\nAdvertisement\nTottenham could do with a bit of that.\nFrank knows they need extra security against the counter-attack. The centre-backs, as good as they are, need some protection in front of them. Palhinha is the perfect player to provide it.\n\u201cHis defensive qualities, his ability to be in the centre of the pitch, very disciplined, his distribution, short, diagonal (passes) in behind and then his ability to break up play,\u201d said Frank, listing his qualities. \u201cEspecially if you are playing away from home or against good counter-attacking teams. It\u2019s very important to have one that is not running away or gets attracted to something.\u201d\nEven though Frank likes Bentancur, and will want youngsters Lucas Bergvall and Archie Gray to continue their first-team development \u2014 remember that he planned to use the latter in midfield when he nearly joined Brentford from Leeds last summer \u2014 there are still some hugely important issues for Tottenham to fix. Not least the question of how they generate chances, given the injuries to James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski. They will surely have to go back into the market to add more creative quality.\nBut there were plenty of times last season when Spurs looked as if they were paying the price for failing to sign an experienced defensive midfielder, the type of player this group needed so much. Away from home, against counter-attacking teams, their midfielders would too often get dragged out of position, unable to stop the break.\nMaybe Palhinha can help end that.\n(Top photo: Jacques Feeney/Getty Images)"
