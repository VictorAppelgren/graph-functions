  "description": "A pregnant Massachusetts teenager sent a chilling final text to a friend, voicing a sense that something felt 'off' shortly before she disappeared without a trace.",
  "content": "A pregnant Massachusetts teenager sent a chilling final text to a friend, voicing a sense that something felt 'off' shortly before she disappeared without a trace.\n\nKylee Monteiro, 18, who her family says was 11 weeks pregnant, vanished on August 7 after she was last seen near Country Street in Rehoboth. Her last known location was her boyfriend\u2019s house to grab some things, family members told Boston 25 News.\n\nFears are only intensifying in the desperate search, as Kylee's family revealed she had recently argued with her boyfriend - and her haunting final message expressed fear for her safety.\n\n'I don't feel safe right now something's not right,' she texted her friend before she stopped responding completely, according to WCVB News.\n\n'It\u2019s been very difficult, we\u2019re very scared,' Kylee\u2019s sister, Faith Monteiro told ABC 6 News.\n\n'We hope she\u2019s ok, this is not like her at all, she would never just disappear, the circumstances don\u2019t seem good,' she added.\n\n'I have so many theories just like everybody else, like I said it\u2019s a lot of speculation. We really don\u2019t know what happened.'\n\nOn Monday, the Rehoboth Police Department issued a press release about Kylee\u2019s sudden and out-of-character disappearance.\n\nThe statement described the teen as last seen wearing a red T-shirt bearing the phrase \u2018Get Over It\u2019 and likely carrying a white bag she was frequently seen with.\n\nKylee, who graduated from Attleboro High School in June, had been living in a homeless shelter for several weeks amid an 'on and off' relationship with her boyfriend, her sister, Faith, told ABC News.\n\nAccording to Faith, her sister's relationship involved \u2018domestic issues,\u2019 including an incident that allegedly took place the night before she disappeared.\n\nOn the evening of August 6, Kylee reportedly called Faith and several others after an argument with her boyfriend, expressing fear not only for her safety but for her very life.\n\nAlthough Kylee reportedly told her sister that the argument had settled, she was still described as frantic - her tone conveying an urgent, unspoken plea for help.\n\n'She was desperate for help,' Faith told ABC. 'She was calling out to friends, family, anyone she could, telling them that she was in danger. The whole situation is very scary.'\n\nFaith immediately offered to pick her up, but Kylee declined. Still, Faith said her sister wasn\u2019t the type to ask a stranger for a ride and 'doesn\u2019t know how to survive on her own.'\n\n'The last known time when we heard her voice was Wednesday night,' Faith added to WCVB News.\n\nKitty Monteiro, another sister of Kylee's, wrote to Facebook: 'It\u2019s highly unlike her to cut all contact from social media and family. We need to get word out to find any information as soon as possible.'\n\nKylee\u2019s last known contact came the day after the phone calls, when she sent a friend the eerie, context-free text message that would be her final communication.\n\n'I tried talking with her after that, and she just stopped responding to me after that,' the unidentified friend told WCVB.\n\n'I just want her to know that like, we miss you, and we're not going to stop trying to find you.'\n\nOn Tuesday, several officers - including a K-9 unit and dive team - were seen searching along County Street, according to WPRI News.\n\nSo far, searches have included wooded areas, a nearby pond, and homes around the area where Kylee was last seen - but have turned up nothing.\n\nOn Wednesday, a full police presence was back on the ground, spending hours combing through previously unsearched areas, as reported by ABC 6.\n\n'There\u2019s a little bit of relief knowing that there\u2019s people out there looking for her and they\u2019re not going to stop until they find her,' Faith told the outlet. 'But if they don\u2019t find her, I don\u2019t know what the next steps are, and that is worrying to me.'\n\nKylee is described as 6 feet tall, with light brown hair and brown eyes. In addition to her red 'Get Over It' T-shirt, she was last seen wearing ripped blue jeans and tan boots.\n\n'She\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s so friendly and lovable, she\u2019s outgoing, but also timid at the same time,' Faith added. 'She doesn\u2019t have survival instinct to survive out here on her own. That\u2019s for sure.'\n\n'We just have to keep hope that she\u2019s out there.'\n\nAnyone with information or surveillance footage from the area is urged to contact the Rehoboth Police Department at (508) 252-3722.",

      "text": "Family desperate to find missing pregnant 18-year-old from Massachusetts\nKylee Monteiro has been missing since Aug. 7, according to police.\nA search is underway for an 18-year-old woman who disappeared a week ago from Rehoboth, Massachusetts, police and her family said.\nKylee Monteiro is 11 weeks pregnant and has been missing since Aug. 7, her sister told ABC News.\n\"This is not like her at all. This is completely unusual and very scary, to say the least,\" Faith Monteiro said Thursday.\nKylee Monteiro, who had just graduated from Attleboro High School two and a half months ago, was last seen in the area of County Street in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, the Rehoboth Police Department said in a press release on Monday.\nHer sister said the 18-year-old had been living at a homeless shelter for pregnant women in Pembroke, Massachusetts, for the past few weeks as her and her boyfriend were \"on and off\" and that there had been \"domestic issues\" in the relationship, including an altercation that allegedly occurred the night before she disappeared.\nAfter an alleged argument on Aug. 6, Kylee Monteiro allegedly called her sister, along with several others, saying the dispute had calmed down but she was fearful for her life, her sister said.\n\"She was desperate for help. She was calling out to friends, family, anyone she could, telling them that she was in danger. The whole situation is very scary,\" Faith Monteiro told ABC News.\nFaith Monteiro said she told the 18-year-old that she could pick her up, but she declined.\nHer sister said the teen is \"not the type of person\" to ask a stranger for a ride and \"doesn't know how to survive on her own.\"\nThe Rehoboth Police Department and the Bristol County District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\nHer sister said Kylee Monteiro was \"really excited\" to become a mom.\n\"She even had a name picked out for the baby. If she had a girl, she was going to name the baby Eleanor,\" her sister said.\nThe teen's whole family is \"worried sick\" and \"just want her to come home immediately,\" Faith Monteiro said.\n\"I love her, I miss her,\" she said.\nThe teen is described as approximately 6 feet tall with brown hair, police said. She was last seen wearing a red t-shirt with the phrase \"Get Over It\" printed on the front, ripped blue jeans and tan boots, according to the police press release.\nShe may have been carrying a white bag with her belongings inside, police said.\nAnyone with more information regarding Kylee Monteiro's disappearance or whereabouts -- or residents in the area with video surveillance -- are urged to contact the Rehoboth Police Department immediately."
