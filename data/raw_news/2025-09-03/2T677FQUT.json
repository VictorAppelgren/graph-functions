  "title": "Alexander Isak 'refuses to speak on international duty' as statement made",
  "description": "Alexander Isak recently completed his contentious \u00a3125million transfer to Liverpool from Newcastle.",
  "content": "Alexander Isak is reportedly snubbing all media duties while on international duty with Sweden, just days after sealing a British transfer record to Liverpool. The summer\u2019s most controversial saga came to an end on deadline day when Newcastle finally relented and allowed Isak to make his \u00a3125million switch to Merseyside. Having watched their talisman effectively go on strike, sitting out the first three Premier League games of the season, Newcastle responded with a blunt 37-word statement announcing the transfer.\n\nIsak can look to pastures new at Liverpool, but first, he has World Cup qualifying matches against Slovenia and Kosovo to tend to. The 25-year-old can get up to speed with Sweden, having sat out the majority of pre-season, and build towards a debut for Liverpool, potentially against Burnley, upon his return to the UK. But Swedish outlet Fotboll Skanalen claim that Isak has decided to snub all media duties with the national team, despite speaking openly to Liverpool\u2019s club website about his recent transfer. Sweden\u2019s press officer Petra Thoren said: \u201cAlexander will not do any media ahead of the match against Slovenia. \u201cWe are in dialogue with Alexander on this issue. But given the circumstances of his coming in late on Monday, it\u2019s not long until the World Cup qualifiers, he wants to focus on preparations and getting started properly and preparing for the matches.\u201d For the latest breaking stories and headlines, sign up to our Daily Express LFC newsletter.\n\nWhen asked if Isak would speak after the Slovenia match, Thoren replied: \u201cI don\u2019t guarantee that he will be available to the media at any time during this period. But I also don\u2019t rule out that it could be that way. We\u2019re taking it day by day. It\u2019s an ongoing dialogue. Alex\u2019s focus and desire right now is to put all his energy into preparations for the matches.\u201d Isak\u2019s sole focus is on the pitch after becoming public enemy number one in Newcastle. After the club\u2019s short and icy announcement of his big-money move to Liverpool, Isak issued a statement on social media reflecting on his time on Tyneside.\n\n\"I want to express my gratitude to my teammates, the staff, and above all, the city of Newcastle and all the amazing supporters for the three unforgettable years we shared together,\u201d Isak wrote. \"Together, we have written history and brought the club to the place where it truly belongs. It has been an honour to be part of the journey from reaching the Champions League to winning the first trophy in over 70 years. But those looking forward to fresh words from Isak may be left waiting, at least until Sweden\u2019s match with Slovenia on Friday evening.",
