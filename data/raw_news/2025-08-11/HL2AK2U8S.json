  "content": "A Miami model is being criticized for spending more than $1 million on cosmetic procedures to achieve one of the world\u2019s smallest waistlines at 18 inches \u2014 which she protects by wearing a corset for an astonishing 23 hours a day.\n\nAleira Avendano, 33, has endured considerable backlash over her bizarre regimen \u2014 with trolls branding her body \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a major investment \u2014 enhancements, treatments and healthy food,\u201d Avendano, who only unbinds herself to shower, told NeedToKnow, calling her lengthy journey \u201cA huge commitment. Honestly, my body should be insured.\u201d\n\nTo complement her million-dollar middle, Avendano has spent an additional $638,000 on seven boob jobs, five nose jobs, butt implants and new teeth, over nearly two decades.\n\nBut the cost of her jaw-dropping figure hasn\u2019t just taken a toll on her wallet.\n\n\u201cThis is not just the result of hard work \u2013 [it is] often physically painful,\u201d Avendano confessed, admitting that constantly wearing corsets has caused her organs to \u201cshift\u201d and \u201cadjust\u201d to the snug squeeze.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the other major pain she faces \u2014 getting dressed.\n\n\u201cI find it challenging when it comes to buying clothes, as nothing fits,\u201d the yoga teacher groaned.\n\n\u201cMy sizes are unique, and I have naturally wide hips,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I have to have clothes custom-made for me.\u201d\n\nAnd while she\u2019s routinely pelted with hate for her controversial curves, Avendano shrugs it off. \u201cI don\u2019t miss my old figure at all,\u201d she insisted.\n\n\u201cPeople react in different ways,\u201d said the content creator, with over 1.1 million Instagram subscribers. \u201cSome follow me, some feel nervous, and others admire me or see my body as something crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen can\u2019t get enough of my exotic figure,\u201d she bragged. \u201cI love it. I am one-of-a-kind now.\u201d\n\nBarely-there bellies are hotly en vogue thanks to VIP voluptuaries \u00e0 la Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, leaders in the corset-fashion charge.\n\nBut the vixen encourages copycats to tread lightly. She suggests folks begin strapping into the shapewear for just six hours per day, slowly increasing the wear-time up to two hours each week.\n\nAvendano is poised to launch a line of corsets and shapewear so that \u201cpeople all over the world can achieve a similar figure with time and discipline.\u201d",

The unflattering ranking came to light via a Reddit post that raised eyebrows online.\n\u201cIn 2007, Maxim thought it was clever to publish a list of \u2018Unsexiest Women Alive,'\u201d the Reddit poster wrote. \u201cHere are the 5 women they selected.\u201d\nSJP was named the \u201cunsexiest woman alive,\u201d with the men\u2019s mag describing her as the \u201cleast sexy woman in a group of very unsexy women,\u201d per an article from the time on Today.com.\n\u201cHow the hell did this [racehorse] Barbaro-faced broad manage to \u2026 star on a show with \u2018sex\u2019 in the title?\u201d it read, per news.com.au.\nComing in second in this not-hot 100 was Amy Winehouse. The \u201cRehab\u201d singer, who died four years later of alcohol poisoning, was lambasted for her supposed \u201copenly hemorrhaging translucent skin, rat\u2019s nest mane and lashes that look more like surgically attached bats.\u201d\n\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d star Sandra Oh placed third on this famous person \u201cface mash,\u201d which the Maxim scribes attributed to her \u201ccold bedside manner and boyish figure.\u201d\n\u201cSelf-righteous bellyaching and rapid postnuptial deterioration\u201d landed pop sensation Madonna in fourth place, with the mag comparing her to \u201cNosferatu\u201d actor Willem Dafoe.\nBritney Spears, who was in the throes of her highly publicized meltdown at the time, rounded out the so-called cosmetically catastrophic quintet due to her perceived weight gain and turbulent personal life.\nMaxim derided the pop princess as \u201cfilling chicken-grease-stained sweatpants on the cover of every trashy tabloid and gossip blog on the Internet\u201d and having \u201cgained two kids, two useless ex-husbands, and about 23 pounds of Funyun pudge,\u201d per Pajiba.com.\nThe body-shaming hit list came out as a veritable Razzie Awards to the mag\u2019s Oscars, its Hot 100 list, which was released earlier that year.\nComing in first place on that list was Lindsay Lohan, followed by Jessica Alba, Scarlett Johansson and Christina Aguilera.\nThankfully, even the oft-merciless Redditors were horrified by the derogatory piece. \u201cExcuse the f\u2013k out of me?\u201d sputtered one commenter, while another wrote, \u201cNever understood the criticism for SJP\u2019s looks.\u201d\n\u201cAll these women are hot? Wtf,\u201d exclaimed a third.\nSome chalked up the list to the ridiculous beauty standards of the aughts.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk enough about how ridiculously cruel the 2000s were to women\u2019s bodies,\u201d said another. \u201cJessica Simpson could not dare to add half a pound without some low life tabloid turning it [into a] headline.\u201d\n\u201cSo, two Jewish women with prominent noses, an Asian woman, a 49-year-old woman, and a woman who had recently aged out of her sexy-baby marketing,\u201d rued one critic. \u201cLet\u2019s call it like it is, none of these women fit into the Eurocentric-blonde-hair-button-nose-big-boob-flat-tummy-\u2018good-genes\u2019-barely-legal category, so sadly I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\nOthers thought the article was especially hypocritical given how most of the writers behind said countdowns generally weren\u2019t easy on the eyes themselves.\n\u201cIt should be mandatory for anyone who publishes articles like this to post a picture of themselves beside their work,\u201d declared one appalled reader.\nPajiba writer Kayleigh Donaldson pointed out that the article was even reviled at the time, writing that many media outlets deemed it in \u201cshockingly poor taste and stunningly sexist\u201d despite celeb body-shaming being in vogue.\n\u201cEveryone engaged in this circle of human bear-baiting, with this handful of women held up as the acceptable targets,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe word \u2018trainwreck\u2019 had never been more utilized in the media vernacular.\u201d\nSarah Jessica Parker spoke out about how much the article upset her.\n\u201cAm I really the unsexiest woman in the world?\u201d the actress said in an interview with Grazia magazine, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cWow! It\u2019s kind of shocking.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s so brutal in a way, so filled with rage and anger.\u201d"

The \u201cEspresso\u201d singing siren has, too, debuted a slew of sparkling corsets during her \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d tour stops.\nHer fellow songstress, Swift, 35, has been spotted sporting the rib-hugging garb for both formal and casual occasions.\nMusic\u2019s \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d rocked a yellow, green and black zip-up corset via Christian Dior at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. She also wore a waist-withering Versace cinched Medusa denim bustier \u2014 while cheering on NFL boyfriend Travis Kelce from the sidelines last fall.\nBut it\u2019s pop culture\u2019s Queen Bey and her eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, 13, who\u2019ve served as the \u201ccore\u201d of the viral corset craze.\nThe \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d chanteuse, 43, just stunned in a stylish white \u2018set \u2014 similar to the one Pamela Anderson, 57, legendarily squeezed into for the 1999 VMAs.\nAnd to toast the forthcoming launch of her hair care line at Ulta Beauty shops, Beyonc\u00e9 wowed signature corsetry from Vivienne Westwood in an Instagram announcement.\nThe Grammy winner\u2019s preteen daughter slayed a custom crystal-covered corset for their side-by-side performance at the Houston Texans vs. Baltimore Ravens game on Christmas, proving that the fitted finery knows no age limits \u2014 nor does it take any days off from being haute.\nAnd despite the tightness of their grip, Work hails corsets as \u201cliberating\u201d gear for glamour gals across generations, from Gen Alphas to Baby Boomers.\n\u201cWomen, especially here in New York City, are free to wear whatever we want to express ourselves,\u201d the fashion pro said. \u201cThe corset offers a really feminine silhouette, it accentuates curves and helps us embrace our natural bodies.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s liberating.\u201d"

It\u2019s not extreme, it\u2019s smart.\u201d\nCarrie noted that food, water, shelter and power are most important, followed by self-defense items and then communication tools.\n15 essential doomsday bunker items for preppers:\n\u2022 Water filtration & purification (portable filter, purification tablets/drops)\n\u2022 Stored water supply (at least one gallon per person per day)\n\u2022 Emergency food supply (freeze-dried meals, canned goods, rations)\n\u2022 Fire-starting tools (ferro rod, waterproof matches, lighter, tinder)\n\u2022 First aid kit (trauma supplies, meds, antiseptics, bandages)\n\u2022 Emergency shelter (tarp, lightweight tent, mylar blanket)\n\u2022 Warm clothing & insulation (wool socks, thermals, waterproof layers, gloves)\n\u2022 Multi-tool or survival knife (fixed blade preferred)\n\u2022 Light sources (headlamp + flashlight with spare batteries or solar)\n\u2022 Navigation tools (compass, maps, GPS backup if possible)\n\u2022 Portable power source (solar charger, power bank, tri-fuel generator, solar generator)\n\u2022 Communication gear (emergency radio, whistle, backup phone, satellite phone)\n\u2022 Self-defense tools (pepper spray, firearm, where legal, or alternative)\n\u2022 Sanitation & hygiene items (soap, wipes, toilet paper, waste bags)\n\u2022 Important documents & cash (waterproof bag with ID, cash, emergency contacts)"

His career with EasyJet is doomed.\u201d\nThe incident occurred August 9 after veteran flyboy had reportedly just gotten done ferrying vacationers from the UK to Cape Verde, an idyllic island nation in West Africa.\nHe reportedly checked in at the five-star Melia Dunas Beach Resort and Spa, whereupon he proceeded to embark on a post-flight booze binge.\nHis bender eventually spiraled out of control.\nAt around 2:30am August 5, appalled guests reportedly witnessed the plastered pilot undress and wander into the reception area, before continuing on to the gym and spa in his birthday suit. He was reportedly in a \u201cparalytic\u201d state, sources said.\n\u201cThe pilot did not have a stitch on and reeked of alcohol,\u201d another anonymous airline insider told the outlet.\nTo make matters worse, the flyboy was slated to make the 2,332-nautical-mile trip back to Gatwick in London on the afternoon of August 6, the BBC reported.\nHowever, onlookers identified the boozy bozo and alerted the EasyJet brass, who took him off the plane and found a replacement.\n\u201cAs soon as we were made aware, the pilot was immediately stood down from duty, in line with our procedures,\u201d an airline rep declared. \u201cThe safety of our passengers and crew is EasyJet\u2019s highest priority.\u201d\nThey have since launched a probe into the flyboy\u2019s naked antics.\nThe aforementioned source agreed with the decision on the grounds that \u201canyone who saw the pilot cavorting naked in the early hours on the day before a flight would not dream of getting on a plane with him at the controls.\u201d\n\u201cHe was so drunk that you wouldn\u2019t have put him in charge of a toy airplane, never mind the real thing with hundreds of passengers,\u201d they said. \u201cWe all make mistakes but the level of stupidity on display here by a veteran captain beggars belief.\u201d\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first sky captain to get busted for hitting the sauce before a flight.\nEarlier this year, a Southwest Airlines pilot was arrested shortly before takeoff on Wednesday in Georgia after he allegedly showed up to work intoxicated, police say."

She\u2019s upset with me because she found out her adult daughter, \u201cPaisley,\u201d had moved without telling anyone.\nI discovered it when Paisley had some mail sent to my house and later revealed she had moved across the country. Jenny and Paisley were no-contact; they had a huge argument six months ago and haven\u2019t spoken since. I was in contact with both. Paisley explicitly told me that she didn\u2019t want to deal with her mother.\nWhen I found out Paisley had moved, I asked if she wanted me to tell her mom because Jenny had blocked her. She said no. Our mom found out because Paisley also had her mail sent to Mom\u2019s home, and Mom thought she was still in town. Mom told Jenny, and Jenny erupted on me. I thought I was doing what everyone wanted. Was I the villain in the story? \u2014 CONFOUNDED IN KENTUCKY\nDEAR CONFOUNDED: You did nothing wrong. Your sister erupted on you because you were handy. It\u2019s a shame your sister and her daughter couldn\u2019t mend fences, but the fault doesn\u2019t lie with you. Paisley moved to escape the dysfunction in the family, which may have been wise, because there appears to be plenty of it. You are not a villain, and you should not accept being labeled that way.\nDEAR ABBY: My spouse continuously scrolls through video posts on her cellphone while we are in the same room. I have asked her to please engage her earphones, but she seldom does. Now, I simply turn off the TV and wait sometimes for up to a couple of hours before she quits. I don\u2019t dare tell her that this is annoying. I have tried going into other rooms but feel trapped in my own home with her scrolling nonsense. When I have tried to talk to her, she throws all my faults in my face to shut me down on this subject. Suggestions? \u2014 HEARING TOO MUCH IN OHIO\nDEAR HEARING: Yes, I suggest that while your spouse has every right to disappear down the rabbit hole of her cellphone if she wishes, to insist on inflicting the audio on you is inconsiderate. Asking her to engage her earphones isn\u2019t rude \u2014 it\u2019s a natural response to being forced to be an unwilling audience. I have pointed out in the past that \u201cthe best defense is a strong offense.\u201d This is the tactic your spouse is employing so she won\u2019t have to cooperate.\nSome sessions with a licensed family therapist might help you to become more assertive. If you can\u2019t bring yourself to do that, then my last suggestion is this: Choose an activity that takes you away from the house and introduces you to friends with similar taste in entertainment to your own.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.
