  "title": "China Deflation to Linger, Morgan Stanley's Xing Says",
  "description": "Morgan Stanley is not changing its inflation forecast for China despite the government's efforts to rebalance its economy toward consumption, including a recent consumer loan subsidy plan. The bank's chief China economist Robin Xing speaks on \"Bloomberg: The China Show.\" (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "How big of a stimulus do you think this could be? Well, if you take a step back connecting the dots, this is a part of the journey to gradually tilt towards consumption. So you heard so much about anti-evolution, not the two months, but we know to do this anti-evolution, just based on supply coming up is not enough. You have to boost the demand. And so far, we have things, so many small steps. But the right direction, the fertility support, about 100 billion. Um, the free preschool education, a lot of \u00a530 billion and the most recent one, today's announcement of the subsidy on consumer loan. So connecting the dots, they are gradually shifting towards a consumption that's definitely positive for the macro narrative. Hmm. I can't help but think when someone mentions personal loans, right? It's almost up to the consumer what to do with that money. And, you know, I think part of what they mention here, big ticket items, autos are part of that. You could also take a personal out and put it in the stock market. Right. If you think about it, it's almost subsidizing the cost of putting your money in the stock market. What do you make of what consumer behavior is right now? What are people doing with their money in China, which to some extent has gone into the equity market? And what does that tell you about consumer behavior? Yes, there is the you mentioned the very new but very important factor. Liquidity is the driver's seat. Talking about consumers, they put so much money in the term deposit in the last two, three or four years. But right now, China, the long term rates are very low. Liquidity is quite abundant. We see some early signs, bit institutions like Life Earth as the managers or consumers, they are gradually shifting away from bond or term deposits into equity linked exposure. So this is it's still early, but it's real. However, this is more about a liquidity driven grind higher for the equity market. The Chinese Investors Investor Dictionary, they're going to water buffalo so slightly different from a conventional, fundamental driven more market. The fundamental wise reality check, if not great deflation, is here to stay and that data will be soft in the second half. We had too much front loading of exports of physical impulse in the first half. So second half we will see paybacks. That's why I think it's very important to see can they combine the supply side, the cleanup up, anti-evolution with demand stimulus and these small steps? They are small but moving in the right direction. So I think here even, David, you have had me here maybe three or four time think late last year and first the September period, 2024 to 42, to tackle the deflation correctly. Then January, February this year, the so-called the comeback of animal spirit, the jackknife bag, the deep think moment. Then they saw summer and tell you collusion. I think every round, if you are cynical, you can say these are not a game changer. These are owning baby steps on the shooting. But every round it helps the narrative on China, keeps it involving, keeps improving. So connecting the dots, I think he's definitely, definitely positive. I want to get your take on you still think, though, despite what we're hearing on anti-evolution, that your base case of persistent deflation is going to be here to stay into 2026? Why? What's what are you seeing? I mean, we're seeing prices come up in the upstream side of things. Where else? How does it all play out in terms of inflation? So lack of thereof anti-evolution mean try to put an end to destructive competition. So the aims are clear. Stocking these subsidiary things try to allocate more efficiently and try to gradually a tilt toward the consumption. But this is not 2016. In 2016 supply side, the reform achieved a big success because it was only in upstream sector. Overcapacity was only in steel coal, a few upstream state owned factories. Today's pressure sits in downstream sector private new economy sector. So it's much more complex. You can't do a mandate of cutting capacity. You have to do it in a measured market. The first move, and that means you have to be patient. And right now, the there are a lot of rhetorics, but the rather extend thing to growth, at least the several month lag. So we have to be patient. I'm not changing our pie or CPI forecast for the rest of this year, but within 12 months, if we can use the fourth Plenum in late October this year to address some of these fundamental problems, I tried to set up a unified national market, shifting the tax system towards one that rewards efficiency and income. And the change in the local government, the incentives from rewarding output to rewarding householder well-being give the youth a five year plan in the fourth plenum to address these issues. I think finally, these two pieces that fall into place, this story will upgrade the from a so called a water buffalo into fundamental driven reflation. The issue, as you point out, is markets can be impatient every now and then. You know, markets tend to move quicker than the economy in this specific case, likely going to move quicker than the inflation print comes out. So you have a fantastic diagram here. I wish I could show this to viewers here of just help us understand what the base case reflation pattern looks like, what is a durable exit from deflation here and when do we get to that point? Three things. Firstly, if the price indicator broadening firm, not just to the upstream upstream is easier, you can do consolidation among employees, but it's about the downstream API and the core services CPI. So that's number one. Number two is corporate profit and wages inching up. So people start to find a good job because firms start to hire. Last but not least, consumption as a percentage of GDP going up because of social safety net is being deepened, covering more and more migrant workers and the farmers so people feel safer to spend. That's the three signs to chart. If this is a success for China and tell you what we should. Okay, so that's the path of reflation. What's the path of tariffs? I mean, we're starting to get more of these trade deals between the U.S. and North Asia and maybe parts of the region here. We're still waiting for some sort of trade deal with China, but it seems like we're seeing lower tariffs for the rest of world. Well, versus China, is China going to end up in a weaker position in all of this? Well, I do agree with you on certainty. If it's here to stay and this extension of the U.S., the China truth, it's a path, not a peace. So if you look at the global end, the point, the tariffs, they are drifting up and the tariff on China, as you said, is higher than most other trading partners. These things in the first half of the year, you got too much front loaded export. But the key words for the second half will be paybacks. Not mentioning these tariff uncertainty will probably weigh on global CapEx. So China exports is going to flatten and that external tailwind is going to convert into headwind in the second half for economic activity. But will U.S. and China go back to that, a prohibitive embargo level of escalation back in April? That's very unlikely that you have the reliance on Chinese. The supply chain is real and the Beijing has been playing the real Earth card. So I think, yes, there could be some bumps, but a complete breakdown is unlikely. One view that's emerged this week was, you know, Chinese exports will find their way into a market. I'll use your analogy in water. Water will find its way. Right. And I wonder what your view is on the fine. There might be payback on the US front, but at some point those exports are going to find another market, for those are still cheaper because they're still cheaper and better. Yeah. Yeah. I saw a great chart from you guys on, you know, the Chinese exports to different regions and to the U.S. down to ASEAN and a lot of other regions went up showing the evidence of transshipment. Right. So it's up to corporates how they navigate to these a tariff. And the answer then is with their own resilience and diversification of the supply chain. But for Chinese jobs, for Chinese output, if you have a trans shipment, if it's still bad for the Chinese on jobs and output the right, because that basically means you have to at least allocate a bit more of your process of manufacturing in other countries to avoid a further tariff. So I think China needs to focus on domestic consumption and all of these enter evolution need to be combined with cleaning up the supply side plus demand stimulus. That's the only way to address all these global uncertainty on tariffs.",

  "summary": "Morgan Stanley's Xing says that China's economic activity is likely to continue to be deflationary until 2026. He suggests that this is part of a larger effort to gradually shift towards consumption rather than supply, as supply is not enough to boost demand. So far, there have been small steps towards this, including the fertility support, free preschool education, and a subsidy on consumer loan. Xing also noted that consumers are shifting away from bond or term deposits into equity linked exposure due to low long-term rates and the availability of liquidity. He believes that this shift in consumer behavior is positive for the macro narrative as consumers are buying large amounts of money into the equity market. Despite this, Xing predicts that great deflation, if not deflation, it is here to stay and that data will be soft in the second half due to front-loading of exports of physical impulse in the first half. He also highlighted the potential for a significant payback period due to paybacks from the second-half due to the payback of exports. The Chinese Investors Investor Dictionary suggests a more market driven approach to tackle deflation, with the focus on a measured market approach, rather than relying on rhetorics rather than on traditional measures. The government's focus is on addressing fundamental issues such as cutting capacity in complex state economies.",
