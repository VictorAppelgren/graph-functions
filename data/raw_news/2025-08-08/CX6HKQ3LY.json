      "text": "I\u2019ve been testing noise-canceling headphones for 15 years (or noise-cancelling, as it's sometimes spelled, and have put together this list of top noise-canceling models at a variety of prices. Most selections are full-size over-ear headphones, but I\u2019ve included some true wireless earbuds for those who prefer them. If you're looking for budget-friendly options, take a look at our list of the best noise-canceling headphones under $100. We also have a list of best noise-canceling true wireless earbuds and best budget earbuds for those looking for the top cheap noise-canceling buds.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nWhat are the best noise-canceling headphones overall?\nThough the recently released Sony WH-1000XM6 list for $450 -- or $50 more than the highly rated XM5 -- they're arguably the best noise-canceling headphones right now and have earned a CNET Editors' Choice award. Other high-end over-ear contenders include the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, Apple AirPods Max and Sonos Ace, while the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen), Sony WF-1000XM5 and Apple AirPods Pro 2 stand out from the pack as great options for the best noise-canceling earbuds. I've also included some budget picks, like the QCY H3 Pro and Earfun Wave Pro, for people looking for much more affordable noise-canceling headphones that deliver good bang for the buck.\nWhat We Updated: August 2025\nWe added the Skullcandy Aviator 900 ANC and removed the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds because Bose has released the upgraded QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2, which are due to hit stores in the U.S. sometime in August.\nBest noise-canceling headphones of 2025\nPros\n- Upgraded design with more comfortable fit\n- Improved noise canceling and sound quality\n- New QN3 chip is seven times as powerful as QN1 chip in XM5\n- Excellent voice-calling performance with more mics\n- Improved transparency mode\n- Spatial audio with head tracking\nCons\n- $50 more than previous model\n- No USB-C audio\n- It's not so clear how you access spatial audio\nOver the last several years, Sony has made some of the best noise-canceling headphones on the market, so it's a big deal when the company comes out with a new flagship model, like the WH-1000XM6, which arrives three years after the release of the WH-1000XM5. Though the XM5 was -- and still is -- one of the top over-ear Bluetooth headphones, there's always room for improvement. With the XM6, Sony has fixed the small design flaws of its predecessor while bumping up the overall performance. The result is a headphone that's arguably edged just ahead of the competition and is now at the top of its class. Read my WH-1000XM6 review.\nReasons to buy\nThe WH-1000XM6 are excellent for frequent travelers, remote workers and commuters who demand top-tier sound quality, noise canceling and call quality in a very comfortable headphone. If you can afford the high price, you'll appreciate what Sony has achieved here.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nIf you're budget-conscious or already own Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones, you should hold off until they go on sale. They offer some significant improvements over the XM5s, but not enough to justify rushing to upgrade at full price.\nPros\n- Eye-catching, premium design is made out of premium material and is slightly slimmer and lighter\n- Upgraded ear pads for more comfortable fit\n- Upgraded biocellulose drive units powered by discrete amplifier improves the sound quality\n- Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance with 8 microphones\n- USB-C audio for lossless wired connection\nCons\n- Premium price ($50 more expensive than PX7 S2)\n- Noise canceling isn't quite up to the level of Sony's and Bose's\n- Headphones fold flat but not up (no dual-hinge)\n- At default setting, treble may be a touch too aggressive (forward) for some folks\nWhy I like them\nBowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 technically aren't the company's flagship headphones (the PX8 are), but they're arguably better than the more expensive PX8s, offering improved sound quality and superior noise canceling in an upgraded slimmer design (300 grams) that fit my head more comfortably. The drivers aren't the same as the PX8's carbon cone drivers, but the redesigned 40mm biocellulose drive units have an improved chassis, voice coil, suspension and magnet that, according to B&W, and deliver \"lower coloration and distortion, improved resolution and superior dynamics.\" Additionally, for the first time in a B&W headphone, the drive units are powered by a dedicated, discrete headphone amplifier that provides more \"scale and energy to the sound.\" I did think their sound was more revealing and open (wider soundstage) compared to the earlier S2e's and are more exciting and fun to listen to. At the default setting, the treble may be a touch aggressive for some folks (a tad too much sizzle), which can lead to some listening fatigue. But you can play around with the 5-band equalizer in the companion app for iOS and Android to smooth things out and give the headphones a slightly warmer sound.\nWhile these are pricey headphones, at least they look like premium headphones and are made with premium materials. In my tests in the noisy streets of New York, I found that the noise canceling is significantly improved (it's better than PX8's), though it's not quite up to the level of what you get with Sony's and Bose's flagship noise canceling headphones. I also thought the voice-calling performance has been upgraded (the headphones have 8 microphones total, 4 in each ear cup).\nWhile callers said that the background noise reduction wasn't quite as good as what they heard when I was talking to them on Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, they said they could hear my voice well with minimal background noise.\nIt's also worth noting that these headphones have USB-C audio for a lossless wired connection (and they also come with a 3.5mm analog cable that stows away nicely in a compartment inside the headphone's hard case). Android users should note that they have support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless audio codecs that can help improve sound quality when listening wirelessly over Bluetooth to high-resolution tracks from music streaming services like Tidal, Amazon and Qobuz. However, very few mainstream Android smartphones support aptX Adaptive or Lossless (more support Sony's LDAC audio codec).\nReasons to buy\nThe sleekly designed, swanky Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 are excellent noise-canceling headphones that are a clear improvement over their predecessor. That said, the biggest reason to buy these over Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, which carry the same list price, is that you like their look better. They also feature USB-C audio while the XM6 doesn't.\nReason to skip/keep looking\nFrom an aesthetic standpoint, I prefer the design of the PX7 S3 to the Sony WH-1000XM6's. But I can't say the PX7 S3 is any more comfortable or sounds better (I slightly preferred the sound of the Sony, in fact). And the Sony offers slightly better noise canceling and voice-calling performance, along with some extra features such as Speak-to-Chat and Quick Attention mode. If you already own the earlier PX7 S2e, it's probably not worth shelling out full price for PX7 S3. The same is true if you own Bowers & Wilkins flagship PX8, which could get the S2 treatment in 2025. The PX7 S3 sounds more exciting than the PX8, but it's debatable whether it sounds better. I would give the slight nod to the PX8 but that's just my personal taste.\nPros\n- Design is an upgrade\n- Lightweight and very comfortable\n- Excellent sound and great noise canceling\n- Voice-calling performance is top-notch\n- Immersive Audio mode offers some sound-quality enhancements\nCons\n- Higher price than the previous model\n- No USB-C audio\n- Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life\nWhy I like them\nBose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones feature a more premium design than their predecessor, along with Bose's Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also great for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. Released in late 2023, I called these \"a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max headphones.\" Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones have edged slightly ahead of the QC Ultras, but they remain one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market. Read my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones review.\nReasons to buy\nThey're a good choice for frequent travelers, commuters and professionals who want comfortable, well-designed headphones with impressive overall performance, including excellent noise-muffling capabilities.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThose who are on a tighter budget should obviously look toward more midrange and budget headphones options. Also, Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones are arguably slightly better for around the same price. That said, since the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones came out in late 2023, they do end up going on sale fairly regularly.\nPros\n- Well-designed and comfortable headband that cups head for a good acoustic seal\n- Excellent sound and noise-canceling to reduce ambient noise by about 85%-95%\n- Strong voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio with head-tracking\n- USB-C audio for digital lossless wired connection\n- TV Audio Swap feature for Sonos users\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Not Wi-Fi headphones, despite expectations\n- TV Audio Swap feature only works with Sonos' Arc sound bar at launch (and can be glitchy)\nWhy I like them\nA lot of people expected Sonos' first headphones to be able to stream lossless audio over Wi-Fi in your home and then use Bluetooth outside your Sonos home network. However, Sonos reps told me that listening to music over Wi-Fi would greatly reduce the headphone's battery life and the company opted to leave that feature off. So even though they're equipped with a Wi-Fi chip so you can tap into a Sonos sound bar at home for private late-night viewing (Sonos refers to this as the TV Audio Swap feature), they're not really Wi-Fi headphones and are first and foremost noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones -- and I was mostly quite impressed by them. Read my Sonos Ace review.\nSleekly designed, at 312 grams, they're not as light as the 254-gram Sony WH-1000XM6s or the 253-gram Bose QuietComfort Ultras, but they're considerably lighter than the 385-gram AirPods Max and I found them quite comfortable to wear, with a relatively small gap between the headband and my head (they hugged my head nicely with just the right amount of clamping). I also appreciated tat their chrome metal yoke allows the headphones to swivel in multiple directions -- the hinge is hidden - and the ear cups adhere magnetically like they do on the AirPods Max and are replaceable, which is good.\nAll in all, the Sonos Ace headphones perform very well across the board with strong noise canceling, excellent sound quality and very good voice-calling performance. Well balanced, they're clean sounding with nice detail and sparkle in the treble along with punchy, powerful bass that doesn't get boomy. Vocals sounded natural and the headphones have a relatively wide soundstage. It's also good to see that the headphones have USB-C audio support (wired listening with a USB-C cable) and spatial audio with head-tracking.\nReasons to buy\nThe Sonos Ace are one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market, rivaling flagship models from Sony, Apple and Bose. Now that they've been out for more than a year, we're seeing some good discounts on them, which makes them a better value, and a potential alternative to Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones. While you don't have to be an owner of Sonos speakers to buy them, Sonos soundbar owners can leverage the TV Audio Swap feature for private late-night viewing (the Ace delivers virtual surround sound in this mode).\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nYou can make the argument that Sony's new WH-1000XM6 are slightly better overall for around the same price (I'm talking list price -- and yes, they're too pricey for some folks). But with the Ace selling for as low as $330, they're an easier sell.\nPros\n- Sound quite good for their relatively low price\n- Lightweight and relatively comfortable\n- Decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance for a budget headphone\n- USB-C audio (and wired mode with included cable)\n- Support for LDAC audio codec\nCons\n- ANC cuts off in wired mode\n- No carry case or pouch included\nWhy I Like Them\nQCY is another Chinese brand like Tribit, Earfun and plenty of others that make budget-priced headphones that sound better than you'd think they would for their relatively low price (the company says the Q stands for quality, C stands for creative and Y stands for youth). Its new-for-2024 H3 Pro headphones are similar to models in this price range from 1More, Tribit and Edifier, but they arguably sound a touch better and I found them relatively comfortable to wear, as they feature a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads.\nThe sound quality on these budget models tends to vary a bit from track to track. While I encountered some occasional distortion on badly recorded material and the treble just can't produce the clarity and detail that you get with more premium headphones, all in all, the sound quality was quite respectable. The noise canceling also is fairly decent -- there are a few different modes to choose from in QCY's companion app for iOS and Android, which has a low-frills-looking interface but is robust enough under the hood -- and callers said the voice-calling performance was also good, especially given the price of these headphones.\nYou do get multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to connect two devices simultaneously (you have to activate it in the app), but features like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off are missing. Also, you can set the headphones to automatically turn off after not being in use for a certain amount of time (I set it for 15 minutes), but the headphones turned off in the middle of a long call I was making, not seeming to realize that I was using the headphones. The H3 Pro are decent value for the cost, particularly when their price dips closer to $50.\nReasons to buy\nLike the handful of other budget headphones I recommend, the QCY H3 Pro are better than you'd think they'd be for their modest price in terms of both design and performance.\nReasons to skip/ keep looking\nIf you're a critical listener, these probably aren't for you as these headphones occasionally distort audio and lack the treble clarity found in higher-end models. Also, it's too bad they don't come with any sort of carrying pouch and noise cancelling isn't available when using the cable for wired listening (you'd kind of want noise canceling if you watching a movie on a plane plugged into your seat's inflight entertainment system).\nPros\n- Relatively lightweight and comfortable\n- Not only fold flat but fold up into a nicely designed crossbody travel bag\n- Very good sound after tweaking EQ settings\n- Well-designed physical controls\n- Good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance\n- THX spatial audio with head tracking\n- Strong battery life (up to 50 hours with ANC on)\nCons\n- No USB-C audio\n- Fairly pricey\n- No support for LDAC and AptX audio codecs (AAC and SBC only)\nWhy I like them\nWe reviewed Skullcandy's wired Aviator Roc Nation headphones all the way back in 2011. Now Skullcandy's brought the Aviator design back in a wireless noise-canceling model called the Aviator 900 ANC headphones. They kind of surprised me because Skullcandy is better known for its Crusher headphones, which deliver bone-rattling bass but not so-called premium-sounding headphones. However, the Aviator 900, developed in partnership with THX, deliver surprisingly impressive sound. They're not so great out of the box, but after you make some tweaks to the EQ in the app and turn on the THX spatial audio, the sound improves dramatically and is arguably more exciting than the new Nothing Headphone (1)'s sound and more fun to listen to.\nLike the Nothing Headphones (1), the Aviator 900 ANC also list for $300 and have a translucent theme. However, the Aviator 900 is lighter (289 grams) and more comfortable to wear. Plus, it not only folds flat but folds up into a well-designed crossbody travel bag (you can remove the strap) and has some nifty physical control buttons (I also liked the integrated mini LED display, though it's value is dubious because you can't see it while you have the headphones on). It, too, features good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance, though the Nothing Headphone (1) may have a slight edge in those departments. Even so, I slightly preferred Skullcandy headphones for their fit and sound, especially after a firmware upgrade fixed an early issue that some people experienced with the sound distorting at higher volumes.\nReasons to buy\nThe Aviator 900 ANC headphones offer a comfortable fit and strong overall performance in a unique, eye-catching design.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThe headphones are fairly pricey, so you may want to wait for them to go on sale. They've dipped to as low as $200 during Amazon Prime Day, and I suspect we'll see them sporadically discounted to near $200 as we head into the holiday buying season.\nPros\n- Surprisingly comfortable for their weight\n- Impressive sound and build-quality\n- Adaptive noise canceling is top-notch and so is transparency mode\n- Good headset performance for calls\n- Spatial audio virtual surround for iPhones and iPads is a sweet bonus feature\n- Automatic switching between iOS devices on your iCloud account (multipoint Bluetooth)\nCons\n- Expensive, heavy and the smart case may be too smart for its own good\n- No cable included for wired use\n- Android users lose a couple of key features\n- People around you can hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up (they leak some sound)\n- Equipped with Apple's H1 chip, not the newer H2\nWhy I like them\nIn late 2024, Apple updated the AirPods Max with USB-C charging -- instead of Lightning -- and added new color options but didn't upgrade the headphones in any other ways that we're aware of. Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max deliver impressive sound quality, excellent noise canceling, very good voice-calling performance, as well as high-end build quality (aluminum ear cups and stainless steel telescoping arms) and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature with head tracking. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. It's also worth noting that Apple enabled USB-C audio for the AirPods Max in March of 2024. Read my review of the original Lightning-enabled AirPods Max.\nWhat that means is that you can use the included USB-C charging cable to connect the headphones to your USB-C-equipped PC, phone or tablet to get lossless audio (the sound quality is slightly improved with wired listening, especially if you're listening to lossless audio files). While Apple doesn't include a USB-C-to-3.5mm cable -- yes, such a cable should be included with headphones that cost this much -- it will sell you one for $39.\nReasons to buy\nYes, they're pricey, but the AirPods Max remain top-notch noise-canceling headphones that are right there with Sony's and Bose's flagship models. Like other AirPods, they have some Apple-only only features, including spacial audio with head-tracking and automatic switching between Apple devices, that Apple users will appreciate.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile the AirPods Max were updated with USB-C connectivity, which has some advantages, they haven't been substantially upgraded since their release in 2020. I'd like to see them at least updated with Apple's more powerful H2 chip (they're equipped with the H1 chip) that delivers some additional features and is available in the AirPods Pro 2. Could we get an AirPods Max 2 in 2026? Maybe.\nWhy I like them\nSony has released its new-for-2025 WH-1000XM6 headphones, but its former flagship model, the XM5 is still an excellent headphone that's often on sale for closer to $300. Their noise-canceling, voice-calling and sound isn't quite as good as what the XM6 offers (the XM6 sounds a little more detailed with improved bass performance) and the XM6 has a dual-hinge design that allows them to fold up, not just fold flat. As a result, the XM6's case is a little smaller. Additionally, the XM6 is powered by a new QN3 chip that Sony says delivers 7 times the performance of the QN1 chip found in the XM5s. All that said, while the jump in performance from the XM5 to the XM6 is certainly noticeable, it isn't huge; the XM5 still offers very good sound, noise-canceling and voice-calling performance that should satisfy most people. Read my Sony WH-1000XM5 review.\nReasons to buy\nThe biggest reason to buy the XM5 is if you can't afford the XM6 and find the XM5 substantially discounted. It's still quite competitive with the Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, the Sonos Ace and Apple's AirPods Max.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nIt's always a little hard to buy a previous-generation headphone that was released three years ago (2022) when you know a newer, better model (the XM6) exists and will eventually go on sale.\nPros\n- Upgraded design\n- Very comfortable\n- Improved noise-canceling and sound quality\n- Robust feature set\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Smart Tx audio transmitter included\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Some people may find Smart Tx audio transmitter not that useful\nJBL's new flagship noise-canceling headphones, the Tour One M3 Smart Tx, are a nice step up from the company's earlier Tour One M3. Not only are the more comfortable (they weigh 278 grams and have an upgraded ear cup design), but they feature better noise-canceling, slightly improved sound quality and good voice-calling performance. The headphones also come with an accessory that isn't included with competing premium noise-canceling models: the JBL Smart Tx audio transmitter, which enables you to wirelessly deliver audio to the Tour One M3 from any USB-C or analog audio source such as an inflight entertainment system, PC, tablet or television. It has a touchscreen LCD that allows you to control the Tour One M3's features, including music playback, call management and EQ Settings JBL says the Smart Tx -- it's rated for up to 18 hours of battery life -- also has the ability to broadcast any audio source to an unlimited amount of Auracast-enabled devices.\nJBL's previous two Tour One models fell a little short of Sony's and Bose's premium noise canceling offerings. But its upgraded and more refined third-generation Tour One M3 headphones are more viable alternative to those models, though they would be more enticing if they were priced closer to $300. Equipped with newly designed 40mm Mica Dome drivers, the sound is well-balanced and dynamic, with well-defined bass and some sparkle in the treble. The mids, where vocals live, could sound a tad more natural and clear, you can make some tweaks to those aforementioned EQ settings to dial in a sound profile that's optimized for your hearing and specific musical tastes. In the end, the Tour One M3 are very good noise-canceling headphones, with a robust feature set, including JBL Spatial Sound with head tracking, 8 mics (4 on and in each ear cup) and support for the LDAC audio codec for Android devices. Their only issue is that their sound and noise canceling doesn't rise above the competition in this price range. So, as I said, they probably need to cost a $50-$100 less for someone to choose them over Sony, Apple or Bose.\nWhen Sony's WF-1000XM4 earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles -- they're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite. And at $300 -- $20 more than their predecessor -- they're costly too. But overall they're really impressive -- easily among the very top earbuds on the market.\nPros\n- Sturdy, eye-catching design with translucent elements\n- Clean, clear sound with well-defined bass that's enjoyable to listen to\n- Strong noise-canceling and voice-calling performance\n- Excellent controls that are intuitive to use\n- USB-C audio\n- Nice carrying case (although some find the zipper problematic)\nCons\n- Headphones are a ltitle heavy and not quite as comfortable as some competing models\n- They fold flat but don't fold up\n- Sound quality is good but not a wow\n- The ear pads are not easily removable and it's unclear whether they're replaceable\nThe Nothing Headphone (1) ended up being more impressive than I thought it would be. Nothing has always been a good marketing company that usually does a bang-up job hyping its products. Its first earbuds were a little more style over substance (the performance has improved with more recent models), but this headphone's sturdy, eye-catching design is backed by strong performance. While I have some quibbles with the headphone being a little heavy and slightly prefer the sound quality of some competing models, this is one of the best new headphones of 2025. It will be interesting to see if its price can come down a bit to make it an even more compelling premium noise-canceling headphone option. Read Nothing Headphone (1) review.\nPros\n- Lightweight design, now with USB-C charging and dust-resistance\n- Excellent sound and noise canceling with improved acoustic architecture\n- Powered by Apple's H2 chip\n- Charging case has U1 chip and built-in speaker for Find My\n- Strong voice-calling performance\n- Support for 20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio with Apple's Vision Pro headset\n- User-friendly controls on stem for audio control\nCons\n- No support for high-resolution audio with other Apple devices (except headset)\n- No XL eartips included\nApple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd gen). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro.\nNevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Good sound with very good noise canceling and ambient sound mode\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- 35 hours of battery life\n- Multipoint Bluetooth\n- Robust EQ settings\nCons\n- No carrying case\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No LDAC audio codec support\nSony's improved entry-level noise canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s. But they sound more premium than they look (and feel), and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe -- or maybe not. But the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these should see significant discounts in the not-so-distant future, which is what you may want to wait for.\nPros\n- Improved sound quality, noise canceling and ear pad design\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No Apple H2 chip\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No major design changes except for case\nLove 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as a wired headphone back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read our full review to find out what makes this a very good headphone with some caveats.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Good sound quality and ANC for the price\n- Strong battery life\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No carrying case\n- No 3.5mm jack for wired listening\nWhy I Like Them\nThe Edifier W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, W820NB Plus, and like that earlier popular budget model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android.\nThe W830NBs do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB supports the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable for a wired connection.\nReasons to buy\nThe Edifier W830NB headphones are one of the few budget noise-canceling headphones I recommend to folks who don't want to spend too much on a headphone but want something decent that doesn't look and feel too cheap, is comfortable to wear and delivers respectable sound and noise-canceling.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nYou can only expect so much from these headphones. They're better than you'd expect given their price, but more premium models that cost significantly more do offer better performance and built quality. Also, although these have USB-C audio, they're missing a 3.5mm headphone cable to plug into the headphone jack of an inflight entertainment systems. And no carrying case is included.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit for long wear\n- Good sound with punchy bass for their low price\n- Decent noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with two levels of ANC\n- Support LDAC audio codec for compatible devices\n- Included cable for wired listening\nCons\n- ANC disabled when in wired mode\n- Lacking a bit of sound clarity\nEarfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with its new-for-2024 Wave Pro headphones. They list for $80, but click the $20-off instant coupon on their product page and add the code EWPROCNET at checkout for some sweet discount. While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and they offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less.\nThey're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphone and other compatible devices. I also like that they come with a hard case and a cable connection for wired listening (though noise-canceling is disabled when you go wired, which is a bit of a bummer).\nPros\n- Well-designed and comfortable to wear\n- Good sound quality and noise-canceling performance\n- Strong feature set\n- Strong battery life\nCons\n- Voice-calling suffers in windy environments\n- Carrying pouch leaves headphones vulnerable to damage\nThe well-designed and comfortable JBL Live 770NC offers some modest improvements over its predecessor, including better battery life (up to 65 hours with ANC off and 50 hours with ANC on) and Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio (via a future firmware upgrade). Equipped with 40mm drivers, you get bold, nicely defined sound with powerful bass that's relatively tight. JBL's Ambient Aware and TalkThru features are on board along with multipoint Bluetooth pairing (the one feature that's missing is ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off). I thought the headphones' noise muffling capabilities were good and callers said they could hear me well even in noisier environments except when the wind picked up around me. The headphones fold up and a simple carrying pouch (no hard case) is included along with a cable for wired listening.\nPros\n- Excellent sound\n- Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance\n- Impressive battery life\n- Good sound personalization features\nCons\n- Ho-hum design\n- Noise-canceling isn't as good as Sony's or Bose's\nWhy I like them\nSennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors.\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, although the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, and they have the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that \"assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste.\"\nEquipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers \"best-in-class\" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.\nReasons to buy\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless costs less than flagship models from Sony, Bose and Apple and offer excellent sound and good build quality.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile I'm fan of the Momentum 4 Wireless and like their sound a lot, they're noise canceling and comfort level isn't as good as what you get from the Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony WH-1000XM5 or WH-1000XM6.\nPros\n- Very good sound quality with good clarity and well-defined bass\n- Good noise canceling and voice-calling performance\n- USB-C audio for lossless wired listening\n- Impressive features like touch controls, adaptive noise canceling, and AptX Adaptive Audio codec support\nCons\n- Headphones initially fit a little too tightly\n- Uninspired design\nWhy I Like Them\nIf you can't afford Sennheiser's flagship Momentum 4 Wireless and other premium models from Bose, Sony and Apple, the Sennheiser Accentum Plus is a good midrange alternative that doesn't quite offer the same performance as those higher-end models but offers better build quality and sound than most budget noise canceling headphones. In essence, these are a slightly stripped down version of the Momentum 4 Wireless and share a similar aesthetic and the same touch controls but feature different drivers (the Momentum Wireless 4 have larger 42mm drivers and offer richer, more detailed sound with slightly better bass performance). Still, these sound good for the money, offer respectable noise canceling and support USB-C audio wired listening and the AptX Adaptive audio codec that's compatible with some Android devices.\nReasons to buy\nThey cost about half the price of premium models in the $350-$400 range and deliver 75-80% of their performance while featuring good build quality.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThe Accentum Plus has a little more clamping force than some headphones so not everybody finds it incredibly comfortable (it helps to stretch the headband and break it in a bit so to speak). While it sound quite good for the money, its noise canceling performance isn't as good as what you get from premium models from Bose and Sony.uild quality\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Very good sound and noise canceling with new Wind Block feature\n- Good voice-calling performance with integrated cable microphone and six on-ear mics\n- USB-C audio for lossless wired listening\nCons\n- Mostly the same as previous model but costs $50 more\nWhen Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a new, slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the very comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). But the QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling and strong voice-calling performance.\nAs for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \"visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \"help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com.\nWhile the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than that in 2024 -- so look to buy them when they're on sale. You can read our review of the QuietComfort 45 to get a good take on the QuietComfort Headphones.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Improved sound quality and noise-canceling performance\n- Upgraded microphones\n- Quick attention mode returns\nCons\n- Bass can get a little boomy, especially with ULT button engaged\n- Headphones look a little big\n- No USB-C audio\nThe ULT Wear (WH-ULT900N) is the successor to Sony's popular extra bass model, the WH-XB910N, and features upgraded drivers (better sound) along with improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance. Both Sony's flagship WH-1000XM5 and entry-level CH-720N offer more balanced sound, but the ULT Wear deliver on their promise of delivering dynamic, powerful sound with deep bass. The only downside is that bass can get sometimes get a little too boomy, especially when you engage the bass boost mode with the ULT button.\nPros\n- Relatively comfortable for an on-ear headphone\n- Good sound quality\n- Decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance\n- Excellent battery life\nCons\n- No carrying case\nThe JBL Tune 670NC is one of a relatively small number of on-ear headphones to offer active noise canceling. It's something of a value model -- no carrying case is included -- but it does have memory foam ear pads that get you a comfortable fit for an on-ear headphone. Deliver clear sound with punch bass, it has 32mm drivers and improves on its predecessor's battery life, offering up to a whopping 70 hours (or 44 hours with ANC on), and an extra three hours of battery with just five minutes of charge. This model includes the latest Bluetooth 5.3 (with LE Audio) and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. It also has JBL's Ambient Aware (transparency mode) and TalkThru features. It's available in black, white and blue and comes with a cord for wired listening.\nCompare noise-canceling headphones\nCompare battery life, noise-canceling ability, water-resistance, price and other features for each pair of noise-canceling headphones on this list in our side-by-side comparison.\n| Product | Battery life | Noise canceling | Bluetooth multipoint | Headphone type | Water-resistant | Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones | Up to 24 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$$ |\n| Sony WH-1000XM5 | Up to 32 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$$ |\n| Sonos Ace | Up to 30 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$$$ |\n| QCY H3 Pro | Up to 40 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $ |\n| Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds | Up to 6 hours | Yes (ANC) | No | In-ear true wireless earbuds | Yes (IPX4 splash-proof) | $$$ |\n| Sony WF-1000XM5 | Up to 8 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | In-ear true wireless earbuds | Yes (IPX4 splash-proof) | $$$$ |\n| Apple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) | Up to 6 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes (for Apple users only) | In-ear true wireless earbuds | Yes (IP54 splash-proof and dust-resistant) | $$ |\n| Sony CH-720N | Up to 35 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $ |\n| Edifier W830NB | Up to 54 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $ |\n| Earfun Wave Pro | Up to 55 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $ |\n| JBL Live 770NC | Up to 65 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$ |\n| Beats Studio Pro | Up to 40 hours | Yes (ANC) | No | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$$ |\n| Apple AirPods Max | Up to 20 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes (for Apple users only) | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$$$ |\n| Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless | Up to 60 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$ |\n| Sennheiser Accentum Plus | Up to 50 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$ |\n| Bose QuietComfort Headphones | Up to 24 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$ |\n| Sony ULT Wear | Up to 50 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$ |\n| Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2e | Up to 30 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $$$ |\n| JBL Tune 670BNC | Up to 70 hours | Yes (ANC) | Yes | On-ear wireless headphones | No | $ |\n| 1More SonoFlow | Up to 70 hours | Yes (ANC) | No | Over-ear wireless headphones | No | $ |\nFactors to consider when choosing noise-canceling headphones\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new ANC headphones. The quality of value-priced noise canceling headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headphones for less than $100. But the premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more -- sometimes much more.\nFit (comfort)\nIt's key that the headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear over the course of a day with minimal breaks.\nDurability\nYou want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality.\nMaximize performance and features for your budget\nYou want the best-sounding headphones with the best noise-canceling, call quality, and features for whatever you're able to spend.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one.\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones and earbuds\nWe test noise-canceling headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria. These criteria include design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.\nDesign\nEvaluating design, we first assess how comfortable the headphones and earbuds fit (their ergonomics), typically testing each model for several hours across multiple days. For over-ear headphones, we check for adequate ear cup padding, headband pressure and heat buildup. With earbuds, we test all included ear tip sizes and evaluate their stability during movement or other physical activity. Build quality assessment includes stress testing hinges and folding mechanisms, examining material durability and verifying IP (dust- and water-resistance) ratings when applicable.\nSound quality\nWe evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Some of my test tracks include Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Athletes of God's Don't Wanna Be Normal, The Doors Touch Me - Take 3, Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Jvke's Golden Hour and Drake's Passionfruit. Tested sonic traits include:\n- Frequency response\n- Tonal balance\n- Soundstage width and depth\n- Detail retrieval and instrument separation\n- Bass response and control\n- Midrange clarity and vocal reproduction\n- High-frequency extension without harshness\nNoise-canceling performance\nWe evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out to the streets of New York to test the headphones in a real-world environment where test their ability in:\n- Public transit environments (buses, trains and subway platforms)\n- Busy street intersections for traffic and construction noise\n- Areas with ambient chatter and voices\nEach environment is tested several times.\nExtra features\nSome great-sounding noise-canceling headphones and earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes like EQ customization to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. Models with Bluetooth multipoint, or the ability to connect to several devices at once, are also noted within the \"additional details\" section of each product. We also take a look at the companion app for the headphones if there is one and how user friendly it is as well as battery life claims.\nVoice calling\nWhen we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones or earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voice. We assess their reaction to traffic noise and windy conditions for microphone performance. We also move between quiet and noisy environments to test their response. We collect feedback from call recipients about voice clarity and background noise reduction.\nValue\nWe determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones and earbuds against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nBowers & Wilkins PX7 S2: Bowers & Wilkins released the PX7 S2 headphones in 2022 with some significant improvements over the first-generation version.That was followed by a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e ($400), with the \"e\" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been retuned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip. You may see this model nicely discounted because Bowers & Wilkins has released the PX7 S3 ($450) in 2025 with both design and performance upgrades.\n1More SonoFlow: The design of 1More's SonoFlow headphones reminds me a little of some earlier Sony headphones and also the newer Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 4. They're a bit generic looking, but they're sleek enough, and more importantly, they're comfortable to wear. They also feature very respectable sound quality. Though it doesn't quite measure up to the sound quality of what you'll get with more premium models like the Momentum Wireless 4, it isn't that far off. The SonoFlow headphones deliver smooth sound with good clarity and relatively well-defined bass (they're just not quite as rich or dynamic sounding as those premium models I mentioned). They also have support for the LDAC audio codec.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro: The Pixel Buds Pro are Google's first earbuds to feature active noise canceling. While it's nice that they finally have a feature that a lot of true-wireless earbuds have had for a while, what ultimately sets the Pixel Buds Pro apart and makes them worth considering -- particularly for Android users -- is their distinct design and winning fit. That helps enhance their performance on both the sound quality and noise-canceling fronts. While not quite elite for voice-calling, they also performed well as a headset for making calls. Read our Google Pixel Buds Pro review.\nSoundcore by Anker Space One: Available in three color options, the Soundcore Space One are Anker's latest noise-canceling headphones and a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space Ones sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45. Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users.\nShure Aonic 50: A lot of us liked Shure's original Aonic 50 headphones, but they had pretty middling noise cancellation. Well, the 2nd-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours (they now have a quick-charge feature) and also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 a top noise-canceling headphone. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They feature excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure call them a \"studio headphone,\" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference).\nMark Levinson No. 5909: The No. 5909 are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones and, yes, they're really expensive at $999. But they're also really good. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy) and they're comfortable to wear over long periods thanks to their nicely padded (and replaceable) leather-covered earcups and headband. Read our Mark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on.\nFocal Bathys: French audio company Focal is known for its high-end speaker systems and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. And now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. These $699 cans sound fantastic and are great overall but their noise-canceling is fairly light, so don't buy them for their ANC. Learn more about the premium model in our full Focal Bathys hands-on.\nMaster & Dynamic MW09: Master & Dynamic headphones and earbuds have always featured unique, eye-catching designs that include premium materials like aluminum, sapphire glass and Kevlar. Its latest MW09 flagship earbuds look pretty similar to its earlier MW08 buds, but have some upgrades on the inside that deliver better performance, particularly when it comes to battery life and noise canceling (it's now very close to what Bose and Sony offer, though not quite at their level for ANC).\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer improved noise canceling along with very good sound and voice-calling performance, plus support for high-resolution wireless audio streaming if you're a Galaxy device owner with the right setup. That said, their biggest upgrade may be their new design and smaller size, which make them a better fit for more ears. Aside from their somewhat high price tag, their only drawback is that some of their key features only work with Samsung Galaxy devices. So if you're a Galaxy user or otherwise interested in the model, you can read more in my full Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review.\nBeats Studio Buds Plus: Alas, for those of you who bought the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market for now, I'm sorry to report that these new Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. If you're interested in making the upgrade, check out my full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nBeats Fit Pro: While the Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds and 2023 Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro include Apple's H1 chip and have most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. Read more about the model in my full Beats Fit Pro review.\nTechnics EAH-A800: There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800 -- and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback but the headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic sound with powerful bass and good detail (however, they take a day or two to break in).\nTechnics EAH-AZ80: Panasonic has done a nice job of creating an all-around top-performing set of buds that offer an improved fit with terrific sound, good noise canceling and a robust feature set."

      "text": "I've been testing all kinds of headphones for over 10 years -- from over-ear headphones to noise-canceling earbuds to workout-friendly headphones to earbuds with open designs. But this best list represents the best of the best from all of our best headphones and earbuds lists at CNET. I\u2019ve personally tested or reviewed every pick on this list. Recent standouts include the Sony WH-1000XM6 and Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nWhat are the best headphones overall?\nWith so many different great headphones, it's hard to declare one model better than all the others. That said, the new Sony WH-1000XM6 received a CNET Editors' Choice award in May of 2025 and sits at the top of this list, making it our current pick for best overall wireless noise-canceling headphone. While we have a few wired headphones on this list, if sound quality is your biggest priority and you're OK with a strictly corded headphone, check out more standout wired options our list of best wired headphones for audiophiles. Our top wired picks include the Sony MDR-M1 and the Sennheiser HD 505.\nWhat we updated: July 2025\nWe added the Nothing Headphone (1).\nBest headphones of 2025\nPros\n- Upgraded design with more comfortable fit\n- Improved noise canceling and sound quality\n- New QN3 chip is seven times as powerful as QN1 chip in XM5\n- Excellent voice-calling performance with more mics\n- Improved transparency mode\n- Spatial audio with head tracking\nCons\n- $50 more than previous model\n- No USB-C audio\n- It's not so clear how you access spatial audio\nOver the last several years, Sony has made some of the best noise-canceling headphones on the market, so it's a big deal when the company comes out with a new flagship model, like the WH-1000XM6, which arrives three years after the release of the WH-1000XM5. Though the XM5 was -- and still is -- one of the top over-ear Bluetooth headphones, there's always room for improvement. With the XM6, Sony has fixed the small design flaws of its predecessor while bumping up the overall performance. The result is a headphone that's arguably edged just ahead of the competition and is now at the top of its class. Read my WH-1000XM6 review.\nReasons to buy\nThe WH-1000XM6 are excellent for frequent travelers, remote workers and commuters who demand top-tier sound quality, noise canceling and call quality in a comfortable headphone. If you can afford the high price, you'll appreciate what Sony has achieved here.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nIf you're budget-conscious or already own Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones, you should hold off until they go on sale. They offer some significant improvements over the XM5s, but not enough to justify rushing to upgrade at full price.\nPros\n- Lightweight, comfortable design with dual-hinges that fold both up and flat\n- New Immersive Audio with head-tracking offers a wider, more spacious soundstage for excellent sound quality\n- Top-notch noise canceling\n- Excellent voice-calling performance with minimal background noise\n- Intuitive mix of physical buttons and touch controls\nCons\n- Pricey\n- No USB-C audio for wired listening\n- Immersive audio mode hurts battery life (24 to 18 hours)\n- Limited 3-band equalizer in companion app\nWhy I like them\nBose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones have a more premium design than their predecessor, along with Bose's Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also great for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. Released in late 2023, I called these \"a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max headphones.\" Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones have edged slightly ahead of the QC Ultras, but they remain one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market. Read my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones review.\nReasons to buy\nThey're a good choice for frequent travelers, commuters and professionals who want comfortable, well-designed headphones with impressive overall performance, including excellent noise-muffling capabilities.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThose who are on a tighter budget should obviously look toward more midrange and budget headphones. Also, Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones are arguably slightly better for around the same price. That said, since the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones came out in late 2023, they do go on sale fairly regularly.\nPros\n- Surprisingly comfortable for their weight (0.85 pounds) thanks to mesh canopy headband design a good weight distribution\n- Impressive sound quality with tight bass, natural mids, crisp highs and a wide soundstage\n- Excellent noise-canceling and a top-notch transparency mode that sounds very natural\n- They now offer USB-C audio for wired listening\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio virtual surround for iPhones and iPads is a nice bonus feature\n- Automatic switching between iOS devices on your iCloud account (multipoint Bluetooth)\n- Well-implemented digital crown for volume and playback control\nCons\n- Quite expensive and fairly heavy\n- Purse-like case is weird looking and doesn't offer as much protection as it should\n- No 3.5mm cable included for wired use on planes (optional cable costs $39)\n- Android users lose several key features\n- Equipped with Apple's H1 chip, not the newer H2\nWhy I like them\nIn late 2024, Apple updated the AirPods Max with USB-C charging -- instead of Lightning -- and added new color options but didn't upgrade the headphones in any other ways that we're aware of. Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max deliver impressive sound quality, excellent noise canceling, very good voice-calling performance, as well as high-end build quality (aluminum ear cups and stainless steel telescoping arms) and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature with head tracking. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. It's also worth noting that Apple enabled USB-C audio for the AirPods Max in March of 2024. Read my review of the original Lightning-enabled AirPods Max.\nWhat that means is that you can use the included USB-C charging cable to connect the headphones to your USB-C-equipped PC, phone or tablet to get lossless audio (the sound quality is slightly improved with wired listening, especially if you're listening to lossless audio files). While Apple doesn't include a USB-C-to-3.5mm cable -- yes, such a cable should be included with headphones that cost this much -- it will sell you one for $39.\nReasons to buy\nYes, they're pricey, but the AirPods Max remain top-notch noise-canceling headphones that are right there with Sony's and Bose's flagship models. Like other AirPods, they have some Apple-only only features, including spacial audio with head-tracking and automatic switching between Apple devices, that Apple users will appreciate.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile the AirPods Max were updated with USB-C connectivity, which has some advantages, they haven't been substantially upgraded since their release in 2020. I'd like to see them at least updated with Apple's more powerful H2 chip (they're equipped with the H1 chip) that delivers some additional features and is available in the AirPods Pro 2. Could we get an AirPods Max 2 in 2026? Maybe.\nPros\n- Eye-catching, premium design is made out of premium material and is slightly slimmer and lighter\n- Upgraded ear pads for more comfortable fit\n- Upgraded biocellulose drive units powered by discrete amplifier improves the sound quality\n- Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance with 8 microphones\n- USB-C audio for lossless wired connection\nCons\n- Premium price ($50 more expensive than PX7 S2)\n- Noise canceling isn't quite up to the level of Sony's and Bose's\n- Headphones fold flat but not up (no dual-hinge)\n- At default setting, treble may be a touch too aggressive (forward) for some folks\nWhy I like them\nBowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 technically aren't the company's flagship headphones (the PX8 are), but they're arguably better than the slightly more expensive PX8s, offering improved sound quality and superior noise canceling in an upgraded slimmer design (300 grams) that fit my head more comfortably. The drivers aren't the same as the PX8's carbon cone drivers, but the redesigned 40mm biocellulose drive units have an improved chassis, voice coil, suspension and magnet that, according to B&W, deliver \"lower coloration and distortion, improved resolution and superior dynamics.\" Additionally, for the first time in a B&W headphone, the drive units are powered by a dedicated, discrete headphone amplifier that provides more \"scale and energy to the sound.\" I did think their sound was more revealing and open (wider soundstage) compared to the earlier S2e's and are more exciting and fun to listen to. At the default setting, the treble may be a touch aggressive for some folks (a tad too much sizzle), which can lead to some listening fatigue. But you can play around with the 5-band equalizer in the companion app for iOS and Android to smooth things out and give the headphones a slightly warmer sound.\nWhile these are pricey headphones, at least they look like premium headphones and are made with premium materials. In my tests in the noisy streets of New York, I found that the noise canceling is significantly improved (it's better than PX8's), though it's not quite up to the level of what you get with Sony's and Bose's flagship noise canceling headphones. I also thought the voice-calling performance has been upgraded (the headphones have 8 microphones total, 4 in each ear cup).\nWhile callers said that the background noise reduction wasn't quite as good as what they heard when I was talking to them on Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, they said they could hear my voice well with minimal background noise.\nIt's also worth noting that these headphones have USB-C audio for a lossless wired connection (and they also come with a 3.5mm analog cable that stows away nicely in a compartment inside the headphone's hard case). Android users should note that they have support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless audio codecs that can help improve sound quality when listening wirelessly over Bluetooth to high-resolution tracks from music streaming services like Tidal, Amazon and Qobuz. However, very few mainstream Android smartphones support aptX Adaptive or Lossless (more support Sony's LDAC audio codec).\nReasons to buy\nThe sleekly designed, swanky Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 are excellent noise-canceling headphones that are a clear improvement over their predecessor. That said, the biggest reason to buy these over Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, which carry the same list price, is that you like their look better. They also feature USB-C audio while the XM6 doesn't.\nReason to skip/keep looking\nFrom an aesthetic standpoint, I prefer the design of the PX7 S3 to the Sony WH-1000XM6's. But I can't say the PX7 S3 is more comfortable or sounds better (I slightly preferred the sound of the Sony, in fact). And the Sony offers slightly better noise canceling and voice-calling performance, along with some extra features such as Speak-to-Chat and Quick Attention mode. If you already own the earlier PX7 S2e, it's probably not worth shelling out full price for PX7 S3. The same is true if you own Bowers & Wilkins flagship PX8, which could get the S2 treatment in 2025. The PX7 S3 sounds more exciting than the PX8, but it's debatable whether it sounds better. I would give the slight nod to the PX8 but that's just my personal taste.\nPros\n- Sleek, sturdy design and comfortable fit\n- Excellent sound quality with rich, well-balanced audio\n- Very good noise canceling and strong voice-calling performance with effective background noise reduction\n- Spatial audio with head-tracking for both iOS and Android\n- USB-C audio for digital lossless wired connection\n- TV Audio Swap feature for Sonos users\nCons\n- Premium price point\n- Not true Wi-Fi headphones despite having Wi-Fi chip\n- TV Audio Swap feature only works with Sonos' Arc sound bar at launch (and can be glitchy)\nWhy I like them\nA lot of people expected Sonos' first headphones to be able to stream lossless audio over Wi-Fi in your home and then use Bluetooth outside your Sonos home network. However, Sonos reps told me that listening to music over Wi-Fi would greatly reduce the headphone's battery life and the company opted to leave that feature off. So even though they're equipped with a Wi-Fi chip so you can tap into a Sonos sound bar at home for private late-night viewing (Sonos refers to this as the TV Audio Swap feature), they're not really Wi-Fi headphones and are first and foremost noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones -- and I was mostly impressed by them. Read my Sonos Ace review.\nSleekly designed, at 312 grams, they're not as light as the 254-gram Sony WH-1000XM6s or the 253-gram Bose QuietComfort Ultras, but they're considerably lighter than the 385-gram AirPods Max and I found them quite comfortable to wear, with a relatively small gap between the headband and my head (they hugged my head nicely with just the right amount of clamping). I also appreciated that their chrome metal yoke allows the headphones to swivel in multiple directions -- the hinge is hidden -- and the ear cups adhere magnetically like they do on the AirPods Max and are replaceable, which is good.\nAll in all, the Sonos Ace headphones perform well across the board with strong noise canceling, excellent sound quality and good voice-calling performance. Well balanced, they're clean sounding with nice detail and sparkle in the treble along with punchy, powerful bass that doesn't get boomy. Vocals sounded natural and the headphones have a relatively wide soundstage. It's also good to see that the headphones have USB-C audio support (wired listening with a USB-C cable) and spatial audio with head-tracking.\nReasons to buy\nThe Sonos Ace are one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market, rivaling flagship models from Sony, Apple and Bose. Now that they've been out for more than a year, we're seeing some good discounts on them, which makes them a better value and a potential alternative to Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones. While you don't have to be an owner of Sonos speakers to buy them, Sonos soundbar owners can leverage the TV Audio Swap feature for private late-night movie watching or video game playing (there's no audio latency). The feature was glitchy at launch, but now works well and a lot of Sonos fans think it's one of the key selling points of the headphone over competing premium models.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nYou can make the argument that Sony's new WH-1000XM6 are slightly better overall for around the same price (I'm talking list price -- and yes, they're too pricey for some folks). But with the Ace selling for as low as $330, they're an easier sell.\nPros\n- Refined sound profile with more balanced, accurate sound\n- Enhanced noise canceling does a better job muffling a wider range of frequencies\n- Light (250 grams) and comfortable to wear for long periods with breathable, synthetic-leather ear pads\n- Excellent voice-calling performance with impressive noise reduction\n- Robust feature set\nCons\n- Higher price tag than the previous model\n- Somewhat bulky carrying case (single-hinge design means headphones fold flat but not up)\n- Some XM4 users may prefer the more energized bass performance of that model\n- The WH-1000XM6 offers noticeably design and perfomance improvements\nWhy I like them\nSony has released its new-for-2025 WH-1000XM6 headphones, but its former flagship model, the XM5 is still an excellent headphone that's often on sale for closer to $300. Their noise-canceling, voice-calling and sound isn't quite as good as what the XM6 offers (the XM6 sounds a little more detailed with improved bass performance) and the XM6 has a dual-hinge design that allows them to fold up, not just fold flat. As a result, the XM6's case is a little smaller. Additionally, the XM6 is powered by a new QN3 chip that Sony says delivers 7 times the performance of the QN1 chip found in the XM5s. All that said, while the jump in performance from the XM5 to the XM6 is certainly noticeable, it isn't huge; the XM5 still offers good sound, noise-canceling and voice-calling performance that should satisfy most people. Read my Sony WH-1000XM5 review.\nReasons to buy\nThe biggest reason to buy the XM5 is if you can't afford the XM6 and find the XM5 substantially discounted. It's still quite competitive with the Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, the Sonos Ace and Apple's AirPods Max.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nIt's always a little hard to buy a previous-generation headphone that was released three years ago (2022) when you know a newer, better model (the XM6) exists and will eventually go on sale.\nPros\n- Very good sound with slightly upgraded acoustic architecture\n- Apple's H2 chip brings features like Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness\n- Charging case has U1 chip, built-in speaker for Find My, wireless charging\n- Top-notch voice-calling performance and top-tier noise cancellation with natural-sounding transparency mode\n- User-friendly playback controls on stems\nCons\n- Supports high-resolution audio (20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio) with Apple Vision Pro headset but not other Apple devices\n- Still no XL ear tips\n- Battery life is shorter than competitors\n- Limited feature set for Android users\nWhy I like them\nI still find AirPods Pro 2 hard to beat, especially for Apple users, who get seamless audio switching with all their Apple devices that are on their iCloud account. They're lightweight and comfortable to wear, have strong performance across the board, including good sound and top-tier noise-canceling along with top-notch voice-calling performance and spatial audio with head tracking. Powered by Apple's H2 chip, they also have a robust feature set (Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness and Hearing Aid features) and are powered by Apple's H2 chip. The charging case, equipped with Apple's U1 chip and a built-in speaker, has the most advanced version of Apple's FindMy feature with precision finding.\nIn 2023, Apple made some updates to the the AirPods Pro 2, shifting from Lightning to USB-C charging and offering some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the company's pricey Vision Pro headset. But the buds are otherwise identical to their Lightning predecessor.\nReasons to buy\nThe AirPods Pro 2's are compact, well-designed earbuds that are comfortable to wear, fit a wide range of ears and offer strong performance across the board, plus a robust feature set that now includes Apple's Hearing Aid feature. They remain a safe bet for Apple users.\nReasons you should skip/keep looking\nIf you use an Android phone, you should probably look elsewhere because you don't get access to the full suite of features that make these earbuds special. As for Apple users, unless you need new buds right now, rumor has it that the AirPods Pro 3 are expected to be released later this year -- likely alongside the iPhone 17 this fall. So you may want to wait to see what they offer.\nPros\n- Sturdy, eye-catching design with translucent elements\n- Clean, clear sound with well-defined bass that's enjoyable to listen to\n- Strong noise-canceling and voice-calling performance\n- Excellent controls that are intuitive to use\n- USB-C audio\n- Nice carrying case (although some find the zipper problematic)\nCons\n- Headphones are a ltitle heavy and not quite as comfortable as some competing models\n- They fold flat but don't fold up\n- Sound quality is good but not a wow\n- The ear pads are not easily removable and it's unclear whether they're replaceable\nThe Nothing Headphone (1) ended up being more impressive than I thought it would be. Nothing has always been a good marketing company that usually does a bang-up job hyping its products. Its first earbuds were a little more style over substance (the performance has improved with more recent models), but this headphone's sturdy, eye-catching design is backed by strong performance. While I have some quibbles with the headphone being a little heavy, and I slightly prefer the sound quality of some competing models, this is one of the best new headphones of 2025. It will be interesting to see if its price can come down a bit to make it an even more compelling premium noise-canceling headphone option. Read Nothing Headphone (1) review.\nReasons to buy\nIf you can't afford the AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM6 and want a pair of unique-looking, sturdy headphones that also offer strong performance, the Nothing Headphone (1) is an intriguing alternative.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThe design isn't for everyone and they fall a little short compared with top premium models like the Sony WH-1000XM6.\nPros\n- Rich sound with well-defined bass\n- Excellent noise canceling performance\n- Top-level voice-calling capabilities with bone conduction sensors for clear calls\n- Robust feature set\n- New gesture controls including head nodding to answer/end calls\n- Spatial audio with head-tracking for Android users\nCons\n- Premium price tag\n- No Find My feature integrated into app\n- Included ear tips might not work for all ear shapes\n- Some features limited to Android users\nWhy I like them\nWhen Sony set out to design its WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds, it was looking to address some gripes folks had with their predecessor, the WF-1000XM4 earbuds that came out in 2021. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound quality and voice calling performance. Overall they're impressive -- easily among the top earbuds on the market. Equipped with 8.2mm speaker driver units and two new proprietary Sony chipsets (V2 Integrated and QN2e Noise-Canceling processors), the earbuds deliver rich sound with nice detail, clear mids and punchy, well-defined bass. Read my full WF-1000XM5 review.\nReasons to buy\nI try a lot of new earbuds but I keep coming back the the WF-1000XM5s because they're just all-around very good earbuds, with strong overall performance and a solid feature set, including LDAC audio codec support for Android users and Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature that automatically lowers the volume of your music and puts the earbuds into ambient sound mode so you can easily have a conversation without removing your buds. Also, now that the buds have been out for around two years, they're often on sale and you can also find well-priced refurbished units.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile these earbuds are more compact and should be a good fit for more people's ears, they still might not fit some ears. Not everybody will get a tight seal from the included foam ear tips, even though they're available in four size options. Also, note that next-gen Sony WF-1000XM6 earbuds should be coming in 2026.\nPros\n- Fit Kit ear tips and stabilizer system gets you a secure, comfortable fit\n- Best-in-class noise canceling and natural-sounding transparency mode\n- Dynamic sound with swell-defined bass\n- Immersive Audio with \"still\" and \"motion\" spatial audio modes widens soundstage\n- Slightly improved voice-calling\nCons\n- Buds are a bit bulky\n- No wireless charging or multipoint Bluetooth\n- Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life (6 hours to 4 hours)\nWhy I like them\nWhile Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are a little bigger than many true-wireless earbuds, they've always fit my ears comfortably and securely thanks to their \"interlocking fit\" system with Fit Kit eartips and stabilizers (the Ultras feature a new notch to keep the stabilizers in place). Not only do the Ultras have great sound, but they deliver exceptional noise canceling -- possibly the best available -- and a natural-sounding transparency mode. I also liked Bose's new Immersive Audio spatial audio technology with head-tracking, which helps open up the soundstage and improves the sound a bit (it does use extra battery life). These buds also have good voice-calling performance, though it's not quite as good as what you get with the AirPods Pro 2. Multipoint Bluetooth pairing was added in July 2024. Read my QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review.\nReasons to buy\nIf you're looking for earbuds with best-in-class noise canceling and very good sound quality, the QC Ultra Earbuds fit the bill. They should also fit most ears well, and Bose tends to have good customer support should you have any issues. Just look for them at a discount because they've been on the market since September 2023.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThese buds are pricey, and there are premium buds to consider in this price range (or cost less if you're on a tighter budget). Also the the QC Ultra earbuds are bulkier than options like AirPods Pro 2, which may be an issue for those who prefer a more compact earbuds design.\nPros\n- Improved design: buds are 20% lighter, case is 33% smaller, and ear hook is slimmer, incorporating nickel-titanium alloy\n- Equipped with Apple's more powerful H2 chip\n- Improved noise canceling and natural-sounding transparency mode\n- Very good sound quality\n- Excellent voice-calling performance with new microphones and voice accelerometers to help pinpoint your voice\n- Built-in heart-rate sensors\n- Physical control buttons work well during athletic activities\n- Improved design and sound quality with smaller case\n- Strong battery life and wireless charging\nCons\n- Premium price point (they list for same price as AirPods Pro 2)\n- Some users may not get a tight seal with included ear tips\n- A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2 (no Precision Finding, Conversation Awareness or Adaptive Audio)\n- Some Apple-exclusive features unavailable to Android users\n- Built-in heart-rate monitor may not seem like a needed feature to some people\nWhy I like them\nThe original Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they have a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. And that noise canceling is quite good, as is the sound quality and voice-calling performance -- so long as you get a tight seal from one of the five different included ear tips. Read my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThese new Powerbeats Pro 2 fit my ears better thanks to Beats improving the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.\nReasons to buy\nFitness enthusiasts like earbuds with ear hooks so their buds won't fall out of their ears during intense workouts. Typically, such earbuds don't offer the greatest performance, but the Powerbeats Pro 2 have many of the same qualities and features as the AirPods Pro 2 with very good sound along with strong noise canceling and voice-calling performance. In short, they're versatile, also performing well as everyday earbuds. It's also worth noting that while the Powerbeats Pro 2 have some Apple-exclusive features, Beats does have an app for Android users that makes these more Android-friendly than AirPods.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile Beats has improved the Powerbeats Pro 2's design and ergonomics, they still may not be a comfortable fit for everybody's ears and some people may not get a truly tight seal from any of Beats' ear tips (I had an issue and had to use another set of ear tips from my collection). If you don't get a tight seal, you'll likely be unimpressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling and may want to return them to the store you bought them from (try to find some alternative ear tips before you do that).\nPros\n- Top-notch sound quality sound with upgraded Magnetic Fluid drivers\n- More compact design should offer more secure, comfortable fit for more ears\n- Slightly improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance\n- Triple multipoint Bluetooth pairing\n- Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head tracking\n- Five ear tip sizes with new medium-large option\nCons\n- Premium price point\n- Battery life drops significantly (by 30%) when using the LDAC audio codec, spatial audio and noise cancellation features\n- Buds still stick out of your ears a little more than some buds\n- Voice-calling performance could be slightly better\nWhy I like them\nPanasonic's new flagship earbuds, the Technics EAH-AZ100, have a more compact design than its earlier EAH-AZ80 buds (the AZ100s are 10% smaller and 16% lighter) along with improved sound quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. One of the key upgrades here is Panasonic's newly developed proprietary Magnetic Fluid Driver that Panasonic says creates \"clean, high-resolution, low-vibration and low-distortion sounds for the most authentic, balanced audio that's true to the original source.\" This type of driver is found in Technics high-end EAH-TZ700 wired in-ear monitors ($1,200), and it's been miniaturized for use in the AZ100s.\nI thought the AZ80s sounded good, and these new AZ100s sound even better, with clean, accurate sound that brings out details in your music you don't hear with lesser earbuds (Android users get support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec). As for extra features, there's Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head tracking, plus you can pair with up to three devices simultaneously (most multipoint Bluetooth-enabled earbuds allow you to pair to two devices).\nReasons to buy\nThe Technics EAH-AZ100 are among the best-sounding earbuds, so if sound quality is a priority, they should be on your short list. Also, the fact that their noise-canceling and voice-calling performance has improved is icing on the cake,\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile earbuds like the AirPods Pro 2 don't sound as good as these earbuds, they do offer superior noise canceling and voice-calling performance for less money along with an even more robust feature set, particularly for iPhone users.\nPros\n- Significantly improved sound quality with better clarity, definition and tighter bass\n- Durable, seamless faux-leather earpads for excellent comfort and acoustic seal\n- Improved noise canceling and more natural sounding transparency mode\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users\n- USB-C audio for lossless wired listening\nCons\n- Uses custom Beats chip rather than Apple's H2 chip (limits future feature upgrades)\n- No ear-detection sensors to automatically pause/resume audio\n- USB-C listening mode disables noise cancellation and transparency features\nWhy I like them\nLove 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as a wired headphone back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read my full review to find out what makes this a good headphone with some small caveats.\nReason to buy\nWhile the Studio Pros are overpriced at their list price of $350, they frequently go on sale, sometimes for less than $200. They're a solid value at that price point, offering dynamic sound along with strong noise-canceling and voice-calling performance. While they're missing Apple's H2 chip and some of the extra features found in the latest AirPods models, they do have spatial audio with head-tracking and hands-free Siri for Apple users. And the Beats app for Android users allows for decent compatibility, though you don't get all the features that Apple users get.\nReason to skip/keep looking\nThe one big miss here is the lack of ear-detection sensors -- most $350 over-ear headphones have this feature, meaning your music doesn't automatically pause when you take the headphones off. I also think it was a mistake for Beats not to power these with Apple's H2 chip, as you won't get feature upgrades designed for that chip. And Android users don't get spatial audio with head tracking or hands-free Siri.\nPros\n- Smaller design should provide a better fit for a wider range of ears\n- Built-in stabilizer fins for a more secure fit\n- Excellent sound quality with improved detail, depth and definition\n- New Tensor A1 chip steps up the processing power\n- Improved noise canceling that muffles more sound across a wider range of frequencies\n- Good voice-calling performance (Pixel users get Google's \"Clear Calling\" technology)\n- \"Hands-free, eyes-free\" Gemini AI Google Assistant for Android users\n- Spatial audio with head tracking\nCons\n- Higher price than previous model\n- Not everybody will get a tight seal from included ear tips\n- No support for AptX or LDAC audio codecs\nWhy I like them\nWhen they're in your ears, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 look a lot like the original Pixel Buds Pro and retain the stabilizer fins that help lock the buds in your ears. But they're smaller than their predecessor and Google equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and boosts their performance across the board. How you ultimately feel about them will largely depend on how well they fit your ears. That's the case for most noise-canceling earbuds, but with the Pixel Buds Pro 2, if you don't get a tight seal from the included ear tips, there's a massive dip in both sound quality and noise-canceling performance. If you do get a tight seal, these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users. Read my Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nReasons to buy\nFor Pixel device owners, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have some extra appeal because they're designed to work more seamlessly with your Pixel devices (there's automatic switching between Pixel smartphones, tablets and watches) and also feature \"Clear Calling\" for Pixel smartphones, which improves voice calling performance a bit. That said, Android owners can take advantage of most of the Pixel Buds Pro 2's features, including hands-free Google Assistant and \"Conversation Detect\" feature that pauses what you're listening to and puts the buds in transparency mode when you start talking to someone.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nI'll start by pointing out that while buds work just fine with iPhones, iPhone users miss out on several features, so Apple users should probably look elsewhere. From an ergonomic standpoint, the buds' smaller design should provide a better fit for a wider range of ears, but some people may find that the original Pixel Buds Pro fit their ears better. Also, some Android owners may be disappointed that the buds support neither Qualcomm's aptX or Sony's LDAC audio codecs (AAC and SBC are supported). Lastly, it's a little annoying that the white case can pick up stains from objects in pockets, though the case is easy enough to clean off with an alcohol wipe.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable to wear\n- High-quality ambient sound mode that sounds natural\n- Impressive feature set, including Voice Detect and built-on voice controls (no wake word required)\n- Dual driver design (10mm dynamic driver plus Planar tweeter) for excellent sound quality with superior treble clarity and bass definition\n- Top-notch voice-calling performance with very good noise reduction\n- Lights in buds are kind of cool\nCons\n- A little pricey\n- Some people may not be get a tight seal from the included ear tips, which have proprietary design\n- Design looks a tad generic and touch controls are a bit finicky\n- Noise canceling could be slightly better\nWhy I like them\nThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro stand out with their excellent fit, impressive sound quality and top-notch voice-calling performance. Though Samsung has added stems (it calls them \"blades\" and they have integrated LEDs) to these flagship earbuds, this new design works better for more people -- I found the buds lightweight and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is noticeably improved from the previous Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, with superior treble clarity and bass definition, producing a cleaner, more accurate sound. The ambient mode, which lets external sound into the buds, works well, sounding natural with no audible hiss. And I liked that the buds have their own built-in voice commands (they do not require a wake word like Google Assistant or Siri), an underrated feature. Read my Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nReasons to buy\nSamsung had some kinks to work out with these buds at launch (they paused shipping them for a time), but they're excellent earbuds, with improved performance across the board. The stem design is a little controversial for fans of previous Galaxy buds, but I like their design and they're essentially Samsung's version of the AirPods Pro 2 but geared towards Android users and Galaxy device owners in particular who can take advantage of a few Samsung-only features like support for its \"high-resolution\" Samsung Seamless Codec (there's a Galaxy Wear app for Android users).\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile I've used them with my iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone users should probably look elsewhere, as there's no iOS app, meaning all updates and settings are only available via the Galaxy Wear app for Android. Those seeking the absolute best noise cancellation available might be disappointed, as the ANC, while good, is slightly behind what's offered by competitors. Finally, people with larger ear canals may not be able to get a tight seal with the included ear tips (only three sizes are provided). Since the ear tips are custom-designed for these buds, finding compatible third-party options can be challenging.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Good sound with very good noise canceling and ambient sound mode\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Multipoint Bluetooth\n- 35 hours of battery life\n- Robust EQ settings\nCons\n- No carrying case or pouch included\n- Missing more advanced features like ear-detection sensors, LDAC audio codec support and Sony's Quick Attention and Speak-To-Chat\nWhy I like them\nSony's improved entry-level noise-canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight (only 192 grams) and comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised, as these headphones offer good overall tonal balance with punchy bass, decent clarity and a wide soundstage (the headphones are suitable for a variety of music genres. They also offer decent noise canceling and good voice-calling performance.\nNo, they don't sound as good or perform as well as Sony's WH-1000XM5 or new WH-1000XM6 headphones. But they sound more premium than they look -- and feel -- and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe -- or maybe not. But the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these are frequently discounted to closer to $100, which makes them a good value.\nReasons to buy\nBudget-conscious buyers seeking Sony quality at an accessible price will find that these offer a significant step up from truly entry-level headphone options.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThe main reason not to get these is that you simply want a more premium noise-canceling headphone that not only offers better build quality but better overall performance along with more advanced features like ear-detection sensors, LDAC audio codec support and Sony's Quick Attention and Speak-to-Chat features. Sony also leaves out any sort of carrying case or pouch with these headphones, which is slightly disappointing.\nPros\n- Excellent sound with punchy bass, wide soundstage and clear treble with equipped 42mm drivers\n- Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance with two beam-forming microphones on each ear cup\n- Good sound personalization features in user-friendly companion app\n- Comfortable design with plush memory foam earbads that fold flat for better portability\nCons\n- Ho-hum design that only folds flat, not up\n- Noise cancellation may not quite match Sony and Bose competitors\n- Heavier (293 grams) than competitors despite less premium feel\n- Early connectivity issues with some iPhone models\nWhy I like them\nSennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a distinct look that was part retro, part modern and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of the company's competitors.\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, although the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, and they have the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that \"assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste.\"\nEquipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers \"best-in-class\" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.\nReasons to buy\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless costs less than flagship models from Sony, Bose and Apple and offer excellent sound and good build quality.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile I'm fan of the Momentum 4 Wireless and like their sound a lot, they're noise canceling and comfort level isn't as good as what you get from the Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony WH-1000XM5 or WH-1000XM6.\nPros\n- Exceptionally comfortable design that maintains the classic QuietComfort fit\n- Very good sound and noise canceling with new Wind Block feature to reduce wind noise during outdoor use\n- Good voice-calling performance with integrated cable microphone and six on-ear mics for clear transmission\n- USB-C audio for lossless wired listening that now features integrated microphone for wired calls\nCons\n- Higher price than previous QC45 model, despite minimal changes\n- Lacks Immersive Audio feature and premium materials found in the Quiet Comfort Ultra model\n- Value proposition is questionable with fewer advanced features compared to similarly-priced competitors\nWhy I like them\nWhen Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in late 2023, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). But the QuietComfort Headphones still have good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling and strong voice-calling performance.\nAs for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \"visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \"help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in several new colors, including pink. Some colors may only be available at bose.com.\nReasons to buy\nIf you're a fan of Bose's earlier \"iconic\" headphones design that began with the QC35 (or maybe even the QC25), this is the Bose headphone for you. Cheaper than the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, they also regularly go on sale for $250 or less, marking them a more attractive value.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThe QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are better headphones overall, with improved all-around performance and a more premium design.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit for long wear\n- Respectable sound with punchy bass\n- Decent noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with two levels of ANC\n- Support for high-quality LDAC audio codec with compatible devices\n- Included hard carrying case and cable for wired listening\nCons\n- Bit generic looking\n- ANC disabled when in wired mode\n- They're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models\nWhy I like them\nEarfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with a few different over-ear models, including the Wave Pro (add the code EWPROCNET at checkout on Amazon to receive an additional 10% off). While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and they offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. The headphones do come with a cable for wired listening -- you can plug into an inflight entertainment system -- but the noise canceling cuts off when you're in wired mode, which is unfortunate.\nReasons to buy\nFor less than $60, you're getting decent sounding headphones with effective noise canceling that are comfortable to wear and have long battery lfie. They're also one of the few budget headphones that come with a carrying case.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nIf you're a critical listener, these probably aren't for you as these headphones lack the treble clarity and bass definition found in higher-end models.\nPros\n- Good sound quality for their relatively low price\n- Lightweight and comfortable with memory-foam ear pads\n- Decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance for a budget headphone\n- USB-C audio and wired mode with included cable for lossless listening\n- Support for LDAC audio codec and multipoint Bluetooth pairing\n- Companion app offers various customization options\nCons\n- Noise canceling cuts off in wired mode\n- No carry case or pouch included\n- Some occasional distortion\nWhy I Like Them\nQCY is another Chinese brand like Tribit, Earfun and plenty of others that make budget-priced headphones that sound better than you'd think they would for their relatively low price (the company says the Q stands for quality, C stands for creative and Y stands for youth). Its new-for-2024 H3 Pro headphones are similar to models in this price range from 1More, Tribit and Edifier, but they arguably sound a touch better and I found them relatively comfortable to wear, as they feature a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads.\nThe sound quality on these budget models tends to vary a bit from track to track. While I encountered some occasional distortion on badly recorded material and the treble just can't produce the clarity and detail that you get with more premium headphones, all in all, the sound quality was quite respectable. The noise canceling also is fairly decent -- there are a few different modes to choose from in QCY's companion app for iOS and Android, which has a low-frills-looking interface but is robust enough under the hood -- and callers said the voice-calling performance was also good, especially given the price of these headphones.\nYou do get multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to connect two devices simultaneously (you have to activate it in the app), but features like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off are missing. Also, you can set the headphones to automatically turn off after not being in use for a certain amount of time (I set it for 15 minutes), but the headphones turned off in the middle of a long call I was making, not seeming to realize that I was using the headphones. The H3 Pro headphones are decent value for the cost, particularly when their price dips closer to $50.\nReasons to buy\nLike the handful of other budget headphones I recommend, the QCY H3 Pro are better than you'd think they'd be for their modest price in terms of both design and performance.\nReasons to skip/ keep looking\nIf you're a critical listener, these probably aren't for you as these headphones occasionally distort audio and lack the treble clarity found in higher-end models. Also, it's too bad they don't come with any sort of carrying pouch and noise cancelling isn't available when using the cable for wired listening (you'd kind of want noise canceling if you're watching a movie on a plane plugged into your seat's inflight entertainment system).\nPros\n- Very good sound quality with good clarity and well-defined bass\n- Good noise canceling with adaptive technology and voice-calling performance\n- Multiple connectivity options including USB-C audio for lossless wired listening\n- Hard carrying case included for added protection\n- Impressive features like touch controls, adaptive noise canceling and AptX Adaptive Audio codec support\nCons\n- Initial tight clamping force that requires a break-in period\n- Uninspired design that lacks distinction\n- Sound quality doesn't match the flagship Momentum 4's with larger 42mm (compared to Accentum Plus' 37mm)\nWhy I Like Them\nIf you can't afford Sennheiser's flagship Momentum 4 Wireless and other premium models from Bose, Sony and Apple, the Sennheiser Accentum Plus is a good midrange alternative that doesn't quite offer the same performance as those higher-end models but offers better build quality and sound than most budget noise canceling headphones. In essence, these are a slightly stripped down version of the Momentum 4 Wireless and share a similar aesthetic and the same touch controls but feature different drivers (the Momentum Wireless 4 have larger 42mm drivers and offer richer, more detailed sound with slightly better bass performance). Still, these sound good for the money, offer respectable noise canceling and support USB-C audio wired listening and the aptX Adaptive audio codec that's compatible with some Android devices.\nReasons to buy\nIt costs about half the price of premium models in the $350 to $400 range and delivers 75 to 80% of their performance.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThe Accentum Plus has a little more clamping force than some headphones so not everybody finds it incredibly comfortable (it helps to stretch the headband and break it in a bit so to speak). While it sounds quite good for the money, its noise canceling performance isn't as good as what you get from premium models from Bose and Sony.\nPros\n- Audiophile sound quality with excellent clarity, detail, accuracy and powerful, well-defined bass\n- Distinct design with premium build quality and LED lighting element in ear cups\n- USB-C wired listening option with high-quality DAC (digital-to-analog converter)\n- Solid voice-calling performance with good noise-reduction\nCons\n- Quite expensive\n- Noise canceling is comparatively light and behind that of Sony, Bose andApple\n- Included cables don't match the premium build of the headphones themselves\n- Can't be used in passive mode when battery is depleted\nWhy I Like Them\nFrench audio company Focal is known for its high-end speakers and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. And now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. Easily one of the best-sounding wireless headphones, the pricey Bathys don't only have wireless connectivity but also a built-in digital-to-analog converter for USB wired listening with any computer, smartphone or tablet with USB-C.\nGoing wired gives you a slight bump up in sound quality (it does help to stream high-resolution audio files for optimal sound). In wired mode, the headphones deliver up to 24-bit/192kHz resolution. But the headphones also sound quite impressive in wireless mode with excellent clarity, detail, accuracy and powerful, well-defined bass. They have a spacious soundstage (for a closed-back headphone) and allow you to hear each instrument distinctly in complicated tracks where several instruments are playing at the same time. They're what I call \"revealing\" headphones that will make bad recordings sound worse and good recordings sound even better.\nReasons to buy\nWireless headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM6 sound excellent. But if you're looking for wireless headphones that take it to the next level -- we're talking best of the best for sound quality from a wireless headphone -- the Bathys should be on your shortlist.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nAside from the fact that they're quite pricey, these may be a little too much headphone for some people in more ways than one. While they're more compact than Focal's wired headphones, the Bathys are still large headphones (they weigh 350 grams) and will look that way on your head. Also, while their noise-canceling is decent enough, with a low and high mode (\"silent\" and \"soft\") as well a transparency mode, it's not nearly as good as what you get with Sony and Bose flagship ANC models. (ANC has a tendency to degrade the sound, so there's always a delicate balance adding ANC when sound quality is the priority.)\nPros\n- Exceptional sound quality with excellent clarity, accuracy and tight bass\n- Distortion-free performance even at higher volume levels\n- Easy to drive at 50 ohms without requiring dedicated amplification\n- Lightweight and comfortable with cushy ear pads that provide good passive noise isolation\n- One short (1.2 meter) and one longer (2.5 meter) cable included, as well as a 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter for professional audio equipment\nCons\n- Not a foldable model, so no carrying case or pouch included\n- Ear pad depth may be too shallow for all ear sizes\n- No active noise cancellation, inline controls or microphone on included cables\n- Purely wired design with no wireless connectivity options (requires adapter for use with newer smartphones lacking headphone jacks)\nWhy I Like Them\nWe've always been fans of Sony's MDR-7506 wired studio monitor headphones, which have long been favorite headphones of recording engineers and other sound professionals. The 2024 MDR-M1 are essentially a premium version of the 7506, delivering sound that's hard to match for the price. These are the wired headphones that will make you realize what you're missing after listening to wireless headphones for so long. They have big, open sound with excellent clarity, accuracy and tight bass. Not only is their sound a noticeable step up from the 7506s, but these get high marks for their comfort level (they weigh a svelte 216 grams). No, there isn't any noise canceling, but the soft, cushy ear pads offer good passive noise isolation.\nThough they play louder with a headphone amp, they're easy to drive (50 ohms), so you can plug them directly into a computer's headphone port or a smartphone (likely with a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter). They come with 1.2m and 2.5m straight detachable cables and a 3.5mm to 6.3mm screw-in plug adapter, but no carrying pouch or case is included. The only downside I see is that the ear pads aren't all that deep, so it's possible those with large ears that stick out a bit might have some issue with the M1's fit -- your ears might press up against the drivers, which are notable for serving up distortion-free audio, even at higher volume levels. That said, they look and feel like an upgraded version of the 7506, so if those worked for you, these should too.\nReasons to buy\nYou can get more expensive audiophile wired headphones, but the MDR-M1 deliver very good bang for your buck thanks to their relatively affordable price point. They both sound great are a comfortable to wear.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThose seeking the convenience of wireless connectivity should obviously look elsewhere, as these are purely wired headphones. Also, while these are clearly an upgrade over the MDR-7506, some people may find that the price bump from that model doesn't quite meet the bump in performance the MDR-M1 offers. In other words, you may be just fine with the MDR-7506, which costs less than half the price.\nPros\n- Good sound quality with decent clarity, well-defined bass and fairly wide soundstage\n- Affordable (less than $80)\n- Lightweight (265 grams) with comfortable memory foam ear pads\n- USB-C audio capability for lossless wired listening\n- Bluetooth 5.4 and support for LDAC, SBC and AAC audio codecs\n- Customizable sound profiles through companion app\n- Improved noise cancellation compared to previous model\nCons\n- No carrying case\n- No 3.5mm jack for wired listening\n- Sound quality lacks the the refinement and depth of higher-end models\nWhy I Like Them\nThe Edifier W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, W820NB Plus, and like that earlier popular budget model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android.\nThe W830NBs do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB supports the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable for a wired connection.\nReasons to buy\nThe Edifier W830NB headphones are one of the few budget noise-canceling headphones I recommend to folks who don't want to spend too much on a headphone but want something decent that doesn't look and feel too cheap, is comfortable to wear and delivers respectable sound and noise-canceling.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nYou can only expect so much from these headphones. They're better than you'd expect given their price, but more premium models that cost significantly more do offer better performance and built quality. Also, although these have USB-C audio, they're missing a 3.5mm headphone cable to plug into the headphone jack of an inflight entertainment systems. And no carrying case is included.\nPros\n- Superb sound quality from unique dual-driver design (40mm dynamic plus 14.5mm planar-magnetic)\n- Rich, open sound (for closed back headphones) with tight bass and excellent treble detail\n- Comfortable fit with premium Alcantara material on the headband and replaceable protein leather ear pads\n- Detachable boom microphone included for voice-calling and gaming\n- USB-C audio for lossless wired listening\nCons\n- Quite pricey\n- Noise-canceling isn't top-notch and falls short of leading brands\n- Missing some extra bells and whistles like wear sensors for auto-pause functionality\n- Uses Qualcomm's mid-tier QC3084 chip rather than flagship 5-series processor\nWhy I Like Them\nNoble is an audiophile brand known more for its in-ear monitor headphones, but it's released a wireless noise-canceling headphone called the Fokus Apollo that sounds terrific and features a special dual-driver design that combines a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar-magnetic driver. The result is rich, open sound, with tight bass and excellent treble detail and clarity, especially for a wireless headphone (it sounds a tad better in wired mode but it's not a huge difference). It's more dynamic than many monitor headphones that have a flatter, more neutral sound profile, but it still leans toward being an accurate, well-balanced headphone.\nThe design of the headphones is slightly generic looking, but they have some premium accents (Alcantara material on the headband and protein leather ear pads that are replaceable), and they fit my head comfortably. A decent, albeit somewhat large carrying case is included along with a cable for wired listening (USB-C audio is supported). And in case you want to use the headphones for videoconference calls at home or do a little multiplayer gaming, a detachable boom microphone ships with the headphones.\nEquipped with a Qualcomm QC3084 chip (Bluetooth 5.3) and an ADI chip, the Fokus Apollo 'phones support a wide variety of audio codecs, including LDAC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC. Interestingly, that's not Qualcomm's higher-end 5-series chip, but I had no issues with wireless performance, and voice-calling performance was good with decent noise reduction. Battery life is another plus. It's rated for up 60 hours with ANC on at moderate volume levels.\nReasons to buy\nA lot of people ask me what the best-sounding wireless noise-canceling headphones are for audiophiles, and I put the Fokus Apollo and Focal Bathys at the top of my list.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nAs with a lot of audiophile active noise-canceling headphones, the noise canceling is decent but not up to the level of what Bose, Sony and Apple ANC headphones offer. ANC impacts sound quality, so it's not surprising it's a little lighter with this headphone (there's also a transparency mode and a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak settings). It's also worth noting that you don't get extra bells and whistles like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off -- you're really buying this headphone for its sound quality and those dual drivers.\nCompare headphones\nNeed to compare specs?

A quick tip -- consider the price-to-performance ratio rather than just the lowest price. Entry level models ($30-$80) typically offer decent sound but fewer premium features. Mid-range options ($80-$150) balance sound quality with features like basic ANC, a better build and water- and dust- resistance (IP ratings) for portable models. Premium headphones ($150-$300+) deliver superior sound engineering, advanced noise cancellation, extended battery life for wireless models and other specialized features like planar magnetic drivers or high-resolution audio support. Determine which features matter most for your specific use cases -- commuting, exercise, professional calls, audiophile listening or gaming -- and invest accordingly rather than paying for features you may not use.\nNoise cancellation\nActive noise cancellation technology uses microphones and special processors to generate anti-noise that neutralizes any ambient sound. Adaptive ANC automatically adjusts to your environment, while adjustable systems let you control noise cancellation levels manually. Some premium models offer specialized noise cancellation for different environments (airplanes, traffic noise, ambient chatter). Over-ear headphones typically provide the best ANC performance due to larger drivers and sealed ear cups, while on-ear models offer less isolation than their on- and in-ear counterparts. If you know you'll be listening in busier environments, look for headphones with ANC. Do keep in mind that active noise cancellation can limit both battery life and sound quality, so if you're hoping to salvage those, look for headphones that advertise a natural-sounding transparency mode that allows ambient sound in without digital artifacts.\nBattery life\nIf you\u2019re eyeing some wireless headphones and expect to be using them for long stretches of time, be sure to consider the battery life. True wireless earbuds typically offer 5-12 hours on a single change, while over-ear wireless headphones can provide 20-60+ hours. Both models\u2019 battery life depends largely on feature usage, with ANC reducing battery life by about 20-30%. If you're crunched for time, look for fast-charging capabilities that offer at least 1 hour of playback from 5-10 minutes of charging. Also consider battery degradation -- like any battery-powered device, expect maximum battery capacity to drop up to 80% from its original specifications after several charge cycles. Make sure the typical length of your listening sessions is in line with the battery life of the model you choose.\nGeneral features\nToday's headphones are often jam-packed with features that can make a huge difference in your listening habits. If you want the best sound possible, advanced codec support impacts audio quality substantially. Look for AAC compatibility for Apple devices, or aptX Adaptive or LDAC for Android. Many headphones offer on-model controls for those looking for easy ways to switch songs, adjust volume or answer calls. Control interfaces vary from touch-sensitive panels to physical buttons, rotary dials and voice commands. Microphone arrays with beamforming technology and AI noise suppression dramatically improve call quality, with over-ear models often featuring detachable boom mics for gaming. Companion apps offer customizable EQ settings, firmware updates and additional features like spatial audio or gaming modes to keep your headphones\u2019 features in one spot. Consider how you plan to use your headphones and choose the features best suited to your needs.\nDurability\nYou want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that I note have sturdy build quality. Construction materials can impact longevity -- premium models use reinforced plastics, aluminum or even carbon fiber components to keep them safe from scratches and dents. For portable models, consider foldable designs with reinforced hinges and quality carrying cases. Water resistance is especially relevant for earbuds and sports-oriented headphones, with ratings from IPX4 (splash-resistant) to IP68 (fully dust- and waterproof). Over-ear headphones should have durable headband padding, sturdy adjustment mechanisms and hinges and replaceable ear pads for long-term comfort. If you\u2019re looking for a pair with wired connectivity, be sure to look for detachable cables with reinforced connectors. Also consider your portability needs: frequent travel or long commutes calls for compact, folding designs, while larger, less portable models can work for home or otherwise stationary use.\nForm factor and design\nThe physical design of your headphones can have a major impact on your listening experience. Earbuds or in-ear models offer the best portability and are usually best for exercise and commuting and can provide excellent noise isolation when properly fitted. Still, their portability means they are most susceptible to loss and damage and the in-ear design may cause ear fatigue during long listening sessions. On-ear headphones sit on your ears and balance portability with sound quality \u2013 they\u2019re more comfortable than earbuds for longer sessions while remaining relatively compact, though they may not seal as well and can create pressure points on your head and ears over time. Over-ear headphones surround your ears completely, typically delivering the best sound quality and comfort. They excel at noise cancellation and often house larger drivers for superior bass response and a larger sound stage, but they\u2019re bulkier and less portable.\nConnection type can make a big difference, too. Wired headphones offer consistent, superior audio quality without battery concerns, lower latency for gaming and often better value at each price point, though they limit mobility and cables can wear over time. Wireless models provide freedom of movement and convenience, with many offering both connection options for flexibility. True wireless earbuds eliminate cables entirely, however have the shortest battery life and are easiest to misplace without a cable or headband connecting the buds together. Consider your primary use cases \u2013 portable convenience, home listening or professional use \u2013 to determine the best form factor and connectivity for your needs.\nFit and comfort\nProper fit is critical for sound quality and long-term comfort. For earbuds, look for models with different ear tip sizes (typically S/M/L) in different materials (silicone for durability, memory foam for comfort and isolation) to help achieve the proper fit. If you plan on running or otherwise heavy movement in your earbuds, look for wingtips -- sometimes called sport fins -- that lock the buds in your ears. Over-ear and on-ear headphones require different considerations: adjustable headbands, adequate padding, appropriate clamping force and ear cups that accommodate different head sizes and ear shapes. Test for comfort during extended sessions \u2013 over-ear models should distribute weight evenly without creating pressure points, while on-ear designs should balance secure fit with minimal pressure. Consider heat buildup for closed-back designs and whether you prefer velour or leather ear pad materials.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case they break or aren't a good match for you and your listening needs. Manufacturer warranties typically range from 1-2 years, with premium brands often offering better customer service and replacement options. Research how companies handle common issues like driver failure, cable problems or charging defects for wireless models. Retailer return policies supplement manufacturer warranties -- major electronics retailers typically allow 14-30 day returns, while specialized audio retailers sometimes offer more extended evaluation periods. If you're on the quest for the perfect headphones, be sure to get a longer trial period to assess their performance.\nHow we test headphones\nI follow CNET's unbiased evaluation process for all of my headphones testing. In the CNET sound lab, I compare similarly styled and priced models side-by-side based on six key criteria: design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, extra features, voice-calling and value.\nDesign\nI first assess how comfortable the headphones fit (their ergonomics), typically testing each model for several hours across multiple days. For wireless earbuds, I test all included ear tip sizes (typically S/M/L) and evaluate their stability during movement or other physical activity. For over-ear and on-ear headphones, I examine headband padding, ear cup comfort, clamping force, heat buildup and how well they accommodate different head sizes and shapes during extended listening sessions.\nBuild quality assessments include stress testing case hinges and folding mechanisms, examining material durability and verifying IPX ratings, or dust- and water-resistance through exposure to appropriate environmental conditions, though this primarily applies to earbuds and select sports-oriented over-ear models. For over-ear headphones, I also assess cable quality and detachability, headband adjustment range and retention and the durability of any active components like buttons, noise cancellation controls or touch interfaces.\nSound quality\nI evaluate sound quality and music experience by listening to a set playlist of music tracks specifically selected to evaluate different frequency ranges and acoustic characteristics:\n| Frequency Range | Test Track | Acoustic Characteristics |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sub-bass extension (20-60Hz) | Spoon's \"Knock Knock Knock\" | Features sustained low-frequency content that tests earbuds' ability to reproduce the deepest bass frequencies without distortion. The opening drum pattern and bass line provide excellent evaluation of sub-bass presence. |\n| Mid-bass articulation (60-200Hz) | Drake's \"Passionfruit\" | The prominent bass line throughout this track offers a perfect test for punch, attack, and control in the mid-bass region. The rhythmic foundation reveals how well earbuds handle bass definition and separation. |\n| Lower-midrange clarity (200-500Hz) | The Doors' \"Touch Me - Take 3\" | The foundational instruments in this track occupy the crucial lower-midrange, testing how earbuds handle the warmth and body of instruments without muddiness. Ray Manzarek's keyboard parts are especially revealing. |\n| Upper-midrange presence (500Hz-2kHz) | Taylor Swift's \"Vigilante Shit\" | Vocals predominantly live in this frequency range, and Swift's intimate vocal delivery provides an excellent reference for midrange clarity, presence, and articulation. The track also tests earbuds' ability to maintain vocal intelligibility. |\n| Lower-treble detail (2-8kHz) | Athletes of God's \"Don't Wanna Be Normal\" | Contains complex instrumental textures with significant content in the lower treble region, revealing how earbuds handle detail retrieval and instrumental separation without sibilance or harshness. |\n| Upper-treble extension (8-20kHz) | Jvke's \"Golden Hour\" | The atmospheric production and layered high-frequency content test earbuds' ability to reproduce air, space, and the highest overtones. The track reveals limitations in high-frequency extension and resolution. |\n| Dynamic range and transient response | Orbital's \"Dirty Rat\" | The electronic production features sharp transients and significant dynamic contrasts, testing earbuds' ability to handle micro-dynamics and maintain clarity during complex passages with multiple simultaneous elements. |\nThis includes testing how well earbuds seal in the ear canal versus how over-ear models create their acoustic environment, and assessing soundstage differences between open-back and closed-back designs where applicable.\nNoise-canceling performance\nI evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they muffle lower frequencies (about 65dB of broadband noise). I then head out to the busy streets of New York City to use the headphones in a real-world environment, testing their performance in:\n- Public transit environments, like buses, trains and subway platforms (85-90dB of variable noise)\n- Busy street intersections for traffic and construction noise (45-70dB of line source noise)\n- Areas with ambient chatter and voices (70-75dB of speech-dominated noise)\nEach environment is tested several times. For over-ear headphones, I also evaluate passive noise isolation provided by the ear cup seal, while for earbuds I assess how different ear tip sizes affect noise blocking performance.\nExtra features\nSome great-sounding headphones aren't loaded with features, but I do take into account what extra features are on board and test them accordingly. Modern features include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation). I test special sound modes like EQ customization, bass modes and spatial audio features, as well as the efficiency of ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off of your ears. For over-ear models, I also evaluate features like quick-charge capabilities, wired/wireless flexibility and comfort-focused elements like auto-pause when lifting an ear cup. Bluetooth connectivity is tested by subjecting the headphones to a wireless range test or repeated device-switching if Bluetooth multipoint is included. I also take a look at the companion app for the headphones (if there is one) and test its user-friendliness across both mobile and desktop platforms where available..\nVoice-calling performance\nWhen I test voice-calling performance, I make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice. I assess their reaction to traffic noise and windy conditions for microphone performance. I assess microphone performance in response to traffic noise and windy conditions, testing both built-in microphones on wireless models and detachable boom mics on gaming-focused headphones where applicable. We also move between quiet and noisy environments to test their response, then collect feedback from call recipients about voice clarity and background noise reduction.\nValue\nFinally, I determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones against all these criteria and what they\u2019re able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. Great sounding, feature-packed headphones that offer a great bang for your buck earn top marks in this category.\nOther headphones we tested\nBowers & Wilkins PX8: The swanky Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones feature 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are \"inspired\" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's iconic 700 Series loudspeaker line. They look great and feature excellent sound. However, B&W has said to expect a next-gen \"S2\" version of the PX8 to arrive later this year that will likely offer significant improvements, particularly to noise-canceling and voice-calling performance give what we've seen the with the new-for-2025 PX7 S3.\nApple AirPods 4 with ANC: The AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply special, but I still preferred the AirPods Pro 2, which are included on this list. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works, and they're perfect for people who want ANC without having ear tips jammed in their ears. Want to check them out? Learn more about the model in my full AirPods 4 review.\nJabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: Once included on this list, Jabra has discontinued the 2024 Elite 8 Active Gen 2 after announcing it decided to gradually wind down the Jabra Elite product line. Still, we liked their incredible durability (they survived several drops without a scratch) and enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio. They make for great sport earbuds if you can get your hands on them. I have a full Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 review if you're still interested in the discontinued buds.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds: The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. While great, I found they had relatively niche use cases, which kept them off this list. Learn more about the novel model in my full Bose Ultra Open Earbuds review.\nAnker Soundcore Space One: The Soundcore Space One by Anker are a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance; still, they can't compete sound-wise with many of the premium models on this list. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, so we kept them off.\nBeats Solo 4: The $200 Beats Solo 4 are a great pair of on-ear headphones with a strong battery life, USB-C audio, and improved sound and voice-calling performance. Would I pay $200 for them? No, I wouldn't. So they're off this list for now, but keep an eye out for great deals that come around events and holidays. Read more about them in my full Beats Solo 4 review and see if they're right for you."

The market is flooded with wireless headphones, with a lot of features and wear styles available. You get the over-the-head headphones, as well as in-ear wireless earbuds and neckband earphones. There's a wide range of sound quality settings and smart options, typically available across a wide range of budgets. Noise-cancelling headphones are also pretty common now, with some featuring active noise cancellation. Heavy hitters like Bose and Apple headphones come with hefty price tags. At the same time, there are brands that are making exceptional wireless headphones on a budget. In this list, we've included a combination of some of the biggest names in the market, as well as some more budget-friendly options that will give a great listening experience.\nI've tested all the models on this list and fully reviewed many of them. If you're looking for a more refined selection, check out our roundups of the best wireless earbuds, best noise-canceling headphones, best workout earbuds and headphones and best open wireless earbuds. I'll update this list as new top wireless headphones hit the market.\nBest wireless headphones of 2025\nPros\n- Design is an upgrade\n- Lightweight and very comfortable\n- Excellent sound and great noise canceling\n- Voice-calling performance is top-notch\n- Immersive Audio mode offers some sound-quality enhancements\nCons\n- Higher price than the previous model\n- No USB-C audio\n- Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life\nBose's new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones may not be a huge upgrade over the company's Noise Cancelling 700 headphones, they feature a more premium design along with Bose's new Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also superb for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. All that adds up to the best noise-canceling headphones of 2025 and a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max.\nPros\n- More refined sound and even better noise canceling\n- Slightly more comfortable\n- Best-in-class voice call quality\n- Robust feature set\nCons\n- Higher price tag than the previous model\n- Larger carrying case (headphones fold flat but not up)\nWhen you have a product that a lot of people love, change can be risky. Such is the case for Sony's WH-1000XM5, the fifth generation of the 1000X series headphones, which were first released in 2016 as the MDR-1000X Wireless and have become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation. Over the years, Sony has made some tweaks to the design but nothing as dramatic as what it's done with the WH-1000XM5. Other than the higher $400 retail price, most of those changes are good, and Sony's made some dramatic improvements with voice-calling performance as well as even better noise canceling and more refined sound.\nPros\n- Excellent sound\n- Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance\n- Impressive battery life\n- Good sound personalization features\nCons\n- Ho-hum design\n- Noise-canceling isn't as good as Sony's or Bose's\nSennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern, and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors.\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, and they have the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that \"assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste.\"\nEquipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offer \"best-in-class\" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to\nPros\n- Very good sound with slightly upgraded acoustic architecture\n- Apple's H2 chip brings features like Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness\n- Charging case has U1 chip, built-in speaker for Find My, wireless charging\n- Top-notch voice-calling performance and top-tier noise cancellation with natural-sounding transparency mode\n- User-friendly playback controls on stems\nCons\n- Supports high-resolution audio (20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio) with Apple Vision Pro headset but not other Apple devices\n- Still no XL ear tips\n- Battery life is shorter than competitors\n- Limited feature set for Android users\nApple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd gen). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro.\nNevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Good sound with very good noise canceling\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- 35 hours of battery life\nCons\n- No carrying case\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No LDAC audio codec support\nSony's improved entry-level noise-canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s. They do sound more premium than they look (and feel), and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe, but the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these have already seen significant discounts, with prices dropping to as low as $100 during flash sales.\nPros\n- Improved sound quality, noise canceling and ear pad design\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No Apple H2 chip\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No major design changes except for case\nLove 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max, but that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. Read our full review to find out what makes these good-quality headphones, albeit with some caveats.\nPros\n- Surprisingly comfortable for their weight\n- Impressive sound and build-quality\n- Adaptive noise canceling is top-notch and so is transparency mode\n- Good headset performance for calls\n- Spatial audio virtual surround for iPhones and iPads is a sweet bonus feature\n- Automatic switching between iOS devices on your iCloud account (multipoint Bluetooth)\nCons\n- Expensive, heavy and the smart case may be too smart for its own good\n- No cable included for wired use\n- Android users lose a couple of key features\n- People around you can hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up (they leak some sound)\nYes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max delivers richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony and works very well as a headset for making calls. I wouldn't recommend them for Android and Windows users, they're the best wireless headphones for iOS and Mac users who want to switch easily between their Apple devices.\nThey also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market, along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. They're heavy, but they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, although I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions.\nPros\n- Well-designed and comfortable to wear\n- Good sound quality and noise-canceling performance\n- Strong feature set\n- Strong battery life\nCons\n- Voice-calling suffers in windy environments\nWhy I like them\nThe well-designed and comfortable JBL Live 770NC offers some modest improvements over its predecessor, including better battery life (up to 65 hours with ANC off and 50 hours with ANC on) and Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio (via a future firmware upgrade). Equipped with 40mm drivers, you get bold, nicely defined sound with powerful bass that's relatively tight. JBL's Ambient Aware and TalkThru features are on board along with multipoint Bluetooth pairing (the one feature that's missing is ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off). I thought the headphones' noise muffling capabilities were good and callers said they could hear me well even in noisier environments except when the wind picked up around me. The headphones fold up and a simple carrying pouch (no hard case) is included along with a cable for wired listening.\nReasons to buy\nIf you can't afford premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose, Sony and Apple, the JBL Live 700NC are a good alternative, offering good performance for a more modest price.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThese are easier to recommend when they're on sale for less than $200 (or even less). They're a bargain in the $150-$170 range.\nPros\n- Very good sound quality with good clarity and well-defined bass\n- Good noise canceling with adaptive technology and voice-calling performance\n- Multiple connectivity options including USB-C audio for lossless wired listening\n- Hard carrying case included for added protection\n- Impressive features like touch controls, adaptive noise canceling and AptX Adaptive Audio codec support\nCons\n- Initial tight clamping force that requires a break-in period\n- Uninspired design that lacks distinction\n- Sound quality doesn't match the flagship Momentum 4's with larger 42mm (compared to Accentum Plus' 37mm)\nIn 2023, Sennheiser released a new midrange noise-canceling headphone called the Accentum that was sort of a slightly stripped-down version of its flagship Momentum Wireless 4 headphones with smaller 37mm drivers (the MW4 has 42mm drivers). The Accentum Plus, released in 2024, adds some extra features for $50 more, or $230. They include touch controls, adaptive noise canceling, support for the AptX Adaptive Audio codec, an analog port for wired listening and a hard carrying case. Even though it costs more, I do recommend this model over the Accentum because of those extras.\nWhen I first tried them, they clamped down on my head a little too snugly. But after I worked them in and stretched out the headband a bit, they fit comfortably. They're an all-around strong performer, with good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance along with excellent sound quality that offers good clarity and well-defined bass (I also appreciated that they have USB-C audio so you can connect them to a computer or USB-C enabled smartphone with a USB-C cable and listen to audio). Like the flagship MW4s, which do offer slightly better sound quality, they're a bit generic looking. Still, they're a very solid midrange headphone that are an even more appealing option when they get discounted to less than $200.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Good sound quality and ANC for the price\n- Strong battery life\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No carrying case\n- No 3.5mm jack for wired listening\nThe W830NB is the successor to Edifier's popular W820NB Plus, one of the better value noise-canceling headphones of the last few years. The W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, and the like that earlier model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory-foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android.\nThe W830NB do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB support the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing, however. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable (a USB-C to USB-A cable is included but most computers and smartphones have USB-C now).\nPros\n- Excellent sound and best-in-class noise canceling\n- Fit Kit ear tips and stabilizer system gets you a secure, comfortable fit\n- Immersive Audio creates a different listening experience\n- Slightly improved voice-calling\nCons\n- No wireless charging or multipoint Bluetooth\n- Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life\nThe QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're a little better. They should fit most ears very well, and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. A natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and their new Immersive Audio feature opens up the sound a bit.\nPros\n- Improved comfort and sound quality\n- Better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance\n- Sturdy design\n- Support for aptX Adaptive audio codec for Android users\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Slightly heavy\nBowers & Wilkins released the PX7 S2 headphones in 2022 with some significant improvements over the first-generation version. Now it's put out a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e with the \"e\" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been re-tuned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip.\nThese headphones are more comfortable than the original PX7s -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- and not only sound better but have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. The PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious with its sturdy design and delivers excellent sound. Bowers & Wilkins also sells a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more.\nPros\n- Improved sound and voice-calling performance\n- Strong battery life\n- USB-C audio\n- Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users\n- Android compatible\nCons\n- No active noise canceling\n- No ear-detection sensors\nIn a nutshell, the Beats Solo 4 on-ear headphones have pretty much the same look on the outside as the 3s, but some notable improvements on the inside bump their performance by about 25% to 30% when it comes to sound quality, battery life and voice-calling.\nWould I pay $200 for them? No, I wouldn't. But if you look at what's happened with the Studio Pro's pricing -- they're sporadically discounted to $200 or $150 off their list price and even dropped to $180 for Prime Day -- the Solo 4s won't always be $200. I'm certain we'll see them fairly soon for what the Solo 3s now cost, which is around $130. They make a lot more sense at that price, particularly if you're looking for a more compact on-ear headphone and don't need active noise canceling.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight and relatively comfortable for on-ear headphones\n- Excellent battery life\n- Good sound for their price\nCons\n- Entry-level look and feel\n- Limited feature set with no wired option\nSony released its new entry-level CH-720N noise-canceling headphones in 2023. They're quite good, but if you can't afford them (they list for around $100), the company's new budget on-ear CH-520 headphones are an intriguing option for only around $40.\nThey lack noise canceling and are pretty no-frills, but they feature good sound for their price, are lightweight and pretty comfortable for on-ear headphones, and also have excellent battery life (they're rated for up to 50 hours at moderate volume levels). Additionally, they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with two devices simultaneously (such as a smartphone and computer) and switch audio. Voice-calling performance is decent, although not up to the level of what you get with the CH-720N.\nNote that there's no wired option -- this is a wireless Bluetooth-only headphone. The CH-520 offers an overall balanced sound with decent clarity. The bass has some punch to it but doesn't pack a wallop, and you're not going to get quite as wide a soundstage as you get from Sony's more expensive over-ear headphones. These sound much better than Sony's previous entry-level on-ear headphones -- even better than I thought they would.\nPros\n- Good value\n- Comfortable fit\n- Good sound for their low price\n- Decent noise-canceling and voice-calling performance\nCons\n- ANC disabled when in wired mode\n- Lacking a bit of clarity\nEarfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with its 2024 Wave Pro headphones. They list for $80, but click the 20%-off instant coupon on their product page and add the code EWPROCNET at checkout and the price drops to $56. While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and they offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less.\nThey're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphone and other compatible devices. I also like that they come with a hard case and a cable for wired listening (though noise-canceling is disabled when you go wired, which is a bit of a bummer).\nPros\n- New smaller design\n- Improved sound, noise canceling and voice calling\n- Upgraded processors and drivers\nCons\n- Pricey\n- No Find My feature integrated into app\nWhen Sony's WF-1000XM4 earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. They're excellent, but we had some quibbles: They're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound quality and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite, and they're also costly. Overall they're really impressive; easily among the very top earbuds on the market.\nFactors to consider when buying wireless headphones\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new wireless headphones. The quality of value-priced headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headphones for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more, sometimes much more.\nNoise canceling\nThe majority of over-ear headphones feature active noise canceling. It does slightly affect sound quality, so if you're an audio purist, you may want to go with a model that doesn't have noise canceling. You can also sometimes save some money by getting non-ANC headphones, although noise canceling is becoming a fairly standard feature.\nFit\nIt's key that the headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear over a day with minimal breaks.\nDurability\nYou want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality.\nMaximize performance and features for your budget\nYou will want great headphones with the best noise canceling, sound quality and features for whatever you're able to spend.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one.\nHow we test wireless headphones\nWe test wireless headphones based on six key criteria: design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.\nDesign\nWe assess not only how comfortable the wireless headphones fit (their ergonomics) but their build quality and how well included features like touch control are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings, but only a few full-size headphones have water- and dust-resistant (IP) ratings. Models with a more durable build are highlighted as great picks for those who may need a set of headphones that can withstand a heavy workout or a long trip in your work bag. Keep in mind that higher-end headphones for audiophiles may not have the same durability rating as those made for more casual, everyday listening.\nSound quality\nWe evaluate sound quality and music experience by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the headphones to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment. Some of my test tracks include Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Athletes of God's Don't Wanna Be Normal, The Doors Touch Me - Take 3, Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Jvke's Golden Hour and Drake's Passionfruit.\nNoise-canceling performance\nIf the headphones we're testing feature active noise canceling, we evaluate ANC performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out onto city streets to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they muffle street noise and people's voices.\nExtra features\nSome great-sounding headphones and earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. We also take a look at the companion app for the headphones if there is one and how user-friendly it is.\nVoice-calling performance\nWhen we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice. The best wireless headphones for voice calling pick up your voice clearly while significantly reducing background noise. Onboard microphones, sophisticated noise-reduction algorithms and voice accelerometers that detect when you're speaking all factor into call quality. Plus, a sidetone feature allows you to hear your own voice when chatting with noise-isolating buds, helping you avoid talking too loudly. If you're looking for a broader selection of headphones that fit this bill, check out our roundup of the best earbuds for making phone calls.\nValue\nWe determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. Great sounding, feature-packed headphones that offer a great bang for your buck earn top marks in this category.\nOther wireless headphones we tested\nMark Levinson No. 5909: These are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones, and yes, they're really expensive at $999. They're also really good. They have a sturdy design without feeling hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy), and they're comfortable to wear over long periods, thanks to their nicely padded and replaceable leather-covered earcups and headbands. Read our Mark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on.\nSoundcore by Anker Space One: The Space One is a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space One sounds respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measures up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.\nTechnics EAH-A800: There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800, and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback, but these headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic, great sound with powerful bass and good detail, although they take a day or two to break in.\nStatus Between 3ANC: Status earbuds aren't exactly the sleekest or most attractive earbuds you can buy, but if you don't mind their utilitarian look and giant stems, you're getting an excellent-sounding set of earbuds. The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, but they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds: The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.
