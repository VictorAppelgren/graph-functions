      "text": "Opendoor (OPEN) stock skyrockets amid reignited interest in meme stocks. Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre, who also hosts Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast, takes a closer look at meme stocks.\nCatch more Stocks in Translation, with new episodes every Tuesday and Thursday.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\nMeme stocks are back in the speculative pulse that we're seeing today looks a lot like the afterglow of 2021. It's not just price action, it's also pressure on management and on today's stocks in translation, we're going to show you the heat, define the phenomenon and then test it with open door. Now, here behind me is a heat map of today's price action in our meme stock basket that we first created in 2021 with a few updates. We've also seen many of these stocks perk up over the last few months. And there are lots of familiar names here, so let's try to spell out what makes a meme stock. And here we wanted to find the vibe without getting too dogmatic because there are lots of exceptions. But most meme stocks are consumer facing, or at least a familiar name. And when they first appear on traders' radars, they tend to be smaller companies with lower share prices. It also helps if traders are betting against them, so high short interest is another box check, maybe 15% if you're keeping score at home. And the most important criteria probably is heavy retail attention with a rip-roaring good story. Now, here we're looking at a chart of an index of highly shorted stocks from UBS. They're not all meme stocks, but it's a good proxy. And you can see that we recently hit the highest levels since early 2022. Now, we're going to want to watch how high this index climbs from here, but first, let's get philosophical for a minute. Why have meme stocks captured the attention of younger generations? Ed Elson, co-host of the Professor G Markets podcast, lays it out. His frame is very simple. The old menu feels closed, indexes are expensive, housing is unaffordable, unaffordable, and many of the most exciting companies they stay private for very long times. He says we are locked out of the upside. So what do we do? We invent our own asset classes, crypto, meme stocks, anything that offers a chance at returns that we cannot access through traditional paths. Now, let's take a chart, let's take a look of a case study, a case study here and we're going to go to open door. Now, look at the year-to-date whipsaw from pennies to mid-single digits. It was down 99% from its 2021 highs and now it's up multiple hundreds of percents off of its June lows, up nearly 40% today alone. That checks off a few of our boxes. It also helps explain why it's catching major retail attention. And now here's Anthony Pompliano with an interesting take. Pomp says, the people calling open a meme stock don't understand what's happening. Retail investors are now having a hive mind, working together to identify opportunities, take financial positions and advocate for improvements at target companies. He goes on to say, it's like decentralized hedge funds with individual capital and collective intelligence. Product ideas are surfaced to executives and change is happening. He wraps up saying, the power of the crowd cannot be underestimated. Now it's scoreboard time. Let's measure what retail has advocated for at Open Door and match it with what with what has actually happened here. Now, first, investors got the CEO switched out for an interim lead from product and tech. Check. They're also getting a renewed focus on AI, so check there too. As to the balance sheet, we'll have to watch future future earnings releases to check that box, but bottom line, the executives are engaging publicly, which is not how things used to play out in the old regime. So let's zoom out here and look at the new playbook. Investors are organizing online to surface ideas. They accumulate shares, drawing the attention of leadership, then they apply public pressure and they turn the screws. And if all goes well, not only do the execs listen, but they implement change. We saw some of this play out at GameStop and AMC, but to be fair, these two stocks have not become anything close to the poster children for turnarounds. So what's next for meme stocks, or should we say stocks that capture retail imaginations? First, we're going to need to keep tabs on that speculative fever. But you need more than momentum fuel. So does the C suite actually respond to retail pressures or do they just give lip service? Because at the end of the day, we want to know if we're all looking at a new activist force or just fuel for short for short squeezes.

      "text": "Walmart's (WMT) second quarter earnings results show that American consumers are continuing to look for value. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma joins Mind Your Money with Allie Canal to discuss the rise in value-seeking consumer behavior, highlighting recent statements from executives of consumer-facing brands this earnings cycle.\nSign up for the Mind Your Money newsletter, and for more information and tools to help you handle your finances, click here.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Mind Your Money.\nAmerica's biggest retailer, Walmart, is once again driving home the message that customers are seeking value wherever they can. In the latest quarter, the company said it gained share across income cohorts, leaning into its lower price model heading into back to school and the holiday shopping season. Lower prices and value is a key theme we've heard from companies from appliances to cleaning products. Here's Yahoo Finances, Brooke DiPalma, with more.\nUS consumers are navigating all kinds of headwinds from uncertainty around tariffs to elevated interest rates, and so, they're looking for the best deal wherever they can. We heard from quite a few companies this past quarter that consumers are seeking value with just about everything in their house, from the kitchen cabinet to the cleaning closet, all the way to even their clothes. And looking to upgrade your household? Well, chances are you sought out value for that, too. So, let's start inside the fridge. While Coca-Cola and PepsiCo signaled the need for value right out of the gate. Coca-Cola's CFO, John Murphy, told Yahoo Finance, quote, \"There's a lower income segment that is under pressure.\" He went on to say that in order to maintain their customer base, it plans to offer even more affordable options. And the same for mac and cheese and jello maker, Kraft Heinz. It saw volume decline by 3.4 percentage points in the second quarter. It also has to offset inflation of about 5 to 7% this year, so it needs to raise prices about 1%. And the company's CFO said on the call that it's being mindful about the current consumer situation, but some pricing is required. And from the pantry to the laundry closet, if you bought something like laundry detergent lately, well, chances are that you went for the cheaper alternative. At least that's what we heard from P&G CEO, Jon Moeller.\nWe are seeing modest trade down within our branded portfolio. Uh so within uh the different Tide offerings, there are some that are are more premium than others, and we are seeing some trade down there. We're also seeing some trade down to brands uh that you mentioned, like Gain. We are not seeing any trade down as of yet to uh private label.\nAnd so perhaps we're seeing a switch from Tide Pods to regular Tide detergent, but it's not just smaller household goods. We're also seeing this when it comes to larger ticket items, too. Whirlpool CEO, Marc Bitzer, said on its earnings call that weakness, when it comes to consumer sentiment, impacted both demand and led consumers to choose to mix into lower end products. Of course, Whirlpool sells those high ticket KitchenAid mixers, too, like I've been hoping to get my hands on. And if you think you were thinking about a home renovation, well chances are you're looking for value there, too. Lowe's CEO told me over the phone that consumers are, quote, \"waiting for more confidence in the economy before they spend.\" And they're leaning into this larger concept of both value and Lowe's also leaning into that loyalty reward membership. They said that both those things are really working for them. They exited July with same-store sales growth up 4.7%, and CEO Marvin Ellison said to Yahoo Finance, quote, \"We want to make sure we know how to offer our customers a value to get them to shop us versus the competition. We did this in the second quarter, and we think when the weather trends improved, we saw positive responses to this methodology. And we're hoping we'll see the same response when it hits the back half of the year.\" And the chances are you're likely seeking value all the way to your clothes closet, too. Have you shopped at a discount retailer lately? Well, TJ Maxx, the off-price retailer, had a stellar quarter, too. Same-store sales grew 4%, and CFO, John Klinger, said customer transactions increased at every division. \"We see this as an excellent indicator of the strength of our value proposition across our retail banners.\" Bottom line here, guys, value is the name of the game as we make our way into the back half of the year."

      "text": "Markets are shifting their rate cut expectations following more dovish-than-expected commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday.\nOppenheimer senior analyst and managing director Kristen Owen joins Market Domination to discuss how to invest in the industrials sector as the macro environment evolves. She also shares some of her top stock picks in the space.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.\nIndustrials, the top performing sector in the S&P 500 so far this year, up more than 16% now year to date, and as markets rally around Fed chair Jerome Powell's comments on the path forward for interest rates, there could be some interesting opportunities for investors within Industrials. We're now going to had a play this space with the Yahoo Finance playbook. Joining us Christian Owen, senior analyst and managing director at Oppenheimer. Kristen, it is good to see you. So let's start with the news today, Kristen, that would be J Powell. Jackson Hole seems to be suggesting there, Kristen, a policy pivot is on the way. Let's say that happens. What could that broadly mean for the Industrials you cover, Kristen?\nYeah, thanks Josh for having me on. Um it is an interesting day and one where we're seeing a little bit of exuberance come back into the market. And I think the expectation here is um one both a little bit of clarity, and this has been a market that has been missing uh clarity thus far this year. So a little bit better uncertain better certainty uh with respect to the September rate cuts. Uh but also a little bit better on the affordability front. When you think about industrials, I mean we're talking about capital equipment, capital goods. These are these are tend to be large uh in some cases multi-million dollar investments uh that really make our economy run. And so if um if we are at a point where we're now starting to see rates come down, or the expectation that rates are going to come down, that affordability piece gets a little less challenged. Um and the decision to make some of those larger investments becomes a little bit easier here. So the way that I look at it, um we've got some some certain pockets of the market where there are some clear opportunities. Uh when you look at who's responding well today and you see a name like caterpillar up 4%, um certainly getting some benefit from the opportunity for resi improvement. And that's something where, you know, we think that there is a real opportunity now in anticipation of rate cuts that that could revive uh this resi sector that's been bumping along the bottom. Uh a few other names in that in that space that we like. Uh Trimble would would be one that we'd put in that bucket. A little bit less capital intensive, but but certainly tied to that affordability and and improving uh resi and housing outlook. Um, so leave it there. I mean we we have a lot of opportunities here for for the affordability to get a bit better.\nAnd Kristen, you know, for investors, the Fed, one critical theme. Trade is another, Kristen. I think about trade tensions. I think about some of those industrials being front and center. I'm just curious how how the names you cover, Kristen, how they've been sort of just navigating that that tariff dynamic, mitigation strategies, levers they've been pulling.\nYeah, Josh, I started with this idea of clarity or certainty and that's something that has really been a challenge for a lot of uh of the companies in this space. And and that's primarily related to the tariff backdrop. How we've seen most of our companies respond thus far is take a a slow and steady approach. It is how can we control the controllables? Let's try to make um our any move that we take more palatable for our customers. Meaning it's not necessarily a knee-jerk reaction to increase price. Let's see what we can do within our own supply chain. And let's not make any non uh or any regrettable decisions at this point, given that we haven't had a lot of clarity on what that tariff backdrop is going to look like. So some of the other uh developments this week, a little bit more codification on what EU tariffs are going to look like. That's going to create a little bit more certainty for how do I address my supply base that may be coming from Europe? How do I think about the section 232 or the steel and aluminum tariffs when I'm starting to think about how I build this piece of equipment or this piece of machinery? And first and foremost starting with the supply chain before thinking about, do I need to reshore? Do I need to bring more of that manufacturing back either to the United States or under USMCA compliance?\nKristen, I want to end here with some picks, some names. Caterpillar is one name I know you mentioned. I know you like that. You also like deer. Why is that one to buy here, Kristen?\nI mean, deer is one that can also benefit from the construction side of the business. We don't often talk about deer's construction business. Certainly more well-known for its ag business. But that's one that that can benefit from this affordability backdrop. Um on the ag cycle, I mean ag tends to move to the beat of its own drum. And from that respect, deer is the best-in-class name that you can own in the ag machinery space. Um and what we would really benefit from uh in addition to the rate cut is really understanding what trade policy is going to look like from an agricultural market perspective. That's going to be more meaningful for the commodities backdrop. That's really going to be the kicker to deer shares here. Right now what we like about deer is with a little bit of help from the macro, you can still get earnings growth next year. And that's what's currently being priced into the stock. On top of that, you get a nice dividend, you get a high-quality management team, strong free cash flow conversion. These are all things that for a multi-year investor really screen quite well here.\nAnd how about CNH, Kristen?\nCNH is much more of a self-help story here and hasn't had as much of a run as deer has had. So you don't have that premium multiple applied for CNH. We think that actually creates a multiple opportunity for them. They've called out 350 to 450 basis points of operating margin opportunity just within their control, just by executing better, better quality equipment, integrating more of their own technology into their machines. So when I think about deer versus CNH, you know, deer is probably already well priced for a lot of the um the premium execution that they get. CNH has a little bit more of a catch-up opportunity and is trading at a slightly lower multiple. So a little bit more attractive valuation relative to deer.\nKristen, appreciate your time and those picks. Have a great weekend.\nThanks Josh."

Median total pay tallied $19 million. Wow. So my question is this, why are CEOs becoming even more overpaid? And are they worth it, Patrick? Over to you because a lot of the CEOs in here are big tech CEOs. Are big tech CEOs deserving of this very, very high compensation? Is is their job that important?\nWell, I I think they deserve it if they're driving returns for shareholders. And that's what, you know, the data misses, which is most of their compensation is tied to increase in the the stock price, right? Uh you know, their salaries are are reasonable, right? Um in the millions, um maybe even less, but they're really all tied to appreciation. So, yes, I think they are deserve deserved of that. And if and when the market starts going down, uh they will make less money.\nBrooke, a lot of these names are also uh a lot of these CEOs are also in the retail space. Um I suspect you and I will eventually be on a list like this.\nI mean, fingers crossed certainly, but what we have heard is you know, uh, Starbucks CEO, for example, his a paycheck, Brian Nickel there about 94% from what I know, is uh his pay comes from stock awards that are tied to the company's performance. And ultimately, this is something that many companies' board of directors have been leaning into, this idea that if the company does well, so will the executives do well here. And what we've seen is it certainly play out. I mean Starbucks is in the midst of a turnaround strategy here. We also know that other retail giants that have performed well, also have have compensated their executives well. And so certainly we're in this environment where board of directors are certainly leaning into this idea because they ultimately want to make investors happy, especially at these record high stock performance that we've been seeing.\nPeter, how do you assess a CEO and their impact on a business?\nWell, it's interesting to compare, say, Jeff Bezos. So I think his annual salary was like $80,000 a year. I mean, Really took one for the team, Peter. Really took one for the team. never took never got any shares. Like he owns a big chunk of Amazon, but he never got any additional shares from the board. And you contrast that with, you know, another CEO. I won't tell you his name. I'll just say his first name is Elon. Won't tell you his last name. Um, who has had the board just issue tons and tons of shares to him. I don't know. I don't know. I I I like Bezos' model a bit more. Uh Amazon was a successful company without the board having to issue him a lot of additional shares. I think other companies can look to that."
