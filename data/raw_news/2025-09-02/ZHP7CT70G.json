  "title": "What's causing the UK's long-term borrowing costs to rise?",
  "description": "The cost of government borrowing has risen again - what does it mean for the public finances and upcoming Budget?",
  "content": "There is a lot of noise currently about UK government borrowing costs. The focus has been on what is known as the 30-year gilt yield, which is the effective interest rate of what it would cost the UK government to borrow money over three decades. This rate reached a 27-year high on Tuesday, which some argue is a verdict on economic mismanagement and fiscal credibility. The bond vigilantes are striking, and this is the ultimate harbinger of doom. Is there a link to the mini reshuffle of Downing Street personnel from Number 11 to Number 10 on Monday? For others analysing market moves, it is a pan-European trend, and if anything, a sign of UK growth outperformance, meaning there is less room to cut interest rates.\n\nIt is worth quickly unpacking what this measure represents. This is about trading on financial markets of a very long-term form of UK government debt - essentially loans taken out for 30 years. Demand for these assets goes up and down, setting the price, which in turn affects what is known as the yield, a measure of the effective interest rate facing the government. It is that 30-year gilt yield that has hit a new 27-year high after creeping up over the summer. The UK is not alone in this. Other European countries have also seen such records set in recent days.\n\nThe time period for these loans is quite important in determining the overall impact on the economy. The 30-year gilt is important in sectors requiring long-term returns: pensions and insurance. Ultra long government loans are especially important for defined benefit pensions systems, which need fixed and predictable payouts over long periods. One of the reasons why this has affected a series of European countries has been structural changes in pensions markets that is reducing the demand for such long-term debt. But some general doubts about the political and economic sustainability of tax and spending plans in Europe is also part of the context here.\n\nThere are two critical differences to what happened, for example, at the infamous mini-Budget of three years ago. Firstly the rise in yields at that point was more rapid. Secondly, back in 2022 UK government debt across a series of time frames (known as maturities) was affected. Two-year and five-year government loans have a direct influence on fixed-rate mortgages of the same time frame. The mortgage market reacted in real time to the UK-specific sudden crisis. So far, this year, the cost of mortgages has continued to fall. Only 30-year mortgages might be impacted by the record set today, but they remain exceptionally rare in the UK. The 10-year gilt is the benchmark for government bonds, and that was up a bit on Tuesday as well, but remains below the highs set earlier this year. There was no lack of appetite from markets however for the debt, banks put in \u00a3140bn of bids for \u00a314bn in debt this morning. There is, however, one factor in common with 2022. These important markets also have half an eye on the Bank of England. In particular, this month the Bank will set out its plans for the sell-off its own stock of government debt, amassed over years. The reality is that with both the Treasury and the Bank auctioning off truckloads of these debts, there is a lot to digest, and markets will remain skittish, against the backdrop of multiple diplomatic, trade and political uncertainties. The moves in the 30-year gilt are a warning sign of bond sharks scenting some blood in the water. Some of it might be heading toward Paris in the coming days where ministers are publicly warning of an IMF crisis amid unremitting political uncertainty. The smaller moves in the 10-year gilt can impact more directly the chancellor's room for manoeuvre at her upcoming Budget. The lack of movement at shorter time frames means there is limited direct impact on UK household finances, for now. This would be, however, pretty much the worst time for the government to show division, lack of certainty and credibility. Markets have long memories when governments fail to pass their announced Budget measures, especially when it arises surprisingly within administrations with thumping majorities. Some traders identify the move of the chancellor's deputy, Darren Jones, and other Treasury officials to Number 10 on \"Transfer Deadline Day\" yesterday as a sign that Reeves's control is weakening. Others may see a more coherent operation between the two Lords of the Treasury. All of this raises the stakes for the chancellor's challenge of delivering both credible tax and spend plans, as well as jump-starting growth at her upcoming Budget.",

      "text": "What economic levers are left for Reeves to pull?\n- Published\nA forecast is just a forecast, but the significance of today's pessimistic analysis by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr)is that it does reflect scenarios being considered in the Treasury ahead of the Budget in the autumn.\nAs I wrote last month, it is not just the accumulation of U-turns, and sluggish economic news which is driving the framing of another important Treasury moment in the autumn.\nThe Chancellor Rachel Reeves may choose to make a strategic decision to reflect the current global uncertainties by establishing significantly greater room for manoeuvre to hit her borrowing limits.\nCurrently that buffer is a very tight \u00a310bn.\nThe Niesr report points to the need to re-establish what it calls \"a large buffer\" against missing her fiscal rules.\nThe absence of this has led to what Niesr called \"piecemeal policy tinkering\" that had given rise to \"prolonged economic uncertainty\".\nSo there could be a move towards getting more bad news out of the way now, to break the doom loop of people constantly expecting policy changes and tax rises.\n- Published6 August\n- Published12 July\nThe borrowing rules stipulate that day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing and debt should be falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30.\nNiesr does not recommend changing the new borrowing rules, which have only just been established, at this stage.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and others have floated the idea that the Treasury should only really make Budget changes once a year to stop the uncertainty.\nThe IMF also suggested bigger buffers as the best idea.\nAll this matters because it could mean that earlier estimates of a need to bridge a budget gap of \u00a315-20bn a year with tax rises or spending cuts in the autumn, are a material underestimate.\nNiesr's forecast of a \u00a340-50bn gap is on the pessimistic side, and there are still many moving parts before the Autumn, but it does show that the scale of the challenge is not easing for the chancellor.\nWith most spending now fixed, and political challenges over welfare cuts, that would leave tax rises as the main lever.\nWhile the government promised not to change the main rates of tax, Niesr points to scope to further raise revenue through changes to the scope of VAT, pensions allowances, council tax and prolonging the freeze in income tax thresholds.\nIf Niesr are right, it could be all of the above.\nOf course, economic news has been mixed in recent weeks.\nWe'll get further information on Thursday when the Bank of England is set to decide on a further interest rate cut and issue its new economic forecasts.\nAnd next week, the important GDP figures for the second quarter are due to be released and they're expected to show the UK is no longer the fastest growing economy of the major G7 economies."

      "text": "UK borrowing costs hit 27-year high adding to pressure on Reeves\n- Published\nUK government borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1998, adding to the pressure on the chancellor ahead of the Budget.\nThe interest rate on 30-year government bonds, known as the yield, jumped to 5.698%, making it more expensive for the government to borrow money.\nThere are rising expectations that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will increase taxes in the Budget later this year in order to meet her financial rules, as worries grow about the state of the government's finances.\nOn the currency markets, the pound also fell more than 1% against the dollar on Tuesday morning.\nThe pound fell to $1.3379, which was its lowest level against the US currency since 7 August.\nThe UK was not alone in seeing borrowing costs rise, with yields on 30-year German, French and Dutch bonds climbing to their highest levels since 2011.\nA number of factors have led to borrowing costs for governments around the globe to go up, such as geopolitical tensions, US President Donald Trump's trade policies and the upcoming confidence vote in the French government.\n- Published14 February\n- Published12 June\n- Published5 days ago\nInvestors 'clearly concerned'\nBut Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown, said the UK chancellor faced \"highly difficult choices\" in the Budget and that she had been \"dealt a warning\" by investors.\n\"They are selling off UK government debt, clearly concerned that the government may be losing its grip on the public finances,\" she added.\nIn its manifesto, Labour promised not to raise taxes such as income tax, VAT or national insurance on \"working people\", and this has led to much speculation over what taxes Reeves could raise in the autumn Budget.\nOne option suggested is that the freeze on income tax thresholds, which is due to end in 2028, could be extended. The freeze means that, over time, more people are dragged into paying higher tax rates.\nThere have also been reports that Reeves is considering reforming property taxes.\n\"With so many options for raising taxes being bandied about during the summer, there appears to be concern that the decisions made might not be sufficiently thought through,\" said Ms Streeter.\n\"The worry isn't just that government coffers won't be replenished, but that they will be filled at the expense of growth, leading to a vicious circle emerging.\"\nOn Monday, the government announced a partial reshuffle, with Darren Jones, formerly Reeves's deputy, being given a key No 10 role by the prime minister.\nThe changes are focused on beefing up the economic know-how in Downing Street, with Baroness Shafik, the PM's new chief economic adviser and former deputy governor of the Bank of England, being appointed.\nThe moves are a recognition that the upcoming autumn's Budget will be a defining moment this Labour government.\nGovernments borrow money from investors by selling bonds - which is a loan the government promises to pay back at the end of an agreed time.\nThe yield on 30-year UK government bonds - known as gilts - has been rising for some months, and this makes it more expensive for the government to borrow money due to higher interest payments.\nThe government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), takes borrowing costs into account when looking at whether the chancellor is meeting her self-imposed fiscal rules.\nWhen she became chancellor, Reeves set out two rules on government borrowing, which she has repeatedly said are \"non-negotiable\". These were:\nday-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30\nto get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30\nPart of the reason Reeves is under pressure is that her financial buffer to stick to these rules is a relatively slim \u00a310bn. The chancellor recently refused to rule out tax rises after disappointing data on economic growth.\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for Keir Starmer said the government's \"iron-clad commitment to our robust fiscal rules remains\", adding it had made the necessary decisions to \"stabilise the public finances\".\nBut shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the latest market movements were \"another economic disaster from Rachel Reeves - and a clear vote of no confidence in Labour from the markets\".\n\"With more tax rises on the horizon, the economy is now in a precarious position,\" he added.\nThere has been a wide range of forecasts for how much money Reeves might need to raise in the Budget to meet her rules.\nOne factor that will influence this is the borrowing costs facing the government.\nWhen the OBR makes makes its forecasts for government debt it looks at yields on all bonds.\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said concerns about the path of UK inflation and interest rates, combined with global issues, were pushing UK government borrowing costs up.\nIn addition, he added that pension funds were also not buying as much long-term government debt due to the change in recent years from defined-benefit to defined-contribution schemes.\nMr Dales said Reeves would have to raise between \u00a318bn and \u00a328bn in the Budget to avoid breaking her fiscal rules, and to maintain her \u00a310bn buffer.\nHouseholds and banks \"will probably feel the brunt of the higher taxes\", he said."
