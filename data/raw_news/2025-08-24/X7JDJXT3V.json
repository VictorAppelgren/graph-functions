Today\u2019s puzzle is easier; I got it in four. Beware, there are spoilers below for August 25, Wordle #1,528! Keep scrolling if you want some hints (and then the answer) to today\u2019s Wordle game.\n\nWordle lives here on the New York Times website . A new puzzle goes live every day at midnight, your local time.\n\nStart by guessing a five-letter word. The letters of the word will turn green if they\u2019re correct, yellow if you have the right letter in the wrong place, or gray if the letter isn\u2019t in the day\u2019s secret word at all. For more, check out our guide to playing Wordle here , and my strategy guide here for more advanced tips . (We also have more information at the bottom of this post, after the hints and answers.)\n\nReady for the hints? Let\u2019s go!\n\nDoes today\u2019s Wordle have any unusual letters?\n\nWe\u2019ll define common letters as those that appear in the ETAOIN SHRDLU. (Memorize this! Pronounce it \u201cEdwin Shirdloo,\u201d like a name, and pretend he\u2019s a friend of yours.)\n\nThere are four common letters from our mnemonic today. The fifth is pretty common too.\n\nCan you give me a hint for today\u2019s Wordle?\n\nDoes today\u2019s Wordle have any double or repeated letters?\n\nThere are no repeated letters today.\n\nHow many vowels are in today\u2019s Wordle?\n\nThere is one vowel.\n\nWhat letter does today\u2019s Wordle start with?\n\nWhat letter does today\u2019s Wordle end with?\n\nWhat is the solution to today\u2019s Wordle?\n\nI started with RAISE and TOUCH then guessed BIRTH as a possible solution. I tried MIRTH next.\n\nYesterday\u2019s Wordle was harder. The hint was \"may be found on a plant or fungus\u201d and the answer contained four common letters and one pretty common letter.\n\nThe answer to yesterday\u2019s Wordle was SPORE.\n\nThe idea of Wordle is to guess the day\u2019s secret word. When you first open the Wordle game, you\u2019ll see an empty grid of letters. It\u2019s up to you to make the first move: type in any five-letter word.\n\nNow, you can use the colors that are revealed to get clues about the word: Green means you correctly guessed a letter, and it\u2019s in the correct position. (For example, if you guess PARTY, and the word is actually PURSE, the P and R will be green.)\n\u2022 None Yellow means the letter is somewhere in the word, but not in the position you guessed it. (For example, if you guessed PARTY, but the word is actually ROAST, the R, A and T will all be yellow.)\n\u2022 None Gray means the letter is not in the solution word at all. (If you guessed PARTY and everything is gray, then the solution cannot be PURSE or ROAST.)\n\nWith all that in mind, guess another word, and then another, trying to land on the correct word before you run out of chances. You get six guesses, and then it\u2019s game over.\n\nThe best starter words for Wordle\n\nWhat should you play for that first guess? The best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that\u2019s still excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn\u2019t a single \u201cbest\u201d starting word, but the New York Times\u2019s has suggested starting with one of these:\n\nMeanwhile, an MIT analysis that you\u2019ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:\n\nOther good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it\u2019s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.\n\nHow to win at Wordle\n\nWe have a few guides to Wordle strategy, which you might like to read over if you\u2019re a serious student of the game. covers how to use consonants to your advantage, while focuses on a strategy that uses the most common letters. In , we detail a three-pronged approach for fishing for hints while maximizing your chances of winning quickly.\n\nThe biggest thing that separates Wordle winners from Wordle losers is that winners use their guesses to gather information about what letters are in the word . If you know that the word must end in -OUND, don\u2019t waste four guesses on MOUND, ROUND, SOUND, and HOUND; combine those consonants and guess MARSH. If the H lights up in yellow, you know the solution.\n\nOne more note on strategy: the original Wordle used a list of about 2,300 solution words, but after the game was bought by the NYT, the game now has an editor who hand-picks the solutions . Sometimes they are slightly tricky words that wouldn\u2019t have made the original list, and sometimes they are topical. For example, FEAST was the solution one Thanksgiving. So keep in mind that there may be a theme.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get enough of five-letter guessing games and their kin, the , ranked by difficulty, include:\n\u2022 None Wheeldle, which lets you play one puzzle after another\n\u2022 None and , which ask you to play two (Dordle) or four (Quordle) puzzles at the same time, with the same guesses. There is also , with eight puzzles, and , with 16.\n\u2022 None , which shows you several five-letter words, scrambled in a grid ; you play by swapping the letters around until you solve.\n\u2022 None , which changes the solution after each guess , but needs to stay consistent with its previous feedback. You have to strategically back it into a corner until there is only one possible word left; then you guess it, and win.\n\u2022 None , in which you play Wordle against other people with a timer running . You take damage if you spend too much time between guesses; winner is the last one standing.\n\u2022 None , in which you are trying not to guess the day\u2019s solution . You\u2019re required to reuse any letters that you (oops) guessed correctly, so the longer it takes you, the better you are at the game.\n\nNot the day you're after?

  "summary": "The New York Times website's Wordle game, which goes live every day at midnight, has provided some hints and answers for August 25, 2025. The puzzle involves guessing a five-letter word, with letters turning green if they're correct, yellow if they have the right letter in the wrong place, or gray if the letter isn't in the day\u2019s secret word at all. The winner will then be able to solve the puzzle with six guesses. The game is designed to guess the day's secret word and eliminate the most possibilities in the first round. The best starter words for Wordle tend to contain common letters, and an MIT analysis suggests that an MIT study suggests that starting with one of these could help eliminate the majority of possibilities.",

      "text": "Are you too good at Wordle? Of course you are. You know all the strategies: which words to guess first, which vowels to test right out of the gate. You\u2019re probably sick of embarrassing everyone on Twitter with all your green squares. If Wordle feels too easy these days, you might want to try its twisted cousin, Absurdle.\nDeveloped by qntm, the game follows most of the same rules as Wordle. You guess a five-letter word; if you see a green square over a letter, you have the correct letter in the correct spot; if you see a yellow square, you have a correct letter in an incorrect space; and if you see a gray square, that letter is not in the word at all.\nIn Wordle, you have six chances to get the word right. Absurdle, however, gives you unlimited attempts. Before you scoff, however, consider the other major difference between the two: Every time you guess wrong in Absurdle, the solution to the puzzle changes.\nBut that\u2019s not all; Absurdle isn\u2019t just picking one word and seeing if you match, it\u2019s picking as many similar words to your word as possible in an attempt to prolong your Absurdle game as long as possible. If your initial guess was SPEAK, Absurdle will run through every word in its database that doesn\u2019t contain those letters, and that pool of words will be its answer key. As such, it\u2019s impossible to guess the word on the first try. It\u2019s also impossible to guess on the second. According to qntm, the shortest possible Absurdle game is four turns.\nWhat you\u2019re really trying to do is back the game into a corner; once it\u2019s impossible for there to be any unique words that contain none of the letters you guessed, you\u2019ll start to see yellow and green squares appear in your guesses. Absurdle will still switch up the possible words, but that pool gets smaller and smaller as you continue guessing. Eventually, there will only be one possible word left based on the way the game has progressed, and, essentially, it then turns back into regular Wordle.\nA key thing to remember about Absurdle is that it\u2019s entirely deterministic. Unlike Wordle, which has one set answer that changes day to day, using the same guesses in Absurdle will always result in the same outcome. The game is designed that way, since there\u2019s no \u201canswer\u201d from the start.\nIf these rules sound a little confusing, don\u2019t worry; qntm has an extended explainer on how the entire thing works. The best way to understand Absurdle, however, is to play it.\n[PC Mag]\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "I like to think I am pretty good with words. I\u2019ve been working in journalism and digital media for most of my career; I\u2019ve written thousands of articles and blog posts; I\u2019ve edited perhaps tens of thousands; I\u2019ve committed various grammar guides and style books to unconscious memory. But my wife still kicks my ass at Boggle every time. And Scrabble. And\u2014more recently\u2014Wordle.\nShe\u2019s seriously good at any game that involves mixing around letters and manipulating the English language. I feel no shame in losing to her (which is good, because I do it all the time), but it can be dispiriting, especially when she plays at a disadvantage by, say, giving the rest of the family a 30-second head start at Boggle and still wipes the floor with me.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nGiven that context, it will not surprise you to learn that she is much better at Wordle than I am, and I am not bad; I\u2019ve been playing for 26 days and have yet to be stumped, and I\u2019ve solved 16 of those puzzles in 4 guesses or less. Two-thirds of the times, she\u2019s done it in three. (Though it feels nice, she points out, your starter words are more information seeking than anything else; winning in less than three guesses is just luck.) And if I\u2019m being honest, a large part of my own success is due to the fact that I\u2019ve stolen adopted her strategy.\nThe best way to choose starter words in Wordle\nSo here\u2019s how to do it. It\u2019s a modified version of the generally recommended strategy, which is to choose two or three \u201cstarter words\u201d filled with common letters. But while most people go for words that will knock a bunch of vowels out right away (during a recent discussion among Lifehacker staff members, we settled on \u201cBEAST\u201d and \u201cROUND\u201d as good choices), her words focus on common consonants. You want to think a starter word that feature more of those, and then base your second and subsequent guesses on what you learn from there. If you happen upon an L in the second spot, that narrows down your possible starting letters considerably; a certain consonant in the middle or at the end of a word can tell you a lot about probable vowel placement., which can be just as important as knowing what the vowel actually is. Because when you think about it, hw mch do vwls actlly mttr in englsh?\n\u201cYou\u2019re too worried about getting your vowels,\u201d she told me yesterday, when she got \u201cSHARD\u201d in four guesses to my six (phew!). \u201cThere are only five of them, and it\u2019s almost never going to be a U.\u201d And that\u2019s very true. There are only five of them. (And sometimes Y.) Prioritizing consonants will help you avoid a common pitfall, when you\u2019ve figured out three or four letters of the word but face a choice of six or seven possible starting or ending letters (SHARD, SHARP, SHARK, CHARD, CHARM). Focus on letter frequency and letter combinations that appear frequently in English. Think about the shape of the word: If you know it ends in an R or the second letter in an L, that tells you something about vowel placement. Perhaps this is a simple strategy, but Wordle is an exceedingly simple game, though not so simple that the New York Times wasn\u2019t willing to pay seven figures for it.\nSo as you enjoy these last, joyous days before the game slips behind a paywall or out of pop culture altogether, consider using my wife\u2019s winning strategy. She\u2019s been having a lot of luck with \u201cRENTS\u201d and \u201cCLAMP.\u201d\n(\u201cIt\u2019s not luck,\u201d she would no doubt note. \u201cIt\u2019s skill.\u201d And she would be right.)\nNot the day you're after?

      "text": "I solved today\u2019s Wordle in three guesses, which I thought was no biggie. It seemed like an easy word. But according to social media, today\u2019s Wordle is devilishly hard.\nFriends, if you lost Wordle today, you\u2019re wordling wrong and it\u2019s time for an intervention. (Warning: this post contains outright spoilers for Wordle #668.)\nWhy today\u2019s Wordle was so hard\nYou\u2019re not alone if you found this one tough. Wordlebot reports that the average solution comes in 4.7 guesses; the bot itself seemed to be unable to solve the puzzle according to some screenshots I saw online. (By the time I ran today\u2019s puzzle through the bot, it had figured out how to solve in five guesses.) Here\u2019s a tweet that is pretty representative of the trouble people were having: You figure out most of the word, and then run out of guesses trying to find the missing letter.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nI think we\u2019re far enough down the page that I can now spell out what the problem is: the last four letters of today\u2019s word were -OUND. There are more than six words that end that way, meaning you can\u2019t just guess them one at a time and expect to land on the answer. It could be BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, POUND ROUND, SOUND, or WOUND.\nUse your guesses to eliminate possibilities\nWhen you\u2019re on your second or third guess of the day, and you know there are seven more possibilities, don\u2019t just start guessing solutions. That\u2019s like being 20 minutes into a family road trip and asking \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d Of course not!\nInstead, figure out how many possibilities you might be dealing with, and come up with a guess that rules out as many of them as possible. (This strategy doesn\u2019t work in Hard Mode, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s Hard Mode. Hard Mode takes the most effective strategies away and forces you to rely more on luck.)\nSo let\u2019s say you just guessed POUND, so now you know the word ends in -OUND but that it doesn\u2019t start with P. What else could it start with? It could be BOUND, FOUND, and so on. Once you realize there are a bunch of possibilities, grab a scrap of paper and jot them down: B, F, H, M, R, S, W. The smart move is to put as many of those letters as you can into your next guess. For a few examples, any of the following words will force Wordle to give us a verdict on four of the seven possibilities in our list:\nMARSH (H, M, R, S)\nSWARM (M, R, S, W)\nBRUSH (B, H, R, S)\nWHARF (H, F, R, W)\nIn today\u2019s puzzle, three of those will give you a yellow on \u201cH,\u201d and the puzzle is as good as solved. But if you chose SWARM and got all blanks, you\u2019ve still made a lot of progress: You know that the only possibilities left are B, F, and H.\n(By the way, this is one of Wordlebot\u2019s flaws, and it might be one of yours too: Assuming that you learned nothing about the secret word if you didn\u2019t get any greens or yellows. That\u2019s not true! It means you\u2019ve ruled out a bunch of common letters as possibilities, and reduced the pool of possible solutions to a much smaller number. The all-blank lines are actually jackpots.)\nSo you guessed POUND and SWARM, and you\u2019re still stumped. Well, your only options now are BOUND, HOUND, and FOUND. Can we think of a word that uses all three of B, F, and H? Maybe not. But two will do. Guess FABLE (for the B and F) and you\u2019ll get zero hits. Bingo\u2014you now know the answer has an H and ends in OUND. It\u2019s HOUND.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "One thing that sets Wordle apart from other games is that you face a grid with no clues whatsoever at the start. You get to make the first move, and gameplay follows from your choices. Your starting word matters\u2014so what do you choose?\nA few things are obvious. It\u2019s strategic to use five different letters (TRAIN rather than TATTY), and you probably want most or all of the five to be common letters in English; as I\u2019ve explained elsewhere, I use the mnemonic ETAOIN SHRDLU (pronounced like \u201cEdwin Shirdloo\u201d) as my guide.\nBut that still leaves a lot of possibilities, and everybody has their own preferences. Some folks like to get their vowels set as early as possible; AUDIO and ADIEU will get you off to a good start there. Others could care less about the vowels, and would prefer to knock out as many consonants as possible in the first guess: TRASH would be a good starter for that approach. Another equally valid approach is to screw strategy and throw in whatever word is bouncing around in your head that day. I used UNION every day that we were on strike, and never lost.\nWhat the computers say\nWhile only trial and error can tell you what you prefer, computers have been hard at work on calculating the mathematical properties of certain words. The way a computer thinks about this, there are only so many five-letter words that can be valid solutions. (Wordle\u2019s creator chose about 2,300 words for the solution list, leaving out a lot of obscure ones that most of us are happy to ignore.)\nEach time you guess a word and see the resulting colored tiles, that original word list has been divided into two groups: words that could be the answer based on what you now know, and words that definitely cannot. For example, if you guess PLANT and get a green P, we know that PURSE is still possible, but SPARE is not (because it does not start with a P).\nBy that logic, you can score a word based on how well it narrows down the solution space. This turns out to be a difficult problem to figure out whether you have solved it optimally, making it exactly the kind of problem that computer scientists love. A recent paper out of MIT performed an analysis of the ways different guesses can break down the solution space, and claims that with the right strategy, all Wordle games can be solved in five guesses or less. Here are their picks for the best starting words:\nSALET\nREAST\nTRACE\nCRATE\nSLATE\nThat\u2019s in contrast to the New York Times\u2019 WordleBot, which used a reportedly less computationally intensive approach to come up with the following favorite starters:\nCRANE\nTRACE\nSLANT\nCRATE\nCARTE\nHow to follow up a good starter\nChoosing a good starter is just the beginning, of course. Where do you go with your next guess? The authors of the MIT paper helpfully include a tool to help you find the next word to play after SALET. Just take note of your greens and yellows, and find the matching row of colored blocks on page 14. Play the word it tells you, and chances are you\u2019ll be able to solve the puzzle quickly.\nI tried out the chart on a few rounds of Dordle, and can confirm that it narrows down the possibilities very efficiently. (The authors say they have created a website, wordleopt.com, for even easier use, but at the moment it isn\u2019t loading for me.)\nOne problem with this approach is that often the best word to narrow down your possibilities is not, itself, on the 2,300-word list. GHYLL, for example, is never going to be a Wordle solution even though the puzzle accepts it as a word. Is your goal to make sure you never lose? If so, guessing obscure words that narrow down the possibilities is a good strategy. But if your goal is to win in as few guesses as possible, you probably want to give yourself more chances to luck into an early hit. (SALET is not on the word list; guessing SALET and GHYLL means the earliest you could solve is on your third move.)\nPersonally, I like to use a starter that is both itself a valid word, and lends itself to a second guess that also meets starter criteria. For example, I\u2019ve been starting lately with ARISE. I might then follow that up with TOUCH. By the time I\u2019ve played both, I now have information on nine out of the 12 letters in ETAOIN SHRDLU (plus C, which is the next-most-common letter after those). My brain is no supercomputer, but my stats indicate that I\u2019ve solved 35% of all my Wordles in three guesses or less.\nTell me in the comments: What is your favorite starter word? And, most importantly, what factors went into choosing that one?\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "Much has happened in the world of Wordle since we first posted a roundup of the best variations on the now iconic word-guessing game. It turns out there are more ways to guess a five-letter word than we ever thought possible, ranging from the fun and trivial to the devilishly devious. So let\u2019s take a tour of 10 of the best Wordle alternatives, which I\u2019ve ranked from easiest to hardest.\nWheeldle\nWheeldle is a simple solution for anyone who just wants Wordle, but more of it, and all at once. The screen is set up like a video game: when you correctly guess a word, a number is added to a running counter and you get a new, blank grid. Fill a grid without guessing correctly, and it\u2019s game over. You can play as many times as you want, and aim for a high score.\nQuordle\nWhen we made our first roundup, the idea of doing two Wordles at once\u2014a game called Dordle\u2014was new, exciting, and frustrating. But once you get the hang of it, it becomes just as easy as original Wordle, and you need to seek out stronger stuff. Quordle is the sweet spot for me, personally: Guessing four puzzles at once means that every guess is likely to get you a green or yellow somewhere.\nHurdle\nHurdle gives you five puzzles for the price of one. But I\u2019m ranking it as harder than Wheeldle for the twist at the end: After you\u2019ve solved the first four (in which the solution of each puzzle becomes your starter for the next), you\u2019re presented with a grid in which all four of the previous solutions are already filled in. You now have only two guesses to work with as you attempt to clear the final hurdle.\nWaffle\nWaffle is the Rubik\u2019s cube of Wordles, a grid where every part of every answer is in front of you, if only you can figure out how to move everything into the right place. You are allowed 15 swaps before the game is over, and you\u2019re rewarded with gold stars if you can solve it in fewer.\nSedecordle\nRemember Dordle (two simultaneous puzzles) and Quordle (four)? We\u2019re going to skip right past Octordle for the moment, because I\u2019m declaring the format\u2019s pinnacle to be Sedecordle (16 puzzles). Yes, there are so many puzzles that you can only see two out of the 16 on the screen at any one time\u2014and you are given so many guesses that, depending on the size of screen you\u2019re working with, you can\u2019t even necessarily see each whole game board. But the game\u2019s creators have kindly given us a scoreboard at the top showing which of the puzzles you have already solved, and how many guesses you have left. If that\u2019s still not enough for you, there is, of course, Duotrigordle.\nAbsurdle\nWe featured this one in the original roundup, but it\u2019s making an appearance again because this game doesn\u2019t get really enjoyable until you spend a lot of time on it. If you only tried it once, you really need to come back to it when you have a free evening.\nAbsurdle\u2019s setup is that you\u2019re playing against a computer that keeps changing its guesses, but it has to abide by whatever clues (green and yellow letters) it\u2019s already given you. This means that you actually have control over the game. Don\u2019t think of yourself as \u201cguessing\u201d the word; think of it as backing the AI into a corner, cutting off its access to the word families that make the game drag on (SPARE, SPADE, SKATE). One day I found a series of moves that guaranteed I would win in five guesses; that was a good day.\nSquabble\nReady to get competitive? In Squabble, you\u2019re playing Wordle against other people, and against the clock. There\u2019s a timer, but it\u2019s labeled as a health meter. When you guess correctly, you heal your own damage and deal damage to other players. The winner is the last one standing.\np3nto\nThis two-player app is another competitive word guessing game. It predates Wordle, but the creator has added a \u201cWordle mode\u201d that adopts the mechanics of the game we know and love. It\u2019s harder, though: You\u2019re playing blind. There are no green and yellow squares or color-coded keyboard, just a pop-up message that tells you how many letters you guessed in the correct locations. It\u2019s definitely harder than regular Wordle. Good luck.\nSquardle\nSquardle is like Waffle\u2019s evil twin. The five-letter words are arranged in a grid, but it starts out blank. You must guess two words at once (your initial guess is entered into the first row and first column) and in return you get a flurry of color-coded clues attached to each square. Resisting the information overload is half the fun. It is possible to win this game, I promise.\nAntiwordle\nWhile I gave a lot of thought to the rankings on this list, one game was guaranteed the dead-last spot: Antiwordle is literally impossible to win. The best you can do is prolong your defeat. It\u2019s also maddening to play: Since you\u2019re trying to hold out from guessing the word of the day as long as possible, but luck might just lock you in to a bunch of red squares right at the beginning. I hate it. It\u2019s great.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "Of all the Wordle variations, only a few have stuck with me. I play original Wordle the most regularly. Dordle and Quordle are a nice addition to the routine. When I\u2019m bored, the larger multi-Wordles are fun, and it\u2019s really satisfying to tussle with the AI that runs Absurdle and back it into a corner. But when I just want a quick little game that will have me swearing at my phone, there\u2019s no better option than Antiwordle.\nI recommend that you try Antiwordle immediately after losing a regular Wordle game. Here, losing is the whole point. You\u2019re good at losing? Perfect.\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nYour goal is to avoid guessing the word for as long as possible.\nRed means the letter is in the right place (like a green in Wordle)\nYellow means the letter is in there somewhere (same as in Wordle)\nGray means the letter isn\u2019t in there, and you\u2019re not allowed to guess it anymore.\nWhat makes Antiwordle so hard is that you must play words that match what you learned in your previous guesses. Reds have to be in the same place. Yellows have to be in there somewhere.\nYes, the red and yellow letter rules are the same as \u201chard mode\u201d in regular Wordle (which you can access by clicking Wordle\u2019s settings gear). The gray letter rules make Antiwordle a lot harder: Once you\u2019ve guessed a gray letter, it\u2019s completely out of play. And you\u2019re still trying not to guess the word. It\u2019s harder than it sounds, because you quickly run out of options.\nHow to win at Antiwordle\nAntiwordle is strict about how you must play it, but vague about what it means to succeed. The goal isn\u2019t to not guess the word, but to avoid guessing it for as long as possible. There is no moment where you know you have won, only a moment where you know you have lost. The closest thing you can find to happiness in this game is a loss with a large number of guesses behind you.\nSince regular Wordle gives you six guesses, I think of an Antiwordle game as successful if it takes me more than six guesses to arrive at the answer. It\u2019s still hard; I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever hit double digits or not. This morning, I guessed it in nine, and felt like that was pretty good. I was mad the whole time.\nAnd that\u2019s because anytime you get a red letter, you\u2019re like fuck. And you never know when that letter is going to show up. You might be like \u201chahaha I\u2019ll start with GLYPH\u201d and get three reds. Good luck from there, bucko.\nSo, here is the closest I have come to a winning (losing) strategy:\nOnly guess one vowel in your starter and the first few words. There are only so many vowels and you know at least one must be in there, so don\u2019t spend them all at once.\nWhen you get a yellow, play it in the same place. You\u2019ll know that word won\u2019t be the solution.\nDouble up red/yellow letters if you dare. If it turns out there\u2019s only one of that letter, the second will appear in gray but they can\u2019t stop you from guessing it again. The initial guess is risky, though.\nDon\u2019t try to get smart and use all the rare letters at first. If you know the word has an E, that\u2019s no biggie, lots of words have an E. If you know it has an X, well, your pool of possibilities just got a lot smaller.\nI am torn on whether to try to guess the actual word while I\u2019m playing. Normally I try to keep my mind off it, lest it get stuck in my head and then I can\u2019t think of anything else. But knowing the actual word can also be an asset, so that I can make sure not to put a T in that final position, or whatever.\nAnd with that, I\u2019m out of helpful ideas. Just go give it a try, and see what happens. Good luck. You won\u2019t win.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "Wordle is still played the same way as ever, and if you just want a simple game without overthinking it, that\u2019s all you need to know. But things have been changing behind the scenes, and that includes the way solutions are chosen.\nOriginally, the answer each day came from a list of 2000+ words that was embedded in the site\u2019s javascript code. (If you wanted, you could just view the page\u2019s source and look at it.) This list avoided words that were too obscure or that were simple plurals of four-letter words, and over time I found myself developing a sense for whether a word I was mulling over is \u201cWordle-ish\u201d enough to be the solution for the day. Sometimes, before entering my guess, I would check it against this no-spoilers list: all the Wordle words are there, but not in order. I could Ctrl-F for, say, \u201cminim\u201d to see whether it\u2019s a possible solution.\nWhen the New York Times bought the game earlier this year, at first they kept the old word list. (All the complaints about the NYT making the game \u201charder\u201d were imagined; they actually did the opposite, removing the word AGORA from the word list because they thought it was a bit too obscure.)\nBut that\u2019s changing. There is now an editor for Wordle, Tracy Bennett, and the editor has the power to choose the solutions. That means you have to shift your solving spidey sense from \u201cis this the kind of word I would find on the Wordle list?\u201d to \u201cIs this the kind of word Tracy Bennett would pick for today?\u201d\nFor Thanksgiving, she picked FEAST. For the day before Thanksgiving, DRIVE. You might either think those are cute and clever choices, or you get mad that the purity of the game is being spoiled. I don\u2019t agree with the writer who said that the editor is \u201cruining\u201d Wordle, but I understand.\nIf you play the New York Times crossword, you know that playfulness is part of the philosophy; I\u2019m not at all surprised that these little winks are making their way over to Wordle choices. By choosing words deliberately each day, the NYT is also giving itself the ability to avoid words it thinks may be inappropriate, like when FETUS popped up after the Roe v. Wade opinion was leaked.\nUltimately, this means that you may want to keep seasonality and newsworthiness in mind when choosing your starting word, or when pondering a possible answer. FEAST may seem a bit heavy-handed, but what if it was meant as a message, loud and clear, that times have changed?\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "I like to think of myself as good at Wordle (caring about Wordle is one of my worst personality flaws and I\u2019m embracing it, thank you very much), so I was thrilled to see that the New York Times has a new tool called WordleBot that can grade your performance on any past Wordle.\nIf you\u2019ve played Wordle recently, you can visit the tool in the same browser and it\u2019ll know how you made your guesses\u2014but you can also upload a screenshot of a Wordle you have played in the past. I\u2019m going to introduce you to the bot with some older screenshots, but then we\u2019ll dive into strategy for today\u2019s puzzle, number 293, so either stop reading or go solve it now if you don\u2019t want to see spoilers.\nHow to use WordleBot\nFirst, solve today\u2019s puzzle, and then visit this link. It will guide you through the process. If you want an analysis of an older puzzle or somebody else\u2019s puzzle, take a screenshot. (After you solve a puzzle, the Wordle stats screen will pop up. Hit the \u201cx\u201d and then screenshot the grid. You can also go back to that page any time after solving, so long as the next puzzle isn\u2019t out yet, and it will remember your guesses.)\nThen, swipe through the result screens. The first one gives you an overall score for skill and for luck. The rest step through your guesses, and the bot compares what choices you made to what it would have done.\nHow good is WordleBot at Wordle?\nThe bot cheats, by the way. It calculates how well you\u2019re narrowing down the possibilities, but it knows which 2,309 words are in the official solutions list. The English language actually has more like 13,000 five-letter words; many were just excluded to make the game more interesting, like plurals of four-letter words that don\u2019t tend to be on there, for example. Some obscure words were also left out, as well as a bunch of words that I don\u2019t consider very obscure: FUTON will never be a solution, the bot told me, nor will PORKY, although both are allowed as guesses.\nOn the other hand, at least the bot doesn\u2019t know which puzzles have already been published. When I\u2019m playing, if one of the possibilities is SNOUT but I remember that SNOUT was the solution last week, I can mentally cross it off. The bot has not been given this guidance.\nHow to learn from WordleBot (spoilers ahead!)\nThe most exciting thing about WordleBot is not that it will tell you how skillful you are, but that it can give you tips to be better.\nToday\u2019s puzzle was on the easier side (I and two of my coworkers all solved it in three guesses.) The bot, smug bastard that it is, says it would have solved it in two. (It starts with CRANE.)\nI got an overall skill rating of 93. It liked my opener (STONE), and said my second guess of CHAMP cut the possibilities down to just two. My third guess, then, was lucky.\nI ran staff writer Sarah Showfety\u2019s solution through the bot next. It gave her an overall skill score of just 85, mainly because her second guess of SNARE only brought the solution pool down to three possibilities instead of two. Deputy editor Joel Cunningham got a skill score of 84, and in this case he seems to have been dinged for being too lucky. His opener brought the possible solutions to just 9, and after CLAMP he was down to just one. (We all beat the typical Wordle player, the bot says: The average skill score is 79.)\nJust for fun, I tried today\u2019s puzzle again in another browser and tried my best to play badly. (As we learned from my post about Antiwordle earlier this week, I may not actually be great at Wordle, but I am definitely bad at being bad at it.) It liked my starter, BOGUS, and my follow-up, PARSE. But after that, the little bot was just shaking its head at my bad guesses. I actually had it narrowed down to just four possibilities at that point. My next two, RAISE and SPARE, it said were \u201cwasted\u201d guesses that didn\u2019t add to what we already know. But that\u2019s not actually true: Both gave clues about the position of the letters that were previously yellow, and both included gray letters that I could eliminate as possibilities. I ended up with a skill score of just 22 though, solving the puzzle in five guesses, which fits.\nSo what did we learn? Among other things, we got our starters graded. CRANE is the bot\u2019s pick; it liked Joel\u2019s STERN and Sarah\u2019s ROUTE. All of these will on average narrow down the pool to somewhere between 90 to 100 possibilities. (That number can be higher or lower, though, depending on what the day\u2019s actual solution is. Sometimes you\u2019re just unlucky.)\nSo go ahead and ask the bot how it thinks you did. You might be mad about the answers, but you\u2019ll probably learn something.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

If you're addicted to Wordle and hate waiting for a new one then this is the place for you!\nThis isn't original at all I'm just experimenting and having fun :)\nYou can find the original Wordle here: https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/\nFeaturing some visual assets and sounds from: https://kenney.itch.io/\nFont: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?query=2p\nMade with: https://www.construct.net/\nIf you like this and want to support my work please buy one of my TTRPGs at https://wheelsrpgs.itch.io/\nIf you run into any bugs let me know in the comments, I'm pretty new to programming in general. I might make small updates here and there but this is a for fun project so don't expect massive amounts of support.\nDevelopment log\n- empty word bug fixJan 11, 2022\n- New word filterJan 10, 2022\nComments\nLog in with itch.io to leave a comment.\nIs ther any way to change the background or correct letter color?, my husband has vision problems and the yellow letters are impossible for him to see, it is a little easier if we get to level 2 but takes forever to do that! Great game\nPLEASE please please change the yellow/white combo. It is awful to read. :( I love everything else!\nJuker is a word. You should add it to your dictionary.\nI love Wheeldle! Thank you. I find it somewhat difficult, however, to see the white letters on the yellow background. My suggestion would be that in future iterations of the game, you use more contrasting colors for the correct letters in incorrect spaces. Again thanks for the enjoyment. Janie Campbell\nMy first word was paint does this mean im artistic?\nno\nwtf is an agave bruh\nagave is word. It was on wordle once L BOZO\nwhat\nSOARE is a word. Please add to your dictionary. Fun game otherwise. \ud83d\ude00\ndoes a streak save? I'm on like 12 and don't want to lose it when I log off\nSo many genuine words just not accepted - I give up. Today I have had 3 goes at finding word using all the vowels but still have a nil return - how can that be?\nThere are no words that only use the letters that I have left.\nwhat did it tell you the word was? o.o\nI quit the game when there weren\u2019t any possibilities. I didn\u2019t even think to put wrong words in to find out what word they wanted.\nbummer!\nYou could have tried cursing it, like in a cartoon: QXJGV\nHi. How many levels are there? Streak at 50, still at level 3...\nLevel 160, and still at level 3\nOmaigahdwottastreak! but how did you crack their weird dictionary?\nThere are endless levels.\nGreat game, thanks.\nBut encountered a 'no word' option several times, including today.\nAlso surprised how many common words are not accepted:\nMidge, Spall, Plebs, Lupin, Relet, Doric, Bling, Hunky, Rotas,....\nI'm baffled as to what dictionary doesn't contain actual words like morph, chink and mafic, but does contain an abbreviation like hippo.\nI just lost because of the non-word \"gotta.\" Yet trope was rejected as a word!\n\"Sicko\" is a word, for some reason...\nIf you fill in a line, hit enter, then tab... things stop working. It becomes unresponsive.\nAdding this because you asked for bugs.\nLove the game!\nCould you make a colourblind-friendly mode? The yellow and green are practically indistinguishable to me.\nI don't know what people are complaining about. It makes it clear that the game is just experimental. I\nlost at 6 to crepe using erupt as the last wor\nSO FAR, STEAK OF 5\nand crap, i left my caps on\nthis is like mastermind, come to think of it\nstruggled for ages - no wonder as \u2018kinda\u2019 is not a word.\nKinda is 100% a word https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oGDf1wjWp5RF_X9C7HoedhIWMh5uJs8s/view\nIt would be nice if you didn't lose your streak when you close the tab or browser.\nThanks for making this, though :)\nBrowser version crashes on button press.\nNo A, E, I, O, U, or Y? No idea, but I know how to spell \"bullsh't.\"\nBuggy... said there was no T, but the answer was THIEF\nThis terrible. I have guessed several words that are in the dictionary that the game says are not, and it is maddening that it won't reveal the answer if you get locked out because you entered something that \"isn't a word\".\nYou don't get locked out, just hit 'delete'. And it's not using the full scrabble dictionary, this is OK\nHi-I agree with others that it'd be nice to have a pause after succeeding (with a celebratory message) before the screen disappears and moves on to the next round. I don't need a screenshot of the game. But, the fun dopamine hit of that moment of celebration is a big reason for playing any game! It's kind of anticlimactic without that.\nYou have \"bronx\" in the dictionary which is a proper noun. You also have \"enrol\" which is a British English spelling, while most other words seem to be American English.\nfirst of all, i'm enjoying playing this. Congrats.\nBug: All my data is lost every time I stop playing, even for a short while.\nAlso, instead of going immediately to next word, I would love to have a screen to print and share my guesses, like in wordle.\nAlso,, the word was Kelly, but that's a name LOL . I tried jelly and belly but the word was a proper name Kelly\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\nTonight the game didnt accept the word Bundt...,, as in bundt cake ....I think that word should be added as it's a common five letter word ty!,:):)\nRemove Bronx from the dictionary if you won't include Paris or Italy. I am miffed that my streak was broken by this.\ni would agree. place names don't seem okay. just curious what dictionary the developer used to come up with words? perhaps a focus on the scrabble dictionary or something would be helpful here?\ni just tried 'feral' as an opening and it didn't recognize it as a word. is there a dictionary being used as the basis for the coding?\nit's fun. thanks for developing.\nwords not being recognized though (i've been trying to use them as starter words)\n- email\n- bling\ni will add as i come across others.\nvery fun game\ni play for hours on my phone\n:)\nFor some reasin it seems my Google Chrome doesn\u2019t support HTML 5 and I can\u2019t update it.\nAre you using an American or British English dictionary? I got 'favor' and 'rumor', and then 'lorry'\nHelp - give up - can\u2019t get started!\nNice game, but the white-on-yellow tiles are very hard to read for me. Black on yellow would be great!\nI've run into a bug where I'm stuck with 4 blank spaces with a letter after them. I can't backspace but it makes the type sound if I try to type. I can try to guess but it just says word not in dictionary.\nMy browser was also lagging quite a bit , don't know if that contributed."

      "text": "So far, all my favorite Wordle variations have kept the same shape of game board as the original: Five letters, each guess appearing as a new row in a grid. You can see what you guessed before, and you can see how many guesses you still have left. Waffle changes the game in interesting ways, and for that, it intrigues me.\nHow to play Waffle\nIn Waffle, you\u2019re solving six for words at once, but you don\u2019t have to guess the letters\u2014the letters are already there. You just have to put the letters in the right places. It looks like a crossword, but behaves more like a Rubik\u2019s cube: The only way to play is to swap squares from one place to another.\nThe green and yellow color coding works the same way as in Wordle: green means a letter is in the right place, yellow means the letter belongs somewhere else in the word. But thanks to the criss-cross grid, yellows at corners introduce ambiguity. Is the yellow letter in the vertical word or the horizontal word? It could be either, and you won\u2019t know until you make a swap.\nEvery puzzle can be solved in 10 swaps or fewer, or so the creator promises. You are given a budget of 15 swaps. Your score is the number of budgeted swaps you didn\u2019t use, so if it took you 11 turns, you get four stars. Five stars is the maximum. You\u2019ll also get a nifty grid to share on social media, with green squares for the letters you placed correctly. This way, you still have something to show even if you didn\u2019t fully solve the puzzle before time is up.\nHow to win at Waffle\nRemember, your swaps are limited. In some tile-swapping games, if you make a mistake, it\u2019s often not too much of a hit to your score to switch things back to where they were. If you get a 71 instead of a 70 in I Love Hue, who cares? Here, a bad swap takes you from 15 down to 14. If you choose to swap it back, you\u2019re down to 13. Budget carefully.\nDon\u2019t jump to conclusions when you see a yellow letter. Remember, if it\u2019s at a corner, the yellow could be a clue for one word or the other. You\u2019ll probably have a moment where you think \u201caha, it\u2019s in this horizontal word!\u201d before remembering it might actually be in the vertical word instead.\nFor this reason, the squares that don\u2019t have any intersections are strategically valuable. If a yellow isn\u2019t in an intersection, you know exactly which word it belongs in. (By contrast, I don\u2019t like to play crosswords that don\u2019t have intersections for every letter; that\u2019s just lazy puzzle-making.)\nOne twist you\u2019ll realize as you continue playing: After you swap a letter, you no longer have a visual record of where it used to be. I often solve Wordles with a pad of paper at my side, and that definitely helped here. But I also started taking screenshots along the way, so when I find myself thinking \u201cwhat letter was yellow in that top word a few turns ago?\u201d I check my camera roll to be sure.\nIs Waffle harder than Wordle?\nAll of this complaining is a preface to saying: I failed my first Waffle. By the time I figured out what all the words were, I had two swaps left, and needed three. This left me with a 0/5 score, no stars. My grid was all green except for two black blocks.\nOn my next try, I was more cautious. I hedged my bets on those corner yellows, and when I wanted to move a tile, I thought very carefully about what I wanted the other side of that swap to look like\u2014not just \u201clet\u2019s get rid of the N so we can put an A here,\u201d but \u201cthere are three A\u2019s in the puzzle, let\u2019s make the swap that puts the N in a useful place.\u201d\nOfficially, this makes Waffle harder than Wordle; I\u2019ve never lost a Wordle. (I\u2019m sure it will happen someday. I\u2019m smug, not cocky.) But I would bet that once you get the hang of it, Waffle is easier in some ways. All the letters are right in front of you, so you\u2019ll never be entirely surprised by a SQUAD or a FUZZY. Waffle is still new, so I\u2019ll need to play it a bunch more to form further opinions. For now, it\u2019s one of my favorite daily word games. Maybe it will be one of yours too.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "Etaoin shrdlu\nEtaoin shrdlu (/\u02c8\u025bti.\u0254\u026an \u02c8\u0283\u025c\u02d0rdlu\u02d0/,[1] /\u02c8e\u026at\u0251\u02d0n \u0283r\u0259d\u02c8lu\u02d0/)[2] is a nonsense phrase that sometimes appeared by accident in print in the days of hot type publishing, resulting from a custom of type-casting machine operators filling out and discarding lines of type when an error was made. It appeared often enough to become part of newspaper lore \u2013 a documentary about the last issue of The New York Times composed using hot metal (July 2, 1978) was titled Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu.[3] The phrase etaoin shrdlu is listed in the Oxford English Dictionary and in the Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.\nThe letters in the string are, approximately, the twelve most commonly used letters in the English language; differing sources do give slightly different results but one well-known sequence is ETAOINS RHLDCUM, ordered by their frequency.[4]\nHistory\n[edit]The letters on type-casting machine keyboards (such as Linotype and Intertype) were arranged by descending letter frequency to speed up the mechanical operation of the machine, so lower-case e-t-a-o-i-n\nand s-h-r-d-l-u\nwere the first two columns on the left side of the keyboard.\nEach key would cause a brass matrix (an individual letter mold) from the corresponding slot in a font magazine to drop and be added to a line mold. After a line had been cast, the constituent matrices of its mold were returned to the font magazine.\nIf a mistake was made, the line could theoretically be corrected by hand in the assembler area. However, manipulating the matrices by hand within the partially assembled line was time-consuming and presented the chance of disturbing important adjustments. It was much quicker to fill out the bad line and discard the resulting line of text than it was to redo it properly.\nTo make the line long enough to proceed through the machine, operators would finish it by running a finger down the first columns of the keyboard, which created a pattern that could be easily noticed by proofreaders. Occasionally such a line would be overlooked and make its way into print.\nAppearances outside typography\n[edit]The phrase has gained enough notability to appear outside typography, including:\nComputing\n[edit]- SHRDLU was used in 1972 by Terry Winograd as the name for an early artificial-intelligence system in Lisp.[5]\n- The ETAOIN SHRDLU Chess Program was written by Garth Courtois, Jr. for the Nova 1200 mini-computer, competing in the 6th and 7th ACM North American Computer Chess Championship 1975 and 1976.[6]\n- Etienne Shrdlu was used as the name of a character in Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, touch-typing training software from the late 1980s.[7]\nMedia\n[edit]- Variations of etaoin shrdlu are used as character names in many works, including Elmer Rice's 1923 play The Adding Machine,[8] Thomas Pynchon's early short story The Secret Integration (1962), Max Shulman's 1944 book Barefoot Boy with Cheek,[9] Charles G. Finney's 1935 The Circus of Dr. Lao,[10] and The Black Hole Travel Agency novels by Jack McKinney.\n- Variations of etaoin shrdlu are used in the titles of some works, including \"Etaoin Shrdlu\", a 1942 short story by Fredric Brown about a sentient Linotype machine (a sequel, \"Son of Etaoin Shrdlu\", was written by others in 1981);[8] the 1945 whimsical short story \"Etaoin and Shrdlu\" by Anthony Armstrong which ends \"And Sir Etaoin and Shrdlu married and lived so happily ever after that whenever you come across Etaoin's name even today it's generally followed by Shrdlu's\";[8] a 50-year history of the National Press Club (USA) published in 1958 titled Shrdlu \u2013 An Affectionate Chronicle;[11] and The Best of Shrdlu, a collection by Denys Parsons of humorous misprints and double meanings from newspapers that Parsons ascribed to a mischievous character named Gobfrey Shrdlu, referring to collectors of them as Shrdlologists.[12]\n- Three pieces in The New Yorker magazine were published in 1925 under the pen name Etain Shrdlu.[13] At least one piece in The New Yorker magazine had Etaoin Shrdlu in the title.[14]\n- Douglas R. Hofstadter's G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid includes a chapter titled \"SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing\", which features a character named Eta Oin using a computer program SHRDLU \u2013 a reference to Terry Winograd's program and Bach's \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\".\n- Etaoin Shrdlu is the name of a character in at least two Robert Crumb comic stories, including Weirdo.[15]\n- \"Eotain\" and \"Shurdlu\", using these spellings, are the names of two characters who make sporadic joint appearances in Phil Foglio's webcomic Girl Genius.\n- Etaoin and Shrdlu both appear frequently in the drawings of Emile Mercier as place names, racehorses' names, and people's names.\n- The French equivalent, Elaoin Sdr\u00e9tu, appears in Andr\u00e9 Franquins \"No\u00ebl et l\u2019Elaoin\" (1978).\n- The rogue-like video game NetHack uses randomized names for unidentified magic scrolls; one of these names is ETAOIN SHRDLU.[16]\n- \"Molten Fairies: Sprites of a Newspaper\", featuring Etaoin, Shrdlu, and Cmfwyp, appeared in Perth's \"The Daily News\" in 1922.[17]\n- James Schmitz uses the sequence as a swear word in several of his pieces.\nMusic\n[edit]- Shrdlu (Norman Shrdlu) is listed as the composer of \"Jam Blues\", cut 1 on the 1951 Norman Granz\u2013produced jazz album released in 1990 as Charlie Parker Jam Session. This appears to be a joke on Granz's part as Norman Shrdlu is credited in several Parker (and other) tunes that are jam sessions rather than compositions.\n- \"Etaoin Shrdlu\" is the title of the first song on Cul de Sac's 1999 album Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall.\n- \"Etaoin\"[18] and \"Shrdlu\", written and performed by Dallas Roberts, are original musical pieces created for the soundtrack of the U.S. television series House of Cards, Season 2, Episode 10.[19]\nSee also\n[edit]- Filler text\n- Dord, a ghost word that appeared in the second edition of the Merriam-Webster New International Dictionary\n- Lorem ipsum\n- Qwerty\n- Dvorak keyboard layout\n- Azertyuiop (horse), whose name derives from letters on the top row of French keyboard layout\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"etaoin shrdlu\".

      "text": "Every time I think we\u2019ve seen the last twist on Wordle, there comes another game that manipulates a variable I didn\u2019t even realize was missing. In this case, the new element is competition. Oh, and speed.\nIn Squabble, you play a Wordle-esque game against others in real time. The setup is the same as always: green means a letter is in the right place, yellow means it\u2019s elsewhere in the word. Your guesses must all be dictionary words, and you only get six of them.\nWhat makes this interesting is the presence of an HP bar. If you\u2019re familiar with role-playing games that give you a health meter during battles, it\u2019s the same idea: You start out with 100 hit points and you lose one point each second. While my first thought was, oh no I\u2019m taking damage just by sitting here! I was able to calm down by remembering that I can just think of it as a 100-second timer.\nBut that\u2019s not all, of course. When you guess correctly, earning green squares, you gain health. And when your opponents guess correctly, they deal damage to you. If everybody is sitting there stumped, you\u2019ll all see your health meters ticking down in unison, but as soon as somebody makes a correct guess, their health goes up and yours goes down.\nIn Squabble, it doesn\u2019t matter if you run out of guesses on your board. If you still have HP, you\u2019re still in the game, and you move on to the next word. You win by being the last one standing.\nYou can play in a \u201cbattle royale\u201d game with up to 99 players, or you can take part in a \u201cblitz\u201d game with five or fewer. Just click \u201cfind game\u201d and wait for others to join, or share a lobby code if you want to play with a friend. I found that it takes a long time for the waiting room to fill up enough for a proper battle royale, but if you have a bunch of buddies who want to play with you, you could set up a decent-sized game by sharing the code.\nAnd then, try to beat them. The words in Squabble are tougher than in vanilla Wordle; I got gems like LIBER (a book of records) and MUREX (a type of snail). If you lose, you can choose to stay online as a spectator, and the game will let you know at the end which words you missed.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "Even in 2025, some of us just can't get enough of Wordle. Within seconds of finishing his first Wordle game, my 12-year-old son opened a new tab and googled \u201cinfinite Wordle.\u201d (He found Wheeldle, still one of my favorites after all these years.) What\u2019s better, though, is playing multiple Wordle-style puzzles at the same time. Here's where Quordle and the others come in, and I'll talk about how they compare to the original.\nAs we all know by now, in Wordle, you have six chances to guess a five-letter word. Green squares mean a guessed letter is correct; yellow means that letter is in the word but not in that position. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole game. The original Wordle game is part of the New York Times' stable of games, and we provide hints for each day's Wordle puzzle here.\nBut why play just one game, guessing one five-letter word, when you can do multiple puzzles in parallel? Soon after Wordle came Dordle, where each of your guesses is applied to two different Wordle-style puzzles at once. (You get seven guesses instead of six.) Then of course there is Quordle with four puzzles (you get nine guesses), and it goes on from there: Octordle with eight puzzles (13 guesses), Sedecordle with 16 (21 guesses), and Duotrigordle with 32 (37 guesses).\nOf all of them, I feel Quordle is the sweet spot: enough puzzles to make things interesting, but not so many as to be overwhelming. The Lifehacker team feels the same way, as it's the only multi-Wordle for which we publish daily hints.\nHow do you win at games like Quordle?\nFortunately if you're new, Quordle and its kin all feature a practice mode that you can play as many times as you like, alongside the daily puzzle that you can only play once each day. (The daily puzzle's solution is the same for everyone.) So feel free to hit the practice button and start learning the ropes through experience.\nBut I can give you a few tips on strategy. No matter how many puzzles you\u2019re solving at a time, I like to think of guesses as answering one (or more) of three questions:\nWhat letters are in the solution?\nI know some yellows; where are they in the solution?\nIs the word I'm guessing the solution?\nIt\u2019s a mistake to play the game with #3 as your only strategy. Pretty quickly you\u2019ll discover exploratory guesses are important, and you\u2019ll pick starter words that answer question #1 efficiently. (My mnemonic: ETAOIN SHRDLU, pronounced \u201cEdwin Shirdloo\u201d as if it were a name, is a list of the arguably most common letters in English. My starters always use letters from this list.)\nSimultaneous Wordles require lots of #1 and #2 guesses. You need to constantly ask yourself: what information can I gather with this guess? The same guess can do double duty for different puzzles at the same time: maybe you combine a yellow from one word (#2) with some brand-new letters (#1) and a yellow from another word (#2 again).\nYou definitely don\u2019t want to do a #3 guess until you\u2019re pretty sure of the answer, since your attempted solution on one puzzle is a guess that will probably be useless for the other(s).\nHow to solve four Wordle puzzles at once\nAlright, let\u2019s look at this in action. The puzzle I\u2019m solving (shown in the image up top) is a \u201cpractice\u201d puzzle, so you don\u2019t have to worry about spoilers.\nWe start with TRASH, and get hits on three of the puzzles. Next up, to start making progress on the upper right puzzle, I choose a word that uses common letters but doesn\u2019t repeat any of the ones we just tried: CLINK.\nStill only one yellow in that upper right puzzle, but we\u2019re in a really good position now on the bottom two puzzles, which now each have four letters confirmed\u2014some of them are even greens. Three on the top left isn\u2019t shabby either. As we put together future guesses (#2's and #3's for the puzzles where we\u2019re close), let\u2019s keep feeding in new letters (#1) to help with the top right.\nWe can probably solve one already: the lower left has to be CHAS_, giving us either CHASE or CHASM. I get cocky and go with CHASE, which is wrong, but at least gets an E into play. So then I solve with CHASM, and then I see what I\u2019ve learned from introducing that E.\nThe lower right is _ _ A_E with an S, a T, and a K in there somewhere, so it\u2019s either STAKE or SKATE. Rather than use one of those as my next pick, I want to knock out a couple possibilities. I still don\u2019t know where that L goes in the top right puzzle, and I\u2019d like to get another unknown letter or two into the mix. It also wouldn\u2019t hurt to stick an A in there somewhere to help us out on the top left, where we know there\u2019s an A but we don\u2019t know where.\nI settle on ATOLL, which gives valuable clues for all three. We now know that the top right puzzle has an O, and we know several places that the L cannot be. We know that the top left must be either _AIS_ or _ _ISA, and my gut is saying DAISY. We have also confirmed that the lower right must be SKATE and not STAKE.\nSo I guess SKATE and then DAISY, which reveals a Y at the end of the top right puzzle. We don\u2019t have many letters to go on, but the fact that we\u2019ve guessed so many, with so few hits, suggests there might be at least one double letter. It can\u2019t be a double L, since there are no Ls in the second and fourth spots, so I consider doubling up a letter I haven\u2019t guessed yet. What could fit in LO_ _Y? All I can think of is LOBBY\u2014yup, that\u2019s it. Four puzzles solved in eight guesses, with one to spare. The little squares won\u2019t necessarily fit in a tweet, so you also get a little shareable graphic that looks like this:\nThe same strategy applies no matter how many puzzles you're solving. On the bigger grids, make sure to scroll around so you don't forget about one at the bottom of the page. I actually find Quordle easier than Wordle, in some ways, because every guess has four times the chances of turning up some useful information. Give it a try and see how you fare!\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "The internet loves two things: A fresh trend, and word games. Wordle is both, and even has a love story in the mix. On Sunday, the second day of 2022, the online word game went viral and was played by more than 300,000 people.\nIt started out as a word guessing game created by Jost Wardle, a software engineer based in Brooklyn, for his partner who loves word games. Since then, you\u2019ve likely seen people tweeting blocks of grey, green, and yellow. If you waant to be a part of the fun, here\u2019s how Wordle works.\nHow to play (and share) Wordle\nWordle is a once-a-day puzzle game that lives on a simple, ad-free website. It starts you off with six blank rows of five boxes each. The game doesn\u2019t give you any letters to start off with, and your goal is to completely guess the word before your six guesses are up.\nAfter you guess a word (and it has to be a real word, not random letters), the letters will turn into either grey, yellow, or green.\nGrey means that the letter is not in the word at all.\nYellow means the letter is in the word, just not where you guessed it.\nGreen means that the letter is in the exact place where you guessed it.\nOnce you understand the rules, it\u2019s simply a game of elimination. Start off with a word, and just see if you can get yellow or green tiles (if you\u2019re new to word games, we\u2019ve got a hack for you below).\nOnce you\u2019ve guessed the word, you\u2019ll see a popup with your streak, scores, and a countdown for the next Wordle. You can click \u201cShare\u201d to copy your score in visual emojis, paste it in a tweet, and send it along. Then you\u2019re addicted and come back to try it out each day.\nHow to master Wordle, even if you suck at word games\nIf, like me, you suck at word games, here\u2019s some good news: Wordle has quite a range. Word game lovers can get competitive with it, but if you\u2019re a beginner, there are a couple of tricks you can use to guess the word correctly by the third or fourth try.\nThe great thing here is that you\u2019re limited to only guessing five-letter words, so your best strategy is to guess words using the most common letters in the English alphabet. Try words that include the letters e, t, a, i, o, n, s, h, and r. And, most commonly, words start with the letters t, a, o, d, and w.\nHere are some suggestions for words you should start out with: siren, octal, abuse, and so on. Here\u2019s a list of the world\u2019s most common five-letter words.\nAfter your first or second try with this, you\u2019ll probably get two or three yellow or green tries. You\u2019ll also know which letters not to include.\nThen you can start off the elimination process on your own. You can obviously use Google (for my puzzle, I searched \u201cfive-letter words containing \u2018nal\u2019,\u201d or you can rely on a wonderful site like Word Hippo.\nHere, you can filter words that contain certain letters, and you can even use the advanced filters to define letters in the beginning, middle, or end of the words. Using this list, you\u2019ll find the right word in no time. Once you do it a couple of times, you\u2019ll have the confidence to solve Wordle without any help.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."
