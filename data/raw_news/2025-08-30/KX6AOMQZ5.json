  "description": "For millions of Americans, the biggest threat to their personal finances and spending routines isn\u2019t tariffs. It\u2019s their mortgages. Many homebuyers jumped",
  "content": "Younger homeowners and those with less financial cushion are most at risk \u2014 and many are already scaling back household spending.\n\nFor millions of Americans, the biggest threat to their personal finances and spending routines isn\u2019t tariffs. It\u2019s their mortgages.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nMany homebuyers jumped at the chance to take out an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) when interest rates began spiking in early 2022.\n\nARMs are attractive when rates rise because they start with a lower \u201cteaser\u201d rate that varies periodically after the first three to 10 years, with subsequent adjustments reflecting current market conditions. Buyers can land a bargain on their initial rate or trade up to a bit more house than they could afford with a traditional fixed mortgage. The median borrowing amount for ARMs is more than $40,000 larger compared to regular mortgages, data from the St. Louis branch of the Federal Reserve shows.\n\nSome homeowners with 30-year ARMs thought they were getting a discount on the American dream.\n\nIt\u2019s not turning out that way.\n\nARM adjustments can be upward or downward, depending on the market, and with interest rates still high, many homeowners now owe meaningfully more in monthly payments for their houses, condos or apartments. The resets are slicing into homeowners\u2019 personal balance sheets just as the Trump administration\u2019s global tariffs start to seep into consumer prices, prompting more ARM holders to turn to buy now, pay later and other alternative budgeting tools to manage their monthly expenses. Mortgage payments typically eat up around 30% of a household\u2019s income, the St. Louis Fed branch says. The more spent on your home, the less for essential and discretionary purchases.\n\nIt all means that the price tag of the American dream now comes with fine print: Home ownership can push you into spending all your monthly income as soon as it comes in the door. Consumers can find themselves in that paycheck-to-paycheck reality either by necessity \u2014 they don\u2019t earn enough income for non-essential purchases \u2014 or by choice \u2014 they have good income and meet their monthly basic but opt to spend what\u2019s left over on nice-to-haves. Either way, ARM resets make the affordability of daily life more difficult.\n\nA recent PYMNTS Intelligence report found that nearly four in 10 ARM holders have recently delayed or canceled a major purchase, versus 31% of fixed rate mortgage holders. Some 42% have cut back on non-essential spending, more than 37% of fixed-rate holders. Nearly one in two (46%) are using credit cards to cover basic purchases, versus 40% of those with fixed-rate loans. The signal: ARMs can put consumers in a slow-motion financial squeeze \u2014 and it\u2019s starting to tighten.\n\nHomebuyers who take out ARMs are betting that higher, fixed rates on traditional 30-year mortgages are a temporary blip, that lower rates on those mainstay loans will last, or that that they\u2019ll sell their house before the first adjustment sets in. For the first two scenarios, the wager is that when an ARM\u2019s initial rate resets, the broader market will either have rebalanced to lower rates or have consistently been there. That\u2019s not happening.\n\nTake a five-year ARM, the most common type of adjustable mortgage, with a rate of 2.91% in August 2020. It\u2019s now adjusting according to the index it\u2019s tied to, the most common being the secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR. That index\u2019s rate is now 4.39%. A homeowner with a $400,000 mortgage will see their monthly payment rise this month to $2,001 from $1,667, a $334 increase, according to Zillow\u2019s mortgage calculator. The figures don\u2019t include property taxes or insurance.\n\nSome people with 3/1 ARMs are faring worse. Historical data on those mortgages is scarce \u2014 Freddie Mac and the Fed stopped tracking 3/1 rates in 2022 due to insufficient data from lenders \u2014 but the loans typically have rates below those of 5/1 ARMs.\n\nAssume our same homeowner as above took out a 3/1 ARM at 2.5% in January 2022. That seemed smart at the time \u2014 it was on the eve of the Fed\u2019s first of 11 consecutive interest rates hikes in March, intended to combat the steepest inflation in four decades following a flood of post-COVID money into the economy. But last January, the loan adjusted to 4.32%. The homeowner\u2019s monthly payments shot up to $1,984 from $1,580, over $400 more. The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.72% as of end-July, making refinancing an ARM expensive. The industry likes to say, \u201cmarry the house, date the rate,\u201d but the honeymoon for now is over.\n\nWorse may be yet to come. ARMs come with rate increase \u201ccaps\u201d \u2014 a typical 5/1 limits the first rate adjustment to five percentage points above the initial rate, later adjustments to two percentage points above the previous rate, and a lifetime cap of 5% on the initial rate.\n\nBut the sticker shock over time can be severe. For example, a $400,000 mortgage at 3% is $1,686 a month, not including insurance and taxes, mortgagecalculator.org shows. At the lifetime cap of 8%, it\u2019s $2,935 \u2014 over $1,200 more. The real inflation threat may not be in groceries or gas \u2014 it\u2019s in mortgages that haven\u2019t adjusted yet.\n\nBy November 2022, as the Fed continued to raise rates following its first increase in March, 12% of all mortgages were ARMs, compared to just over 3% a year prior, data from the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Urban Institute shows.\n\nBy one estimate, the ARMs race has since pulled back, and the mortgages now account for just over 8% of all residential loans applications, equal to one in 12 borrowers. Data on ARMs is notoriously variable; if there are now just over 51 million residential mortgages of all types outstanding, according to U.S. federal housing agency data, perhaps four million American have ARMs.\n\nThe Urban Institute says today\u2019s ARMs are nothing like those pre-dating the 2007-08 financial crisis and that they helped open homeownership to more people amid booming property prices. In June 2022, the rate on a fixed 30-year home loan spiked to an average 5.81%, topping out at 7.79% by November 2023, Freddie Mac shows a 5/1 ARM in November 2023 hovered around a more affordable 7%. ARMs are popular with younger, higher-income households that can more easily absorb a rate increase, the St. Louis Fed branch says. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a homeowner\u2019s spending patterns can stay the same.\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence data shows that living paycheck to paycheck is not just the purview of lower-income consumers. It also encompasses millions of middle- and upper-income Americans.\n\nIf ARMS were initially a financial life raft that allows homebuyers to get in on the American dream for less, that raft now looks less sea-worthy.\n\nRelief isn\u2019t in sight any time soon. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom President Donald Trump is pressuring to cut interest rates, said on Wednesday (July 30) that tariffs \u201chave begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen.\u201d Inflation \u2014 and its impact on rates \u2014 could be \u201cshort-lived\u201d or its effects \u201cmore persistent,\u201d he added \u2014 meaning that ARM holders might not find joy the next time their mortgages adjust.\n\nPocketbook pressure is coming from other sides as well.\n\nThe Trump administration restarted collections on student loans in May; defaults on the loans could slash consumer spending by $63 billion by dinging credit scores, closing off access to new credit and reducing disposable income through wage garnishments, Bloomberg reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the consumer price increases many economists have been looking out for after companies stockpiled goods in anticipation of tariffs are starting to show up. Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, the maker of products like Tide detergent and Pampers, said July 29 it would raise prices \u201cin the single digits\u201d on a quarter of its goods. Nearly half of U.S. consumers expect price increases to be double the rate of inflation, currently 2.7% \u2014 a sentiment that economists know can become self-fulfilling.\n\nTo find extra cash, Americans are pulling money out of their 401(k)s in record numbers, investment giant Vanguard said in June, with 4.8% taking a hardship distribution to plug financial emergencies last year, more than double the rate during the pandemic. But non-hardship withdrawals have also risen to 4.5% of account holders, up from 4% last year and during the height of the pandemic in 2021.\n\nThe Adjustable Rate Reckoning: How Home Ownership is Pushing Millions Paycheck to Paycheck\n\nRising Mortgage Costs Push Affluent Families to the Financial Edge\n\nConsumers Say They Want Budgeting But Aren\u2019t Using Them",

      "text": "Rising student loan defaults could reduce consumer spending by as much as $63 billion a year, according to Bloomberg Economics.\nAfter five years of there being no \u201cinvoluntary collections\u201d on defaulted loans, the U.S. Department of Education is set to restart collections and return the student loan system to where it was before the pandemic, Bloomberg reported Friday (May 2).\nThis will mark the first time some younger student loan borrowers have been required to make payments, and it will end some other student loan borrowers\u2019 hopes that the debt would be forgiven, according to the report.\nPayments were paused in March 2020, and delinquent borrowers were not reported to credit agencies until October, per the report.\nBeth Akers, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said in the report of the borrowers: \u201cThey\u2019re facing this jarring news \u2014 that their loans, which had no consequences tied to them for five years, suddenly have very big consequences.\u201d\nThe Department of Education announced April 21 that its Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) will resume federal student loan collections on Monday (May 5).\nThe department said in a press release that 42.7 million borrowers owe more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, more than five million have not made a monthly payment in over 360 days and sit in default, and four million are in late-stage delinquency of 91-180 days.\nIn a few months, almost 10 million borrowers \u2014 making up almost 25% of the federal student loan portfolio \u2014 could be in default, the release said.\nCurrently, only 38% of borrowers are in repayment and current on their student loans, per the release.\n\u201cThe Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe away debt, nor do the loan balances simply disappear,\u201d Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the release. \u201cHundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers. Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook.\u201d"

      "text": "As mortgage interest rates rise, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) become more popular, and they now make up 12.0 percent of total production, up from 3.3 percent in November 2021.\nThis development has alarmed many housing market observers who, informed by their experiences with subprime mortgages from 2005 to 2008, worry ARMs are risky and that future mortgage payments could become unsustainable for borrowers as rates rise.\nAre they right to be concerned? Not according to the research, which shows today\u2019s ARMs are no riskier than other mortgage products and that their lower monthly payments could increase access to homeownership for more potential buyers.\nWhat a borrower should know about ARMs\nARMs predate the last housing bubble. Among mortgages originated from 1995 to 2004, the average ARM share was 18.3 percent. What is atypical is the very low ARM share, by historical standards, from 2010 to 2021, driven in part by ultra-low interest rates during this period.\nBefore 2005, lenders held ARM borrowers to higher lending standards than borrowers who took out fixed-rate mortgages, requiring higher credit scores, higher incomes, and larger down payments to compensate for the higher risk. Borrowers understood how their mortgages worked, and there were no market hiccups.\nCompared with homeownership rates in other developed countries, the US rate is slightly below average. And for most developed countries, ARMs are the go-to mortgage product; only the US and Denmark offer 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.\nARMs generally have interest rates lower than the 30-year fixed-rate product. Mortgage rate attractiveness is measured by the difference between the current mortgage rate and the average 30-year mortgage rate over the preceding three years. When rates are attractive, this difference trends negative; when rates are less attractive, the difference trends positive.\nWhen mortgage rates are attractive, the ARM share is low, because borrowers want to lock in their rates for 30 years. When rates are less attractive, ARMs allow borrowers to save money given the lower rates, and the borrower can refinance if rates drop. Of course, if rates keep rising, ARM monthly payments will rise over time.\nToday\u2019s ARMs are not crisis-era ARMs\nThe risks of ARMs were substantially mitigated by the regulatory reforms put in place after the 2008 bust. Today\u2019s ARMs are not the risky products of 2008 or even the prebubble version. Instead, they are fully amortizing mortgages with initial fixed terms of 5, 7, or 10 years and are subject to an interest rate reset each year thereafter. (ARMs are usually referred to as 5/1, 7/1, and 10/1, depending on the length of the initial reset period.)\nOur calculations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac data from 2020 to 2022 indicate 19.5 percent of ARM originations have an initial fixed term of 5 years, 47.8 percent have a fixed term of 7 years, and 32.7 percent have a fixed term of 10 years. These mortgages reset annually after the fixed period ends.\nThis contrasts sharply with the 2005 to 2007 subprime ARMs, which generally had fixed terms of two or three years, and the rate for that initial period was often \u201cteased\u201d down; it also contrasts with the so-called negative amortization product, where the initial payments did not cover the full principal and interest payments on the loan and the loan balance was permitted to grow. It was this layering of risk\u2014 where risky products are provided to less-creditworthy borrowers, often without income verification\u2014that set borrowers up for failure.\nIn comparison, the risk profile of today\u2019s ARMs, like that of prebubble ARMs, is stronger than that of fixed-rate mortgages. The most recent data show ARM borrowers have higher FICO scores and lower loan-to-value ratios and are more affluent, as measured by their higher home values and larger loan balances. And borrowers taking out ARMs during this period received mortgage rates 0.58 percent lower, on average, than the fixed 30-year rate.\nCredit Characteristics of New Government-Sponsored Enterprise Borrowers\nARMs versus Fixed-Rate Mortgages\n| FICO | LTV ratio | Loan amount | Home value | Rate | ||\n| June\u2013August 2022 | ARM | 762 | 75 | $354,500 | $498,641 | 4.92 |\n| Fixed | 753 | 80 | $283,333 | $383,199 | 5.50 |\nSource: Urban Institute calculations of eMBS data.\nNotes: ARM = adjustable-rate mortgage. LTV = loan-to-value.\nToday\u2019s ARMs also contrast with the so-called 1/1 and 3/1 ARMs of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for which payments were fixed for an initial period of just one or three years. After the financial crisis, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau implemented an ability-to-repay rule, essentially requiring that mortgages be fully amortizing and that the lender qualify the borrower at the highest rate they could experience in the first five years. The result: very few ARMs have a reset period shorter than five years.\nFinally, ARMs tend to have caps at the reset. For example, today\u2019s government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) ARMs, 5/1s have a maximum increase at the first reset of 2 percent, and 7/1s and 10/1s have a maximum increase at the first reset of 5 percent. For subsequent resets, the usual adjustment is a maximum of 1 percent. And most ARMs have a 5 percent lifetime cap\u2014the rate cannot increase by more than 5 percent over the life of the loan. The reset caps are more meaningful the longer the initial period.\nShould more borrowers take advantage of ARMs?\nARMs offer considerable interest rate savings, even with today\u2019s inverted yield curve, in which shorter-term rates are higher than longer-term rates. On November 3, the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.95 percent and the rate on a 5/1 ARM was 5.95 percent, a 100 basis-point differential. And this is typical: in 2022, the differential has averaged 109 basis points.\nConsider the savings on a $375,000 loan (close to the 2022 GSE average): For a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.95 percent, the monthly payment is $1,820. For a 5/1 ARM at 5.95 percent, the monthly payment is $1,640\u2014nearly 10 percent less.\nThe ARM saves the borrower $2,160 per year\u2014almost $11,000 over the five-year initial reset period. Even if the borrower doesn\u2019t have an opportunity to refinance and the rate resets up, the borrower\u2019s income would likely be higher after five years, which could help keep payments manageable.\nMany borrowers buy a home anticipating to keep it for fewer than 10 years. For these borrowers, ARMs are highly economical when rates are higher. Even for those planning a longer holding period, an ARM allows for lower payments during the fixed period and preserves the option to refinance. This could help more renters transition to homeownership and access all the financial security and wealth-building benefits it provides.\nARMs are no longer something to fear\u2014in fact, they could help borrowers save money and reduce barriers to homeownership.\nLet\u2019s build a future where everyone, everywhere has the opportunity and power to thrive\nUrban is more determined than ever to partner with changemakers to unlock opportunities that give people across the country a fair shot at reaching their fullest potential. Invest in Urban to power this type of work."

      "text": "For decades, homeownership has stood as the bedrock of the American dream \u2014 a symbol of prosperity, stability, and upward mobility. But for millions of U.S. households in 2025, that dream is rapidly transforming into a source of financial fragility.\nData from the latest PYMNTS Intelligence in the July 2025 New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report, \u201cThe Adjustable-Rate Reckoning: How Homeownership Is Pushing Millions Paycheck to Paycheck,\u201d reveals that a confluence of rising home prices, sticky inflation and the delayed impact of interest rate hikes has turned a growing share of homeowners into paycheck-to-paycheck survivors.\nAt the heart of this reckoning is a significant shift in borrowing behavior. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), once a niche product with a checkered past, are gaining renewed relevance in a high-rate environment. But as these loans reset, homeowners are grappling with a new financial reality: one where housing, once a source of equity, becomes a destabilizing liability.\nAccording to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, more than 24 million Americans living paycheck to paycheck attribute their precarious financial state to the costs of homeownership \u2014 particularly mortgage burdens.\nWhy the American Dream Is Getting More Expensive\nSince March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates from near zero to a 23-year high, seeking to tame inflation. While much of the immediate impact was felt in business and capital markets, mortgage borrowers \u2014 especially those with ARMs \u2014 are now experiencing the lagged effects.\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence data, homeowners with ARMs are disproportionately burdened. Nearly 80% of those living paycheck to paycheck have increased credit card usage in recent months to manage rising mortgage payments. These borrowers are also more likely than their fixed-rate counterparts to defer large purchases or cut back on discretionary spending.\nThis behavior isn\u2019t isolated. It signals a broader tightening of consumer liquidity across the middle and upper-middle class, even among households that traditionally maintained financial buffers. The PYMNTS Intelligence report underscores that high income is no longer a reliable proxy for financial stability. In fact, over one-third of ARM borrowers making more than $100,000 annually now report living paycheck to paycheck.\nAfter all, to afford a median-priced home in 2025, a household requires an annual income of $116,986 \u2014 up 50% from five years ago. The median home price is now exceeding $416,900, up 100% since the financial crisis.\nThis disconnect between home prices and wage growth \u2014 average household income grew just 1.3% between 2020 and 2023 \u2014 means that an increasing number of buyers are stretching themselves thin to enter the market. The decision to own is no longer a straightforward investment play.\nRead the report: The Adjustable-Rate Reckoning: How Homeownership Is Pushing Millions Paycheck to Paycheck\nThe most revealing aspect of the study is not the existence of financial hardship, but its demographic breadth. Living paycheck to paycheck is no longer a symptom of low income. It now encompasses millions of middle- and upper-income Americans.\nNotably, among paycheck-to-paycheck consumers with mortgages, 31% say it\u2019s entirely due to homeownership costs, while 36% cite a mix of factors. This bifurcation is critical for banks, retailers and policymakers: a one-size-fits-all solution won\u2019t suffice.\nIn this environment, tools like BNPL are not just convenience products\u2014they are financial infrastructure. Among homeowners with mortgages, 1 in 5 reported using BNPL services in the past six months, more than renters or outright owners. For choice-driven consumers, BNPL is a way to manage cash flow without paying interest. For necessity-driven users, it may be a last resort.\nThe rise of consumer-grade financial engineering poses both opportunities and risks for providers. FinTech lenders and embedded finance platforms are uniquely positioned to serve this demand. However, underwriting quality and default exposure remain concerns as credit usage climbs.\nTraditional banks, meanwhile, are rethinking product strategies. The line between secured and unsecured debt is blurring. Mortgage holders using credit cards or BNPL to cover household costs are indirectly leveraging their homes for cash flow \u2014 without the formal structure of a HELOC or refinance."

      "text": "Homeownership has been a cornerstone of the American Dream ever since the New Deal introduced the 30-year mortgage following the Great Depression. What\u2019s new is how that widely held aspiration increasingly comes with strings. Property prices vary wildly by region and zip code, of course, but the toughest housing market in more than a generation means the average home went for $416,900 in the first quarter of this year. This price tag is more than double the amount in early 2009 following the subprime mortgage crisis.\nNeedless to say, the rise in most people\u2019s household incomes hasn\u2019t kept up with real estate\u2019s vertiginous run-up. The steep price tag means that a larger share of a typical homeowner\u2019s income now goes to the mortgage for their house, apartment or condo. Bankrate estimates that the average U.S. homebuyer now needs an annual household income of $116,986 to afford the typical property. This is nearly 50% more than just five years ago. Meanwhile, average household income rose just 1.3% from 2020 to 2023, according to the most recent data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s St. Louis branch. Inflation has also cut into pocketbooks. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows you need $191 today to buy what $100 bought in January 2025.\nHowever, despite the worsening pocketbook economics, homebuyers are willing to sacrifice their financial safety nets to achieve the American dream. More than two-thirds of U.S. consumers now live paycheck to paycheck, with their monthly income going out the door for basic bills and other expenses as soon as it comes in. Among those, 14% cite the financial strain of buying a home as a key reason for their financial condition. That means more than 24 million consumers live with crimped pocketbooks at least partly as a result of a tradeoff they deliberately made in order to own a home. As owning a new home often comes with a more restrictive financial lifestyle, many consumers choose pay-later credit methods that help make that possible. Nowhere is that more evident than with homeowners paying adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs).\nThe share of consumers living paycheck to paycheck overall has decreased very slightly from its peak in April and May. But over the last two years, the youngest and highest-income segments have experienced the greatest strain with this financial tightrope. That signals that homebuyers and homeowners across the spectrum are choosing to put a larger share of their income toward owning a home.\nOnly about one-third of consumers living paycheck to paycheck do so solely out of financial necessity.\nPYMNTS Intelligence research finds that among consumers living paycheck to paycheck, 31% do so by choice. That is, these consumers\u2019 financial lifestyles are a result of their voluntary spending decisions. This group is the most likely to cite buying a residence as a key reason. Another 34% of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers attribute their financial lifestyle to necessity\u2014to not making enough money to save or pay for anything beyond monthly bills for necessities and whatever discretionary items they choose. The remaining 35% of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers live that way due to a combination of circumstance and choice.\nThese are just some of the findings explored in \u201cThe Adjustable-Rate Reckoning: How Homeownership Is Pushing Millions Paycheck to Paycheck,\u201d the latest installment of\u201c New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence exclusive series. This edition examines the financial tradeoffs consumers make and the expense management strategies they use to afford homeownership. It draws on insights from a survey of 2,135 consumers conducted from June 2, 2025, to June 23, 2025\n24.4 Million Consumers Cite Homeownership as a Reason for Living Paycheck to Paycheck\nHomeownership is a key reason for consumers choosing to live paycheck to paycheck. Nearly one in five such consumers cite buying a home that stretched their budget as a key reason they cannot live solely on their savings. These consumers aren\u2019t buying a bigger or fancier house than they can safely afford. Instead, they\u2019re holding mortgages that cut into their income. This share is greater than the 14% of all paycheck-to-paycheck individuals who said the same. It is far higher than the 7.8% of consumers who live this way by necessity, who cited this reason. The upshot is that homeownership is a major factor behind sending consumers into a paycheck-to-paycheck financial lifestyle. It ranks only behind taking time off work, buying a car and starting a business or freelancing as a primary source of income.\nSimilarly, consumers living paycheck to paycheck by choice are more likely than others in this lifestyle to be considering buying a home. Among these, 13% are actively looking to buy. This percentage is nearly three times the share of those living paycheck to paycheck by necessity. Meanwhile, by-necessity consumers are more likely to be considering purchasing a home down the line.\nHomeowners Are More Likely than Other Paycheck-to-Paycheck Individuals to Use BNPL to Manage Expenses\nWith mortgages often accounting for a significant portion of these consumers\u2019 incomes, they are turning to alternative budgeting tools to manage expenses. Many, for instance, are using BNPL to afford large purchases.\nOne in four consumers living paycheck to paycheck by choice report that they used BNPL for larger purchases in the past six months to manage rising living costs. This figure is more than twice the share of those living paycheck to paycheck by necessity. It seems that the widespread perception that shoppers use BNPL, which typically splits purchase payments into three or four monthly installments, out of desperation may be misleading. Many consumers whose budgets are stretched are using the credit method as a deliberate budgeting strategy.\nEven homeowners are leveraging BNPL as a tool to manage rising living costs. One in five homeowners who pay a mortgage report having used BNPL in the past six months. This figure exceeds the share of renters who reported the same. Mortgage payers are the most likely of all paycheck-to-paycheck consumers to use the pay later method, intentionally utilizing BNPL as a flexible budgeting solution.\nBNPL users are utilizing the credit tool in conjunction with other financial strategies to mitigate rising living costs. For instance, 41% of BNPL users have also reduced their nonessential spending in the past six months. Additionally, one in three have delayed or canceled a major purchase such as appliances, furniture or a car. It is evident that consumers are using BNPL as part of a broader, disciplined financial approach. They are combining flexible payment options with spending cuts to optimize their budgets.\nAdjustable-Rate Mortgages Strain Paycheck-to-Paycheck Homeowners\u2019 Budgets\nAdjustable-rate mortgages can leave consumers in a tricky position financially. As such, borrowers with such mortgages are taking more actions to manage rising living costs than their counterparts with fixed-rate mortgages.\nFor instance, 42% of adjustable-rate mortgage holders living paycheck to paycheck report they have cut back on nonessential spending in the last six months. Just 37% of fixed-rate mortgage holders living paycheck to paycheck say the same. Similarly, 39% of those with adjustable rates have delayed or canceled a major purchase. In comparison, just 31% of those with fixed rates did so.\nThese disparities suggest that, as rates rise, these types of mortgages are cornering homeowners into more intensive financial coping strategies as they juggle cost pressures.\nAdjustable-rate mortgage holders also rely more heavily on credit to make ends meet. They are more likely to use credit cards to cover basic expenses than those with fixed rates. Additionally, nearly eight in 10 paycheck-to-paycheck consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages have increased their use of credit in the last six months. Just over half of those with fixed rates have done the same. Only 2.9% of paycheck-to-paycheck adjustable-rate mortgage holders have decreased their use of credit in that timeframe, compared to 15% of fixed-rate mortgage holders. It appears that, as mortgage payments increase, homeowners are becoming more reliant on deferring payments for purchases.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the consumer trends driving innovation in consumer finance, digital payments and financial inclusion.

      "text": "Nearly half of U.S. consumers report being unable to purchase essential goods such as food, household supplies, and apparel due to stockouts, according to a new report by PYMNTS Intelligence.\nThe research in the June 2025 Consumer Tariff Sentiment report, \u201cStock Out. The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability,\u201d found that 47% of shoppers were unable to find key items in recent weeks. While these shortages stem in part from lingering global disruptions, tariffs are emerging as a clear price driver, and one that is disproportionately affecting younger and financially vulnerable consumers.\nAfter all, among the categories most affected include groceries, personal care products, and clothing; all segments where many U.S. households depend on low-cost imported goods. The downstream impact of the tariff-induced price hikes and supply constraints is that they are tending to hit the hardest where wallets are thinnest: younger and financially vulnerable consumers.\nThe report found Gen Z, millennials, and households living paycheck to paycheck are not only more exposed to product stockouts, but they are also paying more for less variety.\nThis isn\u2019t just a consumer story. It\u2019s a retail reckoning, and potentially a strategic inflection point.\nConsumers Want Clarity and Consistency\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence data shows that consumers, particularly those under financial pressure, are more exposed to tariff-related effects. Paycheck-to-paycheck households without savings were significantly more likely to report stockouts in essential goods. They also showed higher reliance on low-cost imports, with 22% using them for food and 28% for clothing, compared to 12% and 22% respectively among financially secure shoppers.\nMeanwhile, Gen Z and millennials, who dominate emerging purchasing power, are also more affected due to their price sensitivity and preferences for affordable, global brands.\nRetailers that proactively address these issues through transparent pricing, adaptive sourcing and stronger supply visibility may have a chance to redefine consumer trust and loyalty. Underscoring this is the fact that while 1 in 3 consumers said retailers were direct in attributing price increases to tariffs, another quarter received only vague references to \u201chigher costs.\u201d In an inflationary environment, that lack of clarity can potentially drive uncertainty and defection.\nRead the report: Stock Out. The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability\nOn the upshot, retailers may have a role to play in bridging the communication gap. Price changes and product shortages \u2014 when explained clearly \u2014 don\u2019t necessarily erode trust. On the contrary, transparency can help to serve as a competitive advantage, especially among younger demographics who increasingly value authenticity in brand relationships.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report also found that 48% of consumers expect tariffs to double the pace of inflation. That expectation \u2014 particularly high among Gen Z and financially stressed consumers \u2014 means retailers may have a window to lead with messaging, not just pricing.\nBy integrating tariff impact communications into apps, receipts, loyalty platforms and in-store signage, retailers may be able to shift from reactive to proactive. Instead of being blamed for higher prices, they may ultimately be seen as advocates for consumer interests.\nThe report also found that retailers haven\u2019t stopped attempts at innovating on pricing. As cost pressures rise, multi-tier product strategies may allow stores to maintain access at multiple price points. Private-label lines \u2014 many of which carry lower import exposure \u2014 are increasingly being positioned as first-line alternatives to global brands impacted by tariffs. In previous inflationary cycles, retailers that expanded affordable options often saw stronger customer retention and brand affinity, particularly among younger and lower-income segments.\nThe current pressure from tariffs and global sourcing is real. But for retailers willing to rethink supply chains, double down on private-label innovation and engage transparently with their customers, the moment offers more than a challenge. It could offer a brand-building opportunity."

      "text": "Adjustable-rate mortgages have benefits and drawbacks that you should carefully consider when choosing a home loan. Learn about how ARMs work, the different types of ARMs, when an ARM may be a good option, and when to think about refinancing to a fixed-rate mortgage.\nHow Do ARMs Work?\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a loan with an interest rate that will change throughout the life of the mortgage. This means that, over time, your monthly payments may go up or down.\nThis is different from a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM), which has a fixed interest rate that is set when you take out the loan and does not change. With this type of loan, your monthly payments will not change.\nARMs have two distinct periods:\n- Initial period: Also known as the fixed-rate period, during this time, the interest rate on your loan doesn't change. The initial period can range from six months to 10 years. The most common ARM terms will have an initial period of 3, 5 or 10 years.\nAfter the initial period, most ARMs adjust. Simply put, when your loan adjusts, your interest rate may change.\n- Adjustment period: All ARMs have adjustment periods that determine when and how often the interest rate can change. Your adjusted rate will be based on your individual loan terms and the current market.\nYou need to make sure you are financially prepared for rate adjustments if you are considering an ARM.\nWhat Are the Different Types of ARMs?\nThere are different types of ARMs that lenders offer. The name of these ARMs will indicate:\n- The duration of the initial period.\n- How often in a year your rate can adjust during the adjustment period.\nLet\u2019s look at an example: The most common adjustable-rate mortgage is a 5/1 ARM. This means you will have an initial period of five years (the \u201c5\u201d), during which the interest rate doesn\u2019t change. After that time, you can expect your ARM to adjust once a year (the \u201c1\u201d).\nMost ARMS will also typically offer a rate cap structure, which is meant to limit how much your rate can increase or decrease.\nThere are three different caps:\n- Initial cap: Limits how much your rate can increase when your rate first adjusts.\n- Periodic cap: Limits how much your rate can increase from one adjustment period to the next.\n- Lifetime cap: Limits how much your rate can increase or decrease over the life of your loan.\nLet\u2019s say you have a 5/1 ARM with a 5/2/5 cap structure. This means on the sixth year \u2014 after your initial period expires \u2014 your rate can increase by a maximum of 5 percentage points (the first \"5\") above the initial interest rate. Every year thereafter, your rate can adjust a maximum of 2 percentage points (the second number, \"2\"), but your interest rate can never increase more than 5 percentage points (the last number, \"5\") over the life of the loan.\nWhen shopping for an ARM, you should look for interest rate caps you can afford.\nWhen Should You Consider an ARM?\nMany homeowners choose an ARM to take advantage of the lower mortgage rates during the initial period. You may consider an adjustable-rate mortgage if:\n- You plan on moving or selling your home within five years, or before the adjustment period of the loan.\n- Interest rates are high when you buy your home.\nIf rates are low, it would make more sense to get a fixed-rate mortgage to lock in the low rate.\nKeep in mind that, with an ARM, there is a level of uncertainty about how much your monthly payment will go up or down. Depending on the market, your rate could adjust upward and increase your monthly payments. It is important to be mindful of this because you are still responsible for making your monthly payments if your rate adjusts upward.\nWhen Should You Consider Refinancing to a Fixed-Rate Mortgage?\nSwitching from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage is one of the most common reasons homeowners choose to refinance.\nYou may want to refinance your ARM into a FRM if:\n- Your ARM is scheduled to adjust soon. This is especially important if you cannot afford a higher monthly mortgage payment.\n- Mortgage rates are low. This will help you lock in a low rate and take advantage of the stability of a fixed-rate mortgage.\nAlternatively, if you plan to move soon, it may make financial sense to stick with an ARM.\nBefore you make plans to refinance later, it\u2019s important to take into account the costs of refinancing \u2014 which are similar to what you pay when you purchase a home \u2014 and any penalties you may face if you refinance too soon.\nSome ARMs may require you to pay fees or penalties if you refinance or pay off the ARM early, usually during the initial period (the first three to five years) of the loan. Prepayment penalties can total several thousand dollars. It\u2019s important to know about these potential extra fees before you take out an ARM.\nWhen it comes to mortgages, you have options. To determine the right mortgage for your situation, lean on your lender or financial professional for guidance. Be sure you know the details of how and when this type of loan may change your monthly payments.\nLast reviewed: January 02, 2024\nMy Home in your inbox\nSign up to receive resources, tools and tips about buying, owning, refinancing, selling and renting a home in your inbox."

When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve as it uses the Interest on Reserve Balances rate to steer the federal funds rate toward the target range.(2)\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target range. The Fed's primary tool for influencing the federal funds rate is the interest the Fed pays on the funds that banks hold as reserve balances at their Federal Reserve Bank, which is the Interest on Reserves Balances (IORB) rate. Because banks are unlikely to lend funds in the federal funds market for less than they get paid in their reserve balance account at the Federal Reserve, the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) is an effective tool for guiding the federal funds rate. (3) Whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers the target range for the federal funds rate depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the Committee may temper economic activity by raising the target range for federal funds rate, and increasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may spur greater economic activity by lowering the target range for federal funds rate, and decreasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. (3) Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets.\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)\nReferences\n(1) Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \"Federal funds.\" Fedpoints, August 2007.\n(2) Monetary Policy, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n(3) The Fed Explained, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nFor further information, see The Fed's New Monetary Policy Tools, Page One Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nFor questions on the data, please contact the data source.

      "text": "Adjustable-rate mortgages have benefits and drawbacks that you should carefully consider when choosing a home loan. Learn about how ARMs work, the different types of ARMs, when an ARM may be a good option, and when to think about refinancing to a fixed-rate mortgage.\nHow Do ARMs Work?\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a loan with an interest rate that will change throughout the life of the mortgage. This means that, over time, your monthly payments may go up or down.\nThis is different from a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM), which has a fixed interest rate that is set when you take out the loan and does not change. With this type of loan, your monthly payments will not change.\nARMs have two distinct periods:\n- Initial period: Also known as the fixed-rate period, during this time, the interest rate on your loan doesn't change. The initial period can range from six months to 10 years. The most common ARM terms will have an initial period of 3, 5 or 10 years.\nAfter the initial period, most ARMs adjust. Simply put, when your loan adjusts, your interest rate may change.\n- Adjustment period: All ARMs have adjustment periods that determine when and how often the interest rate can change. Your adjusted rate will be based on your individual loan terms and the current market.\nYou need to make sure you are financially prepared for rate adjustments if you are considering an ARM.\nWhat Are the Different Types of ARMs?\nThere are different types of ARMs that lenders offer. The name of these ARMs will indicate:\n- The duration of the initial period.\n- How often in a year your rate can adjust during the adjustment period.\nLet\u2019s look at an example: The most common adjustable-rate mortgage is a 5/1 ARM. This means you will have an initial period of five years (the \u201c5\u201d), during which the interest rate doesn\u2019t change. After that time, you can expect your ARM to adjust once a year (the \u201c1\u201d).\nMost ARMS will also typically offer a rate cap structure, which is meant to limit how much your rate can increase or decrease.\nThere are three different caps:\n- Initial cap: Limits how much your rate can increase when your rate first adjusts.\n- Periodic cap: Limits how much your rate can increase from one adjustment period to the next.\n- Lifetime cap: Limits how much your rate can increase or decrease over the life of your loan.\nLet\u2019s say you have a 5/1 ARM with a 5/2/5 cap structure. This means on the sixth year \u2014 after your initial period expires \u2014 your rate can increase by a maximum of 5 percentage points (the first \"5\") above the initial interest rate. Every year thereafter, your rate can adjust a maximum of 2 percentage points (the second number, \"2\"), but your interest rate can never increase more than 5 percentage points (the last number, \"5\") over the life of the loan.\nWhen shopping for an ARM, you should look for interest rate caps you can afford.\nWhen Should You Consider an ARM?\nMany homeowners choose an ARM to take advantage of the lower mortgage rates during the initial period. You may consider an adjustable-rate mortgage if:\n- You plan on moving or selling your home within five years, or before the adjustment period of the loan.\n- Interest rates are high when you buy your home.\nIf rates are low, it would make more sense to get a fixed-rate mortgage to lock in the low rate.\nKeep in mind that, with an ARM, there is a level of uncertainty about how much your monthly payment will go up or down. Depending on the market, your rate could adjust upward and increase your monthly payments. It is important to be mindful of this because you are still responsible for making your monthly payments if your rate adjusts upward.\nWhen Should You Consider Refinancing to a Fixed-Rate Mortgage?\nSwitching from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage is one of the most common reasons homeowners choose to refinance.\nYou may want to refinance your ARM into a FRM if:\n- Your ARM is scheduled to adjust soon. This is especially important if you cannot afford a higher monthly mortgage payment.\n- Mortgage rates are low. This will help you lock in a low rate and take advantage of the stability of a fixed-rate mortgage.\nAlternatively, if you plan to move soon, it may make financial sense to stick with an ARM.\nBefore you make plans to refinance later, it\u2019s important to take into account the costs of refinancing \u2014 which are similar to what you pay when you purchase a home \u2014 and any penalties you may face if you refinance too soon.\nSome ARMs may require you to pay fees or penalties if you refinance or pay off the ARM early, usually during the initial period (the first three to five years) of the loan. Prepayment penalties can total several thousand dollars. It\u2019s important to know about these potential extra fees before you take out an ARM.\nWhen it comes to mortgages, you have options. To determine the right mortgage for your situation, lean on your lender or financial professional for guidance. Be sure you know the details of how and when this type of loan may change your monthly payments.\nLast reviewed: January 02, 2024\nMy Home in your inbox\nSign up to receive resources, tools and tips about buying, owning, refinancing, selling and renting a home in your inbox."

      "text": "Having reached their highest point since 2000, mortgage interest rates recently experienced their most substantial weekly decline since July 2022. This significant drop, the most pronounced in over a year, resulted in the first uptick in mortgage demand in a month.\nAs per the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index, total mortgage application volume increased by 2.5% last week compared to the previous week. Specifically, applications for home purchase mortgages rose by 3%. Joel Kan, the vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, attributed the rate decrease last week to factors such as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s issuance update, the Federal Reserve adopting a dovish tone in the November FOMC statement, and data indicating a slower job market.\nApplications to refinance a home loan experienced a 2% increase for the week but remained 7% lower than the same week one year ago. The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to pause its rate hike in the latest meeting, coupled with the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 October jobs report indicating fewer jobs added than expected, bodes well for mortgage rates. If the Fed continues its rate pause (or even considers a rate drop) in the upcoming meetings, and if the job market remains cool, there is potential for a continued downward trend in mortgage rates. The Fed\u2019s last rate-setting meeting of the year is scheduled for December 12-13.\nMortgage rates experienced a dip midweek until slightly rising again across all loan products except for the 30-Year VA loan type.\n| Product | Rate | Mid Week | Change |\n| 30-year fixed | 7.56% | 7.46% | \u21e7 \u2013 0.10 |\n| 15-year fixed | 6.92% | 6.85% | \u21e7 \u2013 0.07 |\n| 30-year jumbo | 7.87% | 7.82% | \u21e7 \u2013 0.05 |\n| 5/1 ARM | 7.21% | 7.19% | \u21e7 \u2013 0.02 |\n| 30-year FHA | 6.91% | 6.82% | \u21e7 \u2013 0.09 |\n| 30-year VA | 6.74% | 6.83% | \u21e9 \u2013 0.11 |\nDISCLAIMER: ALL LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT APPROVAL.

CURRENT INTEREST RATES SHOWN ARE INDICATIVE OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND INDIVIDUAL QUALIFICATIONS AND WILL VARY UPON YOUR LOCK-IN PERIOD, LOAN TYPE, CREDIT SCORE, LOAN TO VALUE, PURPOSE, AND LENDING SOURCE.\n30-year fixed-rate mortgages\nPresently, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage sits at 7.46%, reflecting a drop of 42 basis points from the preceding week. Despite its interest rate being higher than that of the 15-year mortgage, the 30-year option is favored by many buyers for its advantage of providing more budget-friendly monthly payments.\nget approved in 24 hours\nget approved in 24 hours\n15-year fixed-rate mortgages\nThe current interest rate for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.85%, showcasing a decrease of 39 basis points from the week prior. Choosing a 15-year mortgage enables borrowers to pay back their loan repayment quicker compared to the 30-year option. While this leads to increased monthly payments, it substantially diminishes the total interest paid over the loan\u2019s duration.\n30-year jumbo mortgages\nThe interest rate for a 30-year jumbo loan has decreased by 19 basis points, currently resting at 7.82%. Jumbo loans generally carry higher interest rates due to their larger loan amounts. Nevertheless, the current rate aligns with the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\n5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages\nRight now the interest rate for a 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is 7.19%, indicating a 5 basis point decline from the preceding week. Generally, adjustable-rate mortgages feature lower interest rates in contrast to fixed-rate mortgages, with the current margin being to 27 basis points in relation to a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\nUse our free mortgage and amortization calculators to calculate your monthly payment, including insurance, taxes, and interest.\nGet My Custom Rate QuoteNo SSN required.

      "text": "Freddie Mac\u2019s Newly Enhanced Mortgage Rate Survey Explained\nFor decades, the mortgage industry has relied on Freddie Mac\u2019s Primary Mortgage Market Survey\u00ae (PMMS) as the industry standard for mortgage interest rates in the United States. Throughout the history of the PMMS, we have adjusted the methodology to account for changes in technology and the mortgage industry while maintaining continuity with historical rates. In order to ensure that the PMMS continues to provide high-quality information on the mortgage market, we are making new enhancements to our methodology.\nIn this Research Note, we provide details of the adjustments and explain how the changes may impact users of the PMMS. We also discuss how the adjustments in methodology would have impacted historical PMMS results had we implemented these changes at an earlier date. While the methodological changes will set up the PMMS for continued success in years to come, the total impact on rates is currently very small, as we document below.\nBackground on the PMMS\nFreddie Mac has been surveying lenders on weekly mortgage rates since 1971.1 The survey included discount points and origination fees for 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate and 5/1 hybrid amortizing adjustable-rate mortgage products.\nThe survey captures mortgage rates for first-lien, conventional, conforming, purchase mortgages with a borrower who has a loan-to-value of 80% and excellent credit. In addition, it captures adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates indexed to U.S. Treasury yields. The lenders surveyed are asked for both the initial coupon rate and points as well as the margin on the ARM products. The lenders represent a mix of business models\u2014credit unions, commercial banks, and mortgage lending companies\u2014roughly proportional to the level of mortgage business each type commands nationwide. The rates are collected from Monday through Wednesday, and the results are released on Thursdays at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).\nEnhancement of Freddie Mac\u2019s mortgage rate survey\nThere have been growing challenges with the traditional survey approach. The current survey operates on sampled data where a subset of records in the overall population is selected. As the underlying population changes in response to economic conditions and the evolution of the mortgage market, the survey faces a variety of issues that could result in statistical bias and eventually reduce the reliability of the results.\nWhile our survey carefully samples lenders covering a broad range of lender types to reflect the U.S. mortgage market, we had to make frequent adjustments to our selection process to reflect changes in the housing market. The entry and exit of new participants into and out of the mortgage market creates more complexity in accurately tracking the market with a traditional survey method.\nMany institutions have turned to administrative datasets to supplement or replace survey methods. Administrative datasets are data collected by governments or other organizations for non-statistical reasons to provide overviews on registration, transactions, and record keeping. To enhance the PMMS, we have also decided to turn to administrative data, leveraging Freddie Mac\u2019s vast data resources to estimate weekly mortgage rates. For the long-run viability of the PMMS, Freddie Mac has enhanced the PMMS methodology to improve the quality\u2014as well as reliability and consistency\u2014of its results.\nFor the long-run viability of the PMMS, Freddie Mac has enhanced the PMMS methodology to improve the quality\u2014as well as reliability and consistency\u2014of its results.\nLeveraging loan application data\nGoing forward, the traditional survey approach will be replaced with loan application information submitted to Freddie Mac\u2019s automated underwriting system, Loan Product Advisor\u00ae (LPA). LPA helps simplify the origination processes and provides lenders with greater certainty of meeting Freddie Mac\u2019s eligibility requirements.\nThe loan application data is extensive and contains various information about the property being considered for purchase, the borrower\u2019s financial situation, employment history, and more.\nIn general, mortgage rates are determined by a combination of various factors such as current economic conditions, the lender\u2019s risk appetite and overhead costs, and borrowers\u2019 credit profiles. However, the application data is neither a pledge by the applicant nor a commitment by the lender.\nThere are many advantages of using loan application data instead of a survey, including the dramatic increases in coverage and a real-time view of the mortgage market. The loan application data also covers a broad range of lenders and geographies in the United States and immediately and automatically adjusts to shifts in the composition of the mortgage market. While the current PMMS in recent years has captured mortgage rates reported by lenders in a majority of states, the loan application covers lenders in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, on a weekly basis.\nLimitations of the loan application data\nAlthough there are many advantages of using loan application data to measure the mortgage rate, it comes with a cost. First, we do not have the information on the mortgage rate when lenders do not intend to sell to the secondary market or if they do not use the LPA as the underwriting tool.\nAs noted above, we measure the mortgage rate not in the origination but in the application stage. Therefore, our reported rate does not represent the rate at the time of loan origination. Not all applications will necessarily be approved and result in originated loans. Users should be aware of these factors when using the PMMS.\nIn addition, using LPA will result in two major changes related to our PMMS output:\n- We will no longer report interest rates, margin, or discount points and fees for the hybrid 5/1 Treasury Indexed Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM).\n- We will no longer report average discount points and origination fees for the 30-year and the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage (FRM).\nWe will not include the ARM products rate due to insufficient numbers of applicants with ARM programs in recent years in LPA data.\nThe cessation of reporting average points and fees merits some further discussion. Since LPA does not capture discount points or origination fees, we are not able to report them in the PMMS going forward. The full cost of a mortgage is captured by both the interest rate and the discount points and origination fees paid by a borrower. Theoretically, a borrower who pays discount points would receive a lower rate compared to the rate they would receive if they paid no points. However, in practice, we have found that in recent years the difference in rate between a borrower paying discount points and borrowers who do not pay discount points has been very near to zero.\nConsider Exhibit 1. We analyzed loans funded by Freddie Mac where the loan meets the PMMS profile and the closing date was between 2018 and 2021\u2014then segmented the data into two sets: (1) borrowers who purchased discount points and (2) borrowers who did not purchase discount points. We found that for purchase transactions, mortgage rates are nearly the same regardless of whether borrowers purchased discount points. We found similar outcomes in refinance and cash- out refinance, where average mortgage rates did not change regardless of whether borrowers purchased discount points.2\nMethodology\nOur main goal is to capture the average interest rate from loan applications submitted to Freddie Mac\u2019s LPA tool. In order to align with the historical PMMS approach, we will limit the selection of loan applications to conventional, conforming, fully amortizing home purchase loans for borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit.\nAt first, we collect all purchase loan applications that could result in future home purchases. Next, we clean the data by removing irrelevant, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, and incomplete data. Then, we deduplicate the transactions to extract the most recent submissions after eliminating the transactions with outliers.\nThen, we select the loan applications meeting the following criteria:\n- Single Family (SF) Loan \u2014 A mortgage loan secured by a property that contains one to four residential dwelling units.\n- Owner Occupied (OO) \u2014 A property in which at least one unit is occupied by an individual with an ownership interest.\n- Conventional \u2014 A mortgage or loan that is not offered or secured by a government entity.\nIt is available through private lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies. - 30-year or 15-year fixed rate mortgage \u2014 A loan that will be paid off completely in 30 or 15 years, respectively, for which the interest rate stays the same for as long as the borrower keeps the mortgage.\n- A single-unit property \u2014 A property containing only one dwelling unit.\n- Origination Loan-to-Value ratio \u2014 LTV greater than or equal to 75 and less than or equal to 80.\n- Origination FICO score \u2014 740 or above.\n- Conforming Loan \u2014 A mortgage with terms and conditions that meet the underwriting guidelines of the GSE (government-sponsored enterprises). To be consistent, we exclude loans with a higher loan amount than the national conforming loan limits ($647,200 in 2022).\n- Property is within the lower 48 contiguous states or the District of Columbia (excludes Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories3)\nWe selected these loan features to maximize the compatibility between our new approach and the historical survey-based PMMS.\nLastly, we applied several additional rules to calculate the timely mortgage rate. In LPA, a lender may submit the same application multiple times in the loan application stage. Therefore, in our final selection, we keep only the existing applicants when their rates have changed compared to prior submissions, while we include all new applicants. By selecting only new applicants and existing applicants only if their rate change, we ensure our measure represents the most recent rate in the current mortgage market.\nSpecifically, we:\n- Filter LPA records to include only the purchase applications that could result in new home applications.\n- Create weekly application measures by aggregating applications from Thursday prior to the current week through Wednesday.\n- Set the first week of 2005 as the initial period, calculating the weekly rate. We provide the historical series of the PMMS under our new methodology back to 2005 to enable users to perform time series analysis.\n- Focus on the mortgage rate based on the latest submission for any loan application during the week. Our approach differs from collecting the mortgage rate based on the rate set date, which includes only the loan applications when the rates are locked.\nPMMS calendar\nGoing forward, the PMMS will be published weekly each Thursday at 12 p.m. ET. When a U.S. holiday falls on a Thursday, the PMMS will publish on the Wednesday of that week.\nThe week of application activity starts at 12:00 a.m. ET the Thursday of last week and goes through 11:59p.m. ET the following Wednesday. We collect the mortgage rate of all purchase applications that meet our weekly criteria and calculate the average mortgage rate.\nComparing the new methodology to historical PMMS and external measures\nIn preparation for launching the newly enhanced PMMS, we created a complete weekly time series dating back to January 2005, when the loan application data collected from LPA was considered reliable for PMMS purposes. As we applied the same filters to the historical data as to the real-time data, the weekly releases are aligned with the same data-generation process as the historical series. This allowed us to construct a time series of weekly rates that would have been published if the new methodology had been applied historically in real-time.\nWe find that the new methodology based on loan applications tracks very closely with our historical survey approach. On average, the difference between the traditional survey approach and the new approach for the 30-year FRM rate is about 0.066 percentage points from 2005 through 2021, with a standard deviation of about 0.074 percentage points. See Exhibit 3 below.\nWe conducted a similar experiment for the 15-year FRM; see Exhibit 4 below. On average, the difference between the traditional survey approach and the new approach for the 15-year FRM rate is about 0.0475 percentage points from 2005 through 2021, with a standard deviation of about 0.069 percentage points.\nThe very small difference in the rates reported in our historical survey and the real-time estimate of the new LPA-based approach give us great confidence in using the new approach. We also tested our results with other loan datasets purchased from third parties applying the same PMMS filters. The average rate computed using the new PMMS methodology and in the third-party data filtered to match the PMMS were quite similar. Finally, we assessed the results with the closed loans funded by Freddie Mac collected from the Uniform Closing Dataset after applying the same PMMS filters and we received comparable results.\nThe very small difference in the rates reported in our historical survey and the real-time estimate of the new LPA-based approach give us great confidence in using the new approach.\nConclusion\nBy using comprehensive and timely loan application data, our enhanced PMMS will produce a more reliable and accurate mortgage rate. Instead of surveying lenders, the weekly mortgage rate will be based on thousands of applications submitted to Freddie Mac from lenders across the country. We believe this improved PMMS will reflect the broader market and be able to monitor the real-time mortgage rate more closely.\nWe believe this improved PMMS will reflect the broader market and be able to monitor the real- time mortgage rate closely.\nPMMS users interested in time series properties using the new methodology are encouraged to submit this form to receive a file containing the historical real-time estimates displayed in Exhibits 3 and 4 above.\nPMMS data users with questions about the methodological change are encouraged to reach out to us at [email protected].\n-\nFootnotes\n- For more background see Freddie Mac\u2019s Mortgage Rate Survey Explained \u2014 Freddie Mac.\n- We also sampled closed loans from the HMDA 2021 dataset. We found similar results as what is displayed in Exhibit 1, showing that mortgage rates tend to stay consistent regardless of whether borrowers purchased discount points.\n- Alaska, Hawaii, the U.S. territories of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have special statutory provisions that provide higher national loan limits than those in the lower contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief Economist\nLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief Economist\nMihwa Kim, Macro Housing Economics Director"

Please confirm your email to view all our Trackers.\nWorried about your financial situation? You\u2019re in good company. PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s Paycheck-to-Paycheck index hit a new high of 68.4% in May. Whether it\u2019s due to persistent inflation, rising housing costs or the impact of tariffs, more Americans than ever\u2014684 out of every 1,000\u2014are walking a financial tightrope, watching their monthly paycheck rapidly dwindle as it\u2019s used to cover essential payments (and splurges). What\u2019s more, the group of people who struggle to pay their bills climbed for the third-straight month, reaching 24.2% of all consumers.\nOur latest survey reveals that amid this pocketbook stress, six in ten consumers feel uncomfortable when thinking about their finances. The good news is that there\u2019s an antidote for at least some of that angst. Specialized budgeting apps and advanced personal finance tools can\u2019t magically send extra dollars to your bank account, but they can help consumers stay worry-free and financially stable, especially during difficult times. Yet even though they can unlock \u201cextra\u201d dollars currently going toward wasteful or inefficient spending, consumers woefully underutilize them.\nAmong the respondents with trouble making ends meet, more than half who use specialized, advanced budgeting tools, such as Intuit\u2019s Credit Karma (which absorbed Mint last year), YNAB (You Need a Budget) or any of the dozens of others out there, said they feel financially comfortable. Meanwhile, just 12% of those who use only rudimentary personal finance tools\u2014and almost none who don\u2019t budget at all\u2014indicated the same. Among the survey\u2019s many findings: Daily budget reminders offer an easy way for people to feel happier about their financial situations.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in \u201cFeeling Stressed? Budgeting Works Wonders (Really),\u201d the latest installment of the \u201cNew Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence exclusive series. This edition draws on insights from a survey of 2,040 U.S. consumers conducted from May 1, 2025, to May 21, 2025.\nMost consumers\u2014even those with high incomes\u2014feel concerned about their finances.\nPersonal finances are a source of stress for most consumers. In fact, 24% feel highly anxious and 36% are somewhat concerned about their financial situation, while only 40% feel comfortable. Lower-income individuals are understandably the most likely to worry, at 71%, but most middle and high earners are also worried.\nNaturally, consumers living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to pay their bills tend to feel the most anxiety. Just less than three-quarters are either highly anxious (47%) or somewhat (28%) concerned. Even among individuals not living paycheck to paycheck, 39% express at least some worry. Meanwhile, the data highlights that financial stress impacts the typical consumer regardless of age, with little variation across generations\u2014although baby boomers are somewhat less likely to report concern. 1\nBudgeting Brings Peace of Mind\nMost advanced budgeters feel comfortable with their finances, even if they are struggling to make ends meet.\nSpecialized budgeting tools can be a powerful tool for reducing financial stress. Nearly half of advanced budgeters (47%) feel comfortable with the state of their pocketbooks. This is substantially higher than the levels seen among basic budgeters and those who do not actively budget, at 34% and 39%, respectively.\nSo which consumers tend to be advanced budgeters? Those with household incomes over $100,000 per year are the most likely, at 45%, compared to just 27% of their low-income counterparts. Conversely, 28% of low-income respondents are non-budgeters, more than twice the rate seen in the high-income bracket. Another clear trend is that younger consumers are more likely to use advanced budgeting tools. Gen Z leads, at 55%, followed by millennials, at 48%.\nThe benefits of advanced budgeting stand out among consumers who struggle to make ends meet. In fact, 53% of consumers who live paycheck to paycheck and both struggle to pay bills and use advanced tools still report feeling financially comfortable. This is several times higher than seen among basic budgeters and non-budgeters. Among consumers who live paycheck to paycheck with no difficulty paying bills and those who do not, there is little variation in budgeting styles. That said, there is complex psychology at work, because using advanced tools forces consumers to get up close and personal with their financial health\u2014or lack thereof. Knowledge is power, but not necessarily comforting.\nPlease Remind Me\nDaily budget reminders significantly boost financial comfort, but many consumers never use them.\nBudget reminders are simple but highly effective\u2014and the more frequently they\u2019re used, the better. Fifty-four percent of consumers who set their budgeting tools to deliver daily nudges feel comfortable about their finances. This drops to between 30% and 42% for those who receive fewer reminders.\nHowever, just 14% of consumers opt for daily reminders. What\u2019s more, 40% of respondents have their budgeting tools nudge them less than once a month or not at all. All of this puts a revealing spotlight on the stark lack of consumer engagement with the typical reminder options offered by many banking apps and other tools.\nWhile daily reminders are underappreciated across demographic segments, the data reveals elevated use in a few segments. Interestingly, 25% of those struggling to pay their bills receive daily nudges, considerably higher than among other respondents. Millennials are the generation likeliest to use daily reminders, at 24%, followed by bridge millennials, at 23%.\nFinding the Right Tools\nBudgeting is not something consumers prioritize, even as they want the planning capabilities and peace of mind that budgeting tools offer.\nDespite its benefits, budgeting is not a mainstream habit. In fact, just 21% of consumers report creating or revising a budget in the last year, and only 6.8% found this to be the most effective method they used to get a handle on their finances. Instead, consumers generally make reactionary cuts to their purchasing. Over a third of respondents reduced discretionary spending in the last year (36%) or changed shopping habits (34%). Similarly, more than one-quarter postponed major purchases (28%), used savings to cover expenses (27%) or canceled subscriptions or services (27%).\nDedicated budget apps don\u2019t just help with money pressures today\u2014they also aid in planning for the future. Money goals range from earning and saving more to paying down debt. Interestingly, most consumers seem to think they already know where their monthly paychecks are going, and are focused on ways to shore up their personal balance sheets both today and tomorrow.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the trends driving consumer spending and finance.

  "argos_summary": "Adjustable\u2011rate mortgages that surged during the Fed\u2019s 2022\u201123 rate hikes are now pushing many U.S. homeowners into a paycheck\u2011to\u2011paycheck cycle. As SOFR\u2011linked ARM rates climb to 4.39% from 2.91%, monthly payments on a $400k loan jump from $1,667 to $2,001, and 42% of ARM holders have cut discretionary spending versus 31% of fixed\u2011rate holders. Nearly half are using credit cards for essentials, and 46% of ARM owners report increased credit usage, signaling a liquidity squeeze that could dampen consumer demand and pressure the U.S. dollar. The Fed\u2019s continued pause or potential rate cuts could moderate the impact, but the lagged effect of rising mortgage costs remains a key catalyst for near\u2011term consumption softness.",
