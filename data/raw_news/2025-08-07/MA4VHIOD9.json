  "content": "Second quarter of 2025 consolidated gross margin increased over 600 basis points year-over-year to 31.3%, on consolidated revenue of $14.1 million\n\nOSS segment gross margin of 41.3%, on OSS segment revenue of $5.8 million\n\nYear-to-date OSS segment bookings of $25.4 million, supports outlook for accelerating revenue growth and improving profitability for the second half of 2025\n\nESCONDIDO, Calif., Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- One Stop Systems, Inc. (\"OSS\" or the \"Company\") OSS, a leader in rugged Enterprise Class compute for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), autonomy and sensor processing at the edge, reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. Second-quarter and six-month comparisons are to the same year-ago periods unless otherwise noted.\n\n\"The performance of our OSS segment in the first half of the year demonstrates the meaningful progress we have made repositioning the Company for sustained growth,\" stated OSS President and CEO, Mike Knowles. \"We are successfully converting our large, multi-year pipeline into orders, while making strategic investments in R&D. Year-to-date, our OSS segment has generated one of the highest levels of bookings in our history, totaling $25.4 million and representing a book-to-bill ratio of 2.3x. This strong start to 2025 underscores the solid foundation we have built as we capitalize on increasing demand from both defense and commercial customers for our rugged, enterprise-class compute solutions.\"\n\n\"Recent sales and gross margin trends give us growing confidence that our strategy is working and that positive momentum is building. We believe the second half of the year will mark a meaningful inflection point for OSS, with accelerating revenue growth and improving profitability as our business scales to meet rising market demand,\" concluded Mr. Knowles.\n\nConsolidated revenue increased 6.9% to $14.1 million, from $13.2 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nOSS segment revenue increased 4.3%, as compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues related to the development and production of custom server products for a defense customer, higher shipments of data storage products to a U.S. government customer, and the initiation of shipments of server products to a medical device customer.\n\nBressner segment revenue increased 8.7%, as compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nThe following table sets forth net revenue by segment for the three months ended June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024 (Dollars may not calculate due to rounding):\n\nConsolidated gross margin was 31.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to 25.2% in the prior year quarter. On a segment basis, the OSS segment had a gross margin of 41.3%, an increase of 16.4 percentage points as compared to the prior year of 24.9%. The increase in OSS segment gross margin was due to a more profitable mix of products shipped in the quarter, as well as the non-recurrence of an inventory charge recognized in the prior year quarter. The Company's Bressner segment had a gross margin percentage of 24.3%, compared to 25.5% in the same period last year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 11.6% to $6.2 million. This increase was predominantly attributable to higher marketing and selling costs due to an increase in personnel costs from the additions in headcount made during 2024 as well as an increase in research and development costs driven by higher engineering labor to support new product development.\n\nThe Company reported a net loss of $2.0 million, or $(0.09) per share for the three months ended June 30, 2025, as compared to a net loss of $2.3 million, or $(0.11) per share, in the prior year period. The Company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $1.5 million, or $(0.07) per share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $1.8 million, or $(0.09) per share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was a loss of $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.4 million in the prior year period.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company reported cash and short-term investments of $9.5 million and total working capital of $23.1 million, compared to cash and short-term investments of $10.0 million and total working capital of $24.0 million at December 31, 2024.\n\nConsolidated revenue was $26.4 million, compared to $25.9 million for the same period last year. The Company's OSS segment saw a decrease in revenue of $88,000, or 0.8%. This decrease was primarily driven by lower volume of revenue to a commercial aerospace customer, partially offset by higher volume of revenue to a defense customer and a medical device customer. Bressner experienced an increase in revenue of $603,000, or 4.1%, as compared to the same period in 2024, due to higher book-and-ship revenue in the period, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates.\n\n\n\nThe following table sets forth net revenue by product category for the six months ended June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, by segment:\n\nConsolidated gross margin was 31.9%, as compared to 27.3% in the same year-ago quarter. OSS segment gross margin was 43.3%, an increase of 13.7 percentage points from the same period a year ago. Bressner segment gross margin was 23.8%, as compared to 25.6% in the same period in 2024.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 15.2% to $12.2 million. This increase was predominantly attributable to higher personnel costs, impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher research and development expenses due to higher engineering costs to support targeted investments in new product development.\n\nOSS reported a net loss of $4.0 million, or $(0.19) per share, as compared to a net loss of $3.7 million, or $(0.18) per share, in the prior year. The Company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $2.9 million, or $(0.14) per share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $2.7 million, or $(0.13) per share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was a loss of $2.2 million, a decrease from an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.9 million in the prior year.\n\nThe Company is executing a strategic plan targeting both commercial and defense markets within its OSS segment, aiming to provide integrated solutions and establish OSS as a platform incumbent on large, multi-year programs. This approach is expected to drive long-term value by increasing predictable, recurring revenue and building a strong, multi-year backlog.\n\nDuring the first half of 2025, bookings in the Company's OSS segment were $25.4 million, which included orders from new and existing customers. These orders are expected to contribute to OSS segment revenue in the second half of 2025 and into 2026.\n\nThe Company continues to anticipate consolidated revenue of $59 million to $61 million for the full year of 2025. This includes expected OSS segment revenue of approximately $30 million, representing over 20% year-over-year growth. In addition, the Company expects to be EBITDA break-even for the full year of 2025.\n\nOSS will hold a conference call to discuss its results for the second quarter of 2025, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Thursday, August 7, 2025\n\nTime: 10:00 a.m. ET (7:00 a.m. PT)\n\nToll-free dial-in: 1-800-579-2543\n\nInternational dial-in: 1-785-424-1789\n\nConference ID: ONESTOP (required for entry)\n\nWebcast: https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1720675&tp_key=5676c84cc3\n\nA replay of the call will be available after 1:00 p.m. ET on August 7, 2025, through August 21, 2025.\n\nOne Stop Systems, Inc.

You can also follow OSS on X, , and .\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe believe that the use of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, is helpful for an investor to assess the performance of the Company. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition expense, impairment of long-lived assets, financing costs, government funded programs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation expense, and expenses related to discontinued operations.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time.\n\nOur adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. Our adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n\nAdjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that exclusion of certain selected items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. We use this measure along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines non-GAAP income (loss) as income or (loss) before amortization, government funded programs, impairment of long lived assets, stock-based compensation, expenses related to discontinued operations, and acquisition costs. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income (loss) on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\n\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP net income and basic and diluted earnings per share:\n\nOne Stop Systems cautions you that statements in this press release that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

      "text": "No Compromise\n|\nOne Stop Systems, Inc. (OSS) designs and manufactures innovative edge computing modules and systems for AI Transportable applications including ruggedized servers, compute accelerators, expansion systems, flash storage arrays and Ion Accelerator\u2122 SAN, NAS and data recording software. These products are used for AI data set capture, training, and large-scale inference in the defense, oil and gas, mining, autonomous vehicles and rugged entertainment applications. |\nNo Compromise\nIntegration of the highest end data center class CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, NVMe SSDs, and networking in rugged edge platforms for demanding AI workloads.\nSignal Integrity\nExpert PCIe & NVLink designs delivering next generation designs up to 32GTs including scale-out PCIe Gen 4 designs of 200+ endpoint devices at the system or rack level.\nShock and Vibration\nDesigns for stringent vehicle specifications to operate in harsh environments leveraging expertise in structural analysis & simulation for low SWaP.\nLiquid and Air\nExpertise in extreme temperature ranges for systems with challenging heat generating components using advanced thermal design for air & liquid solutions.\nAir, Sea, Land Compatible\nFlexible power subsystem designs accommodating a wide range of transportable edge system inputs from 48VDC to 3\u00d8 (Phase), 400Hz AC inputs for 6000W GPU systems.\nSystem Management & RDMA Data Flows\nFlexible system management, scale-out BIOS and SAN/NAS storage software using NVMeoF and GPU Direct capability through intuitive user interfaces.\nThe rugged edge computing landscape is becoming increasingly complex with new generations of technologies, such as the latest AI focused GPUs, releasing annually rather than every 2-3 years. Whether the end application is commercial or defense, rugged edge servers must not only deliver cutting-edge compute performance but also withstand extreme environmental conditions.\nWhen the PCI-SIG formally added support for 675W add-in card devices in the PCI Express Card Electromechanical (CEM) specification in August 2023, NVIDIA\u2019s most powerful CEM GPU, the NVIDIA H100 80GB had a maximum power consumption of 350W. While some devices were starting to push the limits of datacenter thermodynamics \u2013 high density systems of many 675W devices seemed like a distant reality. However, with power constraints uncapped and the need for higher performing GPUs skyrocketing, the industry quickly came out with devices taking full advantage of the new specification capability. NVIDIA quickly replaced the H100 80GB with the H100 NVL, increasing power density to 400W. While this small jump was manageable for existing installations, NVIDIA then dove all-in with the H200 NVL released in late 2024 at 600W. The rapid transition from 350W to 600W has put power and cooling technologies in the spotlight in a race to solve this next generation challenge.\nThe advent of technology has always brought about significant changes to various industries, and the transportation sector is no exception. Among the most transformative innovations in recent years is the development of autonomous vehicles, particularly trucks. The potential for autonomous trucks to revolutionize freight transport is immense, raising the fundamental question: will these technological advancements make human drivers obsolete? To explore this question, we must consider the current state of autonomous driving technology, the economic implications, and the societal impact of removing human drivers from the equation.\nOne Stop Systems\n2235 Enterprise Street #110, Escondido, CA 92029\nToll Free: +1 (877) 438-2724\nLocal: +1 (760) 745-9883\nContact Form Map\nBressner Technology\nA Subsidiary of One Stop Systems\nIndustriestra\u00dfe 51, D - 82194 Gr\u00f6benzell, Germany\nTel: +49 (0)8142 29113-98 \u2022 Fax: +49 (0)8142 47284-77\nContact Form Map"
