      "feedback": "Strengths: thorough regime framing, credible linkages from AI-driven labor shifts to asset pricing, and concrete Ford/NVIDIA data points that anchor the narrative; however, the piece overreaches a multi-year breadth into a 4–6 sentence executive brief and mixes near-term catalysts with long-run regime logic in a way that blurs decision usefulness. Actionable edits: 1) compress to 4–6 crisp sentences (or bullets) that deliver a single house view with Regime A as base, Regime B as policy-misdesign risk, and Regime C as EV-transition downside, and include explicit probability weights (e.g., 50/30/20) tied to the macro regime map; 2) make the causal chain explicit and testable: AI displacement → unemployment risk → policy retraining/income safeguards → demand for durables → pricing in income/durable equities, with a short, numeric sensitivity (e.g., automation exposure ~25%; Brookings estimate; Ford Q2 EV losses ~$1.3B; dividend ~5%; Ford forward P/E ~8–11); 3) sharpen horizon treatment: separate near-term (0–3 weeks) catalysts from 3–6 month watch items, and attach each to a regime transition trigger (tariff moves, policy funding, EV ramp milestones); 4) fix conflicts and keep scope tight: drop or fold Alt 1/Alt 2 into the main scenario, treat the Las Vegas anecdote as illustrative only, and ensure every assertion ties to a cited ID; 5) elevate structure for an investor brief: a concise base-case paragraph, a 1–2 sentence catalyst/risk summary, and a 1-line near-term implication with a short watch-list (Jackson Hole, semiconductor capex cadence, tariff developments, oil prints, refrigerant-cost impulse); 6) enforce citation discipline and consistency: map each claim to one or more of NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, STBVARD8F, SGB2PAZGK, T1QE6JPIX, 0J41Q7KTX, U6HXAJR4J, LLN6N4H3Z, R3WNA7L7A and reconcile any numeric conflicts (e.g., Ford’s earnings metrics) before final drafting.",
