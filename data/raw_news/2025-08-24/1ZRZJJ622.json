  "title": "You\u2019ll Only Realize This Windows Setting Matters After It\u2019s Too Late",
  "description": "Lose your laptop without this feature, and you\u2019ll wish you had turned it on.",
  "content": "The scariest thing about laptop theft isn't losing the hardware\u2014it's that your unencrypted drive can be read on any computer. Windows has built-in protection for this. You just have to know where to find it.\n\nFor years, I avoided BitLocker like the plague. The fear of accidentally locking myself out of my own files kept me from enabling what's arguably Windows' most important security feature. And I wasn't alone in this thinking.\n\nThe horror stories I'd heard from people who lost all their data only made this fear worse. A BIOS update from your manufacturer can trigger BitLocker to demand a recovery key at boot. The TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip that stores your encryption configuration sees the BIOS change as a potential security threat. Without that recovery key, your data is as good as gone.\n\nMany people also believe they don't have anything worth protecting. But think about what's actually on your laptop\u2014synced text messages from your phone, that random note with your financial information, family photos and videos, saved passwords in your browser, and countless personal documents. If your laptop gets stolen, you'll likely lose more than just a computer.\n\nThe other genuine concern with encryption is performance impact. In my testing, the Samsung 970 EVO Plus 256GB showed about a 25% drop in sequential read speeds when encrypted (2747 MB/s vs. 3450 MB/s unencrypted), while sequential writes stayed nearly the same, closer to 2300 MB/s.\n\nRandom read performance also improved without encryption, which does translate into slightly quicker app launches and file loading. That said, the difference in everyday use is more subtle than the benchmarks suggest\u2014snappier here and there, but not a night-and-day change.\n\nWhy You Should Enable Device Encryption\n\nModern iPhone and Android phones automatically encrypt your data when you enable lock screen protection. Similarly, all Apple computers with T2 chips also offer automatic data encryption out of the box. The encryption on these devices feels so seamless that you probably never even noticed it was there. That's exactly how it should work\u2014protecting your data silently in the background while you go about your day.\n\nIf someone steals your unencrypted laptop, they can pop out the hard drive, connect it to another computer, and browse through your files as if they belonged to them. With encryption enabled, no one can use the drive without formatting it first, which would remove any and all data from it.\n\nSimilarly, selling or donating old computers becomes less risky when you know the data was encrypted. Even if you forgot to properly wipe the drive, the new owner can't access your old files without the encryption keys.\n\nIt's even more critical for businesses to encrypt devices that store sensitive information. A stolen laptop with unencrypted customer data can lead to massive lawsuits and destroyed reputations. But even for personal use, the peace of mind alone makes it worthwhile.\n\nIf you don't want to use Microsoft's built-in encryption or need more flexibility, there are excellent third-party encryption apps for Windows, like VeraCrypt, Boxcryptor, or Cryptomator. These work independently of your Windows account and can be accessed by mounting on any computer with just a passphrase.\n\nMicrosoft has been quietly enabling device encryption by default on new Windows 11 installations, regardless of how you set up your computer. Whether you sign in with a Microsoft account or create a local account using workarounds to bypass the internet requirement, encryption is turned on automatically.\n\nThe important difference lies in where your recovery key gets stored. With a Microsoft account, your recovery key is automatically saved to the cloud. But with a local account, the encryption remains in a suspended state, with the key stored only on your local drive. This way you're neither fully protected nor do you have a proper backup of your recovery key.\n\nTo complete the encryption process, you'll need to sign in with a Microsoft account, which then uploads the recovery key to the cloud.\n\nIf you recently bought a new computer or performed a clean Windows 11 installation, check your encryption status immediately. Open Settings > Privacy & security, then click Device encryption. If you see Device encryption is on, you're already protected.\n\nIf you see a yellow warning stating Sign in with your Microsoft account to finish encrypting the device, your encryption is incomplete. Click Sign in and log in to your Microsoft account to properly secure your system and backup your recovery key.\n\nThe encryption options available depend on your Windows edition and hardware. Windows 11 Home includes a lighter version of BitLocker known as Device Encryption, while Pro and Education editions offer full BitLocker with comprehensive management features and more control over your security settings.\n\nWindows 11 Home keeps things simple. If your computer supports it (most modern machines do), device encryption turns on automatically when you sign in with a Microsoft account on a new installation.\n\nIf you upgraded to Windows 11, you'll need to manually enable it in the Settings. Go to Settings > Privacy & security > Device encryption and toggle it on. That's it. Windows handles the rest automatically, including saving your recovery key to your Microsoft account.\n\nFor most people, this simplicity works quite well as long as you have access to your Microsoft account.\n\nBitLocker offers everything device encryption does, plus extensive management features. You can encrypt specific drives, use different authentication methods, and most importantly, choose multiple backup locations for your recovery keys from the start.\n\nTo enable BitLocker, click Start, type Manage BitLocker, and open it from the search result. Select your drive, click Turn on BitLocker, and enter a password when prompted. Windows will guide you through the setup, including the steps of backing up your recovery key.\n\nBitLocker also lets you encrypt external drives, which device encryption can't do. This is useful if you back up or save sensitive data to USB drives or external SSDs.\n\nHow to Save the Recovery Keys\n\nNow, the most crucial part of device encryption is safely backing up the recovery key. Your recovery key is the master key to your encrypted data; without it, you can't access your data if you cannot log in to your user account.\n\nWindows, by default, doesn't allow you to store your copy on the encrypted drive itself, which is good. Instead, save it to your Microsoft account.\n\nYou can locate your recovery key from your Microsoft account. Go to BitLocker recovery keys, and sign in to your Microsoft account. Now you can see all the recovery keys associated with your laptop.\n\nAdditionally, save a backup of the recovery key to your OneDrive personal vault if you have Microsoft 365, and a digital copy to a USB drive that you keep separate from your computer. Uploading a copy to your password manager will give you quick access to your recovery key on your phone when you need it.\n\nFor extra safety, include notes about which key belongs to which device. After a few years and multiple computers, those 48-digit recovery keys all start looking the same. Save each key by the device name you generated it on and the date. And don't forget that encrypting your backup data is just as important as encrypting your main drive.\n\nRemember to update your backed-up keys if you ever decrypt and re-encrypt your drive. The old keys won't work anymore, and you don't want to discover this during an emergency.\n\nDevice Encryption Protects Your Data, Even If Performance Takes a Hit\n\nYes, you need to be responsible about backing up your recovery keys. And there's a small chance you could lock yourself out if you're careless. But the consequences of not doing it can be far worse. Every other device you own already encrypts your data by default, so why leave your Windows PC to chance?\n\nIf you're worried about the performance impact, then test it yourself. Turn on device encryption if it's not already on and check the impact on your system performance. You can always decrypt from Settings > Privacy & security and toggle the switch to turn Device encryption off.",

      "text": "Encryption helps you cipher your data so that it remains inaccessible to others\u2014unless they enter a key or decryption password. And given the rise in online scams and malware, if you\u2019re a regular Windows user it\u2019s best to keep your data encrypted and add another layer of security.\nBut having to choose from an abundance of encryption apps can be paralyzing, and more often than not it\u2019s end in a wearied inaction. To cut down your search time, we went through a host of options and have listed down the best encryption tools for Windows.\n1. 7-Zip\nWhile 7-Zip has made its name as one of the best tools for compressing and decompressing your computer files, it does a fantastic job of encrypting them as well.\nFor this, it uses a 256-bit AES cipher, which you can enable for encrypting your files. When you encrypt the archive hierarchy with 7-Zip, you\u2019ll have to enter a password before you see the filenames contained within the archive.\nThe app is licensed under GNU LGPL, which means you can freely use the code base even in your propriety tool. However, making changes to the code base itself will require attributions in some form or another, and you will have to share the code as well.\nThe app is very straightforward. So, select your files, compress them into an archive, and then put the encryption with a strong password.\nDownload: 7-Zip (Free)\n2. VeraCrypt\nA lot of encryption tools borrow the closed-source encryption model of big tech companies. That means the data is, ultimately, at the whims of corporations or governments. For you, it means you\u2019re still not as secure as you might want.\nVeraCrypt is different. It has an open-source encryption algorithm, which means no company or government can force VeraCrypt to decrypt your files.\nOf course, there are a slew of other tiny features that caught our attention as well:\n- The app is cross-compatible and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n- You can encrypt complete partitions or storage devices such as a USB flash drive or even a hard drive.\n- Encryption will be automatic and real-time.\n- Provides a feature for plausible deniability: This means that you can easily deny you have the ability to decrypt files or folders, or that you have done any encryption at all. This is a handy feature that lets you off the hook if you're being forced to decrypt your data. To know more about these features, check out the Plausible Deniability page from the official VeraCrypt website.\nYou can, of course, get the app for free from the downloads page of the official website. All these features make VeraCrypt one of the best encryption tools for Windows.\nDownload: VeraCrypt (Free)\n3. Age\nAre you comfortable with a command line? Or maybe if you aren\u2019t for now, you\u2019re ready to get your hands dirty and learn the ins and outs of CMD? If so, we\u2019d recommend you give Age a go.\nAge is a modern file encryption format, tool, and Go library. It offers handy features such as a simple, text-based input interface (where you can put in your commands) and modern encryption powered by an XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption algorithm\u2014making it a force to be reckoned with.\nWhen it comes to password management, Age offers password-based encryption and decryption, as well as key management. So if you're looking for an encryption tool based on a command-line interface (CLI), Age is definitely worth checking out.\nDownload: Age (Free)\n4. Gpg4win\nExplicitly designed with Windows in mind, Gpg4win should be your software of choice if you\u2019re looking for something based on long-term, well-established standards.\nThe app helps you move your files and emails across different channels securely, all with the help of encryption and digital signatures.\nWhile the application of encryption is understandable, few know how vital digital signatures are as well. Simply put, they ensure your files are not transferred half-heartedly and appear with an official electronic stamp to ensure its integrity.\nSo, check out the free app and see if fits your requirements of encryption and security.\nDownload: Gpg4win (Free)\n5. BitLocker\nBitLocker is a disk-enabled encryption feature from Microsoft that lets you protect your data by providing helpful information. Perhaps the only drawback is that the feature is only available in Pro/Enterprise/Education versions of Windows.\nSo if you\u2019re using any of the above versions of Windows, you can use this feature and pick one of the two methods of encryption: hardware-based encryption using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip or software-based encryption using a password or USB flash drive.\nThe tool is available for free for the above-mentioned Windows versions. You can check out how to use BitLocker on Windows for a more in-depth guide.\nDownload: BitLocker (Free)\n6. Cryptomator\nIf you dabble in cloud computing a lot, Cryptomator should be the tool of choice for you. Regardless of what the cloud companies tell you, your data isn\u2019t completely safe when you\u2019re storing it on the cloud.\nTake the incident with LastPass in 2022, when hackers broke into LastPass\u2019s cloud storage and stole information about its users.\nBecause most cloud service providers encrypt data during transmission or keep these keys for themselves, it suffices to say that your data will be far from secure; in fact, these keys can be easily stolen, copied, or misused.\nWith Cryptomator, only you have the keys to decrypt the data. Cryptomator is also open-source, so the code base is openly available to everyone, and users can verify it and see that it does not have any backdoors.\nIt also receives periodic independent security audits from the open-source community\u2014the details are openly published on the official Cryptomator website. So if you're doing anything cloud-based, Cryptomator is one of the best encryption apps on Windows.\nDownloads: Crytpomator (Free)\n7. AxCrypt\nAxCrypt is a top encryption app on Windows that helps you keep your files secure. If you're someone who doesn't like to or have the time to learn all about encryption, the simple user interface of AxCrypt is just what you're looking for.\nHere are a few other features of the app that caught our attention:\n- Strong AES-256 encryption keeps your data secure.\n- Allows key sharing.\n- With the Mobile Encryption feature, you can also encrypt your Android or iOS from anywhere.\n- File wipe feature to delete your unencrypted files. Because of this feature, even recovery apps can't recover these deleted files.\nAll of these features make AxCrypt a nice addition to your encryption needs on Windows. The only drawback is the app doesn't offer a free version, but you can try out the one-month trial version and then make up your mind.\nDownload: AxCrypt (Free trial available, paid)\nThe Best Encryptions Apps for Your Windows PC\nEncryption, and cybersecurity in general, is no more just a passion for a select few hobbyists. With almost everything going digital, it\u2019s of utmost importance to keep up with the best cybersecurity practices; using an encryption app is one such practice.\nMake sure you go through the homepage of each app we've listed above for more information, then pick one and use it for a while. This will help you figure out what you need from your app much more quickly than simply reading about what apps to try."

      "text": "Your Android phone may seem entirely secure when it\u2019s locked, but that\u2019s not necessarily true. Unless you adjust the right settings, the lock screen can allow access to messages, controls, and even payment options\u2014all without unlocking the device.\n9 Use a Strong PIN\nSetting up fingerprint or face unlock is a great way to secure your Android phone. But the real lock that stands between your data and a stranger is your PIN. And if you're using something like \"0000,\" \"1212,\" or \"2580,\" that defense is paper-thin.\nThat's because anyone who would try to break into your phone knows all the usual suspects, from birth years and repeated digits to top-to-bottom patterns. Combine that with greasy fingerprint smudges that reveal the numbers you press most, and suddenly, guessing your code gets a lot easier.\nAn easy fix is to use a 6-digit PIN\u2014or better yet, a full alphanumeric password. This won't be a hassle since you'll use your fingerprint or face to unlock the phone most of the time. To set it up, head to Settings > Lock screen and AOD > Screen lock and biometrics and choose your preferred option.\n8 Set Auto-Lock to 30 Seconds\nIt's frustrating when your phone locks while you're in the middle of reading something, but increasing the auto-lock timer to avoid that isn't a great idea. If your phone's left unlocked and unattended, even briefly, someone won't need to break in. The door will already be wide open.\nTo close that window of opportunity, you can set your phone to auto-lock after 30 seconds of inactivity by heading to Settings > Display > Screen timeout. If you find this too short, some Android phones have a handy feature titled Keep screen on while viewing or similar, which uses the front camera to detect if you're looking at the screen. That way, the phone stays on when you need it, but not much longer.\n7 Avoid Using Smart Lock or Extend Lock\nSmart Lock (or Extend Lock) is a feature that keeps your phone unlocked when you're holding it, near a trusted location like home or work, or connected to a trusted Bluetooth device like your smartwatch or car. This way, you just need to swipe up on the lock screen to unlock the phone.\nBut there's an obvious problem: if someone gets their hands on your phone while Smart Lock is active\u2014say you're still in a \"trusted\" location or connected to your car\u2014they'll have full access without needing your PIN or biometrics.\nThat\u2019s a big risk, which is why it\u2019s best to turn off Smart Lock or Extend Lock entirely. To do that, head to Settings > Lock screen and AOD > Smart Lock (or Extend Lock), and disable all the options: Trusted places, Trusted devices, and On-body detection.\n6 Lock Down Quick Settings\nWhen you swipe down from the top of the lock screen, you get instant access to settings like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane Mode, and Location. That's convenient when you're in a hurry, but it also means a thief could quickly enable Airplane Mode to block tracking, or turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to stop remote reset tools from working.\nThey can even toggle off Location to prevent you from tracking your lost phone using Find My Device. To remove this vulnerability, head to Settings > Lock screen and AOD > Secure lock settings and turn on Lock network and security.\nOnce this setting is enabled, network-related toggles like Wi-Fi and Airplane Mode are locked behind your PIN or biometrics. You'll still have access to essentials like the flashlight, Do Not Disturb, and screen rotation, but nothing that could compromise security.\n5 Hide Lock Screen Notifications\nBeing able to glance at messages, emails, or alerts without unlocking your phone is convenient, but what if someone gets their hands on your device? They can see those same messages without needing to unlock it.\nThis means everything from private chats to one-time passwords (OTPs) for logging into accounts could be visible right on the lock screen. It's exactly the kind of information you don't want falling into the wrong hands.\nTo keep your lock screen notifications private, head to Settings > Lock screen > Notifications, then select Hide content. This setting will still show which app sent a notification, but it won\u2019t reveal what it says. Similarly, if you have any lock screen widgets that display sensitive information at a glance, it's best to remove those too.\nYou can also hide lock screen content on a per-app basis to keep sensitive content like messages or banking alerts private, while still showing reminders or calendar events.\n4 Require Unlock Before Using NFC\nNear Field Communication (NFC) is what makes contactless payments and quick device pairing possible. All you need to do is tap your phone on a terminal, and you're good to go. The problem, though, is that anyone could use your phone to do that.\nTo lock it down, enable the device unlock requirement for NFC transactions. On your phone, go to Settings > Connected devices > Connection preferences > NFC, and make sure Require device unlock for NFC is turned on. That way, even if someone gets hold of your phone, they won't be able to use it like a wallet without unlocking it first.\n3 Disable Voice Assistant Access on Lock Screen\nVoice assistants like Gemini or Bixby are super helpful. You can send messages, make calls, or check your calendar with just your voice, even without unlocking your phone. But since these assistants don't verify who's speaking, anyone can use them. With the right phrasing, someone could send texts or make phone calls on your behalf.\nTo disable this for Gemini, go to Google app settings > Gemini > Gemini on lock screen and turn off Use Gemini without unlocking. If you\u2019re using Bixby, visit Settings > Advanced features > Bixby and turn off Use while locked.\n2 Block USB Connections While Locked\nThe USB-C port on your Android phone has many purposes besides charging. And if your phone ends up in the wrong hands, someone could plug it into a computer to access your files, install malware, or even attempt to bypass the lock screen using specialized tools.\nTo ensure your phone is protected from such attacks, you can disable USB data transfer while your phone is locked. This ensures the USB connection is only used for charging and nothing else. To enable this, head to Settings > Security and privacy > More security settings and turn on Block USB connections while locked.\n1 Enable Auto Factory Reset\nIf someone's trying to break into your phone, chances are they'll keep guessing your PIN over and over. While most Android phones will delay access after a few wrong tries, a determined attacker with enough time could eventually crack it. That is, unless your phone is set to defend itself.\nThat\u2019s where the Auto Factory Reset feature comes in. When enabled, your phone will automatically erase all data after a set number of failed unlock attempts. It\u2019s like your phone pulling the plug on itself, rather than handing over your personal info to a stranger.\nTo turn this on, go to Settings > Lock screen and AOD > Secure lock settings and enable Auto factory reset. Make sure you back up your phone regularly so that if it ever erases itself from this function, you don't lose all your data along with it.\nMany of the lock screen features that add convenience can also leave your phone vulnerable. Taking a few minutes to adjust the above settings can go a long way in locking down your Android phone. The peace of mind you'll gain is well worth the effort."

      "text": "I've always been paranoid about PC security. But over the years, Windows has genuinely stepped up its game with some powerful protection features that most people overlook.\nThese security settings are sitting right there, unused. More importantly, cybercriminals are counting on you not to find them.\n4 Windows Sandbox\nKeeps Suspicious Files Away From Your System\nWindows Sandbox creates a completely isolated virtual environment where you can test suspicious files without risking your main system.\nWhen you download something sketchy, you can run it in the sandbox first. If it's malware, the damage stays contained and everything gets wiped clean when you're done.\nThis feature only works on Windows 10 Pro or Windows 11 Pro, though. If you're running the Home edition, you'll need to rely on free online sandboxing tools instead. Here's how to enable Windows Sandbox:\n- Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box, then type appwiz.cpl and hit Enter.\n- Click Turn Windows features on or off on the left.\n- Check the box next to Windows Sandbox.\n- Restart your computer when prompted.\nBesides that, there are other ways to enable and set up Windows Sandbox in Windows 11. Once enabled, you can launch Sandbox from the Start menu.\nIt boots up a clean version of Windows in seconds each time you open it. You can then download that email attachment, test a software, or click a suspicious link\u2014if something goes wrong, just close the Sandbox and the threat disappears.\nHow to Fix Windows Sandbox Not Working in Windows 11\nWindows Sandbox is a useful tool in any PC user's toolbox, but sometimes it needs some help getting started.\n3 Core Isolation\nStops Advanced Malware in Its Tracks\nCore Isolation uses your computer's hardware to create a secure barrier around Windows' most critical processes. The main component, Memory Integrity, prevents hackers from injecting malicious code into system memory, which is a favorite trick of advanced malware.\nThis feature utilizes virtualization-based security (VBS) to isolate sensitive operations from the rest of your system. Even if malware manages to infiltrate your computer, it can't tamper with protected kernel processes. Here's how to enable Memory Integrity:\n- Press Windows + I to open Settings, then navigate to Privacy & Security from the left sidebar.\n- Click Windows Security in the main panel and select Device Security.\n- Look for Core Isolation and then toggle on Memory Integrity.\n- Click Restart now when Windows prompts you to reboot your system.\nThe biggest advantage of Core Isolation is its ability to block kernel-level attacks that traditional antivirus software might miss. It works alongside your existing security software as part of Windows' built-in defense system.\nHowever, there are some downsides to consider. Older drivers might cause compatibility issues, and you could see slight performance drops in gaming or CPU-intensive applications. The feature also requires modern hardware with virtualization support, so older computers won't be able to use it.\nIf the Memory Integrity toggle appears grayed out, your system might need driver updates or BIOS changes. With Windows security getting better with such features, you don't need to install an antivirus on Windows 11, though that's debatable depending on your browsing habits.\n7 Ways to Fix the Memory Integrity Feature Grayed Out on Windows 11\nSometimes Windows 11 will complain that the memory integrity feature is disabled, despite not giving you a way to actually turn it on.\nThe performance impact is usually minimal on modern systems, but you might notice slight slowdowns in CPU-intensive tasks.\n2 App and Browser Control\nPrevents Dangerous Downloads\nApp and Browser Control is Windows' built-in web protection system that stops malicious downloads before they reach your PC. SmartScreen analyzes files, websites, and apps against Microsoft's threat database in real-time.\nThis feature works across multiple layers\u2014your browser, file downloads, and even Microsoft Store apps. When you try to download something suspicious, SmartScreen throws up a warning or blocks it entirely.\nMost people encounter SmartScreen when it blocks legitimate software with that \"Windows protected your PC\" message. The temptation is to disable it, but that's exactly what hackers hope you'll do. Here's how to configure App and Browser Control properly:\n- Open Windows Security through Settings > Privacy & Security > Windows Security.\n- Click App & browser control from the main dashboard.\n- Under Reputation-based protection, click Reputation-based protection settings.\n- Ensure that Check apps and files is turned on for download protection.\n- Enable SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge if you use the Edge browser.\n- Turn on Potentially unwanted app blocking to stop bundled software.\nThe \"Potentially unwanted app blocking\" setting is handy as it catches those sneaky toolbar installations and system optimizers that piggyback on legitimate downloads.\nSmartScreen isn't perfect, but it catches a surprising amount of malware that traditional antivirus programs miss. The cloud-based approach means protection updates happen instantly, not during scheduled definition updates.\nYou can temporarily bypass SmartScreen warnings for trusted software, but avoid making it a habit.\n1 Controlled Folder Access\nBlocks Ransomware\nThis security feature is Windows' answer to ransomware attacks. Controlled folder access creates a protective shield around your most important folders, such as documents, pictures, desktop, and others, preventing unauthorized apps from making changes.\nThis feature works on a whitelist principle. Only trusted applications can modify protected folders, while everything else gets blocked. When ransomware tries to encrypt your files, it hits a wall.\nRansomware typically targets user folders first because that's where your valuable data lives, but Controlled Folder Access stops this behavior cold. Here's how to enable it in Windows settings:\n- Open Windows Security through Settings > Privacy & Security > Windows Security.\n- Navigate to Virus & Threat Protection from the main menu.\n- Scroll down and click Manage ransomware protection.\n- Toggle Controlled folder access to On.\n- Then click Protected folders to see which directories are secured by default.\n- Use Allow an app through Controlled folder access to allowlist trusted programs.\nYou'll need to manually approve legitimate applications that want to access protected folders. This might seem annoying at first, but always enable ransomware protection on Windows as it's one of the most effective defenses against file-encrypting malware.\nThe feature monitors file system activity in real-time; hence, this approach doesn't rely on malware signatures. Some productivity apps might trigger false positives initially, but you can easily add them to the allowed list.\nRansomware Is Rampant in 2025: 6 Quick Tips That'll Protect Your Data\nThese security strategies can keep your data safe without requiring technical expertise.\nThese security features have been sitting in Windows all along. Taking just ten minutes to enable these protections could save you from a costly ransomware attack or malware infection. Your future self will definitely thank you later."

      "text": "Quick Links\nBacking up data is essential, but encrypting your files prevents unauthorized access. Encryption converts your files into unreadable data, ensuring that even if your backup is compromised, your sensitive information stays secure.\nWhy Backing Up Your Data Isn't Enough\nA backup gives you a copy of your files in case of hardware failure or accidental deletion. However, if that backup remains unencrypted, it becomes an open invitation for hackers and unauthorized users. Unprotected backups can expose sensitive data such as personal photos, financial records, or work documents to anyone who gains access.\nBy encrypting your data into a secure file, only those with the correct password or decryption key can unlock the contents of your backup. Furthermore, encryption isn\u2019t only about shielding data from other people. It also helps maintain privacy against unauthorized third-party access, including potential vulnerabilities in cloud storage services.\nThe bottom line is that while backups protect against data loss, encryption ensures that the backup itself does not become a security liability. So, start using encryption now and ensure you have more control over your privacy and security.\nHow to Encrypt Local Backups Easily\nImplementing encryption might sound daunting, but the process is often pretty straightforward. Here are a few easy ways you can start encrypting your backups right now.\nFor Windows Users: BitLocker\nWindows BitLocker is a great way to encrypt hard drives for local backups. Here\u2019s how you can encrypt your data:\n- Connect your external hard drive to your computer\n- Open the Control Panel, navigate to System and Security, and click on BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n- Choose your external drive and select Turn on BitLocker.\n- Give it a password when prompted.\n- You can store the recovery as a text file or save it with your Microsoft Account. I don\u2019t recommend printing your recovery key.\n- You will then be prompted to select an encryption mode. New encryption mode uses stronger encryption algorithms but can only be opened with Windows 10 or newer. Compatibility mode uses an older encryption algorithm but can work on older Windows systems.\n- Click Start encrypting.\nAfter the encryption, you\u2019ll notice that your external drive is marked with a lock symbol and can no longer be opened. Use your BitLocker password to open the drive. You can also use the recovery key if you forget your password.\nThis method will also work with other external storage drives like USB flash drives and SD cards.\nFor macOS Users: Disk Utility\nDisk Utility is a native macOS feature used to encrypt hard drives. It's also easy to use and supports external hard drives, USB flash storage, and SD cards.\n- Connect your external hard drive to your computer. Make sure the drive is empty since we\u2019ll need to format everything to add encryption to the drive. Only after encryption should you put your backup files in the drive.\n- Go to the Utilities folder and launch Disk Utility.\n- Reveal your external drives by clicking on View from the top left of the menu and selecting Show All Devices.\n- Select the drive you want to encrypt. Make sure that you\u2019ve highlighted the root of the drive and not the folder under the drive.\n- Click on Erase.\n- You\u2019ll be prompted to set up your drive. Give it a name, then select GUID Partition Map under Scheme to reveal the encryption options. Then select APFS (Case-sensitive, Encrypted) under Format.\n- Give it a password, then click on Choose. This will format your drive with encryption.\nRemember, you\u2019ll need to format the encryption on your drive before storing your backups on the device. Also, you won\u2019t be given a chance to recover your passwords. So, use the password hint option and save them on your Apple Keychain if you have one.\nFor Ubuntu and Similar Distributions: LUKS\nLUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) is a popular utility tool for encrypting files on Linux. Here's how to encrypt your drives using the terminal:\n-\nUbuntu has LUKS natively installed. In case you don\u2019t have it on your system, you can install the app by opening the terminal and using:\nsudo apt install cryptsetup\n-\nIdentify your drive with:\nThis will reveal all the recognized drives connected to your computer. Remember the location of your drive.lsblk\n-\nYou'll need to first unmount the drive to format it. You can unmount your drive by using:\nsudo umount /dev/sdd1\nChange /dev/sdd1 from the command to your specific drive location. -\nFormat the drive for encryption.\nAgain, you need to change /dev/sdd1 to your target drive location.sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1\n- Type YES in all caps when prompted, then give it a password.\n-\nTo open the encrypted drive, use the following command:\nYou can change my drive to any name you want.sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdd1 my drive\nLUKS offers an effective and transparent way to protect your Linux data. There is a GUI for LUKS known as luckyLUKS, but using the terminal is faster and more convenient.\nHow to Encrypt Files for Cloud Backups\nCloud storage provides convenience but also introduces risks if data is not pre-encrypted. Encrypting files before uploading them safeguards your data even in the event of a breach.\nEasiest Option: Zipping Files with Encryption\nUsing compressed archives with password protection is a quick method to secure files:\n- Choose the files you want to back up.\n- Use tools such as WinRAR (Windows), Keka (macOS), or 7-Zip (Linux) to create an encrypted archive. Simply choose the option to compress/zip/archive a file with a password.\n- Enable AES-256 encryption during the compression process if available.\n- Store the encrypted archive in your cloud backup.\nWhen using this method, it's important to set strong passwords to protect against brute force attacks. Though encryption keys using AES-256 are hard to crack, having a four-letter password won\u2019t take much time to break. Try using long passwords with different character combinations. Alternatively, you can use tools to help you generate strong passwords that are hard to crack.\nAdvanced Option: PGP\nFor those who require advanced security measures, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption provides a robust solution. It can help secure drives and files and even encrypt individual emails. There are different ways you can use PGP. One of the most popular ways is by using a GUI known as Kleopatra.\n- Download Kleopatra Gpg4win on your device.\n- Launch Kleopatra and create a New Key Pair. Give it a name and your email address, and tick the Protect the generated key with a passphrase option.\n- To encrypt your files, click on Sign/Encrypt at the top left of the menu. Select your file, then click on Sign/Encrypt at the bottom of the menu.\n- You\u2019ll then be prompted to give it a passphrase.\nTo open the PGP-encrypted file, right-click it, then open it with Kleopatra. Give the passphrase, then select where to store the unencrypted file. Though this requires a bit more setup, PGP provides better security as decryption keys are much more secure than plain text passwords.\nWhat to Do After Encrypting Your Backups\nWhile encrypting your backups makes your data safe from other people, it is still important to maintain the integrity and usability of your backups. Here are a few guidelines for you to follow:\n- Secure Your Encryption Keys: Store your passwords and encryption keys in a trusted password manager that supports multifactor authentication. Avoid writing your passwords/private keys on paper or unsecured digital files such as Sticky Notes if possible.\n- Regularly Check Your Local Drives: It is possible for data to be erased after a hard drive hasn\u2019t been powered for several years. Regularly powering and checking your drives ensures that they maintain enough charge to continue storing your data.\n- Keep Software Updated: Regularly update your encryption software and backup tools. Manufacturers frequently release patches and security enhancements to address possible problems.\n- Document Your Process: Maintain clear documentation of your encryption methods and backup procedures. Perform periodic restoration tests to confirm that your encryption and decryption processes work flawlessly. Since backups aren't meant to be opened often, it may be hard to remember where you placed your password or how to use the decryption tools to unlock your files.\nBy following these encryption practices, your backups will remain secure, and your sensitive data will stay private. Whether you use BitLocker, Disk Utility, LUKS, or cloud encryption methods, you can be confident that your files are well-protected."
