  "description": "Several cities, including Delray Beach and Key West, are fighting orders to remove rainbow crosswalks that show support of the LGBTQ+ community.",
  "content": "A culture war is raging in several Florida cities over the painting of crosswalks after the state covered up a rainbow mural in Orlando meant to honor the victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, sparking a battle between local, state and federal officials who\u2019ve said public roads are no place for \u201cpolitical banners.\u201d A rainbow crosswalk was removed overnight outside of Pulse nightclub in Orlando, one of the most significant LGBTQ sites in Florida, as part of state and federal transportation officials' aim to wipe \"political banners\" from public roadways.\n\nDepartment of Transportation earlier this month in what state officials called a crackdown on decorative street art that impacted more than a dozen enhanced intersections in Orlando. Protestors have re-colored the Pulse Memorial crosswalk several times since, and FDOT workers have followed behind them covering their work and on Friday installed new signs at the location reading \"Defacing Roadway Prohibited\" and \"No Impeding Traffic.\u201d One activist told a local news station that he was warned by Florida Highway Patrol troopers that he could be arrested and charged with criminal mischief if caught replacing the rainbow art again. Cities all over the state of Florida have been ordered to remove rainbow crosswalks, which for years have been installed in celebration of the LGBTQ+ community, with state officials citing noncompliance with traffic control guidelines as reasons for the others. Activists and elected officials, however, have called the move anti-LGBTQ+ after Republican Gov. Ron Desantis tweeted, \u201cWe will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes,\u201d backing up statements made by President Donald Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, who in July called rainbow crosswalks \"political banners.\u201d Many, including Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, have pointed out that the rainbow crosswalk was first installed in close coordination with the state and then-Republican Gov. Rick Scott, and that it adheres to national safety standards. Some Florida cities, like Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, have quietly complied with state orders to remove their rainbow crosswalks, the Palm Beach Post reported, while others, including Delray Beach and Key West, are fighting the directive and seeking legal clarification. Delray Beach will have an administrative hearing on Sept. 2 to discuss the removal of its downtown rainbow crosswalk, and Delray Beach has reportedly been ordered to remove its crosswalk by Sept. 3, with FDOT warning the city manager it will have state officials to the work and then bill the city if local authorities don't comply.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\n\u201cThis callous action of hastily removing part of a memorial to what was at the time our nation's largest mass shooting, without any supporting safety data or discussion, is a cruel political act,\" Dyer said, arguing that the crosswalk actually enhanced safety and visibility for pedestrians visiting the memorial.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nIf the state does the work itself. FDOT has the authority to order the removal of nonstandard street markings and can do the work at a city\u2019s expense if local officials refuse, the Post reports, but some cities are arguing that city-owned streets are under local jurisdiction and seeking legal clarification before erasing rainbow murals.\n\nDuffy on July 1 launched what he called the Safe Arterials for Everyone through Reliable Operations and Distraction-Reducing Strategies\u2014SAFE ROADS\u2014initiative. The program targets non-freeway arterial roads, where the Federal Highway Administration says more than half of U.S. roadway deaths occur, and calls to remove \"non-standard\" roadway markings, including rainbow crosswalks, from streets nationwide. The directive was issued via a letter to state governors. While the letter did not specifically mention rainbow crosswalks or politics, Duffy posted to X that, \"Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks. Political banners have no place on public roads.\"\n\nForty nine people were killed and another 53 wounded in June 2016 when a gunman opened fire at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. The victims were primarily LGBTQ+ and Latino. The shooting was later deemed a terrorist attack after the shooter swore allegiance to the leader of ISIS and was the largest terror attack in the U.S. since Sept. 11, 2001. Scott ordered 49 state flags be flown for 49 days in front of the Florida Historic Capitol in Tallahassee, and then-President Barack Obama called the shooting an \"act of hate.\"\n\nFlorida rainbow crosswalk controversy explained: Are they legal?

      "text": "Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy Urges Governors to Join National Initiative to Make Streets Safer, More EfficientPDF Version, 213KB July 1, 2025\nDear Governor: Safety is the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)\u2019s top priority. While I am encouraged that the estimates of traffic fatalities for 2024 continue a downward trend, by decreasing 3.8 percent from 2023, we still have more work to do to improve safety and mobility on our Nation\u2019s highways. In 2024, the estimated number was a stunning 39,345. This is unacceptable. I ask that you join DOT and support our national initiative, Safe Arterials for Everyone through Reliable Operations and Distraction-Reducing Strategies (SAFE ROADS), to help improve safety and mobility, eliminate distractions, and keep people and goods moving throughout the United States. DOT has strong partnerships with your State department of transportation (State DOT) to implement projects and achieve important national priorities, most notably safe mobility. The SAFE ROADS national initiative will focus on the non-freeway arterials within your State, including safety and operation at intersections and along segments, consistent and recognizable traffic control devices including crosswalk and intersection markings, and orderly use of the right\u2011of\u2011way that is kept free from distractions. These routes are where more than half of roadway fatalities in America occur and deserve enhanced attention. The goal of the SAFE ROADS national initiative is to partner with State and local governments to make the entire roadway right\u2011of\u2011way easier to interpret and navigate for all users, including pedestrians, vehicle operators, and automated vehicles alike. We ask that you ensure compliance with Federal statutes and regulations and accelerate the deployment of proven safety and operational solutions to make roads safer across America. We are getting back to the basics \u2013 using data to guide decision-making and prioritize investments that reduce distraction while improving mobility and safety for all road users. Within 60 days, I request that your State DOT, in coordination with your metropolitan planning organizations, use available safety data, analysis, and assessments to develop a list of arterial segments, including intersections, with the highest safety, operational, or compliance concerns that will be addressed by the end of Fiscal Year 2026. Please submit the list of locations to your Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Division Office. FHWA will track the progress of this important nationwide initiative and stands ready to support you and your State DOT as you develop your plans. FHWA offers technical resources to assist with road safety audits and assessments in selecting effective safety and operational countermeasures, accelerating implementation of improvements, and complying with Federal standards, such as those for traffic control devices and use of the roadway right-of-way. Please continue to inform your FHWA Division Office on progress as you take steps to address these locations. I look forward to meeting you at a future opportunity to learn about your success stories and best practices. With our shared goals of moving people and goods safely and efficiently, we can make the expectation that all Americans make it home safely and on-time a reality.\n|\nUnited States Department of Transportation - Federal Highway Administration |"

      "text": "An American-born man who\u2019d pledged allegiance to ISIS gunned down 49 people early Sunday at a gay nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest mass shooting in the United States and the nation\u2019s worst terror attack since 9/11, authorities said.\n* The gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, Florida, was interviewed by the FBI in 2013 and 2014 but was not found to be a threat, the FBI said.\nRelated coverage\n* Mateen called 911 during the attack to pledge allegiance to ISIS and mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers, according to a U.S. official.\n* Orlando police shot and killed Mateen.\n* Mateen\u2019s ex-wife said she thinks he was mentally ill.\nMateen carried an assault rifle and a pistol into the packed Pulse club about 2 a.m. Sunday and started shooting, killing 49 people and wounding at least 53, officials said.\nAfter a standoff of about three hours, while people trapped inside the club desperately called and messaged friends and relatives, police crashed into the building with an armored vehicle and stun grenades and killed Mateen.\n\u201cIt appears he was organized and well-prepared,\u201d Orlando Police Chief John Mina said early Sunday. Authorities said they haven\u2019t found any accomplices.\n\u2018An act of hate\u2019\nThere has been no claim of responsibility for the attack on jihadi forums, but ISIS sympathizers have reacted by praising the attack on pro-Islamic State forums.\n\u201cWe know enough to say this was an act of terror and act of hate,\u201d President Obama said in an address to the nation from the White House.\nWhile the violence could have hit any American community, \u201cThis is an especially heartbreaking day for our friends who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,\u201d he said.\nTimeline of Orlando nightclub shooting\nOmar Mir Seddique Mateen was born in 1986 in New York. Most recently he lived in Fort Pierce, about 120 miles southeast of Orlando. Fearing explosives, police evacuated about 200 people from the apartment complex where he lived while they looked through his residence for evidence.\nMateen\u2019s parents, who are from Afghanistan, said he\u2019d expressed outrage after seeing two men kiss in Miami, but they didn\u2019t consider him particularly religious and didn\u2019t know of any connection he had to ISIS.\nHe was married in 2009 to a woman originally from Uzbekistan, according to the marriage license, but he filed documents to end the marriage in 2011.\nSitora Yusufiy, interviewed by CNN in Boulder, Colorado, said she and Mateen were together about four months, though it took a long time to complete the divorce because they lived in different parts of the country after separating.\nMateen was a normal husband at the beginning of their marriage but started abusing her after a few months, she said. She said Mateen was bipolar, although he was not formally diagnosed. She also said Mateen had a history with steroids. He was religious but she said she doesn\u2019t think his religion played in to the attack.\nMateen had worked since 2007 as a security officer at G4S Secure Solutions, one of the world\u2019s largest private security companies.\nA message posted in Arabic on a dark web site associated with the ISIS news agency Amaq said \u201cthe armed attack that targeted a gay night club in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida and that bore more than a 100 killed and wounded was carried out by an Islamic state fighter.\u201d\nBut CNN\u2019s Salma Abdelaziz, who translated the message and closely monitors ISIS messaging, cautioned about taking the message at face value.\nShe said the language is inconsistent with previous ISIS announcements and that the Arabic word for gay was used rather than an epithet normally used by ISIS. Also, there was no claim that the attack was directed, just an after-the-fact claim the gunman was an ISIS fighter, she said.\nAt a Sunday afternoon news briefing, FBI Assistant Special Agent Ronald Hopper said the agency was aware of Mateen. The FBI interviewed him in 2013 and 2014 after he expressed sympathy for a suicide bomber, Hopper said.\n\u201cThose interviews turned out to be inconclusive, so there was nothing to keep the investigation going,\u201d Hopper said.\nMateen was not under investigation at the time of Sunday\u2019s shooting and was not under surveillance, Hopper said.\nIn the past two weeks Mateen legally purchased a Glock pistol and a long gun, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Trevor Velinor told reporters.\nIt\u2019s not known if those weapons were used in the attack.\n\u201cHe is not a prohibited person. They can legally walk into a gun dealership and acquire and purchase firearms. He did so. And he did so within the last week or so,\u201d Velinor said.\nScene inside the club\nPulse describes itself as \u201cthe hottest gay bar\u201d in the heart of Orlando. Hours before the shooting, the club urged partygoers to attend its \u201cLatin flavor\u201d event Saturday night. The club is a vast, open space that was hosting more than 300 patrons late Saturday and into Sunday morning.\nPeople inside the cavernous nightclub described a scene of panic made more confusing by the loud music and darkness.\n\u201cAt first it sounded like it was part of the show because there was an event going on and we were all having a good time,\u201d clubgoer Andy Moss said. \u201cBut once people started screaming and shots just keep ringing out, you know that it\u2019s not a show anymore.\u201d\nChristopher Hansen said he was getting a drink at the bar about 2 a.m. when he \u201cjust saw bodies going down.\u201d He heard gunshots, \u201cjust one after another after another.\u201d\nThe gunshots went on for so long that the shooting \u201ccould have lasted a whole song,\u201d he said.\nWhen the shots erupted, Hansen hit the ground, crawling on his elbows and knees, before he spotted a man who had been shot.\n\u201cI took my bandana off and shoved it in the hole in his back,\u201d Hansen said, adding that he saw another woman who appeared to be shot in the arm.\nOrlando nightclub shooting\nSurvivors provided CNN with dramatic accounts of how they avoided death. One person hiding in the bathroom covered herself with bodies to protect herself. Some entertainers hid in a dressing room when the shooting started and escaped the building by crawling out when police removed the air conditioning unit.\nOne of the bartenders said she hid under the glass bar.

      "text": "Florida rainbow crosswalk controversy explained: Are they legal? Why are they being removed?\nCities across Florida are grappling with FDOT orders to remove rainbow crosswalks, raising questions about legality, local authority and the symbolic meaning of these LGBTQ+ markers.\nRainbow-painted crosswalks in Florida have become flashpoints in a broader fight over visibility and authority. Once embraced as symbols of inclusion, they now face mounting pressure from the state.\nDelray Beach\u2019s downtown rainbow crosswalk has been spared for now after commissioners agreed to an administrative hearing on Sept. 2 in Orlando before complying with a state order to remove it.\nThe Federal Department of Transportation (FDOT) has ordered Delray Beach to remove the rainbow-painted crosswalk by Sept. 3, warning that if the city fails to act, state crews will do so themselves and bill the city for the cost. The letter, sent to City Manager Terrence Moore, also cited state law allowing FDOT to take \"any appropriate method necessary\" to erase the mural without further notice.\nThe debate has been unfolding for weeks, even as state crews in Orlando painted over the rainbow crosswalk at Pulse, the popular gay nightclub where 49 people were killed in 2016, following a state and federal directive to remove nonstandard street markings. Protesters briefly restored the mural with chalk before workers painted over it again.\nAcross Florida, questions linger about what these intersections mean, whether they are legal and if they will last.\nWhat is a rainbow crosswalk and what does it symbolize?\nA rainbow crosswalk is a pedestrian crossing painted in the rainbow colors of the LGBTQ+ Pride flag. These crosswalks are often installed to show support for LGBTQ+ residents and communities, and some, like the one near Pulse nightclub in Orlando, serve as memorials to honor lives lost to violence. The crosswalks also provide a visible marker of inclusion and have become locations where residents and visitors gather or take photos.\nAre rainbow crosswalks legal in Florida?\nThe legality of rainbow crosswalks in Florida is currently contested. FDOT has issued warnings that rainbow-colored or other nonstandard street markings on city streets violate state traffic guidelines. Some local governments argue that city-owned streets fall under their jurisdiction, not the state\u2019s. Legal challenges and administrative hearings are ongoing in several cities as officials weigh whether to comply with FDOT orders or contest them.\nWhy are Florida cities removing rainbow crosswalks?\nFlorida cities have been ordered to remove rainbow crosswalks following directives from FDOT, citing noncompliance with traffic control guidelines. Officials warn that failure to comply could result in state-mandated removal at the city\u2019s expense.\nThe agency frames the orders as part of a broader effort to ensure all street and crosswalk markings meet state and federal standards for color, visibility and design. Some cities, like Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, have removed their crosswalks, while others, including Delray Beach and Key West, are pursuing administrative hearings or legal clarification.\nWhich Florida cities still have rainbow crosswalks?\nSeveral Florida cities have retained rainbow crosswalks while awaiting clarification or formal enforcement notices. Delray Beach, Miami Beach, Key West and Fort Lauderdale are among the municipalities publicly discussing next steps or pursuing hearings. The status can change rapidly depending on state directives and local decisions.\nCan the state force cities to remove rainbow crosswalks on local streets?\nState agencies, including FDOT, can order the removal of nonstandard street markings, including rainbow crosswalks, and may carry out the work at a city\u2019s expense if officials do not comply. However, the state\u2019s authority over city-owned streets is legally contested, and some municipalities are challenging the orders through hearings or legal clarification.\nWhat is the current situation in Delray Beach?\nReacting to FDOT's removal of the Orlando crosswalk during the middle of the night, Delray officials say they will go to full lengths, including requesting police surveillance, to monitor the crosswalk ahead of the Sept. 2 administrative hearing.\nCurrently, the crosswalk is still intact at the intersection at Northeast 1st Street and Northeast 2nd Avenue, in the heart of the city's Pineapple Grove Arts District.\nPoll results: What was your take on the controversy?\nThe Palm Beach Post conducted an informal poll about where the public stands on the removal of rainbow-colored crosswalks in cities.\nHere are the results as of Wednesday, Aug. 27:\n- 53.18% (1,270 votes) said they should be removed.\n- 44.05% (1,052 votes) said they should stay.\n- 2.76% (66 votes) said the issue is more complex and there is no right or wrong.\nJasmine Fern\u00e1ndez is a journalist covering Delray Beach and Boca Raton for The Palm Beach Post.
