  "title": "I\u2019ve fallen in love with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\u2019s cover screen \u2013 and it might just become my main way to use a phone",
  "description": "Gorgeous and dripping with style, the cover screen aces the assignment",
  "content": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 might just reel me back into using a vertical-style flip phone. I used to count on the Galaxy Z Flip 5 before I got my S24 Ultra, finding the handset to be more than capable of keeping up with my daily needs while also offering an immense level of cool. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 keeps the cool factor going, with an exceptionally minimized crease and a cover display that I just can\u2019t help but love.\n\nIf you\u2019re not aware, the cover screen is an essential component of any foldable smartphone. It allows for functionality when the primary screen is inaccessible due to being closed like a clamshell. It can also be used to take selfies using the rear cameras, conveniently placed at the bottom of the cover screen, or top of the phone.\n\nNow, for a lot of foldables, the cover screen isn\u2019t feature rich \u2013 by default. To maintain a seamlessly premium feel, Samsung actively restricts how much a user can do with the screen to a handful of supported widgets and cover screen elements. It\u2019s not a bad idea and it keeps the level of polish to a high standard, but some folks, like me, may be left wanting to do more with the conveniently small screen. Thankfully Samsung has an easy solution to this \u2013 Multistar.\n\nMultistar isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s been around for several generations of the Galaxy Z Flip, but it\u2019s always been limited by how small the cover screen is. That\u2019s no longer an issue with the Galaxy Z Flip 7, with its cover screen spanning the entire top of the folded phone.\n\nMultistar is an essential piece of the puzzle. This official Samsung extension, accessible through the phone\u2019s cover screen settings and then downloaded from the Galaxy Store, allows you to put apps directly onto one of the widget menus of the cover screen, allowing you to swipe through Bluesky or even play games like Crossy Road.\n\nIt\u2019s not a complete solution \u2013 the screen doesn\u2019t display notification bar information, navigating between apps is extremely basic (limited to a single swipe up) and indeed some apps are still inaccessible, such as Samsung\u2019s own contacts and phone apps \u2013 but it does feel more useful than previous generations of the Flip, and I feel like I could sufficiently use much of my smartphone with just this small screen and my selected apps.\n\nBut is it worth the extra cost?\n\nAs much as I love the cover screen, its functionality, and the concept of a compact, square phone over a plain rectangle, it's hard to justify the higher price \u2013 especially with a more affordable option on the market.\n\nAlongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7, Samsung also released the Z Flip 7 FE, a cheaper handset with many of the same specs found in the Z Flip 6 \u2013 including its smaller cover screen that\u2019s capable of a lot of the same functionality. Similarly, I\u2019d recommend checking out Motorola\u2019s Razr range of foldable smartphones, as those can be used with similar utility when it comes to apps at a more accessible price.\n\nFor now though \u2013 I\u2019m a big fan of the funny little square I\u2019ve been using instead of a boring rectangle.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: which flip foldable is best?\n\u2022 Watch the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 go through a torturous durability test that I can't believe it survived\n\u2022 There\u2019s only one way folding phones can get thinner, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to ditch USB-C ports yet",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 actually delivers. It\u2019s easily the most stylish phone out there, no matter your color or material vice. It\u2019s also finally caught up to the big players with zippy performance, stellar battery life, and cameras that are no longer just an afterthought. That astonishing cover display seals the deal, making this phone more than the sum of its undeniably snazzy parts.\nPros\n- +\nExcellent performance and battery life that just won't quit\n- +\nFantastic new materials that make the design truly pop\n- +\nMore durable than you'd expect (hello, titanium!)\nCons\n- -\nThe priciest Razr ever\n- -\nNo zoom lens\n- -\nAI features occasionally dabble in unfortunate stereotypes\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025: Two-minute review\nI really dig the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 \u2013 this phone delights in ways other flat slabs simply can't. Using it with the cover display like a tiny, competent smartphone? Love it. The sheer satisfaction of snapping the phone shut to end a call \u2013 or my doom-scrolling session? Chef's kiss. The Razr Ultra makes every other phone feel like a boring rectangle. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s pretty great.\nWhat\u2019s your excuse for not owning a Motorola Razr? Cameras? Durability? Raw gaming power? Whatever your hesitation, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is here to gently overcome your doubts. This isn\u2019t just the best Razr ever; it's a genuinely remarkable mobile device.\nLet\u2019s get the sticker shock out of the way early: the Razr Ultra 2025 is more expensive than any previous Razr (yes, even that golden Dolce & Gabbana Razr V3i from the 90s). Starting at $1,299 / \u00a31,099.99, it\u2019s a cool $600 pricier than the base Razr 2025. That's a leap.\nHowever, more than any other phone in this lofty price bracket, the Motorola Razr Ultra earns every penny. Consider what you're getting:\nUpdate July 2025: I've been using the Razr Ultra a lot more, especially as I tested and reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7. While I liked Samsung's Flip, the Galaxy made me appreciate Motorola's simpler software and effective gestures even more, so I have raised the Software score. Also, the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor has proven to be vastly superior to competitors in performance and efficiency, so I have raised the Performance score as well. The Moto Razr Ultra is now a 9/10 phone, and my favorite flip phone that you can buy.\nA glorious 7-inch main display. That\u2019s one of the biggest screens you'll find on a non-tablet-style foldable. And it's not just big; our testing found that it's incredibly bright, and just as colorful as Moto claims.\nBut wait, there's more! The Razr Ultra's cover display isn't just for glancing at notifications. It\u2019s a bona fide second screen that ran every app I threw at it. Plus, it's bright, sharp, and boasts a silky-smooth 165Hz refresh rate. Yes, the Razr Ultra's bonus screen is faster than any iPhone display.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis year's Razr Ultra 2025 also finally packs a flagship-level chipset: the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, a processor that's been crushing it in every Android phone I've tested.\nThat powerful processor contributes to remarkable battery life. Despite its folding nature, the Razr Ultra packs enough juice to last all day, and even beat most competitors in our lab tests.\nEven the cameras are good this year! During my cloudy New York City review period, I pitted it against the iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S25 Ultra. The Razr Ultra 2025 held its own, with photos sometimes better, sometimes worse \u2013 the hallmark of a decent camera shootout.\nNeed more? The Razr Ultra boasts the most unique selection of materials and finishes around. My review unit is literally made of wood (responsibly sourced, no less).\nMy colleague at Tom's Guide has one in Alcantara, like a fancy sports car steering wheel. The Alcantara and faux suede devices are technically plastic, but they feel much more premium.\nThe best you'll get from Samsung and Apple? Glass or titanium. Oh, and speaking of titanium, this year's entire Razr family uses it to reinforce the hinge. Take that, boring slabs!\nThe Razr is catching on, and Motorola loves to talk about iPhone switchers. After a week with the Razr Ultra 2025, I'm surprised I'm not seeing more of these flip phones in the wild.\nDurability is a common concern, and it\u2019s a fair one. The Razr Ultra is the first foldable to use Gorilla Glass Ceramic on its cover display. And did I mention the titanium? It\u2019s also IP48 rated, meaning it can handle an unexpected dip, but dust remains its nemesis.\nI\u2019d love to say the Razr Ultra is bulletproof, but my first review sample had a screen hiccup within a day \u2013 it turned white intermittently, then fixed itself after a few days.\nMoto replaced it, and the second unit has been flawless. I'll chalk it up to a fluke for now, but reliability is a hurdle for foldables. That said, the folding mechanism feels incredibly solid, closing with a deeply satisfying clap.\nMore than anything, using the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 reminds me how refreshing a unique design and capabilities can be. Also, I adore hanging up on\u2026 well, everything.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Price and availability\n- $1,299 / \u00a31,099 for 512GB storage and 16GB RAM\n- No Australian pricing or availability announced yet\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is Motorola\u2019s priciest Razr, starting at $1,299 / \u00a31,099 / AU$TBC. A 1TB US model is an extra $200, but it's not available in the UK. We'll update this article with Australia pricing when we get it.\nYes, it's expensive \u2013 Galaxy S25 Ultra territory, and more than an iPhone 16 Pro Max. Only tablet-style foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 cost more.\nI'd argue that you get more bang for your buck with the Razr Ultra. The Galaxy Ultra gives you a stylus. Do you really need a stylus? The iPhone 16 Pro Max gives you\u2026 well, more iPhone. Both have more cameras, but that\u2019s about it.\nThe Razr gives you a huge, foldable display that vanishes into your pocket like magic, and a 4-inch cover display larger than the original iPhone's screen. It\u2019s genuinely two phones in one.\nYou also get a design with unmatched colors and materials. If natural titanium and moody blues are your jam, Apple and Samsung have you covered. For tactile wood and soft suede, Motorola is your dealer.\nA word to the wise: the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 was frequently on sale. Discounts, bundles, you name it. Right now, US buyers get a free storage upgrade to 1TB at launch. If you want to save some money, patience might be rewarded with a future deal.\n- Value score: 5/5\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Specs\nFinally, a Razr that\u2019s mostly flagship with few compromises. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is fast and efficient. The cameras are on a par with flat smartphones (though you only get two lenses). Even battery life is admirable.\nI wouldn\u2019t pay extra for 1TB of storage, and at launch, it's a free upgrade. My concern? Instead of price drops on the 512GB model, we might just see \"special deals\" offering the 1TB version at the 512GB price.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Row 0 - Cell 1 |\nDimensions: | Open: 73.99 x 171.48 x 7.29mm |\nWeight: | 199g |\nDisplay: | Main: 7-inch AMOLED |\nResolution: | Main: 2992x1224 |\nRefresh rate: | Main: 120Hz (165Hz game mode) |\nPeak brightness: | Main: 3,000 nits |\nCPU: | Snapdragon 8 Elite |\nRAM: | 16GB |\nStorage: | 512GB / 1TB |\nOS: | Android 15 |\nCameras: | Dual 50MP |\nSelfie Camera: | 50MP |\nBattery: | 4,700mAh |\nCharging: | 68W TurboPower charing |\nColors: | Alacantara, Wood, Leather-inspired |\n| Row 16 - Cell 0 | Row 16 - Cell 1 |\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Design\n- Excellent material options, including actual wood and Alcantara\n- There\u2019s a new button\u2026 for AI. You can mostly ignore it\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 looks almost identical to last year\u2019s Razr Plus 2024, but it's available in new materials and new Pantone-inspired colors: Mountain Trail (real, responsibly sourced wood!), Rio Red, Cabaret, and Scarab (Alcantara suede).\nNo other phone feels like this. Motorola has refined the Razr design to a peak.\nIt\u2019s not all sunshine and wood grain. There\u2019s a new button on the left side of the Razr Ultra 2025, and I\u2019ll give you one guess what\u2026 never mind. It\u2019s AI. It\u2019s a Moto AI button, and you can\u2019t reprogram it to do anything but open Moto AI features (or just to do nothing at all).\nTo be fair, you can tie Motorola\u2019s fascinating 'Pay Attention' feature to the button, and that intrigues me. I\u2019ll talk more about the AI features in the Software section below, but it really bugs me that there's a whole new button and it\u2019s just for AI.\nWhy? Because Google\u2019s Gemini AI already uses the power button on the other side! So, now there are two different AI buttons sitting on opposite sides of your Razr. Ugh.\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the crease, don\u2019t be. It never bothered me once. It\u2019s hardly visible, and easy to ignore. It may look dramatic if you\u2019ve never used a foldable phone, but it\u2019s actually quite smooth. When you look at the unfolded screen head-on, you won\u2019t see the crease at all.\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 in Pantone Rio Red\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 in Pantone Scarab\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 in Pantone Mountain Trail\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 in Pantone Cabaret\n- Design score: 3/5\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Display\n- Incredibly large man display folds into a surprisingly small package\n- The large cover screen is also fantastic\nThink of the Razr Ultra 2025 as a two-screen device, because the cover display is half the fun. Using it closed, interacting with just the 4-inch display, feels wonderfully clever and so convenient; I loved finding new ways to enjoy it. It became my Roku remote, my palm-sized hiking navigator via AllTrails, and my Slack monitor so I could keep my desktop less cluttered.\nThat 4-inch cover display isn't just capable with software; it's advanced, refreshing up to 165Hz! Overkill? Maybe. Awesome? Definitely.\nThe inner display is remarkable as well. It\u2019s a 7-inch, LTPO AMOLED panel that's Dolby Vision certified. The display is nearly the same size as the 6.9-inch screen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but the Galaxy is also a millimeter thicker and 20 grams heavier than the Razr.\nIn our Future Labs tests the Razr Ultra 2025 displayed a wider color gamut than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and it was just as bright. Samsung still doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision, so if you\u2019re a Netflix fan, that might give the Razr Ultra\u2019s display a leg up over Samsung\u2019s mightiest screen.\n- Display score: 4/5\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Software\n- Useful gestures to open the camera and turn on the torch\n- AI image generator can be... problematic, producing stereotypical and offensive results\nFirst, the good: Motorola\u2019s interface gestures are great. Twist your wrist for the camera \u2013 it's the fastest camera shortcut out there. Chop thrice for the flashlight. I use these constantly; so does every Moto fan I've met.\nNow, the AI. Motorola has also partnered with Perplexity AI. Perplexity is known to have trained its AI engine by ignoring the robots.txt page on media sites, a serious violation of web ethics. This allowed Perplexity to steal content freely, even content that was behind a paywall. I\u2019m not going to say more about Perplexity here, they don\u2019t deserve my support. Let's move on.\nMoto AI has some interesting tricks. \u2018Pay Attention\u2019 records and summarizes audio. It can record phone conversations, or it can just record you and your friends talking.\n\u2018Catch Me Up\u2019 summarizes notifications, though it was hit-or-miss in my testing, often ignoring texts or other key alerts.\nThen there\u2019s the AI image generator. Guardrails seem optional. You can generate images of copyrighted characters and realistic-looking humans. Ask for humans, and you will likely get offensive stereotypes.\nIf you ask for an image of a person of any nationality or ethnicity, and you'll get a picture of what a bigot might think that person looks like. Ask for a \"successful person\"? Expect white dudes in suits.\n- Software score: 3/5\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Cameras\n- Better than expected, occasionally even outshining the competition\n- Great macro mode helps compensate for the lack of a dedicated zoom lens\nCameras were always the Razr's Achilles heel, but the Ultra 2025\u2019s dual 50MP shooters are a huge step up. I was more impressed with its images than I have been with images from any previous flip phone.\nAI processing clearly helps. Compared to the iPhone 16 Pro, the Razr Ultra showed less noise and better detail in distant signs, though close inspection reveals some artificial sharpening. The end result is still pleasant. These aren't the best cameras, but they're very good. You're no longer sacrificing photo quality for that cool flip.\nIn fact, the Razr Ultra sometimes outperformed top camera phones. Its macro mode is excellent, capturing sharper, more vibrant low-light macros than the Pixel 9 Pro. Motorola seems to have borrowed Samsung\u2019s color tuning philosophy \u2013 photos are 'Pantone validated' to be vibrant, making my flower shots pop against dreary scenes. Photographers might prefer the iPhone's naturalism, but I liked the Razr's shareable, satisfying images.\nPlenty of modes are available, including Pro and a cool camcorder mode. The Photo Booth feature, using the folded phone as a stand, is perfect. There's room for improvement, but this Razr no longer feels like a camera compromise, especially for selfies using the main 50MP camera and cover display.\n- Camera score: 3/5\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Camera samples\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Performance\n- Excellent Snapdragon 8 Elite performance\n- Tons of RAM helps, but occasional lag during busy moments\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite continues its reign, with the Razr Ultra 2025 delivering impressive real-world performance and benchmark results.\nIt's great for gaming. Call of Duty Mobile ran maxed out with my Xbox controller connected, and Vampire Survivors was smooth with tons of enemies on screen.\nYou can game on the cover display. Vampire Survivors and Mighty Doom were playable, but CoD was illegible.\nBenchmarks put the Razr Ultra 2025 on a par with the OnePlus 13 (another Snapdragon 8 Elite, 16GB RAM phone), and slightly below the Galaxy S25 (which gets a slightly overclocked Snapdragon). You won't notice the difference.\nThe only lag I saw was with cloud-dependent AI features or when downloading multiple apps, where button presses sometimes became unresponsive.\n- Performance score: 5/5\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Battery\n- Excellent all-day battery life\n- Faster charging than most of the flagship competition\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 turned in impressive battery life. The phone had no trouble lasting all day in my weeklong review period, every day I used it.\nThe phone kept going whether I was using it for work, making video calls and using productivity apps, or using it for fun, taking photos and playing games on the train home. The Razr Ultra never quit before I went to bed.\nIn our Future Lab tests, the Razr Ultra is a top performer, lasting 18 hours and 30 minutes \u2013 just five minutes less than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which has a larger battery. Moto's power management is clearly on point.\nIt also charges at 68W, faster than many rivals at this price (the Galaxy S25 Ultra is 45W). With a compatible Motorola charger, you get nearly a full charge in 30 minutes, while the Galaxy Ultra hits around 70% in the same time.\n- Battery score: 5/5\nShould you buy the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The most expensive Razr, but also the first that doesn\u2019t compromise on flagship specs, from the processor to the cameras. The Razr Ultra gives you more than other phones this expensive. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent Razr design keeps getting better, with improved durability, more unique materials and color options, and a new titanium hinge. Not to mention the cover display. Forgive the AI button, there\u2019s still plenty to love if you ignore it. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | If the Razr Ultra only had the excellent 7-inch internal screen it would be great, but the 4-inch cover puts this phone in a class of its own. It\u2019s the only flip phone that is truly two phones in one. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | Motorola has a clean interface and useful software editions. I especially love the added gestures. Moto AI may have some promise and I like the \u2018Pay Attention\u2019 feature, but an offensive image generator spoils the party. | 3 / 5 |\nCamera | Much better cameras than you\u2019d expect on a flip phone, and I even liked some of the Razr Ultra\u2019s photos better than my iPhone\u2019s pics. It also excels at macro, which almost makes up for the lack of telescopic zoom. | 3 / 5 |\nPerformance | Excellent performance from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite inside. It\u2019s not the fastest you can find, but it keeps up with all the best flagship phones and it plays my favorite games at their highest settings with no trouble at all. | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | Surprisingly good battery life, as good as the Galaxy Ultra even though the battery is smaller. Fast charging makes it worth splurging on a faster Moto charger \u2013 this is a phone that doesn\u2019t want to miss the party, after all! | 5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want a phone that is actually stylish\nAre you tired of raw metal and phone colors that aren\u2019t colorful? Motorola is making phones stylish again, with faux suede and real wood.\nYou want two devices in one, a big phone and a compact\nSomehow the Moto Razr Ultra gives you one of the biggest displays on any smartphone along with one of the smallest, and both are quite capable.\nYou're really, really into AI and all the AI apps\nAI isn\u2019t my thing, but if you love AI, the Moto Razr puts AI tools front and center \u2013 literally, on the cover display, so you can talk to the robot without opening your phone.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou need serious zoom cameras\nIf your kid plays a sport or you love bird watching, you might want that extra reach to get better photos from far away. The Razr Ultra doesn\u2019t have it.\nYou want all the style but don\u2019t need the performance\nYou can get a stylish flip phone for much less if you don\u2019t care about performance or great cameras. The Razr 2025 is just over half the price of the Ultra.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025 review: Also consider\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nThe Razr Ultra 2025 might be great, but the king of smartphone heap is the Galaxy S25 Ultra, with the fastest performance, most versatile cameras, and so many features.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review\nMotorola Razr 2025\nYou don\u2019t sacrifice any style by choosing the less expensive Razr 2025, just the faster processor and better cameras.

      "url": "https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/ive-used-every-samsung-flagship-heres-why-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-one-of-the-best",
      "text": "I've used every Samsung flagship, here's why the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best\nDo you believe in magic? If not, you might want to try the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nIt\u2019s hard to overestimate just how incredible the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is in the glass and metal. It\u2019s not your average folding phone, and the in-hand wow factor far outweighs that of most flagship phones over the past few years, including many of the best folding phones.\nOver the past week, I\u2019ve shown Samsung\u2019s new folding phone to several people, and the response has been nearly uniform: 'wow, that\u2019s light'. Then I ask them to unfold it, and the response is even more surprising.\nAs I discovered while speaking with Blake Geiser, the SVP of Product Management at Samsung North America, the company set out with a core primary goal: to create a folding phone that felt like the Galaxy S25 Ultra when folded.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 nails this on the head, and most people are incredibly surprised when they first unfold it. I\u2019ve used every major Samsung Galaxy flagship launched since the first Galaxy S-series handset in 2010, and this is why the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of Samsung\u2019s best phones.\nThree design changes make all the difference\nSamsung is widely credited with launching the foldable phone market, at least in most global markets; however, sales of folding phones have somewhat stagnated as they faced a series of challenges that needed to be overcome.\nThe biggest of these was the size, and despite Samsung making its folding phones thinner and lighter each year, even the Galaxy Z Fold 6 was considerably thicker, bulkier, and heavier than Samsung\u2019s non-folding phones.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 immediately rectifies this: it\u2019s 4.2mm thick when unfolded, which allows it to be 8.9mm thick when folded. That\u2019s 0.7mm thicker than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, yet the Galaxy Z Fold 7 feels better, as it\u2019s 3.8mm narrower and three grams lighter. It\u2019s the sleekest Samsung phone ever made, and the nicest folding phone I\u2019ve ever felt in the hand.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOne of the biggest challenges for previous Samsung folding phones was the narrow front screen, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 cover display feels very similar to the regular Galaxy S25. It\u2019s significantly better than the Fold 6, and it makes the Fold 7 feel just like a normal phone that unfolds into a tablet.\nAnd create a genuine wow factor\nAll of this combines to create something that feels magical. I\u2019ve long wondered what it would take to persuade smartphone users to upgrade to a folding phone, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could be the device that finally prompts people to make the switch. It packs a ton of wow factor, and unlike its chief rivals, it\u2019ll be widely available globally.\nRivals like the Oppo Find N5 and Honor Magic V5 have a limited release, and although the latter is expected to launch globally in the coming months, it will still have fewer carrier and retail partnerships than the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This is a crucial fact, as it adds even more credence to the significant differences between the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy Z Fold 6; thankfully, Samsung has this covered.\nSmartphones don\u2019t change that often, and most years, we suggest that it\u2019s not worth upgrading from the most recent previous generation. This year, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 feels like a completely new phone that I think every phone user \u2014 folding or otherwise \u2014 should consider switching to. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen Samsung achieve this level of wow factor in years.\nAll the right big numbers\nDuring the early part of my career, I spent almost a decade working for carriers in the UK, and one thing is clear: big numbers sell, or specifically, the right big numbers.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 doesn\u2019t have the absolute best specs on a folding phone, but it has enough large numbers to persuade customers to buy it. Between advertising, Samsung\u2019s other marketing efforts, and word of mouth, it\u2019s arguably inevitable that many non-folding phone users will want to experience the Galaxy Z Fold 7 at least once.\nWhen they do, they\u2019ll likely ask about the key numbers involved, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 hits most of these, even though it lags behind the competition in many areas. A triple camera with a headline 200-megapixel sensor \u2014 that\u2019s ostensibly the same as the one found in the lauded Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2014 will get any customer\u2019s attention. The camera is better than I expected, and should prove to be good enough for most people, as long as they don\u2019t want to capture photos at long focal lengths.\nThe 4,400mAh battery and 25W charging aren\u2019t world-beating \u2014 in fact, they\u2019re lower than all the key rivals \u2014 but sound big enough for someone switching from a Galaxy S25 Plus or iPhone 16 Pro. In actual practice, it\u2019s a full day of usage with very little to spare, but considering most people sit at a desk, or plug in to charge while in the car, I think it\u2019ll be passable, but barely.\nEven the chip hits the right note, albeit with one big caveat. It\u2019s the same Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset used in Samsung\u2019s other flagship phones this year, at least on paper. In actual practice, the silicon feels throttled compared to Samsung\u2019s other flagships, and performs similarly to the also ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Edge.\nThere will undoubtedly be doubts about the longevity of the Galaxy Z Fold 7's battery, which is understandable, but I suspect that the design and wow factor are special enough for customers to accept certain shortcomings. It doesn\u2019t have the best battery life, but I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s sufficient for most people, even if it falls short of rival folding phones.\nThe ultra-thin foldable we\u2019ve been waiting for\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 is an engineering marvel simply for how fantastic it feels. When I first held it at a Galaxy Unpacked preview event, I was blown away by how thin, light, and sleek it felt. I had my reservations, but I\u2019ve wondered if my initial reaction was reflective of an average user or someone who has a passion for folding phones.\nTo answer this, I\u2019ve shown the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to many different people, and it\u2019s reaffirmed what I thought at first: this is one of the most special folding phones ever made \u2014 a case in point is my mother. She won\u2019t consider the Galaxy S25 Ultra because it\u2019s too big, but she wants a great camera. She uses a Galaxy S22 Plus and refuses to switch to an iPhone.\nI showed my mother the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and she was floored by its design. She\u2019s so impressed that she\u2019s heavily considering buying it. This was the biggest surprise, as I had shown her other folding phones \u2014 like the Find N5 and the Magic V3 \u2014 and this was the first folding phone she was willing to consider.\nIf it can appeal to someone resistant to technology change, like my mother, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will surely appeal to the masses more than any other folding phone before it. Could this finally be the folding phone industry\u2019s iPhone moment, or will that need to wait for next year\u2019s rumored iPhone Fold or this year's rumored Samsung tri-fold? Either way, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is shaping up to be the best foldable yet.\nYou may like\n- The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a major step forward for Samsung, but Oppo and Honor are still ahead in the foldable race\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: price, cameras, upgrades, and everything you need to know\n- Samsung explains why the Galaxy Z Fold 7 doesn't have a bigger battery, but its reason isn't entirely convincing\nNirave is a veteran tech journalist and creator at House of Tech.

      "text": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 fixes my biggest complaint, but I'd still never buy one \u2013 here's why\nCover all bases\nSamsung has revealed the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the next generation of its iconic Z Fold folding phone series and successor to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which we list as one of the leading folding phones money can buy.\nThough the Galaxy Z Fold 7 won\u2019t ship until July 25, I briefly got to try the new foldable at a Samsung pop-up in London \u2013 and having held the phone in my own hands, I have to say I\u2019m very, very impressed with its construction. Samsung has done a wonderful job in making a phone that both looks better and feels like a more natural choice for an everyday carry.\nAs our hands-on Galaxy Z Fold 7 review notes, Samsung\u2019s latest foldable measures just 4.2mm thick when unfolded, with an 8-inch folding main display and 6.5-inch cover screen.\nIn addition to being razor thin, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 fixes an issue with the Z Fold series that\u2019s bugged me for years, and even stopped me from considering buying one in the past.\nA cover screen worth celebrating\nI\u2019m talking about the cover screen \u2013 specifically how slim and tall it is. I\u2019ve always felt that the cover screen on the Galaxy Z Fold line is far too skinny to comfortably use.\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of display size, either \u2013 the Galaxy Z Fold 6 sports a 6.3-inch display, but because of the dimensions of the inner display this has to occupy a 22:9 aspect ratio. For reference, the industry standard for slab phones is currently 19.5:9 \u2013 still tall, but much wider in-hand than the Galaxy Z Fold 6.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 fixes this issue. Not only is the cover screen larger at 6.5 inches, it\u2019s got a new aspect ratio of 21:9 \u2013 not far off the Galaxy Z Fold 6\u2019s 22:9 display, but enough of a change to instantly feel more useful, familiar, and inviting.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt might seem odd make such a stand about the cover display of a folding phone \u2013 after all, you\u2019re likely buying it for the large inner folding display. But having used a handful of folding phones, I can say with confidence that the cover display is key if a phone maker wants its handset to rank amidst the best folding phones.\nLike it or not, there will be times when you need to use your phone one-handed, or discreetly, or quickly \u2013 and in these moments having a properly useful cover screen is important. And to be frank, with the high price of folding phones, it's reasonable to expect a great experience from one at all times.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 nails this crucial feature \u2013 I can tell you that much just from my few minutes with it. I\u2019d go so far as to say Samsung has produced a truly stunning piece of hardware.\nNonetheless, I still won\u2019t be buying one, for a pretty simple reason: price.\nPerturbing price\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 will retail for $1,999 / \u00a31,799 / AU$2,899. That\u2019s the most expensive starting price I\u2019ve ever seen for a widely released phone, and a single US dollar away from $2,000\nI don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m not dropping two grand on a phone, even if it's a beautifully built and profoundly capable handset. I\u2019m sure there are people who are ready to part with this much money for the Galaxy Z Fold 7*, but I\u2019m not one of them (*do keep an eye on our phone deals coverage for the latest discounts and trade-in offers).\nLooking just at the US pricing, for $1,999 you could buy two Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus handsets, four PS5 Slim consoles or seven Apple Watch SEs. That is a lot of buying power to give up for a single device, and too much for me to consider purchasing \u2013 though do keep an eye out for our upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 review for a more detailed perspective backed by real-world testing.\nAdmittedly, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 didn\u2019t cost much less at launch, with a price tag of $1,899 / \u00a31,799 / AU$2,749.\nAs for its rivals, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 / \u00a31,749 / AU$2,699, and the OnePlus Open launched (in 2023) at $1,699 / \u00a31,599. Whether by Samsung\u2019s standards, or those of its rivals, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a significant step up in price.\nSo, brilliant job Samsung, but I\u2019m still not buying a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. What do you think \u2013 is the Galaxy Z Fold 7 too expensive? Or does the new design justify the price?

      "text": "Always a bridesmaid, never the bride. That\u2019s been my impression of the Galaxy Z Flip series ever since the original Samsung Galaxy Fold debuted in 2020.\nIt\u2019s never quite had the same je ne sais quoi as the pricier, more premium-feeling Galaxy Fold series, and in recent years, rival flip phones like the Motorola Razr Ultra have eaten into what little wow factor the Z Flip series still had among the best foldable phones.\nThat all changes with the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Not only did I walk away from my pre-Unacked hands-on session feeling almost as excited about Samsung\u2019s latest Flip phone as I am about its newest Fold, but I\u2019m also convinced that Samsung has addressed my biggest concern with Flips of the past: yes, people, the cover screen is now as good as anything you\u2019ll find on the best Motorola phones.\nOkay, let\u2019s dial back. I\u2019ve only spent an hour with the Galaxy Z Flip 7, so it\u2019s not fair to make such a bold claim quite yet, but Samsung has certainly gone to town on the new phone\u2019s cover display in a way that it simply hasn\u2019t with previous Flip models.\nThe FlexWindow (as Samsung calls it) now measures 4.1 inches, up from a paltry 3.4 inches on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. This increase is much more significant than it reads on paper, not least because the Z Flip 7\u2019s cover display now wraps around its two rear camera rings (finally!).\nThe refresh rate on the FlexWindow has also been doubled from 60Hz to 120Hz, and the bezels are now much slimmer than before. They\u2019re so slim, in fact, that the cover display on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 at least looks more impressive than that of the Motorola Razr Ultra (I\u2019m a little hesitant to call it better outright, having not yet tested the messaging or pattern-unlocking experience on Samsung\u2019s newest display).\nAll of this extra cover-screen real estate means the Z Flip 7 is a lot more usable when closed. You can access the Now Bar and even Gemini Live straight from the FlexWindow, and there are plenty of new camera features to try, too, including Auto Framing, which adjusts the field of view to keep your subject in focus within the frame, and Real-Time Filters, which let you sample different photographic styles directly from the FlexWindow.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe upgrades continue on the inside. Opening up the Galaxy Z Flip 7, you\u2019ll find a bigger, wider 6.9-inch display, which makes the phone feel more like a Galaxy S25 Ultra and less like an oddly-shaped foldable in the hand. If not for Flip\u2019s chunkier internal display bezels, you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell the difference between the two devices on a flat surface.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 measures 13.7mm when folded and 6.5mm when unfolded, which is still pretty chunky as foldables go (the Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures an incredible 4.2 mm), but that\u2019s a sizable reduction in thickness versus the Galaxy Z Flip 6.\nWhat\u2019s more, despite this thinner frame, Samsung has managed to pack a larger, 4,300mAh battery into the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and that, paired with the new, efficiency-focused Exynos 2500 chipset, should ensure that Samsung\u2019s latest Flip phone delivers the longest-ever battery life for a Z Flip model (we managed 11 hours in our testing of the Galaxy Z Flip 6).\nIt\u2019s a similar story for durability. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 still has the same IP48 resistance rating as its predecessor, but because of those thinner bezels on its cover screen, Samsung says it\u2019s managed to achieve tighter waterproofing on the phone\u2019s circuitry. The new Armor FlexHinge is also thinner and more durable than the equivalent hinge on the Z Flip 6.\nThe only real disappointment with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is its unchanged camera array. It gets a 50MP wide lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 10MP selfie camera \u2013 that\u2019s the same as the offering on the Z Flip 6. The few snaps I took with each of these lenses were perfectly fine, but the Flip 7 isn\u2019t going to make a dent in our list of the best camera phones.\nMind you, if Samsung had to choose between offering a bigger, more usable cover screen and a display-eating (but photography-enhancing) rear camera module on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s prioritized the former. That\u2019s what this new phone is all about \u2013 bigger, better displays, and the Flip series no longer feels one step behind the competition thanks to these major design changes.\nAs for pricing, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 costs the same as the Galaxy Z Flip 6 in every region \u2013 specifically $1,099 / \u00a31,049 / AU$1,799 for the 256GB model and $1,219 / \u00a31,149 / AU$1,999 for the 512GB model (we\u2019re awaiting confirmation on Australia pricing). It\u2019s available to pre-order now in a choice of Blue Shadow, Jetblack, and Coral, with general availability beginning on July 25.\nWe\u2019re currently putting the Galaxy Z Flip 7 through its paces in our testing labs, so stay tuned for our full verdict, including our thoughts on its value for money.

      "text": "Early Verdict\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE should have been cheaper and more colorful, but instead we get a basic black and white version of last year's Flip 6 with only 8GB of RAM instead of 12GB. It's cheaper than last year's Flip, but the Motorola Razr is a huge bargain in comparison, with bright colors and a better cover screen.\nPros\n- +\nActually much cheaper than a Flip 6\n- +\nKeeps the Flip 7's 50MP camera\nCons\n- -\nCosts much too much\n- -\nNo cool colors like other FE devices\n- -\nBasically last year's phone with less RAM\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe day was a real cooker as I approached the Brooklyn Navy Yard, site of the Samsung Unpacked event that would feature the new Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and the latest addition to the foldable family, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.\nI\u2019d heard whispers about the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE; rumblings from the street, you might say. We knew it would be a cheaper version of the Galaxy Z Flip 7, but how was Samsung going to pull it off? What corners would be cut? What features would get left out in the cold?\nI couldn\u2019t concentrate on cold; it was too hot outside. I waited through the Galaxy Z Fold 7 announcement. Did the suit on stage really misspeak and say it would cost $199.99? I guess some prices are too high even for Samsung\u2019s own people to swallow.\nI sat through the Galaxy Z Flip 7 announcement, thinking I\u2019d made a huge mistake. I put my partners on the trail of the Flip 7 and the even more expensive Fold 7. I figured my time slumming it with Motorola\u2019s base model Razr would make me the right gumshoe to sniff out the details on the cheap new Flip FE.\nThen I saw the bezel on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover display and I felt the green monster \u2014 jealousy \u2014 breathing down my neck.\nFine, I thought, you can\u2019t have every phone. Sometimes you have to let the good ones go if it means saving a buck or two. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 has looks, sure, but those come at a high price: $1,099.99. That\u2019s too rich for my blood.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE: price and specs\n- Starts at $899 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,499 for 8GB RAM / 128GB storage\n- Cheaper than Galaxy Z Flip 6, but still very pricey\nFinally, the moment of truth arrived. The Samsung rep faked a retreat then stepped back to the front of the stage with that old chestnut: and one more thing\u2026 it was the Galaxy 7 Flip FE. My quarry. I finally had my eyes on the prize. But what exactly was I seeing?\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSamsung laid it out in black and white \u2013 literally. That was the first thing I noticed about the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. It came in black or white. Shiny, glossy, like 88 ivories ready to be played. No other colors.\nI grabbed my notebook. This couldn\u2019t be right, could it? For a Galaxy FE? I flipped back a few months to the Galaxy Tab S10 FE, Samsung\u2019s iPad Air competitor. Didn\u2019t that tablet come in blue? The blood drained from my head. The room started to go dark.\nI flipped back even further to the Galaxy S24 FE. Mint! I have it in mint, and I know there was a blue. Was this a dream? Some sawbones once told me that dreams are often in black and white, but I don\u2019t pay much attention to doctors.\nWhy would the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE be available only in black and white? I may have a long memory for Samsung\u2019s favorite hues, but Samsung only has its eye on one dame\u2026 the Apple iPhone 16e.\nSamsung used to show up at the bargain table wearing bright colors like it was Easter Sunday. Then Apple reminded the world that every day can be a funeral, and the iPhone 16e launched in black and white \u2013 the first monochromatic iPhone I can recall since the iPhone 3GS.\nIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say that\u2019s why Samsung changed its FE look. I would also guess that the overpriced iPhone 16e is the reason Samsung priced the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE like a premium flagship, not a bargain phone. The Flip 7 FE will start at $899.99. I gasped when Samsung flashed the number.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE | Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 | Motorola Razr 2025 |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice at launch: | $899 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,499 | $1,099.99 / \u00a31,049 / AU$1,799 | $699.99 / \u00a3799.99 / AU$1,199 |\nDimensions (folded): | 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm | 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm | 88.1 x 74 x 15.9 |\nDimensions (unfolded): | 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm | 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm | 171.3 x 74 x 7.3mm |\nWeight: | 187g | 187g | 188g |\nMain display: | 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1080 x 2640), 120Hz refresh rate, 2,600 nits peak brightness | 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1080 x 2640), 120Hz refresh rate, 2,600 nits peak brightness | 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED (1080 x 2640), 1-120Hz refresh rate, 3,000 nits peak brightness |\nCover display:: | 3.4-inch Super AMOLED (720 x 748), 60Hz refresh rate, 2,600 nits peak brightness | 3.4-inch Super AMOLED (720 x 748), 60Hz refresh rate, 1,600 nits peak brightness | 3.6-inch AMOLED (1056 x 1066), 90Hz refresh rate, 1,700 nits peak brightness |\nChipset: | Samsung Exynos 2400 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy | Mediatek Dimensity 7400X |\nRAM: | 8GB | 12GB | 8GB |\nStorage: | 128GB / 256GB / 512GB | 128GB / 256GB / 512GB | 256GB / 512GB |\nOS: | Android 16 / OneUI 8 | Android 15 / OneUI 7 | Android 15 |\nPrimary camera: | 50MP f/1.8 | 50MP f/1.8 | 50MP f/1.7 |\nUltrawide camera: | 12MP f2.2 | 12MP f2.2 | 13MP f/2.2 |\nInner Camera | 10MP f2.2 | 10MP f/2.2 | 32MP f/2.4 |\nBattery: | 4,000 mAh | 4,000 mAh | 4,500 mAh |\nCharging: | 25W wired, 15W wireless | 25W wired, 15W wireless | 30W wired, 15W wireless |\nColors: | White, Black | Yellow, Silver Shadow, Mint, Blue, Black, White, Peach | Pantone's Gibraltar Sea, Spring Bud, Lightest Sky, Parfait Pink |\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE: design\n- Same dimensions and weight as Galaxy Z Flip 6\n- Only comes in black and white\nI headed to the hands-on tables and sidled up next to Lance, who was parked in front of the gorgeous, mint green Galaxy Z Fold 7. The room was filled with tables and shmoes like me, looking for a scoop.\nAll I saw were bright colors, but my target had none of that. I was looking for the colorless suspect in the center of it all: the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.\nThe massive warehouse was decked out in more color than I could comprehend. There was bright graffiti covering one corner. OLED TVs showed off Samsung\u2019s commitment to ecology in bright green and poison-dart frog orange.\nAfter a tour of the gigantic space, I found my FE back near where I started. There were three on a table: two black and one white. These were the only Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE phones in the room.\nClearly, Samsung didn't expect a big crowd for its so-called bargain.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE: display\n- You'll be jealous when you see the Flip 7's cover display\n- Inner screen is large but not as big as a Moto Razr or Flip 7\nFrankly, I don't blame them. It's hard to work up a sweat over a cheap phone that costs $900, even on a hot day like today. With a good sale happening, I can get two Motorola Razr phones for the same price \u2013 one for work and another for the weekend.\nAfter a few minutes with the Flip 7 FE I\u2019m onto Samsung\u2019s jig. The FE is the exact same size and weight as the Galaxy Z Flip 6. It\u2019s got the same screens, inside and out, down to the pixel.\nTo be fair, the Flip 7 FE can get brighter, but that\u2019s according to Samsung. I\u2019ll let my folks in Future Labs run tests at the clubhouse before I declare this phone the winner.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE almost seems designed to disappoint. No colors. No big cover screen. No Snapdragon inside \u2013 this phone runs on the Exynos 2400 that flummoxed Galaxy S24 buyers who weren't in the US. It even has less RAM than the Galaxy Z Flip 7: eight gigabytes instead of 12.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE: cameras\n- 50MP main camera, 12MP ultra wide\n- Same camera specs as Galaxy Z Flip 7 (and Flip 6)\nI check out the cameras \u2013 not bad? At least it keeps the same shooters as the normal Flip7. There\u2019s a 50MP wide cam that\u2019s a solid option for selfies, and I can see my kisser in the cover screen with the Flip 7 FE closed.\nAt least the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE doesn't seem to be a downgrade in that department. I'll need to take it for a spin to be sure, but the cameras look identical to what the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is packing.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE: final word\nWhy not just keep the Galaxy Z Flip 6 around at a discount? Samsung feeds me a line and I chew on it, but I don't swallow. It said the Z Flip 6 couldn't run DeX, but the Exynos in the Z Flip 7 will make it happen. A likely story, since the Flip 6 and the Galaxy S24 had the same chips.\nBut what about the Flip 7 FE? It's unclear what it can and can't do.\nI can't imagine anyone picking the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE over a Galaxy Z Flip 7, except by accident. I'll need to spend some quality time with this phone before I can write its full review story, but my gut tells me if last year's phone gets a discount, steer folks toward an older, more colorful Flip 6 before sending them after this black-and-white 'bargain.'\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

      "text": "Watch the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 go through a torturous durability test that I can't believe it survived\nBruised but not defeated\n- Samsung's Flip 7 went through an extreme durability test\n- Its outer screen is hardy, but the inner screen is easily scratched and burnt\n- It couldn't be snapped in half by hand, however\nOur phone testing is very rigorous, but we focus on what a regular person would get out of the gadget and if it\u2019s better or worse than the competition at the same price; we don\u2019t routinely set fire to phone screens, bathe gadgets in dirt, or attempt to scratch every surface with a knife \u2013 but that\u2019s what one tester has done to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7.\nIn an extreme durability test, which you\u2019ll find several of on his YouTube channel, JerryRigEverything seriously put Samsung\u2019s new foldable through its paces \u2013 a follow-up to a similar video involving the Galaxy Z Fold 7 about a week earlier.\nIn the just under 9-minute video, Samsung\u2019s phone is tortured, but we do learn some useful details.\nThe outer screen is pretty hardy, standing up to significantly harder materials than the inner screen \u2013 which a particularly forceful fingernail scratch is able to create grooves in \u2013 and also withstanding direct heat from a lighter\u2019s flame. The inner screen is left with a couple of permanent green damage marks after about 15 seconds of fire exposure.\nIt then gets drenched in dirt, including getting a healthy heaping dropped straight into its hinge. Opening and closing the phone with dirt covered did allow some soil to enter the mechanism \u2013 you can hear it crunch when opening and closing after the fact \u2013 but at least during the video, no other permanent harm is noticeable.\nLastly, JerryRigEverything does his best to snap the phone in half with his hands, but it survives his attempts.\nYou should absolutely go watch the full video \u2013 especially if, like me, you\u2019re too cautious with your tech to let the intrusive thoughts win \u2013 because it highlights the extreme lengths you have to go to actually tear these foldables apart.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nTougher than you think\nI\u2019ve used a foldable as my daily driver for about a year. I started with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and recently upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nBecause I get those phones through my job, I\u2019m admittedly a bit more laissez-faire with how I treat them (meaning I\u2019ll buy a cheap screen protector, but not a case), but both phones have been holding up very, very well.\nThe Z Fold 6 has a few bruises at the edges, but nothing serious, and my Z Fold 7 is close to immaculate. Neither has any issues with their hinges, and while you can see their creases, it\u2019s not super noticeable on either phone when you\u2019re using one.\nThis brings me to a point I made on our Samsung special podcast. While that IP48 dust and waterproof rating means the foldables can let fine dirt in (anything smaller than 1mm), and their inner screen isn\u2019t as durable as a regular phone display, most normal people probably won\u2019t have any serious issues.\nI\u2019ve been to a sandy beach two times in the past year, and visited one desert, without my foldable being affected. I was careful, sure, but no more so than I am with a non-foldable.\nIf you regularly work at the beach or in, say, a dusty woodwork shop, or in a super-harsh environment, a foldable might not be ideal. But for most folks, these extreme and my year-long tests prove they\u2019re surprisingly durable if you\u2019re kind to them. If durability was the reason you\u2019ve been put off buying one, it might not be as big an issue as you imagine.\nYou might also like\nHamish is a Senior Staff Writer for TechRadar and you\u2019ll see his name appearing on articles across nearly every topic on the site from smart home deals to speaker reviews to graphics card news and everything in between.

      "text": "There\u2019s only one way folding phones can get thinner, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to ditch USB-C ports yet\nThere\u2019s power in ports\nUSB-C is about as ubiquitous as a piece of tech can get. The world\u2019s most common pill-shaped data transfer and power delivery port can be found everywhere, from the side of the MacBook Air to the interiors of cars, from power banks to the PS5.\nIt\u2019s also the port of choice for every currently-made smartphone. Android phone makers took to USB-C, with its reversible connection and impressive data transfer speeds, in the late 2010s \u2013 Apple, however, lagged behind until 2023, when incoming European Union regulations forced the world\u2019s biggest company to adopt USB-C for new iPhone models.\nWith how universal and powerful the USB-C port is, there\u2019s been little reason to suspect that it could disappear any time soon... until now.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the thinnest booklet-style folding phone on the market, at just 4.2mm when unfolded \u2013 having held one myself, I can tell you that it\u2019s a truly beautiful phone that impresses with its design and spec sheet in equal measure. As our in-depth Galaxy Z Fold 7 review finds, \u201cit\u2019s the best large-screen foldable ever made\u201d.\nHowever, that thinness doesn\u2019t leave much room for ports, and tilting the phone to look at the bottom edge reveals a USB-C port that seems barely contained by the surrounding chassis. The same is true for other thin folding phones like the Oppo Find N5 \u2013 during my testing of that phone, I was told that Oppo had modified its USB-C housing to get it to fit on the phone\u2019s 4.2mm edge.\nIf folding phones keep getting thinner, the USB-C port may become a limiting factor, and eventually a prime target for removal. If folding phones prove functional, this could be seen as an invitation for phone makers to save space and money by removing the USB-C port from slab phones, too.\nMy first exposure to the idea of a portless smartphone was through a 2020 YouTube video from MKBHD, wherein host Marques Brownlee considered that MagSafe could signal an upcoming end to ports on the iPhone lineup.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHowever, smartphone ports have thus far survived the widespread adoption of wireless charging capability, and I honestly think they\u2019ll survive the ongoing thinning of folding phones, too. It\u2019s not time to ditch USB-C ports just yet: let me explain.\nFirstly, the reason MagSafe didn\u2019t immediately kill off the charging port was because wireless charging in 2020 was nowhere near fast enough to replace wired charging. And while significant steps have been taken in this domain, there\u2019s still a huge gulf between the fastest wireless chargers and the fastest wired chargers.\nThis is most acutely felt in the Android world, where phones from brands like Oppo and Xiaomi offer support for close to 100W of power delivery when using a wired charger, but typically around 25W of power delivery when using a wireless charger. The latest-generation MagSafe chargers offer around 25W of power delivery too, and while this isn\u2019t far off the iPhone\u2019s estimated 30-35W wired charging, this says more about how low the iPhone\u2019s charging power is than how powerful MagSafe is.\nAdditionally, it\u2019s probably fair to say that wireless charging is not as efficient as wired charging. In a 2024 test by iFixit, charging the iPhone 15 Pro with iFixit\u2019s GaN 65W charger resulted in 64.1% efficiency, measuring total energy draw against battery capacity. In comparison, the MagSafe 15W charger was just 41% efficient.\nLosing the USB-C port would also be a real knock for mobile photographers and filmmakers, and anyone who works with large files on their smartphone. Though data transfer can be done wirelessly, it\u2019s not as fast as wired transfer over USB, and depends on the strength of your wireless or mobile data signal.\nFurthermore, the recent WeTransfer scandal has given many pause for thought when it comes to using free file transfer services, and cloud storage services like Google Drive and OneDrive only have a limited amount of free storage. Using a USB cable is quicker, more secure, and maybe even cheaper..\nUSB-C may be the last of its kind, but it\u2019s an expected feature on today\u2019s smartphones, and even if the everyday person doesn\u2019t use it that often, it\u2019s still a boost for those who rely on speedy charging or rapid file transfers\nWith that said, the headphone jack was a boost for music lovers or those working with audio, but still ended up disappearing from the bottom edge of the world\u2019s flagship phones after Apple axed it in 2016 \u2013 the 3.5mm port now lives in exile on specialist phones made for media professionals (we salute you, Sony Xperia 1 VI).\nThe rumored iPhone Fold is still far over the horizon, so I doubt the \u2018Apple Effect\u2019 will be a major factor for quite some time when it comes to USB-C disappearing.\nSo, there you have it: I can\u2019t see the USB-C port being erased any time soon, even if folding phones continue trending towards slimmer and slimmer designs.\nWhat do you think? Are the USB-C port\u2019s days numbered? Let us know in the comments below.\nYou might also like\n- I'm a serial iPhone buyer, but the Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone will test my loyalty to Apple\n- If the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold gets this rumored upgrade, I\u2019ll recommend it over any other folding phone\n- The RedMagic 10S Pro takes on the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro with comparable power, incredible battery life, and a much cheaper price tag\nJamie is a Mobile Computing Staff Writer for TechRadar, responsible for covering phones and tablets.

Its cover display is one of the biggest you'll find on a flip phone, and the software is packed full of powerful features, but the interface is a bit of a mess.\nPros\n- Big 4.1-inch cover screen\n- Lower price than the Razr\n- Powerful software\nCons\n- Disappointing chipset\n- Smaller battery than the Razr\n- Messy interface\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is a flip phone that almost has it all, from a powerful chipset to a 165Hz refresh rate, loads of megapixels, and a decently large battery. That said, this all comes at a cost, with it being one of the priciest foldable flip phones.\nPros\n- Extremely powerful\n- A big 4,700mAh battery\n- Big, high resolution screens\nCons\n- A high price\n- No telephoto camera\n- Limited dust resistance\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 \u2013 known as the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra in some regions \u2013 are two of the latest clamshell foldable phones, and they\u2019re both high-end handsets, with top-of-the-line chipsets and other impressive specs and features.\nGiven their similar form factors, these devices inherently have some things in common, but they also have quite a lot of differences, including their cameras, chipsets, screens, and batteries.\nSo, below, we've compared the Galaxy Z Flip 7 against the Razr Ultra 2025, drawing attention to each phone\u2019s specs and sharing our opinion on which device is best for what use case.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: specs comparison\nThe chart below lists all the key specs of both of these phones, so you can see at a glance what they offer and how they compare.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 | Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 |\n|---|---|---|\nDimensions (folded): | 75.2 / 85.5 / 13.7mm | 88.1 x 74 x 15.7mm |\nDimensions (unfolded): | 75.2 / 166.7 / 6.5mm | 171.5 x 74 x 7.2mm |\nWeight: | 188g | 199g |\nOS: | One UI 8, based on Android 16 | Android 15 |\nMain display: | 6.9-inch 120Hz 1080 x 2520 | 7.0-inch 165Hz 1224 x 2912 |\nCover display: | 4.1-inch 120Hz 948 x 1048 | 4.0-inch 165Hz 1080 x 1272 |\nChipset: | Exynos 2500 | Snapdragon 8 Elite |\nRAM: | 12GB | 16GB |\nStorage: | 256GB / 512GB | 512GB / 1TB |\nBattery capacity: | 4,300mAh | 4,700mAh |\nCharging: | 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless | 68W wired, 30W wireless, 5W reverse wireless |\nRear cameras: | 50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide | 50MP main, 50MP ultra-wide |\nFront cameras: | 10MP | 50MP |\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: price and availability\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 was launched in July 2025 and is now widely available. It starts at $1,099 / \u00a31,049 / $1,799, for which you\u2019ll get a version with 256GB of storage, and it rises to $1,219 / \u00a31,149 / AU$1,999 for 512GB.\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is slightly older, having launched back in April, and this costs $1,299 / \u00a31,099 for a model with 512GB of storage. There\u2019s also a 1TB model for $1,499, but this isn\u2019t available in the UK, and neither model is available in Australia.\nSo, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a higher starting price than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, and in the US, at least, it even costs more for a comparable amount of storage, though in the UK you\u2019ll pay less for the 512GB Razr Ultra 2025 than the 512GB Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: design\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 look quite similar, as both have a cover screen that takes up the entire half of the phone and even wraps around the cameras. Both also have a punch-hole camera on their foldable screens.\nHowever, their dimensions and weights differ, with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 coming in at 166.7 x 75.2 x 6.5mm when unfolded, 85.5 x 75.2 x 13.7mm when folded, and 188g. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is 171.5 x 74 x 7.2mm when unfolded, 88.1 x 74 x 15.7mm when folded, and 199g. So, Samsung\u2019s phone is shorter, slimmer, and lighter, but slightly wider.\nTheir colors also differ, of course, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 coming in Blue Shadow, Jet Black, Coral Red, and Mint shades, while the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is sold in Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Scarab, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret shades.\nThe Pantone Mountain Trail option uses real wood, and the Pantone Scarab shade uses Alcantara suede, so in those cases, it\u2019s more than just a choice of color, and these options give you something more unusual and striking than you\u2019ll get with the Z Flip 7.\nBoth phones, though, have an aluminum frame, and both have an IP48 rating, meaning they can be submerged up to 1.5 meters deep in water for up to 30 minutes, but only have minimal dust resistance.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: display\nAs for their screens, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a 6.9-inch 1080 x 2520 foldable AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 2,600 nits. It also has a 4.1-inch 948 x 1048 AMOLED cover screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 2,600 nits.\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, on the other hand, has a 7.0-inch 1224 x 2912 foldable AMOLED screen with a 165Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 4,500 nits, along with a 4.0-inch 1080 x 1272 AMOLED cover screen with a 165Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 3,000 nits.\nSo, the Razr Ultra 2025 has a slightly bigger, higher-resolution main display, with a higher refresh rate and peak brightness. Its cover screen also has a higher resolution, refresh rate, and peak brightness, but comes in at a marginally smaller size than the Z Flip 7\u2019s.\nWe were very impressed with the Razr\u2019s screens in our Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 review, concluding that \u201cif the Razr Ultra only had the excellent 7-inch internal screen, it would be great, but the 4-inch cover puts this phone in a class of its own. It\u2019s the only flip phone that is truly two phones in one.\u201d\nMind you, that assessment only applied at the time of the Razr's launch, when the Z Flip 7 didn't exist yet. On the display front, the Z Flip 7 is just as impressive as the Motorola, with our Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 review stating that it has \u201cexcellent displays inside and out.\u201d\nAs mentioned, the Samsung has a marginally larger cover screen than the Razr Ultra 2025, and we called it \"an astounding cover display with the thinnest bezels ever\" in our review. On paper, then, it's arguably the better of the two phones when closed, but Motorola's cover screen software is much simpler to use (more on this later).\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: cameras\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 both have a 50MP f/1.8 main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS), but that\u2019s mostly where the similarities in their camera setups end.\nThey do both also have ultra-wide cameras, but while the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a 12MP f/2.2 one with a 123-degree field of view, the Razr Ultra 2025 has a 50MP f/2.0 one with a 122-degree field of view.\nOn the foldable screen, there\u2019s a 10MP f/2.2 camera in the case of the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and a 50MP f/2.0 one with the Razr Ultra 2025.\nSo, the Razr has better camera specs on paper, with more megapixels in its ultra-wide and selfie cameras. It can also record video in up to 8K quality, while the Galaxy Z Flip 7 tops out at 4K.\nAll that said, both phones impressed us with their photography skills when we put them through their respective reviews, with the main issue being the same for both \u2013 namely the lack of a telephoto camera.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: performance and software\nBoth the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 have high-end chipsets, but while the Razr has a Snapdragon 8 Elite (also found in the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7), the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has Samsung\u2019s in-house Exynos 2500.\nThe latter doesn\u2019t quite match Snapdragon\u2019s offering, with our Z Flip 7 review finding that \u201cperformance is adequate, but not superlative.\" The Razr Ultra 2025, meanwhile, delivered \u201cexcellent\u201d performance in our testing. That\u2019s probably helped by Motorola\u2019s phone also having 16GB of RAM, compared to 12GB in the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7.\nFor software, both phones have a lot of potential, with loads of features and AI tools, but our Z Flip 7 review found that Samsung hides many of the best bits away. On the other hand, we found that the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025\u2019s AI image generator would sometimes cook up offensive stereotypes and generate copyrighted characters, so both phones could use some work on the software front.\nOverall, though, Samsung\u2019s phone has more tools, including powerful features like DeX, allowing you to use the phone like a desktop, while Motorola\u2019s is more intuitive, and closer to Google\u2019s take on Android.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: battery\nThere\u2019s a clear winner here, as while the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has an unremarkable 4,300mAh battery, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a far larger 4,700mAh one.\nThat larger battery unsurprisingly translates to longer life, with our review finding that the Ultra has \u201cexcellent all-day battery life\u201d, while the Galaxy Z Flip 7\u2019s battery life was found to be \u201cunimpressive,\u201d with it usually but not always lasting a full day.\nMotorola\u2019s phone also charges faster, with 68W wired, 30W wireless, and 5W reverse wireless charging, compared to 25W, 15W, and 4.5W for wired, wireless, and reverse wireless, respectively, when charging the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Motorola Razr Ultra 2025: verdict\nOn paper, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a lot of clear advantages over the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7. It has a more powerful chipset, more RAM, more megapixels in some of its cameras, a bigger, faster-charging battery, and brighter, higher-resolution screens.\nIt also has a more unusual and eye-catching build, though its starting price is slightly higher.\nOf course, on-paper specs don\u2019t always translate to real-world performance, but our Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 review specifically highlighted it as being a better phone than the Z Flip 7 \u2013 so for most people, the Razr is probably the better buy.\nThat said, with both phones achieving 4.5-star reviews, you'll likely find lots to love with either of them.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

  "argos_summary": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 impresses with its stylish design and enhanced cover screen, now measuring 4.1 inches and featuring a 120Hz refresh rate, making it more functional when closed. However, its performance is somewhat hindered by the Exynos 2500 chipset compared to competitors like the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, which boasts a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, superior camera specs, and a larger battery. While the Z Flip 7 is priced at $1,099, the Razr Ultra starts at $1,299, making the Flip 7 a more affordable option, but the Razr Ultra offers better overall performance and features.",
