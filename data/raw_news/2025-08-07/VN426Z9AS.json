He projects the price could rally more than 156% to reach $0.000032, potentially kicking off a larger trend reversal.\n\nWyckoff Insider noted SHIB's daily candle closed within the volume profile range, a traditionally bullish formation. He confirmed a long setup is in play, with a stop-loss placed just below the Last Point of Support (LPS) to manage risk exposure.\n\nStatistics: According to Shibburn, over 9.61 million SHIB tokens were burned in just 24 hours \u2014 pushing the burn rate up by a staggering 3,464.7%. Shibariumscan reports that daily transactions remain robust, consistently staying above 4.6 million.\n\nIntoTheBlock data shows Shiba Inu large transaction volume narrowed by 28.1% in a single day while daily active addresses inched 0.97% higher. Transactions greater than $100,000 dropped from 80 to 59.\n\nCommunity News: In a major governance shift, Shiba Inu announced elections to form its first president and DAO Council, aiming to decentralize the management of its token and governance structure.

      "text": "Mysterious personality Shytoshi Kusama announced elections to appoint a new lead visionary for the decentralized Shiba Inu SHIB/USD ecosystem\nTransfer Of Power\nKusama stated in a blog post that the elections are a \u201cvital aspect\u201d of achieving full decentralization for the blockchain project.\n\u201cNo matter what stands as the future for Shib, we are happy to move forward with the process of finding tomorrow\u2019s leaders. This will be an event like the transition of power in any state,\u201d Kusama added.\nSee Also: Shiba Inu Celebrates Its 5th Birthday With Burn Rate Spiking To 5,800%\nThe Voting Process\nThe interim president, chosen by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization vote, will oversee and facilitate the transition. Kusama said that the president should be \u201cratified\u201d within four months of Shibizenship, an equivalent of citizenship in the proposed \u201cShiba State.\u201c\nThree voting sessions will be held to find the interim President. In the first session, anyone can nominate themselves, and the top ten go to the debate round. The top three candidates will be shortlisted in the second round of voting, followed by a final vote one week after their debates. The process looked eerily similar to the presidential debates in U.S. elections.\nResponsibility Of $7 Billion SHIB Token\nThe president will be responsible for the transfer of power, well-being, future vision and execution of the Shib Paper guidelines and vision.\n\u201cMost importantly, they are responsible for the community of millions and the financial responsibility of a $7 billion dollar token,\u201d Kusama said. Upon the release of this document, the role of completing Ryoshi's vision will shift from the current leadership to the community.\nKusama To Fade Away?\nKusama has steered the Shiba Inu ecosystem since the abrupt exit of Ryoshi in 2022.\nIn July of last year, he stated that the project was nearing completion of founder Ryoshi\u2019s vision of a completely decentralized system and that they, too, would \u201cstep away from the limelight\u201d at some point.\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00001211, down 1.43% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next:\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto Courtesy: Dennis Diatel on Shutterstock.com\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
