      "feedback": "Strengths: solid first-principles, regime-based framing and credible numeric anchors; strong use of source IDs for key facts; clear attempt at 0–3 week and 1–3 month horizons. Primary issues to fix for world-class quality: (1) enforce the exact Movers format (4 lines total, 2 Up and 2 Down) with the required fields and a separate Swing Trade/Outlook plan, and remove any extra narrative lines (the current draft includes an extra Outlook block and extended prose that violate the constraint); (2) tighten each Up/Down line to a single driver, a crisp watch signal, and a probabilistic weight tied to explicit evidence (e.g., 60% (48JXC9VDP) for the MSFT/Shopify Up line, 25% (W2622L6WW)(65UUBU0OR) for Ford Down, 55% (STBVARD8F)(48JXC9VDP) for the AI leadership Up, 25% (STBVARD8F)(U3ZK13ZQI)(WTNT85IPR) for the Costa/Disney Down); avoid stray or non-existent IDs (e.g., bare 11/12) and ensure all numbers are sourced to IDs present in SOURCE MATERIAL. (3) align the four lines to two tech/cloud/AI Up signals and two cyclical/defensive Down signals, with a direct, minimal causal chain from driver to watchlist; summarize causal links succinctly rather than duplicating regime narratives across lines; (4) move all invalidation/trigger logic into the Swing Trade plan (or a single Outlook line if non-tradable) and keep the Movers lines strictly about drivers and observation points; (5) deliver a one-line, tradable-Swing-Trade plan (if MSFT/Shopify or another liquid asset is chosen) or a concise one-line Outlook (if non-tradable), with horizon, entry/stop/target, R/R, invalidation, trigger, probability, and confidence, and ensure it remains within 1 line (or up to 2 if needed); (6) prune the long-form Base/Alt-path narrative and any ostensibly conflicting regime overlays so the core four lines map cleanly to observable assets and triggers; (7) ensure consistency of horizons and units (months vs weeks) across lines and that every numerical claim has a matching in-text citation; (8) provide a succinct, asset-focused watchlist per line (1–2 bullets) rather than multi-clause prose; (9) after the 4 lines, present a single Swing Trade or Outlook line in the required format if applicable, not a composite narrative; (10) confirm that the output adheres strictly to the 4-line movers block and the 1–2-line plan constraint, with no trailing citation lists.",
