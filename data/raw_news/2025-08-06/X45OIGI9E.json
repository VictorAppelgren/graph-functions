  "title": "'Fabric of Cumbernauld has fallen apart after church fire'",
  "description": "A blaze on Saturday night wiped out the 1960s St Mungo's Church building in the new town.",
  "content": "The destruction of a Cumbernauld church in a devastating fire will have lasting repercussions for the area, locals fear. The blaze that wiped out the St Mungo's Church building on Saturday came just over a week after another fire wrecked the nearby Cumbernauld Cottage Theatre. Community groups that used the church for events have been left scrambling to find replacement space. There were no injuries in the blaze, which took until Sunday to put out.\n\nCaroline Noble, a volunteer with Cumbernauld and Carbrain Community Hub, told BBC Scotland News she feels like the original landmarks and heritage of the North Lanarkshire new town are disappearing. She said: \"The full fabric of Cumbernauld has just fallen apart, really. It kind of feels like there is going to be nothing left, which is sad.\" The 1960s church, designed by Scottish architect Alan Reiach, is a B-listed building - meaning it is classed as being of regional or local importance.\n\nThe community hub, based minutes away from the church, would use the building for some bigger events or activities, including a weekly caf\u00e9 offering free breakfasts. Organisers have since found an alternative site for the caf\u00e9, but Ms Noble believes the loss of the church - and in particular the distinctive triangular roof visible across the area's skyline - will take time to get used to. She added: \"It's such an iconic building in Cumbernauld. Everyone was talking about it because it's just such a shock.\" Rhona McMillan, a member of the Cumbernauld Gaelic Choir that used the church as a rehearsal space, said the news was terrible. She told BBC Scotland News: \" It is a huge loss to the community and our thoughts are with the congregation and ministry team. \"The choir have been rehearsing there for three years every Monday night, and it was an ideal space for singing and learning Gaelic.\"\n\nThe St Mungo's Church building was part of Trinity Parish Church, a union formed from Cumbernauld Old Church and Kildrum and St Mungo's churches in August 2024. Any decision on what happens next with the building will partly lie with the Church of Scotland, whose moderator the Rt Rev Rosie Frew said she was shocked by the fire. She said: \"As well as being the focus of much of the life, work and worship of the congregation, St Mungo's has been both an iconic landmark and a place of special memories for the people of Cumbernauld. \"My thoughts and prayers, and those of members of the Church of Scotland, are with the congregation and community at this difficult time.\" She is scheduled to visit the site later. Rev Alastair Duncan, the interim moderator of Cumbernauld Trinity Church, said the congregation had been left devastated and that the building was \"cherished by many\". He added: \"Aside from its distinctive architecture, the B-listed building is held in great affection by the people of Cumbernauld, and its location remains a significant presence for the Church of Scotland.\"\n\nOnline speculation has already intensified for what will happen next to the site, including calls for it to be rebuilt. Ms Noble, who studied the area's heritage for her masters degree, believes the building's importance to the overall community should not be underplayed. She said: \"I truly believe that heritage spaces are more than buildings, they are places where people's stories and memories are all held. \"When the building isn't there, those stories still exist, so it has been more than just a building - not just for the church but for the whole community. \"It's going to be odd not having it there.\"",

      "text": "Call for rethink after theatre has funding cut\n- Published\nA Scottish government minister is calling on Creative Scotland to rethink its \"disappointing\" decision not to grant funding to Cumbernauld Theatre.\nThe theatre has been running for more than 60 years and moved into a new purpose-built arts venue less than four years ago.\nLast week, it released a statement saying it was \"heartbroken\" after it was the only regularly-funded organisation which had its application for multi-year funding turned down, putting 44 jobs at risk.\nJamie Hepburn, the SNP MSP for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, described the theatre as the \"jewel in the crown\" of the local community and said he would do \"everything he can\" to secure its future.\nCreative Scotland is an arms-length body responsible for distributing arts and creative industry funding provided by the Scottish government.\nLast week, it revealed the 251 organisations which will share more than \u00a3200m in funding over the next three years.\nCumbernauld Theatre currently receives \u00a3266,000 per year from Creative Scotland, which will be discontinued from the beginning of April.\nSarah Price, the chief executive of the theatre, said: \"Cumbernauld Theatre is a vital part of Scotland's cultural landscape\n\"While this decision is devastating, we remain committed to exploring every possible avenue to secure the future of our theatre.\"\nThe theatre has said it will apply for the Transition Fund offered by Creative Scotland.\nThis fund is designed to provide short-term funding for organisations that were previously funded on an ongoing basis but were unsuccessful in their multi-year funding application - like Cumbernauld Theatre.\nCreative Scotland have seen a substantial uplift in its budget from the Scottish government.\nIt says this has allowed it to fund the largest portfolio of cultural organisations ever to be supported on a multi-year basis in Scotland - with 141 organisations receiving multi-year funding for the first time.\nAlongside the 251 organisations which will receive grants, 14 other organisations will be supported by a development fund.\nFifteen organisations, including Cumbernauld Theatre, had their application turned down.\nA Creative Scotland spokesperson told the BBC that they are meeting with the theatre's leadership to discuss why their application was rejected and their options for future support.\nThey said: \"Until those discussions have happened, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published30 January"
