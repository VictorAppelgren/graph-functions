  "content": "Claude is getting a better, if selective, memory. Rather than acting as perfect catalog of everything you've talked about or shared, Anthropic says the AI chatbot now has the ability to reference past chats when asked, so you don't have to re-explain yourself.\n\nThe feature seems like it could help you pick up a work project after time away, or query Claude for the details of a past research session that you don't quite remember. The key point is that Claude has to be prompted: It doesn't call on past chats unless you specifically ask it to. Anthropic also says that Claude's ability to reference chats is specific to the workspace and project you're working in.\n\nAnthropic's implementation is much more limited in scope compared to how ChatGPT's memory feature works. OpenAI updated ChatGPT in April to save all conversations you have with it, and rely on those records to personalize answers to any new question or prompt you send. The basic idea is that every conversation could improve the chatbot's responses. Google lets Gemini similarly recall past conversations and has also tested using Google Search history to further personalize AI responses.\n\nIn contrast to both, Claude is really only performing a search of past conversations when asked, not referencing a profile of past chats. It's more privacy-minded by default and you can disable Claude's ability to do it at all via a settings toggle.\n\nIf you're subscribed to the Max, Team or Enterprise plans, Claude's new ability should be rolling out now, according to Anthropic. The company says the feature will expand to other plans soon.",

      "text": "Gemini Advanced can now recall your past conversations to inform its responses\nThe feature is rolling out first in English before becoming available in other languages.\nGoogle is making Gemini just a bit better. Starting today, the company's chatbot will recall past conversations in an effort to provide more useful responses. \"That means no more starting over from scratch or having to search for a previous conversation thread,\" Google explains. \"Plus, you can build on top of previous conversations or projects you\u2019ve already started.\"\nGoogle notes Gemini \"may\" indicate if it referenced a past conversation to formulate a response. If the idea of a chatbot recalling information about you makes you feel uncomfortable, Google says users can \"easily review, delete or decide how long\" Gemini retains their chat history. Additionally, it's possible to disable this feature altogether from the My Activity panel.\nGemini is not the first chatbot to include a memory feature. ChatGPT will \"remember\" things about you in certain contexts. For example, I recently asked OpenAI's chatbot a question about Jeff Buckley's vocal range, to which it later asked me if I was a fan of his music. When I said yes, a notification appeared stating \"memory updated.\"\nMore broadly, building chatbots with long, reliable memories is part of the \"agentic\" AI future many companies, including Google and OpenAI, are building towards. At I/O 2024, for instance, Google debuted Project Astra, which featured a built-in memory, though it was limited to a relatively short window of time and could \"mis-remember\" things.\nGemini's new memory feature has begun rolling out in English to Gemini Advanced subscribers. It will become available in more languages over the coming weeks."

      "text": "Gemini gets personal, with tailored help from your Google apps\nWith Gemini, we\u2019re creating a personal AI assistant \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t just answer general questions, but understands you. Today, we\u2019re taking another step toward this goal with the launch of Gemini with personalization, a new experimental capability.\nPowered by our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model, personalization allows Gemini to connect with your Google apps and services, starting with Search, to provide responses that are uniquely insightful and directly address your needs. With your permission, Gemini can now tailor its responses based on your past searches, saving you time and delivering more precise answers. In the coming months, Gemini will expand its ability to understand you by connecting with other Google apps and services, including Photos and YouTube. This will enable Gemini to provide more personalized insights, drawing from a broader understanding of your activities and preferences to deliver responses that truly resonate with you.\nHere\u2019s how it works: In Gemini Apps, you can select \u201cPersonalization (experimental)\u201d from the model drop-down menu 1 to connect to your Search history. Then, when you enter a prompt, Gemini will analyze it and determine if your Search history can enhance the response. You're in control of your info and can easily disconnect Gemini from your Search history.\nWe\u2019ll only use your Search history when our advanced reasoning models determine that it\u2019s actually helpful. Early testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations. We\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\nWant to give it a try? Here are a few examples of prompts you can ask Gemini with personalization enabled:\n- Where should I go on vacation this summer?\n- I want to start a YouTube channel but need content ideas.\n- What would you suggest I learn as a new hobby / job?\nGemini with personalization is launching as an experimental feature 2 , available to Gemini and Gemini Advanced subscribers on the web today, and gradually rolling out on mobile. It's available in over 45 languages and in the majority of countries around the world 3 .\nPrivacy and data controls built in\nWith this update, you're firmly in control of your information. We've implemented robust privacy safeguards:\n- Clear notice: Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to your Search history or any other apps. This ensures you have full awareness and control over whether your data is used.\n- Transparency of data sources: Our advanced thinking model provides a full outline of how Gemini personalizes responses, and can show you which data sources \u2014 your saved info, past chats or Search history \u2014 were used. When you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history.\n- Data and control: With this experimental feature, Gemini will only access your Search history when you've selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you have Web & App Activity on. You can also view and manage your Search history.\nMore ways to personalize Gemini\nYou can already share your interests, preferences and important details with Gemini \u2014 like dietary restrictions or partners\u2019 names \u2014 to allow for more natural conversations and relevant responses. Additionally, Advanced subscribers can ask Gemini to refer to their past chats to deliver more helpful responses to your current questions. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll roll out this ability to all Gemini users in over 45 languages, further enhancing the tailored experience 4 .\nThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance.

      "text": "ChatGPT can now remember all your past conversations\nThe chatbot's \"memory\" gets even better.\nThe next time you conclude a conversation with ChatGPT, it will save what you said to memory, even if you don't ask it explicitly to do so. \"We have greatly improved memory in chatgpt \u2014 it can now reference all your past conversations!\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on Thursday in an X post spotted by The Verge. \"This is a surprisingly great feature imo, and it points at something we are excited about: ai systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized.\"\nOpenAI has been working on improving ChatGPT's memory since 2023 when the company began testing custom instructions, a feature that allows users to set preferences that ChatGPT will consider in future conversations. For example, you can tell the chat bot you have a family of four, and it will remember that detail when you ask for it dinner recipes. At the start of last year, OpenAI began allowing users to tell ChatGPT to remember specific details from chats. With this latest update, ChatGPT will remember both you tell it to and insights it gleans from your conversations.\n\"The more you use ChatGPT, the more useful it becomes. New conversations build upon what it already knows about you to make smoother, more tailored interactions over time,\" OpenAI says of the feature. The company is currently rolling out the update to users of its $200 per month Pro plan and $20 per month Plus tier. Team, Enterprise and Edu users can expect to gain access \"in a few weeks.\" OpenAI did not say when it would roll out the update to free users.\nIf you don't want ChatGPT to save your conversations with it, you can disable the feature through the settings menu. \"If you\u2019ve already opted out of memory, ChatGPT won\u2019t reference past conversations by default,\" says OpenAI. You can also use the Temporary Chat feature on a case by case basis for conversations you don't want ChatGPT to save to memory."
