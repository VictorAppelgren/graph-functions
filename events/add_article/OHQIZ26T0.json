      "summary": "Gemini Space Station, Inc., a global crypto platform founded by the Winklevoss twins, has filed a Form S-1 with the SEC to pursue an initial public offering of its Class A common stock, which will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker \"GEMI.\" The offering details, including share count and price range, remain undetermined and are subject to market conditions, with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Cantor among the lead bookrunners. A preliminary prospectus will be available through the bookrunners once the registration becomes effective, and the company emphasizes that the filing does not constitute an offer to sell securities until the registration is effective.",
