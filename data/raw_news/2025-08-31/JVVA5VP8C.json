  "content": "The White House is pushing to rebrand the Pentagon, confirming Saturday plans to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, The Wall Street Journal first reported.\n\nThe Department of War was established by Congress in August 1789 to oversee the operation and maintenance of the military branches. After a brief name change to the National Military Establishment following World War II, it was changed to the Department of Defense.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told Fox News the change comes amid a restoration of U.S. military values.\n\n\"As President [Donald] Trump said, our military should be focused on offense \u2014 not just defense \u2014 which is why he has prioritized warfighters at the Pentagon instead of DEI and woke ideology,\" Kelly wrote in a statement. \"Stay tuned!\"\n\nThe announcement comes days after Trump said the name change would happen \"over the next week or so.\"\n\n\"You know we call it the Department of Defense, but between us, I think we're going to change the name,\" the president said at the White House earlier in the week. \"You want to know the truth, I think we're going to have some information on that, maybe soon.\"\n\nSEN ROGER WICKER: THE PENTAGON NEEDS MAJOR REFORM. NOW IS OUR CHANCE\n\nTrump noted the historical importance of the department's name during both world wars.\n\n\"We won World War I [and] World War II. It was called the Department of War. To me, that's really what it is,\" he said. \"I'm talking to the people. Everybody likes that. We had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War. Then we changed it to Department of Defense.\"\n\nCongress creates federal executive departments by law, so an amendment would be required to change the name legally.\n\n\"I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that. But, if we need that, I'm sure Congress will go along,\" Trump said. \"\u2026 Defense is too defensive. And we want to be defensive, but we want to be offensive too, if we have to be. So it just sounded to me like a better name.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe president can recommend legislation to make the change official, or rebrand it informally without approval.",

      "text": "Last year, I released two plans for reforming the military. The first, 21st Century Peace through Strength, focused on the need for additional defense funding to produce what the U.S. military needs to keep the peace.\nThe second, Restoring Freedom\u2019s Forge, outlined a plan to change fundamentally the Pentagon\u2019s business processes away from a Soviet-style bureaucratic mess to a modern process that rewards commercial innovation and fosters competition.\nFortunately, President Donald Trump campaigned on both these issues. He promised a defense spending boost, and we are well on our way after the $150 billion military infusion included in the reconciliation bill. And the president promised to pursue wholesale Pentagon reform, getting rid of red tape and instead freeing our innovators to build weapons better, faster and at lower cost.\nIn Congress, we recognize that we have no time to waste. The Senate Armed Services Committee recently voted overwhelmingly (26-1) to advance Congress\u2019 annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This bill contains the most significant reforms to the Pentagon\u2019s weapons-buying process in generations.\nARMY UNVEILS MODERNIZATION PLAN BECAUSE, \u2018NO LOBBYIST EVER WON A WAR'\nFor decades, we have paid defense companies to develop weapons primarily with taxpayer money. While this process will still be necessary for some systems, there are thousands of innovative companies who are developing weapons using private capital. This bill is written to encourage acquisition by those companies, who are often outpacing the Pentagon\u2019s processes by years.\nWe have also spent many years under a broken weapons buying process. At dozens of stages, officials can say \"No\" and slow programs down. As it stands, program managers decide what to buy but shortly thereafter lose authority over the process. From there, contracting officers under a separate reporting structure can take 18 months to run a compliance-based process. This NDAA would create portfolio acquisition executives who are empowered to make decisions, take risk and then be held accountable for decisions.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nFor decades, we have levied a crazy, years-long bureaucratic process to qualify new parts and types of weapons for military use. That process rewards the status quo and severely discourages competition. This bill will create a new streamlined process for qualification, pairing it with a new $1 billion fund from the reconciliation bill. Taken together, we will dramatically improve competition at the Pentagon and protect against price-gouging.\nThe United States has a legacy of building some of the most advanced munitions in the world. The track records of our GMLRS surface-to-surface missiles and Patriot air defense interceptors are undeniable. But not every one of our weapons needs to be \"exquisite,\" a term of art for systems that are sophisticated, intricate and difficult to build. Instead, we are providing nearly $5 billion in defense reconciliation for new lower-cost munitions, many of which will be produced through advanced manufacturing.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe are living in the most dangerous moment since World War II. To enable an American-led 21st century, we need a military and a defense industrial base capable of maintaining the peace. The defense reconciliation bill made a big bet on American innovation, and the Senate\u2019s 2026 NDAA introduces fundamental Pentagon reforms. With both, we can achieve a generational rebuilding of the U.S. military."

So it just sounded to me like a better name.\"\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES HE IS 'RESTORING' THE NAMES OF SEVERAL BASES CHANGED UNDER BIDEN\nThe Department of Defense says on its website that the Department of War was established by Congress in August 1789 \"at the cabinet level to oversee the operation and maintenance of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps.\"\nFollowing the conclusion of World War II, in July 1947, President Harry Truman signed the National Security Act which, the site says, merged \"the Navy and War Departments and the newly independent Air Force into a single organization called the National Military Establishment led by a civilian secretary of defense who also oversees the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\"\nTwo years later in August 1949, the National Security Act was amended, renaming the National Military Establishment as the Department of Defense.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The change rescinded the cabinet-level statuses of Army, Navy and Air Force secretaries and made them all subordinate to the secretary of defense, whose authority and responsibilities increased,\" the Department of Defense website says."

      "text": "The Senate is seeking to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s policy toward Ukraine, which has oscillated between support and sudden withdrawal, leaving allies and officials guessing.\nAfter President Donald Trump recently agreed to resume sending weapons to Ukraine, the Senate\u2019s annual defense policy bill would curb the kind of executive branch adventurism that has sparked bipartisan concern, particularly regarding Pentagon decisions.\nThe National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), unveiled Friday after bipartisan negotiations by the Senate Armed Services Committee, includes specific guardrails on U.S. military cooperation. One provision stipulates that the secretary of defense cannot unilaterally cease military intelligence sharing and targeting cooperation with Ukraine.\nThis move follows a March episode in which the Trump administration abruptly paused both intelligence support and weapons shipments to Ukraine while the president pursued backchannel diplomacy with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Though the freeze was later lifted, the incident alarmed lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\nThe NDAA also \"reaffirms that it is the policy of the United States to assist Ukraine in maintaining a credible defense\" and boosts the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to $500 million.\nThe bill bars Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from reducing U.S. force posture in Europe or relinquishing the U.S. role as NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander without an impact analysis and certification to Congress that such changes align with U.S. interests.\nThe new provisions arrive amid a notable shift in Trump\u2019s rhetoric, which has turned more supportive of Ukraine and more critical of Putin.\nEarlier this month, the Pentagon once again paused delivery of previously pledged defensive aid to Kyiv, citing an internal assessment of U.S. stockpiles. Reports indicate that this pause may have been initiated without informing the White House.\n\"This decision was made to put America\u2019s interests first,\" said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly, referring to a Department of Defense review. Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell echoed that framing, calling it a \"capability review\" and adding, \"We can\u2019t give weapons to everybody in the world.\"\nShortly afterward, Trump contradicted the pause by suggesting the U.S. would send Patriot missile interceptors and additional defensive aid to Ukraine. The Pentagon subsequently announced it would resume the shipments.\n\"We\u2019re going to send some more weapons. We have to \u2014 they have to be able to defend themselves,\" Trump said Monday evening.\nDespite speaking with both Russian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin last week, Trump described his discussion with the Russian president as fruitless.\n\"We get a lot of bulls--- thrown at us by Putin,\" Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting. \"He\u2019s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\"\nPressed on who had authorized the pause in military aid, Trump appeared unsure.\n\"I don\u2019t know, why don\u2019t you tell me?\" he said Wednesday. According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump told Zelenskyy he was not responsible for the decision.\nUS WILL 'HAVE TO' SEND WEAPONS TO UKRAINE, TRUMP SAYS DAYS AFTER PENTAGON PAUSE\nOn Thursday, when a reporter asked whether he\u2019d figured out who ordered the halt, Trump replied, \"Well, I haven\u2019t thought about it. ... I have, no I have not gone into it.\"\nAsked what it says that such a major decision could be made without his knowledge, he insisted, \"I would know if a decision was made. I will know. I\u2019ll be the first to know. In fact, most likely I\u2019d give the order \u2014 but I haven\u2019t done that yet.\"\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio downplayed the significance of the pause, describing it as a \"limited review\" of specific munitions types, a common step after sustained operations in the Middle East and Europe.\n\"It was logical,\" Rubio said, \"especially after an extended engagement in defense of Israel and our own bases.\"\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce also sought to reassure allies, saying, \"The president has been obviously very passionate and determined regarding the ability of Ukraine to defend itself.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe administration\u2019s current tone marks a stark shift from earlier this year, when tensions between Trump and Zelenskyy reached a boiling point during a contentious February Oval Office meeting.\n\"You have to be thankful. You don\u2019t have the cards,\" Trump reportedly told Zelenskyy, after calling him a \"dictator\" earlier that month."

Trump and the administration emphasize restoring historical naming and streamlining Pentagon bureaucracy, citing a new NDAA with acquisition reforms. The move is tied to a broader agenda of boosting defense spending and reducing bureaucratic red tape, with a potential legislative change expected within weeks.
