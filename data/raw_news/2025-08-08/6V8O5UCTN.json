  "description": "In the wake of a devastating loss, the Willgoose family is on a mission to transform UK schools into safe havens, free from the shadow of knife violence.",
  "content": "Tragic Harvey Willgoose's heartbroken family are demanding that knife arches are installed in all UK schools to prevent another child losing their life. Caroline Willgoose and her husband Mark have become prominent campaigners against knife violence since Harvey was stabbed to death at All Saints Catholic High School, in Sheffield, in February, having previously been oblivious to the dangers lurking in British classrooms. But they say the devastating tragedy that has struck their family must not be allowed to happen to another child inside school grounds. Harvey's murderer was found guilty today. Mrs Willgoose said: \u201cIt's all brand new to us. It always happens to someone else. You think of it being like gang culture, and Harvey was nothing to do with anything like that. \"He just loved football, he loved life, he loved socializing. But I now know it's a massive problem.\"\n\nMrs Willgoose said she and her family are now devoting themselves to their campaign for knife arches in school. She added: \u201cOur lives are ruined because I know that I'm never, ever going to be happy again. \"His sister, his brother, we're never going to be happy again. And, that's a fact.\" The family began speaking out against knife violence soon after Harvey died in February and met with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in March discuss their concerns. They have an online petition which currently has 52,000 signatories.\n\nMrs Willgoose said: \u201cThis can't happen again. We know after all this that there are knives in schools. \u201cHarvey knew that, the children knew that, and they\u2019re frightened. The one place that children should be safe is in school. \u201cOnce we get knife arches in, then we'll go into schools and educate children about the devastation of knives.",

      "text": "Schoolboy, 15, fatally stabbed after online argument escalates into violence\nTeen victim told his father he didn't want to go to school \"where people had knives\" days before he was stabbed to death by a 13cm hunting blade.\nA 15-year-old schoolboy told his dad he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to school where people had knives\u201d days before he was fatally stabbed in the heart following a social media spat with a fellow pupil, a jury heard. Harvey Willgoose collapsed and died after a simmering Snapchat argument erupted in violence during a lunch break at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield.\nA pupil, also 15, who admits stabbing Harvey but denies murder subsequently told the headteacher: \u201cI\u2019m not right in the head\u201d after he had smuggled the deadly weapon into class. Sheffield Crown Court was shown \u201cshocking\u201d footage of the stabbing incident on February 3, which left Harvey dead and his classmates fleeing \u201cin fear and panic\u201d. The boy, who cannot be named, admits killing Harvey with the 13cm blade, but claims it was manslaughter not murder.\nDon't miss: 15-year-old schoolboy fatally stabbed in heart during lunch break\nDon't miss: Taylor Swift's Era's Tour boosts UK economy with \u00a310bn from 23 million music ...\nDays before his death Harvey skipped class following a knife incident at the school involving other pupils, text messaging his dad to tell him: \u201cAm not going in that school while people have knives\u201d.\nIt is alleged the previous incident led to Harvey and the defendant falling out in a Snapchat group, with each siding with one of the boys involved in the initial dispute, who had been suspended.\nOpening the case Richard Thyne KC, prosecuting, told how after being disarmed the killer told All Saints\u2019 head Sean Pender: \u201cI\u2019m not right in the head. My mum doesn\u2019t look after me right. I\u2019ve stabbed him.\u201d\nThe prosecutor said the boy confirmed to Mr Pender he was referring to Harvey, and that he had stabbed him once or twice.\nMr Thyne said: \u201cWhilst waiting for the emergency services to arrive, (the defendant) also told Mr Pender that he was carrying the knife for protection.\u201d\nThe prosecutor revealed the altercation happened in a school courtyard just as the lunch break was starting.\nHe played the chilling CCTV footage to the jurors, telling them: \u201cIt is shocking, but it is necessary to play it.\u201d\nDon't miss: Call centre con artists scammed vulnerable pensioner, 84, for \u00a325,000 of savings\nDon't miss: Busker Jason Allen quits performing in major UK city after being slapped by g...\nMr Thyne said the prosecution case is that the CCTV shows Harvey appearing to put his left hand on the defendant\u2019s right arm before the defendant \u201ctakes a knife out of his left pocket, passes it across into his right hand, and then stabs twice at Harvey\u2019s torso\u201d.\nHe said the defendant then advances towards Harvey, who backs away across the courtyard, before the boy \u201creturns towards where the incident began, gesturing towards Harvey with his knife, and appearing to shout at Harvey\u201d.\nThe video shows Harvey running towards the defendant, who then advances for a second time, \u201cbouncing on his toes, still brandishing the knife\u201d, the prosecutor said, adding that then \u201cHarvey backs away\u201d.\nMr Thyne said \u201cother pupils fled in fear and panic\u201d as the defendant went into the dining hall still gripping the knife.\nStaff members Carolyn Siddall and Rachel Hobkirk approached the boy as he \u201cwas dancing around on his toes and waving the knife around, although by this stage he seemed to be saying \u2018I\u2019m not going to hurt anyone'\u201d, the prosecutor said.\nHe added: \u201cThey told him to put the knife down but he did not do so.\u201d\nHe told the jury assistant head Morgan Davis arrived and \u201cfound the defendant still waving the knife around\u201d.\nAs Mr Davis told him to hand over the knife, the defendant was saying to him: \u201cYou know I can\u2019t control it,\u201d which Mr Thyne said the teacher took to be a reference to his anger issues, given previous incidents of violent behaviour at school.\nThe prosecutor said: \u201cMr Davis held his hand out and took the knife from (the defendant).\n\u201cAt the same time the headteacher, Mr Pender, placed his arm around (the defendant)\u2019s shoulder and took him along the corridor to his office.\u201d\nMr Thyne earlier told the jury how Harvey was stabbed in the heart with a hunting knife which had a 13cm, serrated-edged blade.\nHe said the defendant \u201cadmits that he stabbed Harvey causing his death\u201d and \u201calso admits that the stabbing was not carried out in lawful self-defence.\u201d\nThe teen sat in the glass-fronted dock, wearing a white shirt with no tie, as Mr Thyne outlined the case against him, flanked by a number of adults, including an intermediary.\nThe trial continues.\nComments Unavailable\nSorry, we are unable to accept comments about this article at the moment.
