  "title": "Who is Dr. Joseph Ladapo? Florida's surgeon general ending state vaccine requirements",
  "description": "Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Jospeh Lapado are calling for an end to mandatory immunizations and vaccines, even in schools.",
  "content": "\u2022 Florida officials announced plans to end all state vaccine requirements, including those for school attendance.\n\u2022 The move has been strongly opposed by major medical groups, who warn of increased risks for preventable diseases.\n\u2022 Florida has recently seen a drop in vaccination rates and a rise in diseases like whooping cough and measles.\n\nFlorida is poised to become the first state to drop all vaccine requirements, including immunizations for schools.\n\nAt a Sept. 3 press conference in Valrico in Hillsborough County, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, Florida's surgeon general, and Gov. Ron DeSantis said that all vaccine mandates in the state would end.\n\n\u201cEvery last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,\u201d Ladapo said. \u201cWho am I to tell you what your child should put in their body? I don\u2019t have that right. Your body is a gift from God.\u201d\n\nLadapo, the state's top public health official, said that he would repeal about a half-dozen vaccine requirements controlled by the Florida Department of Health and DeSantis and that the Florida Legislature would work to repeal other vaccinations required under state law such as polio, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, tetanus and other communicable diseases.\n\nA 2024 study showed that infant mortality rates have plummeted over the last 50 years and access to vaccines brought those rates 40% lower than they would have been otherwise.\n\nLeaders of the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other health professionals were quick to speak out against the move by Florida leaders.\n\nSandra Adamson Fryhofer, a member of the AMA Board of Trustees, said the group \u201cstrongly opposes Florida\u2019s plan to end all vaccine mandates, including those required for school attendance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis unprecedented rollback would undermine decades of public health progress and place children and communities at increased risk for diseases such as measles, mumps, polio, and chickenpox resulting in serious illness, disability, and even death,\u201d said Fryhofer, a board-certified physician of internal medicine.\n\n\u201cWhile there is still time, we urge Florida to reconsider this change to help prevent a rise of infectious disease outbreaks that put health and lives at risk.\u201d\n\nFlorida seeing drop in vaccinations, rise in preventable diseases\n\nVaccination rates have dropped in Florida as the anti-vaccine movement has picked up steam. Last year, the number of whooping cough cases in Florida soared eight time the cases compared to the year before as the vaccination rate dropped below herd immunity levels.\n\nA measles outbreak in Miami-Dade resulted in nine infections in 2024. with four cases of the highly infectious and potentially fatal airborne disease in the state reported so far this year. Federal and medical professional guidelines recommend that unvaccinated children in schools where cases are reported stay home for three weeks.\n\nLadapo refused to mandate that move and said that the Florida Department of Health was \"deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance.\"\n\nWhen will Florida end its vaccination requirements?\n\nNo timeline was announced at the press conference, but Ladapo said some unspecified vaccine requirements could end soon.\n\n\"We actually have the ability to start that process with what government folks call 'rules,'\" he said. \"So the Florida Department of Health, we have some, some rules that we promulgated, not me, predecessors, that include, you know, a handful, maybe a half a dozen, vaccines that that are mandated in Florida. So those are going to be gone, for sure.\"\n\nLadapo said the FDOH would work with DeSantis and lawmakers to \"get rid of the rest of it.\"\n\n\"We need to end it. It's the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nJoseph Abiodun Ladapo, 46, is a native of Nigeria and the son of a microbiologist who immigrated to the U.S. with his family in the 1980s.\n\nLadapo earned a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from Wake Forest University and an M.D. and a Ph.D in Health Policy from Harvard University. He worked at different hospitals in New York City and served as a professor at the NYU School of Medicine and a staff fellow with the Food and Drug Administration before becoming a researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Ladapo is married, with three young sons.\n\nLadapo's primary research interests, according to his previous online \"about\" page with UCLA Health, included assessing the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic technologies and reducing the population burden of cardiovascular disease.\n\nDespite his lack of specialization in infectious disease, he also became prominent in the movement against the mainstream medical community's positions on treatments, vaccines and masking. Ladapo wrote editorials for the Wall Street Journal, USA TODAY and the New York Daily News on the topic, saying masks have \u201clittle or no effect on respiratory virus transmission,\u201d despite studies to the contrary, and recommending treatments such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which have since been proven ineffective.\n\nLadapo has been associated with extremist groups such as America's Frontline Doctors and Tea Party Patriots Action and was a signatory of the Great Barrington Declaration, which criticized most pandemic mitigation measures and instead recommended allowing people to be infected to create a natural, or \"herd,\" immunity, an idea supported by President Donald Trump in his first term but considered dangerous by researchers and the larger medical community.\n\nSupporters have said he is an intelligent and credentialed scientist and fully qualified. Some of Ladapo's previous colleagues at UCLA have expressed surprise and shock at his views after the pandemic began.\n\nWhen did Joseph Ladapo become Florida's Surgeon General?\n\nIn 2020, then-Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees said in public that to fight the growing dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic Florida might need to practice social distancing well into the next year.\n\nThis conflicted with DeSantis' growing message of opening up Florida and getting children back into schools, which turned into claims of governmental oppression and speeches in favor of personal freedom. The state's surgeon general was kept out of public sight for months, during a global pandemic, before Rivkes finally retired in 2021. DeSantis replaced him with Ladapo, who had just been hired by the University of Florida College of Medicine, two events that DeSantis said at the time were coincidental.\n\nThat employment was later discovered to have been fast-tracked with the help of a DeSantis donor, resulting in the governor-appointed Florida Board of Medicine's approval in only two days rather than the usual 2-6 months. Ladapo was reportedly pushed through the UF hiring process. He also received a 52% raise over Rivkees, making him one of the top 10 highest-paid Florida government employees.\n\nLadapo was quick to support DeSantis' views and provided his own on social media, at public events and on multiple far-right anti-vaccine podcasts, claiming there was a concerted effort to hide stories of people with adverse reactions to vaccines, accusing the government in general and the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, in particular of defrauding the American people, and urging Floridians to follow their intuition over medical professionals.\n\n\u201cJust check in with your gut. Who do you think you can trust, and go with those individuals,\u201d Ladapo told First Class Fatherhood podcast host Alec Lace.\n\nSeptember 2021: Within a day of being hired, Ladapo signed new rules allowing parents to decide if children exposed to people who tested positive for COVID had to quarantine or if they could go to school, eliminating the previous requirement for exposed students to quarantine off campus for at least four days. \"Fear is done,\" he said during a press conference.\n\nOctober 2021: Ladapo refused to wear a mask at a meeting with Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky even after she told him she had a serious medical condition (later confirmed as breast cancer) and was at a higher risk for serious complications from COVID. After she asked him to leave and word got out, a firestorm erupted with Democrats and members of the medical community castigating him for endangering her life. Ladapo issued a statement nearly a week later saying he was saddened by her diagnosis but didn't think he could communicate effectively with a mask on.\n\nLadapo appeared at DeSantis' side in public appearances, promoting monoclonal antibody treatment, supporting the governor's views on blocking vaccine and mask mandates and accusing the public health community of fearmongering. Critics accused him of spreading misinformation that led to people being hesitant or afraid of vaccines.\n\nDecember 2021: The Florida Department of Health rejected a complaint about Ladapo that said he violated state medical laws by publicly casting doubts about COVID vaccines and promoting unproven treatments. Florida saw 2,933,782 cases of COVID-19 and 23,352 deaths in 2021, compared to 1,317,300 cases and 39,877 deaths in 2020.\n\nJanuary 2022: Senate Democrats all walked out of Ladapo's confirmation hearing before the Senate Health Policy Committee after what they said was a lack of honest answers about his qualifications and the current state of the pandemic during a lengthy interview.\n\nAt a press conference that month, DeSantis and Ladapo told Floridians who weren't showing symptoms not to get tested. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have symptoms, you are not a case,\" Ladapo said despite CDC guidance saying that asymptomatic people with COVID can still pass it on to more vulnerable people and they may still develop debilitating long COVID themselves weeks later.\n\nFebruary 2022: During his confirmation hearing Ladapo dodged questions about vaccine effectiveness, how much time he actually spent at UF, whether he had been vaccinated himself, and his connections with \"fringe medical group\" America\u2019s Frontline Doctors. He was ultimately confirmed along party lines.\n\nApril 2022: Ladapo's FDOH cited a study by an Australian pediatrician to support restricting transgender health care. The pediatrician, Dr. Ken Pang, strongly objected to the medical board, saying his research was misrepresented and showed exactly the opposite. \"To be seeing the research we've done being utilized in this way \u2014 I was just dismayed by that,\u201d Pang told VICE.com.\n\nJune 2022: DeSantis and the FDOH, under Ladapo, refused to pre-order COVID-19 vaccines for children under five when they became available, the only U.S. state to do so, citing the lack of need and the risks. Ladapo appeared before Congress to defend the state's decision and said the state didn't recommend vaccines for children under 18.\n\nOctober 2022: Ladapo urged men younger than 40 to avoid the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccine and booster shots because of the \"abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men in this age group,\" citing an anonymous non-peer-reviewed analysis from the FDOH. The move prompted a backlash from doctors, researchers and the federal government. At the time, Florida was leading the country in COVID deaths for the third month in a row.\n\nJanuary 2023: A task force of UF medical school doctors concluded that the FDOH recommendation against COVID vaccines for young men was of \u201chighly questionable merit\" and that Ladapo cherry-picked data to support his stance. Politico went further and, after examining different drafts of the analysis, reported that Ladapo had personally changed the study to remove data that contradicted his views. Ladapo has denied this.\n\nMarch 2023: In response to a letter from Ladapo demanding answers based on his own research on vaccine safety, the FDA and CDC asked him to stop disproportionally focusing on the small number of adverse effects in the studies of 13 billion COVID shots given around the world while ignoring the number of people the vaccines have saved. \"Unfortunately, the misinformation about COVID-19 vaccine safety has caused some Americans to avoid getting the vaccines they need to be up to date,\" the letter reads.\n\nApril 2023: The FDOH under Ladapo stopped reporting COVID infections and deaths to the federal government\n\nSeptember 2023: Ladapo recommended against anyone under the age of 65 getting the new COVID-19 vaccine booster the FDA approved to combat new, more infectious variants, directly contradicting CDC guidance. He claimed that the mRNA boosters altered human DNA, which the CDC and multiple studies have said is false.\n\nNovember 2023: After a two-year battle over COVID public records, the FDOH under Ladapo settled a lawsuit about withholding COVID data and released information spanning the entire duration of the pandemic on the state's FLHealthCHARTS.gov site. However, the agency also stopped providing cumulative totals, percentages, new case positivity, data on booster doses and overviews that made it easier to see trends. Cases in Florida hit a new high of 3,071,567 in 2022 but the death rate dropped, with 21,320 deaths reported.\n\nJanuary 2024: Ladapo made headlines again by \"calling for a halt to the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\" because he said he didn't receive an adequate response from the FDA about the safety of vaccines. Meanwhile, Florida was seeing a spike in new COVID cases and hospitalizations.\n\nFebruary 2024: After six children at Manatee Baty Elementary School in Westin caught measles, Ladapo sent a letter to parents saying it was \"normally recommended\" for unvaccinated children who have not previously had the disease to be kept home for three weeks \"because of the high likelihood\" they would get infected. But he also said the state would not mandate such a move, saying the Florida Department of Health was \"deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance.\"\n\nMeasles is considered one of the most contagious infections for humans, according to Dr. Aileen Marty, a professor at Florida International University and an expert in infectious disease and disaster medicine. If a person with measles comes in contact with a group of unvaccinated people, there is a 90% chance of the unvaccinated person becoming ill, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nSeptember 2024: Florida pediatricians reported that vaccination levels in the state are getting dangerously low, increasing the risk of outbreaks of diseases that are otherwise preventable. Ladapo issued a statement warning Floridians against getting the new COVID-19 vaccine, using the same anti-mRNA arguments the FDA rebutted the year before.\n\nOctober 2024: The FDOH under Ladapo sent out a cease-and-desist order to at least two television stations over what it called misrepresentations of the state's abortion laws in a political ad for a constitutional amendment. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under former President Joe Biden called the letter a \"flagrant abuse of power\" that \"must be rejected.\" The group behind the amendment filed a federal lawsuit against Ladapo, accusing him of violating its First Amendment rights.\n\nNovember 2024: Ladapo asked Florida residents to call their legislators and demand them to stop adding fluoride to public drinking water, saying the practice is tantamount to \"public health malpractice.\" U.S. health experts strongly disagreedm but several cities ended the practice and the Florida Legislature banned it in 2025.\n\nMarch 2025: In a press conference reporting the first measles case in Florida in 225, Ladapo reiterated that measles vaccines are available for children, but decisions about whether to give a child the vaccine, or whether to send an unvaccinated child to school, should be left to parents. As of Aug. 30, six cases have been reported in the state, according to FDOH data.\n\nApril 2025: Ladapo speaks at a \"Freedom Fest\" event in Sarasota denouncing Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who was a key member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.\n\nAugust 2025: A few days after 21 people were sickened (six of them under age 10) and seven people were hospitalized with severe complications after consuming raw (unpasteurized) milk from a Florida farm, Ladapo said that \"Floridians have the freedom to make informed health choices\" and that he supported the decision to consume it. Human consumption of raw milk, which has not been heated to neutralize harmful bacteria, is legal in Florida but selling it for human consumption is not.",

  "summary": "Florida officials have announced plans to end all state vaccine requirements, including those for school attendance, a move that has been strongly opposed by major medical groups who warn of increased risks for preventable diseases. The move comes as Florida has seen a decrease in vaccination rates and a rise in diseases like whooping cough and measles. Dr. Joseph Ladapo, Florida's surgeon general, and Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the end of all vaccine mandates at a press conference on Sept. 3. Ladapo plans to repeal about a half-dozen vaccine requirements controlled by the Florida Department of Health and DeSantantis, and the Florida Legislature will also repeal other vaccinations required under state law such as polio, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, tetanus and other communicable diseases. A study showed that infant mortality rates have decreased over the last 50 years and access to vaccines have resulted in a 40% lower infant mortality rate. The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other health professionals were quick to speak out against the move.",

      "text": "Florida Department of Health rejects complaint against Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo\nCritic said Ladapo publicly said things about COVID-19 he knew to be false\nThe Florida Department of Health rejected a complaint alleging that Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo violated state medical laws by publicly casting doubts about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and promoting unproven treatments against the disease.\n\u201cWe have determined from our review that we can take no further action because the healthcare provider has not violated any laws or rules regulating this profession,\u201d Investigation Manager Anthony Jusevitch told Dr. Howard Goldman in a letter dated Nov. 22.\nGoldman, a Delray Beach eye doctor, filed a complaint Oct. 29 claiming that Ladapo, also head of the Department of Health, made public pronouncements about COVID-19 that he knew to be false.\n\u201cWhat he did may not be a violation of specific laws, but in my opinion (it) is a violation of medical ethics,\u201d he said. \u201cMy point was not that he broke any laws, only that he was spreading medical misinformation based on current medical/scientific knowledge and requested that he be censured for this, not arrested.\u201d\nMore coverage of Florida's surgeon general, powered by the USA TODAY Network-Florida:\n- South Florida doctor files complaint against Ladapo with Florida state Board of Medicine\n- 'Grave concerns': Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo's medical license OK'd in two days\n- How much does Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo make? Compare other state workers here\n- DeSantis mega-donor, UF Board of Trustees chair supplied Ladapo's resume, fast-tracking surgeon general's hire\n- Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show\nSeveral nationwide organizations, including one that has certified Ladapo in internal medicine, have come down hard in recent months on health care practitioners who spread misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine or promote unproven alternative treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.\nThe DOH would not confirm or deny if a complaint against Ladapo even existed: \"If the Department receives a complaint and does not find sufficient information (probable cause) to further investigate the complaint, then the complaint would never be public record,\" DOH spokeswoman Weesam Khoury said in an email.\nProbable cause in this context means it is more likely than not that someone violated state law governing the practice of medicine.\nChristina Pushaw, the press secretary for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said the only possible motive for filing a complaint questioning Ladapo's medical competence would be political.\n\"It\u2019s regrettable that Dr. Ladapo has faced an onslaught of unfair personal attacks from the day his appointment was announced,\" Pushaw said.\nLadapo \u201cis using his bully pulpit to spread doubt about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, promoting the use of unproven and possibly dangerous medications like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin,\u201d Goldman said.\nBecause of those statements by Ladapo, Goldman added, people have been reluctant to seek appropriate care and treatment for COVID-19.\nSince he was appointed surgeon general on Sept. 21, Ladapo has said the COVID-19 vaccine is not as effective or as safe as the mainstream medical community and media make it out to be, and that media outlets are not reporting the real number of breakthrough cases among those who have been vaccinated.\nHe also refused to wear a mask when asked by a state senator who informed him she was being treated for a serious medical condition, saying he couldn\u2019t communicate effectively with a mask over his mouth.\nBackground:\n- Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo asked to leave meeting after refusing to wear mask\n- Florida Surgeon General Ladapo says he can't 'communicate effectively' in his refusal to wear mask in Polsky's office\nOver a year ago, Ladapo stood on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., with a group of physicians calling themselves America\u2019s Frontline Doctors.\nThe group\u2019s members have made millions selling hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug also used for some autoimmune diseases, and ivermectin, an anti-parasitic, to patients as a treatment against COVID, as reported by The Intercept, Time magazine and other media outlets. Those reports prompted a congressional investigation.\nNeither drug has been approved for use by the FDA against infection from COVID, and tests have proven hydroxychloroquine to have no therapeutic benefits against the disease, as USA TODAY and other outlets have reported.\nThe Federation of State Medical Boards issued a statement warning that doctors who spread COVID-19 misinformation should face disciplinary action by their state medical boards.\nThey \u201cpossess a high degree of public trust and have a powerful platform in society,\u201d the FSMB said, and have an ethical responsibility to share factual, scientifically accurate and consensus-driven information.\n\u201cSpreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility, threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk,\u201d the FSMB added.\nMoreover, a joint statement by the American Board of Family Medicine, American Board of Internal Medicine and American Board of Pediatrics warned that such unethical and unprofessional conduct could put their board certification at risk, too.\nLadapo is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine.\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "New Florida surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo stands apart, agrees with governor on COVID policy\nPeople can disagree with his views, one expert said, but Ladapo is 'worthy of listening to'\nFlorida's new surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, embraces views on COVID so extreme that he would make a disclaimer before interviews and public speaking events that his views were his own and not those of his former employer \u2014 the University of California, Los Angeles.\nThe Harvard Medical School grad has written over a dozen articles in the Wall Street Journal, USA TODAY, and the New York Daily News expressing views that are controversial and antithetical to those of the medical mainstream. Those include promoting the benefits of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin against COVID, and criticizing the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine, mask mandates and lockdowns.\nHe also has been associated with extremist groups including America's Frontline Doctors, a right-wing group known for spreading misinformation about the pandemic, and the Tea Party Patriots Action, a conservative anti-mandate group.\nWhat we know: Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo\nAnd he is a signatory of the Great Barrington Declaration, which criticized most pandemic mitigation measures in favor of natural, or \"herd,\" immunity.\nRead more:\n- Scott Rivkees relinquishes Florida surgeon general role, returns to academia at UF\n- 'Fear is done': Florida's new surgeon general outspoken critic of COVID lockdowns, mandates\n- 'America's Frontline Doctors' may be real doctors, but experts say they don't know what they're talking about\n- Coronavirus pandemic: We were caught unprepared. It is too late for shutdowns to save us\nBut his views on managing the COVID pandemic are also in line with the views of Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, who tapped him to be the state's surgeon general and Health Department head as the state begins to recover from a devastating summer surge that claimed the lives of 51,000 Floridians.\nLadapo's views in line with Ron DeSantis\nHis first move, in a state that has been the epicenter of an outbreak in pediatric cases as well as the delta variant, was to double down on pushing parental choice in whether kids should wear masks at school.\nThe order he signed on his second day on the job also gave parents the choice to send their children to school after they become exposed to COVID-19, stripping local school districts of the power to quarantine kids for at least 4 days.\nThe move had the full support of DeSantis, who praised Ladapo's background and credentials, which include years of cardiovascular research, a Ph.D. in health policy, and over 100 published scholarly articles.\nThus far, Ladapo has referred questions to spokespeople.\n\"Dr. Ladapo is a critical and independent thinker. He does not take dogma at face value,\" Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a clinical professor of public health at the Kech School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, said in an email to the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.\nThe two have spent the last two years working together on policy activities related to COVID-19, Klausner said, and believes Ladapo to be open-minded, incorruptible, a fast learner who loves to read, and \"an ideal selection\" as Florida's surgeon general.\nSome doctors say Ladapo is wrong on masks in schools\nBut other colleagues in the medical and academic community immediately took to social media to criticize Ladapo's views and condemn his appointment.\n\"I'm speechless,\" said Dr. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock, the founder of Advancing Health Equity, and one of the leading speakers on bias and racism in health care. \"I attended medical school with Dr. Joseph Ladapo and to say I'm shocked by his opposition to mask and vaccine mandates is an understatement. I could have never imagined this news.\"\nBlackstock and fellow Harvard Medical alum Dr. Maurice Sholas spoke out against Ladapo\u2019s COVID strategy.\nAs Black doctors practicing medicine, they are concerned about his COVID strategies, especially in light of the way the disease has ripped through minority communities. Those same communities have a higher tendency toward vaccine reluctance and distrust in medicine.\n\u201cThe dead and ill speak volumes and it is a shame what he is willing to do to have a moment in the sun,\u201d Sholas said.\nLadapo, who was born in Nigeria to a biomedical researcher, is also Black. He moved to the U.S. when he was five.\nSeveral of Ladapo's colleagues at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine and Ronald Reagan Hospital, where he worked and taught since 2016, also took to social media to criticize his hiring and to warn Floridians. Some did not respond to requests for interviews.\n\u201cHe\u2019s expressed a lot of strange views since the beginning of the pandemic,\u201d Dr. Nida Qadir, an associate professor of medicine and associate director of the Medical Intensive Care Unit at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, tweeted.\nShe said she didn't know him personally, but was shocked by his views considering what Los Angeles went through last winter during the pandemic: \"Can\u2019t say I\u2019m not happy he\u2019s leaving CA but sorry for the people of FL,\u201d she tweeted.\nDr. Russell Glenn Burh, a pulmonary and critical care physician with UCLA Heath and an assistant professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine, criticized Ladapo's \"libertarian approach\" to public health for communicable diseases.\n\"Dr. Ladapo insists that public health leadership has been conflating science with politics but he\u2019s the one ignoring best practices on infection control to please the governor,\" Burh tweeted.\nDr. Nina L. Shapiro, an author and associate professor at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tweeted that his views align \"more with #DeSantis than with @UCLAHealth.\"\nIn return, Ladapo has been critical of many of his colleagues who embrace the prevailing winds on COVID response. \u201cPeople have been taking the science and misrepresenting it,\u201d Ladapo said.\nLadapo 'exquisitely qualified' to be Florida surgeon general\nLadapo's resume shows he has a long list of credentials and scholarly articles under his belt. He received his medical degree and Ph.D. in health policy from Harvard University in 2008.\nHe spent time as a faculty member at NYU's School of Medicine, and was a staff fellow with the Food and Drug Administration 2012-14 under President Obama. He was hired at UCLA in 2016 and became a tenured professor in 2020.\nHe's written over 100 scholarly and scientific articles, many of which focus on cost-effectiveness of diagnostic technologies, cardiovascular health, smoking cessation and HIV.\n\"He's exquisitely qualified for this role,\" Stefan Baral, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in an interview with USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida. \"To say he is not a qualified or credentialed scientist is fundamentally untrue.\"\nPeople can disagree with his views, Baral added, but Ladapo is \"worthy of listening to what he has to say and I think he's earned the right to contribute to the conversation.\"\nThe two have not met in person but have spent the last six to eight weeks collaborating on an article focused on \"drawing lessons learned from COVID-19 in terms of improving upon pandemic preparedness and responding to public health emergencies of international concern,\" Baral said.\nLadapo also signed an open letter Baral co-authored last October to university administrators calling for a humane approach to students during the COVID crisis.\nBaral was troubled by the narrative he's seen critical of Ladapo for not being an epidemiologist, noting that he's done epidemiological research in the context of health policy related to COVID.\nHe also said Ladapo is taking a cost-benefit analysis of vaccination and balancing it with the needs of children to have a safe place where they can get a school lunch and other benefits.\nBaral said he was aware of Ladapo's friendship with Stanford professor Jay Bhattacharya, co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration. And he knew of Ladapo's participation in last summer's America's Frontline Doctors news conference on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, an event sponsored by Tea Party Patriots.\nThe group's co-founder Simone Gold, who has introduced Ladapo as a friend at other events, was indicted in connection with the Jan. 6 Capital riots.\nGold, Ladapo and other doctors, some with dubious credentials, appeared in lab coats on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court building last July to tout hydoxychloroquine as a treatment against COVID-19, a drug that DeSantis also touted last year.\nOne of the participants was Dr. Stella Immanuel, who has stated that some ailments are caused by \"demon sperm\" and that alien DNA is used in some medical treatments.\nThe organization has put out literature skeptical of the COVID vaccine, and Ladapo himself has said it is no more special than any other form of prevention.\n\"I hope he's not anti-vaccine,\" Baral said. \"I would never co-author anything with someone who is anti-vaccine.\"\nBaral also believes Ladapo is well aware of the ramifications of taking such a highly visible job with DeSantis, who has political aspirations beyond the governor's office.\n\"He's not an idiot,\" Baral said. \"He understands what this job is about, he's cognizant of the association with DeSantis.\"\nDespite the political trappings that come with the job, Baral said he believes Ladapo wants to truly serve the public.\n\"If he wanted to make money, he'd go into pharma,\" Baral said. \"What do you think the motivation is, other than serving the community?\"\nDaniel Halperin, an adjunct full professor of global public health at University of North Carolina\u2013Chapel Hill, also hasn't met Ladapo in person but has conversed with him by email and over the phone at some length about the pandemic.\n\"He is deeply concerned about how some of the measures being taken may be causing a lot of suffering out there,\" Halperin said in an email to the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.\nLadapo, a father of 3, not a 'denialist'\nLadapo, who has three young children, is very concerned about being affected medically by the virus, so he clearly isn't a \"denialist,\" Halperin added.\n\"For example, he sent me an email early this year, when southern California was experiencing its worst surge, and he was very concerned about that at the time,\" he said.\nBottom line, Halperin said, Ladapo believes that too many public health policy decisions have been made out of an extreme sense of fear that too often borders on panic.\n\"I believe he has compassion for people broadly, including those who are making such decisions, but he also passionately believes that the road to hell is paved with good intentions,\" Halperin said.\n\"In other words, that (means) some well-meaning decisions ... have inadvertently caused more harm than good, and thus he feels called upon to help right the ship.\"\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "Fact check: Ivermectin is not a proven treatment for COVID-19\nThe claim: Ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19\nSeveral states have logged 1 million coronavirus cases as the highly contagious delta variant continues to wreak havoc across the country. To slow the spread of the virus, public health officials are encouraging Americans to get vaccinated.\nBut on social media, some have hatched a different plan to treat COVID-19: using anti-parasite products designed for farm animals.\n\"Less than a hour after taking Ivermectin paste per my body weight I was mostly symptom free,\" reads an Aug. 8 testimonial on Facebook. \"Was in bad shape until then!\"\nThe post, which includes a photo of an apple-flavored paste for treating parasites in horses, only accumulated about 200 shares within three days. But similar posts touting ivermectin have been widely shared across platforms, and farm supply stores across the country are running low on anti-parasitics for horses, cows and pigs.\n\"(Hydroxychloroquine) and treatments like ivermectin cure coronavirus within days. Always has,\" an Instagram user wrote Aug. 4.\nThey don't.\nFact check: Fauci's emails don't show he 'lied' about hydroxychloroquine\n\"There is no evidence that ivermectin is effective for treatment,\" Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an assistant professor at the Medical University of South Carolina, said in an email.\nUSA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment. One of them, Shayne Ward, said in a Facebook message that he's heard \"countless stories of people that Ivermectin has helped get over Covid.\"\n\"Fact Check that!\" he wrote.\nIvermectin not proven to treat COVID-19\nIvermectin has been promoted as a COVID-19 cure throughout the pandemic. Scientists are still studying whether the drug could be used as a treatment, but so far there's little data to suggest it's effective against COVID-19.\nIvermectin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat certain kinds of parasites and neglected tropical diseases, including scabies and parasitic worms. It is not approved to treat any viruses.\nSome limited studies have suggested ivermectin could help treat COVID-19. But other, more rigorous research has found little or no impact.\n\"The reason for the interest in ivermectin is that studies in the lab have shown it can block viruses from multiplying in experimental settings \u2013 i.e. in a petri dish \u2013 and so people hoped this would mean it could help treat COVID-19 in people too,\" Dr. Denise McCulloch, an infectious disease specialist with the University of Washington's School of Medicine, said in an email. \"Unfortunately, the few high-quality studies that have been done to date do not demonstrate a beneficial effect of ivermectin when it is used in people with COVID-19.\"\nTwo of the highest-quality studies available include a double-blind, randomized trial in Colombia and a meta-analysis of 14 studies involving more than 1,600 participants, McCulloch said.\nMore: What science has learned works and what doesn\u2019t in COVID-19 treatments\nThe Colombia study found that, among adults with mild COVID-19 cases, a five-day course of ivermectin \"did not significantly improve the time to resolution of symptoms.\" The meta-analysis, published in late July, concluded that \"the reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID\u201019 outside of well\u2010designed randomized trials.\"\nThose findings have been clouded by the publication of lower-quality studies and research with potential sources of bias, experts say.\nOne non-peer reviewed study widely cited by ivermectin proponents was posted on Research Square in November. The preprint platform withdrew the study in July \"due to an expression of concern communicated directly to our staff.\"\nA peer-reviewed meta-analysis of 15 trials, published in the July/August issue of the American Journal of Therapeutics, found that \"large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin.\" But experts told PolitiFact, an independent fact-checking outlet, that some of the trials the study included were not high-quality, and some of its authors were affiliated with a pro-ivermectin group.\nAbsent more randomized, controlled clinical trials, scientists remain skeptical about the benefits of ivermectin in treating COVID-19.\n\"To extrapolate from how much drug is needed to work in the test tube to how much is required to work in a human being against the virus makes these trials and all the meta-reviews published less than worthless \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous,\" Dr. Benhur Lee, a microbiology professor at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, said in an email.\nOfficials say drug should 'only be used within clinical trials'\nPublic health officials and pharmaceutical companies have advised against taking ivermectin to treat COVID-19.\nThe FDA said in April 2020 that people should not take ivermectin unless it's \"prescribed to them by a licensed health care provider and is obtained through a legitimate source.\" The agency reiterated that position in March.\nFact check: 6 of the most persistent misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccines\n\"The FDA has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients to treat or to prevent COVID-19; however, some initial research is underway,\" the FDA says on its website. \"Taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous.\"\nThe FDA warns that ivermectin products for animals can be toxic to humans due to their high concentration of the drug. ABC News reported in February that there had been an uptick in calls to poison control centers related to ivermectin.\nThe World Health Organization has also warned against using ivermectin to treat COVID-19, saying the drug should \"only be used within clinical trials.\" Merck, the pharmaceutical company that makes ivermectin, said in February it had found \"no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies.\"\nClinical trials studying whether ivermectin could be used to treat COVID-19 are ongoing. Until those trials conclude, experts told USA TODAY it's tough to say with certainty how the drug affects COVID-19 patients.\nOur rating: Missing context\nBased on our research, the claim that ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19 is MISSING CONTEXT. Scientists are still studying whether ivermectin could be used to treat COVID-19. While some studies have shown promise, experts say the more scientifically rigorous studies conducted to date more frequently find no connection between use of ivermectin and improved COVID-19 recoveries.

      "text": "Fact check: Hydroxychloroquine has not worked in treating COVID-19, studies show\nThe claim: Hydroxychloroquine has worked through the entirety of the pandemic\nSince it made its social media debut in late March, hydroxychloroquine has become a contentious topic in an already polarized pandemic debate.\nPoliticians, health officials and scientists have trumpeted various opinions on hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness, ranging from miracle drug to potentially harmful and dangerous.\nA Facebook post on what is described as the personal page of Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano claims the drug has been useful in the fight against COVID-19. The post has more than 1,700 shares.\nThe post is a screenshot of a tweet by David Samadi, a urologist who regularly makes TV appearances, including on Fox News as a medical expert: \"I want to ensure that everyone understands the gravity of the situation here. Hydroxychloroquine worked this whole time. The media said it would literally kill you if you took it simply because POTUS promoted it as a cure. Thousands of people likely DIED because of this.\"\nUSA TODAY is awaiting comment from Mastriano. The tweet was also widely shared on Facebook and Instagram by other users.\nFirst, there was tree bark\nTo understand hydroxychloroquine, it is necessary to trace its historical roots.\nThe drug was originally derived from the cinchona tree, commonly used by the ancient Incas of South America to combat fevers. By the 1600s, either Spanish doctors or Jesuit priests \u2013 the accounts vary \u2013 were introduced to the bark's fever-reducing properties and imported it to Europe in 1630.\nIt took nearly two centuries for the essential medicinal compound to be discovered. In 1820, French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaim\u00e9 Caventou purified quinine from the bark and constructed a factory in Paris for its production. The new drug gained traction in the medical community and was used to treat malaria-related fevers.\nAs European colonial territories grew during the early 19th century, so did the need for quinine. The British used it as a malaria prophylaxis in 1848, spending nearly \u00a353,000 annually to import cinchona bark to its colonies in Asia and Africa. Spending dropped in 1861, when they started planting the tree in India. Around the same time, the Dutch began growing their own cinchona in Java and elsewhere in southeast Asia, eventually establishing the region as the center of the quinine industry.\nFact check: 'Thousands' of doctors have not said hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19\nThe search for alternatives\nWhen the Netherlands fell under German occupation in 1940, and Java fell to the Japanese in 1942, production of quinine came to a halt. Before World War II, the Germans developed a synthetic antimalarial drug chemically known as quinacrine and trademarked as Atabrine. It had an unpleasant side effect of turning skin and the whites of eyes yellow; the Germans promptly abandoned it, deeming it too toxic for human use.\nThe United States acquired Atabrine's patent and made aggressive efforts in synthesizing an improved drug. In 1943, the U.S. Army discovered the derivative compound chloroquine. In 1946, hydroxychloroquine was synthesized, and in 1955, it was proposed as a safer alternative to its chemical predecessor.\nInitial studies on hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19\nIn the mid- to late-20th century, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were formidable in treating autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous \u2013 a common type of lupus for which there is no cure \u2013 and rheumatoid arthritis.\nIts role against COVID-19 was popularized by a French study on March 20, which found the antimalarial drug, in combination with antibiotic azithromycin, was \"significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients.\"\nPresident Donald Trump took to Twitter on March 21 to declare hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as the \"biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\"\nMedical experts and policymakers, desperate to turn the pandemic's tide and propelled by hype, jumped on the bandwagon. The FDA approved emergency use of the drug in late March, and many states and countries kickstarted their own clinical trials. Among them was the World Health Organization with its Solidarity Trial.\nThe early evidence was found to be flawed. On March 23, three statisticians published a review of the French study and found it overstated hydroxychloroquine's benefit by citing Chinese sources that lacked real evidence.\n\"The first was a letter that doesn't report any trial data, but instead refers to a conference held in February, during which participants ('experts from the government and regulatory authorities and organizers of clinical trials') seemingly agreed that chloroquine was an efficacious treatment for COVID-19,\" Dr. Tim Morris and colleagues wrote. The second source referred to a number of Chinese clinical trials \u2013 mostly suspended or closed at the time the review was written \u2013 that were still recruiting and had no available data available as of March 21.\nMorris and his colleagues found the study had design and ethical concerns. They pointed to the lack of randomization, as well as an inappropriate control group composed partly of people who did not consent to take the drug. Participants were dropped from the French study's analysis, including those who had bad outcomes (\"admission to ICU or death\"). This omission, Morris and colleagues wrote, \"made the treated group\u2019s outcomes look better.\"\nIn April, the organization behind the journal that published the French study announced it did not meet the group's \"expected standard.\" An analysis in May found the French study to be \"quick and dirty ... as methodologists would legitimately say, with poor quality reporting and several biases.\" Independent research groups, in China and elsewhere in France, attempting to replicate the study's methods arrived at the same conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine provided no clinical benefit at all.\nFact check: No mask? You can ask why \u2013 it isn\u2019t against HIPAA or the Fourth or Fifth Amendments\nRecent studies show drug doesn't help\nThis ineffectiveness would arise regularly in later research efforts. Last month, RECOVERY, a large British clinical trial investigating hydroxychloroquine treatment in hospitalized patients, found no significant difference in mortality after 28 days, or hospital outcomes between patients given the drug and those not.\n\"There has been huge speculation and uncertainty about the role of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, but an absence of reliable information from large randomised trials. Today\u2019s preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial are quite clear \u2013 hydroxychloroquine does not reduce the risk of death among hospitalised patients with this new disease,\" said Dr. Martin Landry, chief investigator of the trial and professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health, in a news release.\nOther research efforts investigating hydroxychloroquine as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis found no compelling evidence. In a New England Journal of Medicine study published last month, Dr. David Boulware of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and colleagues gave COVID-19-exposed, non-hospitalized individuals hydroxychloroquine or a placebo. Of people who took the drug, 12% developed COVID-19 symptoms versus 14% in the placebo group, a difference not considered statistically significant.\nThe pharmaceutical giant behind the antiviral remdesivir, Gilead, released data on a study involving remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine.\n\"The rates and likelihood of recovery were lower in patients who received concomitant hydroxychloroquine compared with patients treated with remdesivir who did not receive hydroxychloroquine,\" the company announced in a news release July 10.\nOn June 15, the FDA revoked the drug's emergency use status \"in certain hospitalized patients when a clinical trial is unavailable or participation is not feasible.\" The agency cited the large, randomized clinical trials that showed hydroxychloroquine offered no benefit in preventing death or speeding recovery. In early July, the agency released a statement warning of \"serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure\" associated with hydroxychloroquine use.\nDespite the FDA's revocation and the growing body of evidence not in favor of hydroxychloroquine, studies on its utility continue.\nA study this month out of the Henry Ford Hospital System in southeast Michigan found death rates were 50% lower among the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. The study's authors noted the drug posed no safety problems. The research was criticized as an observational study \u2013 much less rigorous than a randomized trial \u2013 and because patients who received hydroxychloroquine also got steroids shown to be clinically beneficial in treating COVID-19.\n\u201cYou want to look at the totality of the data,\u201d said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cThe totality is overwhelmingly in the opposite direction. You have to conclude with the Henry Ford study is an outlier, and there\u2019s some kind of confounder that is skewing the data and not representing the truth.\u201d\nFact check: ADA does not provide blanket exemption from face mask requirements\nOur ruling: False\nWe rate the claim that hydroxychloroquine has worked through the entirety of the pandemic as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. Several reputable randomized control studies \u2013 the highest tier in research \u2013 such as the U.K.'s RECOVERY trial found no evidence to suggest hydroxychloroquine saved lives. Studies that showed hydroxychloroquine as beneficial were flawed or, like the Henry Ford study, included another medication helpful against COVID-19. Anecdotes of hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness are not comparable or equivalent to large studies and need further scrutiny. Considering the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine intake, it has the potential to put lives at risk of severe heart problems and other issues, according to the FDA.\nOur fact-check sources:\n- STAT News: \"Debate over hydroxychloroquine spills over from the White House to congressional campaigns.\"\n- Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine: \"Evaluating Cinchona bark and quinine for treating and preventing malaria.\"\n- Scientific American: \"Quinine and Empire.\"\n- Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine: \"Hydroxychloroquine: An old drug with new relevance.\"\n- Pharmacy in History: \"The National Quinine Pool: When Quinine Went to War.\"\n- Healthline: \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).\"\n- Donald J.

      "text": "Measles in Florida: Doctors urge vaccinations, saying South Florida's two cases could grow\nThe U.S. thought it had eradicated measles 25 years ago. Now the highly contagious disease is back, spiking to more than 1,200 cases already in 2025.\n- The U.S. is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in over 30 years, with 1,288 cases confirmed as of July 8, 2025.\n- Four cases have been confirmed in Florida, two in South Florida, and the majority of cases are linked to an outbreak in Texas.\n- Doctors are concerned about the potential for further spread due to summer travel and vaccine hesitancy.\n- Measles is a highly contagious airborne virus, and vaccination is considered the most effective protection.\n- Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective in preventing measles.\nThe United States has recorded its highest number of cases of measles since the highly contagious disease was declared to be eliminated in the country 25 years ago, raising concerns among local doctors about whether South Florida could soon see a rise in cases.\nTo date, health officials have not confirmed any cases in Palm Beach County, but they have confirmed four across Florida this year, two of them in South Florida, according to the Florida Department of Health. Broward and Miami-Dade counties each have one confirmed case in 2025. The other two have been in Leon County, home to Tallahassee.\nCases within Palm Beach County have been extremely rare, with the Florida Department of Health reporting that the last known case locally was in June 2000. It was the only case reported that year, the health department said.\nHowever, local doctors said measles outbreaks in other states this year could increase the chances for exposure in less-affected areas as more people begin to travel for the summer. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there had been 1,288 confirmed measles cases in the U.S. as of July 8, marking the nation's largest outbreak in more than 30 years.\n\u27a4 Access The Palm Beach Post on the go with the app: Our app offers a personalized experience to your liking. Download our app to personalize your news alerts, swipe and scroll through stories faster, and bookmark them to save and read later.\nThe majority of cases are linked to a large outbreak that originated in west Texas. The CDC said other cases arose from community transmission or during travel. Some of the spread may be tied to a movement within the U.S. that has questioned the safety of vaccines and whether those vaccines are even necessary.\n\"I am unaware of any cases in Palm Beach County up until now, which is good,\" said Dr. Chad Sanborn, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at West Boca Medical Center and the Palm Beach Children's Hospital at St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach.\n\"Hopefully, it stays that way, but I think there's a fair to good chance that that won't stay that way,\" he said. \"We're seeing outbreaks (in other states) ... It's summertime, so people are traveling all about the United States and internationally, and we know that the immunization rates in Palm Beach County aren't as high as they used to be.\n\"So I do have a concern that we can and will see some cases here in Palm Beach.\"\nVaccination is best way to protect self against measles, doctors say\nMeasles is an airborne, extremely infectious and potentially severe respiratory illness that is caused by a virus. The disease can remain airborne for up to two hours, meaning that someone could contract it without coming into direct contact with a carrier.\nIt is so contagious that 92% of unvaccinated people who are exposed end up contracting the disease. And one in five of those people end up in the hospital, according to the CDC.\nCommon symptoms include a high fever that may reach more than 104 degrees, a cough, a runny nose, and red, watery eyes. A rash generally appears three to five days after symptoms begin.\nThis year's outbreak has resulted in 162 hospitalizations and three confirmed deaths across the nation. Children account for two of the deaths.\nHealth officials declared measles eliminated from the United States in 2000, meaning there were no measles cases spreading within the country and new cases were only found when someone contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S.\nDr. Minu Mathew, an infectious diseases specialist at HCA Florida Palms West Medical Center, said vaccine hesitancy has become a growing concern in the medical community, particularly since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may likely have contributed to the current outbreak.\n\"I think the main point is this is a vaccine-preventable disease,\" she said. \"If you get the two doses, the first one is at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second one at 4 to 6 years, you have a 97 percent protection. So it's mostly about weighing the risk versus the benefit because you could be seriously ill if you get it.\"\nThis year's outbreak marks the highest total nationally since 1992, when more than 2,000 cases were reported, and surpasses a similar outbreak in 2019, when 1,274 cases were recorded, according to CDC statistics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s concerning for us in the infectious disease world, and the pediatrics world and the medical world in general,\" Sanborn said.\nHe stressed the importance of vaccinations for children, noting that about a third of children under the age of 5 who contract the measles are likely to end up in the hospital. Nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, according to CDC statistics.\n\"My big message to families would be is that I am a strong proponent of all childhood vaccinations,\" Sanborn said. \"I encourage families that have concerns about getting the MMR vaccine to speak to their pediatrician. To speak to the people that they trust to get good information, because it is a safe vaccine.\"\nThose with questions about measles vaccine should contact their doctor\nThe CDC considers people who have received two doses of the vaccine as children to be protected for life. It advises those unsure about their immunity status to first try to find their vaccination records or documentation of measles immunity, the agency said.\nIt recommends that those without written documentation of immunity get vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, or MMR, saying there is no harm in receiving another dose, even if a person may be immune.\nSanborn said that those with questions regarding their vaccination status should discuss the matter with their doctor.\nMaterial from USA TODAY contributed to this story.\nJulius Whigham II is a criminal justice and public safety reporter for The Palm Beach Post.

      "text": "Florida Surgeon General Ladapo contradicts feds, recommends against mRNA COVID shots\nFlorida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo took the extraordinary step Wednesday of \"calling for a halt to the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,\" a move that contradicts federal health authorities and again makes Florida an outlier.\nLadapo said in a statement released by the Florida Department of Health that he raised questions about the safety of the vaccines with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and they did not provide an adequate response. As a result, he said, he is now recommending against their use.\nThe FDA's response to Ladapo, dated last month, rebutted each of his concerns and warns that vaccine \"misinformation and disinformation\" will result in fewer people getting vaccinated, which contributes to the \"continued death and serious illness toll of COVID-19.\"\nA favorite of Gov. Ron DeSantis, Ladapo is a controversial figure who repeatedly has criticized COVID-19 vaccines and issued increasingly stringent recommendations urging various populations not to get them, despite assurances by federal authorities they are safe.\nIn 2022, Ladapo made Florida the first state in the nation to recommend against healthy children receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. Then last year he recommended against anyone under the age of 65 getting new COVID vaccine boosters.\nLadapo's latest recommendation is his most drastic yet, targeting some of the most popular vaccines such as those made by Pfizer and Moderna. Ladapo's letter to the FDA raises concerns about \"the risks of contaminant DNA integration into human DNA\" through the messenger RNA vaccine and \"the integrity of the human genome.\u201d\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, is a molecule that delivers genetic information from DNA to proteins. DNA \"is the molecule that carries genetic information for the development and functioning of an organism,\" according to the National Human Genome Research Institute.\nVaccines do not alter DNA, feds say\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says mRNA vaccines do not alter an individual's DNA: \"None of the COVID-19 vaccines affect or interact with our DNA.\"\nThe FDA letter responding to Ladapo says, \"We would like to make clear that based on a thorough assessment of the entire manufacturing process, FDA is confident in the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines.\"\nIt continues, \"The agency\u2019s benefit-risk assessment and ongoing safety surveillance demonstrate that the benefits of their use outweigh their risks. Additionally, with over a billion doses of the mRNA vaccines administered, no safety concerns related to residual DNA have been identified.\"\nLadapo has joined DeSantis on the presidential campaign trail and held various events with the governor in which scientists and medical professionals with contrarian COVID-19 views have criticized federal health authorities' management of the pandemic.\nIn 2023, when he advised against young men getting the mRNA vaccines, a task force of University of Florida medical school doctors concluded he was \"cherry picking results,\" ignoring evidence that contradicted his bias and focusing on \"exceptionally small event rates that distort magnitude of risk and do not consider magnitude of benefit.\"\nAccording to a Health Department spokesman, Ladapo stood by his work."

      "text": "Herd immunity strategy endorsed by White House a 'ridiculous' way to stop COVID-19, scientists say \u2013 it will just kill people\nThe idea that the public can infect its way out of the COVID-19 pandemic is \"a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,\" 80 researchers said Wednesday in a letter published in the Lancet.\nThey strongly denounced the idea, advocated by the White House, of achieving \"herd immunity\" against the virus that causes the disease by letting healthy people with a low risk of serious illness get infected.\nA community is considered to have herd immunity when enough people build up protection against a pathogen, either through natural infection or a vaccine. For extremely contagious viruses such as the measles, about 90% of the population must be protected to prevent transmission.\nNo one knows exactly how many people need to be protected to stop COVID-19 from spreading, but estimates range from 50%-70% of the population.\nThere are more than 7.9 million cases and more than 217,000 deaths in the USA, according to Johns Hopkins data. Five states had a record number of deaths in a week, and 12 states set records for new cases in a week, a USA TODAY analysis found.\nA memorandum published Oct. 4, called the Great Barrington Declaration, called for the world to embrace herd immunity for COVID-19 as a way to protect the vulnerable while allowing economies to thrive.\nThe declaration came out of a meeting hosted by the libertarian-leaning American Institute for Economic Research. Its website says it has more than 9,000 signatures, though most names are not public.\n\u201cThe most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk,\" the declaration says.\nAccording to The New York Times, a senior administration official, speaking anonymously, said Monday that the president has long supported the idea. \"The plan is endorsing what the president's policy has been for months,\" he said.\nThe idea leaves most epidemiologists appalled and incredulous.\n\"It's just ridiculous,\" said Yvonne Maldonado, an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Stanford University Medical School. \"Everything they say (in the declaration) is either misinformation or an outright lie.\"\nThomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, denounced the declaration Wednesday, saying it was \"released without data or evidence.\"\nNot the way to end a pandemic\nHerd immunity can't work for several reasons, Maldonado said. First, no one knows how long someone who\u2019s had COVID-19 remains immune.\n\u201cWe know that the natural history of coronavirus infections is that people can get reinfected over and over again,\u201d she said. In one well-documented case, a 25-year-old man from Nevada was infected in late March and five weeks after recovering was diagnosed again with a slightly different version of the virus.\nThe idea that it\u2019s possible to isolate high-risk people is absurd, Maldonado said.\n\u201cOver 40% of the U.S. population has some risk. I don\u2019t know how you are going to keep 40% of the population away from the other 60%,\u201d she said.\nThough younger people are at \"minimal risk of death,\" as the declaration reads, it's by no means a zero chance.\nTrying to reach herd immunity would result in a much higher death rate than the USA is experiencing, which is why the concept is not being seriously discussed in scientific circles, said Dr. George Rutherford, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California-San Francisco.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is a disease in which you probably need to get somewhere in excess of 60% of people with permanent \u2013 not temporary \u2013 immunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not attainable without a much greater mortality than we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d\nAnthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a college class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that it\u2019s not clear what percent of the population would need to be infected to provide herd immunity from COVID-19, though it\u2019s likely to be 50% to 75% of the public.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not anywhere near there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf already, 200,000 people have died and you want to let things go to get herd immunity, you\u2019re going to get a lot of suffering and a lot of deaths. If we get herd immunity, let\u2019s get it with a vaccine and not by letting everybody get infected.\u201d\nThe USA accounts for about 4% of the world\u2019s population but has suffered 20% of the confirmed COVID-19 deaths. The disease leaves many survivors with long-term health effects that are not fully understood.\nEven heavily infected areas see increases\nBy definition, when herd immunity is reached, infections should decline. Even in the hardest hit areas of New York City, where one-quarter to one-third of residents may have been infected in the spring, infection rates are rising.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing you need to know that herd immunity has not been reached,\u201d said William Hanage, a Harvard epidemiologist.\nIn areas where the virus raged earlier in the year, lower rates of infection are the result not of herd immunity but changes in people's behavior, said Stephen Kissler, a research fellow in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\u201cIt is crystal clear that there are still enough susceptible people in the population even in major parts of New York City to sustain outbreaks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do see are vast differences in people\u2019s responses to the pandemic and the precautions people are taking.\u201d\nRates lowered because people in New York maintained social distance, wore masks and took other precautions, he said.\nThere's a better way\nCritics said that instead of pushing for herd immunity, the Trump administration should promote public health measures known to be safe and effective: wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding large groups, maintaining social distance and providing easily accessible testing and contact tracing.\nThe Lancet letter, called the \"John Snow Memorandum,\" notes countries that mounted a robust public health response to the virus, including Japan, Vietnam and New Zealand, effectively controlled transmission.\n\"We cannot afford distractions that undermine an effective response,\" said the 80 signatories, a who's who of the epidemiological, infectious disease and vaccinology world. They invited others to sign.\nJohn Snow, a Victorian physician, is considered the father of epidemiology. He tracked the source of a London cholera epidemic to a contaminated water well in 1854. He removed the pump handle, so no one could get water from the well \u2013 a controversial move at the time \u2013 and the epidemic ended.\nMonday, World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the idea of a society attempting to protect itself by herd immunity not just unscientific but also unacceptable.\n\"It\u2019s not a choice between letting the virus run free and shutting down our societies,\" he said.\nHerd immunity, Ghebreyesus said, is possible only through vaccination, which safely protects a large enough portion of the population to keep the virus from spreading. Letting the virus circulate unchecked would mean unnecessary infections, suffering and death.\nStopping COVID-19 doesn\u2019t require countries to shut down but to apply simple and inexpensive public health tools, he said.\n\u201cNever in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic,\u201d Ghebreyesus said. \u201cAllowing a dangerous virus that we don\u2019t fully understand to run free is simply unethical.\u201d\nContributing: Karen Weintraub\nContact Elizabeth Weise at eweise@usatoday.com.\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

      "text": "Florida DOH sends cease-and-desist order to WCJB TV20 over running of abortion ad\nThe Federal Communications Commission has criticized a cease-and-desist order sent by the Florida Department of Health to at least two television stations, including WCJB-TV20 in Gainesville, over the running of a political advertisement related to the state's abortion laws.\nThe letter, dated Oct. 3 and sent to TV20 General Manager Alan Chatman and Mike Jones, the vice president of political sales for Gray Media, the owner of the station, specifically attacks the ad's claim \"that current Florida law does not allow physicians to perform abortions necessary to preserve the lives and health of pregnant women.\"\nThe letter from the health department's general counsel, John Wilson, calls the ad \"false\" and \"dangerous.\" It says that women who see the ad may believe \"treatment is unavailable under Florida law ...\" and that women may travel out of state for care or not seek care at all.\n\"Such actions would threaten or impair the health and lives of these women,\" the letter says. It also threatens legal action if the station fail to comply.\nLoacl news: City of Newberry accused of attempting to censor resident over 'defamatory remarks'\nThe 30-second ad highlights a Tampa woman who became pregnant after a brain cancer diagnosis, and encourages voters in the Nov. 5 general election to vote \"yes\" on Amendment 4, which aims to limit government interference when it comes to abortion and reproductive rights.\n\u201cThe doctors knew that if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom. Florida has now banned abortions, even in cases like mine,\" the woman says in the ad, which was paid for by Floridians Protecting Freedom Inc.\nChatman, the station's general manager, declined to comment on the letter when reached by The Sun Wednesday afternoon.\nJessica Rosenworcel, the chair of the FCC, told CNN in a statement that stations should not be intimidated for airing political ads.\n\u201cThe right of broadcasters to speak freely is rooted in the First Amendment,\u201d Rosenworcel said in the statement. \u201cThreats against broadcast stations for airing content that conflicts with the government\u2019s views are dangerous and undermine the fundamental principle of free speech.\u201d\nThe Elias Law Group, which represents Floridians Protecting Freedom, sent a letter to Chatman and Jones urging them to continue to accept the advertisement.\nIt calls the letter from the Department of Health a \"flagrant abuse of power\" that \"must be rejected\"\n\"... it reflects an unconstitutional attempt to coerce the station into censoring protected speech,\" the letter says.\nIt also argues that the advertisement is true. The letter contends that Florida law would not allow for an abortion in the case of the woman in the ad because her condition was terminal. Therefore, an abortion would not have saved her life, only extended her life.\n\"... there is no genuine dispute as to the accuracy of the statements in this Advertisement,\" the letter says.\nAmendment 4, which would overturn the state's six-week abortion ban, will appear on the ballot in the upcoming Nov. 5 general election, and will ask voters to vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on the following ballot language:\n\"No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient\u2019s health, as determined by the patient\u2019s healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature\u2019s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.\""

      "text": "Despite FDA recommendations Florida Surgeon General Ladapo warns against new COVID booster\nThe summer COVID-19 surge continues, with nearly half the country reporting \"very high\" levels of COVID activity as measured by wastewater data, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe new COVID vaccine is now available at CVC and Walgreens and through clinics and healthcare providers. With the release of the vaccine, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is urging everyone to stay up to date... with information about how dangerous it is.\nIn a statement Thursday with the title, \"Updated Guidance for COVID-19 Boosters for the Fall and Winter 2024\u20132025 Season,\" the Florida Department of Health repeated the same arguments against mRNA COVID shots that Ladapo used when he recommended against their use in January, saying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not provide an adequate response to his questions regarding the drugs' safety.\n\"Based on the high rate of global immunity and currently available data, the State Surgeon General advises against the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,\" the FDOH statement said.\nThe FDA's response to Ladapo in December rebutted each of his concerns, warning that vaccine \"misinformation and disinformation\" would result in fewer people getting vaccinated, which contributes to the \"continued death and serious illness toll of COVID-19.\"\nCOVID-19 rates in Florida\nIn Florida, cases for August dropped from last year's numbers, with 62,038 reported cases this year compared to 91,941 in August 2023. Both numbers are almost certainly low as many people self-test at home and some may have it and never test at all.\nDeaths from COVID were on par with last year, however, with 828 last August compared to 877 in 2023. The average death total for the four months prior this year was 265.\nSo far 8.2 million Floridians have been infected with COVID-19 at least once, according to FDOH data, and 97,250 have died.\nLadapo says vaccine won't protect against new strains despite FDA assurances\nAlong with a list of seven bullet points of concerns over the effectiveness and health risks of mRNA vaccines and boosters \u2014 which experts say have been either debunked or fail to recognize the much higher threat of COVID infection for the same issues \u2014 the FDOH statement warned that \"this booster does not protect against the currently dominant strain, accounting for approximately 37% of infections in the United States\" and said that the vaccine was approved without specific trials in humans.\nThe FDA said in a release that the updated vaccines granted an emergency use authorization for distribution this fall were designed to target the KP.2 strain but also \"more closely target currently circulating variants and provide better protection against serious consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death.\"\nAs of the latest CDC's Nowcast data tracker, which displays COVID-19 estimates and projections for two-week periods, the Omicron KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 52.7% of positive infections between Sept. 1 and Sept. 14, followed by KP.2.3 at 12.2%, with LB.1 at 10.9% and KP.3 at 10.6%.\nAccording to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Yale Medicine, all say the new booster protects against the latest variants.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the potentially serious outcomes of COVID-19 for this fall and winter season.\nLadapo's history of COVID vaccine criticism\n- September 2021: Within a day of being hired, Ladapo signed new rules allowing parents to decide if children exposed to COVID could go to school anyway, eliminating the previous requirement for exposed students to quarantine off campus for at least four days.\n- October 2021: Ladapo appeared at DeSantis' side in public appearances, supporting the governor's views on blocking vaccine and mask mandates and accusing the public health community of fearmongering. Critics accused him of spreading misinformation that led to people being hesitant or afraid of vaccines. A firestorm of criticism erupted after Ladapo refused to wear a mask around Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky even after she told him she had a serious medical condition (later confirmed as breast cancer) and was at a higher risk for serious complications from COVID.\n- December 2021: The Florida Department of Health rejected a complaint about Ladapo that said he violated state medical laws by publicly casting doubts about COVID vaccines and promoting unproven treatments.\n- January 2022: At a press conference, DeSantis and Ladapo told Floridians who weren't showing symptoms not to get tested. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have symptoms, you are not a case,\" Ladapo said, in defiance of CDC and virologist recommendations.\n- June 2022: DeSantis and the FDOH, under Ladapo, refused to pre-order COVID-19 vaccines for children under five when they became available, the only U.S. state to do so, citing the lack of need and the risks. Ladapo appeared before Congress to defend the state's decision and said the state didn't recommend vaccines for children under 18.\n- October 2022: Ladapo urged men younger than 40 to avoid the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccine and booster shots because of the \"abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men in this age group,\" citing an anonymous non-peer-reviewed analysis from the FDOH. The move prompted a backlash from doctors, researchers and the federal government. At the time, Florida was leading the country in COVID deaths for the third month in a row.\n- January 2023: A task force of University of Florida medical school doctors concluded that the FDOH recommendation against COVID vaccines for young men was of \u201chighly questionable merit\" and that Ladapo cherry-picked data to support his stance. Politico went further and, after examining different drafts of the analysis, reported that Ladapo had personally changed the study to remove data that contradicted his views. Ladapo has denied this.\n- March 2023: In response to a letter from Ladapo demanding answers based on his own research on vaccine safety, the FDA and CDC asked him to stop disproportionally focusing on the small number of adverse effects in the studies of 13 billion COVID shots given around the world while ignoring the number of people the vaccines have saved.\n- April 2023: The FDOH under Ladapo stopped reporting COVID infections and deaths to the federal government\n- September 2023: Ladapo recommended against anyone under the age of 65 getting the new COVID-19 vaccine booster the FDA approved to combat new, more infectious variants, directly contradicting CDC guidance. He claimed that the mRNA boosters altered human DNA, which the CDC and multiple studies have said is false.\n- November 2023: After a two-year battle over COVID public records, the FDOH under Ladapo settled a lawsuit about withholding COVID data and released information spanning the entire duration of the pandemic on the state's FLHealthCHARTS.gov site. However, the agency also stopped providing cumulative totals, percentages, new case positivity, data on booster doses and overviews that made it easier to see trends.\n- January 2024: Ladapo made headlines again by \"calling for a halt to the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\" because he said he didn't receive an adequate response from the FDA about the safety of vaccines. Meanwhile, Florida was seeing a spike in new COVID cases and hospitalizations.\nContributing: Ahjan\u00e9 Forbes, USA TODAY"

      "text": "Weaponized surgeon general? Ladapo comes out swinging on social media, at DeSantis' side\nIf Florida\u2019s previous surgeon general's social media presence was muted, Dr. Joseph Ladapo has been equipped with a megaphone.\nLess than a month into the job, Ladapo has made a splash on Twitter and established himself as a regular presence by the Governor's side at news conferences, lending his medical pedigree to the governor's agenda.\nHe's been using his newly minted Twitter account \u2014 @FLSurgeonGen \u2014 to promote the public health policies of his boss, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. But he's also used it to go after Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a frequent critic of the governor and potential opponent of his in the 2022 governor's race.\nHis public presence also stands in direct contrast to that of his predecessor, Dr. Scott Rivkees, whose public appearances were curtailed after saying publicly in April 2020 that Floridians would need to stay masked until a COVID-19 vaccine was available.\nDr. Joseph Ladapo: What we know about Florida's Surgeon General\nRecently: Gov. Ron DeSantis calls for lawmakers to end COVID vaccine mandates in Florida\nHigher-paid: Joe Ladapo, Florida's new surgeon general, receives 52% raise over his predecessor\nHis presence was particularly notable at Thursday's rally in Clearwater where the governor called for a special session to protect workers from federal vaccine mandate and give parents more power to fight school districts demanding their kids wear masks.\nAnd despite his administration's insistence that DeSantis still supported vaccination, Ladapo blasted the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines.\nHe pushed for natural immunity and accused the overwhelming majority of the public health community of scientific dishonesty, as well as criticized the Biden administration's policies and the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"What we are talking about here today is really an example of just extreme policies that we've seen during this pandemic, and policies that have been implemented without thinking about whether they make sense or thinking about their risks and benefits and what the implications of those policies are,\" Ladapo said.\nComments like those and his unprecedented Twitter attacks on Fried, the governor's potential opponent in 2022 have effectively weaponized the surgeon general, said Ron Filipkowski, a Sarasota lawyer and former longtime Republican.\n\"This is right out of the Trump playbook,\" said Filipkowski, who quit the 12th Circuit Judicial Nominating Commission Desantis had appointed him to in protest over the firing and arrest of former Department of Health analyst Rebekah Jones.\nBackground: Armed Florida police raid the home of former state data scientist Rebekah Jones\nFilipkowski drew this comparison: Former President Donald Trump plucked Dr. Scott Atlas out of Stanford University to serve as his health advisor during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, after he sidelined Dr. Anthony Fauci.\nLadapo is DeSantis's Atlas, Filipkowski said.\nDeSantis intentionally picked someone aligned with his own views on COVID-19 and who was already politically active and outspoken. He found that person in Ladapo \u2014 a relatively young, untried research professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\u201cHe knew his views were contrary, that he was a political doctor prepared to go against the CDC,\u201d Filipkowski said.\nBut Ladapo's supporters said he is well qualified for the post, with a medical degree and a Ph.D from Harvard in 2008 and over 100 published scholarly articles. He spent time as a faculty member at NYU's School of Medicine, and was a staff fellow with the Food and Drug Administration 2012-14 under President Obama. He was hired at UCLA in 2016 and became a tenured professor in 2020.\n\"Dr. Ladapo is a critical and independent thinker. He does not take dogma at face value,\" Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a clinical professor of public health at the Kech School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, said in an email to the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.\nThe two have spent the last two years working together on policy activities related to COVID-19, Klausner said, and believes Ladapo to be open-minded, incorruptible, a fast learner who loves to read, and \"an ideal selection\" as Florida's surgeon general.\nTwitter attacks on Nikki Fried\nWhen Fried blasted the Department of Health after announcing last Thursday it would more than double the fees for Black farmers seeking medical marijuana licenses as discriminatory, Ladapo fired back on Twitter:\n\u201c @NikkiFriedFL is making ridiculous claims again. Did she mention she\u2019s a former marijuana lobbyist?\"\nAnd a week earlier, Ladapo criticized the methodology Fried's staff used in a study of COVID data trends in public schools:\n\"Hi @NikkiFriedFL! Correlation is not causation. Who on your team conducted this epidemiological study? The methods you used are weak.\nHe went on: \"Your team\u2019s analysis doesn\u2019t account for important factors beyond masks, such as testing frequency, community spread, etc. Did all these schools collect data in the same way, define cases in the same way, and mitigate spread the same way?\"\nThe politicization of public health\nBeing the state's top health officer and head of the Department of Health who serves at the pleasure of the governor has always had a political element to it, former health officials say. But Ladapo's partisan comments illustrate how polarized the public health debate over the COVID-19 pandemic has become on both a state and national level.\nAsked to comment on his comments, and whether Ladapo actually wrote them himself, DOH spokeswoman Weesam Khoury criticized the USA TODAY Network for focusing on his social media channel.\n\"First of all, it is unfortunate that public health has been so politicized, that you are hyperfocusing on the social media channel the Surgeon General uses to engage with Floridians on the important work of the Department,\" Khoury said, adding that he is \"directly involved in his social presence.\"\nSocial media platforms are a way for Florida officials to engage directly with the public \"and clarify misinformation \u2014 regardless of who perpetuates those narratives,\" she added.\nFlorida law says very little about the surgeon general's qualifications and responsibilities, other than that the person must be a licensed physician with \"extensive experience in public health administration.\"\nAs originally approved by the Legislature in 2007, the position served as \"the leading voice on wellness and disease-prevention efforts, including the promotion of healthful lifestyles, immunization practices, health literacy, and the assessment and promotion of the physician and health care workforce in order to meet the health care needs of the state.\"\nThat language was stripped from statutes during a 2012 reorganization, but as state health officer, Ladapo oversees a department responsible for all those things. And he's gone beyond merely being a supporter of DeSantis's own controversial policies that buck the mainstream consensus, according to Filipkowski.\n\u201cWhen I saw him using Nikki Fried\u2019s name, I asked myself, \u2018What is this?\u2019 He\u2019s not the governor\u2019s chief of staff. He was hired to give medical advice,\" Filipkowski said. \"How much time will he spend campaigning?\"\nHe expects Ladapo was chosen because of the prominent role COVID will play in the 2022 election: \"COVID is clearly the No. 1 issue in the governor\u2019s race and he\u2019s bringing in a political surgeon general.\"\n'Coronavirus does not care what your politics are'\nLadapo, who was simultaneously hired as an associate professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine, came to Florida \"with specific views on COVID-related safety measures, many of which were not in line with the vast majority of physicians,\" said Dr. Nina Shapiro, a professor at the UCLA School of Medicine.\n\"As I've said before, the coronavirus does not care what your politics are. You will get just as sick if Republican, Democrat, independent or other,\" Shapiro told the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida.\nPromoting those views will only serve to bolster people who believe mask mandates and vaccinations are unnecessary, she said.\nHaving someone in as high a position as Ladapo \"with such strong political views on minimizing the severity of this monstrous disease may be in the best interest of politicians, but is not in the best interest when it comes to the health of Florida's constituents,\" she said.\nLadapo's views were well known and well publicized long before his appointment as surgeon general. He had written more than a dozen pieces on the COVID-19 pandemic since the start of the pandemic. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, Ladapo penned a column for USA TODAY opposing shutdowns and other remedies being proposed at the time.\nFrom USA TODAY: Coronavirus pandemic: We were caught unprepared. It is too late for shutdowns to save us\nA widely viewed video from last summer shows Ladapo and other physicians standing on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court wearing lab coats and espousing hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID-19. YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter took down the video for promoting false and dubious claims about the pandemic after it had received more than 14 million views on Facebook alone.\nA group of experts determined the doctors for the most part were not actually directly in contact with people who had contracted the coronavirus.\nAnd he signed the Great Barrington Declaration, which promoted herd immunity and raised concerns about the prevailing COVID-19 policies.\nHe's argued that the potential risks of COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the benefits, especially among children and people who have recovered from the virus.\nHe's said vaccine mandates can't stop the spread of COVID-19, a point DeSantis has frequently made himself.\n'Individuals have every right to choose how to best protect themselves'\nOn his second day in office, Ladapo signed an emergency order reaffirming the governor's position on masks in schools, that it is strictly up to parents to decide if their children should wear them. The order also took away the authority of school districts to quarantine students exposed to COVID, leaving that decision also up to parents.\nHe also appeared alongside DeSantis promoting monoclonal antibody treatment in the early stages of COVID infection, and supporting DeSantis's decision to fine Leon County $3.57 million for its firing of 14 workers who refused to get vaccinated.\nMore: Leon County facing $3.57 million state fine for vaccine requirement\n\"Firing hard working employees over vaccine passports has lasting consequences & can impact the health of Floridians,\" Ladapo tweeted last week. \"Individuals have every right to choose how to best protect themselves & their families.\"\nLadapo's supporters at DOH and in the governor's office have said he is not anti-vaccine, as his detractors have suggested. But if there was any doubt about his position, he made himself clear Thursday when he stepped to the podium and unleashed a stream of anti-vaccine rhetoric.\n\"The idea that vaccine mandates are needed to create safe workplaces is a complete lie, and it's continued to be repeated and you should know that it's not at all backed up by science,\" Ladapo said. \"The science says the complete opposite, and that's a fact.\"\nPeople aren't comfortable getting vaccinated because there is a climate of scientific dishonesty about the science, Ladapo said, whether it is about the denial of natural immunity in the face of science or the safety of the vaccines.\nDr. Leo Nissola, a immunologist and immunotherapy scientist who also helped evaluate and design COVID-19 epidemiological models featured in White House press briefings, said it was \"absurd to see public leaders not following CDC guidelines and science.\"\nNissola said training is needed for public leaders like Ladapo \"who still do not understand the science.\"\nIt \"adds another layer of confusion and mistrust amongst the general population,\" he said.\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "'America's Frontline Doctors' may be real doctors, but experts say they don't know what they're talking about\nTech platforms scrambled this week to delete a video featuring seven doctors who claimed their front-line knowledge of the pandemic contradicts the guidance of public health experts \u2013 even as President Donald Trump, his son and other political allies sought to amplify the video.\nThe event suggested the doctors' personal experience gave them a valuable perspective on the public health crisis that they said was not being taken seriously.\nAnd the major theme throughout the event by the group that calls itself America\u2019s Frontline Doctors: touting the alleged benefits of hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID-19 and shooting down the science that has shown it does not have a clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients and even has increased risks.\n\"These are the doctors diagnosing, treating and helping patients beat COVID-19,\" said Jenny Beth Martin \u2013 co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, a pro-Trump conservative group that helped organize the event \u2013 during the news conference.\nWhile their name, America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, suggests the speakers may work in hospital emergency rooms or intensive care units and have experience treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, it's unclear to what extent the doctors have such experience.\nUSA TODAY confirmed that most are physicians with active state medical licenses, but their specialties and experience suggests they were offering little more than personal opinions rather than research experience on infectious diseases.\nWhile one is affiliated with a hospital that would treat critically ill patients and others work at urgent care or other clinics, none claim to be infectious disease experts or doctors working in a hospital emergency room or intensive care unit.\nMany have also been vocal critics of lockdowns and supporters of the Trump administration.\nAshish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, likened the views expressed in the video to his own opinions about foreign politics in an interview with USA TODAY on Wednesday.\nJha acknowledged the power of the image contained in the video: a group of doctors standing outside the Supreme Court, donning white lab coats, boasting an introduction from a U.S. congressman and spreading a hopeful message amid a raging pandemic. It proved a convincing package to the more the 17 million people who viewed one version of the video circulating online before it was taken down earlier this week.\nSpeaking with MSNBC, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, called the group \"a bunch of people spouting something that isn't true.\"\nDr. Joe Ladapo, a UCLA physician who appeared in the video, told USA TODAY in an email that he appeared at the event \"because I believe it\u2019s critically important for us to have a discussion that includes different perspectives about our approach to COVID-19.\"\nJha, however, said the idea that any doctor's personal experience could outweigh more rigorous studies is simply unscientific.\n\u201cExperiences are trumped by scientific evidence,\u201d he said. And in the case of the arguments made in the video, Jha says the evidence doesn't back up their experiences.\nSome of the allegations made in the video \u2013 including that a cure for COVID-19 exists \u2013 essentially suggest a global conspiracy to suppress an effective treatment to the coronavirus, Jha said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not science.\"\nWho was featured in the video?\nUSA TODAY tried to contact all of the doctors who spoke during the controversial video filmed Monday to verify the organization's claim that they are working on the front lines of the pandemic. One responded, another declined to comment and the rest did not answer. USA TODAY also reached out to Tea Party Patriots, the group organizing the event, and did not immediately get a response.\nMany of the speakers have made public statements that clash with the opinion of the majority of public health experts.\n- Dr. Simone Gold, who has identified herself as an emergency medicine specialist in Los Angeles. In May, she gained national attention for being a part of a group of Pro-Trump doctors who advocated for quickly reopening the economy. On her website, she claims she \"works as an emergency physician on the frontlines whether or not there is a pandemic.\" On LinkedIn, she says she works as a \"Concierge Physician,\" an increasingly common field of medicine where patients pay a monthly or annual fee for access to a physician, according to AARP. She is listed as having a renewed and current medical license by the Medical Board of California and self-reported to the board that she completes 30-39 hours of patient care per week.\n- Dr. Bob Hamilton identified himself as a pediatrician from Santa Monica, California, with 36 years of practice. He's listed as a pediatrician at Pacific Ocean Pediatrics, which reports on its website he has privileges at two California hospitals. He is listed as having a renewed and current medical license by the Medical Board of California.\n- Dr. Stella Immanuel identified herself as a primary care physician in Houston and claims to have successfully treated about 350 COVID-19 patients. She has a full medical license in Texas, according to Texas Medical Board online records. She told the board she has a primary specialty of pediatrics and a secondary specialty of emergency medicine.\n- Dr. Dan Erickson was featured in a previous controversial video criticizing lockdowns; he co-owns California urgent care centers. The American Academy of Emergency Medicine condemned Erickson for his \"reckless and untested musings\" relating to COVID-19 in April. Erickson is listed as having a license from the Osteopathic Medical Board of California. While the training for a doctor of osteopathic medicine is slightly different, focusing on more of a hands-on and holistic approach to health, they must go through a similar licensing process as physicians, according to the Mayo Clinic. His urgent care center, Accelerated Urgent Care, does have a current license with the state medical board.\n- Dr. Richard G. Urso is listed as an ophthalmologist with Houston Eye Associates. He has a full medical license in Texas, according to Texas Medical Board online records. He told the board he has a primary and secondary specialty of ophthalmology. An assistant for Urso declined to comment to USA TODAY.\n- Dr. James Todaro identifies himself on LinkedIn as a Detroit-area physician, managing partner of an investment fund and former physician with an eye group. Michigan's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs does not list anyone with a current medical doctor license by Todaro's name.\n- Dr. Joe Ladapo is an associate professor of medicine in the division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He is listed as a Hospitalist affiliated with Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center by UCLA health. Ladapo wrote in an email to USA TODAY that he has treated COVID-19 patients but that his primary work is in clinical research. He said that his research has not primarily focused on COVID-19 and potential treatments, but rather policy and management of the pandemic. Ladapo has written numerous opinion editorials critical of lockdowns published by national outlets, including USA TODAY.\nA doctor who believes in demon sperm sued for medical malpractice\nImmanuel has received heightened attention among the doctors in the group after a report from the Daily Beast highlighted some of her bizarre religious and medical beliefs.\nThe Daily Beast reported that Immanuel has stated \"that gynecological problems like cysts and endometriosis are in fact caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches\" and that \"alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments.\"\nOn Twitter, Immanuel embraced these claims, tweeting, \"Yes America! some need deliverance from demon sperm\" and said the news outlet \"did a great job summarizing our deliverance ministry.\"\nThe address listed for Immanuel's practice is at the same strip mall where her Fire Power Ministries Christian Resource Center is located.\nAt the event for America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, Immanuel also said masks are not necessary, despite evidence that has shown the use of face coverings can slow the spread of the virus through respiratory droplets.\nIn a video posted on Facebook in April, Immanuel is seen wearing full-body personal protective equipment in which she says her clinic offers screening for COVID-19 in its parking lot.\nAccording to online records, the Texas Medical Board lists no investigations into medical malpractice against Immanuel; however, the Houston Chronicle reported that Immanuel was the subject of a medical malpractice lawsuit tied to a woman's death in Louisiana, where Immanuel is also licensed to practice.\nAccording to the Chronicle, the lawsuit says that a woman treated by Immanuel complained about a needle in her arm. Immanuel prescribed medication but did not perform a closer examination or tests, the lawsuit says, per the Chronicle.\nThe woman sought help hours later from a hospital because of the pain. A surgeon removed the needle, but days later, the woman died, the lawsuit says. Dick Knadler, an attorney for the woman's mother, told the Houston Chronicle that the woman died from an infection.\nImmanuel could not be reached for comment by USA TODAY or the Houston Chronicle.\nWho organized the the white lab coat 'press conference'?\nThe group Tea Party Patriots hosted the event, which also featured Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. On its website, Tea Party Patriots published several other videos of the same doctors speaking at a summit, billed as part of the \"Second Opinion Project.\"\n\"American life has fallen casualty to a massive disinformation campaign. We can speculate on how this has happened, and why it has continued, but the purpose of the American Frontline Doctor's Summit is to empower Americans to stop living in fear,\" Tea Party Patriots writes on its website.\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political fundraising, the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, a super PAC, has raised more than $24 million since 2014 for Republican candidates and conservative causes.\nThe group also operates a 501(c)3 non-profit and a 501(c)4 social welfare organization, which allows it to participate in politics and influencing legislation.\nOn the group's website, its super PAC pushes for Trump's reelection as well as keeping Republicans in office.\nMartin, the group's co-founder who was also featured prominently in the video, has led the group and grown it \"to be the largest and most effective national umbrella group within the Tea Party movement,\" the group's website states.\n\"Jenny Beth Martin and Tea Party Patriots now use their network to reach millions of Americans every week with education and updates about fiscal responsibility, free market principles, and constitutionally limited government,\" the website says.\nWhat we know about COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine\nFauci and other leading voices in public health and infectious disease research have repeatedly said that the cumulative knowledge of scientific evidence to date does not show that hydroxychloroquine has a positive effect for COVID-19 patients and that there are risk in taking the drug for COVID-19 patients.\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has revoked its emergency authorization for the use of the drug in treating the new coronavirus.\nThe agency said in a letter the decision is based on new evidence that made it unreasonable to believe hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine \"may be effective in diagnosing, treating or preventing\" COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\nCiting reports of heart complications, the FDA said the drugs pose a greater risk to patients than any potential benefits.\nThe drug came to public attention after several small, anecdotal, non-peer-reviewed reports about hydroxychloroquine in China in February. None was up to the scientific gold standard of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that would more definitively show whether the drug worked.\nAn analysis by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Network, found that many hydroxychloroquine trials have resembled lone-wolf research, overseen by individual hospitals and universities and have become became a frenzied hodge-podge of undertakings \u2013 an unprecedented scientific free-for-all in which research overlapped, studies were poorly designed, and patients were given drugs of unproven benefit.\nContributing: Adrianna Rodriguez, John Fauber and The Associated Press"

Despite the recent lull in tropical activity, we're close to the peak of hurricane season and forecasters have been warning activity is expected to increase.\n\u27a4 What does history tell us about Florida and September hurricanes? Will you be surprised?\nIn the eastern Pacific, forecasters are watching two hurricanes: Kiko and Lorena.\nLorena could bring heavy rain from southeastern California to Texas.\nKiko, which could reach Category 5 strength later this week, could bring heavy rain, strong winds and dangerous surf to Hawaii by the middle of next week, depending on its track and intensity, according to AccuWeather.\nHere's the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center as of 2 p.m., Thursday, Sept. 4.\nNational Hurricane Center tracking Invest 91L. Will it become Tropical Storm Gabrielle?\nA broad area of low pressure now designated as Invest 91L has formed along a tropical wave over the eastern tropical Atlantic.\nRecent satellite imagery suggests the system continues to slowly become better organized with shower and thunderstorm activity along its eastern periphery.\nEnvironmental conditions are favorable for additional development of the system and a tropical depression is likely to form by this weekend as it moves slowly westward at 5 to 10 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.\nResidents in the Lesser Antilles and Leeward Islands should monitor the progress of this system as it approachesfrom the east by the middle of next week.\n- Formation chance through 48 hours: medium, 60 percent.\n- Formation chance through 7 days: high, 90 percent.\nSpaghetti models for Invest 91L\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\nWhat other tropical waves, disturbances are in Atlantic basin?\nTropical wave 1: An eastern Caribbean tropical wave is along 62W south of 21N, and moving westward at 11 to 17 mph. Scattered moderate convection is active from 12N to 14N between 62W and 64W.\nWhat is an invest?\nShort for investigation, the National Hurricane Center uses the term invest for areas of low pressure it is monitoring for potential development into a tropical depression or storm.\nInvests are not tropical depressions or tropical storms. They're usually clusters of showers and thunderstorms, and just because they've been designated as an invest does not guarantee they'll strengthen into a tropical storm or hurricane.\nInvests run from 90 to 99, followed by a letter: L for the Atlantic basin and E for those in the eastern Pacific. After 99, it starts over again and the next invest would be 90.\nOnce something has been designated as an invest, specialized data sets and computer models can begin, including scheduling Hurricane Hunter aircraft missions and running spaghetti models.\nAre there any hurricanes coming to Florida?\nIt's still too early to tell where Invest 91L in the eastern Atlantic will go.\n\u27a4 September hurricane season forecast: Savor the break, but trouble is brewing in back half\n\"As usual, the most likely eventual outcome is a path well east of the U.S. East Coast, but there\u2019s enough uncertainty in where the storm will be and what the steering current pattern will be like beyond next week to make the situation worth lightly monitoring for U.S. interests,\" said Dr. Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger, who works with the USA TODAY Network.\nAccuWeather Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said the most likely days for strengthening would be between Sept. 5-6.\n\"Due to large amounts of dry air currently in the region, any tropical development and strengthening would likely be gradual. But, it's possible that anything that forms could ramp up to a hurricane by the end of the weekend,\" DaSilva said.\nWhen is tropical activity expected to increase?\n\"While there will be a relative lull in tropical activity during the first few days of September, atmospheric conditions will become a lot more conducive for development later this week and into next week,\" said DaSilva.\nMore tropical waves are expected to move off the coast of Africa. With less dust and dry air in the way, it's likely more of these waves will strengthen, according to AccuWeather.\nColorado State University predicting tropics to become more active\nIn its two-week forecast for Sept. 3-16, Colorado State University forecasters are predicting activity will pick up over the next couple of weeks.\n\"Global model ensembles are pretty aggressive with additional tropical cyclone development in days 8 through 14, with potential formations in the eastern Atlantic as well as in the western Caribbean/southern Gulf,\" the CSU forecast said.\n\"The primary threat formation area for major hurricanes in early- to mid-September is in the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.\"\nWarm water means tropical development so watch Gulf closely\nThe Gulf will bear watching, AccuWeather forecasters warned.\n\"With very warm waters, the Gulf could fuel the rapid strengthening of any tropical system that develops or moves into the region.\"\nWhat do the colored, hatched areas on the NOAA map mean?\nThe hatched areas on the National Hurricane Center's tropical outlook map indicate \"areas where a tropical cyclone \u2014 which could be a tropical depression, tropical storm or hurricane \u2014 could develop,\" said National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Jamie Rhome.\nThe colors make it visibly clear how likely a system could develop, with yellow being low, orange medium, and red high.\nThe National Hurricane Center generally doesn't issue tropical advisories until there is a named storm, but there is an exception.\n\"If a system is near land and there is potential for development, the National Hurricane Center won't wait before it issues advisories, even if the system hasn't become an actual storm. This gives residents time to prepare,\" Rhome said.\nWho is likely to be impacted by Invest 91L, tropical wave?\nIt's too early at this time to determine if there will be any impact to Florida or the U.S. from Invest 91L or the tropical wave in the Atlantic basin.\nForecasters urge all residents to keep an eye on the tropics and to always be prepared.\nNeed hurricane supplies? Those items are tax free all year\nOfficials regularly encourage Florida residents to prepare for storms before a hurricane is approaching, while shelves are fully stocked and you aren't battling crowds all rushing to the store at the same time.\n\u27a4 Don't have a hurricane supply kit? From the basics to the extras, here's what you need\n\"It only takes one storm to make it an impactful year for your community,\" the National Hurricane Center Miami posted on X. \"Hurricane season is a marathon, not a sprint.\"\n\u27a4 See list of emergency supplies you can now buy tax free\nOn Aug. 1, specific hurricane supplies became permanently tax-free in Florida, ranging from batteries to generators.\nFlorida weather radar for Sept. 4, 2025\nWeather watches and warnings issued in Florida\nWhen is the Atlantic hurricane season?\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.\nNinety-seven percent of tropical cyclone activity occurs during this time period, NOAA said.\nThe Atlantic basin includes the northern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of America, as the Gulf of Mexico is now known in the U.S. per an order from President Trump.

      "text": "September 05, 2024\nInfant mortality rates have plummeted over the last 50 years. Globally, they\u2019ve fallen by over two-thirds, from around 10% in 1974 to less than 3% today.\nA recent study \u2014 published in The Lancet by Andrew Shattock and an international team of researchers \u2014 estimates that increased access to crucial vaccines means that infant mortality rates are 40% lower than they would be in a world without vaccines.\nThe chart shows the actual reduction in infant mortality rates with vaccination (in blue) and the researchers\u2019 estimates for a hypothetical scenario in which vaccines wouldn\u2019t have been rolled out (in red).\nBased on these figures, vaccines are estimated to have saved 150 million children over the last 50 years. Vaccinations accounted for 40% of that decline.\nRead our article on the role of vaccination in reducing infant mortality \u2192\nRelated topic pages:\nYesterday\nThe Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS) has published weekly data on the area burned by wildfires since 2012. At the beginning of August, Spain was on track for a relatively low year. Its running total for 2025 was below the average and far below former records.\nBut just two weeks later, it had overtaken all of these previous years. You can see this in the chart, which shows the cumulative wildfire burn across each year. Large outbreaks in mid-August meant the last record, set in 2022, was rapidly surpassed.\nThis global dataset from GWIS only dates back to 2012, so it is a relatively short record. However, the European Forest Fire Information System, based on data starting in 2006, also found that this year\u2019s fires were the highest in two decades in Spain.\nPortugal has also seen extremely large fires this year.\nNote that consistent data is unavailable over longer periods, so it\u2019s hard to give context to the scale of these fires compared to the more distant past.\nSee how large wildfires in your country have been compared to previous years \u2192\nSeptember 01\nA decade ago, solar power was almost non-existent in Hungary. It generated just 0.2% of the country\u2019s electricity. Nuclear, coal, and gas dominated the grid.\nBut in the last ten years, things have changed a lot. You can see this in the chart: solar power has boomed, and now supplies one-quarter of Hungary\u2019s electrical power. In 2024, it overtook gas to become the second-largest source of electricity, after nuclear.\nCoal power has been largely displaced, first by gas and now by solar. This has helped cut the country\u2019s CO2 emissions by 45% since 1990.\nExplore how the electricity mix is changing in your country \u2192\nAugust 29\nMany of us take artificial light for granted. Most of us use it daily: we can read, cook, and do tasks indoors; students can study at night; and our communities and homes are safer when not cloaked in darkness.\nIt\u2019s not just light that has been transformative, but cheap light. The price of lighting has fallen by more than 99.9% since the 1700s.\nChanges in what we use to power lighting have been crucial to the plummeting costs. This chart, based on data from Fouquet and Pearson, shows these changes from 1700 to 2000.\nIn 1700, the typical British household lit its evenings with candles. In the 18th century, they started using whale oil, and by the 19th century, they saw the rise of burning gas. Kerosene briefly provided a fifth of light around 1900. With each transition, lighting became more efficient, and the costs dropped. But the defining transition has been to electricity. It now provides almost all of the UK\u2019s artificial light.\nFor hundreds of millions of the world\u2019s poorest, lighting at night is still a luxury, and will remain so until they get access to electricity.\nExplore what the cost and distribution of lighting tell us about human development \u2192\nAugust 27\nFor most of the 2010s, Ecuador had some of the lowest murder rates in Latin America. According to data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, rates were often three or four times lower than the regional average.\nBut as you can see in the chart, homicide rates have risen steeply in the last few years. From 2020 to 2023, rates increased more than fivefold. To put this in context: the number of people murdered each year increased from roughly 1,400 to 8,200.\nEcuador went from being one of the safest countries in the region to having one of the highest murder rates, not only in Latin America, but in the world as a whole.\nThis increase in violence has been linked to Ecuador\u2019s growing role in international drug trafficking and competition between criminal groups. Large outbreaks of prison violence, often involving rival gangs, have also contributed.\nEstimates of homicide rates can vary between sources; read our explainer on differences between them \u2192\nAugust 25\nGo back to China in the 1960s, and you\u2019ll find that the average person ate very little meat. This isn\u2019t surprising: most of the country lived in extreme poverty and could not afford it. Meat consumption is strongly correlated with income: as countries get richer, they tend to have more diverse, meat-heavy diets.\nHowever, as the chart shows, meat supply per person has increased significantly over the last sixty years. In 1962, annual consumption was just 4 kilograms per person. By 2022, it had increased almost 18-fold to 70 kilograms.\nIt\u2019s not only the amount of meat consumed that\u2019s changed: people in China also eat a more diverse mix. In the 1960s and 1980s, almost all meat came from pork. Today, pork still dominates, but it is joined by more poultry and beef.\nThis change in diet matters for various reasons. More diversified diets (which are not only about animal products) tend to be more nutritious than monotonous staple-heavy diets that are common for people living in poverty. But this increase in meat consumption also comes with a large environmental impact and consequences for animal welfare.\nExplore how meat consumption has changed in your own country \u2192\nAugust 22\nScientists can make an enormous difference in the world.\nTake the researcher Sarah Gilbert, who has dedicated her career to developing vaccines. Over the last two decades, she has contributed to vaccines against the flu, MERS, Nipah virus, and Rift Valley fever. When she heard about the outbreak in China in January 2020, she began working on a vaccine, just in case. By the end of that year, the vaccine against COVID-19 was approved, saving an estimated 6.3 million lives in the following year alone. Without this effort, we would have faced a much darker reality, marked by lockdowns, overwhelmed health systems, and widespread suffering.\nThis chart lists many such scientists whose work saved many people\u2019s lives. The estimates are taken from the web publication Science Heroes, where you can find profiles of these scientists.\nIt\u2019s difficult to estimate the exact difference particular innovations have made, and I take all such estimates with a grain of salt. None of these scientists did their work in isolation; their innovations were achieved thanks to collaborative efforts and the earlier work of other researchers.\nOur team spends much of its time counting deaths, but it\u2019s equally important to know the number of lives saved \u2014 even though it is harder to estimate and involves much larger uncertainty. It\u2019s inspiring to be reminded that creative, enterprising, and tenacious people can enormously contribute to our lives.\nFritz Haber and Carl Bosch, who invented synthetic fertilizers, are at the top of this list. My colleague Hannah Ritchie wrote an article about the difference their work has made: How many people does synthetic fertilizer feed? \u2192\nAugust 20\nAccording to official mining output records, Peru mined about 90 tonnes of gold in 2023, far ahead of any other South American country. That puts it within the world\u2019s top 15 producers, just below the 10th place, as shown in the chart.\nHowever, this official figure captures only part of Peru\u2019s gold economy. Customs export data shows a striking discrepancy: about 80 tonnes of unaccounted gold in 2023, according to the Peruvian Institute of Economics. That\u2019s gold whose value appears in export statistics but not mine-output records \u2014 and it is almost as large as the official figure based on mine records.\nSome of this gap may be due to re-exports, inventories, or recycled gold. But given how big the discrepancy is, Peru\u2019s authorities, researchers, and media see it as a practical indicator of the scale of informal and illegal mining. An article in The Economist, for example, compares Peru with other countries using this approach, and argues that gold has become more profitable than drugs for many gangs in South America.\nIllegal gold mining is widely recognized as a major issue in Peru and the region, frequently linked to environmental damage and organized crime. This context matters today: the steep recent increase in gold prices raises incentives around unregulated extraction and trade.\n\u2192 Our Minerals Data Explorer has more data on metals, minerals, and mining.

      "text": "'Grave concerns': Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo's medical license OK'd in two days\nThe process normally can take 2-6 months, experts say\nDr. Joseph Ladapo, the unorthodox surgeon general of Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose employment at the University of Florida was fast-tracked with the help of a powerful donor, also got his new Florida medical license application approved in record time.\nRecords show it only took the Florida Board of Medicine two days to approve Ladapo\u2019s 10-page online application \u2014 a process that can take 2-6 months, according to the board\u2019s own website and confirmed by medical and legal professionals familiar with the process. All 15 members of the Board of Medicine are appointed by the governor.\n\u201cAs a physician, this revelation raises further grave concerns about Dr. Ladapo,\u201d said Dr. Mona Mangat, a St. Petersburg allergist and immunologist in an email to the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida. \u201cFast-tracking of his medical license and placement in the University of Florida as a professor additionally undermines our trust in this man.\u201d\nMore coverage of the surgeon general from the USA TODAY Network-Florida:\n- Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show\n- DeSantis mega-donor, UF Board of Trustees chair supplied Ladapo's resume, fast-tracking surgeon general's hire\n- How much does Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo make? Compare other state workers here\n- Fact checking Florida Surgeon General Ladapo: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\n- Weaponized surgeon general? Ladapo comes out swinging on social media, at DeSantis' side\n- Florida Surgeon General Ladapo says he can't 'communicate effectively' in his refusal to wear mask in Polsky's office\nThe UF College of Medicine\u2019s top administrators helped Ladapo through the application process in two weeks\u2019 time after getting word that he had the backing of Board of Trustees Chairman Mori Hosseini, a GOP megadonor and adviser to Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nFaculty have complained that the rushed process also sidestepped the normal process for approving tenure.\nLadapo submitted his medical school license Sept. 8, records show, just days after Hosseini forwarded his resume to Dr. David Nelson, senior vice president of health affairs for the University of Florida and president of UF Health.\nMangat, a board member of the national advocacy group Committee to Protect Health Care, was among the 350 Florida physicians who signed and submitted a letter to the Florida Senate asking for a rigorous vetting of Ladapo when its regular session begins Jan. 11.\nMany of Ladapo's views against mask and vaccine mandates are in line with DeSantis, who has made challenging such policies a linchpin of his re-election campaign. Among the doctors' chief concerns is Ladapo casting doubt about the efficacy of masks to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the safety and efficacy of vaccines.\n\u201cWe urge you to exercise your authority to ask questions of this nominee, given your role in confirming them, to clarify Dr. Ladapo\u2019s commitment to the health and safety of all Floridians during the pandemic,\u201d the letter said.\n'Politics-over-public-health approach'\nAmong other things, they said, the Senate should ask about Ladapo\u2019s association with America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, a fringe group that has made millions peddling treatments that have been proven to be ineffective against COVID-19. They also question his scientific basis for opposing universal masking in schools and for promoting natural immunity and unproven treatments for COVID-19, including hydroxychloroqhine and ivermectin.\n\u201cI imagine Dr. Ladapo's association with the fringe group 'America's Frontline Doctors' \u2026 and his past incorrect comments about COVID-19 vaccines and masks should disqualify him from a medical license, let alone becoming surgeon general,\u201d Mangat said.\nFrom USA TODAY: 'America's Frontline Doctors' may be real doctors, but experts say they don't know what they're talking about\n\u201cUnfortunately though, it seems these dangerous, quacky views are the precise ones Gov. DeSantis was looking for in a surgeon general, to support his politics-over-public-health approach to the pandemic.\u201d\nDeSantis has steadfastly stood by his choice of Ladapo as surgeon general, saying he is well qualified for the position.\n\"Contrary to Dr. Mangat\u2019s assertions, nothing that Dr. Ladapo has said about vaccines or masks has been demonstrably 'false.' The state surgeon general has been clear about his approach to public health and policymaking: He follows the data and considers the broad impact of health policies on Floridians\u2019 overall well-being,\" Christina Pushaw, the governor's press secretary, said in an email.\nPushaw referred questions about the license application to the Department of Health, which did not respond.\nPhone calls and emails to the Florida Board of Medicine's executive director and legal counsel, asking to explain how Ladapo\u2019s application was approved so quickly, also were unanswered.\nHours after this story published online, a Department of Health spokesperson provided a statement, saying that during the COVID pandemic, applications submitted for critical need professions have been expedited. Applications must be reviewed within 30 days of submittal and the current average number of days for processing a medical doctor application is one to three days.\n\"When a completed application is sent to the Board office with no issues or missing information, Board staff can approve the application and the physician can begin working in Florida,\" Weesam Khoury, communications director for the Department of Health, said. \"The application is then ratified by the full Board of Medicine at their next meeting.\"\nIn addition, Khoury said, \"Since when is fast processing times for heroes and medical professional a bad thing?\"\nLadapo's application was provided in response to a public records request by the USA TODAY Network-Florida. A follow-up email asking if other documents proving his credentials \u2014 his medical school transcripts, post-graduate internship records, for example \u2014 were included in the application packet was not answered.\nSuch documentation is recommended to help expedite the application process and background check.\n\"Licenses will not be issued without the background check results and will be issued in date order,\" the website says.\nSpeed of medical license application approval unheard of, experts say\nOther medical license and medical recruiters agreed that it\u2019s unusual to have a license approved so quickly. And while it is not uncommon to be hired for an academic position without being licensed, typically doctors wait until they have a license before they begin applying for work.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard of a full license being issued in two days \u2014 ever,\u201d said Amy Weber, owner of US Health Care Licensing in Orange Jacksonville.\nIf he had planned ahead and gotten his licenses from other states, medical school transcripts, examination board scores, residency certificates, and other documentation verified in advance, she said \u201cit\u2019s possible he could have gotten the license approved in a relatively short period of time.\u201d\nBut in the 13 years she\u2019s been assisting major hospitals around the country, such as Harvard University Hospital and the Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, with navigating doctors through the licensing process, she\u2019s \u201cnever seen a doctor with all their ducks in a row.\u201d\nEven then he would have needed a month or two of advanced planning, which would mean he knew that far ahead that he was in line for surgeon general. In fact, Ladapo\u2019s physician profile on the Florida Board of Medicine website says that information in it has not been verified.\nAlso, his profile doesn\u2019t provide mandatory information in several categories \u2014 an indication of a rushed job, one expert said.\nLadapo is a 2008 graduate of Harvard Medical School, with a certification in internal medicine, according to his resume. He's written dozens of op-ed pieces critical of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's protocols for combating the pandemic.\nFive years ago Ladapo was an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Population Health and Medicine, New York University School of Medicine before getting hired as an associate professor at the University of California Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine, where he attained tenure in 2020.\nWhile the profile says he attended Harvard Medical School 2000-08, it doesn\u2019t actually list his medical degree or his Ph.D. in health policy.\nThe profile doesn\u2019t list his graduate medical education or post-graduate training, including his internship and residency at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Mass., from 2008 to 2011.\nThe Florida Board of Medicine\u2019s website says it's required by law to review applications within 30 days, and that it generally takes 3-5 days just to review applications for a medical doctor license, and up to 10 business days before the information on their status is updated.\nAnd the board has a strict policy of fairness, the website says.\n\u201cOne application is not accelerated at the expense of another, particularly if there is a premature commitment to start practicing medicine,\u201d the board\u2019s website says, not once but twice. \u201c All applicants are handled equally and fairly. The application process may take between two to six months to complete depending on your credentials.\u201d\nThe website also says: \u201cYou will not be able to start work until you have been granted a full medical license.\u201d\nIt also warns not to \"make any commitments based upon expectation of licensure until you are actually licensed. Some applicants suffer significant costs by signing mortgages and committing to a start date prematurely.\"\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "DeSantis mega-donor, UF Board of Trustees chair supplied Ladapo's resume, fast-tracking surgeon general's hire\nUniversity of Florida Board of Trustees Chair Mori Hosseini, a millionaire developer, GOP megadonor and adviser to Gov. Ron DeSantis, sent current Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo's resume to the president of UF Health, newly disclosed emails reveal.\nDr. David Nelson in turn forwarded the Sept. 1 email with Ladapo's resume attached to the dean of the College of Medicine and the associate vice president for research affairs, kicking off a fast-track hiring process for Ladapo to coincide with the governor\u2019s announcement that he was appointing the UCLA professor as his new surgeon general.\n\u201cThis faculty is interested in coming to join the UF family. Google search him and see if you can guess the story. Will fill you in later but please keep confidential,\u201d Nelson told his deans in a Sept. 2 email, hinting that Ladapo, a UCLA professor with controversial views on COVID-19, was the governor's choice for surgeon general.\n\"He looks fabulous \u2014 let me know what I can do to be supportive!\" UF College of Medicine Dean Colleen Koch replied.\nLadapo is a divisive choice because his publicly held opinions on COVID-19 policies on masks and vaccines, while aligned with DeSantis, run counter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and mainstream public health officials.\nSince he assumed the surgeon general's role, Ladapo has been mired in controversy. His first official act was to issue an emergency rule banning schools from quarantining students exposed to COVID-19, leaving the decision to parents.\nAnd he's attracted national attention for refusing to don a mask at the request of State Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, at her office at the Florida Capitol.\nWhat does Ladapo do?: Florida's surgeon general: What does the surgeon general actually do?\nFinding the facts: Fact checking Florida Surgeon General Ladapo: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\nLadapo on meeting with Polsky: Under fire, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo says he can't communicate clearly while masked\nLadapo's refusal drew criticism from Senate President Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, who will oversee his confirmation process.\nDeSantis's press secretary Christina Pushaw said the governor stands by his choice.\n\"Criticism from the media, activist groups, and politicians is an expected part of the job for any public figure,\" Pushaw said. \"This is especially true for a leader like Governor DeSantis, who is unafraid to challenge establishment narratives.\"\nEmail from Mori Hosseini shows his role in hiring\nThe emails, requested by the Gainesville Sun and USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida, were received Thursday, after a report was published detailing how Ladapo's recruitment and hiring was fast-tracked to coincide with his appointment.\nEmails show how Ladapo was hired: Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show\nThe email from Hosseini, with a simple FYI in the message field, reveals his until now unreported role behind the scenes as a go-between for the governor, who has relied on Hosseini as a campaign adviser.\nDeSantis received $105,000 in campaign contributions from development companies owned by Hosseini. He also lent his private jet to the first lady in 2019 to fly from Tallahassee to Jacksonville to attend a fundraiser by a defense contractor, who also is a supporter of DeSantis, as first reported by Politico.\nDeSantis reappointed Hosseini as chair of the UF board of trustees in February.\nHosseini did not return phone calls seeking comment.\nEmail: 'Future State of FL surgeon general'\nIn a subsequent email, Nelson told Koch and other administrators that UF Health was interested in recruiting Ladapo, a potential candidate for surgeon general to replace Dr. Scott Rivkees, also a UF Health professor who had been surgeon general for the previous two years and three months.\n\"There are some sensitivities regarding timing and would ask if you could expedite this communication,\" Nelson said in a Sept. 3 email, adding that \"Joe, Kent, and Mori are all aware and very supportive,\" referring to Provost Joe Glover, President Kent Fuchs and Hosseini.\nGlover and Fuchs told the UF Faculty Senate on Sept. 23 that they had nothing to do with the hiring of Ladapo, and that there was no pressure on UF Health or College of Medicine to hire him.\nDeSantis also has said that Ladapo landed the twin jobs independently and the UF officials who interviewed him were not aware he was in consideration for the surgeon general post.\n\"Future State of FL surgeon general \u2014 we can accommodate whatever he wants in terms of meeting times!\" Koch replied to the Sept. 3 email.\nEmails show that top administrators walked Ladado through the hiring process, including an interview with Nelson, who oversees two college campuses and hospital systems in Gainesville and Jacksonville, among other duties.\nNelson personally tweaked Ladapo's recommended salary, adjusted his work load, and also sent out talking points to UF Health's communications officer to be transparent about the hiring timeline and to only report Ladapo's \"base salary.\"\nBy Sept. 17, Ladapo had an offer letter for an associate professorship at a base salary of $262,000 plus an extra $75,000 that had not been previously disclosed for running a special projects group out of the senior vice president for health affairs office under Nelson. The state DOH is contributing $150,000 to that UF salary, plus an additional $100,000 for being surgeon general for a grand total of $437,000.\nNelson also cc'd the offer letter to Hosseini.\nHHow much does Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo make? Compare other state workers here\n'Center right, but not far right'\nAt least one administrator remarked on Ladapo's myriad opinion pieces casting doubt on the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine and wearing masks.\n\"Opinion pieces are certainly more conservative than the current public health community, but he is actually more measured and nuanced than either end of the spectrum. Center\u2010right, but not far right,\" noted Dr. Marvin Dewar, senior associate dean at UF and chief executive officer and chief medical officer of UF Health Physicians, the clinical practice arm of the UF College of Medicine.\nSince becoming surgeon general, however, Ladapo has become a lightning rod. He reiterated his stance against masks for children and dismissed critics during an interview with Fox News' host Tucker Carlson Wednesday night.\n\"Nothing anyone says is going to change the approach that we take to public health,' Ladapo said. 'We are not going to be senseless, which characterizes what this past year and a half have been.\"\nDanielle Ivanov, who covers higher education and general assignments for The Gainesville Sun, contributed to this report.\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "Florida Department of Health agrees to settlement, to provide more detailed COVID-19 data\nThe Florida Department of Health has agreed to a lawsuit settlement requiring it to provide more detailed COVID-19 data, after initially refusing and saying it didn't exist.\nThe department will also have to pay the $152,500 in legal fees of the suing attorneys.\nThose attorneys represented former Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, and the Florida Center for Government Accountability.\nThat COVID-19 data will detail vaccination counts, case counts and deaths. It'll be aggregated weekly for the next three years, grouped by county, age group, gender and race.\nThe department provides more general data every two weeks.\n\u201cAll Floridians have a constitutional right to public records and the right to receive critical public health data in a timely manner in order to make informed decisions impacting the health and safety of their families,\" Smith said in a Monday morning press release.\n\"The Department lied about the existence of these public records in court and did everything to restrict information and downplay the threat of COVID even while the Delta variant ripped through Florida \u2014 a decision that cost many lives,\" said Smith, who is currently running for a state Senate seat. \"The DeSantis administration settled in our favor because they knew what they did was wrong.\"\nThe governor's office referred a media request to Florida Department of Health.\nJae Williams, the department's press secretary, called the press release a \"political stunt\" and its characterization strange, pointing to line in the settlement agreement that reads it \"is not and shall not in any way be construed as an admission by any Party of any wrongdoing or any violation of any law.\"\n\"It is unfortunate that we have continued to waste government resources arguing over the formatting of data with armchair epidemiologists who have zero training or expertise,\" he said in an email. \"While some individuals may continue to grapple for political relevancy and disregard providing the public with the truth, we will continue serving Floridians by executing our core mission of protecting, promoting, and improving the health of all people in Florida. \"\nHe emphasized the court did not order the state to display the data. The department had decided to do so, he said.\n\"COVID-19 data will shift from the previously published Biweekly Reports and now solely be available on Florida CHARTS alongside all other public health data,\" he said.\nNews sources joined lawsuit: USA TODAY Network, other Florida news organizations join public records lawsuit\nHow it started: Two months later, finding Florida COVID data by county can be frustrating \u2014 but possible\nWhat's the background on this?\nThe situation started when Smith, at the request of an Orange County Board member, asked the Department of Health for data on pediatric hospitalizations and cases.\nAt the time, Florida was at the epicenter of the 2021 summer COVID-19 surge, fueled by the delta variant, and No. 1 in pediatric cases.\nHis request was denied. According to the department: \u201cThe specific data you have requested for Orange County are considered confidential and exempt from public disclosure\u201d under Florida statutes and rules.\nA little while later, the Florida Center for Government Accountability, a nonprofit watchdog organization, made the same public records request for all of Florida\u2019s 67 counties and was denied for the same reasons.\nFLCGA and Smith filed suit. Several major news media companies, including the USA TODAY Network, joined the suit. So did the First Amendment Foundation.\nThe department claimed in court that the requested records did not exist, according to the press release. But the department released the records in March following a state appellate court order.\nThe parties negotiated a settlement after FLCGA informed the department that those records satisfied the public records requests made almost two years before, according to the release.\n\"The Department hid public records during the height of the pandemic to fit a political narrative that Florida was open for business,\u201d said Michael Barfield, FLCGA's director of public access initiatives. \u201cTransparency and accountability are not negotiable. The Constitution mandates it.\u201d\nDeSantis and COVID-19\nThe settlement comes as DeSantis uses his COVID-19 record to try and gain more support in his White House bid.\nFlorida's governor rose to conservative stardom early in the pandemic in large part due to his COVID-19 polices, such as penalizing mask and vaccine mandates.\nHis administration, at the same time, slow-walked or refused coronavirus-related public information requests, drawing controversy and lawsuits, such as Smith and FLCGA's.\nHe picked Joseph Ladapo as Florida's surgeon general. Ladapo, who's also named in the lawsuit, frequently defies medical consensus to boost vaccine skepticism.\nDeSantis rode his stardom into a presidential campaign, but hasn't managed to reach even shouting distance of former President Donald Trump's dominant lead.\nAttempting to chip away at some of the MAGA vote, DeSantis has elevated coronavirus and vaccine skepticism conspiracies, and attacked Trump for the COVID-19 restrictions that happened during his presidency.\n\"Why are we in this mess? Part of it, and a major reason is because how this federal government handed COVID-19 by locking down this economy,\" DeSantis said during the first GOP presidential primary debate. \"It was a mistake. It should have never happened. And in Florida, we led the country out of lockdown.\"\nThis reporting content is supported by a partnership with Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.

      "text": "Florida Surgeon General Ladapo says he can't 'communicate effectively' in his refusal to wear mask in Polsky's office\nNearly a week later, after coming under increasing criticism from Democrats, lawmakers and others, Florida's top health official posted a statement on his Twitter feed that he was saddened by a state senator's cancer diagnosis but felt wearing a mask during a meeting with her wouldn't have been productive.\n\"Having a conversation with someone while wearing a mask is not something I find productive, especially when other options exist,\" he wrote. \"It is important for me to communicate effectively with people. I can't do that when half of my face is covered.\"\nAccording to Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and two aides arrived at her Tallahassee office Wednesday, Oct. 20. Ladapo had requested a meeting to discuss his confirmation in the Senate after being named to the post by Gov. Ron DeSantis last month.\nPolsky told The Associated Press that Ladapo and two aides were offered masks and asked to wear them when they came in. She did not tell him she had breast cancer \u2014 which she has since made public \u2014 but did say she had a serious condition. Ladapo refused, she said, and offered to sit outside instead.\nLadapo said he offered to find some other solution that would respect both of their preferences, even sitting outside her office in the hallway, but she declined.\nFact checking the Florida surgeon general: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\nWeaponized surgeon general?: Ladapo comes out swinging on social media, at DeSantis' side\n'Fear is done': Florida's new surgeon general outspoken critic of COVID lockdowns, mandates\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cancer patients are at a higher risk to get severely ill from COVID-19 and may not build the same immunity to vaccines.\n\u201cIt was so shocking to me that he treated me in this manner,\u201d Polsky said. \u201cIf he is a surgeon general for the next several years, I am really concerned about a future public health emergency and not being able to rely on him for necessary guidance and proper scientific leadership.\u201d\nHow much does Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo make? Compare other state workers here\nReactions to Dr. Ladapo's response\nAs may be expected, opinions from politicians and social media commentary are all over the place.\nDr. Jennifer Gunther, OB/GYN, echoed several other physicians on Twitter when she said, \"We surgeons manage to have conversations while wearing a surgical mask. As do anesthesiologists and OR nurses and scrub techs and the ECMO teams etc. Should we give up masks in the OR?\"\nAnd some others agreed.\nExpert advice: After senator's clash with Ladapo, expert says take extra precautions around cancer patients\nSenator Lauren Book, Minority Democratic Leader of the Florida Senate, stood with Polsky.\n\"The Surgeon General's actions call into serious question his ability to advise our state on public health policy (as well as his ability to simply be a decent, compassionate human being),\" she tweeted.\nHowever, some Ladapo defenders were quick to point out that Polsky has posted photos of herself around other people without a mask in her office and in meetings.\nSen. Polsky replied with a tweet of her own.\nC. A. Bridges is a Digital Producer for the USA TODAY Network, working with several newsrooms across Florida.

      "text": "Florida Surgeon General Ladapo highlights anti-Fauci rally in Sarasota\n- A \"Freedom Festival\" in Sarasota, Florida, drew hundreds of vaccine skeptics and critics of Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n- Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, known for his questioning of mRNA vaccines, spoke at the event.\n- Ladapo framed the discussion as a \"fight for freedom\" against Fauci's influence.\n- The event was co-hosted by Michelle Pozzie and Victor Mellor, owner of a Republican activist hub.\nOne man wore a Dr. Anthony Fauci mask and a brown arachnid costume.\nAnother wore a T-shirt that read, \"Fauci, Public Enemy Number One.\"\nYet another carried a sandwich board proclaiming, \"Fauci Lied, Many Died.\"\nIt was that kind of scene at the first annual \"Freedom Fest\" held Monday morning at Five Points Park in downtown Sarasota, and the few hundred people who showed up made two things very clear:\nThey are vaccine skeptics.\nAnd they are no fans of Fauci.\nIn case anyone thought they were at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Center, where Fauci spoke on Monday morning as part of the Ringling College Library Association's Town Hall Lecture Series, \"Freedom Fest\" co-host Michelle Pozzie cleared up any confusion at the start of the event.\n\"The only thing that would make this better is if Anthony Fauci was hauled out in an orange jumpsuit,'' she said.\nFauci is the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who served as an advisor to every president since Ronald Reagan until he retired in 2022.\nDuring the COVID pandemic, Fauci was a key member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, though his advice was often discounted by Donald Trump. Fauci later became the chief medical advisor to President Biden before retiring.\nThe headline speaker at Monday's event was Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, who holds a Ph.D from Harvard and has drawn criticism for his questioning of messenger RNA vaccines.\nIn 2023, Ladapo issued official guidance recommending men aged 18-39 avoid the COVID vaccine. Following that, a task force of University of Florida medical school doctors found that Ladapo committed \u201creporting bias by cherry picking results; focusing only on evidence that supports his stance, ignoring contradicting evidence and failing to appropriately acknowledge the limitations of his own data set.\u201d\n\"Whenever there is a message from Dr. Fauci, it's good to have a counter-message,\u2019\u2019 Ladapo said to the Sarasota crowd. \"Fortunately, the counter-message prevails. Dr. Fauci's message is about Dr. Fauci and his interests. And the counter-message is our interests as human beings and what we view is best for humanity and human freedom and human dignity.\"\nThe event's co-host was Victor Mellor, owner of the Hollow 2A in Venice, which is a 10-acre property and a gathering spot for Republican activists.\nMellor, who did not speak at Monday's event, is also co-owner of the We the People Health and Wellness Center in Venice. The center has promoted controversial and unverified COVID treatments.\nLadapo has spoken at the Venice center in the past.\n\"It's one evil after another,\" Ladapo said at Monday's event. \"This is a fight for freedom, a fight for dignity and a fight for being a human being.\""

      "text": "Donna Adelson trial live updates: Closing arguments finish; jury deliberating\nDonna Adelson is in court for her twelfth day of trial in the 2014 murder of Dan Markel.\nAnd it could be her last.\nEach side is expected to present their closing arguments today. Then the judge will give instructions to the jurors before they begin their deliberations. The jury could decide Donna's fate by the end of the day, Friday \u2013 or beyond.\nDonna is accused of helping organize a murder-for-hire scheme that led to two hitmen shooting Markel, her ex son-in-law, in the driveway of his home. At the time, he and his ex-wife, Wendi Adelson, were in the middle of a custody battle as Wendi attempted to relocate to Miami with their two young sons.\nThe 75-year-old is the fifth person to be charged in the infamous murder of Markel, a law professor at Florida State University. She is charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy and solicitation. The killing has led to the convictions of two hitmen, a middleman between the Adelson family and the hitmen and her son Charlie Adelson, who was convicted in the same courtroom in 2023 after just three hours of deliberation.\nHere are the latest updates from the Adelson trial:\nJudge instructs, releases jury to deliberate\nThe jury is finally deliberating after a full day of closing arguments.\nLeon Circuit Judge Stephen Everett gave the jurors final instructions on their duty.\n\"Do not contact anyone to assist you during deliberations,\" Everett said.\n\"It is important that you follow the law spelled out in these instructions as it applies to your verdict,\" he said.\nJurors were allowed to take only their instructions and notes with them to the deliberation room.\nCourt is in recess until a decision comes back or the judge decides to continue deliberations tomorrow.\nState launches into rebuttal\nAssistant State Attorney Georgia Cappleman said everything they've said is for the jury to decide, but she still stands by the evidence the state presented.\n\"I tell you what I think it shows, they tell you what they think it shows,\" she said.\nThis case is not hinged on some bad words, she said.\n\"I'm sorry there's not a smoking gun, but she was too smart for that,\" Cappleman said.\nThe evidence is based on mistakes, mistakes Donna made, she said. Everyone responsible for this murder should be held accountable for the murder.\nCappleman re-emphasized the text Donna sent to Charlie that said she was outside of his house the night of the murder. \"I don't know why she's denying that,\" she said.\nShe argued that after the bump, Donna would've mentioned to Charlie that the extortion is happening again if it had happened in the first place.\nThe defense painted Donna as a caring person, but the problem is that Donna decides what other people need and is willing to justify any means to get to her ends, Cappleman said.\n\"You must not base your verdict on feelings of sympathy,\" Cappleman said. \"Yes she's a grandmother, and most murderers don't look like her, but the evidence has revealed what she is.\"\n\"She was neck deep in this thing,\" she said.\n\"There's only one truth,\" Cappleman said in closing. \"Render a verdict that does justice. Find her guilty.\"\nDefense presents its closing argument\nJackie Fulford, one of Donna Adelson's attorneys, cleared up with the jury that they were not attacking Dan Markel by calling the witnesses they examined.\n\"They've been calling this a bitter custody battle for years,\" Fulford said, referring to the state.\nBut it wasn't, she said, and the defense's witnesses were to testify to that. Luis Rivera and Sigfredo Garcia followed Markel around before ultimately shooting him and leaving him for dead.\n\"Those are the people who killed Danny Markel,\" Fulford said.\nDonna's name never came up when Rivera testified, Fulford said as she reminded the jury that she had Rivera point out people who were involved. He said Donna wasn't involved, Fulford added.\nFulford emphasized that Donna didn't know Wendi Adelson was giving up on trying to relocation. Relocation was the center of Wendi's and Markel's argument during their legal proceedings after the divorce happened.\n\"She gave up because she didn't want it any more, but she didn't tell her mother that,\" Fulford said.\nFulford admitted that Donna had called Markel \"ugly names\" during the divorce but this didn't mean she hated him.\n\"That proves they wanted him killed, are you serious?\" Fulford said. \"You call somebody some bad names and that means you wanted him dead?\"\nThe jury is to judge Donna's conduct leading up to the murder and not once did Donna say she wanted Markel dead or was planning to have someone kill him, she said: \"Calling someone ugly names is not proof.\"\nThe state likes to convey theories and spin evidence, Fulford said. It could be easy to think \"well Charlie did it and it sure looks like Wendi did it,\" but this doesn't mean Donna had anything to do with it, Fulford said.\nAdditionally, Charlie's relationship with Katherine Magbanua has nothing to do with Donna, Fulford said. She pointed to Magbanua's testimony when she said she was hoping to see her kids again. Fulford suggested to the jury that Magbanua is now saying this to help the state prosecute an innocent woman in hopes of getting something out of it.\nOne of the state's arguments focused on Donna's planner with a note to cancel their disability insurance before leaving for Vietnam.\n\"They want you to take what they believe that means,\" Fulford said. The state suggested this was because they were fleeing and didn't intend to come back.\nFulford said the birthday gift for Harvey that the state honed in on was paella, not the murder of Markel. She also poked at Rob Adelson, Donna's estranged son. He hardly spoke with or visited his family during the period in which Markel was killed. He couldn't know the information he testified to because he doesn't talk to them.\n\"This is a guy with an axe to grind,\" Fulford said.\nYou can only make your decision based on the evidence presented to you,\" she said. \"She's a meddler, not a murderer.\"\nNot a single witness connected Donna to the murder, she said. All the state has is that she called him ugly names.\n\"Shame on her getting involved in her daughter's divorce,\" Fulford said.\nFulford reminded the jury of their witnesses' testimony that provided them with context about the divorce process. It was said that it's very common for people to offer financial incentives to settle disputes.\n\"But if Mrs. Adelson does it, she must be up to no good,\" she said.\nDivorce filings were flashed on a projector for the jury. Fulford said that nowhere in there was Markel refusing to let Donna have contact with the children, and if he was so worried about it, he wouldn't have let them stay with her for two weeks.\nDonna also had made a loaf of banana bread the way Markel liked it \u2014 with chocolate chips \u2014 when he was coming by one day.\n\"But she hates him and wants him dead,\" Fulford said. \"It's unbelievable. Us sitting here is actually unbelievable.\"\nThe defense played a recording of Wendi calling her parents at the Tallahassee Police Department to tell them the news about Markel.\n\"Danny has been shot, and I don't think he's going to make it,\" Wendi is heard saying as she rubs her head.\nIt's clear Donna's voice is elevated, and she's concerned, asking for details, Fulford said: \"This is not somebody who has planned for him to be killed.\"\nFulford argued that the text that Donna sent saying she was outside of Charlie's house isn't proof she went to his house after the killing.\n\"I'm not saying that's illogical to jump to that conclusion, but there's no evidence,\" she said.\nThere's also no evidence that Donna kept her money stapled and stacked in the way that the money was when it was paid to the killers. Charlie kept money this way, she said.\nFulford attacked the credibility of the inmates who came before the court and testified. Fulford said that investigators testified that what the inmates said in court is not what she said when the investigators interviewed them.\nAll Donna knew about the murder was what Charlie told her two months later \u2014 his accusation of extortion. She believed it was the truth so she did what he told her to do, Fulford said.\nDonna took the run in with the undercover agent \"very seriously.\" Fulford then played a wiretapped recording of Donna calling the agent.\nThe FBI tried five times to get Donna to pay the money, but Donna kept insisting that it wasn't her and the person should go to the police if they know everything. Fulford asked \"why in the world\" Donna would suggest that if she was guilty.\nThe state's interpretation isn't what matters, the evidence is what matters, she said.\nFulford explained that first-degree murder means Donna intent to kill Markel had to be present in the mind at the time of the killing.\nThey have no evidence of her doing anything until after the murder,\" she said.\nThe state has to show beyond a reasonable doubt that Donna helped people commit the crime. She referred to the the train of communication between Donna, Charlie, Magbanua and the hitmen.\n\"This isn't a train, this is someone's life,\" Fulford said. \"It's Danny Markel's life.\"\nSince Donna was arrested, the state has said she was \"fleeing,\" but the defense says Harvey Adelson, he husband, was trying to get Donna somewhere else to clear her mind because she was threatening to kill herself after Charlie's trial concluded.\n\"When Mrs. Adelson got her visa, there was not a warrant,\" Fulford said. \"She was not doing anything wrong.\"\nMultiple law enforcement agencies have collected hundreds of thousands of emails, thousands of phone calls, she said. The jury has listening to testimony for almost two weeks but nothing that pins Donna to the crime.\n\"Charlie, yep,\" Fulford said. \"Potentially Wendi Adelson, she's the one who said she hated him.\"\n\"Please take this case seriously,\" she added in closing. \"Don't get talked into something you don't agree with.\"\nCourt recesses for lunch; defense's closing to follow\nLeon Circuit Judge Stephen Everett released the court for a lunch break after the state presented its nearly two-hour closing argument.\nEveryone is to return at 1:30 p.m. to hear the defense's closing argument.\nState presents its closing argument\nAssistant State Attorney Georgia Cappleman flashed a picture of Dan Markel for the jury.\n\"This is Dan Markel,\" Cappleman said.\nMarkel was a professor, son, friend, but \"most importantly a father.\" He was a \"pain in Wendi's butt,\" and in Donna's butt, she said.\nCappleman said he wasn't a \"bumbling idiot\" during the divorce like the defense had painted him to be, but rather, he was a Harvard-educated attorney trying to make it impossible for his children to be relocated.\nWendi Adelson's nonnegotiable was also Markel's \u2212 his boys.\n\"The only thing [Markel] was guilty of was fighting like hell for those little boys,\" Cappleman said.\nThe \"beloved\" professor was gunned down, Cappleman said, and Wendi pointed law enforcement to her family when she told them that her parents had more reason to hate Markel than anyone else.\nCharlie was devoted to ensuring he got things done for Donna, who was the \"number one woman in his life.\"\n\"[Donna] micromanaged Wendi's life,\" she said. Donna knows what is best for everyone, and when she can't accomplish it, \"Charlie is her go-to guy to get it done.\"\nFrom the start, Donna was very involved in Wendi's divorce, suggesting Wendi seek a restraining order against Markel, threaten to convert their children to Christianity, among other things.\nCappleman reminded the jury of Rob Adelson's testimony. The estranged Adelson son said his mother has \"rigid\" ideas of what she wants and things are fine when you comply, but when you don't things are not fine.\nAn email from Donna said her life, as well as her husband's life, would be impacted by the denial of a relocation and that Wendi needed to do everything she could to win \u2212 relocation is a \"nonnegotiable.\"\n\"Donna Adelson repeatedly paints Dan Markel\" as an idiot who can't take care of his children, Cappleman said.\nCappleman said that Donna wasn't \"kept in the dark on anything in this family,\" and she knew that relocation was no longer on the table. The defense previously argued that Donna hadn't been informed that Wendi's request was denied so Donna kept scheming up plans to keep trying. Cappleman said this was proven to not be true.\nDonna suggested having the boys baptized in the Catholic Church and also offered Markel $1 million to allow Wendi to move with the boys.\n\"The defendant continues to react to the relocation being denied,\" Cappleman said.\n\"Fight for yourself Wendi,\" Donna wrote in an email that Cappleman read for the jury. \"We'll be there to help you.\"\n\"Giving up was not an option for Donna Adelson,\" Cappleman said. \"Neither was losing.\"\nMarkel would've still been alive had he \"submitted\" to Donna's will and relocated with them to South Florida, she said. \"It was a huge problem, and she made it Charlie's problem,\" she said.\nCharlie was kept in the loop about the divorce proceedings via Donna. On Halloween of 2013, Wendi filed a motion to get Markel to comply with their settlement, and Charlie \"solicited Katherine Magbanua\" for what would become a murder.\nHe asked Magbanua if she knew anyone who could hurt someone, Cappleman said.\nCappleman recounted emails and other proceedings during the divorce filings. He threatened to get a judge involved if Wendi couldn't get Donna to stop disparaging him in front of his children.\nMarkel said he feared the children's best interest wasn't being considered as much as what grandma wanted.\nThe defense tried painting the divorce as amicable and not contentious, but Cappleman said Donna even told Charlie once to not mention the \"divorce drama\" to Wendi, which implies there was some drama.\nCappleman brought up the birthday party and gift for Harvey that the state believes is code for the murder \u2212 the murder being the gift.\nThere were no birthday gifts for Harvey at the party, according to Rob's testimony.\nCharlie joked about hiring a hitman, but he'd been actively pursuing that option since at least Halloween the year prior to the murder, Cappleman said.\nCappleman laid out the trail of phone calls and texts that pinpoint the hitmen's trips to Tallahassee. Sigfedo Garcia and Luis Rivera traveled to Florida's capital city a month before the murder.\nCappleman also showed a note that Donna wrote to herself to notify people that Harvey's birthday party is off if that's what they want to do. Her estranged son testified that there was nothing happening with anyone's health or otherwise that would've warranted a cancellation.\nWhen Charlie would discuss the murder with Magbanua, he would often step in and out to call his mother, returning to stress the point that the murder needed to happen.\nA detailed timeline of the day of the murder was recounted for the jury. Cappleman said Wendi didn't call anyone to make sure Markel or her kids were OK after seeing police were at Markel's house.\n\"[Wendi] suggests Charlie when someone asked who might do this on her behalf,\" Cappleman said. Wendi also expressed relief when her parents seemed surprised that Markel was killed.\nMagbanua's banking records were referenced for the jury, reminding them that Magbanua's account saw a huge spike after the murder, and she wasn't employed at the time. Magbanua made a comment that her money was wet and moldy, and Charlie said this was because his mother washed it, Cappleman said.\nCappleman also mentioned that Rob testified that his mother instructed him not to speak to the FBI, and when he informed her that he had, she said \"he didn't know anything anyway,\" she said.\nOver 40 checks were written to Magbanua from the Adelson Institute, signed by Donna. Harvey, Charlie and her all had signing authority for checks.\n\"But the defendant is the one who wrote that check,\" Cappleman said.\nThe state argued throughout the case that Donna was detail oriented, but Rob testified that his mother said she didn't know nor cared what happened to Markel.\n\"Her total lack of interest in who killed her former son-in-law ... is totally out of character,\" Cappleman said.\n\"There is nothing normal in how the defendant conducts herself\" after the FBI conducted their undercover operation. In the years following Markel's murder, Donna was approached by an undercover agent who was asking her for money for one of the hitmen.\nCappleman said an innocent person would look at the paper that was handed to her and wouldn't walk back down the same street with her young grandchildren where a strange, scary man approached her.\nAfter the operation, which the state has dubbed \"the bump,\" Donna called Charlie. She said the TV was around $5,000. The undercover never mentioned a TV and Charlie is heard \"picking up what she's putting down,\" Cappleman said.\nThe TV is code for the murder, the state has alleged. \"Innocent people do not talk in code,\" she said.\nDuring his trial, Charlie argued that he was being extorted by Magbanua and the hitmen. But Cappleman said you wouldn't have your extorter stay the night with you and be interested in her plans.\nThis extortion theory doesn't hold up, she said, because Donna and Charlie repeatedly said they shouldn't talk on the phone, and if they were innocent they could've talked on the phone.\n\"But they don't do that because it's bull,\" Cappleman said.\nCappleman continued to press and poke holes in this extortion theory. \"They've convinced themselves they're untouchable,\" she said.\nShe referenced Rob's testimony when he said the last time he talked to his mother was on a phone call after Rivera's arrest. He brought the arrest up to her and she didn't say anything about it. They haven't spoken since.\nCappleman said Donna adopted Charlie's theory again when she wrote out his story in the script that she wrote for Drina Bernhardt to use to perjure herself in front of a jury. Bernhardt is an inmate who formerly bunked with Donna in the Leon County Detention Facility.\n\"Regardless of what you think about [Bernhardt and Patricia Byrd], it's clear what the defendant was trying to do with them,\" Cappleman said.\nByrd is another inmate who testified in Donna's trial.\n\"It's true she did not pull the trigger,\" Cappleman said. \"She is accused of first-degree murder as a principle.\"\nCappleman walked the jury through examples that jurors could consider direct evidence: her conversation with her son Rob, telling Charlie the matter involved the two of them, the checks she signed to Magbanua and more.\nShe reminded the jury of Donna's arrest in the airport as she was trying to leave to go to Vietnam, a non-extradition country.\n\"I mean, you all decide if it's a vacation,\" she said.\n\"Don't let the way she thought she'd get away with this be the way she gets away with this,\" Cappleman said in closing. \"Render a verdict that brings justice. Find her guilty.\"\nJudge reads instructions to jury\nLeon Circuit Judge Stephen Everett listed Donna Adelson's charges and facts of the case, charging the jury with the duty to decide her guilt or innocence.\nHe read off the elements that the state had to prove to be convicted of the three charges she's being tried for: first-degree murder, criminal conspiracy and solicitation of murder.\nEach count has different definitions and stipulations that the jury has to weigh and determine if the evidence proves Donna is guilty of these counts beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\"The defendant has entered a plea of not guilty, this means you must presume or believe the defendant is innocent,\" Everett said to jurors.\nIf the doubt is reasonable, \"you must find the defendant not guilty ... If you have no reasonable doubt, you should find the defendant guilty,\" he said.\nThe judge said the jurors are to determine whether the witnesses were credible and truthful. He also said they cannot perceive Donna's choice to not testify as a proof of guilt.\nThe case cannot be decided based on feelings\n\"Whatever verdict you render, the verdict must be unanimous,\" Everett said.\nJury won't consider lesser charges\nDonna Adelson agreed to waive her right to have the jury consider lesser and included charges as they weigh her guilt or innocence.\nLeon Circuit Judge Stephen Everett also denied the defense's request from the previous day to have the entire calendar published into evidence. The state had admitted portions of a 2014 and 2023 calendar as evidence, showing Donna had written Dan Markel's license plate information. Donna's attorneys requested that the calendar be shared in its entirety.\nAfter being denied, Zelman said he'd use it as demonstrative evidence in his closing argument instead.\nThe state and defense are setting up for closing arguments, and the jury will enter the courtroom around 9:20 a.m. Everett reminded the gallery again that no facial expressions or indication of approval or disapproval of arguments will be permitted.\n\"I instruct you to conduct yourself accordingly,\" he said.\nIt's almost the jury's turn\nA jury of 12 \u2013 eight men and six women including two alternates \u2013 will determine the guilt or innocence of Donna Adelson.\nDuring the trial, jurors have filled notebooks and listened intently to hours of testimony and secretly recorded conversations.\nThe jury has been admonished throughout to not talk about the case. That changes when deliberations begin between jurors. There has been no talk of sequestering jurors overnight, and it's unclear how long deliberations may last.\nDonna Adelson remains silent\nThe defense rested its case Sept. 3 after leaving the court on the edge of its seat waiting to hear whether Donna would testify. Leon Circuit Judge Stephen Everett asked Donna and her attorneys at least three times throughout the day if she'd be testifying or invoking her right to remain silent.\nAs the end of the day neared, Donna gave her answer: \"At this time, I don't want to testify.\"\nHer son Charlie Adelson opted to testify during his trial two years ago, a fateful decision that didn't end well. Jurors deliberated only three hours before returning guilty verdicts on all counts. He is serving a life sentence in a South Dakota prison.\nRead more about Donna's decision here.\nGAVEL-TO-GAVEL COVERAGE:\nFor best viewing experience for the trial: Download the Tallahassee Democrat app to watch and receive text alerts on when to watch \u2013 from opening arguments to the verdict.\nThe Tallahassee Democrat will livestream each day of the trial of Donna Adelson from the courthouse in Tallahassee.

      "text": "Florida health officials say most people shouldn't get new COVID shot, contradicting CDC\nContradicting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo said Wednesday that state health officials will recommend against anyone under the age of 65 getting the new COVID-19 vaccine boosters recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nThe CDC is recommending everyone age six months and older receive one new shot from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. The CDC guidance says individuals 65 or older, or who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, can get two new shots.\nLadapo announced the state's new vaccine guidance during a panel discussion with health professionals who were critical of the shoot. The pop-up roundtable was convened and moderated by Gov. Ron DeSantis on the same day he is fundraising for his struggling presidential campaign in Greenwich, Conn.\nDeSantis strongly promoted COVID-19 vaccines when they were first released but has since become one of the most prominent public officials raising questions about their safety, even as federal health officials insist that the benefits of the shots outweigh any risks.\n\u201cI will not stand by and let the FDA and CDC use healthy Floridians as guinea pigs for new booster shots that have not been proven to be safe or effective,\u201d DeSantis said in a press release sent out after the panel discussion.\nThe announcement comes as Florida hospitals are reporting more COVID cases than any other state. Florida\u2019s pandemic death toll has surpassed 90,000 and the weekly new cases topped 24,000 for two consecutive weeks.\nAnti-vaxxer in chief? DeSantis elevates vaccine skepticism to marquee campaign issue\nDeSantis targets Trump on COVID policy as Surgeon General Ladapo's advice again makes Florida an outlier\nWith cases surging again, there has been renewed discussion about what precautions to take, including masking and booster shots. DeSantis has seized on that to tout his record of opposing COVID-19 restrictions, and to criticize former President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic.\nThe COVID discussion is another area where DeSantis has worked to challenge Trump from the right. Trump's administration accelerated the development of the COVID vaccines through Operation Warp Speed. DeSantis has accused Trump of being too deferential to Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of his top COVID advisers. Ladapo has emerged as Florida's anti-Fauci, frequently contradicting the consensus of mainstream health care professionals on COVID issues.\nUnder Ladapo, Florida became the first state to recommend against healthy children receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. The latest announcement again makes Florida an outlier on vaccine guidance.\nLadapo has been strongly criticized by leading health care experts, including for a study he released tying COVID-19 vaccines to heart problems in some patients. DeSantis referenced the study during Wednesday's discussion.\nCritics said the study\u2019s methodology was flawed, and it later was revealed that Ladapo edited the study to remove data that contradicted his conclusions.\n\u201cThat was roundly refuted by the scientific community,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who served on the Food and Drug Administration advisory panel that approved the initial COVID vaccines, previously told the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida. \u201cThat should have been an embarrassment to (DeSantis) and his surgeon general.\u201d\nDeSantis' panel contradicts CDC and FDA\nIn addition to Ladapo, the panel convened Wednesday by DeSantis included Stanford University Health Policy Professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a prominent COVID contrarian who frequently has participated in events organized by the governor, and two other physicians.\nThe panelists raised a number of concerns about the new shots.\n\u201cAt this point with the amount of immunity that\u2019s in the community\u2026 and the questions we have about safety and about effectiveness, but especially about safety, my judgment is that it\u2019s not a good decision for young people and for people who are not at high risk at this point in the pandemic,\u201d Ladapo said of getting an updated vaccine shot.\nBhattacharya said he supports that recommendation.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna hear, I think, from American public health a lot of outcry over the guidance but I think they should be asked: What data are they relying on?\u201d Bhattacharya said.\nThe CDC website says the updated or \u201cbivalent\u201d vaccines protects \u201cagainst both the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the Omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5.\u201d\nFederal officials say the new vaccines are safe and effective.\n\u201cThe FDA is confident in the safety and effectiveness of these updated vaccines, and the agency\u2019s benefit-risk assessment demonstrates that the benefits of these vaccines for individuals 6 months of age and older outweigh the risks,\u201d the FDA said Monday in information posted on its website.\nThe CDC said Tuesday that vaccination is the best way to prevent against COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths and to help people reduce chances of suffering from what is known as \u201clong COVID.\u201d\n\u201cThe virus that causes COVID-19 is always changing, and protection from COVID-19 vaccines declines over time,\u201d the CDC said on its website. \u201cReceiving an updated COVID-19 vaccine can restore protection and provide enhanced protection against the variants currently responsible for most infections and hospitalizations in the United States.\u201d\nSurgeon General's guidance 'a disservice to Floridians,' says public health expert\nDr. Marissa Levine, a public health expert at the University of South Florida-Health and a former Virginia state health commissioner, said the state\u2019s action Wednesday \u201cwas a disservice to Floridians.\u201d\nLevine said it was important for Floridians to consider their own health situation and rely on advice from health care professionals rather than \u201cmaking a decision based on a statement from a politician.\u201d\nShe also disputed the extent of the booster risks raised by DeSantis, Ladapo and the other vaccine skeptics who took part in Wednesday\u2019s online exchange.\n\u201cThe disease itself has risks,\u201d Levine said. \u201cFrom what we see in the data, the risks from COVID are worse than any risk from the vaccine.\u201d\nShe framed the governor\u2019s stance against his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an underlying motivation here that people have to be aware of and it\u2019s not really helpful to the public. It undermines our institutions, which is dangerous and evokes more fear than caring and support,\u201d Levine said.\nThe partisan divide of COVID-19 revealed in polls\nThe impact on Floridians of the state\u2019s recommendation is difficult to gauge. But like with so much involving COVID-19, it is likely to break along partisan lines.\nA new survey by the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic University underscored that division finding that Democratic respondents were significantly more willing to receive ongoing vaccine boosters than their Republican counterparts.\nThe poll, released last week, showed 84% of Democrats ready for boosters compared with 53% of Florida Republicans. Among independent voters, 64.5% said they\u2019ll get boosted.\nRepublicans also reported lower levels of trust in public health guidance and were significantly more likely to believe misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\nIndeed, 50% of state Republican voters surveyed by USF and FAU said the vaccines can cause you to become sick with COVID-19 and another 32% said they cause your DNA to change, neither of which is true.\nInformation from the News Service of Florida was used in this report."

      "text": "As measles spreads, top doctor defies CDC recommendations. Who is Florida\u2019s surgeon general?\nUPDATED 2/27/24: Another case reported in Broward County.\nA highly infectious and potentially fatal airborne disease is spreading in Florida. Federal and medical professional guidelines recommend certain simple steps to control the spread, but Florida's top doctor defies health experts and instead urges parents and guardians to decide whether to keep their exposed children at home away from other kids.\nPreviously, that was COVID-19, which to date has infected at least 8 million Floridians and killed over 94,000. Now it's measles, a highly contagious but easily preventable disease that had been eradicated in the United States but has been making a resurgence as rates of vaccinations drop, according to federal data.\nSix children at Manatee Bay Elementary School, in Westin near Fort Lauderdale, caught the disease over a week ago. New state health data show three more cases of infected children in Broward County, and an adult in Polk County.\nMap: See where measles cases are being reported across the US\nFlorida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo sent a letter to the elementary school parents saying it was \"normally recommended\" for unvaccinated children who have not previously had the disease to be kept home for three weeks \"because of the high likelihood\" they would get infected. But he also said the state would not mandate such a move, saying the Florida Department of Health was \"deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance.\n\"This recommendation may change as epidemiological investigations continue,\" he said.\nMeasles is contagious. It is so contagious that if a person has it, up to 9 or 10 people around them will also get it if they are unvaccinated, according to the CDC. It is so contagious that a child can get measles by being in a room or touching a surface where an infected person has been for up to two hours after that person has left. And an infected person is contagious up to four days before showing any signs of the disease.\nThere is no cure. Health professionals can only treat the symptoms and address complications.\nAbout one in five people who get measles will be hospitalized, the CDC said. One in 10 develop ear infections that can lead to permanent hearing loss. One in 20 will develop pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children, according to the Florida Department of Health. About one in every 1,000 people who get measles will develop brain swelling (encephalitis) that can lead to brain damage, and one to three of those people will die, \"even with the best care,\" the CDC said.\nMeasles is also easily prevented by a regular measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. But trust in vaccines is down and the number of vaccine exemptions has hit a record level, according to federal data.\nWhy is the state's leading medical official promoting parental decisions over community health?\nWho is Dr. Joseph Ladapo, Florida Surgeon General?\nJoseph Abiodun Ladapo, 45, is a Nigerian native and son of a microbiologist who immigrated to the U.S. with his family in the 1980s. Ladapo earned a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from Wake Forest University and an M.D. and a Ph.D in Health Policy from Harvard University. He worked at different hospitals in New York City and served as a professor at the NYU School of Medicine and a staff fellow with the Food and Drug Administration before becoming a researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Ladapo is married, with three young sons.\nLadapo's primary research interests, according to his previous online \"about\" page with UCLA Health, included assessing the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic technologies and reducing the population burden of cardiovascular disease.\nDespite his lack of specialization in infectious disease, he also became prominent in the movement against the mainstream medical community's positions on treatments, vaccines and masking. Ladapo wrote editorials for the Wall Street Journal, USA TODAY and the New York Daily News on the topic, saying masks have \u201clittle or no effect on respiratory virus transmission\u201d despite studies to the contrary and recommending treatments such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which have since been proven ineffective.\nLadapo has been associated with extremist groups such as America's Frontline Doctors and the Tea Party Patriots Action and was a signatory of the Great Barrington Declaration, which criticized most pandemic mitigation measures and instead recommended allowing people to be infected to create a natural, or \"herd,\" immunity, an idea supported by then-President Donald Trump but considered dangerous by researchers and the larger medical community.\nSupporters have said he is an intelligent and credentialed scientist and fully qualified. Some of Ladapo's previous colleagues at UCLA have expressed surprise and shock at his views after the pandemic began.\nWhen did Joseph Ladapo become Florida's Surgeon General?\nIn 2020, then-Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees said in public that to fight the growing dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic Florida might need to practice social distancing well into the next year.\nThis conflicted with Gov. Ron DeSantis' growing message of opening up Florida and getting children back into schools, which turned into claims of governmental oppression and speeches in favor of personal freedom. The state's Surgeon General was kept out of public sight for months, during a global pandemic, before Rivkes retired in 2021. DeSantis replaced him with Ladapo, who had just been hired by the University of Florida College of Medicine, two events that DeSantis said at the time were coincidental.\nThat employment was later discovered to have been fast-tracked with the help of a DeSantis donor, resulting in the governor-appointed Florida Board of Medicine's approval in only two days rather than the usual 2-6 months. Ladapo was reportedly pushed through the UF hiring process. He also received a 52% raise over Rivkees, making him one of the top ten highest-paid Florida government employees.\nLadapo was quick to support DeSantis' views and provided plenty of his own on social media, at public events and on multiple far-right anti-vaccine podcasts, claiming there was a concerted effort to hide stories of people with adverse reactions to vaccines, accusing the government in general and the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, in particular of defrauding the American people, and urging Floridians to follow their intuition over medical professionals.\n\u201cJust check in with your gut. Who do you think you can trust, and go with those individuals,\u201d Ladapo told First Class Fatherhood podcast host Alec Lace.\nDr. Joseph Ladapo's controversy timeline in Florida\nSeptember 2021: Within a day of being hired, Ladapo signed new rules allowing parents to decide if children exposed to people who tested positive for COVID had to quarantine or if they could go to school, eliminating the previous requirement for exposed students to quarantine off campus for at least four days. \"Fear is done,\" he said during a press conference.\nOctober 2021: Ladapo refused to wear a mask at a meeting with Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky even after she told him she had a serious medical condition (later confirmed as breast cancer) and was at a higher risk for serious complications from COVID. After she asked him to leave and word got out, a firestorm erupted with Democrats and members of the medical community castigating him for endangering her life. Ladapo issued a statement nearly a week later saying he was saddened by her diagnosis but didn't think he could communicate effectively with a mask on.\nLadapo appeared at DeSantis' side in public appearances, promoting monoclonal antibody treatment, supporting the governor's views on blocking vaccine and mask mandates and accusing the public health community of fearmongering. Critics accused him of spreading misinformation that led to people being hesitant or afraid of vaccines.\nDecember 2021: The Florida Department of Health rejected a complaint about Ladapo that said he violated state medical laws by publicly casting doubts about COVID vaccines and promoting unproven treatments.\nJanuary 2022: Senate Democrats all walked out of Ladapo's confirmation hearing before the Senate Health Policy Committee after what they said was a lack of honest answers about his qualifications and the current state of the pandemic during a lengthy interview.\nAt a press conference that month, DeSantis and Ladapo told Floridians who weren't showing symptoms not to get tested. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have symptoms, you are not a case,\" Ladapo said.\nAccording to the CDC, asymptomatic people with COVID can still pass it on to more vulnerable people and they may still develop debilitating long COVID themselves weeks later. Epidemiologists were also quick to point out that early diagnosis means early treatment, and researchers use testing to track infection paths and variant strengths.\nFebruary 2022: During his confirmation hearing Ladapo dodged questions about vaccine effectiveness, how much time he actually spent at UF, whether he had been vaccinated himself, and his connections with \"fringe medical group\" America\u2019s Frontline Doctors. He was ultimately confirmed along party lines.\nApril 2022: Ladapo's FDOH cited a study by an Australian pediatrician to support restricting transgender health care. The pediatrician, Dr,. Ken Pang, strongly objected to the medical board, saying his research was misrepresented and showed exactly the opposite. \"To be seeing the research we've done being utilized in this way \u2014 I was just dismayed by that,\u201d Pang told VICE.com.\nJune 2022: DeSantis and the FDOH, under Ladapo, refused to pre-order COVID-19 vaccines for children under five when they became available, the only U.S. state to do so, citing the lack of need and the risks. Ladapo appeared before Congress to defend the state's decision and said the state didn't recommend vaccines for children under 18.\nOctober 2022: Ladapo urged men younger than 40 to avoid the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccine and booster shots because of the \"abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men in this age group,\" citing an anonymous non-peer-reviewed analysis from the FDOH. The move prompted a backlash from doctors, researchers and the federal government. At the time, Florida was leading the country in COVID deaths for the third month in a row.\nJanuary 2023: A task force of UF medical school doctors concluded that the FDOH recommendation against COVID vaccines for young men was of \u201chighly questionable merit\" and that Ladapo cherry-picked data to support his stance. Politico went further and, after examining different drafts of the analysis, reported that Ladapo had personally changed the study to remove data that contradicted his views. Ladapo has denied this.\nMarch 2023: In response to a letter from Ladapo demanding answers based on his own research on vaccine safety, the FDA and CDC asked him to stop disproportionally focusing on the small number of adverse effects in the studies of 13 billion COVID shots given around the world while ignoring the number of people the vaccines have saved. \"Unfortunately, the misinformation about COVID-19 vaccine safety has caused some Americans to avoid getting the vaccines they need to be up to date,\" the letter reads.\nApril 2023: The FDOH under Ladapo stopped reporting COVID infections and deaths to the federal government\nSeptember 2023: Ladapo recommended against anyone under the age of 65 getting the new COVID-19 vaccine booster the FDA approved to combat new, more infectious variants, directly contradicting CDC guidance. He claimed that the mRNA boosters altered human DNA, which the CDC and multiple studies have said is false.\nNovember 2023: After a two-year battle over COVID public records, the FDOH under Ladapo settled a lawsuit about withholding COVID data and released information spanning the entire duration of the pandemic on the state's FLHealthCHARTS.gov site. However, the agency also stopped providing cumulative totals, percentages, new case positivity, data on booster doses and overviews that made it easier to see trends.\nJanuary 2024: Ladapo made headlines again by \"calling for a halt to the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\" because he said he didn't receive an adequate response from the FDA about the safety of vaccines. Meanwhile, Florida was seeing a spike in new COVID cases and hospitalizations."

      "text": "Florida is only state not to pre-order COVID-19 vaccines for kids under 5\nTo stay connected with our comprehensive coverage of COVID-19 in Florida, sign up for our Coronavirus Watch newsletter.\nGov. Ron DeSantis' administration has chosen not to pre-order thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses for children under 5 from the federal government even though vaccines may be approved by federal regulators and become available nationwide as early as next week.\nFlorida is the only U.S. state to skip ordering advance shots that medical experts say have more benefits than risks at preventing young children from contracting the deadly coronavirus.\nDeSantis on Thursday defended Florida\u2019s choice against pre-ordering COVID-19 vaccines for children under the age of five.\n\u201cOur Department of Health has been very clear,\u201d DeSantis said at a press conference in Miami. \u201cThe risks outweigh the benefits and we recommend against.\u201d\nDeSantis blamed \u201cmedia hysteria\u201d and misinformation as the motive for many parents urging vaccinations upon young children, despite a health panel recently saying the vaccine is safe for children six months and older.\nDeSantis said Floridians are still \u201cfree to choose,\u201d but explained Florida will not use state resources to inoculate young children.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a surplus of this. Doctors can get it. Hospitals can get it. But there\u2019s not going to be any state programs that are going to be trying to get COVID jabs to infants and toddlers and newborns. That\u2019s not something we think is appropriate.\u201d\nNearly 75,000 Floridians have died from COVID-19, while almost 6.3 million cases have been officially reported since the pandemic began in 2020.\nNews of Florida\u2019s decision was first reported Wednesday by the McClatchy Washington Bureau. Citing two unnamed U.S. government sources, the news outlet said the state missed a Tuesday deadline to request the delivery of COVID-19 pediatric vaccines.\nPrevious coverage: Florida to be first state to recommend healthy kids not get COVID-19 vaccine, contradicting CDC\nIn case you missed it: Florida leads nation in new COVID deaths, CDC data shows\nIt was unclear Thursday morning whether the state's action could delay access to the vaccines for parents wanting them once they are approved.\nWhen asked by a USA TODAY Network-Florida reporter why the state didn\u2019t order the vaccines for kids, the Florida Department of Health released an email statement that the agency \u201cmade it clear to the federal government that states do not need to be involved in the convoluted vaccine distribution process.\u201d\nThe statement added that the federal government \u201chas a track record of developing inconsistent and unsustainable COVID-19 policies.\u201d\n\u201cIt is also no surprise we chose not to participate in distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine when the [Health] Department does not recommend it for all children,\u201d it said.\nCan Florida doctors get the vaccine for young children?\nThe department said doctors can order vaccines on their own \u2014 and confirmed that \u201cthere are currently no orders in the [Health] Department\u2019s ordering system for the COVID-19 vaccine for this age group.\u201d\nFor the past two years, DeSantis has forged an alliance with those who don\u2019t support any form of requirement to blunt the pandemic \u2014 signing laws that bar employers, schools and local governments from demanding masks and vaccines.\nHe\u2019s blasted COVID-19 policies by other state and local governments, the Biden administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNo vaccine needed to compete: Special Olympics drops COVID-19 vaccine requirement after Florida threatens $27.5M in fines\nLast week, DeSantis forced the Special Olympics International to drop its requirement that athletes competing in Orlando show proof of COVID-19 vaccinations after threatening to slap it with $27.5 million in fines for violating Florida\u2019s anti-mandate law. The organization abandoned the requirement.\nFlorida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who was appointed by DeSantis and leads the state health department, has long opposed coronavirus vaccination requirements. On Tuesday, he said he does not support vaccinating young children, according to the News Service of Florida.\n\u201cFrom what I have seen, there is just insufficient data to inform benefits and risk in children,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe expect to have good data that the benefits outweigh the risks of any therapies or treatments before we recommend those therapies or treatments to Floridians. That is not going to change. I don\u2019t think that is particularly radical. I think it\u2019s very sensible,\u201d he said.\nFDA approves of vaccines for small children\nThe Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisers on Wednesday gave a thumbs-up to vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer for the littlest kids.\nThe outside experts voted unanimously that the benefits of the shots outweigh any risks for children under 5 \u2014 that\u2019s roughly 18 million youngsters. They are the last age group in the U.S. without access to COVID-19 vaccines and many parents have been eager to protect their little children.\nPositive review: FDA advisers to review, likely recommend COVID-19 vaccines for young children this week\n\u201cThis is a long-awaited vaccine,\u201d said FDA panel member Dr. Jay Portnoy. \u201cThere are so many parents who are absolutely desperate to get this vaccine, and I think we owe it to them to give them a choice to have the vaccine if they want to.\u201d\nDr. Peter Marks, FDA\u2019s vaccine chief, opened the meeting with data showing a \u201cquite troubling surge\u2019\u2019 in young children\u2019s hospitalizations during the omicron wave, and noted 442 children under 4 have died during the pandemic. That\u2019s far fewer than adult deaths, but should not be dismissed in considering the need for vaccinating the youngest kids, he said.\n\u201cEach child that\u2019s lost essentially fractures a family,\u2019\u2019 Marks said.\nIf the FDA agrees with its advisers and authorizes the shots, there's one more step. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will decide on a formal recommendation after its own advisers vote on Saturday. If the CDC signs off, shots could be available as soon as Monday or Tuesday at doctor's offices, hospitals and pharmacies.\nPfizer\u2019s vaccine is for children 6 months through 4 years; Moderna\u2019s vaccine is for 6 months through 5 years.\nContributing: USA Today Network-Florida Politics Editor Zac Anderson, breaking news reporter Jason Delgado and The Associated Press."

      "text": "Great Barrington Declaration\nAs infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection.\n941,261 Signatures\nThe Great Barrington Declaration\nThe Great Barrington Declaration \u2013 As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection.\nComing from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health \u2013 leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice.\nKeeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.\nFortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza.\nAs immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all \u2013 including the vulnerable \u2013 falls. We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity \u2013 i.e. the point at which the rate of new infections is stable \u2013 and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.\nThe most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.\nAdopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19. By way of example, nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent testing of other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be minimized. Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home. When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside. A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches to multi-generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals.\nThose who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.\nOn October 4, 2020, this declaration was authored and signed in Great Barrington, United States, by:\nDr. Martin Kulldorff, professor of medicine at Harvard University, a biostatistician, and epidemiologist with expertise in detecting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks and vaccine safety evaluations.\nDr. Sunetra Gupta, professor at Oxford University, an epidemiologist with expertise in immunology, vaccine development, and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases.\nDr. Jay Bhattacharya, professor at Stanford University Medical School, a physician, epidemiologist, health economist, and public health policy expert focusing on infectious diseases and vulnerable populations.\nCo-signers\nMedical and Public Health Scientists and Medical Practitioners\nDr. Alexander Walker, principal at World Health Information Science Consultants, former Chair of Epidemiology, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, USA\nDr. Angus Dalgleish, oncologist, infectious disease expert and professor, St. George\u2019s Hospital Medical School, University of London, England\nDr. Anthony J Brookes, professor of genetics, University of Leicester, England\nDr. Ariel Munitz, professor of clinical microbiology and immunology, Tel Aviv University, Israel\nDr. Boris Kotchoubey, Institute for Medical Psychology, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany\nDr. David Katz, physician and president, True Health Initiative, and founder of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, USA\nDr. David Livermore, microbiologist, infectious disease epidemiologist and professor, University of East Anglia, England\nDr. Eitan Friedman, professor of medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel\nDr. Ellen Townsend, professor of psychology, head of the Self-Harm Research Group, University of Nottingham, England\nDr. Florian Limbourg, physician and hypertension researcher, professor at Hannover Medical School, Germany\nDr. Gerhard Kr\u00f6nke, physician and professor of translational immunology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany\nDr. Gesine Weckmann, professor of health education and prevention, Europ\u00e4ische Fachhochschule, Rostock, Germany\nDr. G\u00fcnter Kampf, associate professor, Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Greifswald University, Germany\nDr. Helen Colhoun, professor of medical informatics and epidemiology, and public health physician, University of Edinburgh, Scotland\nDr. Karol Sikora, physician, oncologist, and professor of medicine at the University of Buckingham, England\nDr. Lisa White, professor of modelling and epidemiology, Oxford University, England\nDr. Matthew Ratcliffe, professor of philosophy, specializing in philosophy of mental health, University of York, England\nDr. Michael Levitt, biophysicist and professor of structural biology, Stanford University, USA.\nRecipient of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nDr. Mike Hulme, professor of human geography, University of Cambridge, England\nDr. Motti Gerlic, professor of clinical microbiology and immunology, Tel Aviv University, Israel\nDr. Partha P.

      "text": "Whooping cough cases in Florida increase eightfold from 2023 to 2024, state says\nFollowing a nationwide trend, incidences of whooping cough have increased to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe number of whooping cough cases in Florida soared in 2024.\nFrom Jan. 1, 2024 to Dec. 31, 2024, the Florida Department of Health reported 715 cases of pertussis \u2013 an eight-fold increase over the year before, which had 85 cases.\nFollowing a nationwide trend, incidences of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, have been increasing to pre-pandemic levels. But in 2024 in Florida, the number of cases was still almost double that of 2019, which recorded 359 cases.\nThe preventative measures used to combat COVID-19, like masks and social distancing, also stopped other respiratory viruses, like pertussis, said Jerne Shapiro, a professor specializing in epidemiology at the University of Florida's College of Public Health and Health Professions.\nThose measures are now gone. Coupled with a vaccination rate in Florida that doesn't hit herd immunity, that's why the number of pertussis cases is on the rise in the state.\nThe age group with the most pertussis cases in 2024 was children up to 4 years old.\nWhooping cough, also known as pertussis, is an infection caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. Babies and small children are particularly vulnerable, and may experience apnea (or pauses in breathing), pneumonia, seizures and brain damage, leading to death.\nLast October, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than five times as many whooping cough cases in the country than the year before.\nWhile one COVID-infected person usually infects about two people, with pertussis one infected person can spread the bacteria to as many as 15 people with no immunity.\n\"We have pockets of community members that have very low vaccination rates,\" Shapiro said. If pertussis \"makes its way into one of those communities that has low vaccination rates, we are much more likely to see an outbreak occur in that population group.\"\nDOH reported Taylor and Madison counties with the highest incidence of pertussis from July 2024 to October 2024.\nCurrently in Florida, the vaccination rate for those who have completed all five doses of the tdap vaccine, which prevents tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, is about 88.1 percent, Shapiro said. Herd immunity for pertussis requires 92 to 94 percent.\n\"We don't have the high enough levels to prevent community transmission,\" Shapiro said. A request for comment with DOH is still pending.\nWhat is whooping cough?\nThe illness is called whooping cough because the bacteria produces a toxin that causes inflammation in the respiratory tract and paralysis of the larynx, or voice box, which can make it difficult to cough.\nThe person cannot breathe until the larynx relaxes, Shapiro said, and the inhalation is what causes that \"whoop\" sound.\n\"So it's cough, cough, cough, and then you hear from the patient as they try to breathe back in, and that is where the term whoop comes from,\" Shapiro said. \"If you've ever seen someone who's had it and you watch them and they cannot breathe, it is scary.\"\nPertussis is sneaky. It starts as a regular cough and then develops into a more insidious illness. \"... It's not until after one or two weeks that the second stage of pertussis begins, and people realize just how sick they are,\" she said.\nPertussis can be treated early with antibiotics, and a person can be given preventative antibiotics if they know they've been in contact with someone who was sick, though it gets misdiagnosed quite frequently.\n\"They just think, you know, a respiratory illness, you'll be okay, and then, unfortunately, it is pertussis,\" she said. \"They're around a young child or someone who has other adverse medical conditions, and in that person, we see a totally different disease presentation.\"\nAbout the tdap vaccine\nTo prevent pertussis, there is a series of five vaccinations given from 2 months the the age of 4 to 6. Even those with one vaccine will still have partial protection with less severe outcomes.\n\"Our youngest children don't have fully developed immune systems to begin with, and they have more difficulty clearing mucus. They don't have very good, strong sneezing and coughing mechanisms built up,\" Shapiro said.\nWhat's known as the tdap vaccine (short for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) can wane over time, Shapiro said, and she recommends getting a booster every 10 years., especially if you're pregnant or elderly.\n\"It's also important that close contacts to our under 1 population, so our grandmas, our grandpas, anyone that also might be a caregiver, gets updated on their vaccine as well,\" she said.\nFlorida requires children entering a public school in kindergarten through 12th grade to have at least four doses of the tdap vaccine, though the state does allow for religious exemptions \"if immunizations are in conflict with the religious tenets and practices of the child's parent or guardian,\" according to the state health department.\nMedical providers in Florida say vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the rising number of cases of pertussis and other diseases like measles. Especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, state officials like Gov. Ron DeSantis and Dr. Joseph Ladapo, the state's surgeon general, have supported messaging that some doctors say contains misinformation about mRNA vaccines.\nAccording to a Florida Department of Health report for July 2024, the proportion of children 5-17 with new religious exemptions are increasing each month. St. John\u2019s, Flagler, Sarasota and Walton counties have the highest number of children with religious exemptions, according to that data.\nAna Go\u00f1i-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida, can be reached at agonilessan@gannett.com."

Ron DeSantis appointed his new controversial surgeon general, the Florida Senate will finally get to question Dr. Joseph Ladapo about his qualifications for handling a pandemic and running the state\u2019s public health agency.\nExpect a \u201cvigorous, even fiery debate\u201d when Ladapo appears Wednesday morning before the Senate Health Policy Committee, Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book of Plantation said in a phone interview Tuesday.\nShe and her colleagues plan to question him about his lack of experience dealing with pandemics and other public health crises, his controversial views that go against the mainstream medical community, and his lack of administrative experience.\nRecent coverage from the USA TODAY Network-Florida:\n- DeSantis, Ladapo condemn feds\u2019 decision to stop sending COVID-19 antibody treatments\n- No classes yet assigned for Surgeon General Ladapo at UF College of Medicine\n- Florida Department of Health rejects complaint against Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo\n- COVID in Florida: Decoding the data behind state surgeon general's policies\n- A 'trifecta' of 'lunacy': Why Florida's COVID response favors treatment, not prevention\n\u201cI know the members of our caucus are looking forward to having a serious conversation and have concerns about his ability to lead,\u201d Book said.\nFor example, when Ladapo appeared before the Health and Human Services Appropriations Committee earlier this month, Book said, he didn\u2019t have a \u201csingle slide or chart about COVID, where we are and what we\u2019re doing about it.\u201d\nSo far, the only Republican to break ranks and criticize Ladapo has been Senate President Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, who oversees the confirmation process by assigning which committees get to question Ladapo about his qualifications.\nIn a memo to senators, Simpson said Ladapo\u2019s refusal to honor state Sen. Tina Polsky\u2019s request to wear a mask when he came to meet with her in her Tallahassee office was unprofessional. Polsky is undergoing cancer treatments.\nRead more:\n- Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo asked to leave meeting after refusing to wear mask\n- Florida Surgeon General Ladapo says he can't 'communicate effectively' in his refusal to wear mask in Polsky's office\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a cancer diagnosis for people to respect each other\u2019s level of comfort with social interactions during a pandemic,\u201d said Simpson, who did not mention Ladapo by name in the memo.\nThe governor\u2019s office has repeatedly pointed to Ladapo\u2019s pedigree with his medical degree and Ph.D. from Harvard University and his several years as a clinical researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles studying obesity and cardiac disease. A request for comment was pending Tuesday afternoon.\nThe only statutory requirement for surgeon general, a position created in 2007 by then-GOP Gov. Charlie Crist, is that the person be a physician licensed under state law with \u201cadvanced training or extensive experience in public health administration.\u201d\nA lightning rod surgeon general\nSince since the day he was appointed, Ladapo\u2019s actions and statements dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 while they fall in line with the views of DeSantis \u2014 have raised concerns among Democrats and those in the mainstream medical community.\nAlso, his fast-track hire at the University of Florida has raised questions about political pressure from DeSantis megadonor and UF Board of Trustees Chairman Mori Hosseini to get Ladapo a job with an income that would supplement his salary with the Department of Health.\nFast tracked: Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show\nLadapo\u2019s controversial views on vaccinations and masking were well documented, including his appearance with America\u2019s Frontline Doctors on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court urging the use of hydroxychloroquine, which has proven ineffective against COVID-19.\nDemocrats objected when, on his second day on the job, Ladapo issued an emergency order stripping school districts of the authority to quarantine students exposed to COVID-19, letting the parents instead decide whether to send their kids to school.\nMore recently, the Department of Health overseen by Ladapo placed an Orange County health official on administrative leave for sending an email out questioning why so few of his own staff were vaccinated.\n\u201cI want to hear his thought process on that,\u201d Book said.\nShe also plans to ask if he regrets his treatment back in November of Polsky, D-Boca Raton, \u201cand his whole off-hand comment made for refusing to wear a mask.\u201d He refused her request to wear a mask to enter her office, even after she said she was dealing with a serious medical issue that was later revealed to be cancer treatments.\nLadapo said he tried to accommodate her by meeting outside and said he couldn\u2019t express himself properly while wearing a mask over his mouth.\nThe confirmation hearing scheduled on Wednesday morning before the Senate Health Policy Committee is the first of two stops before his nomination comes to a full Senate floor vote. Despite their opposition, those inside the legislative process expect the Republican-controlled Senate to ultimately confirm Ladapo\u2019s nomination along party lines.\n\u201cDr. Ladapo has proven time and time again that data and science are not top of mind when making decisions about the health and wellness of Floridians,\u201d said Sen. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, who also sits on the Health Policy Committee. \u201cAt a time with so much misinformation flying, it's important to have Florida\u2019s top doc grounded in facts and not extreme political rhetoric.\"\nShe said she is convinced his confirmation will be approved along party lines, in which case she hopes he will revisit his medical training \u201cand use constructive common sense above destructive divisive decision making as he leads Floridians everywhere through this pandemic.\u201d\n\u2018Where are his bona fides?\u2019\nHouse Minority Leader Evan Jenne of Dania Beach said he\u2019d like to see his Senate colleagues focus on the particulars of Ladapo\u2019s resume.\n\u201cWhat I would like to see personally, and a lot of colleagues would want to see, is the fleshing out of his actual expertise dealing with medical emergencies like we\u2019re going through,\u201d Jenne said during a press briefing Monday. \u201cAs I read through his CV, there is a lot of great work, but \u2026 it has nothing to do with the pandemic. Where are his bona fides with that?\u201d\nRep. Fentrice Driskell, D-Tampa, said she would like her Senate colleagues to probe into Ladapo\u2019s ideas and theories with respect to COVID-19, \u201cto compare and contrast those to what the prevailing thoughts are in the science and medical community.\u201d\nShe said it would be interesting to see what information the governor\u2019s office sends over to the Senate, if anything.\nThe meeting packet for Wednesday\u2019s hearing before the Senate Health Policy Committee doesn\u2019t contain Ladapo\u2019s resume or medical license application, or any other documents regarding his background.\nIt does contain a handful of documents related to Ladapo\u2019s appointment: A notice from DeSantis to Secretary of State Laurel Lee dated Sept. 21 that he\u2019s appointed Ladapo as Surgeon General, Ladapo\u2019s signed oath of office dated Nov. 17, 2021, a notice of certification from the Secretary of State acknowledging Ladapo\u2019s appointment, and a hearing notice of the Senate Health Policy Committee dated Jan. 20 and signed by the committee chair, Sen. Manny Diaz, R-Hialeah Gardens.\nBut the Senate President's Office said Ladapo\u2019s professional licenses were investigated and confirmed through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement background check requested by the Senate.\nAlso, as part of the confirmation process, the Senate orders a separate background check on all appointees.\nAnd Ladapo completed the Senate\u2019s Confirmation Questionnaire, which includes the type of information listed on a resume or curriculum vitae. Senators also had a chance to discuss Dr. Ladapo\u2019s qualifications and background during individual meetings over the last several weeks.\n'Grave concerns': Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo's medical license OK'd in two days\nTwo chances to get Ladapo confirmed\nEven if Democrats can muster enough Republicans to reject Ladapo\u2019s appointment, Florida law and Senate rules give the governor two cracks at getting him confirmed, allowing him to be confirmed in a second consecutive legislative session.\nThat would allow Ladapo to remain as surgeon general through 2023.\nUnlike his predecessor, Scott Rivkees, Ladapo has only had a few months on the job before he underwent the crucible of Senate hearings to confirm him.\nRivkees was appointed by DeSantis during the waning days of the 2019 session. At the time, then-Senate President Bill Galvano decided there was not enough time to properly vet the UF pediatrician after allegations were raised about a sexual harassment investigation and an audit of his finances were disclosed.\nDespite those concerns, Rivkees stayed on the job without confirmation for nearly a year until the Senate was able to vet him.\nBy the time the Senate confirmed Rivkees by a 31-9 vote on March 13, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had hit Florida and Rivkees had been on the job for a year.\n\u201cAt least there was some glimmer of hope when he spoke about the need to wear masks, but Ladapo is spewing nonsense,\u201d Book said. \u201cLadapo has turned his position into a pulpit to spew misinformation about the pandemic.\n\u201cThis is someone we should be able to rely upon to make sound decisions about the health, safety and well being of Floridians everywhere,\u201d she added.\nLadapo was hired at the same time as his appointment to a research professor post at the University of Florida College of Medicine. His contract with the state runs until September 2023, with the option of a three-year extension. His combined salary is $437,000 a year. The longest he can serve as surgeon general is two years, with a three-month extension.\nWhat the confirmation hearings will hopefully show is that this was a political pick, Jenne said: \u201cThe Surgeon General in Florida decision is being based purely on politics and has nothing to do with actual science and medical science.\u201d\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "DeSantis announces new UF professor as Florida's next surgeon general\nGov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday afternoon Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo as his pick for Florida's next surgeon general and secretary of the Florida Department of Health.\nLadapo is also a new hire at the University of Florida College of Medicine. His expertise is in cardiovascular health and preventive medicine but, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, he has been a vocal critic of extended lockdowns and mask mandates. He has raised doubts about the safety of vaccines now fully approved by federal regulators.\n\"We feel that Joe is just the right guy for the job,\" DeSantis said Tuesday in a press conference.\nMore: Gainesville area hospitals find relief with fewer COVID-19 patients\nMore: DeSantis, Moody vow to support Gainesville employees in fight against vaccine mandate\nLadapo was made a professor of medicine with UF effective Monday with a salary of $262,000, according to UF Health spokesman Ken Garcia. Florida's former surgeon general, Dr. Scott Rivkees, also is employed with the university.\nIn an emailed news release from the Governor's Press Office, Ladapo said he was honored to be chosen for the state leadership role.\n\"From California, I have observed the different approaches taken by governors across the country, and I have been impressed by Governor DeSantis\u2019 leadership and determination to ensure that Floridians are afforded all opportunities to maintain their health and wellness, while preserving their freedoms as Americans,\" his statement said. \"It is a privilege to join his team and serve the people of Florida.\"\nDuring the live announcement, Ladapo said he hopes Florida will set a public health example for other states and discussed his policy priorities.\n\"Florida will completely reject fear,\" he said. \"We're done with fear. That's been something that's been unfortunately a center piece of health policy in the United States ever since the beginning of the pandemic, and it's over here.\"\nHe also emphasized a need for science and opinions to be completely separated and clear.\nAs state surgeon general for the next two years, Garcia stated, the doctor is still a university employee appointed to the state role through a structure in Florida Statute 112.24 known as an \"intergovernmental interchange of public employees.\"\nThe spokesman said UF was told by DeSantis' office that Ladapo was under consideration for state surgeon general and that the doctor separately and independently reached out to UF about a potential job opportunity filling an existing vacant position in the College of Medicine.\n\"He was evaluated as we would any other candidate,\" Garcia said.\nLadapo's position at UF will come with tenure subject to approval by the UF Board of Trustees. The first step in the process was a vote from faculty completed last week, but Garcia said in an email Tuesday that the results of the vote are confidential.\nLadapo will lead a special projects group to develop policies and interventions to reduce health disparities, Garcia wrote. He comes as a scientist and researcher with over $1.87 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.\nComments from university faculty about Ladapo's appointment were favorable, he wrote in the email.\n\"Dr. Ladapo\u2019s faculty appointment represents a tremendous opportunity for UF,\" Garcia said. \"We look forwarding to continuing to partner with the state Department of Health to leverage our scientific strengths and statewide resources to tackle health challenges in Florida and beyond, and to maintain the close linkages we\u2019ve had with the state university system and the Department of Health that have worked so well throughout the pandemic.\"\nLadapo declined to answer questions in a phone call with a reporter from The Sun and instead said to contact the Governor's Press Office.\nWhat is his background?\nLadapo earned his medical degree in 2008 from Harvard Medical School along with a Ph.D. in health policy from Harvard University. He started at the University of California - Los Angeles as an associate professor-in-residence in July of 2016. In May 2020, he became an associate professor with tenure, according to his curriculum vitae.\nHe was previously a staff fellow with the Food and Drug Administration from November 2012 to January 2014, and a faculty member at New York University School of Medicine.\nLadapo's primary research interests, according to his online about page with UCLA Health, include assessing the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic technologies and reducing the population burden of cardiovascular disease. Many of his published papers focus on topics about cardiovascular health, smoking and HIV.\nThe son of a microbiologist, Ladapo is married and has three young sons, according to DeSantis' announcement. He was born in Nigeria and immigrated to the U.S. with his family when he was five years old.\nPrevious COVID-19 comments\nLadapo is not an epidemiologist, but he has written extensively on matters of public health and COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.\nOver the past year and a half, he wrote over a dozen opinion pieces about the virus, related policies and research published online with the Wall Street Journal, New York Daily News and USA TODAY.\nIn some, he wrote about limitations of mask mandates and recommended short lockdown periods. In others, he touched on COVID-19 vaccine risks and pandemic policies in schools, suggesting symptom monitoring and periodic testing instead of vaccine mandates for children.\nOne, written by Ladapo and another doctor and published Oct. 13 with New York Daily News, discussed the benefits of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that had specifically not been recommended for COVID-19 treatment by both the FDA and NIH months earlier.\n\"Because of the medication\u2019s politicization, and the pernicious tendency for dissenting perspectives to be silenced during the pandemic, data supporting hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness have been almost inaudible,\" it stated. \"People in the United States and around the world should have access to it, and physicians should feel empowered to prescribe hydroxychloroquine to their vulnerable patients.\"\nMost of the opinion pieces discussed how policy decisions should not be based on or driven by fear but rather focus on protecting the vulnerable, helping hospitals, allowing social and economic aspects of life to continue and not silencing less popular or politically unfavored protests and science.\nThe Sun emailed and called three epidemiology experts with UF on Tuesday for comment on Ladapo's COVID-19 writings. One was out of the office, one declined and the third did not answer."

Ron DeSantis said at Joseph Ladapo's introduction that he didn't think anyone at UF knew about his new surgeon general. Emails show otherwise.\nTop brass at the University of Florida College of Medicine fast-tracked the hiring of Dr. Joseph Ladapo, knowing that Gov. Ron DeSantis was eyeing him for the position of state surgeon general, according to emails obtained by the USA TODAY Network-Florida.\nThey also knew they needed to get it done quickly to coincide with the governor\u2019s desire to announce Ladapo\u2019s appointment the day after his predecessor \u2014 Dr. Scott Rivkees, also a UF College of Medicine professor \u2014 stepped down.\nAnd they knew that Ladapo had the backing of UF President Kent Fuchs, Provost Joe Glover and UF Board of Trustees Chairman Mori Hosseini \u2014 a major GOP fundraiser and DeSantis supporter.\nRead more about Joseph Ladapo, Florida's new surgeon general:\n- Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo asked to leave meeting after refusing to wear mask\n- Fact checking the Florida surgeon general: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\n- Weaponized surgeon general?

Polsky: Under fire, Florida surgeon general says he can't communicate clearly while masked\nHis statement contradicts comments made by DeSantis at a Sept. 21 press conference introducing Ladapo and announcing him as the replacement for Rivkees, who had been state surgeon general since April 2019.\n\"I don't think anyone who interviewed him knew he was going to be appointed to this,\" DeSantis said, adding that he thought Ladapo had pursued the UF job on his own. \"It wasn't anything we had done, and obviously we wanted to see how that shaped out before we formally offered him.\"\nDeSantis chose the Harvard medical school graduate and clinical professor from UCLA because of his credentials, but also because Ladapo's views against mask mandates and vaccines are in line with the governor\u2019s.\n'Some sensitivities regarding timing'\nNelson oversees all of UF Health, a massive operation with two campuses and separate hospitals in Gainesville and Jacksonville, six colleges and eight research centers, and more than 100 physician practices, according to his webpage.\nNelson sent the introductory email to Colleen Koch, dean of the College of Medicine; Michael Perri, dean of the College of Public Health and Health Professions; and Stephen Sugrue, senior associate dean of research affairs. All would remain closely involved in shepherding Ladapo through the hiring process.\nAfter the Gainesville Sun began asking questions about Ladapo, Nelson sent his chief communications officer an email Sept. 20 recommending several talking points.\n\"Let\u2019s be transparent about timelines and events for his hire. Contacted by applicant and Governor\u2019s office for potential academic opportunities at UF,\" Nelson said, adding that they should talk up the \"enormous opportunity to partner a top 5 public, land grant university and health system with DOH and SG.\"\nA UF Health spokesman confirmed that the governor's office contacted UF.\n\"We did hear from the governor\u2019s office that Dr. Ladapo was under consideration for the state surgeon general position,\" UF Health spokesman Ken Garcia said, adding that Ladapo \"separately and independently reached out to us about a potential opportunity for employment at UF.\"\nBecause he was also being considered for a high-profile state position, Garcia said, it was \"not uncommon for leaders of the university to be informed about these matters.\"\nA request to the governor\u2019s office for emails and other records related to Ladapo\u2019s hiring has not yet been fulfilled a month after the request was made. A request for comment from the governor's office still is pending.\nBut it\u2019s clear from emails that Nelson expected the UF leaders to help Ladapo find a position \u2014 and to get it done posthaste.\n\u201cHe will need to identify a home Department (in the college) and then set up a Zoom talk for UF Health community along with some key interviews,\" Nelson wrote. \"I have also suggested a Gainesville visit in the near future. I would ask you each to set up a Zoom call with Joe and give him an overview of your college and potential home departments.\u201d\nIf that wasn't enough to stress the importance of fast-tracking Ladapo's hiring, Nelson added the following kicker: \u201cThere are some sensitivities regarding timing and would ask if you could expedite this communication.\u201d\nHe also asked Sugrue to discuss research opportunities with Ladapo, along with options to transfer his grants and subcontracts from University of California Los Angeles, where he had worked since 2016 and only recently received tenure there, to UF.\nNelson ended the email noting that \u201cJoe, Kent and Mori\u201d \u2014 referring to Glover, Fuchs, and Hosseini \u2014 were looped in and supportive.\nTwo weeks later, Ladapo had an offer letter to come to the university at a salary of $337,000, which included $75,000 in supplemental pay to run a program in the Senior Vice President of Health Affairs office \u2014 not the $262,000 that UF Health communications staff originally reported to the Gainesville Sun and the USA TODAY Network-Florida.\nA video of a Sept. 23 UF faculty senate hearing shows Glover and Fuchs denying any involvement in the hiring of Ladapo.\n\u201cI had no involvement with this at all,\u201d Glover said.\nFuchs told the senate members, \u201cMy understanding is there was no pressure on the dean, or the chair or the faculty.\u201d\nLadapo recruitment was fast-tracked\nAfter Nelson sent out that initial email, college administrators quickly scrambled to set up Zoom meetings with department chairs and chiefs, senior associate deans of research and faculty members to speak about their departments. They also bumped the scheduled speaker for Medical Grand Rounds so Ladapo could deliver a presentation to the medical college faculty.\nHe also had an interview with Nelson.\nLadapo \"was evaluated as we would any other candidate,\" Garcia said, adding that the entire process was conducted virtually, which is common during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWithin several days they found a place for him in the Department of Medicine's Division of Internal Medicine, using a notice for two assistant/associate professor and clinical positions that had an original open date of Dec.15, 2019.\nAll the other positions that were open since July were filled within a month or two.\n\"The position for which he applied ... is typically open for long periods of time to attract a robust candidate pool of different levels interested in a position with the UF College of Medicine,\" Garcia said.\nThe human resources manager sent the link to the vice chair for administration, who forwarded it to Jamie Conti, chair of the Department of Medicine, with the message: \"Here is the link to our open Internal Medicine faculty positions. The link should take you right there, but the unique job number is also referenced.\"\nConti had her administrative assistant send the link to Ladapo, who immediately sent out an email thanking everyone who had helped him:\n\"Colleen, Jamie, Mike, and Dave, It\u2019s been a pleasure making your acquaintance and I truly appreciate how supportive you\u2019ve been of me. I am excited about how things are progressing and really appreciative of your efforts. Jamie, thanks for arranging several meetings for me with other key individuals on this coming Monday.\"\nOn Sept. 13, an hour before Ladapo notified Conti that he filled out the application, Colleen Koch, dean of the College of Medicine, sent an email out to Nelson, Conti and various administrators regarding recruitment and HR, saying that Ladapo was relocating to Florida from UCLA.\n\"His academic home will be UF COM, Department of Medicine. Jamie Conti and her team are in the process of bringing him on board in the Division of Internal Medicine. Can you work with Dr. Conti\u2019s VC of Administration Rachel to move the process forward?\" she wrote.\n'Hold off on this for signature'\nBefore he received his first offer letter, there was some confusion over at Human Resources, emails show. Kevin Clark asked Koch about what exactly was supposed to go into the offer letter.\n\"I am not aware of any specifics. Do you know who would have the information regarding the specifics of the position which we are offering him? The only information Rachel was aware of is that he is to be offered full professor with tenure upon hire. She is not aware of duties or start date types of details,\" he wrote.\nKoch wrote back that Conti could provide details, and that Nelson wanted to review the offer letter before it went out.\nThe first draft offered Ladapo a base pay of $250,000 a year, or the 40th percentile of the base pay for a full professor of general internal medicine, with a starting date of Oct. 1. He was also given a workload of 90% research and 10% clinical.\nNelson intervened immediately: \"Hold off on this for signature. I need to talk with Colleen and Jamie tomorrow offline before we finalize offer and salary.\"\nTwo days later, Jeremy Sibiski, executive director of finance and administration for the College of Medicine, said he updated the letter to include $75,000 of supplemental pay for Ladapo to be director of clinical health equity under Nelson, and raised the base pay to $262,000 or the 50th percentile for a professor of general medicine.\nThat UF salary includes $150,000 from the state Department of Health to compensate for his time as surgeon general. The state also is paying Ladapo an additional $100,000 for a total of $437,000 a year.\nA day later, he adjusted the clinical ratio to 80% research and 20% clinical teaching.\nA final draft was approved and sent to Ladapo on Sept. 17. Ladapo emailed that he printed out the offer letter, and signed it with a modification of the start date \u2014 from Oct. 1 to Sept. 20 \u2014 \"as instructed.\"\nTo which Nelson replied to Conti, Koch and Wisinski: \"Thank you all so much! I will explain the date change when I see you in person.\"\nStart dates are often adjusted based on the needs of a new hire, Garcia said: \"In this instance, the start date was adjusted to coincide with Dr. Ladapo\u2019s appointment as Florida\u2019s surgeon general.\"\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "How much does Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo make? Compare other state workers here\nFlorida\u2019s new Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, got a pay raise when he accepted the job. Jobs, actually.\nLadapo will make $437,000 a year. Here's how that breaks down.\nThe University of Florida College of Medicine announced it would pay Ladapo a base salary per year of $262,000 as a professor of general internal medicine.\nAccording to the employee interchange contract between UF and the Department of Health for his services, provided under a public records request filed by the USA TODAY Network\u2013Florida, the DOH is contributing $150,000 a year to UF toward that salary.\nThe state also is paying an additional $100,000 a year directly to Ladapo, DOH spokeswoman Weesam Khoury said, which makes a total of $250,000 a year the DOH is paying for him. This amount is the most allowed for that position under raises for agency heads recently approved by the Florida Legislature.\nDeSantis megadonor: UF Board of Trustees chair supplied Ladapo's resume, fast-tracking surgeon general's hire\nRushing Ladapo into the job: Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show\nAnd it was revealed in recently released emails, Ladapo will receive an extra $75,000 that had not been previously disclosed for running a special projects group under Dr. David Nelson, senior vice president for health affairs at the University of Florida and president of UF Health.\nLadapo\u2019s salary marks a $198,000 bump over that of his more experienced predecessor, Scott Rivkees, during his tenure. It\u2019s also about $118,000 more than the $319,000 a year Ladapo made as a research professor at the University of California Los Angeles.\nWhat does Ladapo do? What does Florida's surgeon general actually do?\nFinding the facts: Fact-checking Florida Surgeon General Ladapo: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\nLadapo on meeting with Polsky: Under fire, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo says he can't communicate clearly while masked\nWhat do other Florida state employees make?\nThere are other state employees with employee interchange agreements but the amount that DOH is paying per year for Ladapo \u2013 with the bulk of that a contribution toward his UF salary \u2013 still puts him in the list of the top ten highest-paid Florida government employees, according to our state salary database.\n(This database doesn't account for portions of salaries that are paid out by foundations or other private entities, so some people may be bringing home more than this.)\nCurrently the highest-paid state government employee on salary, according to what has been reported by the state, would be Dr. Carolyn Drazinic, Chief of Medical Services, Department of Children and Families. She makes $326,683 a year, state records show.\nIf we look at the top ten salaries not counting Ladapo, four of them are officials with the Dept. of Children and Families. Five of them are Florida Supreme Court justices. And the other is Commissioner of Education Richard M. Corcoran, who receives $284,280.\nWhat do they make? See the salaries of Florida state employees in our salary database\nAnd they don't make as much as some of the hourly employees at the Department of Health.\nDr. Patricia J. Blanco, a pediatrician in Sarasota who is affiliated with Sarasota Memorial Hospital and Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, among others, makes $275 an hour from the DOH, which comes out to $572,000 a year.\nBrent W. Laartz, an infectious disease specialist in Safety Harbor, receives $210 an hour or $435,800 a year from the DOH,\nIn fact, there are 22 people in the DOH who are paid more than the top highest-paid government salaried people.\n2018 Database analysis: UF med faculty the highest-paid state workers\nBut for the real money, we have to look at state university positions. Daniel White, VP & athletic director at the University of Central Florida, has the highest annual state salary at $1,081,500. Paul H. Davis, Jr., head athletic coach at Florida International University, comes in right behind him at $1,041,863.\nDr. David R. Nelson, senior vice president for health affairs at the University of Florida and president of UF Health, brings in $1,033,946. Dr. Mark S. Bleiweis, director of the Congenital Heart Center along with multiple other positions at UF, receives $1,013,870.\nDaryoush Tavanaiepour, associate professor and chair of UF's neurosurgery department, makes $998.662.\nHow much does Florida Governor Ron DeSantis make?\nAccording to his most recent filing with the Florida Commission on Ethics, Gov.

      "text": "Dr. Joseph Ladapo confirmed as Florida surgeon general along party lines\nThe Doctor is in.\nThe Florida Senate today gave its seal of approval to Dr. Joseph Ladapo as the state's 6th Surgeon General, a vocal and controversial cheerleader for the pandemic policies of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis since picking him for the job five months ago.\nThose policies, however, are out of step with mainstream, conventional medical recommendations and federal policies.\nMore coverage from the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida:\n- Senate Democrats walk out as Republicans on panel OK Joseph Ladapo as Florida Surgeon General\n- Florida Department of Health rejects complaint against Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo\n- Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show\n- DeSantis mega-donor, UF Board of Trustees chair supplied Ladapo's resume, fast-tracking surgeon general's hire\n- COVID in Florida: Decoding the data behind state surgeon general's policies\n- Fact checking Florida Surgeon General Ladapo: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\nThe 24-15 vote along party lines to confirm Ladapo's nomination was a predictable but rocky path for the Harvard-educated, former UCLA research professor, who had full support of Republicans.\nSen. Aaron Bean, R-Fernandina Beach, said that tthe views Ladapo hold might have gotten him banned from social media. \"Maybe people are scared that we have a nominee that follows prescriptive norms that so many in national media have followed,\" Bean said.\nBut he said he met Ladapo and believes him to be a man of data: \u201cHe didn't just go to college. He went to Harvard. We have a national draft pick.\"\nSenate Democrats, however, raised several objections to his views on mask and vaccine mandates, the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and lockdowns. They walked out of the first hearing before the Health Policy Committee on his confirmation in protest over his rambling, non-direct responses to their questions.\nThe second hearing, before the Ethics and Elections Committee, was extended to give members time to ask all their questions.\n\"We extended time so everyone could ask every question of the candidate,\" said Sen. Dennis Baxley, Chairman of the Ethics and Elections Committee. \"That was a very long night. The report of the committee was made after this very extensive investigation.\"\nLadapo showed by his answers that \"he is not the right person for this job,\" Sen. Lori Berman, D-Delray Beach, said during debate. \"His answers were evasive at best and sometimes contemptuous when answering questions about masks, social distancing and vaccines.\"\nNoting that 68,900 Floridians have died from COVID-19, Berman said, \"thousands of our constituents have unnecessarily died because of the failure\" to follow the science.\nAnd Sen. Gary Farmer, D-Fort Lauderdale, added that Ladapo has \"espoused political rhetoric over science.\"\nDr. Joseph Ladapo succeeds Scott Rivkees as Florida surgeon general\nLadapo was nominated by DeSantis in late September after his first surgeon general, Scott Rivkees, stepped down after serving for more than two years, most of that time from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs state health director, Ladapo oversees the Department of Health, a $3 billion agency of more than 17,000 employees. The agency oversees Florida\u2019s 67 County Health Departments; 22 Children\u2019s Medical Services area offices; 12 Medical Quality Assurance regional offices; nine Disability Determinations regional offices; and three public health laboratories.\nIt also is responsible for numerous programs including epidemiology, immunization and communicable diseases, school health and health education, environmental health, emergency preparedness, eliminating health disparities, maintaining vital statistics, and the licensing and quality assurance of thousands of health professionals.\nThe day before the governor appointed surgeon general, Ladapo was hired by the University of Florida College of Medicine as a fully tenured research professor in a process that was fast-tracked and aided by Daytona Beach developer Mori Hosseini, the chairman of the UF Board of Trustees and a top advisor to the DeSantis campaign.\nUnder a special work contract with the state, Ladapo will spend 80% of his time as surgeon general, and 20% as a UF professor. His combined salary is $437,000 a year.\nFrom day one, Ladapo's comments and decisions have caused an outcry from Democrats who say he's not qualified for the job of running the state's massive Department of Health and setting health policy for millions of Floridians.\nUnlike his predecessor, who was largely kept out of public view after saying people would have to wear masks and practice social distancing for at least a year until a vaccine could be developed and approved, Ladapo has made several public appearances with DeSantis.\nWhen his appointment was first announced, Ladapo said, the state's policies would not be driven by federal policies of fear. \"Fear is done,\" he announced. He also said that policy decisions would be driven by data and science.\nLadapo also wasted no time following DeSantis's approach by doubling down on forbidding schools to require masks, and overturning school quarantine policies \u2014 giving parents the right to decide whether to pull their children out of class if they've been exposed to COVID-19.\nHe raised concerns about the efficacy of the vaccine and its side effects when other health professionals were urging as many people as possible to get vaccinated during the Omicron surge. Instead, he and DeSantis pushed for more monoclonal antibody treatments, even though some of them proved ineffective against the omicron variant.\nAnd he rewrote state testing policy, recommending that only those with serious symptoms get tested and asymptomatic people need not bother. He also refuses to disclose whether he's been vaccinated.\nLadapo also received flak for the Department of Health's decision to place Dr. Raul Pino, the Orange County Health Department chief, on administrative leave after urging his staff to get vaccinated when he discovered the department's low vaccination rate.\nAnd during his Senate background check conducted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, a former supervisor said they could not recommend Ladapo for the position.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the people of Florida would be better served by a Surgeon General who grounds his policy decisions and recommendations on the best scientific evidence rather than opinions,\u201d said the supervisor, whom the FDLE did not name in its report to the Senate.\nHe generated headlines when he unapologetically refused to wear a mask at the office of State Sen. Tina Polsky, who told him she had a serious illness that she later disclosed to be breast cancer. That incident drew the attention of President Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, who publicly rebuked Ladapo for disrespecting a Senate colleague and being \"unprofessional.\"\nPolsky, who had a chance to grill Ladapo extensively, said he is clearly a political appointee who has no plan for the pandemic or any other health crisis the state is facing.\nBean characterized the incident as a \"lapse of judgment or bedside manner.\"\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "Florida pediatricians concerned and 'exhausted' as kids' vaccination rate drops\nSince the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy over the mRNA 'jab' spread to other vaccines, and one pediatrician says Florida is 'just one step away from another outbreak.'\nThe vaccination rate of Florida kindergarteners has fallen to 90.6%, the lowest in over a decade, and concerned pediatricians say they are exhausted trying to combat anti-vax information \u2013 including from the state government.\n\u201cIt's gotten difficult to manage,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Gwynn, a Miami pediatrician and medical director for a mobile clinic that serves uninsured children.\nNearly 91% may seem high, but for highly contagious diseases like measles, for example, public health experts recommend a vaccination rate of at least 95%. Lower than that increases the risk of outbreaks of diseases that are otherwise preventable. That's especially a problem in schools, where children are in close contact with each other.\n\"Kids aren't getting the protection they need. We're just one step away from another outbreak,\" Gwynn said. \u201cThe data is very clear. Vaccines are safe and effective, but we're up against this polarization right now. It's difficult; it's hard to do the work that we've been trained to do.\u201d\nThe kindergarten vaccination rate does not just affect children, she added, but also adults with immunodeficiencies, people undergoing chemotherapy and other \u201cvulnerable members of our society.\u201d\nWhat's behind the decrease in vaccinations in Florida?\nIn Florida, a religious exemption is all that\u2019s needed to avoid immunizations for diseases like measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), pertussis (whooping cough) and varicella (chicken pox).\nAccording to a Florida Department of Health report for July 2024, the proportion of children 5-17 with new religious exemptions are increasing each month. St. John\u2019s, Flagler, Sarasota and Walton counties have the highest number of children with religious exemptions, according to that data.\nSince the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy over the mRNA \u201cjab\u201d spread to other vaccines, pediatricians say, who add that it\u2019s becoming difficult to practice in the state. Some refuse to take unvaccinated patients, and the ones that do accept them don\u2019t have the capacity.\nGwynn, the past president of Florida's chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, has seen an increase in unvaccinated patients in the past 20 years \u2014 first with the wave of misinformation from fraudulent research about how MMR vaccines cause autism, and now with COVID-19 vaccines.\nDr. Jeff Goldhagen, professor and chief of the Division of Community and Societal Pediatrics at the University of Florida, said the rise of unvaccinated children has multiple reasons, but points to the state\u2019s own messaging about mRNA vaccines as \u201cthe most perverse.\u201d\n\u201cIt's an issue across the country, but it's a pertinent issue, a particular issue in Florida, because of the policies of our governor and our surgeon general,\u201d said Goldhagen, who was also the previous director of the Duval County Health Department for 13 years.\nDOH's safety concerns about mRNA vaccines 'deceptive'\nIn Florida, the state\u2019s own surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has been an outspoken critic of COVID-19 vaccines and has tried to win over vaccine skeptics by appearing on right-wing and conspiracy theory-promoting talk shows.\nIn January of this year, Ladapo called for a halt of all COVID-19 mRNA vaccines: \u201cThe American people and the scientific community have a right to have all relevant information pertaining to the COVID-19 vaccines to properly inform individual decision making,\u201d Ladapo wrote to the heads of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nOn Thursday evening, DOH issued guidance that advises against the latest COVID-19 booster. Its press release alleges \"the federal government has failed to provide sufficient data to support the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 boosters.\"\nIn a section called \"Safety and Efficacy Concerns,\" the health department lists seven bullet points of issues with the mRNA vaccine. \"Based on the high rate of global immunity and currently available data, the State Surgeon General advises against the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\"\nGoldhagen says DOH's report is deceptive, and many of its issues aren't scientifically-based.\nFor example, the department lists the risks of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, from the COVID-19 vaccine as an example of a safety and efficacy concern. But Goldhagen says the risk is far greater from a COVID infection than getting it from the vaccine.\nAnother example DOH includes, DNA integration, has been debunked, Goldhagen said. \"You have a better chance of becoming Spider-Man\u201d than being harmed by DNA from the COVID vaccines, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who serves on an FDA advisory committee for the COVID vaccines, in a Scientific American article.\nMore: Despite FDA recommendations Florida Surgeon General Ladapo warns against new COVID booster\nGoldhagen said Ladapo is \"absolutely wrong\" when they say the new booster doesn't provide protection among circulating variants. According to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Yale Medicine, all say the new booster protects against the latest variants.\n\"This is beyond infuriating,\" he said. \"Ladapo is playing on people's fears.\"\nAre parents' rights a public health issue? DeSantis says yes\nGoldhagen said the latest press release sends a message, and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are the \u201ctip of the iceberg.\u201d\nThe last time the vaccination rate dipped below 90% was in 2009 when it was 89.8%. A recent WalletHub report lists Florida\u2019s vaccination rates among the lowest, at 46 among U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\nIn Florida, to obtain a religious exemption, Gwynn said parents used to have to consult with a nurse at the department of health about the risks of not getting children vaccinated.\nBut not anymore.\nGoldhagen and other physicians have said families are moving to the state in part because of how easy it is to obtain a religious exemption to vaccines. To obtain an exemption for school-entry health examinations and immunizations against communicable diseases, Florida law says the parent of the child can object in writing that a vaccine \u201cconflicts with his or her religious tenets or practices.\u201d\nBut Gov. Ron DeSantis has labeled the decision of vaccination as a parents\u2019 rights issue, a point of view that has been at the forefront of not only his public health agenda but also education.\nWhen hospitalizations of children soared during the delta wave of 2021, he implemented the Parents Bill of Rights and banned mask mandates in schools. Later, he banned vaccine requirements for businesses as well.\nThis year, after a measles outbreak at a school in South Florida, the state did not follow the CDC\u2019s recommendations that students should remain at home to quarantine and left the decision up to parents on whether to send their children to school.\n\u201cOnce again, Florida has shown that good public health policy includes personal responsibility and parents' rights,\u201d DeSantis said in a press release. \u201cWhile the national medical health establishment and media have lost the public\u2019s confidence, Florida continues to restore sanity and reason to public health, and will always do so under my leadership.\u201d\nVaccine availability in Florida\nIn the July 2024 Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance Report, the state recorded 66 whooping cough infections, a steep increase from the previous month. The 66 infections were also above the previous five-year average. Most of those infections were in infants under 1.\nWhile Hepatitis A, meningitis and chicken pox were below the previous five-year averages, the disease rate for meningitis and incidence rate for chicken pox were the highest among infants under 1.\nIn the report, on the first page and in bold, DOH says: \u201cUnvaccinated children are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases like mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), and varicella. Communities with a higher proportion of religious exemptions (REs) to vaccination are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable disease transmission.\u201d\nThe state does provide free vaccinations through county departments and its Florida Vaccines for Children Program, including immunizations for MMR, chicken pox, polio, tetanus, human papillomavirus (HPV) and the flu.\nDOH, however, does not provide COVID-19 vaccines at the county health departments \u201cdue to the widely available supply in communities,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nIn Florida, children over 3 can get a COVID-19 vaccine at Walgreens. CVS Pharmacy can vaccinate children age 5 and over for COVID-19, and the company\u2019s MinuteClinics can vaccinate children 18 months and older.\nPhysicians can order COVID-19 vaccines through the Florida SHOTS system, which is overseen by DOH, but shipments of vaccines are not sent to DOH before being sent to doctors\u2019 offices. Vials are sent directly from the manufacturer to the physician\u2019s practice.\nGwynn said she has ordered the new COVID-19 immunizations for children 6 months and older for her mobile clinic through Florida SHOTS. While the numbers of hospitalizations aren\u2019t as high as the delta wave, children are still becoming seriously ill because of the latest COVID variants, she said.\n\u201cIt's not just about the individual child, but it's also about family members and also their classmates within the classroom, and then it's the community at large. I think we've gotten away from that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the pandemic didn't teach us the importance of all being together on this topic, then I'm not sure how we're going to get back to that.\u201d\nAna Go\u00f1i-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida, can be reached at agonilessan@gannett.com."

      "text": "Doctors rip basis of Florida Surgeon General Ladapo's latest anti-COVID vaccine advice\nFlorida\u2019s top health official, who touts unproven COVID-19 treatments, is once again urging a large group of people to skip vaccination, drawing rebuke from doctors who point out his recommendation lacks evidence.\nFlorida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo wants men younger than 40 to avoid the Moderna and Pfizer shots, he said Friday in a statement. Ladapo cited an \u201canalysis\u201d done by unnamed authors from the state Health Department, claiming those men faced higher risks of dying from heart problems after inoculation.\n\u201cThe benefit of vaccination is likely outweighed by this abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men in this age group,\u201d the Health Department said Friday.\nLadapo before Congress: Florida surgeon general defends opposition to COVID-19 vaccines for children before Congress\nCOVID in Florida: Down again: COVID numbers continue to decline in Florida\nNot all good news: Florida leads nation in COVID deaths for third month in a row\nDoctors and scientists, as well as the federal government, have since called out Ladapo\u2019s advice, saying the \u201canalysis\u201d it\u2019s based on does not support his conclusion. Florida is the only state that recommends against vaccinating men ages 18 to 39.\n\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible for a state health agency to put out something like that,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University.\nFlorida\u2019s eight-page \u201canalysis\u201d does not name its authors, their fields of expertise or their experience. It examined just 20 deaths among men in that age group within four weeks of inoculation.\nThe state Health Department ignored requests from The Palm Beach Post to provide details on its report, including who conducted the \u201canalysis\u201d and their professional backgrounds. The governor's office also did not return requests for comment.\nWhoever wrote the report said in it that they cannot confirm the underlying cause of those deaths. They could not verify whether anyone they analyzed was infected with COVID. The Health Department also did not compare cardiac death rates among vaccinated younger men to those infected by the respiratory disease.\n\u201cIf that were submitted to a journal, that would be rejected promptly,\u201d Salmon said.\nUsing only death certificates can be misleading, doctor says\nAnother flaw in the state\u2019s reporting \u2014 it examined only death certificates. Epidemiologists say those often list cardiac arrest because other diseases cause the heart to stop. Former Palm Beach County Medical Society President Dr. Larry Bush called the state\u2019s examination \u201ca misinterpretation of death certificates.\u201d\nCardiac arrest is often listed on death certificates, Bush said. \u201cIt's the most common pathway to death.\u201d\nA death certificate, Bush said, \u201cis really not relevant except in situations like this where people are trying to use it for misinformation or legal situations.\u201d\nLadapo claimed in his Friday statement that men younger than 40 faced an \u201c84% increase\u201d in cardiac-related death within four weeks of mRNA vaccination. He repeated that claim Monday on Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson show.\nOver the weekend, Twitter removed Ladapo\u2019s statement for spreading COVID misinformation before restoring it.\nUniversity of South Florida epidemiologist Dr. Jason Salemi criticized the state Health Department\u2019s report for not comparing the risks of vaccination to its benefits. He also noted that department staff could have analyzed the men\u2019s medical records to see if the causes of death listed there lined up with the death certificates in the state\u2019s report.\n\u201cConsidering the relatively small sample size, even a modest amount of misclassification of the cause of death could have meaningful implications for the study\u2019s findings,\u201d Salemi said in an email.\nSalemi noted that more than 940 COVID deaths among men under 40 were logged during the time frame the Health Department said it examined, Dec. 15, 2020, to June 1 this year.\n\u201cKnowing the quality of work that has come from epidemiologists and other scientists at the state Department of Health, I would have fully expected these other issues to be addressed in their analyses,\u201d Salemi said. \u201cWere these assessments really not done, or were they for some reason just not provided with what was shared publicly?\u201d\nRisk of heart inflammation alleged\nLadapo tried defending his advice Monday. \u201cIs it really that hard to imagine that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that increase myocarditis in young men by 10x, 20x, or 30x \u2026 also increase the risk of cardiac death in that age group?\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nThe \u201canalysis\u201d he cited did not mention myocarditis, known also as heart inflammation. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about something that's really really really rare,\u201d Salmon said.\nOut of all age and gender groups, boys ages 12 to 17 may be most likely to develop heart inflammation post-vaccine, according to a December study by a team of scientists led by Dr. Anders Husby of Statens Serum Institut in Denmark. The rate was low, between 1 in 2,500 boys to 1 in 10,000, researchers found.\nFederal health officials have also blasted Ladapo\u2019s recommendation.\n\u201cThis decision is flawed and a far cry from the science: COVID-19 vaccines have been proven safe and effective, and severe adverse reactions are rare,\u201d U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Sarah Lovenheim told The Orlando Sentinel on Monday. \u201cVaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials and since then, tens of millions of Americans have received COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\nAbout 14.6% of Floridian men younger than 50 have gotten at least one booster shot, the 17th lowest of all states, CDC data shows. About 60% have gotten the initial Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, or the one-shot Johnson & Johnson dose.\nJoseph Ladapo's history of anti-vaccine messaging\nLadapo has a history of pushing anti-vaccine views.\nIn June, he advised against inoculating children younger than 5, saying the risks outweighed benefits. Florida was the only state to block pediatricians this past summer from preordering COVID shots for children, infuriating parents statewide.\nIn March, he advised against vaccinating children ages 5 to 17. Florida is the only state that recommends not vaccinating children against COVID.\nBefore Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him as Florida\u2019s top health official, Ladapo touted unproven treatments against COVID. He wrote in support of an anti-parasitic livestock medicine Ivermectin in November 2020 in The Wall Street Journal.\nThe University of Florida fast-tracked Ladapo\u2019s hiring, knowing that DeSantis was eyeing him in 2021 to replace outgoing predecessor Scott Rivkees, The Tallahassee Democrat reported last year. He had the backing of UF leaders, including major Republican donor and DeSantis supporter Mori Hosseini, Board of Trustees chairman.\nA former supervisor of Ladapo\u2019s from the University of California in Los Angeles declined to endorse him for the job, a state background check revealed. \u201cIn my opinion the people of Florida would be better served by a surgeon general who grounds his policy decisions and recommendations in the best scientific evidence rather than opinions,\u201d the unnamed ex-boss said.\nDeSantis\u2019 core constituency has refused inoculation.\nJust 13% of Republicans nationwide said in a September survey by healthcare research group The Kaiser Family Foundation that they plan to get, or have gotten, the latest coronavirus booster shots designed to fight the pathogen\u2019s omicron variant mutations. About 32% of all adults surveyed said same.\nStates, including Florida, have counted 203 COVID deaths among adults ages 18 to 29 as of July, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Unvaccinated deaths in that age group total 2,527.\nAmong COVID victims ages 30 to 49, states have counted 2,177 vaccinated victims and 21,235 unvaccinated fatalities.\nThe data does not break deaths down by gender. The Florida Department of Health could release state-specific numbers on deaths by vaccination status but chooses not to.\n\u201cClearly the vaccines made a difference,\u201d Bush, the Palm Beach County infectious disease specialist, said. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t want to believe that, then the earth is flat.\u201d\nChris Persaud is The Palm Beach Post's data reporter.

      "text": "Ladapo's COVID guidance termed 'highly questionable' by University of Florida colleagues\nTALLAHASSEE \u2013 Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo\u2019s controversial guidance discouraging COVID-19 vaccines for younger men is of \u201chighly questionable merit,\u201d a task force of University of Florida medical school doctors has concluded.\nThe task force critique by his own colleagues at UF found that Ladapo committed \u201creporting bias by cherry picking results; focusing only on evidence that supports his stance, ignoring contradicting evidence and failing to appropriately acknowledge the limitations of his own data set.\u201d\nThe panel also said Ladapo's research is flawed because it \"forms conclusions on the basis of exceptionally small event rates that distort magnitude of risk and do not consider magnitude of benefit.\"\nLadapo in October issued Florida Health Department guidance advising males age 18 through 39 to avoid COVID-19 mRNA vaccines \u2013 commonly the widely-used Pfizer and Moderna shots.\nThe Health Department published its own analysis showing what it called an increase \u201cin the relative incidence of cardiac-related death\u201d among males in that age group, about a month after they\u2019d received the vaccine.\nLadapo, who is on the faculty at the University of Florida College of Medicine, is an appointee of Gov. Ron DeSantis and an outspoken vaccine skeptic. The faculty critique was first reported by the Washington Post.\nJae Williams, a Health Department spokesman, said that Ladapo stands by the guidance. He also said the UF panel appeared out to \"vilify their colleague's work by gaining national media attention when their stated purpose is to 'promote the advancement of medicine... by promoting mutual fellowship and good feeling among the faculty.\"\nThe panel said that Ladapo conducted \u201ccareless, irregular or contentious research practices,\u201d and recommended that his actions be reviewed by UF\u2019s research integrity office.\nBackground: When first appointed...Dr. Joseph Ladapo: What we know about Florida's Surgeon General\n'It\u2019s irresponsible': Doctors rip basis of Florida Surgeon General Ladapo's latest anti-COVID vaccine advice\nReady to talk...to skeptics: Florida Surgeon General Ladapo appears on anti-vaccine podcast, promotes medical falsehoods\nWhere DeSantis is leading....Florida Supreme Court approves DeSantis call for coronavirus vaccine grand jury\nNo further action expected from UF\nBut in a statement, David Norton, UF\u2019s vice president for research, said Wednesday that the research integrity office has \u201cno standing\u201d to look into the committee\u2019s accusations because Ladapo issued the guidance as a state official, not a faculty member.\nEven before he was named Florida\u2019s top doctor in 2021, Ladapo was outspoken on COVID-19, mostly by way of downplaying the benefits of mask-wearing, openly condemning business and school lockdowns, and signing onto the Great Barrington Declaration.\nThe declaration, signed by prominent researchers who cast doubts on vaccines or social precautions, advanced the concept of herd immunity \u2013 sickening a large enough segment of the population \u2013 as a way to emerge from the pandemic.\nDeSantis continues to rely on a few of the Great Barrington leaders in COVID-19 roundtables, the most recent one held just last month.\nAlmost 84,000 Floridians have died from COVID-19. More than 7.2 million have been sickened by the virus, with an average 3,040 cases per day reported last week.\nCDC: Vaccines effective and safe\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says COVID-19 vaccines are effective and that their use remains the safest strategy at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized and dying.\nAbout 69% of Florida\u2019s population is considered fully vaccinated, although a much smaller percentage have kept up on booster shots.\nEven so, DeSantis just before Christmas got the Florida Supreme Court to endorse his request to establish a statewide grand jury that will investigate what he called \u201ccrimes and wrongdoing committed against Floridians related to the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\nDeSantis has appointed a majority of the seven-member court, so the decision to comply with the governor\u2019s request wasn\u2019t a surprise.\nThe Republican governor, just sworn in for a second term Tuesday, is widely seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024. He is clearly siding with those who\u2019ve promoted vaccine suspicions and conspiracies, saying that with the grand jury investigation \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to get more information and bring legal accountability for those who committed misconduct.\u201d\nDeSantis\u2019 focus includes companies that manufacture vaccines and the recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He also has endorsed the view of skeptics who accuse vaccine manufacturers of withholding data regarding links between vaccines and heart problems.\nMore DeSantis distance from Trump?\nThe hurry-up development and initial distribution of the COVID-19 vaccinations were a signature accomplishment of former President Trump\u2019s administration. Trump in many opinion polls among Republican voters remains a favorite for the 2024 presidential nomination, which DeSantis now also is expected to seek.\nThe attack on vaccines is another potential point of separation between DeSantis and Trump, formerly allies now more frequently at odds.\nLadapo has a deep bond with critics of COVID-19 vaccines. He appeared in the fall on a podcast of an Ohio doctor who perpetuates the claim that vaccines cause autism.\nLast month, he was the guest speaker at a Miami dinner hosted by the Brownstown Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank that maintains policy responses to the pandemic are a \u201cfailed experiment in full social and economic control.\u201d\nAt the dinner, Ladapo was photographed with Dr. Paul Alexander, a Brownstone Fellow.

      "text": "Fact checking Florida Surgeon General Ladapo: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\nIn case there was any doubt, Florida\u2019s new surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo made his views crystal clear this week about vaccine mandates, school mask policies, the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, and efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\"What we are talking about here today is really an example of just extreme policies that we've seen during this pandemic, and policies that have been implemented without thinking about whether they make sense or thinking about their risks and benefits and what the implications of those policies are,\" Ladapo said.\nClearly, Ladapo, like his boss Gov. Ron DeSantis, is bucking the established thinking. Just how much is in evidence below as we compare and contrast his comments with accepted policy and guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nMore on the new surgeon general:\n- Weaponized surgeon general? Ladapo comes out swinging on social media, at DeSantis' side\n- Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo asked to leave meeting after refusing to wear mask\n- Joe Ladapo, Florida's new surgeon general, receives 52% raise over his predecessor\nCritics say Ladapo is spreading misinformation that contributes to vaccine hesitancy. Florida's vaccination rate is ranked 21st among all 50 states and Washington, D.C., at 59% fully vaccinated, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\"We are in the middle of an extremely deadly pandemic, and more people have died of this disease in 2021 than in 2020. It is absurd to see public leaders not following CDC guidelines and science,\" said Dr. Leo Nissola, Chief Scientific Officer of FirstBio Research, scientific research and counsel firm based in San Francisco who also worked on COVID-19 epidemiological models presented in White House Press briefings.\nOn the day his appointment was announced on Sept. 21, Ladapo promised he would base his decisions on science and fact. Here are some of his comments from Thursday's rally and what the CDC and other health sources have to say.\nFact 1. Vaccine efficacy\n\u201cRemember when people were telling you that these vaccines would stop transmission and the rate of protection was greater than 90%? Ten months later we\u2019re finding that the rate of protection is less than 40% than some of them. This idea that we are foolish for not believing things we don't have data for is ridiculous. People need to stick to their intuition and sensibilities.\u201d\nThe Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were all rigorously tested before the FDA gave emergency use authorization last November. Pfizer and Moderna, which are mRNA vaccines, were found to be 85% effective against infection and 95% effective against hospitalization or death, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was found to be 65% effective against infection and 85% against hospitalization or death, the CDC said.\nPreliminary reports show the efficacy of the vaccines has waned somewhat against the more rapidly transmissible Delta variant, according to Healthline, an online health information company. Moderna is 50% to 95% effective against Delta, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 39% to 96 % effective against Delta, but real world data shows they still provide 60% to 95% protection against hospitalization.\nTwo outliers appear to be Qatar and Israel.\nA Qatar study recorded a drop to about 60%, but the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness for hospitalization and severe illness remained around 90%.\nIsraeli data showed that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine\u2019s effectiveness against infection dipped to as low as 39% between June and July, down from the previous 64%, Healthline reported.\nFact 2: Breakthrough infections\n\u201cThe infections will happen whether people are vaccinated or not. That\u2019s obvious.\" First, experts said breakthrough infections were rare, he said, but that isn\u2019t the case. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously not rare. They\u2019re common, that's the truth.\u201d\nNot according to the CDC, Johns Hopkins and recent medical research.\nBreakthrough cases are very rare, according to a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine. It published a study of breakthroughs among a group of healthcare workers at the largest hospital in Israel. Of the 1,497 vaccinated workers tested, only 2.6% were positive for COVID-19, far lower than the rate for the entire country.\nA Washington state study of 4 million fully vaccinated people showed that 1 in 5,000 had a breakthrough infection between Jan. 17 and Aug. 21, Johns Hopkins reported.\nSome populations have shown breakthroughs of 1 in 100 fully vaccinated people, or 1%.\nWhile the vaccines are not 100% effective against the COVID virus, and the Delta variant in particular, they are still very effective at keeping you from getting a serious infection that could put you in the hospital on a ventilator or even kill you, Johns Hopkins said.\nOverall, the CDC reported more than 189 million people in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated as of Oct. 18, and during the same time saw only 41,127 patients from the 50 U.S. states and territories with COVID breakthrough infections hospitalized or died.\nPeople with weakened immune systems caused by specific medical conditions or treatment for things like HIV and cancer are more likely to have a breakthrough infection, the CDC and other health organizations have said.\nFact 3: Vaccine mandates\n\"What is the data, what is the science behind these vaccine mandates. Well, as we know these vaccines are not preventing transmission. Sure, they reduce the likelihood of preventing it, but even that is questionable depending on how far out you go, but they are not preventing it.\"\nScientists and doctors maintain that vaccine hesitancy and refusal to partake have prolonged the pandemic. They argue that mandates can save countless lives.\nAnd the companies that have imposed vaccine mandates -- United Airlines Tyson Foods, the NBA and others -- are seeing compliance reaching 90% or better among their employees.\n\"Evidence suggests the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program has substantially reduced the burden of disease in the United States by preventing serious illness in fully vaccinated people and interrupting chains of transmission,\" the CDC said.\nWhile it's true that vaccinated people can carry the virus, studies show they spread less of the virus than unvaccinated people, which can help to break the chain of transmission.\nThe first study of transmission rates among vaccinated people who got a breakthrough infection was conducted by the University of Oxford, as reported in Nature.\nScientists examined 140,000 contacts of 96,000 people who had a breakthrough infection after they got vaccinated found that vaccinated people were less likely to pass COVID onto their friends than unvaccinated people.\nFact 4: Natural immunity\n\u201cWhy are some people not comfortable with these vaccines? Part of the reason is the climate of scientific dishonesty about the science, whether it\u2019s natural immunity, and denial of that in face of data, or the safety of the vaccines, there is dishonesty about that.\u201d\nA growing body of evidence suggests that natural immunity exists against COVID-19, but natural immunity plus vaccination provides even stronger protection, a recent USA TODAY report said. But it remains unclear how much protection it provides and how long it will last.\nMore: Natural immunity is good. Getting vaccinated after being sick with COVID-19 is better.\nThe CDC recommends that people who have had COVID get vaccinated anyway.\nThis creates what's called hybrid immunity, Warner Greene, a virologist at the Gladstone Institute in San Francisco told USA TODAY. A new study in the journal Science said that protection may last a long time, even longer than the vaccine alone, Greene said.\nOne expert tended to agree with Ladapo that health officials shouldn't downplay natural immunity.\n\"To deny natural immunity does not generate trust,\" Dr. Monica Gandhi of the University of California, San Francisco told USA TODAY.\nFact 5. Pregnant people\n\u201cYou hear these stories. People telling you what\u2019s been happening in their lives. Nurses, pregnant women are sort of being forced to put something in their bodies we don't know all there is to know about yet no matter what people on TV tell you. It\u2019s just not true. We are going to learn more about the truth of these vaccines.\"\nThe vaccine is highly recommended for pregnant and lactating women as well as those trying to get pregnant, the CDC said. Symptomatic pregnant people who contract COVID-19 are more at risk of severe illness, complications and death than those who are not pregnant, Johns Hopkins University reported.\n\u201cThere isn't doubt about the risk-benefit ratio,\u201d Nissola said.\nSome common misconceptions are that the vaccine isn't safe for those who are pregnant, that it can cross the placenta into the fetus, can cause infertility or change a woman's menstrual cycle \u2014 all untrue, according to a University of Utah Health website.\n\u201cPreliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Nissola said. \u201cHowever, like any new drug and medicine, more long-term follow-up is needed.\u201d\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "Long COVID: More than 1 in 4 Floridians with COVID developed lasting symptoms, survey says\nMore than 1 out of every 4 people in Florida who reported a positive COVID test developed lasting COVID symptoms, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nAccording to the latest Household Pulse Survey from the Census, covering the last two weeks in October 2023, nearly 3 million Floridians reported COVID-19 symptoms that lasted three months or longer. That's 27.6% of the people aged 18 and older in the state who received a positive COVID test or diagnosis from a healthcare provider, the report says.\nAnyone infected with COVID-19 can develop long COVID with lingering, long-term effects \u2014 fatigue, shortness of breath, coughs, headaches, difficulty thinking clearly and more \u2014 and they range from mild to debilitating. Symptoms can last for weeks, months or years. Long COVID is more common in people who had severe cases of COVID, people with underlying health conditions and people who have had COVID multiple times, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nAs of last year Florida no longer breaks out the numbers of people getting booster shots. In the last weekly situation report the Florida Department of Health issued in October, 72% of the state population was listed as having been vaccinated but only about a quarter of them had received at least one booster shot since. According to the New York Times, only about 12% of Floridians have received the booster that protects against the latest, highly transmissible variants.\nFlorida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo has argued against widespread vaccination and boosters, recommending against healthy children getting vaccinated and against anyone under the age of 65 getting boosters. In January, he called for a halt of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.\nAs of Feb. 9, over 8 million people in Florida have reported positive COVID cases, according to the Florida Department of Health, putting us third in the nation behind California and Texas. That's almost certainly lower than the actual number, as fewer cases were reported by healthcare providers or county health departments once people started testing at home. Over 94,000 Floridians have died from COVID.\nHow to protect yourself: Following national trends, Florida is seeing a spike in COVID driven by JN.1 variant\nWhat is long COVID?\nMost people who get infected with COVID-49 recover after a few days or weeks.\n\"Long COVID\" is the term used to describe a wide range of COVID symptoms that seem to never go away, or resurface after a period of apparent health. Sometimes symptoms can appear weeks later for people who didn't have any symptoms when they first caught it. It's also called post-acute COVID-19, or long-haul COVID, and it can ruin lives.\nWhat is long COVID doing to Floridians?\nAbout half of the people who reported COVID-19 symptoms lasting three months or longer did not respond to questions in the survey about long-term symptoms that reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. Of the ones who did:\n- Vision: 309,078 people reported some difficulty. 59,938 of those reported a lot of difficulty.\n- Hearing: 158,761 people reported some difficulty. 9,242 of them reported a lot of difficulty.\n- Remembering or concentrating: 462,942 people reported some difficulty. 149,845 of them reported a lot of difficulty. 40,553 said they couldn't do it at all.\n- Walking or climbing stairs: 332,344 people reported some difficulty. 5,834 of them reported a lot of difficulty. 5,417 people said they couldn't do it at all.\n- Self-care: 100,877 people reported some difficulty. 56,569 of them reported a lot of difficulty.\n- Understanding or being understood: 119,617 reported some difficulty. 28,076 of them reported a lot of difficulty\nAs of Oct. 30, 2023, 947,922 of the people who reported COVID symptoms lasting three months or more said they still had them, while over 8 million said they did not.\n'I knew I wasn't right.': How long COVID inflicted pain, trauma to Stuart woman\nWhat are the symptoms of long COVID?\nLong COVID can have a wide range of symptoms and may affect everyone differently. In a study funded by the National Institutes of Health, researchers identified symptoms that are the most distinctive to long COVID, including: fatigue, especially after exercise; brain fog; dizziness; gastrointestinal symptoms; heart palpitations; issues with sexual desire or capacity; loss of smell or taste; thirst; chronic cough; chest pain; and abnormal movements.\nAccording to the CDC, symptoms from long COVID can appear similar to \"myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and other poorly understood chronic illnesses\" and may be difficult to understand and manage.\nDisability denied: Unable to work, COVID long haulers face barriers to benefits\nCan I get tested for long COVID?\nThere isn't a test for long COVID, according to the CDC, as it isn't just one illness. Talk to your healthcare provider about any lingering symptoms, and if you've developed new or aggravated health issues make sure they know if you've previously had COVID in case it helps with diagnosis.\nLong COVID is diagnosed based on your health history and current examination, along with your COVID history.\nHow does Florida compare to other states?\nWe're not the worst. Oklahoma and Montana have the highest percentages of adults, about 34%, who tested positive for COVID-19 and have experienced symptoms lasting longer than three months according to the report. Georgia (31.7%), Arkansas (30.8%), Ohio (30%), North and South Dakota (about 30%), Wyoming (29.7%), West Virginia (29.4%), Indiana (28.7%), and Kentucky (28.5%) all had higher percentages, and Arizona tied with Florida (27.6%).\nWhere did the U.S. Census Bureau get these numbers?\nThe numbers are based on a survey sent to 1,054,612 households across the U.S. as a systemic sample.\n\"The HPS is designed to provide near real-time data on how the pandemic has affected people\u2019s lives,\" the Census said.\nSara Chernikoff and Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY, contributed to this story."

      "text": "Gov. Ron DeSantis will sign bill that bans adding fluoride to Florida's drinking water\nOn Tuesday in Miami, Gov. Ron DeSantis said he'll sign the \"Florida Farm Bill\" (SB 700), which preempts local municipalities from adding fluoride to their water.\n- The decision follows similar action in Utah and contradicts recommendations from the American Dental Association and the CDC.\n- Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo supports the ban, citing concerns about potential negative health effects of fluoride, while the Florida Dental Association disputes these claims.\nAs of July 1, it'll be against the law to fluoridate water in Florida.\nOn May 6 in Miami, Gov. Ron DeSantis, accompanied by Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, said he's signing the \"Florida Farm Bill\" (SB 700), which prevents local municipalities from adding fluoride to their water.\nThe legislation also does other things like add consumer protections and establish the Florida Aquaculture Foundation, but the removal of fluoride from local water supplies is what has gotten the most attention.\nFluoride helps prevent tooth decay by strengthening enamel, the hard outer layer of teeth, making it more resistant to acid from bacteria and sugary foods. Dental and health care experts say taking it out of the public water supply could lead to an increase in dental problems, such as cavities, which could affect poorer, often rural populations without dental insurance or otherwise limited in access to dental care.\nBut during his press conference, behind a sign that said \"Free State of Florida,\" DeSantis said: \"It's forced medication when they're jamming fluoride into your water supply.\"\nThe bill itself doesn't explicitly mention fluoride, but rather bans certain additives in the water system.\nDeSantis spent time blasting former chief medical adviser to the United States Anthony Fauci and the Covid-19 vaccine before talking about \"studies that have raised concerns about physical and mental health risks that have been associated with over exposure to fluoride.\"\nEarlier in the day, Miami-Dade County commissioners also voted to override Mayor Daniella Levine Cava's veto and proceed with plans to remove fluoride from the county's water supply.\n\"I think they voted the right way, so thank you,\" DeSantis said. \"For the counties that voted the other way, the legislation that we'll sign is going to answer that question.\"\nThe legislative move to nix fluoride additive from Florida's drinking water isn't a surprise, as Ladapo, who heads the Florida Department of Health, has backed arguments the American Dental Association call \"dangerous.\" Bill supporters maintain fluoride is naturally occurring in water sources and adding more is unnecessary.\nIn November, Ladapo told communities to stop fluoridating their drinking water, citing concerns over fluoride causing \"adverse effects in children reducing IQ, cognitive impairment, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\"\nBut the Florida Dental Association issued a statement saying Ladapo's guidance against fluoride was \"based on flawed and unscientific reports\" and said it continues to \"support ... community water fluoridation as an effective tool in reducing dental decay.\"\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called community water fluoridation one of the 10 greatest public health achievements in the 20th century.\nEarlier this year, Utah became the first state to ban fluoride. Florida soon will become the second.\nThis story has been updated.\nAna Go\u00f1i-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida, can be reached at agonilessan@gannett.com."

      "text": "Florida pro-abortion amendment group files First Amendment lawsuit as state targets ads\nThe group pushing Florida's abortion access amendment has filed a federal lawsuit against Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, accusing the Gov. Ron DeSantis-appointed official of violating its First Amendment rights.\nCited is how the state Department of Health sent a cease-and-desist order to television stations, threatening them with criminal prosecution if they continued running an advertisement from the group, Floridians Protecting Freedom.\n\"FPF is running and intends to continue running television advertisements and to engage in other political speech advocating for the passage of Amendment 4 and calling attention to the dangerous consequences of current Florida law on women\u2019s rights and health,\" the group wrote in the lawsuit, filed Wednesday morning in the Tallahassee-based U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida.\n\"It is intolerable that FPF do so with the State dangling a sword of Damocles over anyone who would facilitate that core political expression \u2014 threatening broadcasters with criminal prosecution if they air viewpoints the State disagrees with, and silencing FPF\u2019s speech in the process,\" the group continued.\nIt asked the court to order the state to stop taking any other actions that \"coerce, threaten, or intimate repercussions\" to stations airing its speech.\nThe advertisement in question features a Florida woman who was diagnosed with brain cancer while pregnant with her second child.\n\u201cThe doctors knew that if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,\" she says in the ad. \"Florida has now banned abortions, even in cases like mine.\"\nIn its letter, which was first obtained by Florida Politics, the department called that claim \"categorically false.\"\n\"While your company enjoys the right to broadcast political advertisements ... that right does not include free rein to disseminate false advertisements which, if believed, would likely have a detrimental effect on the lives and health of pregnant women in Florida,\" wrote John Wilson, who resigned as general counsel for the Florida Department of Health shortly after, according to the Miami Herald.\nFloridians Protecting Freedom, represented by firm Elias Law Group, is also suing Wilson.\nWhat else is happening?\nIt's not the first lawsuit the pro-amendment group has filed against the state in recent weeks.\nIn a legal challenge that was rejected by a Leon County judge, it also took issue with how DeSantis' Agency for Health Care Administration created a webpage bashing Amendment 4, which would ensure abortion access in Florida if it gets at least 60% of the vote. The state also paid for television advertisements directing people to the page.\nTensions have also risen after the office of Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, who is also appointed by DeSantis, released a report with allegations of fraudulent signatures and petition-gatherers being paid illegally per signature for the abortion amendment.\nThe pro-amendment campaign decried that, saying the \u201cattempt to undermine Floridians' right to vote on Amendment 4 is desperate.\u201d\nAdam Richardson, a Palm Beach County attorney, also sued over the website and advertisement, but the Florida Supreme Court ruled against him.\nHe has since filed an elections fraud complaint against Jason Weida, secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration, alleging the official has illegally used his position to try to tank the amendment.\nRichardson filed another fraud complaint on Tuesday, this one against Erik Dellenback, DeSantis' faith liaison.\nThe attorney took issue with how he spoke at a recent anti-amendment event that was advertised by the Governor\u2019s Faith and Community Initiative \u2014 and said he was representing the government in the process.\n\u201cTonight, I represent government, but I have spent way more time as a faith person than I have as a government person. And this was a biblical issue before it was a political issue,\u201d Dellenback said during the event, as reported by the Florida Phoenix.\nThis reporting content is supported by a partnership with Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.

      "text": "Background check: UCLA supervisor wouldn't recommend Joseph Ladapo for Florida Surgeon General job\nA former supervisor of Joseph Ladapo would not recommend him for the job of Florida's surgeon general, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's background investigation for his confirmation to the top medical post.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the people of Florida would be better served by a Surgeon General who grounds his policy decisions and recommendations on the best scientific evidence rather than opinions,\u201d the unnamed supervisor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in the Jan. 18 report prepared by a senior crime intelligence analyst for the Senate.\nThe supervisor added that Ladapo\u2019s contrary views about COVID-19 created a stressful environment for his research and clinical colleagues and subordinates at UCLA. They felt his opinions, published in national news outlets, knocking \u201cCOVID mania\u201d and lockdowns violated the duty in the Hippocratic Oath to behave honestly and ethically, the supervisor said.\nMore coverage from the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida:\n- Senate Democrats walk out as Republicans on panel OK Joseph Ladapo as Florida Surgeon General\n- Florida Department of Health rejects complaint against Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo\n- Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show\n- DeSantis mega-donor, UF Board of Trustees chair supplied Ladapo's resume, fast-tracking surgeon general's hire\n- COVID in Florida: Decoding the data behind state surgeon general's policies\n- Fact checking Florida Surgeon General Ladapo: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\nLadapo's views also led to \"stress and acrimony among his coworkers and supervisors during the last year and a half of his employment,\u201d he said in the report obtained through a public records request to the Senate by the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida.\nThe only reason Ladapo received a favorable review was because he did the job he was hired to do, the supervisor said.\n\u201cIt is important to note that during this time at UCLA, he met all of the contractual obligations for the position that he was hired to perform, which is the underpinning of my otherwise satisfactory evaluation,\u201d the supervisor said.\nIn responding to the supervisor's scathing assessment, Jeremy Redfern, press secretary for the Department of Health, characterized Ladapo as a misunderstood visionary who is under attack for having \"difficult discussions\" about what's best for people during the pandemic.\n\"Doctors who were considered ahead of their time were applauded for their brilliance throughout history, but it now appears that being at the forefront of ideas and following the data is now considered a political game,\" Redfern said.\n\u25ba Read the FDLE report on Ladapo obtained through a public records request\nReaction to background check: 'I wish I was surprised'\nThe Harvard-educated Ladapo was a tenured associate professor of medicine in the General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research Division at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine from June 2016 to September 2021.\nThat's when Ladapo was tapped by Gov. Ron DeSantis at the same time he was quickly hired by the University of Florida College of Medicine as an associate professor in general internal medicine.\nHis contract requires him to spend 80% of his time as surgeon general and running the Department of Health, and 20% teaching and conducting research at UF. His combined salary is $437,000 a year.\nLadapo, who replaced Dr. Scott Rivkees, now a professor at Brown University in Rhode Island, is going through the confirmation process in the Senate. After a party-line vote to approve his nomination in the first hearing, he has one more appearance at the Ethics and Elections Committee before his confirmation goes to a floor vote.\nThe FDLE conducted a comprehensive background investigation as a part of the confirmation process as required by state law. The FDLE checked state criminal databases and investigative files, driver license history, credit reports, employment verification, state and local law enforcement and district attorneys, court records, property tax records and professional licensure records and found no derogatory information other than the supervisor's comments.\nThe agency also said it was unable to verify Ladapo's employment status with the University of Florida using the automated, fee-based verification system that requires a \"work number\" to proceed.\n\"I wish I was surprised but I'm not,\" said Sen. Annette Taddeo, D-Miami, co-chair of the Ethics and Elections Committee and a candidate for governor. \"It's very clear that the Senate should not confirm his nomination under any circumstances.\"\nLadapo is creating the same discomfort in Florida that he created at UCLA, she said, noting the recent decision to place Orange County's top health official on administrative leave after he sent an email to staff encouraging them to get vaccinated. The department hasn\u2019t given a specific reason for his being placed on leave but is investigating if any laws were broken.\nHealth director suspended: DeSantis administration puts Florida health director on leave after encouraging vaccinations for his staff\nThe unnamed supervisor's warning is apropos, Taddeo said, because Floridians are seeing \"actual health professionals being punished and shut down ... because they expressed a medical opinion and made a recommendation based on science.\"\nRedfern said the supervisor's comments are an attempt to smear Ladapo's reputation ahead of his confirmation hearing.\n\"It\u2019s unfortunate that a single comment from a disgruntled supervisor would find facilitating discussions a cause for concern, especially during such an ever-evolving medical landscape,\" Redfern said. \"This is not cause for concern.\"\nRedfern pointed to several of Ladapo's accomplishments during his 10 years as a medical researcher and academic, including:\n- Millions of dollars in grants from the National Institutes of Health to study cardiovascular disease and tobacco cessation;\n- Funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, to research patient-centered approaches to improving the health of individuals evaluated for coronary artery disease; and\n- Research on behavioral economic interventions to promote sustainable cardiovascular health, including among adults with HIV.\nUCLA supervisor's comments back up MSNBC report\nThe supervisor\u2019s comments underscore what four of Ladapo\u2019s colleagues told MSNBC under condition of anonymity in November.\nIn the early days of the pandemic, Ladapo wrote several articles, including pieces for USA TODAY and the Wall Street Journal, about \u201cCOVID mania,\u201d advising against lockdowns and mask mandates, based on his own experience treating patients infected with COVID-19.\nUCLA tried to get the Wall Street Journal to add a disclaimer to the column Ladapo wrote for them, but to no avail, according to an MSNBC report in November.\nLadapo was also among the dozen or so physicians calling themselves America\u2019s Frontline Doctors who appeared on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2020 to tout hydroxychloroquine as a treatment against COVID-19, a drug that has been found to have no benefit against the disease.\nThe group's co-founder Simone Gold, who introduced Ladapo as a friend at other events, was indicted in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.\nOne of the participants was Dr. Stella Immanuel, who has stated that some ailments are caused by \"demon sperm\" and that alien DNA is used in some medical treatments.\nThe four who spoke to MSNBC said Ladapo\u2019s appearance in that news conference raised concerns at UCLA about the credibility of his work and the impact his words were having on the university.\n\u201cA lot of people here at UCLA are glad that he is gone because we were embarrassed by his opinions and behavior. At the same time, we don\u2019t wish this on the people of Florida. They don\u2019t deserve to have someone like him making their health decisions,\u201d said one of the UCLA sources.\nLadapo has stirred things up since first day on job\nLadapo has stirred up controversy since day one as Surgeon General.\nHe signaled a dramatic departure from his predecessor and from federal health officials by saying fear wouldn\u2019t dictate his decisions. He\u2019s made public statements downplaying the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine and wearing masks to slow the spread of the pandemic.\nOn his second day on the job, Ladapo signed an emergency order that strengthened bans on school mask mandates and stripped schools of the authority to quarantine students who had come in contact with the COVID-19 virus for up to four days, leaving that decision to parents.\nA month later, he drew the ire of Senate Democrats, and Senate President Wilton Simpson, a Republican, when he refused to wear a mask in the office of state Sen. Tina Polsky at her request. She was being treated for cancer at the time.\nAt his first confirmation hearing, he refused to apologize for his interaction with Polsky. He also was asked five times whether the COVID-19 vaccines worked and declined to give a yes-or-no answer.\nHis long and often evasive answers triggered Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book to lead a walk out of her fellow Democrats before the committee voted to recommend Ladapo\u2019s confirmation.\n\"We have an extreme amount of respect for the process, but we are not getting any answers,\" Book said.\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

Powerball made history again when three tickets matched all six numbers to win $1.586 billion in the (Wednesday) Jan. 13, 2016, drawing.\nThe jackpot started Nov. 4, 2015, at $40 million.

However, lottery experts have said there are ways to remain anonymous.\nFun fact: Of the 11 times a Mega Millions or Powerball lottery jackpot reached $1 billion, two of them came from a Florida beachside Publix store with the grand prize at $1.586 billion and $1.58 billion.\n3rd biggest jackpot: Who won $1.586 billion Powerball drawing on Jan. 13, 2016?\nThree tickets purchased in California, Florida and Tennessee won the Jan. 13, 2016, Powerball drawing, splitting $1.586 billion.\nIn 2016, FLORIDA TODAY reported Maureen Smith and David Kaltschmidt bought their winning Powerball ticket at a Publix in Melbourne Beach.

California Lottery said he represented a group of winners. In California, a big jackpot winner must claim the ticket in person. It was purchased at Midway Market in California.\nThe 1st or largest jackpot: Who won $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot?\nThe largest lottery prize ever climbed to $2.04 billion in November. The jackpot was an estimated $1.9 billion days before the drawing, but lottery ticket sales helped it grow to more than $2 billion after updated calculations. A single ticket purchased in California won the grand prize, and (fun fact) the winner was revealed on Valentine's Day \u2212 Feb. 14, 2023.\nEdwin Castro won the largest-ever lottery jackpot, and he opted for a lump sum of $997.6 million, just shy of $1 billion, according to the California Lottery.\nHow long does it take for a Powerball or Mega Millions lottery to reach $1 billion?\nIt varies depending on the number of rollovers and ticket sales. Sometimes it\u2019s just over two or three months of drawings.\nHow long do you have to cash in a winning Florida Lottery ticket?\nPrizes for Florida Lottery must be claimed within 180 days (six months) from the date of the drawing.

      "text": "Florida surgeon general says raw milk has health benefits. Experts say he's wrong\n- Florida officials support the right of individuals to consume raw milk despite state law prohibiting its sale for human consumption.\n- Raw milk consumption, linked to recent hospitalizations in Florida, carries potential health risks despite claims of benefits.\n- Multiple health organizations maintain that raw milk offers no additional health advantages over pasteurized milk.\nFlorida law says it's illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption, but that's not stopping some of the state's top officials from supporting residents who want to drink it.\nSome have even made a complete 180, from promoting pasteurized milk to promoting consumer freedom within days.\nIn an Aug. 12 post on X, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo said Floridians \"have the freedom to make informed health choices.\"\n\"I support the decision to consume raw milk when sought for potential health benefits and protective factors. Be aware of your source and know the risks,\" Ladapo wrote.\nIllness from raw milk can cause diarrhea, stomach cramping and vomiting, and severe complications can lead to paralysis, kidney failure, stroke, or even death, federal authorities say.\nInterest in raw milk has been growing in recent years. In June 2024, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he \"only drinks raw milk.\"\nRaw milk doesn't cure ailments, experts say\nRaw milk devotees say it tastes better and is healthier, but according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the American Medical Association, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, raw milk does not contain any extra beneficial bacteria and will not cure or treat asthma, allergies or lactose intolerance.\nFlorida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson agreed with Ladapo in a statement given to the USA TODAY NETWORK \u2013 Florida on Aug. 12: \u201cState Surgeon General Ladapo and I share the same position on raw milk. People should make informed decisions.\"\nTo be sure, it's a reversal to what his agency was saying a week ago.\nIn a press release on Aug. 6, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services encouraged Floridians to drink \"only\" pasteurized milk.\n\"Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) are encouraging Floridians to protect their health by only consuming pasteurized milk products,\" the press release says.\n\u201cFlorida\u2019s pasteurized milk supply is safe, nutritious, and closely controlled from the farm to your local grocery store,\u201d Simpson said in the release. \u201cThere have been no reported illnesses from pasteurized milk products in Florida, so Floridians should continue to buy and enjoy nutritious and wholesome dairy products from Florida farmers.\u201d\nAs previously reported earlier this month, 21 people got sick and seven were hospitalized for bacterial infections, including E. coli, from drinking raw milk from Keely Farms Dairy in New Smyrna Beach.\nRaw milk: OK as pet food in Florida\nRaw milk can be sold as pet food in Florida, but it must be clearly labeled \"not for human consumption.\" the Keely Farms' webpage did not mention pets.\nSix of the infected people were children under age 10, the Florida Department of Health said. The cases were all in Central and Northeast Florida.\nAccording to the CDC, improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other food-borne disease source.\nAnd so far in 2025, there have been seven recalls or outbreaks from raw milk in the United States.\nAna Go\u00f1i-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida, can be reached at agonilessan@gannett.com."

      "text": "Florida surgeon general defends opposition to COVID-19 vaccines for children before Congress\nThe chair of a congressional committee on Wednesday berated Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo for being the only state in the country to not pre-order COVID-19 vaccines for children under five.\n\u201cThe steps Governor DeSantis has taken to impede access to lifesaving coronavirus vaccines for Florida\u2019s young children have made it harder for parents across the state to get their children vaccinated, and his promotion of anti-vaccine misinformation is making it harder for parents to make fully informed decisions on how best to protect children\u2019s health,\" said U.S. Rep. James E. Clyburn, D-S.C., who chairs the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.\nLadapo, who appeared Tuesday before the subcommittee, defended Florida\u2019s opposition to COVID-19 vaccines for young children as a fact-based choice.\nThe briefing came just days after Florida emerged as the only state in the country not to pre-order the vaccine for toddlers.\nLadapo said the decision was made in agreement with DeSantis. He and the governor believed there was \"very little demand\" for it and remain \"affirmatively against\" it, despite the recommendation of federal health experts.\nFlorida doctors order shots: Florida doctors begin ordering COVID shots for young kids as DeSantis and White House feud\nBlasted: Nikki Fried goes on offensive after DeSantis rebukes COVID shots for young kids\nFlorida did not pre-order COVID vaccines: As FDA authorizes COVID vaccines for young kids, Florida is only state not to pre-order supply\n\"In Florida, we don\u2019t recommend\u201d coronavirus vaccines for children under 18, Ladapo told lawmakers according to a press release issued by the committee.\nLadapo further asserted there is \"little data\" proving the vaccine is beneficial to young children and that they are at \"low risk\" if infected with the virus.\nOf the 75,096 COVID-19 deaths tallied in Florida, only 46 are categorized under the age of 16, according to the Florida Department of Health's latest data.\nLadapo's remarks drew the ire of Clyburn, who's led the subcommittee since its inception. Congress established the subcommittee in 2020 to examine the pandemic and the nation's response.\n\"I urge the governor to abandon this dangerous, anti-scientific approach, and I strongly encourage all parents of young children to provide them with the lifesaving protection of coronavirus vaccines as soon as possible,\" Clyburn said.\nIn response to Clyburn, Ladapo on Wedndeday took issue with subcommittee\u2019s portrayal of the congressional briefing. In a statement, he accused Clyburn and the subcommittee of mischaracterizing the conversation and using it as a \u201claunching pad\u201d for political attacks.\nLadapo later published a document outlining his positions and disputing assertions that Florida attempted to limit vaccine access. Pre-ordering the vaccine, he contended, is an \u201cunnecessary relic\u201d from a time when supply was low and demand was high, particularly among elderly populations.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that staff used this education meeting as a launching pad for politically charged attacks,\u201d Ladapo said.\nAmong other critiques, the subcommittee lamented that Florida did not allow doctors and healthcare providers to pre-order the vaccine via the state until after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted it emergency use authorization.\nThe FDA's vaccine advisers recommended the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer for little kids on June 15. The panel of outside experts voted unanimously that the benefits of the shots outweigh any risks for children under 5. They are the last age group in the U.S. without access to COVID-19 vaccines and many parents have been eager to protect their little children. The CDC advisors also recommended the vaccines.\nLadapo acknowledged its decision and defended it. He further acknowledged that forgoing the pre-order period may have resulted in a delay in the vaccine's statewide distribution.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe it should be offered at all and we\u2019ve communicated that to Floridians,\" Ladapo purportedly said.\nTuesday's briefing marks Florida's latest resistance to federal health guidance and leaders. While doctors may now order the vaccine, Florida will not support the distribution effort. Nor will they allow county health departments to administer it.\nThe subcommittee reported that more than 1.1 million children under five receive primary care at county health departments in Florida. Without the cooperation of county health departments, roughly 33,000 young children will need to seek vaccines elsewhere.\nDemocratic officials and even the White House fear the move will disproportionately harm poor, rural and minority children.\nLadapo began leading Florida's Department of Health in early 2022. A Harvard graduate, he's faced ongoing criticism over a slew of issues \u2014 issuing an order preventing schools from quarantining students exposed to COVID-19 and refusing to wear a mask in the office of a senator who was receiving cancer treatments, among others situations.\nThe governor\u2019s office, though, has repeatedly pointed to Ladapo\u2019s medical degree and Ph.D. from Harvard University and his experience as a clinical researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles studying obesity and cardiac disease.\nThe only statutory requirement for surgeon general, a position created in 2007 by then-GOP Gov. Charlie Crist, is that the person be a physician licensed under state law with \u201cadvanced training or extensive experience in public health administration.\u201d\nJason Delgado is a reporter for the USA Today Network-Florida.

      "text": "Scott Rivkees, former Florida Surgeon General, leaving the University of Florida\nRivkees also has been a professor of pediatrics at the UF College of Medicine\nDr. Scott Rivkees, the embattled former Florida surgeon general who was kept out of the public eye for more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic for recommending people wear masks until a vaccine was developed, is leaving the University of Florida.\nRivkees, who also has been a professor of pediatrics at the UF College of Medicine, told the school on Oct. 15 that he was resigning his post effective Jan. 31, 2022, UF Health spokesman Ken Garcia confirmed in an email.\nThe development comes a little over four months after he stepped down as surgeon general and head of the Florida Department of Health Sept. 20. The next day, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced his successor, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, an associate research professor from the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine who had just been hired by the UF College of Medicine.\nBack story:\n- 'Grave concerns': Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo's medical license OK'd in two days\n- DeSantis mega-donor, UF Board of Trustees chair supplied Ladapo's resume, fast-tracking surgeon general's hire\n- Florida Surgeon General Ladapo says he can't 'communicate effectively' in his refusal to wear mask in Polsky's office\nRivkees also put his historic Duck Pond house in Gainesville up for sale recently for $629,000 and already has it under contract. Known as the Pepper House, the five-bedroom, 3.5 bath house across from the Thomas Center was part of the dairy barn of the Thomas family farm and was once home to former Gainesville Sun publisher William Pepper.\nRivkees did not respond to requests for comment via email or phone call, and could not be reached at his home address. He is named in several lawsuits challenging orders related to COVID-19, and both parties are sparring over whether he must testify, and what topics a \u201ccorporate\u201d representative for DOH would have to testify to.\nRivkees out: Scott Rivkees relinquishes Florida surgeon general role, returns to academia at UF\nMore: Judge shields Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees from deposition in mask fight\nRivkees' controversial tenure as Surgeon General\nA graduate of Rutgers University and the former University of Medicine and Dentistry, both in New Jersey, Rivkees was a tenured professor at Yale and associate chair for research before joining the faculty at UF in 2012.\nBy the time he accepted the position of surgeon general in April 2019, Rivkees was chair of the pediatrics department at the UF College of Medicine and physician-in-chief of UF Health Shands Children\u2019s Hospital.\nThe selection of Rivkees drew immediate criticism because of a 2014 harassment complaint, first reported by the News Service of Florida, which delayed a vote on his confirmation by a year when then-Senate President Bill Galvano said the allegations were serious enough to look into. Rivkees' attorney said he acknowledged making inappropriate comments and had \u201cmoved on\u201d from the incident, according to reports.\nBy the time the Senate confirmed Rivkees by a 31-9 vote on March 13, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had hit Florida and Rivkees had been on the job for a year.\nUnder the terms of the contract \u2014 signed June 19 and June 20, 2019 \u2014 the state paid UF $35,000 a quarter, or $140,000 a year, for Rivkees' time and services while he retained full professor status and salary at UF. His UF salary at the start of the contract was nearly $547,000 a year, but records show his salary for 2020-21 was reduced to $242,721 a year.\nWhen he returned to UF in September his salary was around $240,000 a year.\nState law allows an \"employee interchange agreement\" between state agencies for up to two years, with a three-month extension if agreed upon by all parties involved. Ladapo has dual appointments under the same agreement, and is expected to spend 80% of his time running the Department of Health and 20% at UF for a combined salary of $437,000 a year.\nRivkees' public appearances started becoming less frequent in April 2020. That was when he was walked out of a news briefing in the Florida Capitol after he said people would have to continue social distancing until a vaccine could be approved.\n\"So as long as we're going to have COVID in the environment, and this is a tough virus, we're going to have to practice these measures so that we are all protected,\" Rivkees said, adding it could be a year or more before a vaccine was available.\nHelen Aguirre Ferre, then the governor's communications director, walked over to Rivkees and whispered in his ear. Rivkees said \"OK\" before Ferre escorted him out.\nWhile Rivkees has made few public appearances since then, he has signed several orders in response to the pandemic.\nOne of those orders incurred the wrath of a group of retired pediatricians who published an op-ed piece calling for his resignation even after praising his 33-year career and research for the National Institutes of Health.\nThey wondered why Rivkees was not holding town hall meetings in communities with low vaccination rates to get people to overcome their vaccine hesitancy.\nThey also criticized him for not advocating the position of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that schools require all staff and students over the age of 2 to wear a mask unless they have a medical or developmental reason not to wear one.\nSubscribe today using the link at the top of the page and never miss a story."

      "text": "When Dr. Ken Pang published one of the first large-scale analyses of gender-affirming care on transgender children, in 2018, the paper was celebrated as a vital contribution and even made its way to the home page of the r/Science subreddit.\nThough the evidence was limited, the review suggested that hormone blockers and hormone replacement therapy could help alleviate gender dysphoria and make transgender youth feel more at home in their own bodies.\nVideos by VICE\nFour years later, Pang was shocked to learn that his research was being used by Florida\u2019s Department of Health to justify denying gender-affirming care to all minors in the state. The department cited Pang\u2019s work in a memo issued in April, after the passage of Florida\u2019s so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law. The memo even recommends against social transition, which can include changes as simple as using new pronouns or wearing different clothing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those moments where your heart sinks,\u201d Pang, a clinician and scientist at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Australia, told VICE News. \u201cOne of the first principles [in the medical field] is to do no harm. So to be seeing the research we\u2019ve done being utilized in this way\u2014I was just dismayed by that.\u201d\nPang had no idea that Florida was misusing his work until VICE News reached out for comment. And he\u2019s not alone. VICE News spoke to 10 researchers who said they weren\u2019t aware of the memo and that Florida\u2019s Department of Health misstated their research; in fact, VICE News found that all 12 citations Florida presents against the use of gender-affirming care are either distorted or from a source with clear anti-trans bias. In crafting the document, Florida\u2019s health department reverse-engineered rationale for a policy completely counter to research-based medical best practices.\n\u201cNO, this is NOT an appropriate use of our work,\u201d another researcher cited in Florida\u2019s memo told VICE News via email on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized by their institution to speak on the record. \u201cThis does not mean denying transgender youth and certainly not gender-affirming care!\u201d\nFor decades, the standards of care put out by the leading medical professional organizations have been consistent on how to treat young people experiencing gender dysphoria. Despite these clear guidelines, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis set the state on a campaign to vastly restrict the rights and medical resources available to transgender people when he signed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill into law in March. The new law bans any mention of sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third-grade classrooms and had an overall chilling effect on the freedoms of LGBTQ people in the state.\n\u201cNO, this is NOT an appropriate use of our work. This does not mean denying transgender youth and certainly not gender-affirming care!\u201d\nLess than a month after \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d became law, the Florida Department of Health released its memo attempting to provide a scientific explanation for denying gender-affirming care.\nThen in June, Florida\u2019s Agency for Health Care Administration also issued a new policy that no one, not even adults, would be able to access gender-affirming care through Medicaid. Rather than referring to the overwhelming body of research that shows positive outcomes of gender-affirming care, Florida instead commissioned hundreds of pages of new material\u2014which did not go through a standard peer-review process\u2014to justify the change. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo then wrote the state medical board and used these documents as the basis to \u201c[recommend] against certain pharmaceutical, non-pharmaceutical, and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria.\u201d\nWhile particularly aggressive, Florida is hardly alone in its attacks. Just this year, 36 other states have also introduced or signed legislation restricting the rights of trans people.\nGender Dysphoria, described as significant distress due to a mismatch between someone\u2019s gender identity and their gender assigned at birth, is included in the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). It\u2019s actually been in the DSM since 1980. And gender-affirming medical care has been practiced since the early 20th century.\nDoctors have three tools to offer children with gender dysphoria: puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014assuring the child and their family that their feelings are normal and should be supported. Puberty blockers given to pubescent children will halt the puberty process and can also aid medical transition later in adulthood, if desired. Teenagers and legal adults may elect to receive hormone replacement therapy, which promotes masculinization or feminization.\nThe effects of puberty blockers are reversible if stopped. Many, but not all effects of hormone replacement therapy are reversible, though infertility is a possible outcome. Gender-affirming genital surgery is not performed on minors.\nDoctors speak out\nTransgender people make up about one-half of 1 percent of the population\u2014about half as many people who have red hair. And the number of young people who identify as transgender, nonbinary, or gender-nonconforming is growing, according to the CDC.\nYet when Pang started his comprehensive review of the available medical literature on healthcare for transgender kids, he found only 13 studies he could use. He and his team at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute then published their findings in an article in Pediatrics, one of the premier medical journals in the field.\nFlorida\u2019s memo denying gender-affirming care to kids contains one specific sentence which directly quotes Pang\u2019s work: \u201cOne review concludes that \u2018hormonal treatments for transgender adolescents can achieve their intended physical effects, but evidence regarding their psychosocial and cognitive impact is generally lacking.\u2019\u201d\nPang\u2019s paper does contain that sentence, but he told VICE News that it\u2019s taken vastly out of context. A lack of evidence doesn\u2019t mean the treatment isn\u2019t working or worthwhile\u2014rather, that more research needs to be done to offer the best care possible. Pang\u2019s paper is also five years old.\n\u201cIt seems rather disingenuous for the Florida Department of Health to be using what they presumably know to be an out-of-date statement to support a blanket ban on gender-affirming care,\u201d Pang said, \u201cwhile at the same time ignoring the more recent evidence which shows, for instance, that gender-affirming medical care is associated with improvements in mental health.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a lot more emerging literature. This is a fast-moving space,\u201d Pang added. \u201cAnd increasingly, the evidence shows that the provision of gender-affirming medical care is helpful.\u201d\nIn July, for example, a researcher at Princeton, Dr. Kristina Olsen, published a landmark longitudinal study that followed more than 300 trans-identified youth, aged 3-12, for five years. By the study\u2019s end, only 2.5 percent of the group had \u201cretransitioned\u201d to their assigned gender at birth.\n\u201cIt seems rather disingenuous for the Florida Department of Health to be using what they presumably know to be an out-of-date statement to support a blanket ban on gender-affirming care.\u201d\nAnother grossly misrepresented study in Florida\u2019s memo relates to social transition.\n\u201cSocial gender transition should not be a treatment option for children or adolescents,\u201d the memo reads, linking to an article called \u201cNot social transition status, but peer relations and family functioning predict psychological functioning in a German clinical sample of children with Gender Dysphoria,\u201d published in the medical journal Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry.\nA cursory glance at the article, especially by a non-medical professional, might lead someone to interpret it the way Florida\u2019s health department does: as an argument against social transition.\nBut all five authors of the paper, responding to an inquiry from VICE News, issued a statement that Florida had egregiously misused their work, partly because the study involved a clinical sample of only 54 children.\n\u201cTherefore, our results cannot be generalized to every child diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and it did not look at long-term effects,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOn the contrary, the authors recommend every child should have the opportunity to explore their gender [emphasis theirs], which for some children may entail transitioning socially.\u201d\nElisabeth Sievert, who\u2019s the lead author and a researcher at the University of Erfurt in Germany, also explained that it\u2019s not that social transition isn\u2019t effective or necessary but rather that peer and family support can be even more important for the mental health of the child.\n\u201cWe were not aware that the Florida Health Department was going to cite our work to issue a blanket ban on gender-affirming care for children. We were also not contacted by the Florida Health Department to double-check if the implications of our research were summarized correctly,\u201d the joint statement continued.\nAnother distorted citation\u2014one that not only appears in the Florida memo but is also heralded by anti-trans propagandists\u2014comes from a 2015 study called \u201cGender Dysphoria in Childhood.\u201d According to the Florida memo, this paper \u201cstates that 80% of those seeking clinical care will lose their desire to identify with the non-birth sex.\u201d\nBut in an interview with VICE News, one of the paper\u2019s co-authors, Dr. Thomas Steensma at the Amsterdam University Medical Center, said that number was taken wildly out of context.\nEighty percent, Steensma explained, related to a specific population of prepubescent children in The Netherlands. And, he added, even if it were true that 80 percent of children who identified as transgender later would eventually go back to identifying as their assigned sex at birth\u2014\u201dIf you have 20 percent, why does that mean that you should not explore [gender identity] with a child?\u201d\nCiting Steensma\u2019s work in an effort to ban trans-affirming care should also raise alarm bells because he\u2019s the principal investigator at his university\u2019s Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria and one of the world\u2019s leading experts on medical care of transgender children. He helped create what\u2019s known as the \u201cDutch protocol,\u201d internationally accepted medical guidelines on how to administer puberty blockers to prepubescent children with gender dysphoria. Steensma is also a co-author of World Professional Association of Transgender Health\u2019s (WPATH) forthcoming Standards of Care for the treatment of transgender children, which will be published this year.\nSteensma was aware of his work being used as evidence against transgender medicine but did not know about Florida\u2019s memo before being contacted by VICE News.\nIn fact, none of the researchers VICE News reached out to for this story had heard of the memo in which they were cited.\nFlorida\u2019s memo, however, did catch the attention of World Professional Association of Transgender Health. Their U.S. affiliate (USPATH) issued a statement in response that unequivocally opposes several states\u2019 recent efforts, including Florida\u2019s, to deny transgender care to minors.\n\u201cSpecifically, the justification included in recent Florida Department of Health guidelines claiming that such treatment confers an \u2018unacceptably high risk of doing harm\u2019 has numerous such misinterpretations and distortions,\u201d the statement reads.\nThe U.S. Professional Association of Transgender Health takes issue with one theme, in particular, in Florida\u2019s memo: that blockers and hormone replacement therapy present an \u201cunacceptably high risk of doing harm,\u201d due to a lack of clinical trials of gender-affirming medicine for minors.\n\u201cThere are not a lot of double-blinded, randomized, controlled trials going on in pediatrics, because it\u2019s unethical,\u201d said Dr. Maddie Deutsch, president of USPATH and the director of the transgender program at University of California-San Francisco. \u201cThe kids who are getting the placebo are going to know it.\u201d\nDeutsch explained that those forms of clinical trial tend to be used to test new forms of drugs used for new purposes; gender-affirming blockers and hormone replacement therapy, by contrast, have been around for decades and have long been shown to work.\nLots of forms of medicine already operate without the existence of \u201chigh-quality\u201d data gathered in a randomized, double-blinded trial. That\u2019s especially true in cases that would involve putting a vulnerable group on a placebo instead of a drug known to work\u2014such as testing the use of antidepressants during pregnancy.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to give a bunch of pregnant people who have depression placebos,\u201d Deutsch said. \u201cIt would be unethical because people develop postpartum depression, [and it\u2019s] a serious condition. It involves infanticide and suicide.\u201d\nThe costs in such cases, in other words, are clearly outweighed by the benefits. \u201cAre there potentially some unknown harms? Maybe,\u201d Deutsch said. \u201cBut the benefits that we know about are so strong that we stick with it.\u201d\n\u201cThere are not a lot of double-blinded, randomized, controlled trials going on in pediatrics, because it\u2019s unethical. The kids who are getting the placebo are going to know it.\u201d\nWhen asked for comment about Florida\u2019s rationale for denying gender-affirming care to minors, Jeremy Redfern, press secretary for the state\u2019s Department of Health, said the data squarely supported the state\u2019s policy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you know how the \u2018burden of proof\u2019 works in the sciences,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cI\u2019d suggest doing some reading and coming back once you understand.\u201d\nArguing against well-established transgender medicine is a bit of a hobby-horse for Redfern, who\u2019s responsible for communicating the tangible results of Florida\u2019s healthcare policies. He often uses his personal Twitter account to tweet disinformation about gender-affirming care and troll members of the press when they seek clarity on the state\u2019s policies.\nIn addition to distorting good science, the memo put out by Redfern\u2019s department also includes citations to work by anti-trans activists.\nOne of them is Dr. William J. Malone, an Idaho-based physician and co-founder of the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine (SEGM), which describes itself as a group \u201cconcerned about the lack of quality evidence for the use of hormonal and surgical interventions as first-line treatment for young people with gender dysphoria.\u201d But the organization uses several of the same tactics\u2014and the same citations\u2014as Florida\u2019s memo.\nIn fact, the Yale School of Medicine published an article in April that calls out the Society of Evidence-Based Gender Medicine as a small group of anti-trans activists \u201cwithout apparent ties to mainstream scientific of professional organizations\u201d that works to misrepresent science and serve as a basis for lawmakers to criminalize transgender care.\nMalone\u2019s writings have also cited the work of Oxford University epidemiologist and anti-vaccine activist Carl Heneghan, and he has also signal-boosted an anti-trans propaganda site called Reduxx.info.\nIn a statement to VICE News, Malone refuted that his organization is transphobic.\n\u201c[T]he field has become so politicized that even medical journals have succumbed to these pressures,\u201d Malone wrote. \u201cThis is a big problem, and the results of such an irresponsible approach to medicine will harm the very people these researchers believe they are helping. At the same time, scientific debate is rarely platformed for the fear of being accused of \u2018transphobia.\u2019\u201d\nAnother anti-trans source in the Florida memo is Dr. Paul Hruz, who teaches pediatric medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. But Hruz\u2019s own faculty page does not describe any experience or expertise in treating gender dysphoria or transgender populations. He\u2019s also been affiliated with the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), which has advocated for the forced sterilization of transgender people and is designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. In 2020, St. Louis Pride issued a statement condemning him.\nIn a statement to VICE News, Hruz dismissed St. Louis Pride\u2019s \u201cattacks\u201d on him by people \u201cunwilling to discuss the actual scientific evidence in this field.\u201d\n\u201cI have been academically involved in scientific discussions related to the care of gender dysphoric youth for over a decade,\u201d Hruz said. \u201cI have also participated in the care of children with disorders of sexual development throughout my career.\u201d\nHruz did not elaborate on where or in what capacity he worked with such children, but he does not do so for his position at Washington University, according to Dr. Christopher Lewis, co-director of Washington University\u2019s Pediatric Transgender Health program.\n\u201cThe views expressed by Hruz are his own, and he is not speaking on behalf of the division of pediatric endocrinology,\u201d Lewis told VICE News. \u201cHe is not a provider within either DSD [Differences of Sex Development] clinic or our transgender center.\u201d\n\u2018We\u2019re talking about toddlers\u2019\nFlorida\u2019s memo came less than a month after an unequivocal statement of support of gender-affirming for minors issues by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): \u201cGender-affirming care for minors, when medically appropriate and necessary, improves their physical and mental health. Attempts to restrict, challenge, or falsely characterize this potentially lifesaving care as abuse is dangerous,\u201d the agency wrote.\nJaime Jara, a mother of three in Kissimmee, Florida, has seen that impact up-close in her family. Her youngest child, Dempsey, began to socially transition at the age of 5. For Dempsey, that meant using \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d pronouns, growing out her hair, and wearing feminine clothes. Dempsey\u2019s school honored her wishes and also allowed her to use the girls\u2019 bathroom.\nWhen Dempsey was born, Jara and her husband thought they\u2019d be able to use their two older sons\u2019 clothes as hand-me-downs. But Dempsey refused, throwing tantrums over any stereotypically masculine toy or piece of clothing given to her.\n\u201cWe knew that she was gender-nonconforming as early as 2,\u201d Jara told VICE News. \u201cShe just couldn\u2019t vocalize the word transgender. She didn\u2019t even have that vocabulary yet.\u201d\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t let Dempsey socially transition, I don\u2019t know if Dempsey would still be here,\u201d Jara added. \u201cAnd I know that sounds so shocking, but even at 5\u2014.\u201d Jara then detailed several acts of severe self-harm reported to her by other parents of very young transgender children. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not talking about the angsty teenager. We\u2019re talking about toddlers.\u201d\nFor Dempsey\u2014and many other transgender and gender-nonconforming children who have not yet gone through puberty\u2014a transition is solely a \u201csocial\u201d transition: new pronouns, new clothes, new hair, sometimes a new name (though Dempsey kept hers), and affirmation by peers and family. But even these simple acts are now verboten in Florida.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a late bloomer, so she\u2019s probably not going to be on blockers for another couple of years,\u201d Jara said. \u201cBut this is still a problem for us, because they\u2019re saying in that memo you can\u2019t affirm your kid by even letting them socially transition.\u201d\nJara is a high school history teacher and recently attended a teacher training on Holocaust education. The resonance, she said, was hard to ignore. \u201cFirst, they\u2019re systematically stripping away rights. Then you\u2019re starting to have to plan\u2014people in certain countries were like, \u2018OK, if we can leave fast enough, this won\u2019t affect us.\u2019 There are so many parallels.\u201d\nDespite Florida\u2019s sweeping efforts, which have been described as \u201cgenocide,\u201d Jara remains determined to get her daughter the care she needs. If and when the time comes for Dempsey to take hormone blockers, Jara is optimistic that their doctor will find a way to prescribe them. What\u2019s more worrying to her, though, is the overall political climate that seems to be getting more hostile by the day.\n\u201cAre we going to have to leave Florida? Are we going to have to move? And then it gets you to start thinking\u2014OK, well, DeSantis is throwing out breadcrumbs that he\u2019s going to run for president. What is the United States landscape going to look like if he becomes president?\n\u201cSo, yeah, it\u2019s scary. We just want to live. I just want my kid to live, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nCorrection 8/3: The text of this article has been updated to reflect that puberty blockers are recommended only for pubescent children. We regret the error.\nUpdate 8/5: The description of Reduxx.info and Carl Heneghan have been updated in this story.\nWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here."

(2) The State Board of Education, subject to the concurrence of the Department of Health, shall adopt rules to govern medical examinations and immunizations performed under this section.\n(3) The Department of Health may adopt rules necessary to administer and enforce this section. The Department of Health, after consultation with the Department of Education, shall adopt rules governing the immunization of children against, the testing for, and the control of preventable communicable diseases. The rules must include procedures for exempting a child from immunization requirements. Immunizations shall be required for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, tetanus, and other communicable diseases as determined by rules of the Department of Health. The manner and frequency of administration of the immunization or testing shall conform to recognized standards of medical practice. The Department of Health shall supervise and secure the enforcement of the required immunization. Immunizations required by this section shall be available at no cost from the county health departments.\n(4) Each district school board and the governing authority of each private school shall establish and enforce policies that:(a) Prior to admittance to or attendance in a public or private school, grades kindergarten through 12, or any other initial entrance into a Florida public or private school, require each child to have on file with the immunization registry a certification of immunization for the prevention of those communicable diseases for which immunization is required by the Department of Health. Any child who is excluded from participation in the immunization registry pursuant to s. 381.003(1)(e)2. must present or have on file with the school such certification of immunization. Certification of immunization shall be made on forms approved and provided by the Department of Health or be on file with the immunization registry and shall become a part of each student\u2019s permanent record, to be transferred when the student transfers, is promoted, or changes schools. The transfer of such immunization certification by Florida public schools shall be accomplished using the Florida Automated System for Transferring Education Records and shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this section. (b) Require the screening of students for scoliosis at the appropriate age.\n(5) The provisions of this section shall not apply if:(a) The parent of the child objects in writing that the administration of immunizing agents conflicts with his or her religious tenets or practices;\n(b) A physician licensed under the provisions of chapter 458 or chapter 459 certifies in writing, on a form approved and provided by the Department of Health, that the child should be permanently exempt from the required immunization for medical reasons stated in writing, based upon valid clinical reasoning or evidence, demonstrating the need for the permanent exemption;\n(c) A physician licensed under the provisions of chapter 458, chapter 459, or chapter 460 certifies in writing, on a form approved and provided by the Department of Health, that the child has received as many immunizations as are medically indicated at the time and is in the process of completing necessary immunizations;\n(d) The Department of Health determines that, according to recognized standards of medical practice, any required immunization is unnecessary or hazardous; or\n(e) An authorized school official issues a temporary exemption, for up to 30 school days, to permit a student who transfers into a new county to attend class until his or her records can be obtained. Children and youths who are experiencing homelessness and children who are known to the department, as defined in s. 39.0016, shall be given a temporary exemption for 30 school days. The public school health nurse or authorized private school official is responsible for followup of each such student until proper documentation or immunizations are obtained. An exemption for 30 days may be issued for a student who enters a juvenile justice program to permit the student to attend class until his or her records can be obtained or until the immunizations can be obtained. An authorized juvenile justice official is responsible for followup of each student who enters a juvenile justice program until proper documentation or immunizations are obtained. (6)(a) No person licensed by this state as a physician or nurse shall be liable for any injury caused by his or her action or failure to act in the administration of a vaccine or other immunizing agent pursuant to the provisions of this section if the person acts as a reasonably prudent person with similar professional training would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.\n(b) No member of a district school board, or any of its employees, or member of a governing board of a private school, or any of its employees, shall be liable for any injury caused by the administration of a vaccine to any student who is required to be so immunized or for a failure to diagnose scoliosis pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n(7) The parents of any child admitted to or in attendance at a Florida public or private school, grades prekindergarten through 12, are responsible for assuring that the child is in compliance with the provisions of this section.\n(8) Each public school, including public kindergarten, and each private school, including private kindergarten, shall be required to provide to the county health department director or administrator annual reports of compliance with the provisions of this section.

      "text": "Florida moves to kill vaccine mandates; state surgeon general slams them as \u2018slavery\u2019\n'Who am I to tell you what your child should put in their body?' the state's top public health official said.\n- Florida officials announced the state will work to end all vaccine mandates.\n- Florida law currently requires immunizations for several communicable diseases, including polio and measles.\n- The state has recently seen a significant increase in whooping cough cases and a measles outbreak.\nFlorida is moving to end all vaccine mandates in the state.\n\u201cEvery last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Ladapo, Florida's surgeon general, at a Sept. 3 press conference in Valrico, Hillsborough County.\n\u201cWho am I to tell you what your child should put in their body? I don\u2019t have that right. Your body is a gift from God,\u201d Ladapo said.\nVaccine requirements are in state law. Ladapo, the state's top public health official, said lawmakers will \u201chave to choose a side.\u201d To those who don\u2019t want to get vaccinated, he said, \u201cGod bless you.\u201d\nThe press conference was a chance for Ladapo, Gov. Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Jay Collins and other state leaders, including Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas and state lawmakers to appeal to the growing anti-vaccination movement.\nLadapo said the Florida Department of Health, which he heads, will repeal the rules within his purview that require vaccines, and that the governor and the Legislature will work to repeal the rest.\nAccording to Florida law, immunizations are required for polio, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, tetanus and other communicable diseases as determined under rules promulgated by the Department of Health.\nIn a statement, American Academy of Pediatrics President Dr. Susan J. Kressly disagreed with Florida's decision: \"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it\u2019s harder for diseases to spread, and easier for everyone to keep the fun and learning going. When children are sick and miss school, parents also miss work, which not only impacts those families, but also the local economy.\n\"We are concerned that today's announcement by Gov. DeSantis will put children in Florida public schools at higher risk for getting sick, and have ripple effects across their community.\"\nThe state's announcement was paired with the creation of a state version of a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission, which will be led by First Lady Casey DeSantis.\nAt the federal level, MAHA is led by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tasked with investigating chronic illness and delivering an action plan to fight childhood diseases.\nKennedy, however, has promoted misinformation on vaccines in the past, and recently fired Susan Monarez as the Centers for Disease Control director after a dispute over vaccination policy.\n\u201cI really applaud what they\u2019re doing at the national level with the MAHA movement,\u201d Casey DeSantis said. \u201cA lot of these drugs, you don\u2019t need them if you live a healthy lifestyle. If you\u2019re eating fruits and vegetables, you can reverse a lot of these chronic conditions.\u201d\nFlorida also recently removed fluoride from its public water supply. The Florida Farm Bill, which took effect July 1, prevents local municipalities from adding fluoride to their water. Gov. DeSantis has called fluoride \"forced medication.\"\nIn Valrico, he called out pediatricians who refuse to accept patients whose parents don\u2019t want to vaccinate their children: \u201cUnless there\u2019s a really clear reason to put something in, then I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nDuring his comments, DeSantis restated his anti-mask and anti-COVID mandate sentiments, criticizing Anthony Fauci, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical experts over their stance on COVID-19 protocols. Fauci was the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt the time, the governor\u2019s office also sold \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci My Florida\u201d merchandise. \u201cWhen they were saying follow the science, they were really saying follow their political science,\u201d DeSantis said.\nHe touted the state\u2019s decision to keep schools and businesses open in the fall of 2020 and 2021 when other states and medical experts wanted to keep mask mandates and establish social distancing policies.\n\u201cPeople needed a voice of reason and sanity, and the state of Florida filled that void, not just for the state but for our country,\u201d DeSantis said.\nAt the end of the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Florida ranked 26th in deaths per capita, then rose to 10th a few months into the Delta wave in 2021.\nLast year, the number of whooping cough cases in Florida soared. From Jan. 1, 2024 to Dec. 31, 2024, the Florida Department of Health reported 715 cases of pertussis \u2013 an eight-fold increase over the year before, which had 85 cases.\nCurrently in Florida, the vaccination rate for those who have completed all five doses of the TDAP vaccine, which prevents tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, is about 88.1%. Herd immunity for pertussis requires 92% to 94%.\nAs previously reported, in 2024, a measles outbreak in Miami-Dade resulted in nine infections. DOH's response at the time was criticized after Ladapo contradicted federal and medical professional guidance to contain the spread.\nAccording to the CDC, only 88.1% of kindergarteners in Florida were vaccinated against measles in 2023-24. Herd immunity for measles requires a 95% vaccination rate.\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\nAna Go\u00f1i-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida, can be reached at agonilessan@gannett.com."

      "text": "Following national trends, Florida is seeing a spike in COVID driven by JN.1 variant\nPreventative measures like masks and vaccines, as well as tests and treatment, are expected to be effective against JN.1.\nFor the fourth year in a row, the holidays have brought an increase in COVID cases and hospitalizations to Florida. This trend can be seen throughout the nation, with the new COVID variant JN.1 driving the surge.\nAs of Dec. 22, the Centers for Disease Control reported that JN.1 \u2014 a descendent of the Omicron substrain BA.2.86, which hit the U.S. during the summer \u2014 made up 44.2% of all COVID cases in the country.\n\"At this time, the spread of JN.1 does not appear to pose additional risks to public health beyond that of other recent variants,\" the CDC said Dec. 22. \"(The) CDC is closely monitoring COVID-19 increases domestically and internationally and will communicate if the situation changes.\"\nWhile the variant appears more immune evasive than others, deaths attributed to COVID for both this winter season and the last have been lower than in 2020 and 2021, though they're still trending upwards nationally. Still, hospitalizations are in the tens of thousands around the nation. In Florida, that number is lower, but sharply increasing.\nHere's what the data says.\nHospitalizations, emergency room visits trending up\nDuring the week of Dec. 23, Florida saw an uptick in hospital admissions and emergency department visits attributed to the virus. These factors increased compared to the prior week, while deaths attributed to the virus fell, according to the CDC. Here's how that breaks down:\n- 1.2% of all deaths were attributed to COVID, a 25% decrease\n- 1,391 new hospital admissions of confirmed COVID, a 21.8% increase\n- 1.7% of emergency department visits involved a COVID-19 diagnosis, a 10.8% increase\nNational data for the same time period:\n- 3.3% of all deaths were attributed to COVID, a 10% increase\n- 29,059 hospital admissions of confirmed COVID, a 16.7% increase\n- 2.5% of emergency department visits involved a COVID diagnosis, a 12% increase\nDuring the summer \u2014 when COVID levels last surged \u2014 national hospital admissions peaked Sept. 9 at 20,960. They fell to 15,052 on Nov. 4 before beginning to increase again.\nMultiple illnesses circulate this winter What are Americans catching this winter? It's not just flu and COVID-19 anymore.\nJN.1 symptoms COVID variant JN.1 is nearly half of COVID cases in US, CDC says. What are the symptoms?\nHow much COVID is circulating in the community?\nThe CDC reported that for the region including Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, 6,124 tests took place during the week of Dec. 23. There was a test positivity rate of 8.6%, an increase of 1.1% from the previous week.\nNationally, the test positivity rate was 12.7% for the week of Dec. 23, an increase of 0.7% from the prior week.\nIt's important to note not everyone with symptoms takes a test, and at-home tests aren't reported.\nBiobot, a company that tracks the presence of diseases in wastewater around the country, showed the national average of COVID-19 viral concentration in wastewater was 997 per milliliter as of Dec. 23. That's just slightly below last year, when the company recorded a concentration of 1,086 copies per milliliter on Dec. 24, 2022.\nThe 2022-2023 winter surge peaked on Dec. 31, 2022 with 1,160 copies of COVID-19 per milliliter of wastewater.\nSmall percentage of the nation vaccinated\nAs of Dec. 9, only 18.3% of adults reported having received their 2023-2024 COVID shot on the National Immunization Survey despite the vaccine being approved several months ago, the CDC reported. The statistic for children ages 6 months to 17 years was even lower, with parents and guardians reporting that only 7.8% of their children had received a shot.\nVaccines are available at most pharmacies, though some require an appointment ahead of time.\nPfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are available for everyone 6 months old and above, while the Novavax vaccine \u2014 currently the only COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. that does not use mRNA \u2014 is available for everyone age 12 and older.\nWhile the CDC maintains that all three COVID vaccines are safe, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo has called mRNA vaccines into question multiple times. On Wednesday, he called for the FDA and CDC to stop the use of mRNA vaccines in humans, citing safety concerns about \"nucleic acid contaminants.\"\nEven with the newer variants, vaccines help reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death. However, the \"protection against infection tends to be modest and sometimes short-lived,\" according to the CDC.\nTesting and treatment: How to test and where to get treatment\nWhile the CDC recommends testing immediately if you have symptoms, a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases suggested that testing on the fourth day of symptoms may produce the most accurate result. In the study, researchers examined 350 people with COVID and found that their viral load peaked four to five days after symptoms started.\nIf you don't have symptoms but have been exposed, you should wait five days before testing, according to the CDC. If you are using rapid tests and receiving negative results, you should test twice more with 48 hours between each test, as negative results are not always accurate. A positive result is reliable.\nPCR testing generally only requires one test and is the most accurate test available. However, it's no longer free in most cases due to the federal emergency ending in May of last year, and not all insurances cover COVID tests.\nSome Walgreens locations have free at-home PCR tests through Labcorp that do not require insurance. Check to see if your Walgreens offers these tests by visiting their website.\nRapid tests are sold at pharmacies and grocery stores. The federal government offers p to four free tests per household on the Department of Health and Human Services website.\nPaxlovid is generally prescribed through your primary care physician, an emergency department or urgent care, online telehealth or pharmacists if you test positive.\nMy symptoms are mild: Why test?\nWhile estimates vary, the CDC reported in summer 2022 that approximately one in 13 American adults were suffering from long COVID, a condition with a variety of symptoms including fatigue (especially after any kind of exertion), brain fog, chest pain and more. Out of the general population who had previously had COVID, they estimated about one in five had long COVID, with people of color and LGBTQ populations at an increased risk of developing the condition.\nThose with long COVID advocate for testing so there's documented proof of infection in case you need to seek treatment for long COVID in the future.\nTesting can also help rule out a COVID infection and help you decide if you want to seek testing and treatment for the flu, RSV or bacterial infections.\nI'm sick. How long do I have to isolate?\nIf you're sick and think it might be COVID, the CDC recommends isolating at home for at least five days and wearing a high-quality mask if you have to be around other people. If you are fever-free after five days and other symptoms are improving, you can end isolation. However, you should still wear a mask indoors and avoid being around high-risk individuals for at least 11 days.\nIf you had moderate symptoms such as shortness of breath, or you have a weakened immune system, the CDC advises isolating through day 10.\nBecause schools and employers have dropped COVID-19 policies, not everyone can isolate while sick. If you need to be around people, the CDC recommends wearing \"highly protective mask or respirator,\" like a KN95 or N95. These masks can generally be purchased at home improvement stores, or may be available for free through links listed on the CDC's website.\nFinch Walker is the education reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis is courting anti-vax voters. Florida surgeon general's podcast appearances help\nTALLAHASSEE \u2013 Days after Gov. Ron DeSantis opened his second term with a combative speech blasting federal COVID-19 policies as based \u201cmore on ideology and politics than on sound science,\u201d Florida\u2019s surgeon general was a guest on a podcast called Liberty Lockdown.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a beautiful day to be unvaccinated? It feels so good,\u201d host Clint Russell said before starting into his conversation with Dr. Joseph Ladapo, the state\u2019s top doctor who also is a tenured faculty member at the University of Florida.\nWith DeSantis expected in coming months to formally launch his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, Ladapo is emerging as a central player in the governor\u2019s outreach to vaccine skeptics and opponents who now form a stunningly large part of the GOP\u2019s national voter base.\nDeSantis is making his own appeals to this Republican core, which defies most medical advice on the virus, getting the Florida Supreme Court last month to open a statewide grand jury investigation into what he called \u201ccrimes and wrongdoing,\u201d related to the COVID-19 vaccinations.\nDeSantis gets probe he wanted:Florida Supreme Court approves DeSantis call for coronavirus vaccine grand jury\nFlorida top doc a favorite of far right:Florida Surgeon General Ladapo appears on anti-vaccine podcast, promotes medical falsehoods\nDeSantis kept up the drumbeat Tuesday, calling for the Republican-controlled Legislature to make permanent bans on school mask mandates along with government and employer vaccine requirements which had been enacted on a short-term basis in 2021.\nLeaning into conspiracies\nAt a boisterous rally in Republican-leaning Bay County, DeSantis leaned into conspiracy theories, saying there was an effort by the medical establishment, President Joe Biden and the legacy media to \u201cimpose a bio-medical security state on society.\u201d\nBut how such claims will play with Republican voters across the country is uncertain.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people who have concerns and they\u2019re really tired of the mainstream doctors glossing that over and saying everything is OK. He\u2019s speaking for a large group of people out there,\" said Evan Power, chair of the Leon County Republican Party.\nOthers are concerned about the Florida governor's stance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really scary,\u201d said Annette Meeks, a lifelong Republican who heads the Freedom Foundation of Minnesota, a conservative policy group. \u201cWe\u2019ve just become the anti-science party in some states.\u201d\nThirty-five percent of self-identified Republicans are unvaccinated, compared with only 6% of Democrats, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor. Anti-vaccine messaging has become part of DeSantis\u2019 pitch as he gets ready to take the national stage.\n\u201cI have a great deal of respect for your governor,\u201d Meeks added. \u201cBut along with the whole \u2018freedom\u2019 that he cares to espouse comes personal responsibility. That\u2019s the other half of the conservative coin. But some people don\u2019t take that part seriously.\u201d\nGovernor stirs up fading fight:DeSantis to push for permanent ban on Florida mandates for masks, vaccines\nIs it all about the White House?Is Ron DeSantis peaking too soon? The spotlight is on Florida's governor in 2023\nIn recent months, Ladapo has become a frequent public voice of the administration, appearing on hard-right podcasts airing dubious claims about the vaccines and condemning the federal government\u2019s masking, closures and social distancing guidance that marked the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak that is now stretching into its fourth year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so obvious to me, Dr. Fauci is a complete fraud when it comes to communication,\u201d Ladapo told Liberty Lockdown listeners in a podcast aired Jan. 9, taking aim at the now-retired chief medical advisor to both former President Donald Trump and Biden during the pandemic.\n\u201cHis goal is not communication. It\u2019s manipulation,\u201d Ladapo said.\nRecent hard-right appearances\nThe Liberty Lockdown appearance was the doctor\u2019s latest on podcasts which attract a sizable segment of conservative followers.\nWeeks earlier, in a First Class Fatherhood podcast airing Nov. 30, Ladapo urged listeners to rely on \u201cintuition,\u201d when it came to following medical or scientific advice.\n\u201cJust check in with your gut. Who do you think you can trust, and go with those individuals,\u201d Ladapo told host Alec Lace.\nHe added about mask-wearing, \u201cThe best scientific evidence has found no benefit for wearing these in the community,\u201d a statement that contradicts most research and vastly overstates even the conclusion of studies that downplay the effectiveness of masks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just nonsense,\u201d he said, laughing, while drawing no pushback from Lace.\nLadapo also appeared on right-wing podcasts in the weeks leading up to the November election that DeSantis won by 19% over Democrat Charlie Crist, the largest victory margin in a Florida governor\u2019s race in 40 years.\nHe disputed widely accepted views of masking and vaccines on shows hosted by Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an Ohio physician who promotes false claims about COVID-19 shots and wrongly says childhood vaccines cause autism.\nLadapo also appeared on X22 Report, a far-right podcast known for sharing QAnon-related conspiracies and misinformation. He also was on the podcast of conspiracy theorist Stew Peters, who has touted a wide range of false claims about the 2020 election, COVID-19 and more.\nPrevious Florida surgeon general questions Ladapo advice\nDuring most of his appearances, Ladapo praises DeSantis for sharing his off-center views, amplifying the governor before thousands of listeners and lending the credibility of Florida government to suspect claims.\nHis predecessor as Florida Surgeon General, Dr. Scott Rivkees, who served for two years beginning in 2019, has criticized Ladapo, lately for his warning that young men should not be vaccinated against COVID-19 because of possible heart risks.\nLadapo\u2019s colleagues at the University of Florida Medical School last month criticized him for \u201ccherry-picking\u201d data to reach his conclusions.\nMore than 84,000 Floridians have died from COVID-19, while the state has reported about 7.4 million cases since the beginning of the pandemic. At least 1 in 255 Floridians have died from the coronavirus during the pandemic, more than the 1 in 388 resident deaths reported in California, which DeSantis and Ladapo frequently ridicule for tight restrictions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what voice he has with the medical community and if the public is truly listening to him,\u201d said Rivkees, a pediatrician and now professor at Brown University School of Public Health.\nRivkees left as surgeon general not long after the DeSantis administration shunted him from public view after he said at an April 2020 COVID-19 news briefing at the state Capitol that people would have to continue social distancing until a vaccine could be approved.\nDeSantis by that time was intent on reopening the state following a brief lockdown.\nWho is listening to Florida's top doctor?\nOf Ladapo, Rivkees said: \u201cHe has been broadly opposed in his statements and viewpoints by the American Academy of Pediatrics, most medical organizations and many experts. When it comes to vaccine advice, it really has to do with the doctor-patient relationship.\u201d\nDeSantis, himself, had once promoted vaccines. But while the governor quickly emerged as a leading opponent of vaccine and mask mandates, that now has evolved into a wariness about the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines.\nThat parallels conservative media, which has embraced vaccine skepticism. Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson has been questioning the safety of vaccines and airing the views of critics who want them taken off the market.\nDeSantis has found an eager ally and promoter in Ladapo.\n\u201cThe governor supports the work of the Surgeon General in encouraging truthful dialogue about the nature of \u2013 and risks associated with \u2013 mRNA COVID vaccines,\u201d said Bryan Griffin, a DeSantis spokesman.\nWhen Ladapo was hired in 2021, he earned $362,000 annually in his dual roles at the University of Florida and state Department of Health. A request for his daily schedule and detail on his current salary drew no response from the Health Department.\n\u201cHe may have the ear of people who are not vaccinated or probably are not going to get vaccinated against COVID,\u201d Rivkees said. \u201cIt is not clear what impact he has with people who follow mainstream health care recommendations.\n\u201cBut in public health and medicine, we recognize that anti-vaccine messages can be harmful,\u201d he added.\nLadapo has been controversial from the beginning\nLadapo\u2019s national profile began taking shape when he wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal in April 2020, titled \u201cLockdowns Won\u2019t Stop the Spread.\u201d\nLater that year, Ladapo, clad in a white medical coat, went to the steps of the U.S. Capitol where he joined others calling themselves \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors,\u201d opposing measures intended to combat COVID-19.\nLadapo and others in the group supported the use of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, that had been hailed as a COVID-19 treatment by Trump before the Food and Drug Administration cautioned against its use.\nLadapo in 2020 also became a signer of the Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated lifting COVID-19 restrictions on lower-risk groups to promote herd immunity, predicting that approach would somehow still protect vulnerable people.\nOther signers include Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford professor, and Dr. Martin Kuldorff, a biostatistician and former Harvard Medical School professor, who have frequently advised DeSantis on COVID-19 policy, most recently before his call for a grand jury probe of vaccines and their distribution.\nFor DeSantis, heading into what could be a crowded Republican presidential field, a high-profile stance challenging Biden on vaccine policy could prove distinctive.\nIt also may give him some separation from Trump, who led the Operation Warp Speed development of the vaccine and who remains the favorite of many Republican voters for the 2024 nomination.\nFor Republican voters, DeSantis appears decisive, said Power, the Leon County GOP leader.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s speaking to a provable belief that the vaccines didn\u2019t provide what they said they would,\u201d Power said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t prevent transmission and there seem to be some side effects that were breezed over in their implementation.\nBut Power downplayed the role that DeSantis\u2019 possible presidential ambitions may play in his messaging.\n\u201cI see it more that he\u2019s a bold governor who\u2019s taking on challenging issues and doesn\u2019t back down from them. That\u2019s made him a popular governor, and I\u2019m not shocked he\u2019s leading on an important issue like this,\u201d Power said.\nJohn Kennedy is a reporter in the USA TODAY Network\u2019s Florida Capital Bureau.

      "text": "What's new in Florida Department of Health COVID reports after the lawsuit? What's missing?\nIn October, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) agreed to settle a nearly two-year-old lawsuit over COVID-19 data by releasing more detailed information spanning back three years on the state's FLHealthCHARTS.gov site.\nAt about the same time, the state stopped issuing its biweekly COVID reports.\nAfter years of slow-walking or refusing public records requests for specific COVID data and changing the way it counts cases, this is another big change for the state's reporting. What information has been added? Is anything missing? Here's a look at the new data.\nWhat has been added to Florida's COVID-19 reporting?\nThe COVID data in CHARTS now allows you to see data for cases, surveilled COVID-related deaths, and general vaccination status from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 to the latest current numbers, visible by year, month or week. The data is broken down by county, with a state total at the bottom, and can be filtered for data by race, ethnicity and sex.\nThis can make researching trends for specific groups of people easier, just pick your filters and time intervals.\nThe COVID CHARTS also allows researchers to see how many people died of COVID-related conditions by county, something that has been missing from state reports since June 2021.\nPrevious reports only went back a year, so this is a lot of information that's been made available to the general public. All data also is available to download in spreadsheets.\nWhat is missing from the new Florida COVID data?\nConvenience and context. While there is more data available, some information that has been included or curated on the state's biweekly reports (still visible here) is no longer provided or is provided in a different format. That includes:\n- Cumulative totals: You can find interval totals (year, month, week) for the state at the bottom of the chart, but there are no longer cumulative totals provided if you want to know, for example, how many people have died from COVID in Florida (92,292) or how many cases were logged in Sarasota County (126,763) since the pandemic started, numbers that were previously included in the biweekly reports. That information is there, you'll just have to do the math yourself.\n- Percentages: Same here. Easy-to-understand percentages of rising or falling cases, deaths and positivity are no longer provided for you.\n- New case positivity: This is completely gone. Once a measure of the percentage of people testing positive for the first time out of everyone tested, it was a handy gauge of how quickly and intensely the virus was spreading. It's less useful now that most people are testing at home and not reporting the results to the state.\n- Data on booster doses: The biweekly reports included data on first doses, completed vaccination series, and booster doses. The CHARTS data shows only \"Persons Vaccinated for COVID-19.\" There is no indication of the percentage of Florida's population that has been vaccinated, how many people have had boosters, or how many have received the most recent one.\n- Charts: Again, the data is there. But the easy-to-understand charts which allowed average readers to see at a glance the increase or decrease in cases, positivity rates and doses administered are no longer provided.\n- Overviews: Also no longer provided: curated overviews by county and demographics showing cumulative and previous week's cases and vaccination numbers compared to the cumulative total and the total population, or recent and cumulative mortality rates compared to the population.\nThe result seems to be more data available but in a format less convenient for the average reader to easily and quickly comprehend, with much of the context removed.\nWhere can I find data on Florida COVID cases, deaths and vaccinations?\nYou can find a link to the CHARTS COVID dashboard on the state's COVID page at floridahealthcovid19.gov or go directly to it here.\nFrom the FDOH site at floridahealth.gov, click on Statistics & Data in the menu and then on the CHARTS logo on the right, or search for \"COVID.\" It's also linked off the Respiratory Illness and COVID pages."

      "text": "Gov. DeSantis calls COVID a 'woke virus,' praises Florida for avoiding 'Faucian dystopia'\nWINTER HAVEN \u2014 Gov. Ron DeSantis praised Florida's actions three years into COVID for helping to avoid what he called a \"Faucian dystopia,\" while harshly criticizing the federal response and claiming it led to an uncertain economic climate.\n\"We are here looking at this three years out and it's important to say the experts that designed these policies and that were hampering everybody \u2014 they were wrong about almost everything,\" DeSantis said Thursday during a choreographed event at The Fire restaurant in Winter Haven in advance of a widely-expected Republican presidential bid.\n\"Florida, we played an important role over the last three years. I think we were one of the first states to see the experts were getting it wrong and we resolved to charge a different course. We are not going to let this state descend into a Faucian dystopia, not on our watch,\" DeSantis said, referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist who led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1984 to 2022 and helped lead the federal response to COVID-19 under Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\nThe governor, Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and a group of supporters marked the three-year anniversary of the outbreak of the COVID pandemic Thursday morning at the restaurant in Winter Haven's downtown.\nThe virus continues to take a toll on Floridians. Johns Hopkins University estimates there have been more than 7,500,000 cases and almost 87,000 deaths.\n\"The reality is Florida and Gov. DeSantis' leadership and decisions that he made for this state and direction this state went were absolutely correct,\" said Ladapo, who has recommended against children and men ages 18 to 39 getting mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\nJust last week, U.S. health agencies sent a letter to Florida\u2019s surgeon general, warning him that his claims about vaccine risks are harmful to the public.\nMore than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been given around the world with little evidence of adverse effects, the federal health agencies said.\n\u201cIt is the job of public health officials around the country to protect the lives of the populations they serve, particularly the vulnerable. Fueling vaccine hesitancy undermines this effort,\u201d said the letter signed by FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.\nLooking back at COVID: Timeline of Florida, Polk's COVID actions in the first year\nFlorida cases droppingUS agencies can't agree on COVID-19 origins\nReporting COVID'Technical difficulties' strike CDC's ability to report cases, deaths in Florida\nAt Thursday's event, DeSantis criticized Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for pushing 15 days to slow the spread, claiming that was never what federal officials meant. He blamed prolonged business and school shutdowns and mask mandates for a range of economic issues, including a high rate of national inflation, as well as supply chain and workforce shortages.\nThe governor claimed Black Lives Matters protests in the summer of 2020 over the death of George Floyd at hands of Minnesota police officer were supported at a time mass gatherings were not. Not even, DeSantis said, to protest lockdowns.\n\"This was presumably a woke virus,\" he said to applause. \"This took the mask off these people. Clearly, it's absurd you would take that position from a scientific perspective. It was really showing it was more more about advancing an agenda and exerting control.\"\nDeSantis asserted the national economy has not recovered from the financial impacts of the COVID impact.\nHe said Florida's efforts to reopen for schools and businesses, ban vaccine passports and protect employers from what he called \"jab or job\" mandates led to the state's economic strength.\nIn 2020, DeSantis had closed all on-site dining March 20 before passing safer-at-home orders effective April 3. Nearly all business restrictions were lifted roughly six months later by his executive order Sept. 25, 2020.\n\"We saved countless jobs due to our actions and kept businesses alive,\" the governor said. \"We also rescued kids from being plunged into perpetual isolation. We forced the schools to be open in 2020 for all Florida students.\"\nSam and Ken DeBellis, owners of Uncle Nick's Italian Deli in Lakeland, thanked the governor personally for encouraging them to keep their business open during COVID. They said the revenue made during that time helped them reinvest in the storefront, creating an outdoor patio.\nLakeland residents Jason and Jenny Williams also praised DeSantis' lifting of restrictions for helping Jenny's hair salon survive. The couple approved the governor's moves to open Polk County's public schools to in-person or remote education and allowing parents to make decide whether their kids wore masks.\n\"Masks, they did squat,\" Ladapo said, contradicting mainstream medical conclusions on the topic. \"They did not have any substantial impact, we know that.\"\nLadapo said he cannot recommend that anyone receive the COVID vaccines or bivalent boosters released by Moderna and Pfizer. He claimed the vaccine efficacy \"drops negative\" seven months after it is received, causing individuals who received the vaccine to be more susceptible to COVID. This is a misconception based off a Walgreen's publication has been disproven by several scientific health studies, as reported by FactCheck.org.\nFlorida has opposed the CDC's recommendations that COVID vaccination become part of the standard series for babies started at 6 months, DeSantis said. The governor claims the FDA approved vaccinations for young children with \"very, very sparse\" evidence.\nFlorida's Democratic party shot back against the governor's and Ladapo's statements regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccinating children.\n\"Under Ron DeSantis, Florida remains the only state in the nation not to pre-order vaccines for children under five years old. In his extreme war against vaccines, Ron DeSantis has made it harder for Florida parents to decide what\u2019s best for their children\u2019s health,\u201d said Florida Democratic Party Spokesperson Devon Cruz in a press statement. \u201cDeSantis\u2019s extreme approach to the COVID-19 pandemic has left Floridians with less options to protect themselves and their children, all in the name of right-wing culture wars.\u201d\nThe governor and Ladapo pledged that \"the fight\" is not over. The Florida Supreme Court will oversee a grand jury investigation into the vaccines at DeSantis' request and established a Public Health Integrity Committee to discuss aggressive actions to hold federal officials and pharmaceutical companies accountable. DeSantis said he wants the \"true origins\" of the COVID-19 virus unveiled, claiming it is tied to a China lab leak.\n\"We are vindicated, whether or not people want to admit that or not,\" Ladapo said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.

      "text": "'Fear is done': Florida's new surgeon general Ladapo outspoken critic of COVID lockdowns, mandates\n'There is nothing special about (vaccines) compared to any other preventive measure,' Dr. Joseph Ladapo said\nDr. Joseph Ladapo \u2014 a UCLA medical professor who has published controversial articles about \u201cCOVID mania\u201d and is an outspoken critic of lockdowns, mask and vaccine mandates and other mitigation measures \u2014 has been named as Florida's new surgeon general, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday.\nLadapo, who was hired Monday at the University of Florida College of Medicine, said he wants to usher in a new era of battling the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida, one that sets a model for other states to follow.\n\u201cFlorida will completely reject fear. Fear is done,\u201d Ladapo said during a press briefing after the regularly scheduled Florida Cabinet meeting in the Capitol.\nLadapo in USA TODAY:\n- 'America's Frontline Doctors' may be real doctors, but experts say they don't know what they're talking about\n- Coronavirus pandemic: We were caught unprepared. It is too late for shutdowns to save us\nDeSantis said his appointment as surgeon general and his hire at UF were two separate things, and based solely on his credentials.\n\"I don't think anyone who interviewed him knew he was going to be appointed to this,\" DeSantis said. \"It wasn't anything we had done and obviously we wanted to see how that shaped out before we formally offered him.\"\nFor UF, which U.S. News & World Report ranked the fifth best public university in the country, \"to get someone of Joe's caliber\" from third-ranked UCLA is a major coup, he added.\n\"I\u2019m happy he got this job and I think he\u2019s going to do a great job, but that's a big deal,\" DeSantis said. \"Any university would be foolish not to want to get this guy.\"\nLike his predecessor, Scott Rivkees, also a professor at the UF College of Medicine, Ladapo will split his duties between his professorship at UF and his state role as surgeon general and secretary of Florida's Department of Health.\nStepping down: Scott Rivkees relinquishes Florida surgeon general role, returns to academia at UF\nLadapo\u2019s base yearly salary was set at the 50th percentile for a professor of general internal medicine, or $262,000, said Ken Garcia, spokesman for the UF College of Medicine.\n\"We anticipate that the Florida Department of Health will contribute a significant portion of this salary based on the percentage of time he dedicates to the surgeon general role,\" Garcia said in an email to the USA TODAY Network-Florida.\nThe state will contribute more to Ladapo's salary than it had to Rivkees's. Under the agreement, Ladapo will spend 80% of his time as surgeon general and 20% working for UF.\nRivkees, whose contract with the state ended Sept. 20, had a similar arrangement with for the past two years and three months, with UF contributing $140,000 a year to his $239,000 salary.\nNeither Rivkees, a pediatric endocrinologist, nor Ladapo, a cardiovascular specialist, are trained in epidemiology, virology or public health. Yet Ladapo has written volumes on the subject.\nMask battles: Judge shields Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees from deposition in mask fight\nLadapo says science, not opinion, should guide policy\nTuesday, Ladapo said he understood that during a crisis people can be fearful and that state leaders should show compassion. But he added that \u201cfear doesn\u2019t lead to good decisions.\u201d\nLadapo also said he would be clear that the Department of Health draws a distinction between science and opinion: \u201cPeople have been taking the science and misrepresenting it,\u201d he said, hinting at mainstream public health officials who have been setting policy for the nation.\n\u201cYou will know when we are talking about data and opinion. Never lose sight that public health is not just one thing. It is not just about the amount of COVID at a single location.\"\nWhen asked about what mitigation strategies he supported for school children, Ladapo dodged the question.\n\"I\u2019m discussing that with my team in terms of recommendations,\" he said. \"It\u2019s complicated.\"\nOne thing DeSantis said he wants to reconsider is the mitigation policy that a classroom or entire school is quarantined when students, teachers or staff show up and test positive for COVID-19.\n\"When they say schools are closed, it's not because everyone tests positive. Someone will test positive and they send the rest of the kids home,\" DeSantis said. \"That needs to be reevaluated. That\u2019s not how they do it in European countries and they\u2019ve had very positive results. We\u2019re going to be looking at that.\"\nThe news of Ladapo's appointment drew immediate praise from Jenny Beth Martin, honorary chair of Tea Party Patriots Action, a national nonprofit fighting medical mandates.\n\u201cI have had the honor and privilege of working with Dr. Ladapo over the past year, and I have seen first-hand that he is a well-researched, well-credentialed medical doctor with strong character and leadership traits,\u201d Martin said.\n\u201cHe is well-spoken, thoughtful, and as his Wall Street Journal op-eds have demonstrated, he has a gift for communicating medical information to the public in a factual and persuasive manner.\"\n'We need to respect human rights'\nLadapo is a signatory of the Great Barrington Declaration, which expresses concerns about prevailing policies for treating the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt was co-written by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor at Stanford University Medical School, epidemiologist and public health policy expert who has participated in several COVID panels hosted by DeSantis.\nLadapo called Bhattacharya a \"good friend\" but said he didn't agree with everything in the declaration before it was made public.\n\"There is this idea that things are black and white, you have to wear a mask all the time or not, that you have to get vaccinated or not,\" Ladapo said. \"The spirit of Great Barrington is that we need to respect human rights, people have autonomy over their lives and that it is not OK, not virtuous, not right to take away those rights.\"\nHe didn't mention anything about promoting the COVID vaccine, which DeSantis has stopped promoting publicly in lieu of boosting monoclonal antibody treatments. Ladapo said getting vaccinated is a matter of personal choice.\n\"There is nothing special about them compared to any other preventive measure,\" he said. \"The great thing about the vaccine for COVID-19 is that it prevents the risk of serious illness. Fantastic. People get to make the choice about what they want to do with that information.\"\nBut he said vaccination is not the only path to good health.\n\"It\u2019s been treated almost like a religion and that\u2019s just senseless,\" Ladapo said. \"We support measures to good health. That\u2019s vaccination, losing weight, exercising more, eating more fruits and vegetables, everything.\"\nDanielle Ivanov of the Gainesville Sun contributed to this report.

      "text": "\u2018Why does this state hate me?\u2019 Florida bans gender-affirming care for some trans youth\nThe vote by two medical boards has devastated families with transgender children. Some are considering moving out of state.\nThe appointment in January was a glimmer of hope for Julia Sanderson\u2019s 16-year-old daughter.\nIt had been three years since the teen had come out as transgender. Like many trans young people, she\u2019d so far only socially transitioned. That meant growing her hair out and using a name and pronouns that align with her gender identity.\nFor some trans people, the journey stops there, but Sanderson\u2019s daughter wanted to explore the possibility of starting hormones, so they made an appointment with an endocrinologist. Such treatment can relieve symptoms of gender dysphoria, or the extreme distress one can feel when their gender identity doesn\u2019t align with their sex assigned at birth.\n\u201cShe kind of hung a lot of her hopes on it,\u201d Sanderson said.\nBut two panels of doctors appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis quashed those hopes when they voted this month to ban gender-affirming care for Floridians under 18, defying the guidance of most major medical associations in the country and pleas from parents of trans youth and trans people themselves to allow the care to continue. The new rules apply only to new patients, not those who are currently in treatment.\nStill, the decisions by the Florida boards of medicine and osteopathic medicine have rippled through Florida\u2019s transgender community and the institutions serving them, shuttering clinics that provided such care, throwing advocacy groups into overdrive, and devastating families with trans children.\nAnother blow for LGBTQ Floridians: \u2018No one felt safe\u2019: Florida schools, students feel effects of so-called \u2018Don't Say Gay\u2019 law\nMedicaid ban: Transgender Floridians scrambling as Medicaid coverage ban on gender-affirming care begins\nIn schools: \u2018Parental rights\u2019 movement leaves out these Florida parents. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re doing about it\nIn Miami, a clinic serving trans youth at Nicklaus Children\u2019s Hospital has shut down, a spokesperson confirmed, and a similar clinic at Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Petersburg has paused operations \u201cindefinitely,\u201d a spokesperson said. Another clinic at the University of Florida in Gainesville has a waitlist; it takes between three and six months to get an appointment. On Saturday, a University of South Florida adolescent pediatrician wrote on Twitter that doctors were recently told by the institution\u2019s legal department \u201cthat we have no choice but to comply with\u201d the new rule.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable and I fear may lead to so much preventable harm,\u201d Dr. Cam Nereim said.\nLeaving Florida\nSome families are considering moving out of Florida to more affirming states, while others are trying to shield their children from the, at times, inaccurate and, they say, hateful rhetoric around what it means to be trans.\n\u201cIt feels really horrible, like, God, we\u2019re nobody,\u201d said Andrea Montanez, a 57-year-old trans woman and advocate from Orlando who has attended the state medical board meetings.\nIt marks the first time a state has used the medical boards, which typically license and discipline physicians with oversight by the Florida Department of Health, to restrict care for transgender patients. Alabama and Texas lawmakers advanced bills that criminalized such care, but a similar proposal in Florida failed in the last two legislative sessions.\nAfter the Board decisions, Sanderson learned her daughter\u2019s appointment with the endocrinologist had been canceled. Representatives from Joe DiMaggio Children\u2019s Hospital in Hollywood told her only that they will no longer see patients with a gender dysphoria diagnosis, she said. A spokesperson for the hospital\u2019s parent company said officials were monitoring the boards\u2019 proceedings but declined to say whether they were seeing new patients with that diagnosis.\nHer daughter, whom the USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida is not identifying because Sanderson is worried for her privacy and safety, has struggled with suicidal ideations, and they\u2019ve grown worse over the last few weeks. After the initial vote to ban care, Sanderson said, her daughter asked her, \u201cWhy does this state hate me?\u201d\n\u201cThese kids are hearing these things, and they know what\u2019s going on, and the state of Florida is enacting policies that are going on a really dangerous and dark path for a lot of people,\u201d she said, \u201cand everyone else is just looking away because they\u2019ve got all these \u2018freedoms\u2019 under DeSantis \u2026 It\u2019s just ridiculous. I\u2019m furious.\u201d\n\u201cAt this point in time I\u2019m trying to keep her alive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my whole goal.\u201d\nDeSantis focus on trans rights\nTransgender rights have been an intense focus of the DeSantis Administration. They were among the many so-called \u201cculture war\u201d issues that figured into his landslide reelection Tuesday, defeating Democratic nominee Charlie Crist by a historic margin.\nAlong with signing bills that ban transgender girls from participating in female high school sports and restricting how schools can talk about gender and sexuality, DeSantis and his allies have used his behemoth platform to criticize drag queens, transgender athletes and transgender children.\nThe Florida Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration joined the fray, issuing literature arguing that there was little evidence to show that hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender affirmation surgery are effective treatments for gender dysphoria. They point to European countries that have limited gender-affirming care for minors \u2014 but none have gone so far as to ban it outright.\nThe findings led the state to prohibit gender-affirming care for all Florida Medicare recipients, including the estimated 9,000 transgender adults enrolled in the program. A legal challenge against the rule is pending in court, and the same groups that brought that lawsuit are monitoring the ban for minors.\nOther experts have noted there is strong evidence to support that the treatments improve both physiological and mental health outcomes for children struggling with gender dysphoria. That research is why the care is supported by mainstream medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society as well as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which establishes standards of care for transgender people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just striking that after their (the medical boards\u2019) 3-month process they really feel like they have a better handle on the evidence than the specialists in this field who spent years studying the evidence,\u201d said Dr. Brittany Bruggeman, a pediatric endocrinologist who works with patients in the University of Florida\u2019s Youth Gender Program.\nSome experts have noted that state health officials have misrepresented available research, including Australian pediatrician Dr. Ken Pang, whose study was cited by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo to support restricting trans health care.\n\u201cI wish to note that my research was misrepresented and that I strenuously object to my research being used in this way,\u201d Pang wrote to the medical board.\nUnderstanding gender dysphoria\nUnlike the criticism coming from the DeSantis administration that revolves around surgery, the standards of care call for an individualized process, Bruggeman said, that involves specialists from multiple disciplines, mental health assessments, and parental consent.\nNot all trans people experience gender dysphoria. Of those that do, some, not all, pursue puberty-blocking medication and hormone treatment, and they must have a long-standing diagnosis of gender dysphoria to be considered for such treatment. Surgeries on minors, Bruggeman said, are \u201cvery very rare\u201d and occur only when someone\u2019s distress from gender dysphoria is so severe that it impacts their everyday functioning.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a prescribed path, sequence or endpoint,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really individualized and based on the whole team\u2019s assessment and decision-making.\u201d\nFor example, Orange County mom Jen Cousins\u2019 13-year-old transgender daughter hasn\u2019t expressed interest in going on puberty blockers or hormones, Cousins said. In Palm Beach County, Sanderson\u2019s daughter wanted to explore hormone treatment, but the family \u201cisn\u2019t even discussing surgeries right now.\u201d\n\u201cMy daughter wants to wait,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thought of surgery is pretty daunting to anyone.\u201d\nA political process?\nAmong Board of Medicine Chair Dr. David Diamond\u2019s opening remarks at the Nov. 4 joint meeting of the boards of medicine and osteopathic medicine was a plea: The resolution the boards would be voting on includes a carve-out from the ban for new patients \u2014 if they participate in a clinical trial.\n\u201cSo let me be clear,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cAny person who applies that this resolution, if passed in its current form, would ban access to care is incorrect.\u201d\nHe noted the board\u2019s desire to gather more data around the efficacy of gender-affirming care, which all experts interviewed by the board said was needed, and proposed that board members send a request to the Florida House and Senate to collect data from such trials.\nHowever, just minutes later, Dr. Patrick Hunter, the board member who had proposed the clinical trial carve-out, walked it back, saying he felt the treatments were so harmful that he could no longer support them even in the trial setting. Although Diamond pushed back, saying Florida should be a \u201clight to the world to determine the best treatment for these folks,\u201d a motion by Hunter to strike the carve-out passed.\nIn other words, Diamond\u2019s assurance that the board wasn\u2019t banning care became moot.\nThe Board of Osteopathic Medicine took a different route, keeping the clinical trial carve-out in its version of the rule. Board members didn\u2019t resolve the dispute at the meeting, and it was unclear whether clinical trials could commence without both governing boards on the same page. It\u2019s also unclear when exactly the new rules would go into effect.\nThe Department of Health did not return requests for clarification on either issue.\n\u201cFirst you said there wasn\u2019t enough research, and now you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want to do any research,\u201d state Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, said during the public comment portion. \u201cI expect the Legislature to be a political being, not the Board of Medicine.\u201d\nSeveral critics of the rule noted an analysis by the Tampa Bay Times that found board members had donated more than $80,000 to DeSantis\u2019 campaign for governor, although Diamond has said the group is \u201cvociferously apolitical.\u201d Those in favor of the rule included speakers, some of whom were from out of state, who medically transitioned as teens then came to regret it. Experts say such cases are rare.\nAlso in the audience was the mother of a 6-year-old transgender girl from the Space Coast. For two years, her daughter repeated that she was a girl.\nThe woman and her husband, who the USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida is not identifying because they fear retribution for supporting their daughter and want to protect her privacy, brushed it off at first, even discouraged it, but the child\u2019s distress became too much to ignore. She said she wanted to die, that being born in the wrong body was too much to bear.\nThe woman has heard people bristle at such a claim by a child \u2014 how could they possibly know at such a young age?\n\u201cUnless you have a child that\u2019s going through it \u2026 it\u2019s hard to understand. But it\u2019s not pretending to be something for a day, or even a week,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd are we questioning the reality of transgender people? Because there have always been transgender people. They\u2019ve just been hiding a lot more until recently.\u201d\nShe\u2019s read everything she could find about treatment for dysphoria, with the help of her physician father, and has consulted with trans adults about their experiences. All of that research has landed her here, supporting her daughter. But she wonders whether she and her husband will be able to continue doing so down the line, should her daughter express interest in hormones or blockers when she reaches puberty.\nThey\u2019ve put roots down in Florida but are contemplating a move out of state, away from their support system and business.\nShe just wants the state to treat this like any other medical situation, she said: \u201cLeave it to the families and the children who are affected and the medical professionals.\u201d\n\u201cSo much uprooting is going to be caused by this, and for what?\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating that it\u2019s already such a hard situation, and then you have the government making it harder.\u201d\nKathryn Varn is statewide enterprise reporter for the Gannett/USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida.

Messages from local and state leaders about how to respond to the pandemic change almost daily \u2014 a sure sign they have no idea what they are doing. Shutdowns are happening here in California and in New York, and will probably spread to the rest of the nation.\nI spent the past week taking care of patients with COVID-19 at UCLA\u2019s flagship hospital, and the atmosphere there is, appropriately, one of crisis \u2014 like other hospitals around the country. Before we bend to the next reactionary spasms of our political leaders, let\u2019s take a look at what we know.\nEpidemiologists around the world have studied patterns of our social contacts, studied our population density and studied the COVID-19 virus\u2019 transmission characteristics. For better or worse, we actually have a lot of data to work with, thanks to the countries that have already been struck hard. Additionally, epidemiologists have been accurately modeling disease outbreaks for years. As someone who spent extra time in medical school to earn a Ph.D. focused on economics, statistics and decision analysis, I feel confident about the epidemiologists\u2019 projections.\nShutdowns can't save overwhelmed hospitals\nHere\u2019s the problem: Because of the (understandable) fear and hysteria of the moment, few U.S. leaders are seriously talking about the endgame. The epidemiologic models I\u2019ve seen indicate that the shutdowns and school closures will temporarily slow the virus\u2019 spread, but when they\u2019re lifted, we will essentially emerge right back where we started. And, by the way, no matter what, our hospitals will still be overwhelmed. There has already been too much community spread to prevent this inevitability.\nWe don\u2019t have a totalitarian government like China, and we value our civil liberties too much to take the measures (i.e., total lockdown) that would be needed to rapidly decrease the infection rate to zero. This means that, even with shutdowns, the virus will still spread. Unfortunately, this also means that rates of \u201ccommunity immunity,\u201d often referred to as \u201cherd immunity,\u201d will slow. As a result, we will always be vulnerable to the virus spreading rapidly again as soon as shutdown measures are lifted, unless they are immediately reimplemented \u2014 over and over and over again.\nThe only potential savior that would prevent this scenario is an effective vaccine, but the estimates I\u2019ve seen put us 12\u201318 months away from making that a reality. Clinical trials are underway and will hopefully yield effective treatment, but a cure is unlikely. Either way, the models indicate that our hospitals, at current capacity, will be overwhelmed, with or without shutdowns.\nAs Americans, we could, if we set our minds to it, stay locked down for 18 months \u2014 but we won\u2019t. Can you imagine a United States in which children are forced to forgo proper schooling, unemployment and poverty decimate millions more lives, and our economy is strangled into a persistent depression? And all for a virus that, when all is said and done, most people will recover from \u2014 even the elderly (death rates are highest in adults older than 80, at 10-20%)? The lockdown cost will be staggering \u2014 far more costly than COVID-19\u2019s horrific wrath. This terrible trade-off is the path upon which we\u2019ve set ourselves because our public health system was unprepared for a pandemic.\nA real hero: My wife is a doctor quietly doing her job, which is working to contain coronavirus\nPlease don\u2019t believe politicians who say we can control this pandemic with a few weeks of shutdown. None of the models I\u2019ve seen (or history\u2019s teachings, or common sense) supports this as a possibility. As soon as restrictions are lifted, the virus will once again tear through our communities with abandon, until one day (hopefully) we have an effective vaccine. To contain a virus with shutdowns, you must either go big \u2014 which is what China did \u2014 or you don\u2019t go at all. In this country, we hold liberty too dearly to go big; eventually, citizens will push back \u2014 hard.\nFocus on economy and health care system\nTragically, over the coming weeks, as the numbers of people sickened and killed by COVID-19 increase \u2014 and they will \u2014 the resulting fear and the hysteria will be used to try to prolong the shutdowns. This move might work in some states that lean left, but states that lean right will resist. Short of a miracle, expect to see a tragedy unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in generations. Heartbreakingly, people you know will die. Celebrities and politicians we all know will die. Hospitals will be overwhelmed and helpless.\nHere is my prescription for local and state leaders: Keep shutdowns short, keep the economy going, keep schools in session, keep jobs intact, and focus single-mindedly on building the capacity we need to survive this into our health care system.\nWe desperately need more intensive care unit beds and ventilators to give the severely ill a chance of survival: Borrow them, buy them, build them, convert structures to coronavirus-dedicated centers, etc. We must do whatever is necessary \u2014 and do it yesterday. And for heaven\u2019s sake, where on earth are the COVID-19 tests?\nMore on economy: We helped jobless workers survive the Great Recession. Here's what to do on coronavirus.\nAt this point, no matter what we do, we tragically will lose many Americans. Short of a miracle treatment, it\u2019s too late for any other outcome. However, our economy, people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods, and the education of our children should not become collateral damage. We must not let ill-informed, fear-fueled policy compound the casualties of COVID-19.\nDr. Joseph A.

As of February 27, measles cases had also been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Rhode Island, according to the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.\nPalm Beach County has not reported any measles cases as of Thursday morning.\nFlorida surgeon general: Measles vaccinations require parents' consent\nMeasles can cause threaten the life of anyone who is not protected against the virus. It can be transmitted through direct contact with infectious droplets, and can be spread by air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.\nIn Texas, a school-age child died in February, marking the first measles-related death in the United States since 2015. The child had not been vaccinated against measles, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported.\nThe department has reported 159 cases statewide since late January. The majority have involved children, with 127 cases involving patients under 18, Texas state health officials reported.\nDuring a news conference Wednesday in Tampa, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo said state officials have talked with school officials in Miami about the Florida case. The state has provided information about options available to parents, Ladapo said.\nHe noted that measles vaccines are available for children, but added that decisions about whether to give a child the vaccine, or whether to send an unvaccinated child to school, should be left to parents.\n\"There may be more cases and we'll continue providing education and resources,\" Ladapo said.\nRobert F.

      "text": "Florida Surgeon General Ladapo bucks CDC, calls fluoridating water 'health malpractice'\nFlorida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo issued a call to action to Florida residents: Urge local policymakers to stop adding fluoride to public drinking water, saying the practice is tantamount to \"public health malpractice.\"\nLadapo issued his directions from the Fairfax Water Treatment plan in Winter Haven, where city officials voted on Nov. 12 to halt fluoridation of the town's water.\n\"It is public health malpractice, with the information we have now, to continue adding fluoride to water systems in Florida,\" he said.\nU.S. health experts strongly disagree.\nThe Centers for Disease Control calls the practice of adding fluoride to tap water systems one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the last century. Major medical groups, such as the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have also endorsed water fluoridation at recommended levels as a way to boost oral health.\nLadapo, however, said the state would offer guidance to the contrary to every county and municipality across the state to stop fluoridation of community water systems, Ladapo said. Shortly after the media event, the Florida Department of Health sent that guidance:\n\"Due to the neuropsychiatric risk associated with fluoride exposure, particularly in pregnant women and children, and the wide availability of alternative sources of fluoride for dental health, the State Surgeon General recommends against community water fluoridation,\" the FDOH said.\nApproximately 75% to 80% of Floridians are in communities that have chosen to fluoridate water supplies, Ladapo said. The practice started in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and became more widespread during the 1970s and '80s, in an effort to reduce dental cavities and tooth decay. Collier County moved to end the practice in February, followed more recently by Winter Haven on Nov. 12. The City of Naples has taken the first step toward stopping its practice of adding fluoride, with a final vote slated for late November or early December.\n\"I anticipate we are going to see a lot more discussions happening,\" Ladapo said.\nThe state's guidance is based on a report coming out of the U.S. Department of Health's National Toxicology Program. That report analyzed several studies on the impacts of total overall exposure to fluoride. The federal report linked high levels of fluoride in drinking water above 1.5 mg/L and total exposure in foreign countries with lower IQs in children, as USA Today reported.\nLadapo said he was \"appalled\" by the report's findings.\n\"While there is no question that fluoride ... is an important mineral, and absolutely positively can strengthen teeth,\" he said. \"It is also the case fluoride is a neurotoxin.\"\nLadapo said these medical studies have shown with \"moderate confidence\" that fluoride exposure is linked to lowered IQs in young children in areas with higher levels of water fluoridation. He also said fluoride has also been linked to various neurological and neurophysical effects, including hyperactivity, executive function disorder and decision-making issues and other behavioral issues in children.\nCritics of the report, including Winter Haven dentist Dr. Paul A. Palo, have brought up concerns the studies cited were conducted in foreign countries including Canada, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico. Many of these countries have fluoride levels levels in their water exceeding regulatory limits in the United States.\nAshley Malin is an assistant professor of epidemiology with the University of Florida. Malin, who said she's spent over 10 years studying the effects of fluoride exposure, published a May 2024 study on total fluoride exposure of 229 pregnant women living in Los Angeles and impacts on their children at age 3.\n\"It found higher pre-natal fluoride exposure was associated with more child neurobehavioral problems among 3-year-old children in Los Angeles,\" she said.\nMalin said the study found fluoride was associated with neurobehavioral problems that include anxiety, headaches and stomach aches with no known medical origin, and temper tantrums.\nTwo commentators on her published study advise \"caution\" with its findings. Dr. David Gorelick, a clinical professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, wrote that Malin's study did not appear to adjust for a pregnant women's use of alcohol, cannabis or other psychoactive substances.\nLadapo said, in light of recent studies, people have widespread access to several other sources of fluoride in toothpaste, mouthwash and specialized treatments at the dentist.\nMany proponents of fluoridation have argued that low-income families and their children may lack access to proper dental care and preventative measures.\n\"The widespread fluoridation of our water is actually a lot more harmful than the average person is aware of,\" said Dr. Claire Stagg, who was at the event to support Ladapo.\nStagg, a dentist with a 35-year practice in Indian Harbor Beach, said rather than worrying about fluoridation there needs to be a great effort to address the key cause of root decay: poor diets high in processed sugar and improper dental hygiene.\nLadapo said he thinks access to dental care is an important health issue to address.\n\"The answer to that issue is not systemic dosing of the population with an neurotoxic agent,\" he said. \"We have to find better solutions.\nThe Florida Dental Association, meanwhile, reaffirmed its commitment to water fluoridation \"as an effective, safe and affordable method to prevent tooth decay across all age groups.\"\n\u201cDecades of sound scientific research proves the safety and effectiveness of fluoridation and underscores the importance of continuing community water fluoridation for the well-being of Florida residents,\u201d Jeff Ottley, president of the Florida Dental Association, said in a statement.\nUSA TODAY contributed to this story."

      "text": "DeSantis urges healthy, asymptomatic Floridians to forgo COVID-19 testing even as omicron case count skyrockets\nTo stay connected with our comprehensive coverage of COVID-19 in Florida, sign up for our Coronavirus Watch newsletter.\nGov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo said Tuesday they don't want Floridians who aren't showing COVID-19 symptoms to get tested and that they are overwhelming already overcrowded test sites.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have symptoms, you are not a case,\" Ladapo said at an afternoon news conference in Naples.\nThe state's new testing guidelines are in direct opposition to the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that say people without symptoms can spread the omicron variant and that testing is critical in preventing more infections.\nSymptomatic or not?: Should you bother getting a COVID-19 test?\nFlorida COVID testing: Public health experts say state heading in wrong direction on r omicron\nLadapo criticized policies that emphasize people test frequently. \u201cWe are trying to focus on high-value testing,\u201d on those who are at high risk, like the elderly, and people with symptoms, he said.\nLadapo described the state's thinking this way: \"It's not about restricting access to testing, it's about de-programming or de-normalizing this idea that you can't go anywhere unless you get tested,\" he said. \"If you have no symptoms, please don't get tested. You're so unlikely to benefit from that, and you could be harmed.\"\nLadapo and DeSantis used the example of seemingly healthy schoolchildren who have been exposed but are otherwise asymptomatic. Those children, they said, are being unnecessarily harmed by keeping them away from the classroom and their peers \u2014 as well as disrupting family life.\nOpposition to Florida's new policy was swift.\nDr. Frederick Southwick, an infectious diseases specialist in Gainesville and a member of the Committee to Protect Health Care, said in an email, \"Reduced testing will serve to underestimate the severity of the present surge and give Floridians a false sense of security. Masks, avoiding public spaces and most important vaccination are the way to reduce fear and reduce cases. Stopping testing is a way to game the system and hide the severe consequences of the Governor\u2019s and legislature\u2019s laws prohibiting the mandating of masks and vaccines. The consequences of those decisions are now being revealed.\"\nAshish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, tweeted: \u201cFlorida Surgeon General says we need to stop testing and get back to our lives. In fact, with ubiquitous testing, we can keep infections low and safely get back to our lives.\u201d\nEpidemiologist Michael Mina, a staunch supporter of testing who was an assistant professor of Harvard School of Public Health, tweeted after DeSantis' Monday news conference in Broward County: \"WHAT!??! FL Surgeon Gen standing in front of an 'EARLY Treatment Saves Live' podium saying we need to stop testing. EARLY treatment is only possible if we test and diagnose early. Else our treatments are useless. A test is not some conspiracy - it is how we see the virus!\"\nAnd state Rep. Carlos G. Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, urged DeSantis in a tweet Monday to again open state-run testing sites to help expand testing capacity.\n\u201cThere is NOT a shortage of COVID-19 testing supply in Florida. There IS a shortage of leadership. Less testing + less prevention is NOT the answer.\u201d\nPrevious coverage:\n- DeSantis downplays COVID vaccines, pushes antibody treatment unproven against omicron\n- DeSantis promotes Regeneron, a COVID-19 treatment connected to one of his largest donors\n- Florida moves up on Top 10 list of states where COVID-19 is spreading the fastest\nDeSantis calls for monoclonal treatments\nThe governor also called on the federal government to give Florida a large supply of monoclonal antibody treatment, something which earlier in the day he had told media in Jacksonville after a scheduled news conference there was delayed by protesters. One person was arrested.\nArrest in Jacksonville: Gov. Ron DeSantis moves Jacksonville news conference after protest and handcuffing of community leader\nHe criticized the federal government for how it allocates the supply of the treatment and said Florida is not getting its fair share. The state has been allocated 12,000 doses when it recently asked for 40,000 doses.\n\u201cThat is woefully inadequate for what we need,\u201d DeSantis said.\nIn a Tuesday evening news release, DeSantis said, \u201cAfter pressure from Florida, the federal government has begun planning to send 30,000 additional doses to our state, so we can stand up new sites and expand capacity at existing sites.\"\nHe reiterated his position that Florida\u2019s policies of not doing lockdowns, of treating seniors first and making monoclonals available have brought more people to the state, while the federal government\u2019s approach of vaccinations and mandates has failed.\n\u201cThey put all their eggs in one basket and have not been willing to pivot,\u201d DeSantis said.\nThe governor this week has renewed his push for more availability of monoclonal antibody treatment against COVID-19 and says the federal government needs to release its \u201cstranglehold\u201d of the supply or allow states to purchase it directly.\nThe federal government had announced it was halting the distribution of the treatment made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly to states but reversed course after receiving a letter from Ladapo, according to the governor's office. The federal government is allowing states to continue ordering supply.\nBut DeSantis, a staunch critic of the president, says Florida needs at least 30,000 more doses a week than what it is receiving. The state plans to open new sites to treat 250 to 300 patients a day at each site.\nThe governor said the state is ready to open new monoclonal testing sites, including in Collier County, if the federal government provides more stock.\nHe said he intends to make at-home tests more readily available because the federal government has failed to provide them, but he offered no information on how he would get or distribute them. There continues to be long lines at testing centers throughout the state, and many pharmacies are reporting they don't have the at-home tests\nThe antibodies are made in a laboratory and are given by infusion at state-run sites and can be effective against serious illness and can help people recover faster.\nLast summer and fall when the delta variant of COVID-19 was hitting the state hard, the state Division of Emergency Management opened 25 monoclonal antibody sites around Florida, including locations in Bonita Springs and Immokalee.\nRelated: SWFL hospitals have no monoclonal treatments that work on omicron variant\nCases double: Collier's weekly COVID-19 cases more than double as infections surge throughout Florida\nBy the way: DeSantis has prioritized for the 2022 Florida legislative Session\nThe Immokalee site was shut down in late September after it saw a slowdown in people coming for the therapy. The Bonita Springs location remains open by appointment only, Betsy Clayton, spokeswoman for Lee County government, said Tuesday.\nFlorida ranked fourth among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. In the latest week, coronavirus cases in the United States increased 104% from the week before, with 2,833,203 cases reported. With 6.45% of the country's population, Florida had 10.67% of the country's cases in the last week. Across the country, 49 states had more cases in the latest week than they did in the week before.\nAccording to the CDC, 95.4% of all new cases are attributed to the omicron variant.\nThe state has surpassed 4.1 million COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began in March 2020. The state Department of Health on Friday reported 298,455 new cases in the last week.\nOne arrested at DeSantis news conference in Jacksonville\nIn Jacksonville, the governor's morning news conference was delayed after five people demanded to speak with him in the Duval County Department of Health room where it was set to be held. But state staff said they could not be there as reporters watched.\n\"It's a state building, but it's not open to the public, not every room in here,\" facility manager Johnny Lance told the protesters. \"There's private business in some areas and I am asking everyone who is not media to leave the room.\"\nIf they did not leave, the protesters were told them would be charged with trespassing, he said. Then members of the governor's staff tried to set up a later meeting with protesters, but they refused to leave.\nOne protester, Northside Coalition of Jacksonville community leader Ben Frazier, then decried DeSantis' stance on COVID-19 measures, saying he had been \"asleep at the wheel\" in recent weeks as the numbers of people infected and hospitalized had risen.\n\"We come in peace,\" Frazier told officials asking him to leave. \"This governor does not care. He wants to run away and duck his tail between his legs. Why? He does not want to deal with the people.\"\nAll about Ben Frazier: Jacksonville activist Ben Frazier, arrested ahead of Gov. DeSantis' press conference: Who is he?\nPolice officers were called in. Frazier was put in handcuffs and escorted out, his motorized wheelchair brought behind him by officers. Taken to a police cruiser, he demanded to know if he was being arrested and on what charge as protesters yelled \"Shame, shame.\" He received a notice to appear later before a judge on a charge of trespass with warning, and was released before noon, the sheriff's office said.\nThe news briefing was moved to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement building nearby, where DeSantis said he had \"no idea\" what happened at the protest at the original site.\nLocal lawmakers decried what happened to Frazier. Rep. Angie Nixon (D- Jacksonville) said what happened to him was shameful, adding that the people come last in Florida and that DeSantis is \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\"The Governor runs and hides when the people demand to be a priority,\" she wrote in a statement. \"In Florida, peacefully questioning authority gets you arrested. Public service is the people\u2019s business and the Governor must answer for his failings.\"\nThe leader-designate of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Ramon Alexander of Tallahassee, said the hypocrisy of the \"Free State of Florida\" was on full display in Jacksonville.\n\"It\u2019s only free if you agree with him, and you can only attend his events if you are a cheerleader for his political ambitions,\" Alexander wrote. \"You\u2019re free to catch the virus in Florida, but don\u2019t you dare question the Governor\u2019s policies.\"\nState Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only Democrat on the Florida Cabinet and a candidate for governor, called what happened to Frazier and the protesters \"extremely disturbing events.\" She said Frazier was taken away simply for wanting to speak to DeSantis about public health policies.\n\"The Governor should be ashamed,\" she wrote.\nThe Jacksonville news conference was DeSantis' second of the New Year, after the omicron variant surged across Florida in recent weeks. In Monday's Broward Health Medical Center appearance, he was critical of vaccines while pushing for more monoclonal treatments, saying they are not preventing infection from the latest omicron variant. And he repeated that at Tuesday's news conference.\n\"We are not seeing vaccinations stop the spread of omicron; in fact, probably higher incidences in higher vaccinated areas like Miami-Dade than in areas that have less for whatever reason,\" he said Tuesday. \"That's just the reality, so folks can just understand. It is very contagious.\"\nBut since the beginning of nationwide vaccine rollouts, doctors and scientists have emphasized that although the virus can infect inoculated people, they offer the best protection against severe illness and death, even for those who catch the heavily mutated omicron variant. Those with booster shots are the most protected, authorities say.\nDeSantis' last public appearance was Dec. 17 to tell the public his administration's plan to fight the virus. In the week leading up to that day, Florida added an average of about 5,300 new infections. In the past seven days, the number of new infections have skyrocketed to nearly 52,000, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.\nReporters Dan Scanlan of the Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville and Mike Stucka of the USA TODAY Network contributed to this article."

Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday that Joseph Ladapo, a UCLA medical professor who was just hired Monday by the UF College of Medicine, would replace him.\nAccording to the conditions he agreed to upon his return, Rivkees will earn a base salary set at 75% of the current Association of American Medical Colleges salary survey for a professor in pediatric endocrinology, and subject to the faculty compensation plan.\nThe backstory:\n- Judge shields Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees from deposition in mask fight\n- Amid COVID surge, Florida's top health official leaving office\n- Shamarial Roberson, Florida Deputy Secretary for Health, to step down\n- State workers scared over COVID, say Florida agencies have no plan to protect them\n- State surgeon general says fully vaccinated Floridians can go maskless in public, despite CDC\nHow much will Rivkees make as a University of Florida professor?\nAccording to Glassdoor and Payscale, the average base salary for pediatrics professors is around $99,000 a year.\nThat\u2019s a far step down from the $547,000 he earned before he left two years ago to accept the offer from Gov.

He also thanked the governor for \"the opportunity to serve Floridians in this incredibly vital role ... I am humbled and proud to have been part of your team.\u201d\nIncome is not the only thing he gave up to take on the role as the state\u2019s top health professional and medical advisor to the governor.\nHe relinquished his positions as chair of the Department of Pediatrics, Physician-in-Chief of Shands Children\u2019s Hospital, and member of the Board of Directors of Shands Teaching Hospital and Clinics.\nRivkees also lost the Nemours Eminent Scholar Chair in Pediatrics professorship.\nHe won\u2019t be getting back any of those positions or the extra pay that comes with them.\nAs surgeon general, Rivkees earned $239,000 a year as of June 21, 2019, which included $140,000 a year paid by the state for his role as surgeon general.\n\u201cThis salary is fixed, and is not eligible for adjustments or incentives under the\nCollege of Medicine Faculty Compensation Plan,\u201d Dr. Joseph Tyndall, the interim dean of the College of Medicine, wrote to Rivkees upon his departure.\nHe also was not allowed to \u201cperform any direct clinical services on behalf of the College of Medicine,\u201d Tyndall said.\nUnder the terms of his two-year agreement with the state, Rivkees was supposed to spend 80% of his time performing administrative duties as surgeon general and secretary of health, 10% on academic research and 10% on classroom instruction.\nRecords obtained by the USA TODAY Network-Florida show that from April 1, 2019 to Sept. 2 of this year, Rivkees worked a total of 589 days and took 44 days off for vacation and holidays.\nRivkees' time as surgeon general overshadowed by handling of COVID pandemic\nRivkees was noticeably absent from public hearings and news conferences after he was pulled out of a news briefing at the Capitol in Tallahassee over a year ago after saying Floridians would have to wear masks until a vaccine could be developed.\nHe also has been criticized for his silence on government mask and vaccine policies, especially for school children.\nRivkees last appeared in public before the State University System Board of Governors this week to summarize the state\u2019s efforts fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent surge caused by the delta variant.\nWithout using the word \"mask,\" Rivkees noted everyone in attendance was wearing face coverings to prevent spreading the airborne and highly contagious respiratory virus.\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "What is Measles?\nMeasles is a disease caused by a virus that lives in the nose and throat phlegm of an infected person and spreads easily through breathing, coughing, and sneezing.\nWhen someone with measles coughs, sneezes, or talks, infected droplets spray into the air (where other people can breathe them in) or land on a surface (where they can make others sick) for several hours. If others breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.\nMeasles is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of non-immune people close to the infected person will be infected. Infected people can spread measles to others from 4 days before through 4 days after the rash appears.\nHow Serious or Common is Measles?\nMeasles can be serious:\n- About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the US who get measles will be hospitalized (the risk is higher in children younger than age 5 years)\n- 1 out of every 1,000 people with measles will develop brain swelling, which could lead to brain damage\n- As many as 1 in 20 children with measles will get pneumonia\n- 1-3 out of 1,000 people with measles will die, even with the best care\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), measles outbreaks occur in every region of the world. In the US, measles cases happen when:\n- Travelers who get measles abroad bring it into the US\n- Cases spread in US communities with pockets of unvaccinated people\nIn 2019, more than 1,200 cases of measles were confirmed in 31 states. In 2024, 285 measles cases were reported in 31 US states and the District of Columbia.\n| As of September 2025, a total of 1,431 confirmed measles cases have been reported by 42 jurisdictions, with 3 confirmed deaths. 92% of reported cases were among individuals who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. This is the highest number of reported US cases since the disease was eliminated from the US in 2000.\nThe most important thing individuals can do to help protect themselves, their families, and their communities from measles is to make sure that everyone who can be vaccinated is up to date on recommended measles vaccination. |\nSymptoms\nMeasles symptoms include:\n- Fever\n- Cough\n- Runny nose\n- Eye irritation\n- Rash\nChildren with measles often feel miserable and may miss school, with loss of appetite, diarrhea, and sensitivity to any light.\nThe rash usually appears about 14 days after a person is exposed. The rash spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower body. Patients who have compromised immune systems do not always develop a rash.\nPrevention\nVaccination is the best protection from measles. The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and effective.\nIn the US, 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for children. Infants normally get their first measles vaccine between 12-15 months followed by another dose between 4-6 years. However, CDC recommends that any infant as young as 6 months old who will be traveling internationally should get a vaccine before leaving the US, followed by 2 additional doses later.\nAdolescents (preteens and teens) who were not previously vaccinated should get 2 doses (with at least 28 days between doses); those who only received 1 dose previously should receive a second dose.\nAll adults born in 1957 or later who have not been vaccinated or have not had measles should be vaccinated. Those vaccinated between 1963-1968 may have received a measles vaccine that was found to be less effective. If you are not sure whether you were vaccinated, it is safe to get another measles vaccine.\nThe only people who should not get measles vaccine are those who are immunocompromised or pregnant, or those who have had an allergic reaction to previous vaccine (rare, ~1 in a million). Talk with a trusted healthcare professional to find out if you should get vaccinated.\nTreatment\nThere are no specific antiviral drugs approved to treat measles. The goal of medical care is to relieve symptoms and address complications such as bacterial infections. Severe measles cases among children who are hospitalized may be managed with vitamin A under the supervision of a healthcare professional to help reduce chances of death from measles. It is important to note that vitamin A should only be administered by a licensed healthcare professional after a measles diagnosis, as part of supportive care, not as a cure.\nThe best way to help protect against measles is to get vaccinated. Vitamins do not prevent measles.\nIn 2019, the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) convened a group of national experts to clarify the use of vitamin A in treating severe cases of measles. Since then, the World Health Organization, American Academy of Pediatrics, CDC, and NFID have aligned on using vitamin A for the management of children hospitalized with measles.\nUpdated September 2025\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nRelated Resources\nFrequently Asked Questions about Measles\nAnswers to common questions about measles, the most contagious virus known to humanity\nMeasles Alert\nIn this episode, NFID experts offer insights on the recent increase in cases of measles, a highly contagious and potentially serious disease that is now making a comeback due to low vaccination rates in some communities \u2026\nMeasles Awareness Resources and Sample Social Media Posts\nResources and sample social media posts to increase awareness about the importance of preventing measles\nRelated Posts\nInfectious Diseases in the News\nRead recent news of interest from the world of infectious diseases including insights and updates on COVID-19, handwashing, hepatitis, malaria, measles, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) \u2026\nNews Round-Up: Infectious Disease Threats\nAccording to NFID website poll, there are several worrisome infectious disease threats.

      "text": "USA TODAY Network, other Florida news organizations join public records lawsuit\nThe fight is over pediatric COVID data the state said was confidential, even after making the same data available for a year on a daily dashboard.\nThe USA TODAY Network and several other major news media companies in Florida have joined a suit by state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, and the Florida Center for Government Accountability against the state for refusing to turn over pediatric COVID data.\nDuring a pre-trial conference late Monday afternoon, Tallahassee-based Circuit Judge John Cooper granted a motion to intervene filed by the Network, the Miami Herald, the Associated Press, Scripps Media Company, The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Sun-Sentinel, the Tampa Bay Times, and the Florida First Amendment Foundation.\n\"We are pleased the Court granted the news media\u2019s motion to intervene and look forward to providing our perspective on the need for the Department to disclose detailed and timely data regarding COVID-19,\" said Mark Caramanica, a lawyer for the Thomas and LoCicero firm in Tampa, which has represented several news media companies separately and collectively on public records disputes with the state.\nOriginally, Cooper was not going to hear the motion to intervene at the status conference, but changed his mind, overriding objections from the state's lawyers.\nRelated coverage from the USA TODAY Network:\n- Two months later, finding Florida COVID data by county can be frustrating \u2014 but possible\n- School's out for COVID: Infections, quarantines clearing Florida classrooms\n- Overwhelmed by COVID, Taylor County, Gulf County Schools shut down for planning, prevention\nCooper overruled the objections raised by lawyers for the state's Department of Health and Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nSmith filed the lawsuit July 23 after the state officially denied his request, saying the data he sought on pediatric hospitalizations was confidential, even after making the same data available for a year on the DOH daily dashboard.\nHe claims the state is wrongly interpreting an exemption to public records laws, and also is pushing to get the state to resume daily reporting of COVID data at the county level, which the state stopped reporting in June when it took down its dashboard.\nThe lawsuit is demanding the release of the data he requested and resumption of the daily dashboard reports. \u201cAll Floridians have the right to receive critical public health data in a timely manner in order to make informed decisions to protect the health of their families,\u201d Smith said.\nIn their motion to intervene, the news organizations noted that their reporters also use the state\u2019s public records as important news gathering sources.\nThe USA TODAY Network owns 260 daily brands in the United States and Guam, including nearly two dozen newspapers in Florida including the Tallahassee Democrat, Palm Beach Post, Florida Times Union, Pensacola News Journal and the Sarasota Herald Tribune.\nState news media organizations have also filed public records requests for county-level death statistics \u2014 the same data that was provided on a daily basis up until three months ago. Lawyers for the news media have been negotiating with the department for weeks to get that county-level data as well as other information.\nThe news media lawyers must file a legal memorandum on how the exemption to the public records law should be interpreted.\nCooper laid out a very tight schedule for the trial. The state's summary judgment motion is due Friday at noon. Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition and the news media\u2019s memorandum are due next Monday at noon. Final hearings are set for Sept. 29 and 30.\nCooper also said he would likely designate the case as high-profile. That means the public will be able to watch the proceedings on the Second Judicial Circuit\u2019s YouTube channel.\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "Senate Democrats walk out as Republicans on panel OK Joseph Ladapo as Florida Surgeon General\nRepublicans, who make up the majority of the committee, all voted in favor of confirmation\nAfter a lengthy grilling on his merits and qualifications, the Senate Health Policy Committee voted \u2014 without its Democratic members \u2014 to recommend that Joseph Ladapo be confirmed as Florida's Surgeon General.\nFrustrated by what she and her colleagues called a lack of honest answers from Ladapo after more than an hour of questioning, Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book of Plantation said Democrats on the panel would walk out of the room.\n\"We have an extreme amount of respect for process, but we are not getting any answers,\" Book said.\nAfter the four Democrats left the room, Sen. Aaron Bean, R-Jacksonville, called for a vote on recommending confirmation. Republicans, who make up six of the 10 members of the committee, all voted in favor of confirmation.\nAppointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to the position in September, Ladapo's controversial views bucking the accepted wisdom of the medical and scientific community have been criticized from the start by state Democrats.\nAs expected, they questioned him about his qualifications to lead a state during a pandemic and run a statewide organization of 17,000 people, responsible for a wide range of health care issues in the country's third-largest state.\nRecent coverage from the USA TODAY Network-Florida:\n- DeSantis, Ladapo condemn feds\u2019 decision to stop sending COVID-19 antibody treatments\n- No classes yet assigned for Surgeon General Ladapo at UF College of Medicine\n- Florida Department of Health rejects complaint against Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo\n- COVID in Florida: Decoding the data behind state surgeon general's policies\n- A 'trifecta' of 'lunacy': Why Florida's COVID response favors treatment, not prevention\nBut they were frustrated that he gave long-winded, indirect answers to what they said were relatively simple questions. They included his experience in public health administration or details of the current state of the pandemic in Florida.\nHe also gave murky answers about his criticism of the Biden administration and his ability to work with the federal government, and whether he had a plan for ending the pandemic in Florida.\n\"What I hear is arrogance and polite avoidance,\" said Sen. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, adding that Ladapo seemed fond of his own rhetoric. \"This is not a joke.\"\nShe said his answers to simple questions were \"mired in words upon words and nonsense.\" She asked committee chair Manny Diaz to instruct Ladapo to provide concise, answers and Diaz obliged.\nShortly after, however, Book cut the proceedings short, mentioning the long list of bills to get through before the hearing was scheduled to end at noon. Immediately after the roll-call vote, Book was back on the dais presenting one of her bills.\nLadapo says vaccines of little use long-term, and masks not at all\nLadapo wouldn't give yes-or-no answers to Book's repeated questions about the effectiveness of COVID vaccines and masking to prevent the spread of COVID-19, saying those were nuanced, scientific questions that required unpacking a lot of data.\n\"I consider vaccines in the same way I consider other medical therapies,\" Ladapo said. \"What we care about clinically is whether they are safe and effective and that is the lens through which I view all medical therapies.\"\nUltimately, he said vaccines have some benefit cutting down hospitalizations and deaths, but were not effective in preventing infections in the long term, and that masks were not effective at all, especially among children.\nBook also asked Ladapo if he regretted his treatment of fellow Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, who was undergoing cancer treatment at the time when he refused to wear a mask in her office at her request.\nBut he couldn't give a straight yes-or-no answer to that question either.\n\"I have sympathy for her and other people diagnosed with serious conditions,\" Ladapo said. \"Despite the politics of our environment it is a human thing, and I sincerely wish her the very best.\"\nHe added it was important to respect people's personal preferences, including his own. \"When preferences differ, the goal should be to find a mutual outcome that makes everyone comfortable,\" he said.\nImmediately after that exchange, Sen. Bobby Powell, D-West Palm Beach, asked Ladapo if he saw apologizing as a sign of weakness.\n\"The question of apologies or weakness appears to be a personal value question, if I understand you correctly,\" Ladapo said, adding that he didn't think they were related to what people say and do.\nSen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami, asked Ladapo to explain why Dr. Raul Pino, the Orange County Health Department chief, was placed on administrative leave after urging his staff to get vaccinated.\nLadapo said he couldn't comment because the matter was under investigation, but Jones said, \"Your office is the one who released him. Is that going to be a trend of others being let go because they are doing what they think is best for their department.\"\nLadapo replied, \"That particular position was not placed on administrative leave for any reasons that were potentially political or anything other than policies that we have at the Department of Health.\"\nDuring a press availability afterwards, Ladapo said, \"My goal was to accurately answer their questions and I think I fulfilled that goal.\"\nLadapo has been criticized for issuing an order preventing schools from quarantining students exposed to COVID-19, promoting misinformation about the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, issuing a ruling perceived as discriminatory against Black farmers applying for medical marijuana licenses, and refusing to wear a mask in the office of a senator who was receiving cancer treatments.\nThe governor\u2019s office has repeatedly pointed to Ladapo\u2019s pedigree with his medical degree and Ph.D. from Harvard University and his several years as a clinical researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles studying obesity and cardiac disease.\nThe only statutory requirement for surgeon general, a position created in 2007 by then-GOP Gov. Charlie Crist, is that the person be a physician licensed under state law with \u201cadvanced training or extensive experience in public health administration.\u201d\n'Grave concerns': Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo's medical license OK'd in two days\nFast tracked: Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show\nSenate to vote on Ladapo confirmation\nThe 10-member Health Policy Committee was the first stop on the way to a full Senate vote. The Ethics and Elections Committee will have the next opportunity to interview Ladapo in what is sure to become a campaign issue in the governor's race.\nThe three major Democratic candidates for governor have called for Ladapo's removal and for the Senate to reject his nomination, including Sen. Annette Taddeo, D-Miami, co-chair of the Ethics and Elections Committee.\nIn a statement, Nikki Fried \u2014 the state's agriculture commissioner, only statewide elected Democrat, and another candidate for governor \u2014 said Ladapo \"has proven himself time and time again to be anti-science and anti-public health. He\u2019s a quack who shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near our state\u2019s Surgeon General office, let alone running it.\"\nFried said she hopes the Senate can come together \"in a bipartisan way to reject his nomination and protect our state from the dangerous policies and conspiracy theories he and Gov. DeSantis have been promoting.\u201d\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "Corners cut in hiring Ladapo at UF according to Faculty Senate investigation\nUniversity of Florida administrators cut corners in the rush to hire Dr. Joseph Ladapo with tenure in the College of Medicine last fall, an investigative committee of the UF Faculty Senate concluded.\nA report submitted by the committee Thursday found \"irregularities\" that \"appeared to violate the spirit, and in review the exact letter, of UF hiring regulations and procedures, particularly in the vital role faculty play in evaluating the qualifications of their peers.\"\nEven so, faculty in the College of Medicine acknowledged that \"this example was a more extreme version of what often occurs,\" according to the report.\nLadapo was named state surgeon general by Gov. Ron DeSantis within days of his appointment to the UF faculty. Since then, he has pushed back against COVID-19 safety measures recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, further limited publicly available data related to the pandemic, and downplayed the importance of vaccines.\nLadapo fast-tracked: DeSantis mega-donor, UF Board of Trustees chair supplied Ladapo's resume, fast-tracking surgeon general's hire\nWhat does Ladapo do? Florida's surgeon general: What does the surgeon general actually do?\nFinding the facts: Florida Surgeon General Ladapo's COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\nThe Gainesville Sun and the USA TODAY Network in Florida previously reported the pivotal role played by the chair of the UF Board of Trustees, Morteza \u201cMori\u201d Hosseini, in bringing Ladapo to the Gainesville campus.\nThe Ad Hoc Committee on the Hiring of Dr. Joseph Ladapo was formed on Dec. 10 by Faculty Senate Chair David Bloom following news media reports on the hiring process. While the report sheds light on how the process proceeded through three weeks in September, it does not directly impact Ladapo's status on faculty at UF.\nLadapo filled a position that had been open for nearly two years, but the job description was altered \"to better reflect Dr. Ladapo's expected functions\" at the College of Medicine. While that's not unusual, the committee said, administrators also bypassed the regular search committee process.\nA search committee was named, but members of the committee say they were not consulted and didn't participate in Ladapo's hire in any way. One of those listed as a search committee member, Shaima Coffey, hasn't been employed by the College of Medicine for over two years.\nResponding to the ad hoc committee's report, Hessy Fernandez, director of strategic communications for UF, said in an email Thursday evening, \"Dr. Joseph Ladapo was a tenured faculty member at UCLA who received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School, a doctorate in health policy from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and completed clinical training in internal medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the teaching hospital at Harvard Medical School.\n\"He was a faculty member at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine and a staff fellow for the Food and Drug Administration. He has clearly met the criteria for being granted tenure upon hire at the University of Florida, and he received the approval of the faculty in the UF Department of Medicine for tenure.\n\"The committee\u2019s report focused on how the hiring and tenure process at the College of Medicine might differ from the hiring and tenure process for the rest of the university. The hiring process followed in Dr. Ladapo\u2019s case is consistent with the hiring process used in other cases in the College, and the tenure process followed is consistent with the tenure process followed in all of UF\u2019s colleges,\" Fernandez said..\nLadapo offered the job day before tenure approval vote\nUF regulations require that tenure decisions require a vote by faculty in the department. While a faculty vote was taken on Ladapo on Sept. 17, a letter offering Ladapo the job with tenure was dated Sept. 16 and had been requested by the senior vice president for health affairs two days before that.\n\"It is difficult to understand how a request could be made to the President and Provost regarding a tenure application when the unit faculty had not yet voted on the matter,\" the ad hoc committee reported.\nThe ad hoc committee found \"displeasure, anger, dismay, and frustration with the process that was followed in this case. Faculty also indicated discomfort with what appeared to be a hire given preferential treatment on the basis of his political opinions or associations.\"\nBackground check: UCLA supervisor wouldn't recommend Joseph Ladapo for Florida Surgeon General job\n'Grave concerns': Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo's medical license OK'd in two days\n\"Following news of the hire, numerous faculty in the Department of Medicine of the College of Medicine expressed displeasure at the covert nature of the process and indicated that they regretted that they were given insufficient time and information to properly evaluate this candidate,\" the report states.\nIt continues: \"Several members asked to rescind their vote about tenure but were told that was not possible. There was also a request to hold a zoom meeting to discuss possible next steps, but faculty were asked not to convene the meeting.\"\nSome of the ad hoc committee members met with Senior Vice President David Nelson, Dean Colleen Kock and Department Chair Jamie Conti. \"All three administrators felt that the process followed here was customary if not ideal,\" the report states.\nThe report includes more than dozen email messages from faculty in the College of Medicine, most expressing disappointment, dismay and \"embarrassment\" over the process in hiring Ladapo.\nRead the report below.

      "text": "Florida dairy farm identified as source of raw milk E. coli outbreak. Is raw milk safe?\n- Raw milk sold for pet consumption in Florida was linked to E. coli infections in 21 people, including seven hospitalizations.\n- While legal to drink, selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida; it can only be sold as pet food with proper labeling.\n- Despite health risks, raw milk consumption is rising, fueled by online testimonials and proponents claiming health benefits.\nA Florida dairy farm is the source of the raw milk linked by the Florida Department of Health to seven people being hospitalized and triple that number getting sick.\nAt Keely Farms Dairy in New Smyrna Beach, the source identified for the raw milk the Florida Department of Health said on Aug. 4 was linked to 21 cases of Campylobacter and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections, raw milk is advertised for $12 a gallon, $8 a half-gallon (or $12 in a glass bottle).\nWhile it is legal for people to drink raw, unpasteurized, straight-from-the-cow milk in Florida, it is illegal for anyone to sell to people to drink. Raw milk can be sold as pet food, but it must be clearly labeled \"not for human consumption.\" Keely's webpage did not mention pets.\nSevere complications were reported in two cases, the health department said, and seven people have been hospitalized. Six of the infected people were children under age 10, the FDOH said. The cases were all in Central and Northeast Florida.\nThe health department's bulletin noted that \"sanitation practices in this farm are of particular concern due to the number of cases\" and said it was working with the dairy \"to ensure that effective sanitation practices are implemented consistently across every batch.\"\nKeely Farms Dairy did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment on Aug. 7, and its gate was locked.\nInterest in raw milk has been growing in recent years, especially among people seeking unprocessed foods, after a surge of testimonials from content creators on TikTok, mom groups, actress and businesswoman Gwyneth Paltrow, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who insist it's healthier and easier to digest. In June 2024, Kennedy said he \"only drinks raw milk.\"\nThis is despite documented evidence over many years that drinking or eating products made from raw milk can expose people to high levels of a variety of bacteria, including E. coli and listeria.\n\"We sort of forgot that people were dying before we had things like processed foods,\" said Keith Schneider, a food-safety professor at the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.\nIllness from raw milk can cause diarrhea, stomach cramping and vomiting, and severe complications can lead to paralysis, kidney failure, stroke, or even death, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.\nHere's what to know before trying it.\nWhat is raw milk? Is it safe to drink?\n\"In fact, raw milk is one of the riskiest foods,\" the CDC says. \"Raw milk can be contaminated with harmful germs that can make you very sick.\"\nRaw milk is simply milk from cows, sheep and goats (or any other animal) that has not been pasteurized, a process of heating the milk to neutralize any harmful microorganisms in it.\nRaw milk and the products made from it, including soft cheese, ice cream, and yogurt, are an excellent medium for germs, which can come from an animal's waste, skin or udder.\nHarmful bacteria can also come from the area where the animal lives, from insects or rodents, from unsanitary conditions, or even from cross-contamination from dairy workers, and any of that can happen no matter how small the farm is or how clean the conditions are.\nAccording to the CDC, improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other food-borne disease source.\nWhat does the Florida Department of Health say about drinking raw milk?\nAlthough the FDOH has previously warned that \"Raw milk can be very dangerous to your health,\" the Aug. 4 bulletin from the department, led by Dr. Joseph Ladapo, is less harsh.\n\u201cMany people consume raw milk safely,\u201d the bulletin said. \u201cHowever, the producer\u2019s handling of raw milk and milking procedures are vital in prevention of contamination.\"\n\u201cFloridians are encouraged to use this information to make informed decisions about their health and sources of raw milk should they choose to consume it.\u201d\nLadapo, who was handpicked by Gov. Ron DeSantis to be Florida's surgeon general, also has advised Floridians to make their own decisions regarding vaccines against COVID and the measles.\nWhat can raw milk do to you?\nFor many, drinking raw milk will have no adverse effects. But even people who have drunk plenty of it over the years still can get sick from a contaminated batch and experience many days of diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. Some people may develop chronic, severe or life-threatening diseases, including:\n- Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which can cause paralysis\n- Hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure, stroke, and even death\n- Bovine tuberculosis, which can cause infections in the chest, lungs, kidney, spine and brain\nIllnesses caused by bacteria from raw milk \"can be especially problematic for infants, young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised,\" according to the FDA. Between 1987 to September 2010, the FDA found at least 133 reported outbreaks from the consumption of raw milk and raw milk products, leading to 2,659 cases of illnesses, 269 hospitalizations, 3 deaths, 6 stillbirths and 2 miscarriages.\nIn 2014, two people were infected with listeriosis from raw milk distributed by a Pennsylvania dairy, one from California and one from Florida. The Florida victim died, the CDC said.\nWhat is pasteurized milk? Is it safer to drink?\nPasteurization is a process that uses heat to kill harmful bacteria and pathogens in milk, making it safe to drink while extending its shelf life. The process has been used to preserve wine for over a thousand years.\nIn the 1860s, French microbiologist Louis Pasteur discovered that less aggressive, briefer, less hot temperatures would work just as well, and the process was called \"pasteurization\" in his honor.\nRoutine pasteurization of milk started in the 1920s and became widespread in the 1950s, leading to \"dramatic reductions\" in the number of people getting sick, the CDC said.\nAccording to the American Dairy Association, \"pasteurization has made milk one of the safest foods in the world.\"\nIs raw milk legal in Florida?\nIt is not illegal to drink raw milk in Florida or any other state in the U.S., but it is illegal here for anyone to sell anything besides Grade A pasteurized milk and milk products for human consumption, according to Florida Statute 502.091(1).\nCheese made from raw milk may be sold retail to the final customer or food service establishments, but only if the cheese is aged more than 60 days at a temperature above 35 degrees.\nRaw milk may be sold as pet food from farms, markets and health stores, provided it is labeled \"not for human consumption.\" Anyone with access to the animals can use their milk as they like.\nIt's not a federal regulation to prohibit or label raw milk. Federal regulations only prohibit selling or distributing raw milk and raw milk products across state lines.\nWhy are people drinking raw milk? Is raw milk good for you?\nRaw milk fans say it's healthier.\n\"Pasteurization destroys enzymes, denatures anti-microbial and immune-stimulating components, diminishes nutrient availability, denatures fragile milk proteins, destroys vitamins C, B6 and B12, kills beneficial bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth decay, colic in infants, growth and behavior problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis and heart disease,\" according to A Campaign for Real Milk.\nRaw milk tastes better, advocates say, and claim it contains more butterfat, no additives, and it's easier to digest. And while the need for pasteurization was great in the 20th century when tuberculosis, scarlet fever and other diseases were widespread, they say that modern farming eliminates that risk.\nHowever, according to the FDA, multiple studies have shown that pasteurization has no significant effect on the nutritional quality of milk, and raw milk contains no additional benefits but many additional risks.\n\u201cWhen I hear people say, \u2018You\u2019re cooking the nutrition out of them,\u2019\" Schneider said, \"no, we\u2019re cooking the death out of these foods and making them safe.\u201d\nPasteurization is recommended by the CDC, the FDA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, and others."

      "text": "Florida Surgeon General Ladapo appears on anti-vaccine podcast, promotes medical falsehoods\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo recently appeared on the podcast of a prominent anti-vaccine advocate, where he continued to make claims about vaccines that are contradictory to widespread medical consensus.\nMedical experts have said Ladapo\u2019s claims are dangerous, and that his very presence on the podcast \u2014 and other recent appearances on shows promoting falsehoods and conspiracy theories \u2014 gives credibility and support to anti-vaccine rhetoric.\nLapado\u2019s latest comments are part of a litany of dubious claims that have alarmed public health officials in Florida and across the country since he got appointed surgeon general more than a year ago by Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nRipped by doctors: Doctors rip basis of Florida Surgeon General Ladapo's latest anti-COVID vaccine advice\nChildren vaccine opposition: Florida surgeon general defends opposition to COVID-19 vaccines for children before Congress\nThe fast-tracked surgeon general: 'Grave concerns': Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo's medical license OK'd in two days\nA 2021 fact checking: Fact checking Florida Surgeon General Ladapo: COVID, vaccine comments at odds with CDC\nThe controversial podcaster Dr. Sherri Tenpenny\nHis appearance last week was on the podcast of Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a Ohio physician who is well-known not only for her unsupported COVID-19 beliefs but her false claims that vaccines cause autism.\nTenpenny is currently facing an investigation from the State Medical Board of Ohio, which is considering revoking her medical license for ignoring investigators and a subpoena, according to Cleveland.com.\nShe repeated the autism myth \u2014 and many others \u2014 during her conversation with Ladapo. Tenpenny falsely stated that no vaccine has been proven safe or that they can prevent sickness, and that they all cause harm.\nLadapo didn\u2019t correct her.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an obligation to correct information that\u2019s wrong, and he doesn\u2019t the whole way through,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cHe\u2019s the Florida surgeon general who runs the health department. That gives [the rhetoric] credibility that makes it much more dangerous.\u201d\nLate last month, Ladapo made an appearance on X22 Report, a far-right podcast known for sharing QAnon-related conspiracy theories and misinformation, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\nCOVID vaccine and the claim risks outweigh the benefits\nA Harvard graduate, Ladapo has faced ongoing criticism over a slew of issues even beyond vaccinations \u2014 from issuing an order preventing schools from quarantining students exposed to COVID-19 and refusing to wear a mask in the office of a senator who was receiving cancer treatments.\nLast March, he advised against vaccinating children ages 5 to 17. In June, he advised against inoculating children younger than 5, saying the risks outweigh benefits. Florida was the only state to block pediatricians this past summer from preordering COVID shots for children, infuriating parents statewide.\nLadapo said last month that he wanted men younger than 40 to avoid the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 shots. He cited a non peer-reviewed \u201canalysis\u201d done by unnamed authors from the state Health Department, claiming those men faced higher risks of dying from heart problems after inoculation.\nDoctors and scientists, as well as the federal government, called out Ladapo\u2019s advice, saying the \u201canalysis\u201d it\u2019s based upon does not support his conclusion.\nOn Tenpenny\u2019s podcast, Ladapo claimed that the risks of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines outweigh the benefits for \u201cmost people.\u201d\nSalmon said having such a high-ranking government official making such statements is dangerous.\n\u201cIt's inconsistent with the science, it gives credence it doesn't deserve and it's going to scare people,\u201d he said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizes on its website that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, with millions of U.S. residents having received them \u201cunder the most intense safety monitoring in US history.\u201d\nIt recommends the vaccine for everyone six months or older and boosters for everyone five years or older.\nSerious side effects following vaccination are extremely rare, the CDC says, and the benefits outweigh the risks.\nMore than a million lives were saved during the first year of COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States, according to the Commonwealth Fund. To date, more than 82,000 people in Florida have died from the deadly virus.\nA U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report showed that vaccinations led to 300,000 fewer deaths among Medicare enrollees in 2021.\nDoctors can\u2019t be \u2018rehabilitated\u2019\nDespite being the head of Florida\u2019s Department of Health, Ladapo bashed a majority of the nation\u2019s physicians for their vaccine beliefs, saying they cannot separate themselves from their ideologies and politics.\n\u201cOur colleagues, for the most part, can't be brought back into alignment with reality,\u201d Ladapo said on the podcast. \u201cI don't have any faith that most of our physician colleagues, sadly, can be rehabilitated.\u201d\nTenpenny went so far as to compare current doctors with those in Nazi Germany who participated in or didn't oppose the mass killing of and experimentation on people, namely Jews, citing a passage written into the first page of the foreword of Ladapo's own book, which he promoted on the podcast.\nVaccine resistance movement leader Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote the foreword.\n\"I know a lot of people calling for Nuremberg 2.0, and I can't say I disagree with that,\" Tenpenny said, referring to the investigation of Nazi leaders for war crimes.\n\"I mean seriously,\" she added, after Ladapo snickered.\n\"No, I hear you,' he said, smiling.\nSix million Jewish people were killed during the Holocaust.\nSalmon said he found the comparison terrible.\n\u201cI lost a lot of family in concentration camps, so I found the comparisons, if they\u2019re not relevant, to be offensive,\" he said.\nDallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum said in a statement that it \"deplores the resurgence of comparisons to Hitler and the Nazis by those unhappy with regulations issued during the COVID-19 emergency.\"\nSalmon said the deep conspiracy promoted during the podcast that public health officials are using COVID-19 to try to take away liberties creates a whole ideology full of misinformation.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got all these people living in fear, so they\u2019re not thinking clearly,\u201d he said.\nBryan Griffin, spokesperson for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said in an email that the office hadn\u2019t watched the interview.\n\u201cBut we support the work of the surgeon general to utilize data and have open conversations about COVID-19 policymaking,\u201d Griffin said.\nWeesam Khoury, spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health, declined to comment on the podcast.\nThe Department does not manage interviews involving Dr. Ladapo\u2019s personal publication,\u201d Khoury said.\nLadapo's book, \u201cTranscend Fear: A Blueprint for Mindful Leadership in Public Health,\" was published in August.\nUSA Today Network-Florida government accountability reporter Douglas Soule is based in Tallahassee, Fla.

      "text": "Joe Ladapo, Florida's new surgeon general, receives 52% raise over his predecessor\nLadapo\u2019s salary marks a $123,000 bump over his predecessor, Scott Rivkees\nFlorida\u2019s new Health Secretary, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, will make $362,000 a year \u2014 his combined pay from the Department of Health and the University of Florida, where he is a professor of general internal medicine.\nLadapo\u2019s salary marks a $123,000 bump over that of his more experienced predecessor, Scott Rivkees, during his tenure. The position also holds the titles of surgeon general and state health officer.\nIt\u2019s also about $50,000 more than the $319,000 a year Ladapo made as a research professor at the University of California Los Angeles.\nRead more:\n- New Florida surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo stands apart, agrees with governor on COVID policy\n- 'Fear is done': Florida's new surgeon general outspoken critic of COVID lockdowns, mandates\n- Scott Rivkees relinquishes Florida surgeon general role, returns to academia at UF\nLadapo holds controversial views outside the mainstream of the medical community on vaccinations and masking, but those views are in line with Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nWhen it first hired Ladapo on Sept. 20, the UF College of Medicine announced it would pay Ladapo $262,000 a year, with the expectation that the state would contribute a large portion of that salary as compensation for his time at the DOH, UF Health spokesman Ken Garcia said.\nAt the time, however, Garcia was unable to confirm how much the state would be contributing.\nUncertainty over Ladapo\u2019s salary was cleared up with the release late Friday of the employee interchange contract between UF and the Department of Health for his services, provided under a public records request filed by the USA TODAY Network\u2013Florida. The request was made Sept. 24, three days after the contract was signed.\nUnder the agreement, the DOH is paying UF $37,500 each quarter or $150,000 a year.\n\u201cThis is a contribution and not in addition to his UF salary,\u201d Garcia said via email Monday.\nThe state is paying an additional $100,000 a year directly paying Ladapo, DOH spokeswoman Weesam Khoury said. That brings the total DOH is contributing to $250,000 a year, the most allowed for that position under raises for agency heads recently approved by the Florida Legislature.\nFlorida law authorizes the governor to enter into employee interchange agreements with a public institution of higher learning to fill appointed offices in the executive branch. The surgeon general serves at the pleasure of the governor and must be confirmed by the state Senate.\nDeSantis is the first governor since the surgeon general position was created under Charlie Crist to select surgeon generals who were simultaneously professors at state universities.\nLadapo graduated from Harvard Medical School in 2008, after brief stints at the Food and Drug Administration and New York University. He was an associate professor in residence at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine since 2016 when DeSantis tapped him to replace Rivkees.\nThe contract between UF and the DOH is similar to the one for Rivkees, who was also a professor at UF College of Medicine.\nRivkees, who received his medical degree from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and has post-doctoral training in neuroscience from Harvard, has over 40 years of experience in medicine and academia. He was chair of the Department of Pediatrics at UF from 2012 until his appointment as surgeon general in 2019.\nRivkees' contract with the state ended Sept. 20. He received $239,000 a year, with $140,000 a year coming from the state. It was a considerable cut from his previous salary of $547,000 a year at UF, where he held several positions, including chairman of pediatrics.\nRivkees had made few public appearances since last April. That's when he was pulled out of a press briefing at the Capitol after saying people would probably need to wear masks until a COVID-19 vaccine could be created and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nLadapo is now the second surgeon general and state health officer to serve under DeSantis. Like his predecessor, Ladapo will split his duties 20-80 between UF and DOH.\nNeither Rivkees, a pediatric endocrinologist, nor Ladapo, a cardiovascular specialist, are trained in epidemiology, virology or public health.\nYet Ladapo has written volumes on the subject. The Harvard Medical School grad has written over a dozen articles in the Wall Street Journal, USA TODAY, and the New York Daily News expressing views that are controversial.\nThose include promoting the benefits of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin against COVID, and criticizing the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine, mask mandates and lockdowns.\nHe also has been associated with extremist groups including America's Frontline Doctors, a right-wing group known for spreading misinformation about the pandemic, and the Tea Party Patriots Action, a conservative anti-mandate group.\nHis first act as surgeon general came a day after his appointment, when he issued an emergency rule that took away school authority to quarantine students exposed to those who tested positive for COVID-19, leaving the decision to parents.\nJeffrey Schweers is a capital bureau reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida.

      "text": "Why Florida hasn't been reporting COVID cases and deaths to the CDC\nFlorida health officials have paused reporting COVID-19 infections and deaths to the federal government for the third time in the past five weeks. The state\u2019s COVID hospitalizations, meanwhile, have dropped to an 11-month low.\nFlorida's official case count and death toll remain unchanged since March 31 due to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanding its definition of a COVID case, a state Health Department representative said Friday.\nThe CDC said in late February it would include positive results from tests it had not accepted before. This includes tests performed on the dead. It can also include over-the-counter tests.\nPreviously: Florida COVID-19 caseload doubles in late March\nA mystery: 16,000 previously uncounted COVID cases added to Florida's total\nEarlier last month: The CDC can't report updated COVID numbers. Here's what that complicates\n\"To adapt to the case definition change, the reporting protocol must also change,\" Florida Department of Health spokeswoman Nikki Whiting said Friday in an email. \"Reporting will resume soon when the system is updated.\"\nNeither the department nor the CDC could be immediately reached late Friday afternoon to give further details on how the new definition impeded Florida's ability to report COVID cases and deaths to the CDC.\nFlorida published its last biweekly COVID report March 31. Florida logged more than 26,000 new cases in the two weeks leading up to that date, more than double the two weeks before then.\nState health officials did not share statistics with the CDC during the two weeks ending March 31. The federal agency also lacked Florida statistics for the week ending March 9.\nThe CDC said on March 23 it added about 16,000 infections to Florida\u2019s case count it had not previously recorded.\nHospitalizations at 11-month low\n940 hospital patients Friday, the fewest since May 1, and less than one-tenth as many as mid-January.

      "text": "Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine recipients are still human; vaccine doesn't affect DNA\nThe claim: COVID-19 vaccine recipients are no longer human\nAlmost two years after COVID-19 vaccines were granted emergency authorization, about 80% of the people in the U.S. have received at least one dose, and 68% are considered fully vaccinated by one measure. But vaccine hesitancy and refusal continue, powered in part by misinformation on social media.\nVaccine skeptics frequently (and falsely) claim the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines alter a recipient\u2019s DNA, a persistent claim that USA TODAY has debunked before.\nA viral Oct. 9 Instagram post takes this claim further and falsely asserts that those who received a COVID-19 vaccination are technically no longer human. The post was liked more than 5,000 times in a few weeks.\nThe post features a video that shows social media influencer Maria Zee interviewing lawyer Todd Callender, a vaccine opponent. At one point, Callender says that humans who received the vaccine have had their DNA genetically modified to the point that they are no longer human, but are instead \"homoborgensis,\" and therefore have no human rights. He claims the term \"homoborgensis\" comes from a paper published by NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center.\nThat's ludicrous on several levels. No such paper from Langley exists, as a spokesperson confirmed the agency does not do even do research on mRNA vaccines and DNA. And manufacturers, researchers and health organizations unanimously agree the mRNA technology used in vaccines does not alter DNA \u2013 meaning recipients are still very much human.\nUSA TODAY reached out to Zee and multiple users who shared posts with clips of the interview for comment. One responded by saying he was just raising a question about the claim, not endorsing it.\nFollow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks\nNo such Langley Research Center paper, says NASA spokesperson\nIn the viral interview, Callender claims the term \"homoborgenesis\" comes from a paper on \u201cfifth-generation warfare\u201d from NASA's Langley Research Center. But NASA has never published such a paper, according to spokesperson April Phillips.\nThe Langley Research Center focuses on aviation, atmospheric science and space exploration technology, according to its website. A search of NASA\u2019s website found no results for the term \"homoborgenesis.\"\n\u201cThere is zero truth to these wacky claims,\u201d Phillips, the news chief for the center, said in an email to USA TODAY. \u201cThere is no such paper, and that is not an area of research focus for NASA Langley Research Center. We have no idea how this claim began circulating, but it is patently false.\"\nmRNA vaccines cannot change DNA\nThere is also no evidence the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines can interact with or alter the DNA of recipients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe CDC's website notes that the genetic material in the mRNA vaccines cannot enter the nucleus of cells, where DNA is found. The mRNA in vaccines is quickly broken down after it teaches the body to make a protein that triggers an immune response to fight COVID-19.\nDr. Paul Offit of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia said in a video that a series of impossible occurrences would have to happen for mRNA to alter DNA. First, the mRNA would need a nuclear signal to be able to get through the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of a cell. Then, it would need to work with the enzyme reverse transcriptase to be converted into DNA. Finally, it would need to use the enzyme integrase to be able to work itself into the DNA. The vaccine contains none of those components.\n\u201cThe chance of that happening is not small,\" he says in the video. \"It is zero.\"\nAFP has also debunked the viral claim.\nOur rating: False\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine are no longer human. There is no NASA research paper that suggests this, contrary to claims by the social media post in question. And the mRNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines does not and cannot DNA, according to medical experts.\nOur fact-check sources:\n- USA TODAY, May 28, 2021, Fact check: Moderna executive did not say mRNA vaccines alter recipient's DNA\n- USA TODAY, Aug. 5, 2021, Fact check: 6 of the most persistent misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccines\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accessed Oct. 31, COVID Data Tracker: Vaccinations in the US\n- April Phillips, Oct. 19, E-mail exchange with USA TODAY\n- Langley Research Center, accessed Oct. 26, About NASA Langley\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accessed Oct. 26, Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines\n- Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care, May 10, Is it true?

      "text": "Medical experts 'profoundly concerned' as DeSantis looks to end vaccine requirements\n'This decision could have severe and potentially deadly repercussions for children and vulnerable adults,' one critic said.\n- Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced plans to work with the state Legislature to repeal vaccine mandates.\n- Medical organizations, including UF Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have voiced strong opposition to the move, emphasizing that vaccines are safe and essential.\n- Florida law currently requires immunizations for diseases like polio, measles, and tetanus for children attending school.\nHours after Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced the Department of Health and the Legislature would work hand-in-hand to repeal vaccine mandates in the state, national organizations, state university medical centers and former Florida officials came out against the move.\nLadapo has been Florida's surgeon general since 2021 and is also a professor of medicine at the University of Florida. But the university's academic health center, UF Health, stood firm in a statement that vaccines are \"safe\" and \"essential.\"\n\"Public health and safety is a shared responsibility,\" the institution said in a statement. \"The overwhelming consensus of the medical and public health communities show that vaccines are among the most studied and scrutinized medical interventions in history.\n\"They are proven to be safe, effective, and essential in preventing the spread of many serious infectious diseases,\" it added. \"Following evidence-based practices regarding vaccines and other care decisions are best made in consultation with your health care professional.\"\nConservative reaction was largely positive, with many framing Ladapo's stance as a refusal, as one person put it, to \"bow to (Big) Pharma or the bureaucrats.\"\nFor example, Dr. Simone Gold \u2013 founder and President of America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, the far-right group formed to oppose COVID restrictions \u2013 posted, \"This is real leadership \u2014 defying Pharma\u2019s coercion and restoring true medical freedom.\"\nFlorida law mandates many vaccinations against childhood illnesses\nAccording to Florida law, immunizations are required for polio, diphtheria (a bacterial infection), rubeola (measles), rubella (a viral infection, also called German measles), pertussis (whooping cough), mumps, tetanus and other communicable diseases as determined under rules promulgated by the Department of Health.\nLadapo, who heads the Department of Health, said he will repeal the rules within his purview that require vaccines, and that the governor and the Legislature will work to repeal the rest.\n\"Why are they doing this? I don't know,\" Dr. Scott Rivkees, Ladapo's immediate predecessor as surgeon general told the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida. \"The role of government is a government of the people and for the people, and how this is for the people is head wagging.\"\nRivkees quit in September 2021 after being shunned by Gov. Ron DeSantis for encouraging COVID-19 precautions when the governor wanted little focus on preventive measures.\nHe said this isn't the first time Ladapo has defied expert medical advice, citing a measles outbreak in South Florida in 2024 that sickened nine people.\nLadapo said parents and guardians could decide whether to send their children back to school instead of requiring an isolation period, a statement that conflicted with federal and medical professional recommendations that children from the school should remain at home to prevent the spread of measles.\n\"More than 200 students did not go to school because the parents did not feel safe sending their children to school even though their children were vaccinated,\" said Rivkees, now a professor of practice at the Brown University School of Public Health. \"This will lead to a situation where you're going to have more public confusion, you're going to have more children who are going to be out of school when you have an outbreak or a case at school, which is predictably going to happen more and more.\n\"More children are going to suffer educational losses and illnesses which could have been prevented,\" he added.\nDeSantis' and Ladapo's announcement at a press conference on Sept. 3 was paired with the creation of a state version of a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission, which will be led by First Lady Casey DeSantis. At the federal level, MAHA is led by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tasked with investigating chronic illness and delivering an action plan to fight childhood diseases.\nKennedy, however, has promoted misinformation on vaccines in the past, and recently fired Susan Monarez as the Centers for Disease Control director after a dispute over vaccination policy. At the press conference, DeSantis joked Ladapo now should be considered for the CDC director's position.\nFlorida vaccine guidance: Pediatricians 'profoundly concerned,' doctor says\nDr. Lisa Gwynn, a past president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said she is \"profoundly concerned.\"\n\"This decision could have severe and potentially deadly repercussions for children and vulnerable adults,\" she said.\nGwynn, who practices in South Florida, said vaccinations are one of the most effective measures for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. They not only protect those who receive them but also safeguard individuals who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\n\"Removing these mandates could lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases, putting countless lives at risk,\" she told the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida.\nFor example, in Florida, the vaccination rate for those who have completed all five doses of the TDAP vaccine, which prevents tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, is about 88.1%. Herd immunity for pertussis requires 92% to 94%.\nLast year, the number of whooping cough cases in Florida soared. From Jan. 1, 2024 to Dec. 31, 2024, the Florida Department of Health reported 715 cases of pertussis \u2013 an eight-fold increase over the year before, which had 85 cases.\nOn the national level, Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said every family should have access to immunizations because illnesses not only affect children but also their families, and therefore the workforce and local economy.\n\"We are concerned that today's announcement by Gov. DeSantis will put children in Florida public schools at higher risk for getting sick, and have ripple effects across their community,\" Kressly said.\nAnd Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, speaking on behalf of the American Medical Association, said the group \u201cstrongly opposes Florida\u2019s plan to end all vaccine mandates, including those required for school attendance.\u201d\n\u201cThis unprecedented rollback would undermine decades of public health progress and place children and communities at increased risk for diseases such as measles, mumps, polio, and chickenpox resulting in serious illness, disability, and even death,\u201d said Fryhofer, a board-certified physician of internal medicine and member of the AMA Board of Trustees. \u201cWhile there is still time, we urge Florida to reconsider this change to help prevent a rise of infectious disease outbreaks that put health and lives at risk.\u201d\nDemocrats speak out, call for governor to fire Ladapo\nFlorida Democrats also criticized the move by Ladapo and DeSantis, calling the move to repeal all vaccination requirements \"ridiculous\" and \"reckless.\"\n\"Republicans have gone from entertaining anti-science conspiracy theories to fully endorsing an anti-science health policy,\" Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman of Boca Raton said in a statement.\n\"As a member of the Senate Health Policy Committee, I\u2019ll be doing everything in my power to protect our kids from these reckless attempts to harm them.\u201d\nDemocratic candidate for governor David Jolly even called on the governor to fire Ladapo. He called the announcement \"dangerous and deeply irresponsible.\"\n\"For generations, vaccines have protected kids, families, and schools from outbreaks of preventable diseases. Stripping away these protections, puts politics ahead of science and needlessly endangers the health of our communities. Florida families deserve leaders who will put the safety of our children first and not gamble with their futures,\u201d Jolly said in a news release.\nHouse Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell of Tampa said the DeSantis and Ladapo plan was \"stunningly reckless.\"\n\"I encourage everyone to read about the horrifying effects of these diseases,\" Driskell said in a press release.\n\"Polio can paralyze muscles, measles can cause pneumonia and brain swelling, and both can kill. Hepatitis B destroys your liver. Chicken pox causes high fever and a painful rash. These diseases devastated families and stole lives for years before vaccines were developed to protected us. They\u2019re all preventable, but only if our kids take the vaccines.\"\nEditor's note \u2014 The day after this story published online, a UF Health spokesperson clarified that its statement was not from the CEO, but rather from the institution. The spokesperson described an internal error in which the statement was mistakenly attributed to the CEO.\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\nAna Go\u00f1i-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY Network \u2013 Florida, can be reached at agonilessan@gannett.com."

      "text": "COVID reporting timeline from 2020 to now: How Florida changed what it tells us about cases\nAfter a two-year battle over COVID public records, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) settled a nearly two-year-old lawsuit in October and released information spanning the entire duration of the pandemic on the state's FLHealthCHARTS.gov site.\nIt's just the latest change in how the state reports COVID counts after years of slow-walking or refusing public records requests for specific COVID data.\nHere's how the reporting has changed during the pandemic.\nHow has COVID reporting in Florida changed?\nMarch 2020, Reporting begins: When the virus became widespread, the FDOH began issuing a comprehensive daily report of cases and deaths, with lists of cases with each person\u2019s age, gender, location and date of testing, hospitalization numbers and numbers of deaths by county and even by city. The report also included information on cases and deaths in longterm care facilities, assisted living centers, group homes, and correctional facilities. The state also created a COVID dashboard on the FDOH site.\nMay 2020, Rebekah Jones fired: The FDOH scientist responsible for creating the state's COVID dashboard, Rebekah Jones, claims she was fired for refusing to \"manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.\" She built her own coronavirus dashboard and began talking to national media about state pressure to cook the books.\nAugust 2020, MEs allowed to skip reporting: The state tells medical examiners they can stop reporting COVID deaths due to the huge backlog.\nSeptember 2020, School reports begin: The state begins publishing pediatric and school-related cases, but the numbers are inconsistent with what schools were self-reporting.\nDecember 2020, Rebekah Jones raid: Police raid Rebekah Jones' home and seize all her \"hardware and tech\" after showing her a warrant based on a complaint filed by the Florida Department of Health as part of an investigation regarding what they said was unauthorized access to a DOH messaging system. Jones said it was to hamper her own COVID data updates and take her \"evidence of corruption at the state level.\"\nAfter video of the raid goes viral, DeSantis lashes out at Jones, calling her \"a darling of some corners of the fever swamps.\"\nJanuary 2021, Insufficient data: The FDOH declines requests for data regarding demographics of cases and deaths at a time when national reporting shows that Black people, and other people of color, are at higher risk during the pandemic, with a spokesperson saying it wasn't available. That data was later included in full after a lawsuit.\nWant public records? \u2018So sue me\u2019 seems to be state\u2019s attitude, First Amendment experts say\nJune 2021, Florida stops daily reports: The FDOH took down its COVID dashboard and stopped sending reports daily, saying that cases had \"significantly decreased over the past year\" and the state was \"returning to normal,\" according to DeSantis' then-press secretary Christina Pushaw.\nInstead, it switched to a weekly update, the first state to do so. These reports were far less detailed, without the names of facilities with infections, school-related numbers or numbers of deaths by county. This came the month after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order lifting all local COVID restrictions. Then the deadly delta variant hit.\nJuly 2021, COVID surge, lawsuit: By the next month, cases had surged again as the highly transmissible variant spread like wildfire across the nation, leading to the then-highest numbers for the nation yet. In May 2021, Florida reported 88,545 cases and 907 deaths. In July it reported 295,302 cases and 2,081 deaths.\nDeSantis signed an order that month \"protecting the rights of parents\" that prohibited local school districts from implementing COVID-19 safeguards, including mask requirements, and threatened to cut funding and even salaries for those who go against his order. At the time, Florida was leading the nation with 20% of all new COVID infections.\nThen-state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, and the Florida Center for Government Accountability sued the state of Florida for refusing to turn over pediatric COVID data. The state claimed it was confidential, although it had been including exactly that data previously in the daily reports. The state later claimed in court that the records did not exist.\nAugust 2021, Deadliest month in Florida: The state's second-worse month for cases still to date (647,174) and the deadliest month in the entire pandemic with over 10,000 fatalities reported, according to the FDOH. The state continues to issue weekly reports.\nOver 800 Florida physicians send a letter to DeSantis asking for a repeal of the school mask ban and the return of the daily reports in full. DeSantis says the state will look at releasing more county-level data. That data is not produced. In the same week, DeSantis claims, without evidence, that migrants are bringing COVID across the border.\nSeptember 2021, News media join lawsuit: USA TODAY Network and other Florida news organizations join the public records lawsuit.\nMarch 2022, State stops weekly report: The state changed its COVID report again, reducing it to biweekly, again less often than every other state at the time. People looking for statistics were directed to days-old data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nIn the biweekly report, the summary of cases and deaths at the top only listed the increase for the previous seven days even though the reports were two weeks apart, providing a possibly misleading perception of the virus' danger. State reports also included only Florida residents and not visitors for cases and deaths, but did include visitors for vaccination totals.\nMay 2022, Florida finds itself innocent: A state investigation by the FDOH's Office of Chief Inspector General, Michael J. Bennett, who reports to Chief Inspector General Melinda Miguel within Gov. Ron DeSantis' office, finds that Rebekah Jones' claims of data manipulation were unsubstantiated.\nMarch 2023, Totals updated: The CDC added 15,993 COVID cases to its Florida total that had not been previously reported between November and March. No explanation was provided as to why.\nOctober 2023, Florida releases more data, less conveniently: The state of Florida settles the public records lawsuit without admitting guilt and must pay $152,000 in legal costs. The biweekly reports stop in favor of a database including information for all three years of the pandemic.\nHowever, while the new format of the reports now includes the demographic data for all three years the state previously said didn't exist, it is less convenient as there are no cumulative totals, percentages, charts or overviews included, making trends tougher to spot without doing the math, and data on booster doses is no longer provided."

      "text": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Floridians will be keeping their distance and wearing face masks for up to a year until a COVID-19 vaccine exists, Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees said Monday before being whisked away by the governor\u2019s spokeswoman.Rivkees told reporters that Floridians needed to get used to current precautions, such as avoiding crowds of 10 or more and wearing face masks in public.\u201cUntil we get a vaccine, which is a while off, this is going to be our new normal and we need to adapt and protect ourselves,\u201d he said.The surgeon general\u2019s comments appear to conflict with what Gov. Ron DeSantis and his political ally, President Donald Trump, have said about returning to pre-coronavirus life. Practicing social distancing for a year in order to prevent a second wave of outbreaks could take a significant toll on the economy, which has already ground to a halt.Both DeSantis and Trump have worried that closing the economy that long would be a cure worse than the disease, although public health experts have warned that a quick return to normal could be dangerous.It\u2019s not clear whether DeSantis agreed with Rivkees\u2019 assessment. DeSantis\u2019 spokeswoman, Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, did not return a request for comment.Rivkees and two other state officials were made available to speak to reporters following DeSantis\u2019 news conference, the first time in weeks that both Rivkees and Mary Mayhew, secretary for the Agency for Health Care Administration, were seen at a DeSantis news conference.Immediately after Rivkees\u2019 acknowledged that a vaccine could be months or more than a year away, Ferr\u00e9 shifted attention away from Rivkees by asking reporters if they had questions for Mayhew.When a reporter asked Mayhew a question, Ferr\u00e9 went up to Rivkees and the two quickly left the room. Ferr\u00e9 returned. Rivkees did not. His spokesman, Alberto Moscoso, said he left to attend a prescheduled meeting with DeSantis\u2019 Deputy Chief of Staff, Adrian Lukis.Before he left, Rivkees was asked to elaborate on his comments. He said that the current social distancing measures are the only way to stop person-to-person spread of the virus.\u201cAs long as we\u2019re going to have COVID in the environment, and this is a tough virus, we\u2019re going to have to practice these measures so that we are all protected,\u201d Rivkees said.Rivkees, a pediatrician, was a controversial choice by DeSantis to lead Florida\u2019s Department of Health last year. His career has been in pediatrics, academia and research rather than epidemiology or public health.Before DeSantis decided to shut down the state on April 1, Rivkees had not advised the governor either way about whether a shut down was necessary, Ferr\u00e9 told the Times/Herald last month.Rivkees\u2019 spokesman did not say how the surgeon general reached his conclusion on social distancing or whether the governor agreed with it.\u201cSocial distancing and improved hygiene have proven to be effective in impeding the spread of COVID-19,\u201d Moscoso, Rivkees\u2019 spokesman, wrote the Times/Herald an email. \u201cUntil a vaccine is available, precautions will need to be taken to ensure public health.\u201dDeSantis was reluctant to issue a statewide stay-at-home order because he was concerned about its affect on the economy and on people\u2019s mental health, he said. Unemployment claims have soared since mid-March, weeks before he eventually ordered the state\u2019s residents to stay at home on April 1.Governors have many factors to consider, including economic ones, when deciding whether to implement a statewide shut down or making other decisions, according to Harvard professor and epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch.\u201cI don\u2019t think the public health recommendations should always be followed,\u201d said Lipsitch, who was interviewed earlier this month.But he said governors should strongly consider the advice when public health experts are so universal in their belief that a shutdown would prevent the health system from collapsing.\u201cAs a general matter, public health is a type of expertise. Most governors don\u2019t have (that) expertise,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should seek out the people who do have the expertise, otherwise they\u2019re not getting the best advice.\u201d\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 GET THE DAYSTARTER MORNING UPDATE: Sign up to receive the most up-to-date information on COVID-19 and Tampa Bay, six days a week UNEMPLOYMENT Q&A: We answer your questions about Florida unemployment benefits CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCRAPBOOK: Help us tell the story of life under coronavirus MEET THE HELPERS: Highlighting Tampa Bay\u2019s everyday heroes in this crisis FOLLOW OUR COVERAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA: Facebook .

      "text": "Florida leads nation in COVID deaths for third month in a row\nFor the third month in a row, Florida logged more COVID-19 deaths than anywhere else in America.\nThe state\u2019s COVID death toll grew by 1,614 people in August, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. As coronavirus omicron subvariants swept the state this summer, Florida fatalities topped the nation from June through August.\nIt\u2019s also the third summer in a row Florida has been No. 1 for COVID deaths.\nThe state became the national epicenter for the disease in August 2020, after Gov. Ron DeSantis began allowing businesses and public places to reopen. The state again became the COVID fatality capital of America last year in July and August, months after state officials suspended all remaining pandemic restrictions.\nThe disease has killed at least 80,027 Floridians since the start of the pandemic, excluding more than 3,000 victims whom state auditors found by combing through records from 2020 in which physicians classified someone's cause of death as COVID, but the state Health Department did not.\nCOVID is especially deadly to the elderly. Florida\u2019s population is older than most states.\nFlorida added 454 people to its COVID death toll since the state last published its biweekly pandemic report Aug. 26. That\u2019s less than the average weekly increase during the two weeks covered by that report. But it\u2019s higher than the weekly sums logged in April and May.\nEven so, the new federal data also shows that the current COVID wave is continuing to decline statewide.\nCOVID boosters: New COVID boosters coming that target BA.4, BA.5 variants. Here's what you need to know\nBA.5 variant: COVID BA.5 wave still receding across Florida more than a week into school year\nFlorida COVID wave is retreating: COVID-19 wave continues to ebb in Florida\nHospitals across Florida tended to 2,850 COVID-positive patients, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported Friday, down from a summertime peak of more than 4,000 in late July.\nHealth officials logged about 39,000 new COVID cases in the past week, CDC figures released Friday show. That\u2019s the smallest amount since early May. An untold number of infections don\u2019t make it into official statistics because of the rise of at-home tests, whose results aren\u2019t recorded.\nSewage from across the state also is turning up less of the virus, wth results showing fewer coronavirus particles compared to four weeks ago. Readings from Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Orange, Seminole, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties all show declines, according to Boston-based laboratory Biobot Analytics.\nWastewater can reveal COVID trends faster than official case counts. Infected people often shed the most virus at the beginning of their infection.\nMeanwhile, Florida pharmacies were preparing this weekend for new COVID vaccines that target the pathogen\u2019s omicron mutation and its subvariants, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave them final approval Thursday.\nSeveral Publix pharmacies in Palm Beach County said Friday they expect to receive the new doses this weekend. CVS and Walgreens are scheduling and administering shots, the companies said Friday.\nThese shots, tested on mice, are designed to target the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants. As the latest viral wave, driven by BA.5, wanes, the BA.4.6 subvariant comprises a larger share of infections, tests collected by the CDC shows. But the new subvariant is so similar to the ones the new vaccine targets that it could effectively fight new mutations of omicron subvariants.\nVirtually every COVID infection across Florida and the U.S. that have been documented this year were caused by omicron and its mutations.\nThe new virus-fighters come to a state whose vaccination rate has barely budged since June, despite the spread of omicron subvariants. About 81% of Florida residents have gotten at least one shot in their arms, the CDC reported Friday, including about 28% with boosters.\nPeople may have been waiting for the new, omicron-focused vaccines, said Dr. Larry Bush, an infectious disease specialist and former president of the Palm Beach County Medical Society.\n\u201cPerhaps folks were hoping and waiting for this combination vaccine,\u201d Bush said.\nPeople should get the so-called \u201cupdated boosters\u201d \u2014 Moderna\u2019s is approved for adults 18 and older, Pfizer, 12 and up \u2014 at least two months after their most recent dose of the vaccine, the federal government says.\nSmaller pharmacies, which have also placed orders, expect to receive the updated boosters next week. If a shot-seeker lacks insurance, pharmacies will not receive reimbursement from the federal government after administering the vaccine.\nThat\u2019s because federal money to pay for shots dried up in April when Republican senators blocked a $10 billion COVID bill using the legislative procedure known as the filibuster. That requires 60 votes to overcome, but 52 senators, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, voted against ending a filibuster.\nSmaller pharmacies pay out of pocket to vaccinate the uninsured. \u201cWe would never say, \u2018No, we wouldn\u2019t give it to you because you can't pay,\u2019\u201d said pharmacist Jessica Beal, of Hobbes Pharmacy on Merritt Island in Brevard County.\nThe federal government will run out of money by the end of this year to buy more COVID vaccines, the Biden Administration has warned. By 2023, people would start paying out of pocket for costs not covered by insurance.\nCOVID has infected more than 7 million people statewide.\nChris Persaud is The Palm Beach Post's data reporter.

      "text": "Last Friday, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, the surgeon general of Florida and professor of medicine at the University of Florida, announced new guidance from the Florida Department of Health that recommends against vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for men between 18 and 39 years old. As infectious disease epidemiologists, we are concerned that the guidance relies on, and appears to gain legitimacy from, an analysis that does not support it.The Department of Health\u2019s new guidance claims to be based on an analysis that examines the timing of non-COVID-19 deaths relative to vaccination. The aim was to see if deaths were more likely to occur soon after vaccination relative to later in time, a trend which could indicate that the deaths were possibly triggered by vaccination. Based on this study, according to the guidance, \u201cthe benefit of vaccination is likely outweighed by (an) abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men in this age group.\u201dWeighing risks and benefits is a necessary and proper function of our public health authorities. In this case, however, Dr. Ladapo and his department have misstated the risks of vaccination while completely failing to evaluate its benefits. First, the Department of Health\u2019s guidance is directly contradicted by the same data on which is relies. It is true that the analysis found that, compared to other periods of time, vaccinated individuals were more likely to die of heart-related issues in the period immediately following vaccination, particularly men aged 18 to 39 years old. Crucially, however, the study found that the rate of death from all causes other than COVID-19 was no different for individuals immediately following vaccination, in any age group. In other words, the study showed no heightened risk of death due to vaccination. Second, the guidance relies on a study where benefits of vaccination were not even measured . The Department of Health study was designed to focus exclusively on risks of vaccination, by omitting from the analysis anyone who died from COVID-19. This study cannot support the guidance because it explicitly does not consider the benefits of vaccination . Put simply, this supposed \u201crisk-benefit\u201d analysis considers only risks. Third, the Department of Health\u2019s guidance ignored explicit, significant limitations that were listed in the study. The largest concern here is that the study\u2019s key finding, that cardiac mortality risk is elevated immediately following mRNA vaccination in men aged 18 to 39 years old, is based on just 20 deaths. If just two or three of these deaths had some other primary cause \u2014 for example, a cardiac event that was the result of some other illness or even undiagnosed COVID-19 \u2014 the study results would be completely different. The small sample size is a particular issue here because the study neither clearly defined \u201ccardiac-related deaths\u201d nor presented clinical data for persons categorized as having such deaths. Overall, key details typically reported from studies such as this are missing, limiting our ability to evaluate it. Finally, this analysis reaches a conclusion that opposes other, larger studies , that have been conducted across the world. No previous, well-conducted study has found an increase in all-cause or cardiac-related mortality following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in any age group. Taken together with the concerns that we and the study authors have outlined, this divergence should at least give us (and certainly the FDoH) pause.Floridians deserve to have the best information available to make the choices that are right for themselves and their families. We feel compelled to speak out because we fear that this guidance and the surrounding press will unduly serve to undermine public trust in mRNA vaccines, without which hundreds of thousands of people now living would have died of COVID-19. This is not the first proclamation from the surgeon general that uses insufficient or no evidence to undermine COVID-19 vaccines. We hope it will be the last. \u2022 Matt Hitchings is an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. \u2022 Derek Cummings is an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor of biology at the University of Florida. \u2022 Ira Longini is a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida and he carries out research on the transmission and control of infectious disease threats such as COVID-19, ebola, dengue, influenza and cholera. \u2022 Dr. Glenn Morris is a professor of medicine and specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Florida."
