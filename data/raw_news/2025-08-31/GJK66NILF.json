  "description": "A look inside the expansion of Battletech Mercenaries, the alternate univere of Battletech Gothic and a look ahead to the cooperative Battletech Aces.",
  "content": "Like a massive dropship, a few boxes full of goodness have landed at my front door. I\u2019ve been excited to check out new releases for the game ever since I read the book earlier this year. proved to be a bountiful harvest of boxed sets, deluxe accessories and information on future releases.\n\nSpecial thanks to Catalyst Game Labs for providing the material I discuss in this article. Battletech was one of the first games I connected with back in the days when it was created by a company called FASA. It\u2019s been very exciting the past few years to reconnect with one of the best giant stompy robots games out there.\n\nThe overarching storyline for Battletech is the struggle between the noble houses born from the Succession Wars and the returning exiles of the Clans. On one side you have mechwarriors that pass their giant Battlemechs down through the generations like suits of feudal armor. On the other side, you have a warrior culture full of pilots born and bred for mech combat.\n\nfills in the gaps between those two grand traditions. Sometimes the big factions need all the help they can get in taking an objective. That\u2019s where mercenaries come in by offering a third classic character type to this space opera: working class heroes doing their best to keep their equipment running and survive until the next payday.\n\nThis expansion is the result of a massive Kickstarter from a few years ago. It includes more mechs to field and details the heaviest moments of the war between the clan and the houses. Both sides need mercenaries to survive and this box provides a campaign framework for running a mercenary company willing to die for that almighty C-Bill.\n\nThe box also expands the current version of the game by adding non-Battlemech units to engagements. While Battlemechs remain the stars of the show, players who want to add tactics for infantry, cavalry and other modern warfare units can find a great entry point here. I find missions much more interesting with objectives beyond blowing up the other guy and these elements expand those options greatly.\n\nIt also brings a lot of new model options in the Force Packs out in this wave. From objective points to gun towers to a whole squadron of the unlikely fan favorite Urbanmech, Mercenaries makes this space opera bigger and louder. Just make sure the company gets first salvage rights on the battlefield.\n\nAlternate histories are hot right now. It\u2019s fun to see beloved characters take different routes through their stories, make different choices in their history and adopt different haircuts. From Marvel\u2019s What If? to Star Trek\u2019s jaunts to the Mirror Universe, the multiverse is a great way for fans to rearrange the story they know for a little while.\n\ntakes the big scale of the Battletech universe into a darker place. Rather than the great house, this boxed set details the Marauder States in the time of 3015. The Succession Wars took a much darker turn thanks to the development of not just Battlemechs but of horrible flesh and steel monsters called abominations.\n\nYes, Battletech Gothic brings kaiju-style monsters to this version of setting, though as of now they only exist as cardboard hex tokens that can be placed on the battlefield. It\u2019s easy to assume that if this box is popular an expansion with abomination miniatures will be on the way. For now, this box comes with new versions of some classic mechs done up to look like they are off to a Black Sabbath concert.\n\nI think these variations can still see play in the original setting to reflect the tastes or desperate necessities of fringe mercenary groups using whatever\u2019s available to keep their mech on the field. I also think clashing with abominations would make for a fun Halloween themed episode of any campaign. This game has been going for over 40 years and it\u2019s nice to see the current keepers of the flame still willing to experiment a little bit.\n\nOne of the boxed sets I am most excited about is Battletech Aces. This campaign set features options to play solo or cooperatively against enemies that are run by decks of cards. It uses the Alpha Strike set of rules to offer a campaign style game with branching storylines and a way for everyone at the table to be on the same team.\n\nI got a chance to play a demo of the game at Adepticon this past spring. It was satisfying even if I realized too late I made the wrong tactical decisions.I look forward to a deeper dive when the game is released and hope to post it here when I play it some more.\n\nCatalyst announced at Gen Con that the first campaign box will be a Black Friday release. I\u2019m glad to hear that as I was afraid it was going to Kickstarter and be further delayed. I really enjoy cooperative games and think that a Battletech one fills a spot in the market that\u2019s not yet currently covered.\n\nBattletech Mercenaries and Battletech Gothic are available directly from Catalyst or at Friendly Local Game Stores worldwide. Battletech Aces is due out in Q4 of 2025.",

      "text": "Gen Con 2025 took place over the weekend in Indianapolis, Indiana. Tabletop fans gathered to play games, buy games, watch games be played and all sorts of other nerdy activities. While San Diego Comic Con is the most famous geek convention, Gen Con has grown into a vital part of Indiana\u2019s tourist industry.\nBesides all those activities, plenty of big announcements and releases come out of the show. There were too many for one article but I\u2019ve collected the biggest ones with links for more information. Let\u2019s take a look at the news that shook Gen Con this year.\nCritical Role Announces New Campaign And New Game Master At Gen Con 2025\nCritical Role took to the stage on August 2nd at the Fishers Event Center in Indianapolis. They showed off a live version of their hit release Daggerheart but more importantly, they announced the start date of their new campaign: October 2nd.\nWhite the announcement of the fourth campaign was expected, there was a huge twist. Longtime Dungeon Master Matt Mercer is moving over to the player side of the table. In his stead, Dimension 20\u2019s Brennan Lee Mulligan will be taking over the big chair.\nDropout was quick to confirm that Mulligan will not be leaving Dimension 20 nor any of the other shows he\u2019s been doing for them. More details, like who will be joining Mercer as a player, will be announced in the lead-up to the new campaign. One of the big questions being debated by fans is whether this campaign will continue using Dungeons and Dragons as its system or if the show will want to highlight Daggerheart with a table full of actual play heavy hitters.\nFor those not in tune with the actual play scene, this amounts to a blockbuster trade in sports. On the pop culture side, this would be like James Gunn being announced as the director of the next Avengers while continuing his work at DC Studios. It\u2019s an exciting time for fans of Critical Role and Dimension 20.\nStarfinder Second Edition Drops At Gen Con 2025\nPaizo released the newest edition of its space fantasy role playing game after a year\u2019s worth of playtesting. Starfinder Second Edition is now fully compatible with Pathfinder Second Edition. I can\u2019t wait for my players to get into space combat with a dragon.\nStarfinder embraces space opera in the style of media such as Star Wars or Guardians of the Galaxy. As part of the Pathfinder universe it blends magic and technology into all kinds of strange adventures. The storyline for the new edition has included some wild twists such as a giant eldritch horror hatching out of a planet like an egg.\nSpeaking of adventures, the convention also saw Murder In Metal City arrive at the show. This boxed set doesn\u2019t just contain a mystery adventure but also the tokens, maps and handouts needed to drive the story forward. It\u2019s a great way to put the ned edition through its paces.\nGen Con 2025 Role Playing Game Announcements\nMagpie Games announced Temeraire The Role Playing Game on Thursday. They\u2019ve partnered with author Naomi Novik to bring her novels about an alternate history where dragons fight in the Napoleonic Wars to the tabletop. The game is expected to go to crowdfunding in 2026 and a full release in 2027.\nAn adaptation of the Diablo video games is coming from Glass Cannon Unplugged. The game is being put together by RPG design heavyweights such as Joe LeFavi (Blade Runner), Przemys\u0142aw Zub (Dying Light), Cam Banks (Marvel Heroic Roleplaying), John Harper (Blades in the Dark), Mike Olson (Fate), and Shawn Tomkin (Ironsworn). The Kickstarter hoping to launch this game looks to kick off later this year.\nRenegade Game Studios announced earlier in the week that an RPG based on Matt Dinniman\u2019s Dungeon Crawler Carl books is under development. The setting features humans fighting their way through alien dungeons for the amusement of an intergalactic game show. The first game is expected next year but it is unknown if it will up Essence20, like the recently released Welcome To Night Vale RPG, or an original system.\nThe Cypher System, from Monte Cook Games is evolving with a focus on faster character generation and better corebook organization. A crowdfunding campaign will start soon with a projected delivery of the new books in 2026. Fans looking for more information on what\u2019s changing can find it here.\nGen Con 2025 went by in a blur. It\u2019s The Best Four Days In Gaming but its influence expands far beyond the convention. I look forward to covering these games as additional information comes to light."

      "text": "Space operas like Star Wars and Dune project epic tales across the stars. On the tabletop side, games like Battletech and Warhammer 40,000 take up their own massive stories. The makers of Battletech recently announced an upcoming project that\u2019s something of a cover album of the grim dark future where there is only war.\nBattletech: Gothic was publicly announced last week at Adepticon in Milwaukee, WI. The boxed set features new sculpts and battle maps. More importantly, it offers a darker take on historical events in the Battletech timeline.\nIn this version, humanity\u2019s lust for war has turned grim. Not only do grand factions war for dwindling resources on devastated planets but they must also contend against abominations. These twisted fusions of flesh and steel challenge mechwarriors for mastery of the battlefield.\n\u201cAs a long-time fan of science fiction settings, one of my favorite riffs has long been the \u201cwhat if?\u201d possibilities they offer,\u201d said Herbert A. Beas II, author of the Battletech: Gothic setting. \"Now, while just about every sci-fi technically asks and answers that very question, what I\u2019m talking about here is the kind of \u201cwhat if?\u201d that spawns from a fictional universe that\u2019s already steeped in its own deep lore. Be it Star Trek\u2019s \u201cMirror Universe,\u201d the \u201cNightmares of Futures Past\u201d take on the superhero universe of Marvel Comics, DC\u2019s \u201cInjustice\u201d universe, or the \u201cShattered Glass\u201d variation on Transformers\u2014so many engaging, altered takes on the characters and stories we enjoyed one way have proven that we can always look at them in a new and different way that are just as compelling, while still enriching our love of their original timelines. As a writer and player of many a Battletech storyline, I have long asked the \u201cwhat if?\u201d question about established lore, but it wasn\u2019t until I produced 2014\u2019s Halloween-themed adventure supplement Empires Aflame that I seriously entertained a deep dive into the realm of alternative Battletech histories. I had an absolute blast on that project, and kind of wanted to do more ever since! [When]\nThe box is the first entry in the Continuum series which will explore different versions of the setting with lternate histories and aesthetics. Each boxed set is a one and done affair though the components will remain compatible with mainline products for players who want to take advantage of the unique looks of the redesigned mechs. Battletech: Gothic will contain record sheets for A Game of Armored Combat and cards for Alpha Strike.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on Battletech for thirty years now,\" said Randall N. Bills, Creative Director for Catalyst Game Labs. \"From game creation and development to art direction, writing novels to lore coordination with computer games, to everything in between. Yet Battletech: Gothic was a moment to step into a new space, creating the first official alternate setting for this game I\u2019ve loved and played now for forty years. Working closely with Marco Mazzoni to hone his stunning art; coordinating with Herb Beas for the creation of this dark universe; meshing with Ray Arrastia to ensure we kept it all within some boundaries; to working alongside our manufacturer, Liya, to take the plastic models to new heights of quality and customization for Battletech fans of every stripe: this was such a creatively challenging and rewarding experience! Can\u2019t wait to see these designs on gaming tables everywhere. While we\u2019re already starting development of our next Continuum game setting in Rockets & Rayguns, an homage to the golden age of science fiction.\u201d\nBattletech: Gothic is currently expected for a summer 2025 release."

      "text": "The Battletech universe is one where humanity has made it to the stars. It\u2019s also a setting where war continues to reign using majestic giant robots called battlemechs to fight across multiple worlds. Mechwarriors remain the stars of the show as they pilot these machines to victory.\nSince the game\u2019s creation by FASA Corporation in 1984 the story of Battletech has played out over thousands of game tables. It\u2019s also been told in novels, video games and even a saturday morning cartoon. In the 41 years of real time, the timeline within the Battletech universe has passed through centuries of alliances, devastation and more.\nThat can be an intimidating amount of information to digest for players. Devoted fans have turned sarna.net into an indispensable resource for Battletech details without having to hunt down specific books or game expansions. Many of the foundational documents that built the story are out of print but are retained here for anyone who knows what they\u2019re looking for.\nCatalyst Game Labs, the current tabletop publisher for Battletech recently published a book that gives a broad overview of this future history. Battletech Universe looks at the most important points of the timeline for fans new and old to remind everyone what makes this game so unique. The company provided a copy of the book for review in this article.\nBattletech History\nThe first half of Battletech Universe details the history of the giant mech space opera. It begins by detailing the origins of the battlemech and the organization that helped humanity spread throughout the galaxy. The Star League was our first great intergalactic empire but it would not last for long.\nEach chapter of the book details one of the eras in the game\u2019s history. Classic Battletech, for example, takes place during the Successor Wars where great houses battled to see who would take up the mantle of the fallen Star League. This was the era where I first started playing the game and remains my favorite.\nOther eras include the Clan invasion where a branch of humanity that left during the fall of the Star League returns to make war with the great houses. The Dark Age saw the technology of battlemechs fall into disrepair and forced mechwarriors to make due with industrial mechs and other machines not originally built to do battle. The game currently stands on the cusp of the age of the ilClan, where the Clans race toward conquering our home planet of Terra to be considered the Clan above all other Clans.\nEach of these eras is detailed with full color art and important moments at the time. Battles, weddings, alliances and betrayals are brought to the forefront from the novels and other media that helped the setting evolve. I enjoyed the refresher of the eras that I already knew as well as learning about the eras that I didn\u2019t know.\nBattletech Factions\nRegardless of the era of Battletech, what makes the game stand out are the factions involved. They run the gamut from huge galactic royal houses to small mercenary companies. No matter the size, these groups have had a huge impact on fictional history.\nEach of the main factions gets a few pages on history, culture and goals. That covers the great houses and the larger clans. These sections also include their state of play as the game enters its new era.\nSmaller factions get smaller write ups but they are no less impactful. The book includes details on the notable personalities within these smaller groups and their logos and preferred tools of battle. These characters stand out in the minds of Battletech fans and it\u2019s very exciting to see them depicted in artwork.\nThe factions section is devoted to where the game\u2019s setting is today. Fans who want a glimpse of the future will enjoy this section the most. That\u2019s one of the most exciting things about Battletech: while it is known for having a rich history it\u2019s never been afraid to make more.\nBattletech Universe is a great entry point to the game. Whether a fan of the original board game, the many spin-offs or the video game series, the book gives a concise, engaging history of the universe full of great details for old and new fans alike. Battletech may be entering middle age, but it\u2019s never looked better."

      "text": "Nearly 40 years ago, FASA Corporation launched Battletech, a military sci-fi franchise that began as a miniatures board game and has become so much more to its fans. Through fiction, video games and more the world has expanded and grown while still keeping what hooked so many people at its center. Battletech puts players in control of giant, heavily armed robots and lets them fight.\nCurrently, there is a blockbuster Kickstarter going on that\u2019s looking that has lots of what fans love, such as new Battlemech miniatures and stories from the world. It\u2019s also offering a glimpse ahead into new media such as comic books. Why are fans flocking to pick up a copy of Battletech: Mercenaries?\nWhat Is Battletech?\nBattletech tells the tale of humanity\u2019s future in space. The expansion to the stars is wracked with outbreaks of war. The famous war machine in these battles is the battlemech, a massive war robot piloted by elite fighters called mechwarriors.\nMechwarriors come from all walks of life. Some are nobles whose battlemechs are handed down from generation to generation. Some are genetically modified warriors who live for combat. Some are dingy mercenaries who keep their robot running by taking whatever jobs are available.\nThanks to the popularity of the 2018 Battletech video game, many fans are experiencing the setting from the beginning during the Succession Wars. Catalyst Game Labs has produced two tactical battle games set during these times of war with expansions that unravel into the other era of the game. Recent products, including the currently running Kickstarter, support both versions of the game.\nBattletech: A Game of Armored Combat\nThe Battletech: A Game of Armored Combat boxed set feels and plays most like the original game. Players must manage heat to take action against opponents while tracking damage to various locations on their battlemechs. Play is centered around 1-4 mechs on a side with more mech taking longer to resolve.\nWhen this game came out in 2019, Catalyst Game Labs decided to revamp how it was delivering the experience. The size of the minatures was slightly increased to allow for more dynamic poses on the battlefield. Pilot cards also allowed tabletop generals to further modify mech performance or to allow the table to play out clashes from the novels and other tie-in media.\nBattletech: Alpha Strike\nFor fans who want a larger scale feel, Battletech: Alpha Strike slims down the ruleset for a faster game that still keeps classic elements like heat management and critical hits. These rules are for players who already have a lot of battlemech minatures that they want to use more of on an epic battlefield. The boxed set grows the collection immensely by featuring 13 miniatures.\nThe current run of miniatures are already assembled and easy to paint. Force packs let players use miniatures for either game as they come with information for both A Game of Armored Combat and Alpha Strike. There\u2019s also a robust community online that encourages players to trade and buy individual miniatures from each other.\nBattletech Mercenaries Boxed Set\nThe current Kickstarter for Battletech: Mercenaries adds two iconic elements into the current version of the game. The first is a deeper dive into the world of the mercenary. While other forces fight for honor or pride, mercenary mechwarriors fight for the all too human motivation of keeping the lights on.\nThe other addition to the game includes combined forces such as tanks, air support and infantry. Reimagined miniatures of these sorts of figures are included in the main boxed set. They are also available in the next round of force pack expansions to bring in a new strategic front for the mechwarriors to master.\nBacking the Kickstarter gives fans a chance to get these materials as soon as they are released but also access to cheaper minis and a massive amount of digital fiction set in the world. The Kickstarter finishes on April 20th. The game expansion is expected to ship in June of 2024."
