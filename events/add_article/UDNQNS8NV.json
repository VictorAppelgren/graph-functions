      "summary": "Shell has decided not to restart construction of its Rotterdam biofuels facility after a commercial and technical review found the project no longer competitive amid a prolonged slump in the biofuels market. The company took a $780 million impairment when it paused work in July 2024, citing insufficient competitiveness to meet customers’ demand for affordable, low‑carbon fuels. The decision follows similar moves by rivals such as BP, heightened competition from Chinese imports, and regulatory changes in Sweden and Finland that have increased the supply of renewable fuels.",
