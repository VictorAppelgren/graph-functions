  "description": "U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.",
  "content": "U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.\n\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.\n\nThe new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. Tuesday\u2019s figures probably reflect some impact from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.\n\nBrian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, said that overall U.S. tariffs \u2014 calculated as the amount of duties paid by U.S. companies divided by overall imports \u2014 has reached 10%, the highest in decades, and will likely keep rising for months.\n\n\u201cThose cost increases will be passed on to the consumer in some way, shape, or form,\u201d Bethune said. Some companies could return to \u201cshrinkflation,\u201d he added, in which they reduce the package size of a good while keeping the price the same.\n\nAnd companies that are absorbing tariff costs, which would cut into their profit margins, are less likely to hire new employees, he said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may now be in a difficult spot.\n\nHiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank at its next meeting in September, and some Fed officials have raised concerns about the health of the job market. A rate cut by the Fed often, but not always, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.\n\nEconomists are divided over how Fed officials will read the data in the coming months. Some argued that the worsening jobs picture will outweigh lingering inflation concerns and lead the Fed to cut at its next meeting in September. Yet some say that with core inflation notably above 2% and rising, the Fed will postpone that decision.\n\nChair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines \u2014 a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump attacked Powell again for not cutting rates and suggested he would allow a lawsuit against the Fed to proceed because of the rising costs of its extensive building renovation. It wasn\u2019t clear what lawsuit he was referring to.\n\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.\n\nGas prices fell 2.2% from June to July and have plunged 9.5% from a year earlier, the government\u2019s report said. Grocery prices slipped 0.1% last month, though they are still 2.2% higher than a year ago.\n\nTariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. The cost of furniture leapt 0.9% in July and is 3.2% higher than a year earlier.\n\nCoffee costs nearly 15% more than a year earlier, mostly because of troubled harvests overseas, though steep duties on imports from Brazil could push those prices higher in the coming months. Nearly all U.S. coffee is imported.\n\nTuesday\u2019s data arrives at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported.\n\nThe president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer.\n\nAdding to the turmoil at BLS is a government hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did earlier this year. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.\n\nSmaller companies are trying to avoid raising prices and some have turned to novel ways of raising funds.\n\nClothing maker Princess Awesome, which designs matching clothes for children and adults, has seen its costs jump 15% to 20% because of the tariffs. The company has joined a lawsuit seeking to block the duties. Rebecca Melsky, CEO and co-founder of the firm, says it is prohibitively expensive to make the cotton blend fabrics it uses in the United States.\n\nFor now, the company has instituted a \u201ctip jar\u201d on its website where it asks customers to help defray the cost of goods.\n\n\u201cWe have not across the board raised prices because of the tariffs -- yet,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven\u2019t fallen much since the levies were put in place.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Yet the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear two-thirds of the burden, while foreign exporters pay a quarter and U.S. companies handle less than a tenth.\n\nMany large corporations are raising prices, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Most of those increases weren\u2019t in place for Tuesday\u2019s inflation report.\n\nConsumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices in August on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Walmart has also raised prices.\n\nAnd cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.\n\nRugaber writes for the Associated Press.

      "text": "Trump\u2019s broad tariffs go into effect, just as economic pain is surfacing\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump began imposing higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariff threats has begun to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.\nJust after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.\n\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. He said the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but did not provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding the rates.\nDespite the uncertainty, the White House is confident that the onset of his tariffs will provide clarity about the path for the world\u2019s largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance America as a manufacturing power.\nSo far, however, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to the U.S. as companies and consumers brace for the impact of the new taxes.\nRisk of economic erosion\nHiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after the initial tariff rollout in April, said John Silvia, chief executive of Dynamic Economic Strategy.\n\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers\u2019 real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the government said second-quarter GDP growth was 3% annualized. On Friday, the government said job growth had cratered, pointing to recession.\nMany economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University.\nTrump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce America\u2019s persistent trade deficit. But importers tried to avoid the taxes by bringing in more goods before the tariffs took effect. As a result, the $582.7-billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.\nThe economic pain is not confined to the U.S.\nGermany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump\u2019s earlier rounds of tariffs took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.\nDismay in India and Switzerland\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have been rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and renegotiated.\nTrump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India because of its purchases of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.\nA leading group of Indian exporters said that will affect nearly 55% of the country\u2019s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose long-standing clients.\nTrump has signed an executive order to place an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil.\n\u201cAbsorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable. Margins are already thin,\u201d S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, said in a statement.\nThe Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to meet Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert a 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss goods.\nImport taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs, and Trump announced 100% tariffs on computer chips. That could leave the U.S. economy in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impact.\nStock market remains solid\nThe president\u2019s use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is under a legal challenge. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical, such as Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who was House speaker.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\u201d Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday.\nTrump is aware of the risk that courts could overturn his tariffs, prompting him to say on his Truth Social platform: \u201cTHE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA\u2019S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\u201d\nThe stock market has been solid during the tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market\u2019s rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump\u2019s tax and spending measure signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.\nOn the global financial markets, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia, while stocks were slipping on Wall Street.\nBut ING\u2019s Brzeski warned: \u201cWhile financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let\u2019s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.\u201d\nTrump foresees an economic boom. American voters and the rest of the world wait, nervously.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he\u2019s creating, and that\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \u201cThe rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\u201d\nBoak writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "What U.S. consumers can expect from new tariffs on imported goods\n- Share via\nAmerican businesses and consumers soon will have a better idea of how President Trump\u2019s foreign trade agenda might affect them now that the United States has imposed higher tariffs on products from dozens of countries.\nIt\u2019s been nearly 100 years since the nation had an overall import tax rate as high as the one set Thursday. But the individual effect on business costs and consumer prices could vary as much as the tariffs applied to goods of nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, from complicated economies like the European Union to the small African nation of Lesotho.\nExports from a majority of them are getting taxed at 15%. For a handful of countries in Asia, the rate is 19%. Products from the rest are subject to taxes of 20% to 50%. Meanwhile, a 55% tariff on Chinese-made goods is scheduled to take effect next week if a U.S.-China trade deal is not agreed on before then.\nBusinesses that rely on goods imported from India are preparing for a 25% tariff to take effect as President Trump\u2019s trade war with once-strong trade partners continues.\nBusinesses in the U.S. and abroad have been dealing in various ways since February with Trump\u2019s fluctuating tariffs on specific products and countries. Many automakers appeared to have absorbed the costs for now. But recent government data indicated that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June.\nBecause tariffs are a tax on imports, economists have expected U.S. consumers to foot at least part of the bill eventually.\nThe country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president\u2019s earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. That\u2019s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the nonpartisan policy research center.\nThe projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August.\n\u201cRetailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new increased tariffs will significantly raise costs for U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,\u201d Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to the Associated Press.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the tariffs and where U.S. consumers are most likely to notice effects:\nHow we got here\nTrump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.\nThe president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday.\nIn the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump\u2019s first term shields most of those countries\u2019 products from punishing duties.\nThe president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India\u2019s tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration.\nOther duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren\u2019t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs.\nTariffs are already impacting prices\nThe U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased.\nShoppers should be prepared to pay more for clothes and shoes because the combined tariffs \u201cdisproportionately affect clothing and textiles,\u201d according to the Budget Lab at Yale. It estimates that shoe prices will go up 39% temporarily and stay 19% above where they are now. For apparel, the Budget Lab put the comparable figures at 37% and 18%.\nOverall, Americans face an average tax of 18.6% for imported products, the highest rate since 1933, the research center said.\nFood and drink prices will climb\nThe tariffs will almost certainly result in higher food prices, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. The U.S. simply doesn\u2019t make enough of some products, like bananas or coffee, to satisfy demand. Fish, beer and liquor are also likely to get more expensive, the foundation said.\nThe U.S. Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales.\n\u201cMr. President, we need toasts, not tariffs, as we head into the most important season for our industry,\u201d read the letter dated Wednesday.\nWine distributors and retailers avoided price increases before now by accelerating shipments from France and other EU countries earlier in the year. But with the EU\u2019s tariff rate raised to 15% on Thursday, customers may see European wines costing 30% more in September, U.S. Wine Trade Alliance President Ben Aneff said.\nCar prices hold steady \u2014 so far\nSome automakers already raised prices to counteract tariffs. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump\u2019s trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S.\nFor the most part, automakers waited for details instead of passing on tariff costs to consumers. But that could change.\nGeneral Motors said July 22 that the effect of the tariffs could get more pronounced in the third quarter of the year. GM has estimated the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year.\nToyota reported Thursday a 37% drop in profits in the April-June quarter, cutting its full-year earnings forecasts largely because of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nStill a clouded picture\nEven with so many new tariffs kicking in, the tariff situation remains fluid. Trump\u2019s use of an emergency powers law to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. The case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nMoreover, the tariffs on goods from China haven\u2019t been finalized. Consumers may start seeing more effects when the administration ends a tax exemption for small parcels sent from other countries.\nTrump last week signed an order to suspend the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption that has allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. International e-commerce companies have widely used the rule to avoid paying customs charges.\nTrump withdrew the exemption in early April for goods shipped from China and Hong Kong tariff-free. It is now set to be eliminated for low-value packages from every country Aug. 29.\nD\u2019Innocenzio and Durbin write for the Associated Press.

      "text": "What to know about Trump\u2019s newest and most sweeping tariffs\n- Share via\nBANGKOK \u2014 President Trump on Thursday imposed once unthinkably high U.S. taxes on imports from dozens of countries, part of his campaign to turn one of the world\u2019s most open economies into a fortress bristling with barriers to trade.\nThe taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 that took effect at midnight apply to products from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands.\nTrump believes the tariffs will protect U.S. industry from foreign competition, encourage companies to build factories and hire workers in the United States and raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\n\u201cGrowth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nBut mainstream economists and policy analysts warn that tariffs are paid by importers in the United States who will try to pass along the cost through higher prices to their customers, businesses and consumers alike; make the economy less efficient and innovative by shielding domestic companies from foreign competition; and threaten U.S. relationships with longstanding allies and trading partners.\nIndeed, the economic damage is already starting show.\nHere\u2019s what to know:\nMany tariffs could have been higher\nThe levies that took effect Thursday are a revised version of what Trump called \u201d reciprocal tariffs \u201d announced on April 2. Those earlier threats included import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else. The move triggered sell-offs in financial markets, and Trump backtracked to give countries a chance to negotiate.\nSome of them did, caving in to Trump\u2019s demands to accept high tariffs to ward off even higher ones. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are well above the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan in April.\nThailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of about 20%.\nIndonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president\u2019s office. \u201cWe were competing against Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and China ... and they are all subject to higher reciprocal tariffs,\u201d Hastiadi said. \u201cWe believe we will stay competitive.\u201d\nTrump dictated terms to countries\nFor countries that didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t reach a deal, Trump dictated terms himself, plastering tariffs ranging from 10% on the Falkland Islands to 41% on Syria. Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Tiny Lesotho in southern Africa, for instance, ended up with a 15% tariff instead of the 50% Trump originally announced.\nIndia also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict.\nImpoverished Laos and war-torn Myanmar face 40% rates. Trump whacked Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he\u2019s unhappy with its treatment of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. South Africa said the steep 30% rate Trump has ordered on the exporter of precious gems and metals has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left the country scrambling to find new markets outside the United States.\nEven wealthy Switzerland is under the gun. Swiss officials were visiting Washington this week to try to stave off a whopping 39% tariff on U.S. imports of its chocolate, watches and other products.\nOverall, the average U.S. tariff rate has risen from around 2.5% before Trump returned to the White House to 18.6% \u2014 the highest since 1933 \u2014 the Budget Lab at Yale University reported Thursday.\nCanada, Mexico have own arrangements\nGoods that comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term are excluded from the tariffs.\nSo, even though U.S. neighbor and ally Canada was hit by a 35% tariff after it defied Trump \u2014 a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 by saying it would recognize a Palestinian state, most of its exports to the U.S. remain duty free.\nCanada\u2019s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the agreement since regional rules mean Canadian and Mexico companies can claim preferential treatment.\nThe slice of Mexican exports not covered by the USMCA is subject to a 25% tariff, down from an earlier rate of 30%, during a 90-day negotiating period that began last week.\nMeanwhile, Trump has yet to announce whether he will extend an Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China that would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl.\nHigher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on \u201cflexible work\u201d \u2014 the gig economy \u2014 for their livelihoods, the government estimates.\nStill, China has shown that it has leverage to resist Trump\u2019s threats: It can withhold exports of rare earth minerals that companies need for everything from wind turbines to electric vehicle batteries.\nConsiderable uncertainty remains\nDetails of the deals reached in a frenzy of negotiations leading up to Trump\u2019s August deadline have not been published \u2014 and are already subject to disagreement.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, for instance, told reporters that Japan is asking the U.S. government to immediately correct tariffs that are not consistent with their agreement.\n\u201cThe uncertainty about whether Trump was bluffing with his tariff threats and simply using those threats as a negotiating tool has been resolved,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy and economics at Cornell University. \u201cBut the uncertainty about the tariffs themselves, including the rates and what countries and products will be covered, is still unresolved in any durable way and remains subject to Trump\u2019s whims.\n\u201cEven the deals that have ostensibly been negotiated lack clarity about their details and are far from settled.\u201d\nTrump also is threatening new tariffs \u2014 including levies of 200% or more on pharmaceuticals and 100% on computer chips.\nTrump\u2019s trade agenda also is under attack in court, adding to the uncertainty.\nA specialized trade court in New York ruled in May that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing April 2 tariffs and earlier ones on Canada, China and Mexico. An appeals court, which allowed the government to continue collecting tariffs while the case moves through the judicial system, now has the case, which is expected to eventually go to the Supreme Court.\nIn a hearing last week, the judges sounded skeptical about the Trump administration\u2019s authority to declare a national emergency to justify the tariffs.\nKurtenbach and Wiseman write for the Associated Press.

  "argos_summary": "U.S. consumer prices rose 2.7% in July, unchanged from June, while core inflation climbed to 3.1%, keeping inflation above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target and raising questions about future rate cuts as job growth slows.  The rise in prices is partly driven by President Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which have increased import duties to record levels, forcing many companies to absorb costs or pass them on through shrinkflation and higher retail prices.  The Fed faces a dilemma between curbing inflation and supporting a fragile labor market, while Trump has publicly criticized the central bank and threatened legal action over its policy.  The linked reports detail how the new tariffs are reshaping U.S. trade, raising costs for consumers and businesses, and creating uncertainty for global partners and domestic manufacturers.",
