  "content": "A publicly funded grocery store in Missouri abruptly closed Tuesday morning \u2014 leaving a note on the entrance stating it can no longer serve residents due to circumstances \u201cbeyond our control.\u201d\n\nSun Fresh Market in Kansas City \u2014 which opened in 2018 as part of a multi-million-dollar revitalization plan \u2014 mysteriously shuttered just weeks after viral footage exposed the struggling store\u2019s bare shelves, foul odor and frustrated clientele.\n\nThe alarming footage, taken by local outlet KSHB 41, sparked renewed skepticism of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani\u2019s signature proposal to bring city-owned markets to the Big Apple if he\u2019s elected mayor.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control, we are no longer, at this time, able to serve the residents of this community,\u201d a sign posted outside the store read, KSHB reported.\n\n\u201cIt has always been our dream and passion to provide quality products and services in a safe, family environment. At this time, unfortunately, we are unable to do that.\u201d\n\nThe store \u2014 located in a city-owned building \u2014 was opened as part of a $15 million revitalization project aimed at rejuvenating the community.\n\nHowever, the area quickly became plagued by crime and safety issues, according to the report.\n\nDespite receiving millions in taxpayer funding since opening and thousands more for security upgrades, the store still struggled to stock the shelves with produce and other essential goods.\n\nThe store\u2019s nonprofit owner told the outlet in a statement that its Midtown location can longer serve residents as of Tuesday, without providing an explanation.\n\nThe sudden shutdown comes a few months after Mamdani secured the New York City Democratic mayoral nomination with a campaign centered on affordability, including a plan to establish a $65 million network of government-owned grocery stores, with one located in each of the five boroughs.\n\nThe Queens assemblyman has repeatedly claimed that city funds would be redirected from corporate supermarkets to city-owned groceries that would lower prices.\n\nHowever, Mamdani\u2019s plan remains vague on key details, including whether the city itself will operate the stores or delegate management to private or nonprofit partners, as he uses the term \u201ccity-owned\u201d and \u201ccity-run\u201d interchangeably to describe his ambitious campaign proposal.\n\nExperts and critics predict Mamdani\u2019s far-fetched plan will ultimately fail over supply chain issues, but he has continued to pursue it as a potential practical experiment.\n\n\u201cNo matter how you think about the idea, I do think there should be room for reasonable policy experimentation in our cities and in our country, where we actually test out our idea,\u201d he said on \u201cThe Bulwark\u201d podcast last month.\n\n\u201cAnd if they work, they work. And if they don\u2019t, c\u2019est la vie, then the idea was wrong.",

      "text": "For a preview of NYPD-City Hall relations under a Mayor Mamdani, consider one ex-cop\u2019s take on the tenure of Zohran\u2019s favorite former mayor, Bill de Blasio.\nIn her memoir, \u201cAnd Then Came the Blues,\u201d retired NYPD Det. Katrina Brownlee spills on her experiences on Blas\u2019 security detail.\nSpoiler: It was bad.\nOnce, she writes, while \u201con one of his typical power trips,\u201d Blas called a sergeant to complain after a uniformed cop on his team briefly took off his hat.\nOverall, the ex-cop \u201csensed that the mayor generally did not like police officers.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a diplomatic way to convey his open disdain for cops, so deeply rooted that late in 2014, de Blasio claimed he was teaching his black son Dante to fear his dad\u2019s own security detail.\nYes, he wisely hired Bill Bratton as his first police commissioner, but Blas still never missed an opportunity to bash cops to score points with the left.\nBrownlee recalls that de Blasio could be \u201cgenuinely caring\u201d in private, but his public attitude was so toxic that New York\u2019s Finest turned their backs on him repeatedly at the funerals of slain-on-duty officers.\nIf Mamdani, whose record and rhetoric is markedly more anti-cop, wins this fall, relations seem sure to get more dysfunctional.\nHe not only jumped on the \u201cdefund the police\u201d bandwagon in 2020, he called cops a face of \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and the NYPD so \u201cwicked & corrupt\u201d that it needs to be dismantled, not just reformed.\nDe Blasio, that is, pioneered mayoral cop-bashing; Mamdani\u2019s generation of lefties is far more rabid.\nThat he\u2019s muted his hate for now simply means he figures he\u2019s got the anti-cop vote in the bag; saying more before Election Day can only cost him support.\nBut he\u2019d still be de Blasio\u2019s heir in the worst possible way.\nMayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch are making steady gains against the crime crisis unleashed by New York\u2019s anti-cop pols.\nElecting a mayor whose relations with New York\u2019s Finest are already poisonous is a surefire bet to restart the downward spiral.\nAnd the men and women who keep New Yorkers safe deserve better than a mayor who\u2019ll never have their backs."

      "text": "KSHB 41 reporter Alyssa Jackson covers portions of Johnson County, including Overland Park, Prairie Village and Leawood. Share your story idea with Alyssa.\n-\nSun Fresh Market grocery store has been open since 2018 on the corner of Linwood Boulevard and Prospect Avenue.\nThe store was part of a revitalization project on Kansas City, Missouri's east side that put a spark back in the community.\nNeighbors told KSHB 41 their expectations at the project's ground breaking in 2017.\n\"We need this so badly,\" said Mary White, who lived in the neighborhood at the time. \"It's the end of an era and a new beginning.\"\nHowever, after millions of dollars invested in the shopping center, Sun Fresh Market is failing.\nThe store is drawing national attention because of its struggles.\nA rancid odor fills the market, with shoppers turned off by bare shelves and coolers, along with empty meat and deli departments.\nJannine Owens told KSHB 41's Alyssa Jackson on Monday she's been shopping at the store since it opened, but in recent weeks, she can't leave with everything she needs.\n\"We need answers because at the end of the day, that don't make sense,\" Owens said.\nThe City of Kansas City owns the shopping center.\nThe Sun Fresh Market is part of a Community Improvement District (CID).\nThe city collects revenue from a 1% retail sales tax on purchases in the CID to help pay for the development.\nThe Linwood Shopping Center was a $15 million public/private investment.\nOver the years, the city has spent tens of thousands of dollars on security because of persistent crime problems.\nLast year, the city council approved $750,000 for security, lighting, and infrastructure supported by federal funding through the Community Block Development Grant (CBDG).\nWith all the investment outside of the market, shoppers want to see results inside.\nPat Clarke, a community advocate who shops at the store, said that's a difficult choice to make.\nHe said: \"That\u2019s a hell of a call because all of them run neck and neck. No security \u2014 got a problem. No product \u2014 you got a problem. Here, maybe soon \u2014 no store, we really got a problem then.\"\nThrough its subsidiary, Midtown Grocers, LLC, the Sun Fresh Market is owned and operated by the nonprofit, Community Builders of Kansas City (CBKC).\nCBKC, which states on its website that it has secured $225 million of investment in urban renewal since 1991, took ownership of the grocery store in 2022. The group also owns and operates the Sun Fresh on Blue Parkway, a few miles from the Linwood Boulevard and Prospect Avenue store.\nEmmet Pierson Jr., president and CEO of CBKC, declined an interview but shared a statement:\n\"Community Builders of Kansas City, through Midtown Grocers LLC, has worked tirelessly to provide food and necessary services to the urban community. Community Builders is committed to addressing the food desert that exists within our under-resourced communities. However, for years, Community Builders has been vocal, in the press, with the community, and with the City of Kansas City, Missouri (the landlord of the KC Sun Fresh Midtown location), of the challenges we face. Community Builders\u2019 concerns and fears are well documented. We have no other comments at this time.\"\nThird District City Council members and Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas were unavailable for interviews about the grocery store.\nCity Manager Mario Vasquez's office sent KSHB 41 a statement about current efforts at the Sun Fresh:\nCity staff are actively working with the property manager and other partners to address concerns about the store\u2019s condition, including the reported odors and maintenance needs. \"A smoke test was recently conducted to investigate potential issues with the plumbing. While no pipe cracks were found, additional follow-up is underway to address lingering smells believed to be connected to drain maintenance and the waste compactor area.\nSteps are being taken to resolve these issues, including scheduled clean out and deodorizing by Waste Management.\nSeparately, the City is working through the federal approval process to amend the 2024 Action Plan to allocate Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for security, repairs, and improvements tied to the Linwood CID. This includes, HVAC and refrigeration upgrades, which are subject to both HUD and City Council approval timelines.\nWe recognize the importance of this grocery store for surrounding neighborhoods, and City staff are committed to supporting a safe and healthy shopping environment.\"\n\u2014"

But he is writing checks that the people of NYC will have to pay."

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani can\u2019t stop talking about Andrew Cuomo\u2019s rent-stabilized dig during anti-Trump NYC tour\nSo much for Zohran Mamdani\u2019s ballyhooed anti-President Trump tour.\nThe Democratic socialist on Tuesday again spent a stop on his weeklong \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour instead bashing his mayoral election rival Andrew Cuomo \u2014 calling the pugilistic ex-gov \u201cpetty\u201d amid their escalating spat over Mamdani\u2019s $2,300 rent-stabilized apartment.\nEven when Mamdani spoke about Trump, he attempted to tie the president to Cuomo, arguing the two hotheaded Queens natives share many similarities.\n\u201cWe must remember that Andrew Cuomo has spent more time talking about my apartment than asking why so many New Yorkers are being forced out of theirs,\u201d Mamdani said at his \u201cBrooklyn Against Trump\u201d event.\n\u201cHe has spent more time criticizing me than he has criticizing the legislation that Donald Trump has passed.\u201d\nCuomo, in the latest salvo in what he has ambitiously dubbed \u201c#Rentgate,\u201d demanded on X Tuesday that Mamdani cough up his lease to prove he didn\u2019t have his highbrow parents \u2014 a famed filmmaker and an accomplished academic \u2014 co-sign his one-bedroom Astoria apartment.\nThe nasty feud comes as Cuomo, who\u2019s running as an independent in November after a humiliating loss to Mamdani in the Democratic mayoral primary, hopes to take the wind out of his rival\u2019s sails.\nThe bare-knuckle Cuomo clearly hopes a scorched-earth campaign will make up much needed ground, said Andrew Kirtzman, managing director of the consulting firm Actum.\n\u201cIt seems like (Cuomo) thinks he\u2019s getting traction with these rent-stabilization attacks,\u201d Kirtzman said.\n\u201cMaybe he has, maybe he hasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think that most New Yorkers are going to become as outraged over this as Cuomo wants them to be.\u201d\nBut Cuomo hitting Mamdani where he lives \u2014 and proposing \u201cZohran\u2019s Law\u201d targeting supposedly privileged New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized homes \u2014 has clearly irked the usually sunny socialist.\nThe speakers at Mamdani\u2019s event \u2014 a Who\u2019s Who of progressive Big Apple lawmakers, including Public Advocate Jumaane Williams \u2014 attacked Trump for pushing a 40% cut to Big Apple housing assistance.\nMamdani, who pulls $142,000 a year as a state assemblyman and lives in a $2,300-a-month rent-stabilized Astoria apartment, himself focused on Cuomo\u2019s proposed law.\nHe noted Cuomo is calling to require New Yorkers wanting a rent-stabilized apartment to spend at least 30% of their income, which is the level that experts and US Census Bureau consider households to be rent-burdened.\n\u201cThis policy is indicative of so much of Andrew Cuomo\u2019s politics, where it works backwards from a petty vindictiveness, and it does not care who it harms in the process,\u201d Mamdani said.\nMamdani\u2019s spokeswoman Dora Pekac declined to comment on the candidate\u2019s lease, but was unapologetic about linking Cuomo and Trump.\n\u201cAndrew Cuomo has called the president for political advice, aligned himself closely with him on matters personal and political, and is co-signing his dangerous authoritarian spirals,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPut simply: Andrew Cuomo is complicit in the terror Donald Trump is wreaking on working New Yorkers \u2014 and we must never allow our city to forget or forgive him for it.\u201d"

      "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 The doors of the Sun Fresh grocery store at E. 31st Street and Prospect Avenue were locked Tuesday morning with a note posted on the door.\n\u201cUnfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control, we are no longer, at this time, able to serve the residents of this community,\u201d read the sign posted outside. \u201cIt has always been our dream and passion to provide quality products and services in a safe, family environment. At this time, unfortunately, we are unable to do that.\u201d\nThe nonprofit Community Builders of Kansas City took ownership of the store in 2022, several years after it opened in 2018 as part of a $15 million, public/private revitalization effort of the Linwood Shopping Center.\n\"As of Aug. 12, 2025, CBKC is no longer able to serve the residents from this Midtown Sun Fresh location,\" CBKC said in a statement to KSHB 41 News reporter Alyssa Jackson. \"We have no other comments at this time.\"\nKSHB 41 has covered the grocery store for the last several years.\nSecurity concerns have plagued the store since its opening, with city officials pledging thousands in security upgrades.\nLast month, customers reported empty shelves and an odor emanating from inside the store.\nJannine Owens told KSHB 41's Alyssa Jackson on Monday she's been shopping at the store since it opened, but in recent weeks, she hasn't been able to leave with everything she needs.\n\"We need answers because at the end of the day, that don't make sense,\" Owens said.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated."

  "argos_summary": "Sun Fresh Market in Kansas City, Missouri, abruptly closed, citing 'unforeseen circumstances beyond our control' just weeks after reports highlighted its empty shelves and poor conditions. The store, part of a $15 million revitalization project, struggled with crime and safety issues despite receiving significant taxpayer funding. This closure raises concerns about similar proposals for city-owned grocery stores in New York City by mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, whose plans face skepticism regarding their feasibility and potential supply chain challenges.",
