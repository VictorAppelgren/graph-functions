  "title": "The Surprising Accounts Where Kids Can Earn 7%, 8%\u2014Even Above 10%",
  "description": "Savings accounts for kids are quietly offering the most eye-popping rates\u2014up to 10.38%. Find out how these standout offers work and where they\u2019re available.",
  "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners.\n\n\n\nHow Kids\u2019 Savings Accounts Work\u2014and What Parents Should Know\n\nKids can\u2019t open bank accounts on their own, even though youth savings accounts are designed specifically for minors. A parent or guardian must be a joint owner, and these accounts often come with special rules and their own rates.\n\nBut here\u2019s the surprise: A handful of banks and credit unions pay truly premium yields on youth accounts. In fact, the returns can be more than double what even the best adult high-yield savings accounts offer.\n\nThere are catches, though. The biggest one is the balance limit. Many child savings account only pay the top annual percentage yield (APY) on the first $500 or $1,000\u2014with any money above that earning a much lower return, or even 0%.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find that some institutions offer a one-size-fits-all youth account, while others offer different levels of account, such as basic savings for young kids and more advanced products for teens, like a checking account with a debit card.\n\nIn our research, two credit unions stood out for offering the very best youth savings account rates\u2014both available nationwide.\n\nSpectra Credit Union (10.38% APY): Spectra's Brilliant Kids Savings account is available to children up until their 18th birthday, and it pays 10.38% APY on balances up to $1,000. Anyone in the U.S. can join Spectra Credit Union by agreeing to a free one-year membership in the nonprofit American Consumer Council.\n\nSpectrum Federal Credit Union / Chevron Federal Credit Union (7.00% APY): These two credit unions are separately branded but are the same institution. You can join one or the other (but not both) by agreeing to a free one-year membership to the nonprofit Financial Fitness Association. Their MySavings Youth Account pays 7.00% APY on balances up to $1,000 and is available to individuals who are 21 or younger. Those who are at least 13 may also request an ATM card.\n\n\n\nWhere Kids Can Earn Even More on Their Savings\n\nLiving in certain parts of the country unlocks more high-yield youth savings options. Some can be opened online, while others require an in-branch visit. In all cases, eligibility depends on your location.\n\n\n\nNeighbors Credit Union (10.00% APY): Through its SMART youth program, Neighbors offers different banking privileges for different ages. Anyone from birth through age 22 can earn 10.00% APY on up to $1,000 in a SMART savings account, and those aged 13 and older can open a checking account with a debit card. Membership in Neighbors Credit Union is open to those who live or work (or have a relative who lives or works) in several Missouri and Illinois counties in the St. Louis area.\n\nAmerican Riviera Bank (10.00% APY): American Riviera's Kids Savings Account pays 10.00% APY on balances up to $500. Joint accounts with a minor must be opened in person at one of their California branches in Santa Barbara, Montecito, Goleta, Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo, or Paso Robles.\n\nJeanne D\u2019Arc Credit Union (8.00% APY): Jeanne D'Arc's M3 Money Club offers an 8.00% APY on balances up to $500. Membership in the credit union is open to residents of select Massachusetts and New Hampshire counties.\n\nBCFCU (Blue Coast Federal Credit Union) (8.00% APY): BCFCU's Student Saver Club account pays 8.00% APY on balances up to a generous $1,500 for children younger than 18. However, the funds cannot be withdrawn until August 1 of each year. To join the credit union, you must live in one of 13 Florida counties.\n\nWECU (7.00% APY): WECU, a credit union headquartered in Bellingham, Washington, offers a series of youth accounts beginning with the First Step Savings account, which is available to youths aged 0\u201319 and pays 7.00% APY on up to $500. Once they turn six, they're eligible to open a First Step Checking account, and at 15, WECU offers teen credit cards. Anyone who lives, works, or worships in the state of Washington is eligible to join WECU.\n\n\n\nAdults can\u2019t snag 7% or 10% like kids can\u2014but you can still earn historically high returns. Today\u2019s top high-yield savings accounts pay up to 5.00% APY, and our daily ranking lists 14 more options paying 4.30% or better. Or if you prefer paper checks with your savings, a money market account may fit. The best current nationwide rate is 4.80% APY, with several others paying 4.00% or higher.\n\nHave funds you can set aside for months\u2014or even a year or more? Consider a CD while rates are still high. Locking in now guarantees your return until the term ends, no matter what the Federal Reserve does with future interest rates. Today's best nationwide CDs pay up to 4.60% APY.\n\nHow We Find the Best Savings and CD Rates\n\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.\n\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

      "text": "The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act permits adults to transfer cash and/or financial securities to children using a custodial account until the minor reaches the age of majority.\nWhat Is the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)?\nThe Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) is a law that lets adults (usually parents or grandparents) give assets to a child through a special account. The law was created in 1956 and revised in 1966. Adults are allowed to transfer any type of asset, such as cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other securities, without setting up a trust. The adult opens the account in the child's name. Any asset held in the account belongs to the child. But the adult is the one who manages it until the child becomes a legal adult in their state. There is some flexibility in the way the funds can be used compared to other accounts, such as 529 plans.\nKey Takeaways\n- The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act is a way for adults to transfer assets to minor children.\n- Assets are restricted to cash and securities, such as stocks and bonds, among others.\n- The account and assets held within it belong to the child but are administered by the adult until the minor becomes of age.\nHow a UGMA Account Works\nA UGMA account functions as a type of custodial account. It's designed to hold and protect assets for the beneficiary. The donor can appoint themselves, another person, or a financial institution to the role of custodian. The custodian has the authority to buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other securities on behalf of the minor.\nUGMA accounts can be opened through a bank or brokerage institution. Friends and family can make contributions to the accounts, which carry no contribution or income limits. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, which means donors don't receive an income tax deduction. Deposits are irrevocable. This means that they become permanent transfers to the minor and the minor's account. So, the transfer cannot be reversed.\nUGMA assets are typically used to fund a child\u2019s education, but the donor can make withdrawals for just about any expenses that benefit the beneficiary. There are no withdrawal penalties. However, because UGMA assets are technically owned by the minor, they do count as assets if they apply for federal financial aid for college, possibly decreasing their eligibility.\nOnce they reach the age of majority in their state, minors are granted full access to their UGMA account. At that point, they may use the funds as they please.\nImportant\nCustodians have a fiduciary duty to manage the account in the beneficiary's best interest.\nSpecial Considerations\nThe minor or beneficiary is considered the owner of all assets in a UGMA account and the income they generate for tax purposes. But the earnings can be taxed either to the child or the parent. Reporting requirements depend on the amount of income the account generates and the beneficiary\u2019s age.\nA UGMA can affect a donor\u2019s lifetime gifting limits for tax purposes. Should a donor who acts as the custodian die before the custodial property is transferred to the minor, the entire custodial property is included in the donor's taxable estate.\nFast Fact\nUp to $18,000 per individual can be contributed free of gift tax for the calendar year 2024.\nUniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) vs. Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)\nThe terms UGMA and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) are usually used interchangeably. In fact, the UTMA, which was established in 1986, is an extension of the UGMA. There are some unique similarities between the two, in that they both require that donors name a custodian. This individual manages and invests the assets until the beneficiary comes of age. And both contend that any assets belong to the minor once gifted.\nHaving said that, there are some distinctions between the UGMA and UTMA. Custodial accounts set up under the UTMA can contain any kind of tangible or intangible asset, including real estate, works of art, and intellectual property. In contrast, UGMA accounts are limited to financial assets, such as cash, stocks, bonds, and insurance products (policies and annuities).\nThe UTMA allows children to take advantage of investing without having any associated tax burdens. The gift tax exclusion provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was up to $18,000 per person for 2024 ($17,000 for 2023) for a qualifying gift, including gifts to minors.\nUGMA vs. 529 Plans\nAs noted above, UGMA accounts come with no withdrawal penalties. This means that accounts can be used to pay for various expenses, including the costs to fund an education. But there is another type of account that parents can use to save for their children's studies\u2014notably the 529 plan.\nA 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings account that's intended solely for qualified educational expenses, including tuition, equipment, and certain living costs. Originally meant for just post-secondary education, parents can now use 529 plans for any qualified education expenses beginning in kindergarten. It also covers apprentice program expenses.\nHere's how they work. Anyone can open an account, including parents and grandparents. Unlike UGMA accounts, there are contribution limits for 529 plans, which vary by state. The limits tend to be very high, so many parents don't have to worry about hitting the ceiling. The money invested in a 529 plan is allowed to grow on a tax-deferred basis. Any withdrawals made from the account are tax-free provided they're used for qualified education expenses.\n529 plans come in two different types:\n- Prepaid Tuition Plans: These prepaid plans lock in future tuition costs at the current rate at specific colleges and universities. As such, account holders can lock in tuition prices and save money in the future.\n- Savings Plans: These accounts work just like individual retirement accounts (IRAs).\nWarning\nUGMAs are usually limited to publicly-traded financial assets, which means they cannot invest in speculative instruments, like derivatives, or buy on margin.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of UGMA\nThere are a number of benefits and drawbacks that come with using the UGMA to help save for a minor's future. We've listed some of the most common below.\nAdvantages\nOne of the main benefits of having UGMA accounts is that they're simple, easy to understand, and very easy to set up. You can do so through a financial institution or a brokerage firm. And they can be set up by anyone, including family or friends.\nUGMA accounts come with no contribution limits. Just keep in mind that there's a gift tax imposed by the IRS, which does place caps on how much individuals can set aside as a gift to others. Similarly, there are no withdrawal limits or restrictions. This means that money can be taken out at any time and for whatever reason.\nThere's more flexibility when it comes to how you can use a UGMA account. Unlike other plans, you aren't limited to using the funds or assets for things like education.\nOne of the biggest advantages is that they allow parents and others to skip the trust process. The assets placed within a UGMA account automatically become the property of the minor, which means there's no question of ownership.\nDisadvantages\nAll UGMA accounts are irrevocable. As such, once you transfer assets to the account, they become the property of the minor and are no longer yours. This means that you can't change your mind, so once the transfer is complete, it's there for good.\nUGMAs can be used against the beneficiary if they want to get any type of financial aid in the future, including student loans. That's because they're considered the child's property. If the value of the account is fairly substantial, it may decrease the amount of aid they may receive\u2014if they get any at all.\nThere are no tax benefits to owning a UGMA account. The IRS doesn't allow any tax credits or tax deductions for setting aside money in a child's UGMA like it would for a 529 plan.\nEasy to understand and set up\nNo contribution and no withdrawal limits\nProvides more flexibility\nSkips the trust process\nIrrevocable\nMay change or eliminate eligibility for financial aid\nNo tax advantages\nContribution Limits and Taxes\nAs noted above, there are no actual limits to how much you can contribute to a UGMA account. But there's an important consideration when it comes to these types of accounts: Anything you contribute to your child's UGMA account may be considered a gift.\nThe IRS puts caps on how much anyone can gift another individual. For 2024, parents can gift as much as $18,000 to their children without any tax consequences. That amount was adjusted for inflation from $17,000 for the 2023 tax year.\nBut what about taxation? Under certain circumstances, parents may report their children\u2019s UGMA accounts on their own tax returns and take advantage of the kiddie tax or the Tax on a Child's Investment and Other Unearned Income. This means that parents can report their child\u2019s income on their own tax return if the child's unearned income, including UGMA earnings, was less than $2,500 in 2023 and they were no older than 19 (or 24 if a full-time student).\nIn this case, the first $1,250 of the child\u2019s unearned income is treated as tax-free. The next $1,250 is taxed at the child\u2019s tax rate. Anything exceeding $2,500 is taxed at the parent's tax rate. If such an election isn't made or if the child\u2019s unearned income exceeded $2,500 at the end of the tax year, the minor would have to file a tax return subject to \u201ckiddie tax\u201d rules.\nHow Are Gifts to Minors Taxed?\nFinancial gifts in the amount of up to $18,000 in 2024 are exempt from taxes. Gifts in any amount over this amount per year will be taxed.\nWhat Is a Downside to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act?\nAs the assets in a UGMA account are owned by the minor, this can reduce the amount of financial aid they may receive. If the balance of the UGMA account's too high, it may disqualify them completely from any financial aid. This is true even if they haven't reached the age of majority and can't access the account until a certain date.\nWhere Can I Open a Uniform Gifts to Minors Account?\nA Uniform Gifts to Minors account is an easy-to-understand vehicle that can be opened at a brokerage institution or a bank. Anyone can contribute assets to these accounts. One thing that depositors should remember is that whatever they put into the accounts becomes irrevocable and the property of the beneficiary.\nThe Bottom Line\nThere are many ways that parents and others can help secure the financial futures of their children or other minors. The UGMA provides one way to do so. UGMA accounts are easy to open and understand and allow individuals to contribute cash and other assets to a single underaged beneficiary. They're designed to be very flexible because individuals can use them for any purpose. But there are a few caveats to these types of accounts that parents should understand. There are no tax benefits and deposits become irrevocable as soon as they're made. If you're unsure of whether this type of account is right for your beneficiary, make sure you consult a financial professional to help guide you."

Your commitment is to hold a lump-sum deposit in the account for a certain period of time, usually measured in months or years. In turn, the financial institution commits to paying you a fixed and known interest rate for the full duration of the CD.\nBecause the bank can count on having access to the funds for an extended period, it will generally pay you a higher interest rate on your balance than if the funds were in a savings or money market account, where unpredictable withdrawals and deposits are allowed.\nA four-year CD is simply a certificate of deposit that has a maturity term of about four years or 48 months, though you'll sometimes encounter CDs with odd terms, such as 45 months or 49 months. Those that qualify for our four-year rankings have terms ranging from 42 to 53 months.\nThough not as common as their three-year and five-year siblings, four-year CDs are offered by banks and credit unions across the country. Not only might a four-year certificate offer the perfect time horizon for your financial plans, but it is also important to anyone establishing a CD ladder.\nPros and Cons of a 4-Year CD\nPros\nGuaranteed yield for four years\nEntirely predictable earnings\nPotentially higher APY than alternatives\nSpending deterrent\nSafe and virtually risk-free\nCons\nIncurs penalty if withdrawn early\nOnly allows you to make a single deposit\nIf rates rise, you might wish you'd chosen a shorter CD\nIf rates drop, you might wish you'd chosen a longer CD\nFuture rate environment can't be predicted\nPros Explained\nGuaranteed yield for four years: A CD's annual percentage yield (APY) is presented to you before you open it, and once you make your deposit, you'll be locking in that return for the full duration of the CD. The bank cannot change the rate.\nEntirely predictable earnings: Because you'll know the rate, and because it's locked, you can calculate exactly how much your CD will be worth on its maturity date. Changes in financial markets or other factors in the news will have no bearing on your earnings.\nPotentially higher APY than alternatives: In some rate environments, you can earn a higher interest rate the longer you're willing to commit your funds. So when shopping around, check if stretching to a four-year CD can increase your rate.\nSpending deterrent: Because you can't make withdrawals from a CD without paying a penalty, you may be dissuaded from spending your savings on unplanned purchases.\nSafe and virtually risk-free: If you open your CD at an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union, your CD deposits of up to $250,000 per person and per institution are protected, even if the institution fails.\nCons Explained\nIncurs penalty if withdrawn early: If you need to cash out your CD before maturity, you can do so, but you'll be charged an early withdrawal penalty. The amount of that penalty will be spelled out in your CD agreement, which you should review before committing your funds, as penalty policies can vary widely across institutions.\nOnly allows you to make a single deposit: The vast majority of CDs are designed to take one initial deposit that is kept on hold through the CD's term. Only niche \"add-on\" CDs offer the ability to deposit additional funds.\nIf rates rise, you might wish you'd chosen a shorter CD: If you lock in your 4-year CD rate and then rates climb higher, you may wish you had opted for a shorter CD so you could have gotten out of your current rate sooner and opened a new CD at a higher rate.\nIf rates drop, you might wish you'd chosen a longer CD: If rates go down after you lock in a 4-year CD, you may wish you'd gone for a 5-year term instead, to retain your rate further into the future.\nFuture rate environment can't be predicted: Only very occasionally is it clear where interest rates are headed. Most of the time, anything is possible months or years down the road, making it difficult to gauge what the best CD moves are at any given time.\nOpening a certificate with a shorter term may be a better choice if you're not entirely confident you can leave the funds on deposit for a full four years. Also, sometimes you can score a higher rate on a shorter CD than on a longer one. It depends on the current rate environment, and also what promotional CDs might be available in the marketplace.\nIf you open a shorter-term CD, you can always cash it in when it matures and open a new CD. But you may find that rates have dropped. If rates are now higher, it's great news. But if rates are lower than when you opened your initial CD, you may wish you'd locked in your rate for four years instead of the shorter term.\nHigh-Yield Savings and Money Market Accounts\nKeeping your cash in a savings or money market account offers much more flexibility than a CD, with no risk of an early withdrawal penalty. You'll be able to add and withdraw funds more or less as often as you like.\nThe trade-off, however, is that your interest rate on a liquid account can change at any time. So if rates are declining, the annual percentage yield on your high-yield savings or money market account will almost certainly go down, while any rate on a CD will hold.\nIn addition, liquid accounts typically don't offer as high a return as CDs. By committing your funds to a certain CD term, you can usually boost your earnings, and sometimes quite substantially.\nBond Products\nVarious types of bonds are also possibilities for your cash savings. Some, like U.S. Treasury savings bonds and Treasury notes, are very similar to CDs in that the rate is typically predictable if you hold the bond until maturity. They are also backed by the federal government, so like CDs, they are exceptionally safe.\nU.S. Treasury I bonds, however, only have a fixed rate for six months at a time. Twice a year, the rate is adjusted based on the current inflation rate (hence the name I bond). Like a CD, I bonds have an early withdrawal penalty, but it's a mild three months' worth of interest. Also, unlike a CD, you cannot for any reason cash in an I bond during its first 12 months.\nOther bond options are municipal and corporate bonds of various lengths. But the easiest way for most people to buy these is through a bond mutual fund or bond ETF (exchange-traded fund) that bundles many bonds together. Some of these even include hundreds or thousands of bonds in a certain category, making them an index fund of bonds. By going this route, you can make investments and withdrawals at will, rather than having to be concerned with maturity dates.\nImportant\nWhen CD shopping, stay open-minded about the maturity term you're seeking. Not only do some institutions offer odd-term CDs with better rates (think 35 months or 49 months), but it's also true that some banks will offer a promotional CD that, despite having a much shorter term, actually offers a higher rate than the term you're looking to open.\nThe Stock Market\nIf you know you won't need your funds for four years, you could consider investing in stocks instead. The upside is that you could potentially earn quite a bit more in the stock market than with a fixed four-year CD rate.\nThe notable downside, of course, is that you can always lose money in the stock market, including scenarios where you lose most of your investment. So while CDs won't return as much as equities in a bullish stock market period, on the flip side they are guaranteed to grow, with no risk of you losing your initial principal.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhen Is a 4-Year CD a Good Idea?\nThere are two main reasons to consider a CD that's four years in length. The first is based on your personal timeline. If you know you can lock up the funds for a number of years, but five years is a bit too long because you'll need the funds sooner than that, a four-year term can get you close to those five-year yields while shortening the time until you can access the funds.\nThe second reason to buy a four-year CD is if you are building a five-year CD ladder. This is explained in more depth below, but in short, it involves buying an array of different CD terms, in yearly durations of up to five years. Hence, you'll need one four-year CD to complete the group.\nWhat If I Need My Money Before Maturity?\nYou can typically withdraw your money from a CD at just about any time, but it may take up to a week to get your money and it will come at a price.\nSince the entire premise of a CD is that the bank is paying you a better interest rate in exchange for your agreement that you'll keep the funds on deposit until maturity, cashing the CD in early means you are breaking your end of the deal. The result is called an early-withdrawal penalty, and like rates, the penalties vary tremendously across institutions.\nMost types of penalties make you forfeit some months of earned interest. This can be as few as one month or as long as 24 months. Generally, the longer the CD term, the more months of interest you'll be penalized.\nEven worse are early withdrawal policies that calculate the penalty as a percentage of your balance because these can dip into your principal. You should always avoid any CD with a penalty that can reduce your principal.\nBe sure to look into the early withdrawal policy for any CD you're considering. If you find yourself trying to decide between two fairly similar CDs, it's wise to go with the one assessing a milder penalty, just in case an emergency arises and you find yourself needing to withdraw.\nWhat Is a CD Ladder?\nThe term CD ladder refers to a strategy designed to maximize the amount of interest you can earn over a long period of time, while still giving you access to a portion of the funds every year. For a five-year CD ladder, you'll invest one-fifth of the total funds into five different CD durations (e.g., the rungs of the ladder) and eventually use the proceeds of each maturing CD into a five-year CD, since those certificates typically pay the highest rates.\nLet's say you want to keep $50,000 invested in safe, reliable CDs for capital preservation. Instead of investing it all in a single five-year CD and having no access to the full amount for that time, you can build a five-year CD ladder by putting $10,000 into a one-year CD, $10,000 into a two-year CD, and so forth, until you have five $10,000 CDs all maturing a year apart.\nEach year, when one of the CDs matures, those funds are used to buy a new five-year CD to earn a higher yield and continue the ladder. After the fourth maturity, you'll still have five certificates, but they will now comprise a portfolio of only five-year CDs, with one available for withdrawal every year.\nHow Do Banks and Credit Unions Differ?\nYou can open a certificate of deposit at almost any bank or credit union. And for the most part, there is little difference between CDs from these different institution types. Indeed, both banks and credit unions offer the same level of deposit insurance ($250,000 per individual) should the institution fail.\nThe biggest difference is that opening any account at a credit union requires you to first become a member since credit unions are member-owned not-for-profit organizations. Further, you'll find that the rules of eligibility for membership are unique to each credit union, with some based on where you live, while others are based on where you work.\nAll of the credit union CDs in our rankings are from credit unions that allow anyone nationwide to join regardless of where you live or work. However, doing so sometimes requires a small donation or fee.\nStill, joining a particular credit union can be worth it, as many credit unions make up the top ranks in various CD terms. In particular, the longer the term you're shopping for, the better served you'll be by staying open-minded to a credit union CD.\nFinancial Institutions We Review\nWe researched and reviewed more than 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

      "text": "The annual percentage yield (APY) is the interest rate earned on an investment in one year, including compounding interest.\nWhat Is Annual Percentage Yield (APY)?\nThe annual percentage yield (APY) is the interest rate earned annually (including compounding interest) on an investment in one year. A higher APY is better, as your return will be higher. You can compare APYs at different financial institutions to ensure you're opening an account with the highest possible return.\nKey Takeaways\n- APY is the actual rate of return that will be earned in one year if interest is compounded.\n- Compound interest is added periodically to the total invested, increasing the balance.\n- The more often interest is compounded, the higher the APY will be.\n- APY is similar to the annual percentage rate (APR), but APR is typically used in the context of loans.\n- The APY on checking, savings, and certificate of deposit (CD) holdings will vary across products and may have a variable or fixed rate.\nFormula and Calculation of Annual Percentage Yield (APY)\nAPY standardizes the rate of return across products. It does this by stating the real percentage of growth that will be earned in compound interest, assuming that the money is deposited for one year. The formula for calculating APY is:\nAPY=(1+nr)n\u22121where:r=Nominal raten=Number of compounding periods\nWhat APY Can Tell You\nAny investment is ultimately judged by its rate of return, whether it's a certificate of deposit (CD), a share of stock, or a government bond. The rate of return is simply the percentage of growth in an investment over a specific period, usually one year.\nHowever, rates of return can be difficult to compare across different investments if they have different compounding periods. One may compound daily, while another compounds quarterly or biannually.\nComparing rates of return by simply stating the percentage value of each over one year gives an inaccurate result, as it ignores the effects of compounding interest. It is critical to know how often that compounding occurs, since the more often a deposit compounds, the faster the investment grows.\nThis is due to the fact that every time interest compounds, the amount is added to the principal balance, and future interest payments are calculated on that larger principal amount.\nAPY vs. Interest Rate: Comparing the APY on Two Investments\nSuppose you are considering whether to invest in a one-year zero-coupon bond that pays 6% upon maturity or a high-yield money market account that also pays a 6% rate, but with monthly compounding.\nAt first glance, the yields appear equal because they are both stated as 6%. But when the effects of compounding are included, the money market investment actually yields a higher APY: (1 + .005)12 - 1 = 0.06168 = 6.17% APY.\nImportant\nComparing two investments by their simple interest rates doesn't work, as it ignores the effects of compounding interest and how often that compounding occurs.\nAPY vs. APR\nAPY is similar to the annual percentage rate (APR) used for loans. The APR reflects the effective percentage that the borrower will pay over a year in interest and fees for the loan. APY and APR are both standardized measures of interest rates expressed as an annualized percentage, but they're used on different types of products.\nIn general, APY refers to an increase in your money. APR refers to money that you have to pay.\nHowever, APY takes into account compound interest while APR does not. Furthermore, the equation for APY does not incorporate account fees, only compounding periods. That's an important consideration for an investor, who must consider any fees that will be subtracted from an investment's overall return.\nExample of APY\nIf you deposited $100 for one year at 5% interest and your deposit was compounded quarterly, at the end of the year you would have $105.09. If you had been paid simple interest, you would have had $105.\nThe APY would be (1+4.05)4\u22121=.05095=5.095%.\nAt 5% a year with interest compounded quarterly, that adds up to 5.095%. If you left that $100 for four years and it was being compounded quarterly, your initial deposit would have grown to $121.99. Without compounding, it would have been $120. That's not too dramatic, because we're talking about a small amount, but with greater balances and additional deposits the difference becomes significant.\nX=D(1+nr)(ny)=$100(1+4.05)16=$100(1.21989)=$121.99where:X=Final amountD=Initial depositr=Nominal raten=Number of compounding periods per yeary=Number of years\nHow Compound Interest Works\nThe premise of APY is rooted in the concept of compounding. Compound interest is the financial mechanism that allows investment returns to earn returns of their own.\nImagine investing $1,000 at 6% compounded monthly. At the start of your investment, you have $1,000. After one month, your investment will have earned one month's worth of interest at 6%. Your investment will now be worth $1,005 ($1,000 * (1 + .06/12)). At this point, we have not yet seen compounding interest.\nAfter the second month, your investment will have earned a second month of interest at 6%. However, this interest is earned on both your initial investment as well as your $5 interest earned last month.\nTherefore, your return this month will be greater than last month because your investment basis will be higher. Your investment will now be worth $1,010.03 ($1,005 * (1 + .06/12)). Notice that the interest earned this second month is $5.03, which is greater than the $5.00 from last month.\nAfter the third month, your investment will earn interest on the $1,000, the $5.00 earned from the first month, and the $5.03 earned from the second month. This demonstrates the concept of compound interest: the monthly amount earned will continually increase as long as the APY doesn't decrease and the investment principal is not reduced.\nFast Fact\nBanks in the U.S. are required to include the APY when they advertise their interest-bearing accounts. That tells potential customers exactly how much money a deposit will earn if it is deposited for 12 months, making it easy to compare high-yield savings accounts, CDs, money market accounts, and other products.\nVariable APY vs. Fixed APY\nSavings and checking accounts may have either a variable or fixed APY. A variable APY can be changed by the financial institution at any time; they usually fluctuate with macroeconomic conditions. A fixed APY does not change (or changes much less frequently).\nOne type of APY isn't necessarily better than the other. While locking into a fixed APY sounds appealing, it could also mean missing out on higher rates if the Federal Reserve increases rates and APYs rise. But if rates drop, locking in a long-term fixed-rate CD, for example, could be a wise more.\nMost savings, money market, and checking accounts have variable APYs, although some promotional bank accounts or bank account bonuses may have a higher fixed APY up to a specific level of deposits. For example, a bank may reward 5% APY on the first $500 deposited, then pay 1% APY on all other deposits.\nAPY and Risk\nGenerally, investors are awarded higher yields when they take on greater risk or agree to make sacrifices. The same can be said for the APY of checking and savings accounts, as well as certificates of deposit.\nWhen a consumer holds money in a checking account, they're asking to have their money on demand to pay for expenses. At any time, they may need to buy groceries or pay other expenses, drawing from their account. For this reason, checking accounts often have the lowest APYs because there is no risk or sacrifice for the consumer.\nWhen a consumer holds money in a savings account, they may not have an immediate need for it. Savings accounts typically have higher APYs than checking accounts because consumers generally tend to leave money in them longer, allowing the bank to use it to make loans and earn interest.\nGoing even further, when consumers hold a certificate of deposit, they agree to sacrifice liquidity and access to funds in return for a higher APY. CDs usually have an early withdrawal penalty, so consumers are incentivized to leave the money untouched for the entire term. The APYs on CDs are often the highest as the consumer is being rewarded for sacrificing immediate access to their funds.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat Is APY and How Does It Work?\nAPY is the annual percentage yield, which shows the actual gain on an investment (like money in a savings account) over one year. It considers the continual compounding of interest earned on your initial investment every year, compared to simple interest rates, which do not reflect compounding.\nWhat Is a Good APY Rate?\nAPY rates fluctuate often, and a good rate at one time may not be a good rate later. Generally, when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the annual percentage yield (APY) on deposit accounts tends to increase. Therefore, APY rates on savings accounts are usually better when monetary policy is tight or tightening. There are often low-cost, high-yield savings accounts that consistently deliver competitive APYs.\nHow Is APY Calculated?\nAPY standardizes the rate of return. It does this by stating the real percentage of growth that will be earned in compound interest, assuming that the money is deposited for one year. The formula for calculating APY is (1 + r/n)ny, where r is the period rate, n is the number of compounding periods, and y is the number of years.\nHow Can APY Assist an Investor?\nAny investment is ultimately judged by its rate of return, whether it's a certificate of deposit, a share of stock, or a government bond. APY allows an investor to compare different returns for different investments on an apples-to-apples basis, allowing them to make a more informed decision.\nWhat Is the Difference Between APY and APR?\nAPY is usually used to describe money that you earn, such as with savings accounts. It calculates the rate earned in one year if interest is compounded, providing an accurate representation of the actual rate of return. APR is usually used to describe money that you owe, such as on loans. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction, but it does not account for the compounding of interest within a specific year. Rather, it is a simple interest rate.\nThe Bottom Line\nAPY is the actual rate of return you will earn on an investment or bank account. Unlike simple interest calculations, APY takes into account the compounding effect of prior interest earned, generating future returns. For this reason, APY will often be higher than simple interest, especially if the account compounds frequently."

      "text": "What Is a Custodial Account?\nThe term \"custodial account\" generally refers to a child's or teen's savings account at a financial institution, mutual fund company, or brokerage firm managed by one person for the benefit of another. Generally, an adult controls a custodial account for a minor (a person under the age of 18 or 21 years, depending on the laws of the state of residence). Approval from the custodian is mandatory for the account to conduct transactions, such as buying or selling securities.\nKey Takeaways\n- A custodial account usually is a savings account set up and administered by an adult for a minor.\n- Custodial accounts have enormous flexibility, with no income, contribution limits, or withdrawal penalties.\n- Custodial accounts don't require distributions at any point.\n- Gifts to a custodial account are irrevocable, meaning they can't be adjusted or reversed.\n- Depending on their state of residence, the account's holdings irrevocably pass into the minor's control when they come of age.\nIn a broader sense, a custodial account can mean any account maintained by a fiduciarily responsible party on behalf of a beneficiary, such as an employer-based retirement account handled for eligible employees by a plan administrator. A fiduciary is bound ethically and legally to act in the best interest of another.\nEach state has specific regulations governing the age of majority and the naming of custodians and alternative custodians.\nHow a Custodial Account Works\nOnce established, a custodial account functions like any other account at a bank or brokerage. The custodian\u2014a designated manager or investment advisor\u2014decides how to invest the money. The account manager or other entities can continue contributing to the fund.\nAs noted above, custodial accounts can invest in a variety of assets. Some even offer cryptocurrency investing. However, financial institutions generally do not allow the manager to use the account to trade on margin or buy futures, derivatives, or other highly speculative investments.\nOnce the minor reaches the legal age of adulthood in their state, control of the account is officially transferred to the named beneficiary from the custodian. At that point, the beneficiary can claim full control and use of the funds. Should the minor die before the age of majority, the account will become part of the child's estate.\nTypes of Custodial Accounts\nThere are two types of custodial accounts: the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) and the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA). The UTMA is allowed in all states except Vermont and South Carolina. The UGMA is allowed in all 50 states.\nA UTMA account can hold virtually any kind of asset, including real estate, intellectual property, and works of art. However, it is limited to financial assets such as cash, securities (stocks, bonds, mutual funds), annuities, and insurance policies.\nIn either type of custodial account, you set up the account in the minor's name. You also specify the designated custodian\u2014usually the child's parent or guardian. Initial investments, minimum account balances, and interest rates vary by the company that houses the account.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Custodial Accounts\nCustodial accounts offer advantages, including tax advantages, compared to noncustodial accounts. However, they also have downsides, including the risk that the account will limit the amount the child can receive in financial aid from a college because it is considered an asset owned by the minor.\nAdvantages of Custodial Accounts\nYet custodial accounts offer big benefits. For one, custodial accounts have enormous flexibility. There are no limits on the custodian\u2019s eligibility to contribute based on their income. There are no contribution limits. And there are no requirements to make regular distributions at any point. Also, there are no withdrawal penalties.\nWhile all withdrawn funds are restricted to being used \"for the benefit of the minor,\" this requirement is vague and isn't limited to educational costs, as with college savings plans. The custodian may use the funds for everything from providing a place to live to paying for clothing as long as the beneficiary receives a benefit.\nTip\nA custodial account is much simpler and less expensive to establish than a trust fund. The aim of both UGMA and UTMA regulations was to allow adults to transfer assets to minors without the need to establish a special trust to enable such ownership.\nTax Advantages\nWhile not tax-deferred like IRAs, custodial accounts have some tax advantages known as the kiddie tax. The IRS considers the minor child the owner of the account, so the earnings are taxed at the child's tax rate up to a certain point. Every child under 19 years old\u201424 for full-time students\u2014who files as part of their parent's tax return is allowed a certain amount of \"unearned income\" at a reduced tax rate.\nFor 2025, the first $1,350 of unearned income is tax-free and income over $1,350 is subject to the child\u2019s tax rate, up from $1,300 of unearned income tax-free and income over $1,300 subject to taxation in 2024. An individual can contribute up to $19,000 for the 2025 tax year (up from $18,000 for 2024) without incurring the federal gift tax.\nDisadvantages of Custodial Accounts\nA minor's ownership of the custodial account can be a double-edged sword. Because the holdings count as assets, they may reduce a child's financial aid eligibility when they apply for college. It could also reduce their ability to access other forms of government or community aid.\nAny deposits or gifts made to the account are irrevocable, meaning they can't be changed or reversed. All the account's holdings pass, irrevocably, to the minor at the age of majority. In contrast, many college savings plans, such as 529 accounts, allow parents to retain control of the funds.\nCustodial accounts aren't as tax-sheltered as other accounts. To mitigate a tax bite, a custodian can transfer education funds to an eligible 529 plan. However, to do so, the custodian must liquidate any non-cash investments in the custodial account.\nAlso, the custodial account beneficiary can't be altered. In contrast, the beneficiary of a 529 college plan may be changed, with some limitations. A custodial account is set up in the minor's name. Because the account is irrevocable, the beneficiary of the account may not change, and no gifts or contributions made into the account can be reversed.\nPros & Cons of a Custodial Account\nEasy to establish and manage\nFree from income, contribution, or withdrawal limits\nCan invest in a variety of assets\nLess tax-advantaged than some comparable accounts like 529s\nCan hurt child's financial aid prospects\nIrrevocably passes to child upon their reaching majority age\nExamples of a Custodial Account\nMost brokerages, both digital and brick-and-mortar, offer custodial accounts. Many custodial account terms resemble those of regular, non-tax-advantaged accounts for individuals.\nFor example, at Merrill Edge\u2014the digital broker platform that used to be Merrill Lynch\u2014a UGMA/UTMA custodial account can be set up online with funds directly transferred from a checking or savings account at Bank of America, Merrill's parent company. There are no annual account fees or minimum investment amounts.\nYou can also open custodial deposit and checking accounts at most bank branches.\nCompare the Best Custodial Accounts\n| Company | Account Type | Annual Fees | Initial Investment |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Charles Schwab | Brokerage account | $0 | $0 |\n| Vanguard | Brokerage account | $25 annual account service fee (can be waived) | Minimum initial investment of $3,000 for most Vanguard mutual funds |\n| Acorns | Brokerage account | Plans start at $3 per month | $0 |\n| Ally Bank | Online savings account | $0 | $0 |\nRetirement Security Rule: What It Is and What It Means for Investors\nThe Retirement Security Rule, also known as the fiduciary rule, is meant to protect investors from conflicts of interest when receiving investment advice that the investor uses for retirement savings.\nThe rule was issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on Apr. 23, 2024. It took effect on Sept. 23, 2024, but the effective date of certain conditions is delayed to 2025.\nThe rule affects people who are saving and investing for retirement and who use an advisor who acts as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Those advisors are subject to the higher standard\u2014the fiduciary \"best advice\" standard rather than the lower, merely \"suitable advice\" standard. The designation can limit the products and services they are allowed to sell to clients who are saving for retirement.\nHowever, the rule will not affect custodial accounts. \u201cThe Department of Labor [which enforces ERISA rules] does not have jurisdiction over UGMA or UTMA accounts, so [the new] Retirement Security Rule does not have any impact on custodial accounts,\u201d said Phil Korenman, head of individual investors for T. Rowe Price.\nCan You Withdraw Money From a Custodial Account?\nYes, money can be withdrawn from custodial accounts, as long as it is used \"for the benefit of the minor,\" a vague term that includes, but isn't limited to, educational costs.\nWhat Do You Do With a Custodial Account When Your Child Turns 18?\nThe account is transferred to the child once they reach the age of majority, which is either 18 or 21, depending on the state.\nHow Do I Get a Custodial Account?\nIf you are under 18 or 21, depending on the state, an adult can open a custodial account for you. The person who opens the account will manage it until you reach the age of majority or a designated later age, at which point it is transferred over to you, and you are responsible for its management.\nHow Is a Custodial Account Taxed?\nChildren file as part of their parent's tax return, generally. For the 2025 year, any unearned income, interest, and dividends over the $3,150 threshold may be taxed at a 10% rate (up from $2,600 for 2024).\nThe Bottom Line\nA custodial account is a means by which an adult can open a savings or brokerage account for a child. The adult who opens the account is responsible for managing it, including making investment decisions and deciding how the money is to be used, as long as it benefits the child. There are specific tax advantages to a custodial account, but there are also risks, such as the possibility that the account's existence limits the amount of financial aid a child might get for college. Weigh the pros and cons before deciding to open a custodial account.\nHow We Picked the Best Custodial Accounts\nWe researched 10 companies offering custodial accounts and evaluated each on minimum opening deposit as well as fees, including account maintenance fees, transfer fees, and enrollment fees. We also considered the company\u2019s history, customer service, and ease of use of the company\u2019s websites or apps. Lastly, we also looked at the educational resources provided by the different companies. Financial literacy is important for adults and their children who will be taking control of their custodial accounts, usually between 18 and 21 years of age. Our review prioritized companies with low fees, strong educational resources for adults and children, as well as convenient and easy-to-use platforms."

When ranking high-yield savings account rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best savings account, like minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best high-yield savings account rates since 2019.\nWhat Is a High-Yield Savings Account?\nAs the name implies, high-yield savings accounts pay much higher interest rates than traditional ones. Often offered online, whether by an internet-only bank or the online division of a brick-and-mortar bank, they're a type of savings account that's based on the idea of holding your savings wherever it can earn a competitively high yield, even if that's a different bank than where you hold your checking account.\nThe difference in savings account interest rates can be dramatic, with the top accounts in the country typically offering 10 to 12 times the national average rate. And you can still keep your checking account where it is, because it's simple to link a high-yield savings account to your primary account for easy transfers.\nReasons to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nStashing some of your cash in a savings account is smart whether you're saving for something specific, or just want to sock money away for when you'll need it in the future. Here are some common reasons to open a savings account:\nBuild an emergency fund: By putting your emergency money in a high-yield account, you'll be able to boost your balance with monthly interest earnings, while also leaving your funds fully accessible should a financial emergency arise.\nReach a specific goal: This may include buying a house or a car, sending your son or daughter to college, or going on a special vacation.\nGrow your savings: Earning interest on your money means your savings balance will grow faster than if you were making monthly contributions and not earning anything.\nExpert Take\nI first opened a high-yield savings account with American Express in 2019, and have urged friends and family to open high-yield savings accounts, too. While Amex doesn't offer the top rate nationwide, it has a great mobile app, which is how I do most of my banking. I can see my high-yield savings account right next to my credit cards, and can easily deposit money from my checking to my savings via the app. ~Hilarey Gould, Editorial Director at Investopedia\nHow Much Will a High-Yield Savings Account Pay on $1,000, $5,000, or Higher Balances?\nThe amount of money you can earn in a high-yield savings account will be based on how much you deposit and what your interest rate is. Based on initial deposits of different amounts from $1,000 to $100,000, we calculate below what your balance would be at the end of one year if you put the funds in a top-paying high-yield savings account, paying 5.00%, vs. a savings account paying the national average of 0.39% APY.\nWarning\nNote that while you can earn a great deal more than the national average rate, your bank may also pay a lot less. For instance, Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo all pay close to zero interest on their traditional savings accounts, at just 0.01% APY.\nAPY\n$1,000 balance\n$2,500 balance\n$5,000 balance\n$10,000 balance\n$20,000 balance\n$50,000 balance\n$100,000 balance\n1 year of earnings at the national average rate\n0.39%\n$1,004\n$2,510\n$5,019\n$10,039\n$20,078\n$50,195\n$100,391\n1 year of earnings at today's top rate\n5.00%\n$1,050\n$2,625\n$5,250\n$10,500\n$21,000\n$52,500\n$105,000\nAdded earnings from HYSA\n+ $46\n+ $115\n+ $231\n+ $461\n+ $922\n+ $2,305\n+ $4,609\nOf course, you can boost your balance even more by regularly adding deposits to your savings account. One smart way to do this is to set up an automated transfer from your checking account once a month.\nHow to Choose the Best High-Yield Savings Account\nOnce you've decided to open up a new high-yield savings account, you'll want to do your homework to make sure you're choosing the best one for your needs. Searching for a top annual percentage yield (APY) is a good starting point when choosing a high-yield savings account, as you'll want to earn a competitive rate.\nThough the interest rate can change, it makes sense to choose an account that is paying one of the highest rates in the country, since the higher your rate, the more interest you'll collect every month and every year. Also, through the power of compounding, you can make interest off your interest, and the higher the APY on your account, the better.\nBut beyond the interest rate, you'll also want to make sure the account either doesn't have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that you feel confident you can regularly maintain. Also, note if there is a minimum balance required to earn the top APY.\nWhy Different Banks Pay Different Rates\nEach bank is a business that has different needs for customer deposits, operating in its own regional market. As a result, some banks have to work harder to attract funds, such as smaller banks with names you may not be familiar with.\nAlso important is the lending activity the bank is undertaking. If, for instance, a bank is in a strategic push to build its commercial lending portfolio, it will need to attract more customer deposits in order to fund those loans it hopes to make. One way they can do this is offering a promotional APY for a short period to boost their deposits balance, but then lowering it after they've accumulated enough funds.\nCommon Savings Account Terms to Understand\nWhen researching high-yield savings accounts to find the best one for you, be sure you understand what these commonly used terms mean.\nMinimum opening deposit or initial deposit: Some bank accounts\u2014whether a savings, checking, or money market account\u2014stipulate a minimum deposit you need to make to open the account. It could be quite low, like $25, or could be as much as $25,000 for some high-balance accounts. And some accounts have no requirement, letting you open the account with no money deposited. Note that if an account has a initial deposit requirement but then no minimum ongoing balance, you do not need to keep that money at the bank after your initial deposit.\nMinimum balance requirement or ongoing balance: Unlike a minimum initial deposit, a minimum balance requirement refers to the least amount of money you can keep in the account on an ongoing basis. For instance, a bank may require your balance to stay at or above $100 or $1,000 for its account\u2014or any other amount the bank prefers. Falling below the minimum requirement could mean being hit with a fee, or could instead mean you won't earn the high-yield interest rate on the account. So be sure the account you choose either has no minimum ongoing balance or one that you feel confident you can always stay above.\nMonthly maintenance fee: Banks and credit unions charge various types of fees. Unlike ones triggered by a transaction, such as an insufficient funds fee or a wire transfer fee, the monthly service fee is a standard fee you could be charged every statement cycle. Many accounts do not have a monthly maintenance fee, while some others provide ways for you to avoid the fee each month. Be sure you understand the fee rules for any account you're considering.\nMobile check deposit: The ability to deposit checks using the camera on your smartphone or tablet\u2014rather than having to take the check to a branch\u2014is called mobile check deposit or remote check deposit. Most institutions' mobile apps offer this as an easy way to get money deposited into your account.\nExternal or ACH transfer: The electronic process of moving funds between two financial institutions is called an external or ACH transfer. Virtually every high-yield savings account allows you to send or receive external transfers so that you can easily move money in and out of your savings account.\nHow to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nAfter comparing the best high-yield savings account and landing on a choice, the next step is to open the account online. Here's how that generally works:\nThe bank or credit union will ask you to provide various personal information, including your social security number, since your interest earnings will be reportable to the IRS.\nThe bank's account opening process will also involve security measures designed to ensure you are who you say you are.\nYou'll also be presented with one or more options on how to fund your account. The most common method is by ACH transfer from another bank, and you'll be provided with instructions on how to set this up.\nAlternatively, some institutions allow you to make your initial deposit with a debit card, a credit card, or even a paper check sent through the mail.\nOnce the application process is completed, you may be able to set up online banking right away, or you may need to wait a day or two for your account to be fully opened.\nTip\nTransfers between different institutions will take one to three days to complete, so be sure to keep enough of a cash cushion either in your checking account or in a linked savings account at that same institution. That way you won\u2019t run into trouble if you can\u2019t get funds from your high-yield account for a couple of days.\nPros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts\nPros\nHigher APY than traditional savings accounts\nAbility to withdraw or deposit funds at any time\nExtremely safe, with virtually no risk\nExcellent vehicle for an emergency fund or saving for a big goal\nIn times of rising rates, your APY may go up\nCons\nEarning a top yield may require opening an account with a new institution\nSome accounts have withdrawal limits of six per month\nEasy access can make it tempting to dip into savings\nAccount could have a fee or minimum balance requirement\nIn times of decreasing rates, your APY may go down\nWho Is a High-Yield Savings Account Best For?\nAnyone with surplus savings in the bank can benefit from a high-yield savings account. If you have more money in the bank than you need to hold in your checking account, high-yield savings accounts offer a way to sock some of those funds away to earn an especially high annual percentage yield (APY). High-yield savings accounts are also well suited to those comfortable with internet or mobile banking, as moving money in and out of an online savings account must generally be done on your computer or via a mobile banking app on your phone.\nWhen choosing the best savings account for you, you'll want to check the rules of the account, such as whether it limits the number of withdrawals you can make in a month, and if you'll be assessed a monthly maintenance fee. Lastly, check that the bank is an FDIC member (or an NCUA member if it's a credit union) so that your money is insured by the federal government\u2014up to $250,000 per depositor\u2014should the bank or credit union fail. Online reviews of a bank's customer service may also prove useful.\nAlternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts\nHigh-yield savings accounts are just one vehicle for stashing your cash, and they often pay the highest APYs. But there are several alternatives for holding your funds until you need them.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Checking Account\nWhile the easiest place to keep surplus funds is in your checking account, this has two major downsides. First, money kept in your everyday checking account is very easy to spend, making it difficult to leave earmarked as savings. Second, checking accounts tend not to pay any interest\u2014or if they do, the rate is a pittance. A high-yield savings account offers an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on your money.\nSome high-yield or rewards checking accounts do exist, with rates that are more competitive. But these accounts require jumping through some hoops\u2014sometimes every month\u2014in order to earn their high rate. Still, if you're a heavy debit card user, one of the best rewards checking accounts may be a good option for you.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Traditional Savings Account\nThere is no formal definition of how high a rate needs to be to qualify as \"high yield\". In short, it's up to each institution how to name their savings accounts. Traditional banks and credit unions more often offer traditional savings accounts, while online banks are more likely to offer a high-yield savings account. But again, the distinctions are fuzzy, rather than hard-and-fast rules.\nWhy You Don't See Big Name Banks on Our List\nWe track the savings account rates of over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. While we do check the rates at big banks\u2014including the five largest banks of Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, and U.S. Bank\u2014their rates aren't usually high enough to make our ranking. Meanwhile, other institutions may not qualify for our ranking because they aren't available to customers in at least 40 states, or they significantly limit the balance on which you can earn their high-yield APY.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Money Market Account\nA money market account operates very much like a savings account, with the exception that it allows writing checks. In the past, money market accounts typically imposed high minimum deposit requirements in exchange for higher rates than savings accounts. This has shifted in recent years, however, with savings and money market accounts both having a variety of required minimum balances\u2014including no-minimums accounts. In addition, high-yield savings accounts often pay more competitive rates than money markets, though sometimes you can find a higher APY among the top-paying money market accounts.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"When a client has money they won't need in the next 12 to 24 months, I encourage them to take advantage of a high-yield savings account or money market account to hedge against inflation as well remove the funds from their actively used checking accounts. Basically, a 'hands off account,'\" said Sibyl Slade, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nIf some of your savings can be socked away and not touched for a period of time, you may be able to earn a higher rate with a certificate of deposit. CDs require you to commit your funds to remain on deposit for a number of months or years, imposing a penalty if you request to withdraw the funds before the CD\u2019s maturity date. But in exchange, your interest rate is locked and guaranteed, even if the Fed lowers rates. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs can lead you to the highest available APYs no matter the CD term you choose.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat does \"HYSA\" mean?\nHYSA is simply an acronym for \"high-yield savings account\". In contrast to traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts aim to attract customers and their deposits by offering a much more competitive interest rate.\nAre High-Yield Savings Accounts Safe?\nSome people wonder if you can lose money in a high-yield savings account. In a worst-case scenario, a savings account will pay no interest, meaning your funds don't grow at all. But you would never lose the money you put into the account, other than due to fees you've been assessed. So it's important to choose an account where you can easily avoid paying any fees.\nAs for losing money due to a bank failure, the vast majority of banks\u2014whether physical or online\u2014are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits per institution if the bank fails. The U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers for up to $250,000 by providing insurance through the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).\nThat means whether your institution is a traditional brick-and-mortar bank with branches or is an online bank or credit union, and whether it\u2019s big or small, your deposits up to $250,000 are equally safe and protected.\nWho Has the Highest-Paying High-Yield Savings Account?\nThe top-paying institutions for savings accounts vary, with no one bank perpetually leading the rate rankings. In general, the top rate contenders tend to be online operations, whether owned by a physical bank or set up as a fully online-only institution. You can always find today's highest rates\u2014currently near 5.00%\u2014and the institutions that offer them by regularly checking our ranking in this article. Or for a list that is exclusive to banks (no credit unions), you can check our daily ranking of the best banks for savings accounts.\nWhich Banks Are Paying 7% Interest on High-Yield Savings Accounts?\nWhile it would be nice to earn 7% on money held in savings, no banks or credit unions are paying that much on a regular savings account. The only account paying a 7% APY right now is a savings account for kids, but only on balances up to $1,000. Savings account rates surged in 2023 and 2024, thanks the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike campaign. But at its highest point, the top savings account rate available to anyone in the country reached 5.55% APY in April 2024.\nHow Much Does a High-Yield Savings Account Get Taxed?\nWhat any bank offers in interest\u2014whether paid on a savings, checking, money market, or CD account\u2014will need to be reported on your annual tax return. You'll be able to see on your monthly statement or online register how much you were paid each month, and at the end of the calendar year, it will be taxed along with all of your other income from employment and other sources.\nThe bank where you hold your high-yield savings account will not tax you directly, but in January of each year, they will send you and the IRS a Form 1099-INT indicating how much interest you were paid in the previous calendar year. You must then report this interest income on your tax return.\nDo High-Yield Savings Account Rates Change?\nThe APY on a savings account is variable, meaning what it pays when you first open your account will most likely change sometime in the future, and it can change at any time without warning.\nWhether the rate goes up or down, and how often it changes, is largely influenced by the Federal Reserve. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, banks and credit unions often follow suit in the same direction.\nThat said, rate changes among savings accounts are not typically a daily or weekly event. Barring recent moves by the Fed, rates often remain at the same level for weeks or months at a time.\nCan You Ever Lose Money With a High-Yield Savings Account?\nThe risk of losing money in a high-yield savings account is very low. Banks and credit unions are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable, but they are guaranteed based on the balance in the account (the bank won't take that money back after paying it to you). So if you're worried that a high-yield savings account comes with the same risk as investing in the stock market, think again. These accounts are much safer and there's virtually no risk of losing money in the account (unless you spend it of course).\nWhat Are the Downsides to a High-Yield Savings Account?\nThere are few drawbacks to putting some of your money into a high-yield savings account. The primary downside is that your money will likely reside at a different institution than where you do your primary banking. As a result, you may not be able to instantaneously transfer money from your high-yield savings to your primary checking account, as transfers between banks generally take 1-3 days.\nThis issue can be easily handled, however, by making sure you keep some level of cash cushion at the bank where you have your checking, enabling you to make a quick transfer to checking if you need it.\nWhich Banks Do You Track for High-Yield Savings Accounts?\nEvery business day, we check the savings account rate for about 100 banks and credit unions that offer their accounts to customers nationwide.

We determine daily rankings of the top-paying savings accounts first and foremost by the annual percentage yield (APY) offered. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the savings account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

To do this, we collect thousands of CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. We then rank the best CDs according to APYs, with the top certificates certificates typically paying three to five times as much as the national average\u2014or even more. We then also provide details on factors like CD term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit.\nTo qualify for our rankings, a CD must be available nationwide and its minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000. It must also be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union, which protects up to $250,000 in deposits per person and per institution).\nWhy You Might Not Recognize the Banks and Credit Unions in Our CD Rankings\nYou typically won't see big names like Chase, Wells Fargo, PNC, Navy Federal, or Bank of America in our rankings of the best CD rates. We research their rates, but they don't make our list simply because they don't pay enough. Extremely large banks typically don't need to attract customers and deposits like smaller institutions do, so they don't need to use rates to win business. In fact, some of the biggest banks pay interest rates very close to zero, but it depends and can change from month to month. Our best CD rates are based on careful research, and we update this article every weekday to give you the best CD rates available nationwide.\nWhat Is a CD Rate?\nA CD rate is an interest rate that shows what a bank or credit union will pay you for depositing your money with them for a certain time in a certificate of deposit (CD). For example, if the rate is 4.50% for a 1-year CD, the bank or credit union will pay you 4.50% in interest on your money for keeping it in the account, untouched, for 12 months. If you deposit $1,000 in that account and keep it there for 12 months, you will earn $45 at the end of the term.\nNote that the interest rate and the APY offered on a CD are slightly different. An interest rate is the raw rate you earn on your money, while the annual percentage yield (APY) is the full amount of interest earned after compounding at the end of one year. APYs are therefore usually higher than the interest rate. For example, an interest rate on a 3-month CD could be 4.41% while the APY on that same CD is 4.50%.\nHow Does a CD Work?\nA certificate of deposit (CD) is similar to a bank deposit account. The difference is what you're agreeing to when you sign on the dotted line (even if that signature is now digital).\nA CD works by locking your deposit up for a set time. When time is up, the CD pays you the set interest rate you agreed to when you opened it. A CD locks you into four specific things:\nThe interest rate:Most CDs pay a fixed interest rate. The bank cannot later change the rate and therefore reduce your earnings. On the flip side, a fixed interest rate may hurt you if rates later rise and you've lost your opportunity to take advantage of higher-paying CDs.\nThe term:This is the length of time you agree to leave your money deposited to avoid any penalty (such as six months or 1 year, etc.) The term ends on the \"maturity date,\" when you can withdraw your money penalty-free.\nThe principal:Except for some specialty CDs that allow add-on deposits, this is the amount you agree to deposit into the CD, at the time of opening.\nThe institution:The bank or credit union where you open your CD will determine aspects of the agreement, such as penalties for early withdrawal and whether your CD will be automatically reinvested if you don\u2019t provide other instructions at the time of maturity. Credit unions may also require you to open a high-yield savings account or money market account before you open a CD.\nOnce your CD is established and funded, the bank or credit union will set the terms and conditions, just as it does with other deposit accounts. You'll have either monthly or quarterly statement periods, paper or electronic statements, and usually monthly or quarterly interest payments deposited to your CD balance, where the interest will compound. The money you put into a CD is insured like other deposit accounts\u2014up to $250,000 per customer, per institution.\nHow Much Does a $10,000 CD Earn in One Year?\nIf you invest $10,000 in a CD for one year, you could earn at least a few hundred dollars, depending on the interest rate. For example, with an APY of 4.55%, you'd get $455 in interest after one year. CD rates can change, so locking in a high interest rate today could guarantee you the maximum earnings, especially if CD rates drop by next year.\nThere are a few scenarios you may encounter or need to decide between when it comes to investing $10,000 in a CD. It'll depend on the rate and CD term you choose. Here are a few scenarios:\nDeposit Amount\nAPY\nTerm\nEarnings\n$10,000\n5.50%\n8 months\n$363\n$10,000\n4.55%\n1 year\n$455\n$10,000\n4.40%\n3 years\n$1,378\nWho Should Get a CD?\nIf you're looking to save money for a certain amount of time and want to make sure you don't touch it until you need it, consider a top-paying CD. If you're risk-averse and don't want to invest money in the stock market because there's no guarantee you'll see a return, that's another reason to open a CD. CDs offer a fixed rate of return that guarantees your earnings until the CD's term ends. And right now, CD rates are high\u2014over 4% in many cases\u2014so you can earn a solid return on your deposit.\nCDs Can Help You Beat Inflation\nIn July 2025, inflation was 2.7%, while the top APY offered across all CDs was 4.59%. CD rates reached historic highs in 2023 as a result of the Fed's rate-hike policy to cool inflation, which had reached 9.1% in June 2022. CDs can help you combat inflation by paying you interest on your money, even though you may be paying more for goods and services. This will not always be the case, though. Interest rates are often increased to help combat high inflation. With inflation trending toward the standard 2% mark the Fed aims for each year, the federal funds rate was reduced in September for the first time in four years, then again in both November and December. CD rates have subsequently begun to decline.\nRight now, the best CD rates are still over 4.50%, which is much higher than what CD rates were just a few years ago. Buying a CD now is a good idea since you'll be able to earn a higher interest rate than you might be able to earn in a year from now. Right now, you're guaranteed a high interest rate, even if the Fed decides to lower rates during the term of your CD. Waiting to buy a CD could mean earning a lower interest rate on a CD and losing out on higher guaranteed earnings. So if you are debating whether to buy a CD or not, don't wait.\nTypes of CDs\nRegular CDs: A regular CD is a CD with a fixed interest rate for a set period. Brick-and-mortar traditional banks, as well as online institutions and credit unions, offer these kinds of CDs. They may also be called traditional CDs.\nJumbo CDs: A jumbo CD is a CD that requires a larger opening deposit, such as $50,000 or $100,000.\nNo-penalty CDs: A no-penalty CD is exactly what it sounds like\u2014you do not pay a fee for withdrawing your money early.\nBrokered CDs: A brokered CD is one that an investor can buy through a brokerage firm or from a sales representative other than a bank or credit union.\nStep-up CDs: A step-up CD allows you to increase your interest rate when you can. Your rate is not fixed for the entire term; you can capitalize on higher interest rates with a step-up CD. A step-up CD may also be called a bump-up CD.\nPromotional-rate CDs: This CD offers a promotional rate that may be higher than a regular CD rate and is only offered for a certain time period. You may be able to lock in a high rate by opening this kind of CD within a promotional period, like 30 days or before the end of the month.\nNote\nOnline banks or credit unions tend to offer high CD rates because of the lower overhead costs. If you're worried about opening an online bank account, just do your research to ensure the institution comes with FDIC or NCUA insurance. It may also be an online arm of a larger, brick-and-mortar institution, which could give you peace of mind. Big banks like Citibank, U.S. Bank, Bank of America, Chase, Capital One, Wells Fargo, American Express, and more offer CDs too, but they may not pay the highest CD rates. It's important to shop around and consider all financial institutions before choosing a CD.\nPros and Cons of CDs\nPros\nGuaranteed yield for the CD's full term: Most CDs are a fixed-rate product, so you're guaranteed to earn the rate you lock in until the CD's maturity date, no matter what the Federal Reserve does with the fed funds rate in the future.\nHigher interest rates than liquid accounts: Banks generally offer higher rates on CDs than on savings and money market accounts, in exchange for you keeping the money in the account and not touching it until you're allowed to withdraw it.\nFully predictable earnings and withdrawal date: Because you know the CD's rate and term, you can calculate exactly how much you'll earn and when you can withdraw the funds without penalty.\nExtremely safe, with almost no bank or market risk: When you open a CD at an FDIC bank or an NCUA credit union, up to $250,000 in deposits are federally protected against the institution's failure. You're also safe from the market volatility\u2014and potential loss in value\u2014that can occur with stock and bond investments.\nCan deter spending temptations: Withdrawing funds before your CD matures causes you to pay an early withdrawal penalty, which can help keep you from giving in to temptations to dip into your savings for an unplanned purchase. This means a CD could be good for building your emergency fund.\nCons\nEarly withdrawal of the funds incurs a penalty: If you do need to withdraw your CD funds before maturity, the bank or credit union will impose an early withdrawal penalty. Typically, it's calculated as a certain number of months of forfeited interest earnings.\nYou can\u2019t add to your deposit: With the rare exception of add-on CDs, you can only deposit funds into the certificate at the time of initial deposit. This means you miss out on compound interest since you're not able to grow the account and apply the interest rate to your new balance every month like with a savings account.\nIf CD rates rise, you may miss out on a higher yield: If you lock in your CD rate, but rates increase shortly after, you may wish you'd waited to score a higher return.\nIf CD rates drop, you may wish you\u2019d chosen a longer CD: Though you'll still be well-served by any CD yield you have locked in before interest rates drop, you may wish you'd locked in a longer-term CD to extend that competitive yield for a longer period.\nTypically return less than stocksover long periods: Though stock investments involve more risk and less predictability, they may offer greater returns over long periods.\nHow to Choose the Best CD for You\nWhen choosing a CD, consider the following factors:\nYour financial goals: Both short-term goals and long-term goals are important.\nHow much money you have to deposit: CDs have minimums, so if you only have $500 to deposit, you'll need to find a CD with that minimum balance requirement.\nHow long you can leave that money in the CD without touching it: This will help you determine the right term\u2014whether that's a one-year CD or a three-year CD.\nInterest rates offered for your term and minimum deposit: The higher the rate, the more you will earn on your deposit during the CD term.\nCD type: Is it a bump-up CD or a regular CD? This will ensure you're choosing one that meets your needs and goals.\nOnce you choose a CD, open the account, and deposit your money to start earning interest.\nChristine DiGangi, Investopedia Product Reviews Team\nI had two short-term savings goals, so I looked for a 6-month and a 1-year CD with a high APY that I could ladder. I checked out a few of the options on our list and decided to go with CIT Bank and Bread Savings, because applying for the CDs online was really easy, and they offered mobile apps\u2014I\u2019m one of those people who checks their financial accounts frequently, if not daily. I\u2019d keep accounts with both of them (assuming the rates are good when the two terms end).\nWhat Do You Need to Open One of the Best CDs?\nTo open a CD, you'll need some personal information including, but not limited to:\nName\nAddress\nPhone number\nFor example, the bank's customer service team may ask you to provide a copy of your license or ID if you don't have an account with that institution already.\nWhen you have that info handy, fill out the application for your CD account:\nState how you'll fund the CD, whether via an electronic transfer or another method.\nFund the CD.\nState how you want to receive the interest, all at the end or in monthly installments (if required).\nOnce you've done all that, you should officially have a CD in your name, though check with the institution to ensure you've taken all the right steps.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"Look for the best CD rates and consider laddering the term of the renewals, whenever possible to hedge for potential liquidity needs in the future and not miss opportunities to lock in potential higher rates,\" said Sibyl Slade, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council.\nHow to Build a CD Ladder\nSmart CD investors have a specific tactic for hedging against rate changes over time and maximizing their return. It's called a CD ladder and it enables you to access the higher rates typically offered on 5-year CDs, but with the twist that a portion of your money becomes available every year, rather than every five years. Here's how to do it.\nTake the amount of money you want to invest in CDs and divide it by five.\nPut one-fifth of the funds into a top-earning 1-year CD, another fifth into a top 2-year CD, another into a 3-year CD, and so forth through a 5-year CD. Let\u2019s say you have $25,000 available. That would give you five CDs of varying lengths, each with a value of $5,000.\nWhen the first CD matures in a year, you take the resulting funds and open a top-rate 5-year CD.\nOne year later, your initial 2-year CD will mature, and you'll invest those funds into another 5-year CD.\nContinue doing this every year with whichever CD is maturing until you end up with a portfolio of five CDs all earning 5-year APYs, but with one of them maturing every 12 months, keeping your money a bit more accessible than if all of it were locked up for a full five years.\nWhat Happens if I Withdraw From a CD Early?\nIf you withdraw money early from a CD, you'll likely have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. This is usually a certain number of months' worth of interest that you earned in the CD thus far. For example, if you had deposited $10,000 in a 12-month CD with a rate of 5.00%, and withdrew it early, you might have to pay three months' worth of the interest you had earned. So instead of cashing out $500 at the end of the CD term, you'd walk away with less interest earned, the exact amount depending on how early you withdrew the money.\nNow, not all CDs have early withdrawal penalties. Some no-penalty CDs are available and have more flexibility, However, they may also come with lower interest rates.\nHow Are CDs Taxed?\nJust like how the interest you earn on any money you have in savings, money market, and checking accounts is taxable as interest income at both the state and federal levels, the interest you earn on your money in a CD is too.\nYour CD earnings will be reported to the IRS in the year they were earned and posted to your account, so that's when they're taxable\u2014even though you may not withdraw the funds for one or more years into the future.\nFor example, if you have $1,000 in a 1-year CD with a 5.00% interest rate, you'll earn $50 in interest. You owe taxes on that $50, but not on the $1,000 principal you deposited at the start of the term.\nIf you decide to add a CD to your IRA, you may not have to pay taxes until you're ready to withdraw in retirement. You can add CDs in both traditional and Roth IRAs. With a Roth IRA, you are not penalized for withdrawing money from the account if it's open for at least five years because it's funded with after-tax dollars. However, if you want to withdraw money from your Roth IRA CD before it matures, you will be hit with a CD early withdrawal penalty. If your CD matures in a traditional IRA before your retirement age, then you may not be able to withdraw that money without first paying taxes and fees.\nAlternatives to CDs\nCDs vs. Traditional Savings Accounts\nTraditional savings accounts tend to offer lower interest rates. Banks or credit unions with no high-yield savings account options may only offer traditional savings accounts that pay 0.01% to 0.10%. While the national average for savings rates is 0.39%, according to the FDIC, many banks pay much less. For example, Wells Fargo's Way2Save account pays 0.01% APY and Chase offers just 0.01% with its Chase Savings account. When interest rates are high, the top CD rate can be up to 600x the rate you may earn on your money in a traditional savings account.\nCDs vs. High-Yield Savings Accounts\nIf you just aren't sold on committing your funds for a certain amount of time, or can't afford to because you may need the money in the near term, a high-yield savings account may be a better option. You'll be free to withdraw and deposit funds as you like, though some institutions will limit how many withdrawals you can make each month. Some savings accounts may also require a minimum balance.\nCDs vs. Money Market Accounts\nIf you're looking for other high-yield accounts, a money market account may serve your needs. Money market accounts offer the feature of allowing you to write checks on the account. Some money market accounts come with debit cards, but money market accounts tend to act more like savings accounts. They may also come with minimum deposit or balance requirements, and money market account rates can easily compete with savings account rates.\nCDs vs. Bonds\nIf you're interested in venturing out of the bank and into the world of bonds, you have numerous options. You could put cash savings into U.S. government I bonds, which are designed to track or beat the inflation rate. Or you could invest in U.S. Treasuries, in which you lend money to the U.S. government for a fixed amount of time. The Treasury notes with durations of four weeks to one year are called T-Bills.\nAnother option is corporate and municipal bonds. Though it's difficult to research individual bonds on your own, you can easily invest in a bond mutual fund or bond exchange-traded fund which is diversified across a bundle of different bond issues. You can also enter and exit these funds at any time.\nCDs vs. Brokerage Accounts\nIf you have a brokerage account, you can also hold savings in the brokerage\u2019s cash reserve account or their money market fund (not to be confused with the money market accounts offered by banks). Just be sure to research what rate you\u2019ll earn because in many cases, these brokerage cash accounts pay far less than what you can earn by keeping your money in an outside CD, savings account, or money market account. Some brokerages may also offer brokered CDs, another option if you're already investing with a broker and want to open a CD.\nCDs vs. Annuities\nAn annuity is a type of fixed-income investment provided by financial institutions. You can buy an annuity and pay it monthly or in a lump sum. Then, in the future, you receive fixed monthly payments. Annuities are insurance contracts that can guarantee income. While they are similar to a CD in that the income is guaranteed as long as you follow the rules of the contract, they are not as short-term as CDs may be. Annuities are most often used in retirement planning. CDs can also be used for retirement planning, but they are usually bought and held for terms of 6 months to 5 years rather than an annuity, which could be owned for 20 years or something similar. There may also be different withdrawal rules and limits and tax consequences with annuities.\nCDs vs. Treasury Bills\nTreasury bills are debt obligations backed by the U.S. government. They usually have maturities of one year or less. That timing is similar to CDs with shorter terms, but Treasury Bills may not offer the same level of return on the investment. Rates are comparable, ranging from 4.10% to 4.59% as of Nov. 7, 2024, but they can fluctuate daily.\nCD rates can also change daily. The thing with T-bills is that you buy them at a discount and when they mature, you receive the full amount back, plus a little more. For example, you might buy a $1,000 T-bill for $950. When the bill matures, you will get $1,000, or $50 more than what you paid for it. This increase of $50 is the interest you earn. CDs are a little less complicated, where you put in a set amount, and then receive a fixed interest rate when it matures.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho Is Paying the Highest CD Rate Right Now?\nThe highest CD rate right now is 4.60% APY from Connexus Credit Union. That could change, though, as interest rates fluctuate daily and institutions can offer CDs with high interest rates for as long or as short of a time as they want.\nAre CDs Safe?\nCDs are safe because they are usually offered by banks or credit unions which are insured by the FDIC or NCUA. This means your money at a bank or credit union, across all of your accounts (CDs, savings, and checking, etc.) is insured for up to $250,000. CDs also come with virtually no risk since the interest rate is usually fixed; you'll know what to returns to expect before even opening the CD.\nHow Have CD Rates Changed Over Time?\nThe top CD rates continually change, based on the U.S. interest rate environment. When the federal funds rate is low, CD rates tend to be low, and when the fed funds rate is high, CD rates tend to be high. To combat high inflation between 2021 and 2023, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee dramatically raised the fed funds rate to its highest level in more than 20 years. That in turn pushed CD rates to a peak of 6.00% in 2024. Compare that to 2021, when the top CD rate was around 1.35%.\nDo You Pay Taxes on CD Interest?\nYes, your earnings on a CD are considered interest income, and are taxed in the same way as interest earnings from a savings, money market, or checking account. The bank or credit union will send you a tax form early in the calendar year, showing how much interest you earned in the previous tax year, which you'll use to file your tax return.\nAre There Fees Associated With CDs?\nThere are not usually fees associated with the CD that you want to open. However, you may be required to open a savings account at the institution before you can open the CD there. Additionally, some credit unions ask new members to make a charitable donation in order to sign up for an account, and this could cost up to $40.\nHow Long Can You Have Money in a CD?\nCD terms often range from 3 months to 10 years, so you can have your money in a CD for generally any length of time in between. Some CDs have terms of 8 or 9 months, others have 15-month terms, and there are 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year, 6-year, 7-year, 8-year, and 10-year terms\u2014though the longer terms may be offered by fewer banks or credit unions.\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy a CD?\nPutting money into a CD right now may be a smart move if you're looking to earn a high interest rate on money you don't need. CD rates are over 5.00% for many terms right now, and locking up your money for six, 12, or even 24 months could help you in the long run if CD rates decline in the next year or two. CD rates are higher in 2024 than they have been in 20 years. So yes, now is a good time to buy a CD.\nWhat Is a Jumbo CD?\nA CD with a minimum deposit requirement of $100,000 or more is usually considered a jumbo CD. While the required minimum deposit is higher than traditional CDs, the interest rates on jumbos are not always higher. That means you could earn a higher interest rate by depositing $100,000 in a traditional CD instead of a jumbo CD. Just shop around to learn which CD is best for your money and situation.\nFinancial Products & Institutions We Reviewed\nWe researched and reviewed more than 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

CD Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. While some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. Savings account rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means interest rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nWhy You Can Trust Us\nInvestopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best kids and teen savings accounts since 2021. We started by identifying more than two dozen banks and credit unions that offer a nationally available youth savings account with an above-average interest rate. Beyond the rate, however, we also considered balance requirements, monthly fees, and more. Our unbiased research always aims to provide readers with the best options available, regardless of any affiliate or partner relationships we may have.\nHow Does a Savings Account for Kids Work?\nKids savings accounts are a type of custodial account where a custodian\u2014 a parent, guardian, or other family member\u2014manages the account on behalf of a minor child. Once the child reaches adulthood\u2014which varies by state but in most states is age 18\u2014they gain ownership of the account.\nAnyone can contribute to these accounts, but the custodian is responsible for managing the account. If an individual makes a contribution or gift to a custodial account, that gift is considered irrevocable, which means that money belongs to the child. In 2025, individuals can make annual gifts of up to $19,000 without being subject to the gift tax.\nThere are restrictions on what custodians can do with the money in these accounts. According to the laws that govern these accounts, the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA), the custodian must use the funds in these accounts for the benefit of the minor.\nAdditionally, you or your child may owe tax on the interest earned. This is known as the kiddie tax. The kiddie tax is applicable to children under the age of 18 or full-time students under the age of 24. If your child\u2019s unearned income, like interest and capital gains, is less than $1,350, it won\u2019t be taxed. However, if unearned income is between $1,350 and $2,700, that money will be taxed at your child\u2019s marginal tax rate. If unearned income exceeds $2,700, it\u2019ll be taxed at the custodian\u2019s marginal tax rate.\nNote that the kiddie tax rules may be a bit more complex if your child has earned income (i.e., they earn money from a part-time job or a summer internship).\nCommon Kids Savings Accounts Terms to Understand\n- Annual percentage yield (APY): The APY is the annual rate of return, accounting for compounding. For example, if a savings account offers a 5% APY on your $10,000 balance and is compounded annually, you\u2019d earn $500 after one year. Interest may be compounded daily, weekly, quarterly, or yearly. Note that some banks only offer a higher APY on balances up to a certain amount. Take a bank that offers a 3% APY on balances up to $1,000 and a 1% APY on balances exceeding that amount. That means if you deposited $2,500, you would earn a 3% APY on $1,000 and then a 1% APY on the remaining $1,500.\n- Minimum opening deposit: Some bank accounts require people to deposit a minimum amount of money to open a new account.\n- Monthly maintenance fee: To keep an account open, some financial institutions have required monthly fees.\nHow to Open a Savings Account for Kids\n- Compare different accounts: When you\u2019re shopping around for different accounts, consider the APY, the minimum opening deposit, and whether the account has any monthly maintenance fees. You\u2019ll also want to think about how much you plan to deposit, as some accounts may only offer a higher APY on balances up to a certain amount.\n- Gather documents and information: During the application process, parents will typically be required to provide certain information about their child such as their Security Number (SSN) and birthdate. Additionally, parents may be required to provide a valid form of ID like a driver\u2019s license or passport.\n- Apply: When you\u2019re ready, you may be able to apply either online or in person. Just make sure you have all the information you need on hand.\nAlternatives to Savings Accounts for Kids\nIf you want to help your child get a head start on saving, you don\u2019t just have to opt for a savings account. It\u2019s possible to earn a higher return and take advantage of special tax benefits with other types of accounts.\nKids Savings Accounts vs. Custodial Brokerage Accounts\nLike kids savings accounts, custodial brokerage accounts must be managed by an adult, like a parent, guardian, or other family member. Generally, these accounts work similarly to kids savings accounts\u2014capital gains may be subject to the kiddie tax and funds must be used for the benefit of the minor.\nYet a custodial brokerage account offers a wide variety of investment options\u2014such as individual stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and bonds.\nKids Savings Accounts vs. 529 Savings Plans\nIf you want to save specifically for your child\u2019s education, consider opening a 529 savings plan instead, as these accounts offer special tax advantages. When you use funds from your 529 savings plan for qualified educational expenses\u2014like books, fees, and college tuition\u2014you won\u2019t have to pay federal or state income tax on those distributions. Furthermore, in some states, contributions may be deductible from your state income tax.\nAnother important element of 529 savings plans is that the original owner of the account retains its ownership, so the account isn\u2019t transferred to the beneficiary once they become an adult.\nAdditionally, account owners get more flexibility with a 529 savings plan than with a custodial account.\nWith a 529 savings plan, you can change the beneficiary after the account is open. For example, if the original beneficiary doesn\u2019t go to college, the owner can name a new beneficiary who can use the funds for educational expenses. Plus, under new rules, some funds from 529 savings plans may be eligible to be rolled over into Roth IRAs.\nHow We Find the Best Kids Savings Account Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia\u2019s full-time research and compliance teams track the rate data of about 200 banks and credit unions that offer deposit accounts to customers nationwide, including youth savings accounts. To qualify for our lists, an institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and must offer its products in at least 40 states.\nWhile some credit unions allow you to donate to a specific charity or association in order to join the credit union (e.g., if you don't meet other eligibility criteria such as where you live or work), we exclude from our rankings any credit union whose donation requirement is $40 or more.\nOur list of the best kids and teen savings accounts is ranked by APY, and where there is a tie, we lead with the account that allows a larger balance to earn the high interest rate. If still a tie, we list institutions alphabetically.\nFederal Reserve. \"Open Market Operations.\"\nFederal Reserve. \"Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.\"\nIRS. \u201cIRS releases tax inflation adjustments for tax year 2025.\u201d\nIRS. \u201cPublication 590-A (2024), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\u201d"

CD rates are near historic highs, with the top 18-month CD rates ranging from 4.10% to 4.40% APY. To find you the best CD rates nationwide, we review CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday morning. We've been tracking 18-month CD rates since 2019, and the top CD rates in our rankings typically pay three to five times as much as the national average\u2014or even more. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 2, 2025.\nIn the News\nThe Federal Reserve held rates steady at its July 30 meeting, the fifth consecutive time it has done so. Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. A rate cut later this year, perhaps as early as September, is expected, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nBelow are the top CD and annuity rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research that are available to U.S. customers everywhere:\nCD terms of 15 to 20 months are eligible for our 18-month rankings.

If there is still a tie, we rank alphabetically by institution name.\nTip\nThe annual percentage yield (APY) is the interest rate earned on an investment in one year, including compounding interest. A higher APY is better as your return will be higher.\nDetailed information on these top-paying nationally available 18-month CDs is provided below, including specifics about minimum deposits and early withdrawal penalties. For credit union CDs, information is also provided on how to easily join the credit unions offering them.\nWhy You Can Trust Our Expert Recommendations for the Best 18-Month CD Rates\nInvestopedia collects thousands of CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking CD rates, we look at factors like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs.\nInvestopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2019. Back when we first started tracking 18-month CD rates, the top interest rate on an 18-month CD was 2.70% APY. By October 2023, the top 18-month CD rate was 6.00%\u2014over two times what it was four years earlier. While CD rates have fallen since then, they remain high in 2024.\nThe CDs we recommend must be available nationwide and these certificates typically pay three to five times as much as the national average\u2014or even more. To be eligible for our rankings, each CD's minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000 and must be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union (which covers up to $250,000 per depositor).\nOverview: Sallie Mae Bank is the online banking arm of the well-known student loan provider.

You can get a CD from a bank or credit union. An 18-month CD requires you to keep the funds untouched for about a year and a half. For our rankings, we consider 18-month CDs to be anything with a term of 15 to 20 months.\nIn exchange for giving up access to your funds, you'll generally be rewarded with a higher interest rate than the bank pays on savings and money market accounts.\nWhen opening a CD, deposit a lump sum of funds into the account at or above the minimum required deposit for that CD. The funds will sit in the account for about 18 months, earning interest along the way. When the CD hits its maturity date, you can withdraw the funds plus their earned interest from the account with no penalty.\nFast Fact\nWhen asked in March where they would be most likely to put an extra $10,000, 10% of Investopedia readers said they would choose CDs, above high-yield savings accounts and paying down debt, but trailing individual stocks, ETFs, and money market funds.\nPros and Cons of 18-Month CDs\nPros\nOffers a guaranteed rate for 18 months: No matter what happens with the Federal Reserve and interest rates, the bank cannot change the APY you secure when you sign your CD agreement and make your deposit.\nMay pay a higher APY than other terms: Shopping around is critical, as rates can vary widely across institutions and also across different CD lengths.\nPays reliable and predictable earnings:Because your CD rate is fixed and your term is known, you can calculate exactly how much your earnings will amount to once the CD matures.\nIs safe and virtually risk-free: CDs opened at an FDIC bank or NCUA credit union are federally insured, protecting up to $250,000 of your deposits in the unlikely event that the institution fails.\nCan deter the temptation to spend since funds are tied up:Withdrawing your funds before the CD matures will trigger an early withdrawal penalty, which may be enough to stop you from pulling the funds out for unplanned spending.\nCons\nIncurs a penalty if you withdraw early: Every bank and credit union specifies their policy on how they'll calculate your penalty if you don't keep your CD funds deposited until maturity. Typically, the penalty is a number of months' interest that you'll forfeit.\nAllows only one deposit amount: With most CDs, you get one chance to decide how much you want to invest in the certificate. Additional deposits are generally not allowed.\nIf rates fall, you may wish you'd opted for a longer term: Investing in a longer CD would have allowed you to retain a good rate for a longer period of time\nIf rates rise, you'll be locked at a lower rate until maturity: If you lock into an 18-month CD and then rates rise, you'll be stuck with your current rate until you can withdraw your funds.\nImportant\nThough consumers tend to think about CD terms in nice round numbers, be sure to consider odd-term CDs, such as 15-month, 18-month, or 21-month certificates. It's not uncommon for promotional rate CDs to have unusual durations, so don't limit yourself to only the conventional terms.\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a CD\nWhen choosing a CD, consider the following factors:\nYour goals: Both short-term financial goals and long-term financial goals are important.\nHow much money you can deposit: CDs have minimums, so if you only have $500 to deposit, you'll need to find a CD with that minimum balance requirement.\nHow long you can leave that money in the CD without touching it: This will help you determine the right term\u2014whether that's a 1-year CD or a 3-year CD.\nInterest rates offered for your term and minimum deposit: The higher the rate, the more you will earn on your deposit during the CD term.\nCD type: Is it a bump-up CD or a regular CD? This will ensure you're choosing one that meets your needs and goals.\nOnce you choose a CD, open the account, and deposit your money to start earning interest.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"The key to choosing the right CD is matching the term length to your needs,\" said Ryan Greiser, CFP, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"If you won\u2019t need access to the money for a year or more, consider locking in a higher rate with a longer-term CD.\"\n18-Month CD Penalties and Fees\nAlmost all CDs\u2014not just 18-month CDs\u2014come with an early withdrawal penalty. That means that if you decide to take your money out of the CD before the date the CD matures, you have to pay a fee. The fee is typically in the form of interest you earned, such as three or six months' worth of interest.\nFor example, let's say you deposited $1,000 in an 18-month CD with a 5.00% APY. The total interest you would earn by keeping it in the CD for 18 months is $75.93. If the CD comes with an early withdrawal penalty worth six months of interest, then you would have to pay $25.31 if you decided to take your money out early.\nOther than the early withdrawal penalty, CDs don't typically come with any other fees (though the banking institution may require some).\nHilarey Gould, Senior Editorial Director for Financial Products and Services at Investopedia\nWhen choosing an 18-month CD, be sure to review the early withdrawal penalty. If you think you might need to withdraw your money before the CD matures, look for a CD with a lower penalty so that you end up with the most money possible when you withdraw. If you are positive that you won't touch the money in the CD until maturity, you may feel comfortable opening a CD with a more expensive penalty.\nHow to Find the Best 18-Month CD Rates\nThis list includes the best 18-month CD rates, meaning that they are the highest 18-month CD rates nationwide. To find you the top 18-month CD rates, we look at hundreds of banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions every day and gather the CDs with the highest rates that are available nationwide, including CDs with terms of 15 to 20 months.\nWhen looking for an 18-month CD, consider the amount of money you want to deposit, the interest rate on the CD, and the early withdrawal penalty. For example, if a 20-month CD offers a 5.00% interest rate on a $25,000 deposit, but a 12-month withdrawal penalty, you may want to compare it with a 15-month CD with the same deposit but a six-month withdrawal penalty.\nThis comparison is important to think about because if you need that money back sooner than maturity, you need to know what amount of interest you'll lose by withdrawing early. With that in mind, you'll need to first compare your options based on your deposit amount, then look at the rate and early withdrawal penalty.\nNote\nCD rates are the same for everyone who applies to open a CD. Your credit score and other financial history and experience are not determining factors like they are with credit cards or loans. So even if you have bad credit, you can earn a high interest rate on your savings by locking it up in a CD for a period of time.\nHow to Open an 18-Month CD\nAfter you find the right CD for you, you'll need to apply to open the account. This may be easy if you're already a member of the bank or credit union. If you're not, you may need to open another savings account first, or apply to be a member of the credit union by joining another free or low-cost organization (the American Consumer Council is a popular one).\nTo open an 18-month CD, follow these steps:\nFind the CD you want to open, whether online or in-person at the bank or credit union.\nHave a current membership or relationship with the bank or credit union via an open account like a savings or a checking account, and/or through a non-profit organization (typically only applies to credit unions).\nFill out the application with your name, deposit amount, and other personal info.\nWait for approval.\nFund the CD and let your money earn interest. You may be able to send a check, wire the money, or electronically transfer it, depending on the institution.\nRead the CD's terms. This fine print info will tell you the interest rate you'll be paid, the date of the CD's maturity, how often your interest will be paid and compounded, and the early withdrawal penalty (if any) that you need to pay if you request to withdraw your money before maturity.\nOnce your 18-month CD is opened, it's a set-it-and-forget-it process to earn your interest.\nThere are just two times when you may need to take action on your 18-month CD:\nWhen you need your money back before maturity: You'll likely pay an early withdrawal penalty and will need to withdraw the funds before transferring them into another account. Then the CD will be closed.\nWhen your CD matures: You may need to indicate if you want the CD to roll over into another CD at the institution or if you want the money withdrawn and deposited back into your other account.\nInstead of an 18-month CD, you could choose a shorter certificate to limit the amount of time your funds are tied up, but you may have to settle for a slightly lower rate. The same is true if you go with a longer-term CD: rates could be lower than what you can earn in 18 months. It all depends on the current rate environment, so it's important that you shop around.\nFor example, if rates are higher now than you think they will be in the future, locking in one of today's rates for as long as possible can be a smart move. This allows you to retain your APY for longer than if you chose a shorter-term CD.\nCDs vs. Savings and Money Market Accounts\nOpening a top-paying high-yield savings account or a money market account is an alternative option to a CD. These accounts let you earn a competitive return on your funds with more flexibility. The downside is that savings and money market accounts pay a variable rate, which means that if interest rates go down in the future, so will the rate you're earning in these accounts.\nThe same applies to cash reserve and money market funds at brokerage firms. Many of these pay much lower rates than you can earn with a high-yield savings account at a top-paying bank. But even when the APY on a brokerage cash account is competitive, it too is a variable rate that you can't lock in like you can with a CD.\nCDs vs. US Savings Bonds & Treasuries\nYou could alternatively put your funds in U.S. savings bonds or Treasuries. The U.S. government offers two types of savings bonds: EE bonds and I bonds. EE bonds offer a fixed interest rate that you'll know at the time of making your deposit decision, while I bonds offer a rate that changes every six months based on current inflation levels (hence, the name I bonds). These investments are exceptionally safe, but they do not allow a withdrawal within the first 12 months for any reason.\nYou can also lend money to the U.S. government by purchasing Treasury bonds. These are called T-bills for durations of four weeks to one year, and Treasury notes for durations of two to 10 years. Treasuries are considered one of the safest investments in the world, but their rates are not always as high as the best CDs or high-yield savings accounts.\nCD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which the Federal Reserve lowered for the first time since 2020 at its September 2024 meeting, then again in both November and December. The rate had held steady at a range of 5.25%\u20135.50% since July 2023, but it now stands at 4.25%\u20134.50% and CD rates can be expected to follow suit.\nWith rates possibly headed lower yet this year, now is the time to lock in a higher CD rate while it is still possible. In July, the inflation rate was 2.7%, unchanged from June's 2.7% rate.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat Are the Best CD Rates for 18 Months?\nThe best CD rates for an 18-month term will have an APY of 4.15% or better. The best 18-month CD will come with a high rate, low early withdrawal penalty, and low minimum deposit required. Most of the top 18-month CDs have an early withdrawal penalty of three to six months and a minimum deposit of $500 or more.\nIs an 18-Month CD a Good Investment?\nRight now, an 18-month CD is a good investment because you can earn a high rate on an 18-month CD. Once you open that CD, you are guaranteed that rate until the CD matures (as long as you do not withdraw the money early). Considering the Fed is watching inflation and interest rates closely, there's a chance it could cut the fed funds rate in the next 18 months. That would mean that CD rates would also fall in the future. So locking in an 18-month CD now can help you get the highest rate possible before any rates fall.\nDo 18-Month CDs Beat Inflation?\nAn 18-month CD can help you hedge against high inflation because the rate you can earn may be more than the inflation rate. For example, in July 2025, the inflation rate was 2.7%. At that same time, top 18-month CD rates paid 4.45%. You can earn more on your savings with an 18-month CD to help combat the additional costs you'll incur, thanks to inflation.\nWhen Is an 18-Month CD a Good Choice?\nAn 18-month CD is a suitable option for money you won't need in the coming year or longer. For those with a specific plan for the money, such as a down payment on a house or paying college tuition bills for a child, an 18-month CD might provide just the time frame you need to keep funds safe and reliably earning interest.\nAnother appeal of 18-month CDs is to provide one rung of a shortened CD ladder. A CD ladder is a strategy for investing your funds in five CDs of differing terms rather than all at once. For a yearly ladder, you would own a 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year CD. But you can also create a shorter ladder, with six-month increments between the CDs (e.g., 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, etc.).\nAre Online Bank CDs Safe?\nMany of the highest deposit rates, whether for CDs, savings accounts, or money market accounts, are offered by online banks. Some of these are online-only banks, meaning they operate solely on the Internet, while others are brick-and-mortar banks with a separate online banking arm. Sometimes the online operations of physical banks even have an entirely different name and brand identity.\nThough you may feel nervous depositing your funds into an Internet bank instead of at a physical branch, online accounts and institutions are just as safe as their more traditional counterparts. That's because FDIC insurance doesn't discriminate\u2014the $250,000 in deposit insurance it provides consumers in case of bank failure applies equally to online and brick-and-mortar banks.\nWhy Do Shorter CDs Sometimes Pay More Than Longer CDs?\nShorter CDs sometimes pay more than longer CDs because the institution wants you to open an account with them. These shorter CDs may be promotional CDs with high rates but low terms. The lower the term, the less you'll earn on your money, even if it's a higher interest rate.\nAnother factor is that banks and credit unions decide their CD yields based on where they think the federal funds rate will be in the future. So when it's expected that future interest rates will be lower than today's rates, it's common to see short- or mid-term CDs paying the best rates.\nHow Do You Build a CD Ladder?\nA CD ladder enables you to access the higher rates typically offered on 5-year CDs, but with the twist that a portion of your money becomes available every year, rather than every five years. Here's how to do it.\nTake the amount of money you want to invest in CDs and divide it by five.\nPut one-fifth of the funds into a top-earning 1-year CD, another fifth into a top 2-year CD, another into a 3-year CD, and so forth through a 5-year CD. Let\u2019s say you have $25,000 available. That would give you five CDs of varying lengths, each with a value of $5,000.\nWhen the first CD matures in a year, you take the resulting funds and open a top-rate 5-year CD.\nOne year later, your initial 2-year CD will mature, and you'll invest those funds into another 5-year CD.\nContinue doing this every year with whichever CD is maturing until you end up with a portfolio of five CDs all earning 5-year APYs, but with one of them maturing every 12 months, keeping your money a bit more accessible than if all of it were locked up for a full five years.\nCan You Lose Money in a CD?\nYou can't lose your principal when you deposit it in a CD. But you can lose out on interest in the CD if you withdraw it early. Most CDs come with an early withdrawal penalty (but not all CDs have penalties) so if you take your money out of the account before the term is up, you may pay a price. CDs are federally insured though, so if you're worried about losing money in a CD due to a bank failure, you can rest assured that your money is backed by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000 per institution.\nFinancial Institutions We Reviewed\nWe researched and reviewed over 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

Best 18-Month CD Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

To find you the highest 3-month CD rates nationwide, we review CDs from hundreds of banks and credit unions every day. CD terms of 2\u20134 months are eligible for our 3-month rankings, with minimum deposit requirements of up to $25,000. In cases where more than one institution pays the same annual percentage yield, we've prioritized CDs by the shortest term, then the CD requiring a smaller minimum deposit, and if still a tie, alphabetically by institution name. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 2, 2025.\nIn the News\nThe Federal Reserve held rates steady at its July 30 meeting, the fifth consecutive time it has done so. Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. A rate cut later this year, perhaps as early as September, is expected, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nBelow are the top CD and annuity rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research that are available to U.S. customers everywhere:\nBest 3-Month CD Rates\nDow Credit Union \u2013 4.40% APY\nDR Bank \u2013 4.40% APY\nBrilliant Bank \u2013 4.35% APY*\nIvy Bank \u2013 4.35% APY\n=American Bank \u2013 4.25% APY\nBask Bank \u2013 4.25% APY\nMerchants Bank of Indiana \u2013 4.25% APY\nBanesco USA \u2013 4.25% APY\nWebBank \u2013 4.25% APY\nPopular Direct \u2013 4.30% APY\nDigital Federal Credit Union \u2013 4.25% APY\nFirst National Bank of America \u2013 4.20% APY\nMerrick Bank \u2013 4.20% APY\nVio Bank \u2013 4.20% APY\nCustomers Bank \u2013 4.15% APY\nDetails on these top-paying nationally available three-month CDs are provided below, including their minimum required deposits and early withdrawal penalties.

The individual agrees to deposit a sum of money and keep it at the institution for a predetermined number of months or years. In exchange, the bank or credit union agrees to pay the account holder a higher interest rate than if they put the funds into a simple savings account.\nA 3-month CD is therefore a certificate for which the maturity period or term is roughly 90 days. At most banks and credit unions, a 3-month term is the shortest certificate duration they offer, while some institutions don't offer any CDs shorter than six months.\nImportant\nBe sure to consider the interest rates of 3-month CDs in comparison to high-yield savings accounts. Though traditional savings accounts generally pay minimal interest, high-yield savings accounts can pay rates higher than those of a 3-month CD while not requiring you to give up access to your funds.\nPros and Cons of 3-Month CDs\nPros\nExtremely safe and predictable\nCan help deter spending temptations\nGives you options after just a short commitment\nMay pay a higher APY than a standard savings account\nCons\nWithdrawing early will trigger a penalty\nMay pay a lower APY than high-yield accounts that allow withdrawals\nIn a short time, you'll need to decide again about what to do with your funds\nPros Explained\nExtremely safe and predictable: CDs opened at FDIC banks and NCUA credit unions are federally insured, protecting up to $250,000 of your deposit in the unlikely event that the institution fails. In addition, since the CD's rate is fixed for the 3-month term, your earnings are completely predictable.\nCan help deter spending temptations: Putting money in a 3-month CD instead of just keeping it in a savings account can be a useful tool for blocking the temptation to spend your savings on an unplanned purchase.\nGives you optionsafter just a short commitment: You only have to wait three months before you can access your funds again and make a new choice with your money. Perhaps rates have climbed and now you can open another CD with a higher APY. Or maybe you want to use the cash now or keep it in a liquid savings account for a near-term expense.\nMay pay a higher APY than a standard savings account: You'll be able to earn more with a 3-month CD than by keeping money in your checking account, and you may be able to outearn your bank's savings account rate as well.\nCons Explained\nWithdrawing early will trigger a penalty: Anytime you cash in a CD before maturity, you'll be hit with an early withdrawal penalty. Each bank and credit union has a stated policy on how they calculate their penalty, with the most typical practice being a number of months of forfeited interest.\nMay pay a lower APY than high-yield accounts that allow withdrawals: Though longer-term CDs usually pay more than high-yield savings accounts, short 3-month CDs often do not. So if you can earn as much or more with a savings account, that may be a better option, as it keeps your money accessible.\nIn a short time, you'll need to decide again about what to do with your funds: With a 3-month CD, you go through the process of opening the CD and then, in just three months, have to decide all over again where to put your money.\nFast Fact\nWhen asked in March where they would be most likely to put an extra $10,000, 10% of Investopedia readers said they would choose CDs, above high-yield savings accounts and paying down debt, but trailing individual stocks, ETFs, and money market funds.\nInstead of locking up your funds in a 3-month CD, you could just hold them in a liquid savings or money market account. That way you can access the funds if you need them. Just be sure to shop around for a great high-yield rate that matches or beats what you can earn with a 3-month CD.\nAlso, be aware that the rates paid on savings and money market accounts are variable, meaning the bank can lower them anytime they want. A CD's rate, in contrast, is fixed for the full term, though in the case of a 3-month certificate, your return is not secured for very long.\nLonger-Term CDs\nInstead of a 3-month CD, you could stretch to a 6-month or 1-year certificate, or an even longer term, depending on how long you feel you can live without your funds. The advantage is that you can almost always find a better rate on slightly longer CDs, since the 3-month term is typically the worst-paying CD duration.\nTreasury Bills\nAnother short-term option you can consider instead of a 3-month CD is a U.S. Treasury bill. T-bills allow you to lend money to the U.S. government for a short, fixed amount of time. Considered one of the safest investments in the world, T-bills offer durations ranging from four weeks to one year.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat Are the Differences Between CD, Savings, and Money Market Accounts?\nSavings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are collectively called deposit accounts. All are intended as vehicles for holding cash savings at a bank or credit union. Savings accounts and money markets are more similar, while certificates of deposit are somewhat different.\nA savings account allows you to withdraw funds at your convenience. The same is true for deposits: You can deposit a lump sum all at once, automate savings deposits on a regular cycle, or sporadically add funds when you have them available.\nAn account that allows you to deposit and withdraw funds at will is called a liquid account. Money market accounts are another type of liquid account, with the main difference being that money market accounts traditionally include check-writing privileges.\nCertificates of deposit are quite a bit different. Because you must deposit a lump sum of funds at the outset and then not touch it until the term expires, they are the opposite of liquid accounts. But what you lose in access to the funds is traded for a higher interest rate, meaning you are compensated for giving up your at-will access.\nWho Benefits From a 3-Month CD the Most?\nTheoretically, certificates of deposit are a good vehicle for someone who wants to earn more interest by committing their funds for a short time. But in the case of 3-month CDs, the time period is so brief that the interest rate premium can be quite slight, or even nonexistent. In fact, you can often earn more with a high-yield savings account, which doesn't require you to tie up your funds.\nStill, some people may benefit from committing their savings to a CD instead of putting it in a liquid account. That's because making the funds inaccessible can be a benefit for savers who might otherwise be tempted to dip into their savings for an unplanned purchase.\nWhat Are the Typical Rates for a 3-Month CD?\nInterest rates vary widely across the thousands of banks and credit unions that offer 3-month CDs. And rates across all deposit accounts change based on the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate. So it pays to do your homework and shop around.\nThe FDIC national rate average for 3-month certificates is 1.54% APY. As you can see, our current ranking of the top-paying 3-month CDs far outperforms that average. It's not uncommon to earn three to five times as much\u2014and sometimes more\u2014than the national average when you shop for the best rates and are open to institutions with whom you may not already have a banking relationship.\nHow Do I Join One of the Credit Unions on the List?\nCredit unions differ from banks in that customers must be members of the credit union to open accounts there. Fortunately, joining a credit union is generally fairly easy to do, and it's often inexpensive or even free.\nFor the purposes of our nationwide rankings, all included credit unions must offer an avenue for any adult U.S. citizen to become a member regardless of where they live or work. Joining often involves making a small donation to an affiliated nonprofit organization\u2014sometimes donating as little as $5\u2014and keeping a small minimum balance in a member savings account (most typically $5). For some credit unions, joining incurs no fee or donation at all.\nFinancial Institutions We Review\nWe researched and reviewed more than 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

Whether you\u2019re building up savings in a bank account or moving funds out of higher-risk investments, it\u2019s worth asking: Is your cash working as hard as it could be? Various cash strategies have different yields, and choosing wisely can make a big difference in the size of your future balance.\nThe good news for savers is that today\u2019s options remain attractive. Returns are still being buoyed by the Federal Reserve's elevated benchmark rate\u2014and that supportive backdrop looks likely to last a bit longer. The Fed held interest rates steady for a fifth straight meeting last month, but the CME Group's FedWatch Tool now shows an 87% chance of a rate cut at the Sept. 16-17 meeting, with the odds rising to 94% for the Fed's late October meeting.\nThat means you may only have a short window left to take advantage of today's highest yields\u2014which range up to 5.00%\u2014since deposit rates at banks, credit unions, and brokerages tend to track the federal funds rate. Even before a cut is announced by the Fed, rates on savings accounts, money markets, and CDs could start drifting lower. That makes now an ideal time to let your cash earn as much interest as it can.\nHow Much You Could Earn Right Now on $5K, $10K, or $25K\nWith a lump-sum savings deposit of $10,000, $25,000, or even $50,000, you can earn hundreds of dollars in interest if you choose one of today\u2019s top rates. Whether you opt for a 4.00% cash management account, a top high-yield savings or money market account paying 5.00%, or something in between, here\u2019s what different balances could earn over the next six months.\n| Six Months of Earnings at Various APYs | |||\n|---|---|---|---|\n| APY | Earnings on $5K for 6 months | Earnings on $10K for 6 months | Earnings on $25K for 6 months |\n| 4.00% | $99 | $198 | $495 |\n| 4.25% | $105 | $210 | $526 |\n| 4.50% | $111 | $223 | $556 |\n| 4.75% | $117 | $235 | $587 |\n| 5.00% | $123 | $247 | $617 |\nImportant\nDon't forget that the rate you earn from a savings account, money market account, cash account, or money market fund can fluctuate\u2014and will almost certainly drop once the Fed begins cutting rates. In contrast, CDs and Treasurys allow you to lock in your return for a set term.\nRelated Stories\nThis Week\u2019s Highest-Paying Options for Savings, CDs, and Treasurys\nFor a low-risk return that\u2019s still rewarding, today\u2019s top cash investment options fall into three main categories:\n- Bank and credit union products: Savings accounts, money market accounts (MMAs), and certificates of deposit (CDs)\n- Brokerage and robo-advisor products: Money market funds and cash management accounts\n- U.S. Treasury products: T-bills, notes, and bonds, plus inflation-protected I bonds\nYou can choose a single option or mix and match based on your goals and timeline. Either way, it\u2019s essential to know what each one is currently paying. Below, we break down the top rates in each category as of Friday\u2019s market close, along with how they\u2019ve changed since last week.\nBank and Credit Union Rates\nThe rates below represent the top nationally available annual percentage yields (APYs) from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily analysis of more than 200 institutions offering products nationwide.\nBrokerage and Robo-Advisor Cash Rates\nThe yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed but can be adjusted at any time.\nU.S. Treasury Rates\nTreasury securities pay interest through maturity and can be purchased from TreasuryDirect or traded on the secondary market through a bank or brokerage. I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirect and can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months.\nThis Week\u2019s Best Cash Rates, All in One Place\nHere's a summary look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by today's highest rates. Note that the rates shown are the top qualifying rate for each product type.\nHow To Choose the Best Place for Your Cash\nBank and Credit Union Products\nSavings Accounts\nThe most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. You'll want to look for a high-yield savings account, and it pays to choose from those offering the very best rates in the country.\nFortunately, our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you 12 options that pay 4.40% or more\u2014and as much as 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time.\nMoney Market Accounts\nA money market account is a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is useful to you, compare the best money market accounts.\nIf you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type\u2014money market or savings\u2014pays the better rate. Today's top money market account rate is 5.00%\u2014currently matching the best high-yield savings rate. But again, money market rates are variable, just like savings account rates. That means they can be lowered at any time.\nCertificates of Deposit\nA certificate of deposit (CD) doesn't carry that risk. A CD is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate, promising a guaranteed return for a set period, generally ranging from three months to five years. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includes seven options paying at least 4.50%\u2014with a top rate of 4.60% APY.\nBut be aware that CDs are a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty.\nBrokerage and Robo-Advisor Products\nMoney Market Funds\nUnlike a money market account at a bank, money market funds are mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily, but they currently range from 3.96% to 4.21% at the three biggest brokerages.\nCash Management Accounts\nFor uninvested cash held at a brokerage or robo-advisor, you can have the funds \"swept\" into a cash management account where they will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts.\nU.S. Treasury Products\nTreasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds\nThe U.S. Treasury offers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from four to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of two to five years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- or 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.58% to 4.92%.\nYou can buy T-bills, notes, and bonds straight from TreasuryDirect or buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks. Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect\u2014the U.S. Treasury\u2019s online platform for buying federal government securities\u2014has no fees.\nYou can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which you can read about here.\nI Bonds\nU.S. Treasury I bonds have a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends. You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. While you own the bond, your rate will change every six months.\nI bond rates increased on May 1, from 3.11% for bonds issued during the previous six months to 3.98% for new bonds purchased from May 1 to Oct. 31, 2025. For holders of existing I bonds, your next six-month rate will also increase\u2014by almost a full percentage point. See our story about the recent rate change, including the rate tables for different bond dates.\nHow We Find the Best Savings and CD Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify a maximum deposit amount that's below $5,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we leave out credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- As you'd expect, Americans ages 35-44 have more saved than people younger than 35, but less than their older counterparts.\n- Your age, your financial situation, your goals, and other factors determine your ability to save.\n- Automating savings and taking advantage of work benefits can help boost your savings.\n- One of today\u2019s best high-yield savings accounts or a top nationwide CD can also help maximize your savings.\nThe full article continues below these offers from our partners.\nWhat the Average American Has Saved by Age 35-44 (and How You Stack Up)\nIf you\u2019re in your 30s or 40s, you may have a variety of things competing for your time and money: a family, higher living expenses, student loans, a mortgage, college tuition\u2014or perhaps some bigger-ticket purchases on the horizon, such as a wedding or a new home.\nWhatever your circumstances, they impact your ability to save money for the future. Age is one determining factor, and it\u2019s not surprising that the older you are, the more you\u2019re likely to have saved. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest Survey of Consumer Finances, the median balance that households with bank accounts had in 2022 (the most recent data available) ranged from $5,400 for those under 35 to $13,400 for those ages 65-74.\nAmericans in the 35-44 age group fell in the middle. Among the 98.4% of people in that age group who have a bank account, the median balance was $7,500.\n| Median Bank Account Balances by Age Among Bank Account Holders | ||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Under 35 | 35-44 | 45-54 | 55-64 | 65-74 | 75 or older | |\n| 2013 | $2,800 | $4,840 | $5,090 | $6,360 | $8,910 | $8,910 |\n| 2016 | $3,150 | $4,690 | $5,010 | $6,620 | $9,870 | $12,330 |\n| 2019 | $3,760 | $5,460 | $7,420 | $6,520 | $9,270 | $10,780 |\n| 2022 | $5,400 | $7,500 | $8,700 | $8,000 | $13,400 | $10,000 |\nImportant\nWe use median figures here, instead of mean averages, to reduce the impact of those with exceptionally high or low savings amounts. The median value is that of an American in the middle of the range\u2013where half of the survey respondents reported more savings and half reported less.\nRelated Stories\nIn addition to what\u2019s in bank accounts, people 35-44 have money stashed in other kinds of accounts and assets, with 61% having retirement accounts.\n| Where Else People Age 35-44 Are Saving Money | ||\n|---|---|---|\n| Asset | % Households with Asset | Median Value for Asset Holders |\n| Savings Bonds | 6.5% | $750 |\n| CDs | 4.4% | $10,000 |\n| Stocks (directly held) | 20.6% | $12,000 |\n| Retirement Accts | 61.5% | $45,000 |\n| Bonds (directly held) | 0.4% | $45,000 |\n\"Directly held\" stocks and bonds are not in a retirement account. The value of bonds in this table is high, given that only a tiny fraction of people in this age group own directly held corporate or municipal bonds. This small group either holds numerous bonds, bonds with high values, or both. Also, survey respondents self-report values, and could be reporting face values of bonds that they find on account statements, rather than lower market values.\nHow to Set\u2014and Meet\u2014Savings Goals by Age 45\nIs there a perfect amount to save?\n\u201cBy your mid-30s to early 40s, I typically suggest having at least 1.5 to 2 times your annual income saved, including retirement accounts, cash savings, and investments,\u201d said Paul Miller, a CPA and managing partner at Miller & Company, LLP in Queens, New York.\nMiller offers some savings tips:\n- Track your spending and make a budget: Knowing what you\u2019re spending helps you find areas to cut back if possible. \u201cEven small changes like eating out less or cancelling unused subscriptions can free up extra money to save,\u201d Miller said.\n- Automate savings: Even if it\u2019s for a small weekly amount, set up automatic transfers. These savings add up over time without much thought.\n- Set up micro-saving: Use bank apps or programs that round up purchases and put the spare change in your savings account. This can be a good tactic for those with tighter incomes, Miller said.\n- Use work benefits: If your employer offers a 401(k) match or savings plan, aim to contribute enough so you can get the full matching funds. It\u2019s free money that will boost your savings.\nIn addition to what you have saved, where you have that money saved is also important, Miller said. You\u2019ll pay taxes when you withdraw money in a 401(k) or traditional IRA, while funds in a Roth IRA will be tax-free down the road. \u201cThe goal is to not only save enough, but to diversify how it\u2019s taxed, so you have flexibility down the line,\u201d he said.\nHow to Boost Your Savings Balances With Today's High Interest Rates\nHigh-yield savings accounts and CDs are two options that can help put more money in your pocket.\nFor money you need full access to, consider a high-yield savings account. A dozen of the highest-paying savings accounts currently pay between 4.40% and 5.00% APY. The rates are variable, meaning the bank or credit union can change them at any time.\nAn additional strategy is to commit a portion of your savings to a certificate of deposit. CDs pay a fixed and guaranteed rate. In exchange, you need to leave your money in the CD for a set time period, usually between 3 months and 5 years. The top-paying CDs are offering historically high yields right now\u2014as high as 4.60%\u2014and those are locked in regardless of what happens with interest rates over time. So if you can allocate a portion of your savings to go untouched for a while, a CD can further boost your earnings.\nDaily Rankings of the Best CDs and Savings Accounts\nWe update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available:\nImportant\nNote that the \"top rates\" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher.\nHow We Find the Best Savings and CD Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify a maximum deposit amount that's below $5,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

      "text": "What Is the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)?\nThe term Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) refers to a law that allows a minor to receive gifts without the aid of a guardian or trustee. Gifts can include money, patents, royalties, real estate, and fine art.\nA UTMA account allows the gift giver or an appointed custodian to manage the minor\u2019s account until the latter is of age. It also shields the minor from tax consequences on the gifts, up to a specified value.\nKey Takeaways\n- The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) allows a minor to receive gifts without the aid of a guardian or trustee.\n- The law is an extension of the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.\n- The minor named in the UTMA can avoid tax consequences until they attain legal age for the state in which the account is set up.\n- The donor can name a custodian, who has the fiduciary duty to manage and invest the property on behalf of the minor until they become of legal age.\n- It is up to individual states to adopt or amend the UTMA for its residents.\nUnderstanding the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)\nThe UTMA is similar to the original version of the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA). It allows minors to receive gifts and avoid tax consequences until they become of legal age in the state in which they live\u2014typically 18 or 21 years of age. The UTMA incorporates the language of the UGMA and extends the original definition of gifts beyond cash and securities to include real estate, paintings, royalties, and patents.\nThe UTMA provides a convenient way for children to save and invest without carrying the tax burden. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows for an exclusion from the gift tax of up to $18,000 per person for 2024, a $1,000 increase from the previous year, for a qualifying gift, including gifts to minors.\nThe minor\u2019s Social Security number (SSN) is used for tax reporting purposes on UTMA accounts. Because assets held in a UTMA account are owned by the minor, this may have a negative impact when the minor applies for financial aid or scholarships.\nEach state has the option to adopt or amend the UTMA for its residents. For example, South Carolina has not adopted the UTMA for its citizens, and Florida passed a statute in 2015 that allows any property to be held by the UTMA custodian until the minor is 25, if desired.\nImportant\nAny earnings that are generated within a UTMA are taxed at the kiddie tax rate by the IRS up to the allotted threshold of $2,500. Earnings after that are taxed at the adult donor\u2019s marginal tax rate.\nSpecial Considerations\nThe UTMA allows the donor to name a custodian, who has the fiduciary duty to manage and invest the property on behalf of the minor until that minor becomes of legal age. The property belongs to the minor from the time the property is gifted. If the donor dies while serving as custodian, the value of the custodianship property is included in the donor\u2019s estate.\nWarning\nThe assets in a UTMA are counted as part of the donor\u2019s taxable estate until the minor takes possession.\nUniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) vs. Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)\nAs noted above, the UTMA is similar to an earlier version of the UGMA. In fact, it is an extension of the UGMA. The UGMA was developed in 1956 and revised in 1966. It is limited to the transfer of cash or securities. The UTMA was finalized in 1986. Both laws were approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and adopted by most of the 50 states, but each state can modify its statute.\nThe UGMA and UTMA provide a way to transfer property to a minor without the need for a formal trust. They allow assets to be managed by a custodian who is appointed by the donor. The assets are then turned over to the minor when they become of legal age in the state where the gift was made.\nThe primary difference between the UGMA and the UTMA is in the assets that are allowed in these accounts. UGMAs are limited to cash and securities, but many types of property can be transferred to minors in the UTMA, including:\n- Cash\n- Stocks and bonds\n- Patents\n- Royalties\n- Real estate\n- Fine art\n- Mutual funds and other investments\n- Intellectual property\nContributions to a UGMA or UTMA are made using after-tax dollars, which means donors don\u2019t receive a tax deduction for making them. Just like a UTMA, gifts made to a UGMA are tax free up to $18,000 per person for 2024 and $19,000 per person for 2025.\nCan a Minor Receive Gifts or Assets without a Guardian or Trustee?\nYes, a minor can receive gifts or assets without a guardian or trustee as it is stipulated in the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. The UTMA is a law that governs the transfer of assets from adults to minors. it provides parents and other adults with a tax-advantaged way to pass on gifts to minors without needing to create a formal trust. In doing so, the adult who donates the gift would typically act as the custodian for those assets until the minor reaches legal age. Alternatively, the donor can also appoint a third party to serve as the custodian of those assets.\nWhat Is the Difference Between the UTMA and the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)?\nThe UTMA and the UGMA serve similar purposes, but there are important differences between them. Most notably, the UTMA allows for a broader range of assets to be gifted, including patents, royalties, real estate, and art.\nThe UTMA also provides additional time for the assets being gifted to reach their maturity dates, such as in the case of a bond. By contrast, the UGMA requires the assets to be assumed by the minor once the minor reaches 18 years of age.\nWhat Are the Pros and Cons of Using a UTMA Account?\nThe main advantage of using a UTMA account is that the money contributed to the account is exempted from paying a gift tax of up to a maximum of $18,000 per year for 2024 and $19,000 per year for 2025. Any income earned on the contributed funds is taxed at the tax rate of the minor who is being gifted the funds. Since the minor\u2019s income is presumably significantly lower than that of the adult donor, this can lead to significant tax savings.\nOne of the drawbacks of using a UTMA account, however, is that it can make the recipient less eligible for need-based college scholarship programs and other such initiatives.\nWhen Can a Child Claim Ownership of an UTMA Account?\nDepending on the state, a UTMA account is handed over to a child when they reach either age 18 or age 21. In some jurisdictions, at age 18 a UTMA account can only be handed over with the custodian\u2019s permission, and at 21 is transferred automatically. Inquire with the bank or brokerage where the UTMA is housed for clarification.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) is a law designed to allow a minor to receive gifts, including money, patents, royalties, real estate, fine art, securities, and more, without the aid of a guardian or trustee. It is similar to an earlier law, the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA), which was limited to gifts of cash and securities.\nUTMA accounts are often set up to help fund a child\u2019s education, although it\u2019s important to keep in mind that having a UTMA may impact a child\u2019s qualification for financial aid or scholarships. A 529 plan may be a better choice for a child headed to college."

Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. A rate cut later this year, perhaps as early as September, is expected, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Money market account rates closely follow the Fed funds rate, which means money market account rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nWhat Is a Money Market Account?\nA money market account is a type of bank account that pays a better interest rate than what you can earn on the money in your checking account (which typically pays no interest) or in a regular savings account. That makes it a great place to move some of the funds you don't need every day, boosting the amount of interest you earn over the course of each month.\nMoney market accounts are smart for anyone who wants to earn a high-yield interest rate but also wants check-writing privileges. Though you may not be able to find a money market APY quite as high as the best savings account, you can often get close, while adding an additional way to withdraw your funds.\nInterest rates on money markets are variable and can change over time. They are not fixed like with a CD. They are more like a savings or checking account where the rate is variable and the account is liquid. That means you can deposit and withdraw funds more or less as you choose. But unlike a savings account, money market accounts give you the option to write checks, making them a sort of hybrid between savings and checking accounts.\nWarning\nDon't assume that because an account has the words \"money market\" in its name that it is a true money market account with check-writing privileges. In recent years, financial institutions have started to use the phrase \"money market\" as a marketing term, sometimes applied to accounts with no check-writing abilities and therefore they are essentially high-yield savings accounts.\nPros and Cons of Money Market Accounts\nPros\nYour balance earns interest\nWithdraw and deposit when you like\nOffers virtually risk-free safety\nIf rates rise, your APY could increase\nCons\nScoring a high APY may require opening an account at another bank\nEasy access to your money can make it tempting to spend\nIf rates drop, your APY could be lowered\nPros Explained\nYour balanceearns interest: Unlike a typical checking account, your balance in a money market will earn an annual percentage yield (APY), usually paid to you at the end of each monthly statement cycle.\nAllows withdrawals and deposits when you like: You can deposit money into a money market account at any time, and you can generally withdraw it when you like. Some accounts limit your withdrawals to six per month, but many accounts no longer have this restriction.\nOffers virtually risk-free safety: You cannot lose money on a money market account, and if you open it at an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union, your deposits are federally insured in the unlikely scenario that the institution fails.\nIf rates rise, your APY could increase: Like a savings account, money market accounts pay a variable rate, which means the APY may rise when interest rates are on an upswing.\nCons Explained\nScoring a high yield may require opening an account at another bank: To earn the best rate on a money market account, you'll need to shop around. Odds are high that scoring a top rate will require opening a money market account at a bank different than where you already have a checking and savings account.\nEasy access to your money can make it tempting to spend it: Because you can withdraw funds from a money market, there is little to stop the temptation of pulling out money and spending it.\nIf rates drop, your APY could be lowered: When interest rates drop, the rate on your money market account is likely to be reduced.\nExpert Take\n\"Though there\u2019s no way to know how much the Fed will ultimately lower rates\u2014or how long they\u2019ll keep cutting\u2014we\u2019re likely to see at least one more rate reduction this year, and then more cuts next year. That could lower the Fed rate a full percentage point or two, which would push rates on money market accounts down by a roughly similar amount.\" ~Sabrina Karl, Investopedia Staff Writer\nHow Much Can You Earn in a Money Market Account?\nA money market account pays interest, just like a savings account. Money market accounts tend to pay higher rates than traditional savings accounts; their rates are on par with high-yield savings account rates. Here's an example of how much you could make in a money market account compared to a traditional savings account if you were to deposit $1,000 and then contribute $250 per month for one year:\nAccount Type\nAPY\nDeposit\nMonthly Contributions\nEarnings After 1 Year\nInterest Earned\nTraditional Savings\n0.01%\n$1,000\n$250\n$4,000.24\n24 cents\nMoney Market Account\n4.50%\n$1,000\n$250\n$4,111.77\n$111.77\nYou could earn $111.53 more in interest in a money market account compared to a traditional savings account.\nKey Terms to Know About Money Market Accounts\nMoney markets are very similar to savings accounts. There are a few key terms you'll see and hear when looking into opening a money market account:\nOpening minimum deposit: This is the amount you will need to put into the account immediately upon opening in order to qualify for the APY and interest rate.\nAPY: This is the annual percentage yield, or the rate you can earn if you keep the account open and in good standing for one full year. APY includes compounding.\nInterest rate: This rate may be a little lower than the APY because it does not include compounding.\nOngoing balance: This is the required amount you need to maintain in the money market account every month in order to earn the APY.\nCheck-writing: This is the ability to write a physical check, drawing funds from your money market account. This is the main difference between a savings account and a money market account.\nMaximum withdrawals: This is the limit on how many times you can withdraw money from your money market account per month. The limit will differ by bank or credit union.\nHow to Choose the Best Money Market Account for You\nThe best money market account for you will be one that pays a competitive interest rate and has account requirements that will work for you. Some of the account features you'll want to consider are:\nAn opening deposit minimum\nAn ongoing balance requirement\nAny monthly maintenance fees\nThe number of withdrawals you'll be allowed to make per month\nWhether an ATM card is provided and can be used for cash withdrawals\nTo determine which of the factors above are the most important to you, think about how you expect to use the account, such as the minimum balance you feel confident you can maintain and how often you'll want to take funds out of the account.\nTip\nIf you've never opened an account somewhere other than your primary bank or credit union, you may worry that top-paying small institutions or online-only banks are riskier, or that it will be inconvenient. Fortunately, your funds are as protected as they are at any federally insured institution, regardless of size or whether it has branches. And though transferring funds between institutions can take one to three days, today's online banking systems make transfers very easy.\nHow to Open a Money Market Account\nOnce you've decided which money market account is best for you, opening the account should be pretty straightforward and will follow the same process as opening a savings or checking account.\nStart the online account opening process: Most institutions allow online account opening, so look for an \"Open Account\" button or a link on the institution's website.\nProvide personal information: Fill in all of the information asked of you on the online application. Note that you'll be asked security questions to confirm your identity.\nUpload required documents: The process varies from institution to institution, but most will ask you to provide a copy of identification, such as a photo or scan of your driver's license. Some banks will ask for this within the online account opening process, while others may ask you to upload it or send it via secure message after you've submitted your application.\nFund the account: Adding money your account may need to take place at the same time as you open the account, or may be able to be done later. If the money market account has a required opening deposit, you'll be asked toward the end of the application process how you'll fund your account. The most common way is via an ACH transfer from another bank, but other methods include a wire from another bank, sending in a paper check, or sometimes even charging a credit or debit card.\nRegister for online banking: Once you've completed the account application, some banks will make online banking immediately available to you. But others may require some time to fully approve your application, providing the info you need for online banking within a few days of your completion of the application.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"Before opening a money market account, make sure it fits your financial game plan,\" said Ryan Greiser, CFP, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"Money market accounts are great options when you want easy access to your cash, but there are a few factors you need to weigh.\"\n\"Look at the APY,\" Greiser said. \"While it\u2019s tempting to chase the highest rate, make sure you understand the account\u2019s terms\u2014minimum balance requirements, withdrawal limits, and potential fees can erode your gains. Fees and restrictions vary by institution, so you want to be sure the account isn\u2019t costing you more than it\u2019s earning.\"\nAlternatives to Money Market Accounts\nHere are a few additional options to consider instead of, or in addition to, putting funds in a money market account.\nMMA vs. Traditional Savings Account\nMoney market accounts tend to pay a higher return than traditional savings accounts. A money market account may require a larger initial deposit or ongoing balance\u2014or both\u2014than a standard savings account, but not always, so shop around. Money market accounts will also allow you to write checks, which traditional savings accounts do not offer.\nMMA vs. High-Yield Savings Account\nHigh-yield savings accounts and money market accounts are fairly interchangeable, with the only specific difference being that money market accounts offer check-writing. If you don't care so much about writing paper checks, then it's smart to shop the best high-yield savings accounts, as they often pay higher APYs.\nMMA vs. Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nIf you know you can live without a portion of your savings for months or years, you can often earn more by opening a certificate of deposit (CD). That's because banks and credit unions typically offer a higher APY on CDs in exchange for your agreement that you'll keep the funds in the CD until it matures. Another advantage of CDs is that their rate is fixed. If interest rates drop in the future, your money market rate will drop as well, but a CD rate is locked for the full CD term. Note that early withdrawals from a CD will trigger a penalty, but for some, this is a useful tool for thwarting the temptation to spend your savings.\nMMA vs. U.S. Savings Bonds\nSeries EE bonds offer a fixed interest rate that you'll know at the time of making your deposit decision, while I bonds offer a rate that changes every six months based on current inflation levels (hence, the name I bonds). These investments are exceptionally safe, but note that they do not, for any reason, allow a withdrawal within the first 12 months.\nMMA vs. U.S. Treasuries\nT-bills allow you to lend money to the U.S. government for a short, fixed amount of time. Considered one of the safest investments in the world, T-bills offer durations ranging from four weeks to one year.\nWhy You Should Trust Us\nInvestopedia has been researching bank deposit rates from over 200 nationwide banks and credit unions every weekday since 2019. We have been publishing our ranking of the best money market accounts since 2021. When ranking money market accounts, we ensure the institutions meet our requirement of being federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA, and we research the basic account features, such as minimum required balances, any fees, and other factors that will help readers choose the account that will best meet their needs. Launched in 1999, Investopedia has been helping readers find the best savings account and CD rates since 2019, and the best money market accounts since 2021.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho Has the Best Money Market Account Right Now?\nThe best money market accounts currently offer over 4.00% APY, although they're liable to change at any time. Every business day, Investopedia updates the list above to show the top MMA rates from nationally available banks and credit unions. You can check this list anytime to see the best money market account rates currently available.\nHow Much Will $50,000 Make in a Money Market Account? What About $100,000?\nYour earnings from a money market account depend on the average daily balance you hold in the account and the exact APY your account is paying. But we can make an estimate of what you'd earn if we assume an interest rate of 5.00% APY. On a $50,000 balance held in the account for one year, your earnings would be approximately $500, or roughly $41 per month. If you're lucky enough to have a $100,000 balance in the account, your earnings would be about $5,000 for the year, or about $416 per month.\nIs It Better to Put Money in a CD or Money Market Account?\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) and money market accounts each have their pros and cons\u2014neither is inherently better. CDs provide a fixed interest rate for a set duration, so they're a great way to lock in a high APY for a long time. But if you withdraw the money before maturity you'll pay a strict withdrawal penalty. They're an especially good choice if you won't need to access your money for a while, and they're a good option if rates are expected to fall. MMAs have variable rates, which can be changed anytime, but they allow you to withdraw your money with no penalty. So, they're a better choice if you'll need access to your savings.\nDo You Pay Taxes on Money in a Money Market Account?\nYou don't pay taxes on the money you deposit into a money market account, but instead, on the interest you earn. Interest earned in money market accounts, savings accounts, CDs, and high-yield checking and savings accounts is subject to taxes when it's a total of $10 or more.\nAre Money Market Accounts Safe? Are They FDIC Insured?\nMoney market accounts are exceptionally safe. First, every money market account on our list is federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), with coverage up to $250,000 per depositor and per institution. FDIC and NCUA insurance works exactly the same regardless of the size of the institution. So banking with a bigger or smaller bank does not change your risk for deposits up to $250,000.\nSecond, even if your money market account is offered by an online bank, you'll have federal protection there, too. If the bank is simply an online division of an existing brick-and-mortar bank that's FDIC-insured, then the online division is also protected. And even if the bank is internet-only, it likely is an FDIC member as well.\nThird, money market accounts are not investment accounts. They are deposit accounts. So the money you put in always belongs to you and cannot lose value, aside from any banking fees or drops in interest rates you may encounter.\nWhat Is the Downside of a Money Market Account?\nThe biggest drawback to putting your savings in a money market account is that the rate is not guaranteed. What you earn will be at the mercy of general interest rate fluctuations, so your money market rate can be expected to fall once the Federal Reserve starts lowering the federal funds rate. In contrast, money put in a CD will earn a fixed and guaranteed rate until the end of the certificate's term.\nSome money market accounts put a limit on the number of withdrawals you can make. If you choose one of these accounts with restrictions, a downside could be that you're not able to withdraw funds as freely each month as you may like.\nWhat Will Happen to Money Market Rates in 2025?\nMoney market account rates are variable and can change over time. Like with savings and CDs, they are influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. When the fed funds rate is high, money market accounts are more likely to be high. When the fed cuts rates, they are likely to decline. With the Fed expected to make rate cuts in 2025 now that inflation has slowed, money market account rates will be lower in 2025 than they were in 2023 and 2024.\nBanks We Reviewed\nWe regularly review the rates of the following FDIC banks and NCUA credit unions: 5Star Bank, All America Bank, Ally Bank, Amalgamated Bank, American Heritage Credit Union, BankUnited, Bellco Credit Union, Bethpage Federal Credit Union, BluPeak Credit Union, Brilliant Bank, Chevron Federal Credit Union, CIT Bank, ConnectOne Bank, Connexus Credit Union, Dept of Commerce Federal Credit Union, Digital Federal Credit Union, Discover Bank , EverBank, Finworth, First Capital Bank, First Foundation Bank, First Internet Bank, Forbright Bank, Genisys Credit Union, Hanscom Federal Credit Union, Hughes Federal Credit Union, Ideal Credit Union, KS StateBank, Latino Federal Credit Union, Luana Savings Bank, Merchants Bank of Indiana, Mountain America Credit Union, MutualOne Bank, My eBanc, MYSB Direct, Nationwide by Axos, nbkc bank, Northern Bank Direct, Northpointe Bank, Pen Air Credit Union, PenFed Credit Union, Presidential Bank, Prime Alliance Bank, Princeton Federal Credit Union, PSECredit Union, Quontic Bank, Redneck Bank, Republic Bank of Chicago, Sallie Mae Bank, Seattle Bank, Self-Help Federal Credit Union, Spectrum Federal Credit Union, Summit Credit Union, Synchrony Bank, TAB Bank, The Federal Savings Bank, UFB Direct, U.S. Bank, USAlliance Financial, Utah First Federal Credit Union, Webster Bank, and Zeal Credit Union.\nHow We Find the Best Money Market Account Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia researchers and fact-checkers track the rate data of more than 60 banks and credit unions that offer money market accounts to customers nationwide, resulting in a daily ranking of the top-paying money market accounts. To qualify for our list, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. The account also must allow check-writing.\nBanks and credit unions must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.\nInvestopedia was founded in 1999, and our coverage of the best money market accounts began in 2019. For more about how we choose the best money market accounts, read our full methodology.\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "text": "We make it easy to find top savings rates by giving you daily rankings of the best rates for savings accounts, money market accounts (MMAs), and certificates of deposit (CDs). And because we list the best-paying accounts based simply on APY, not on which financial institutions advertise with us, you can feel confident you\u2019re seeing a list of the truly best options available.\nWe have been researching and publishing the best rates for CDs, savings accounts, and MMAs since 2019. We carefully evaluate the financial institutions and accounts we include in our lists, and they must meet threshold criteria in order to qualify. This guide explains those criteria and how our ranking process works.\nHow We Find the Best Rates\nOur universe of nationally available banks and credit unions includes about 200 physical and online institutions. About 200 of these offer CDs that meet our criteria, 100 offer what we call high-yield savings accounts, and 60 provide money market accounts.\nOur team tracks the deposit rates at these institutions every business day, through a combination of automated and human processes, to ensure we find every great rate and update any out-of-date rates. We also regularly add institutions as they expand their availability or we learn of new nationwide players.\nMost institutions update their rates online in the morning hours across multiple time zones, and our process for collecting any new rates data takes place throughout the day. We update our lists every business day, and the \"updated\" date on the page will tell you if the page has been updated for the day.\nTip\nSee which rates met our criteria with our picks for the best CDs, best high-yield savings accounts, and best money market accounts.\nEligibility for Inclusion\nInstitutions That Qualify\nTo be eligible for inclusion in our deposit account rankings, financial institutions need to meet two primary criteria. They must be:\n- Federally insured\n- Available nationwide\nFederally Insured\nFor banks, this means they are a member of the FDIC and for credit unions, a member of the NCUA. This ensures that every customer\u2019s deposits up to $250,000 (per person, per institution, and per ownership category\u2014e.g., single account or joint account) are protected by the U.S. government should the institution fail or be seized. By only including FDIC and NCUA members in our rankings, you can rest assured that funds (up to $250,000) deposited with these institutions will be safe.\nAlong these lines, note that this means both brick-and-mortar and online banks are eligible for inclusion. If an online bank has FDIC insurance, deposits are just as safe there as at any other FDIC institution, regardless of whether the bank operates any physical branches.\nAvailable Nationwide\nTo best serve our readers nationwide, we only include banks and credit unions that accept customers from across the country. This generally means that online account opening is available and residency in any U.S. state is acceptable.\nWe do make a few exceptions for banks that serve most but not all of the country; our threshold for being considered a nationwide bank is that it must serve customers from at least 40 states. The vast majority of the banks in our rankings do indeed serve all 50 states, but when that\u2019s not the case, we indicate the exclusions with an asterisk.\nCredit unions operate a bit differently in that they require membership. Eligibility for joining, called the \u201cfield of membership,\u201d is often based on living in a particular geographic region or working for a certain employer.\nBut many credit unions open their doors to customers nationwide with a special pathway for those who don\u2019t otherwise meet the requirements. Sometimes this is free and other times it requires a one-time donation or membership fee to the credit union\u2019s nonprofit affiliate. In all of our articles on the best CDs, savings accounts, and money market accounts, we explain what is required to gain membership to the credit unions we include, while excluding any whose required donation is $40 or more.\nSavings Accounts and Money Market Accounts That Qualify\nFor our rankings of high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts, we include those whose minimum balance to earn the high rate is no more than $25,000.\nIn addition, we distinguish between savings accounts and money market accounts on the basis of check-writing privileges. Historically, money market accounts have allowed check writing and savings accounts have not, and we follow that traditional definition in our methodology.\nNote, however, that \u201cmoney market\u201d has evolved to be used as a marketing term, with some banks including it in the name of their savings account even when it does not include check writing. For our purposes, if the account does not permit check writing, it is eligible for our savings account rankings. If it does allow checks, it can be in our money market account rankings.\nLastly, for any savings or money market account that is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.\nCertificates of Deposit That Qualify\nCertificates of deposit can be considered for our standard CD rankings if they require a minimum initial deposit of no more than $25,000. Those with a required deposit of $50,000 to $100,000 qualify for our jumbo CD rankings. Though some CDs exist in the marketplace for balances of at least $250,000, the offerings are limited and we do not track nor rank these oft-called \u201csuper jumbo\u201d certificates.\nNote\nWe also exclude CDs from our definition of jumbo CDs that have a rate that\u2019s not higher than what you could get from that institution for a deposit of less than $50,000. These are not really jumbo CDs, but rather, standard CDs marketed as jumbos.\nTo qualify for our rankings, CDs must also have a fixed rate that is known for the duration of the term. For this reason, certificates that are indexed, sometimes called \u201cflex CDs\u201d or \u201cvariable-rate CDs,\u201d do not qualify, as their rate will fluctuate up or down with some unpredictable indicator, such as the prime rate or federal funds rate.\nOne exception is \u201cbump-up\u201d certificates that offer you the option to raise your rate during the term, usually just once and at your initiation. Since you are still guaranteed the original rate if you would like it for the full term, and since exercising the raised rate option would only improve your return, we do allow these certificates in our CD rankings.\nFactors That Disqualify CDs, Savings Accounts, and MMAs\nWe disqualify accounts that cap their advertised rate to only low balances, defined for our purposes as less than $5,000. For example, a savings account that advertises a high APY but applies it only to the first $1,000 of your balance would not qualify for our rankings. The same goes for special promotional CDs that offer a high rate but only on a deposit amount that's less than $5,000.\nFor savings and money market accounts, money must also be fee-free to withdraw or transfer to an external account. Exceptions, however, include standard fees, such as those associated with out-of-market ATMs or ordering a wire transfer.\nOn Apr. 17, 2025, Investopedia changed its methodology to broaden which savings accounts qualify for our rankings\u2014giving readers more choices for earning a top return. Previously, any requirement to make regular deposits to the account (including direct deposit) or a requirement to open another account at the institution (e.g., an accompanying checking account) would have disqualified a savings account from our rankings. Those extra requirements are now acceptable, and are noted in the information we present about each account so that readers can still make an informed choice.\nHow We Create Our Rankings\nRanking Order for Savings and Money Market Accounts\nAmong all the nationwide high-yield savings accounts or money market accounts that qualify for our lists, we rank them in order of interest rate, with those paying the highest APY topping the list. When two accounts pay the same rate, our next sorting criteria is the ongoing balance required to earn the APY. So, for example, an account requiring a $500 ongoing balance would rank higher than one requiring you to keep $10,000 in the account. If there is still a tie after considering the minimum ongoing balance, we rank based on the lowest required initial deposit. Ties after that are settled alphabetically.\nRanking Order for Certificates of Deposit\nCertificates of deposit are initially ranked similarly to savings and MMA accounts, with the CD paying the highest APY sorted to the top. The first tie-breaker between any identical rates is the certificate\u2019s maturity term, or duration. Those with a shorter duration are ranked higher than those with a longer term. This is important because not every CD has a standard term of 3, 6, 12, etc. months, with many odd-term certificates existing in the marketplace. We therefore group CDs in term ranges, such as 5-9 months for the 6-month CD ranking, 10-14 months for the 1-year CD ranking, and so forth.\nWhen two CDs are tied both in APY and term, the third sort criteria is the minimum required deposit, with those requiring a smaller deposit ranking above those requiring a large funds commitment. If still tied after this third sort, the CDs are listed alphabetically.\nChoosing the Right Account for You\nWhen deciding where to stash your cash, shopping around can make a world of financial difference. Going with a top rate versus an average rate can net you hundreds or even thousands of dollars over time.\nOur rankings aim to make your decision-making on a savings, money market, or CD account as easy as possible by distilling the rates data from thousands of deposit products and presenting you with the best-paying options. But the account you choose is still a personal decision. You may already have a relationship with an institution that is paying the seventh-best rate instead of the best, making that one much more convenient.\nOr you may want to avoid a particular institution based on a negative past experience, or want to stick with a bank instead of a credit union. Account features like minimum deposit, CD term, and so forth can also make one product a better fit for you than another.\nThat\u2019s why our rankings typically include 15 or more options for every product type, so you can choose the best one for your situation, confident that any one of them is among the top-paying accounts in the nation."

She is currently a full-time staff writer at Investopedia and one of the country's top experts on how to earn as much as possible on the money you hold in the bank. Before joining Investopedia, Sabrina wrote for Bankrate.com, CreditCards.com, DepositAccounts.com, and RateSeeker.\nAnthony Battle is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER\u2122 professional. He earned the Chartered Financial Consultant\u00ae designation for advanced financial planning, the Chartered Life Underwriter\u00ae designation for advanced insurance specialization, the Accredited Financial Counselor\u00ae for Financial Counseling and both the Retirement Income Certified Professional\u00ae, and Certified Retirement Counselor designations for advance retirement planning.\nVikki Velasquez is a researcher and writer who has managed, coordinated, and directed various community and nonprofit organizations. She has conducted in-depth research on social and economic issues and has also revised and edited educational materials for the Greater Richmond area.\nHolding enough money in a checking account to cover your bills and then stashing any surplus cash in a savings account is the traditional model for boosting the bank interest you can earn. But for those willing to regularly use a debit card, significantly higher earnings are available from high-interest checking accounts.\nBelow you'll find the top checking account rates available from our partners, followed by our complete ranking of the best checking account rates nationwide.\nBest High-Yield Checking Accounts\nCredit Union of New Jersey \u2013 6.00% APY\nLa Capitol Federal Credit Union \u2013 5.75% APY\nFitness Bank \u2013 5.25% APY\nGarden Savings Federal Credit Union \u2013 5.12% APY\nPenAir Credit Union \u2013 5.05% APY\nPelican State Credit Union \u2013 5.01%\nSignature Federal Credit Union \u2013 5.00% APY\nIdeal Credit Union \u2013 5.00% APY\nConsumers Credit Union \u2013 5.00% APY\nOrion Federal Credit Union \u2013 5.00% APY\nConnexus Credit Union - 5.00% APY\nPresidential Bank \u2013 4.62% APY\nmph.bank \u2013 4.00% APY\nThese accounts, sometimes called rewards checking, offer a trade-off: If you meet a handful of requirements in any given statement cycle, the bank or credit union will pay you an interest rate for that month that is well beyond what even the best savings accounts offer.\nThe catch is that you need to follow all of the requirements to the letter, and if you miss even one, you'll be paid little or no interest for that month.\nStill, many of the high-yield checking requirements aren't difficult for some consumers, and the payoff can be lucrative. Indeed, our ranking of the best high-interest checking accounts that are available nationwide all pay at least 4.00%, with the top-paying account reaching as high as a 6.00% annual percentage yield (APY). Compare that to high-yield savings accounts, where the best are paying 5.00% APY right now, while the national average rate is only 0.39% for savings accounts and 0.07% for checking accounts as of August 2025.\nNote that all of the high-interest checking accounts listed here require signing up for electronic statements, and most also stipulate that you enroll in online or mobile banking. Additionally, credit unions are significant players in the high-interest checking account arena, populating the majority of our ranking slots. But don't let the name or location of a credit union fool you into thinking you can't bank with them. Many credit unions\u2014and all of the ones we've included in our rankings here\u2014offer a pathway for anyone in the country to join, usually for a modest fee or donation.\nWith its limited balance threshold, it's best for customers who keep relatively minimal funds on hand.\nMaximum balance for top APY: 5.75% APY on up to $10,000.

Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. A rate cut later this year, perhaps as early as September, is expected, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. High-yield checking account rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means checking account rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nWhat Is a High-Interest Checking Account?\nA high-yield checking account is a type of checking account that earns higher-than-average interest. According to the FDIC, the average checking account interest rate is only 0.07% as of March 2025. High-yield checking accounts may earn rates up to 5.00% or higher.\nWhat Is Kasasa?\nEven if you do only a little research on rewards checking accounts, you'll likely see the word Kasasa popping up, and the odd word may leave you scratching your head.\nThat's because Kasasa is a fabricated branding word and the name of a company that offers checking account infrastructure to banks and credit unions. What all Kasasa accounts have in common is that they offer some sort of reward, whether exceptional interest rates, cash back on debit card purchases, or more unconventional perks, and they carry no fees.\nYou May Be Able to Earn Even More\nAs with all banking products, it can pay to shop locally. Our rankings focus on banks and credit unions open to customers nationwide, allowing for accounts to be opened online. But with credit unions being strong players in the rewards checking realm, it's possible that a credit union in your community or state, or that serves your employer, may pay as much or more than the best nationwide options we've laid out. Or perhaps you'll find one with slightly easier requirements.\nThe nationwide leaders above will be hard to beat in most markets. But it's always worth checking the local and regional options available specifically to you before locking into a choice.\nTips for Succeeding With High-Yield Checking\nBy now, you understand you have to actively earn your reward with a high-interest checking account. For most people, these are not accounts you can leave on autopilot and expect to receive the maximum interest payment each month. A little bit of due diligence\u2014both upfront and monthly\u2014is required if you want to maximize your earnings.\nBe Sure You Thoroughly Understand the Requirements\nAs you research options, be sure you fully understand what each account will require of you. Thinking through how you normally use a checking account and what behavior modifications you're willing to make (if any) will help lead you to the best rewards checking account for your needs and style.\nThen, once you've chosen an account, make the time investment of a phone call to a customer service representative at the bank or credit union to ask questions about the specific rules of qualifying transactions. One of the most important things to clarify is what types of debit card transactions will qualify toward the minimum number. Do they have to involve a signature? Can they be PIN-based? Do they have to be at least some minimum dollar amount?\nDon't stop at debit questions, though; familiarize yourself with any requirements about direct deposit or ACH transactions. Also, learn where to review the monthly qualification calendar, which will indicate the first and last days for posted transactions to count towards each monthly rewards cycle.\nSet Some Monthly Reminders\nNow that you know your marching orders for earning top dollar on your checking account balance every month, turn that information into some automated tasks that will help ensure you don't forget. Being deprived of a whole month of interest due to a single misstep can be frustrating.\nAdding a reminder to your phone or calendar for the same day every month, perhaps seven to ten days before the closing date for qualifying transactions, is a best practice that can help you complete any necessary actions while you still have time.\nImportant\nThe date a transaction will count towards your monthly qualification requirements is the posted date, not the actual activity date. Since it can take a day or two for pending transactions to post, be sure to initiate any needed activity a few days before the end of your qualification period.\nWatch Out for Account Maximums\nIf your account has a maximum that you may sometimes bump up against, regularly pay attention to your balance. If you go a few dollars over and it's expected to be a temporary surplus, don't sweat it. But since the interest rate many of these accounts pay on the portion of your balance that exceeds the high-APY threshold is zero, or close to it, you won't want to regularly keep more than the maximum in your account.\nTo see how much difference this can make, take the example of an account with a $10,000 maximum for earning 3.00%. At amounts above $10,000, the account pays just 0.10% APY. If you were to keep a balance of about $20,000 in the account regularly, you'd essentially be lowering your APY on that account to just 1.55% APY (the average of 3.00 plus 0.10).\nPair Your High-Yield Checking With High-Yield Savings\nFor those who find they're being constrained by the maximum balance threshold on their high-yield checking account, a savvy move is to pair it with a high-yield savings account. The savings account can be at the same institution or an entirely different one. You can find our ranking of the top-paying national savings accounts here.\nThe key is simply to create an electronic link between your two high-yield accounts so that you can easily transfer surplus funds that exceed your checking account's maximum allowance into a savings account that may pay 10x as much as the surplus funds would earn in checking. Conversely, if your checking account balance falls below the high-APY threshold, you can transfer funds from savings back to checking to maximize your high-yield earnings.\nPros and Cons of High-Yield Checking Accounts\nPros\nOffer a higher interest rate than traditional checking accounts\nGive you easy access to your cash\nMay come with bonus perks and benefits\nCons\nMay require a certain balance to earn the highest rate\nCould have rules around minimum balances or transactions per month\nRate could decrease over time\nPros Explained\nOffer a higher interest rate than traditional checking accounts: While traditional checking accounts offer an average of 0.07% APY as of March 2025, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), some high-yield checking accounts may offer APYs close to or beyond 5.00%.\nGive you easy access to your cash: Like other checking accounts, high-yield checking accounts are designed for high activity and generally come with a debit card. You can use these accounts to withdraw cash and pay your bills as needed.\nMay come with bonus perks and benefits: Some high-yield checking accounts come with additional perks, such as a cash-back debit card, reimbursement for out-of-network ATM fees, and zero monthly maintenance fees.\nCons Explained\nMay require a certain balance to earn the highest rate: Each institution sets its own rules, but some may require you to have a certain amount of cash in your checking account to access the best rates.\nCould have rules around minimum balances or transactions per month: Along similar lines, some high-interest checking accounts may require you to maintain a minimum balance or conduct a certain number of transactions per month to earn a certain APY, avoid fees, or keep the account open.\nRate could decrease over time: Your checking account rate is not fixed and may fluctuate with market conditions. Over time, you may see your rate decrease and your interest earnings go down as a result. Browse the best CD rates for accounts with a guaranteed return at a specific APY.\nAlternatives to High-Yield Checking Accounts\nA high-yield checking account may not be the best fit for everyone. Here are some alternative options to explore.\nTraditional checking account: Although they don\u2019t earn much or any interest, traditional checking accounts may have other perks that appeal to you, such as no fees, ATM fee reimbursement, or early direct deposit. Browse the best free checking accounts to see if one would work for you.\nHigh-yield savings account: You can often find higher APYs on savings accounts than checking accounts. A savings account is a great place to store cash that you don\u2019t need for everyday spending or monthly bills. See the best high-yield savings accounts to find a good home for your money.\nCertificate of deposit (CD): You might also invest in a CD to earn interest on your money over time. CDs may be a good fit if you don\u2019t need immediate access to your cash, since you could rack up fees if you withdraw your money before the CD\u2019s maturity date.\nMoney market account: These accounts are like a combination of checking and savings accounts\u2014they often come with checks and a debit card while offering a fairly high rate. The downside of money market accounts, though, is they may charge higher fees or have higher minimum balance requirements. See the best money market accounts to explore your options.\nI Bonds:I bonds are U.S. government bonds that can help protect your savings against inflation. You can\u2019t access your cash until at least a year has passed, though.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre High-Yield Checking Accounts Worth It?\nA high-yield checking account may be worth it if earning interest on your checking account balance is a priority. If you only keep a small amount of cash in your checking account, a high-yield savings account may be a higher priority.\nWhen determining whether a high-yield checking account is worth it, keep an eye out for any rules or restrictions that wouldn\u2019t be a good fit for your spending habits, such as account or transaction minimums.\nWhich Banks Pay the Highest Interest on Checking Accounts?\nYes, high-yield checking accounts exist at various banks and online financial services companies. Compare the options above from multiple institutions to find the best APY on a high-interest checking account.\nWhat Is a High-Yield Investor Checking Account?\nA high-yield investor checking account is a checking account that\u2019s linked to a brokerage account and usually has a higher-than-average interest rate. You can find investor checking accounts from brokerages like Charles Schwab. A brokerage checking account may make it easier to invest your money, but you may be able to find a higher checking account or savings account APY from a bank.\nMethodology\nTo choose the best high-yield checking accounts, we scanned online resources for banks and credit unions that offered checking accounts with the highest annual percentage yields (APYs). Institutions had to be federally insured (by FDIC for banks and NCUA for credit unions); the maximum allowable balance that could earn the high rate had to be at least $10,000; and the number of required debit card transactions could not exceed 15.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

We collect, track, and verify CD rates for terms ranging from 3 months to 10 years. All banks and credit unions in our articles must also be federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. A CD\u2019s minimum deposit must not be more than $25,000, and the maximum deposit can\u2019t be less than $5,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify for our best CD rates articles.

To find you the highest 5-year CD rates nationwide, we review CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every day. CD terms of 54\u201366 months are eligible for our 5-year rankings, with minimum deposit requirements of up to $25,000.\nFor savings that are better kept in the bank than invested in the market, certificates of deposit offer a way to earn more than you might with a standard savings account. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 2, 2025.\nBelow are the top CD and annuity rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research that are available to U.S. customers everywhere:\nIn the News\nThe Federal Reserve held rates steady at its July 30 meeting, the fifth consecutive time it has done so. Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. A rate cut later this year, perhaps as early as September, is expected, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nYou can find our ranking of the highest CD rates with terms of 54\u201366 months below.

Even if interest rates tanks after you lock in your certificate, the bank cannot change the rate you agreed to until the five years are concluded.\nPays completely predictable earnings: Since you know the precise rate you'll earn for the full five years of your CD's term, you can determine exactly how much your CD balance will be when your term ends.\nExtremely safe: All CDs held at FDIC banks or NCUA credit unions are insured by the federal government for up to $250,000 per person per institution. So even if the institution fails, your CD funds are protected.\nPotentially higher APY than other options: Depending on the current interest rate environment, 5-year CDs may pay higher rates than savings and money market accounts or shorter CDs. It's not always true, but in times when rates are falling, 5-year CD rates are often the best-paying deposit account.\nDiscourages spending: Because your funds are committed in a CD with threat of a penalty if you withdraw the money early, you may be deterred from the temptation to spend your savings on something unplanned.\nCons Explained\nPenalty is incurred if you withdraw early: When you open a CD, the bank or credit union will spell out in the agreement how it will calculate an early withdrawal penalty should you request to take your money out before maturity. Most typically, you'll have to forfeit a certain number of months of interest.\nOnly allows a single deposit: You fund CDs with a one-time deposit when you open the certificate. Only in \"add-on\" CDs, an uncommon niche product, can you make additional deposits to the same certificate.\nIf rates rise, you're locked at a lower rate until maturity: If interest rates go up while you are locked into a 5-year CD, you will be stuck with your rate until the end of your term, preventing you from capitalizing on the higher rates.\nFuture interest rates are impossible to predict: Over a five-year timeline, it is not possible to forecast if interest rates will rise or fall, or even hold steady for years. So it's difficult to predict whether a 5-year CD rate will be competitive or not several years down the road.\nWarning\nBeware of early withdrawal penalties that can eat into your CD's principal. Losing earned interest when incurring a penalty is to be expected, but avoid certificates where even your principal deposit could be at stake.\nThough banks and credit unions often pay higher rates on 5-year CDs than on shorter terms, this isn't always the case. So it can be smart to consider a shorter CD if it allows you to earn a higher APY. This is especially true if national interest rates are already elevated or are expected to rise in the coming years.\nIn addition to possibly earning a higher rate, choosing a shorter-term CD lets you make another choice with your money sooner than if you have to wait for a five-year term to expire. Just be aware that when your shorter-term CD matures, the rates you're able to get then could be quite a bit less than the rate you were able to lock in for five years.\nHigh-Yield Savings or Money Market Accounts\nAnother option for your funds is a high-yield savings or money market account. When rates are high, the best high-yield savings accounts and best money market accounts may offer rates competitive with a 5-year CD. But it's critical you understand that these are variable rates that can change at any time. If interest rates start going down, so too will savings and money market rates, while CD rates will be locked at your initial APY.\nThe advantage, however, is that you can withdraw your funds at any time from a savings or money market account, giving you more flexibility for funds you're not confident about locking up in a CD.\nBond Investments\nInstead of CDs or bank accounts, you can also put your funds into bond instruments, which come in a wide spectrum of types. For instance, you can buy U.S. Treasury savings bonds, like I bonds or EE bonds. Also backed by the U.S. Treasury are Treasury bills and notes. T bills have durations of up to one year, while Treasury notes have terms of 2 to 10 years. U.S. savings bonds, treasury bills and treasury notes are among the safest investments you can buy.\nYou can also invest in municipal or corporate bonds, though the research and decision-making required to choose individual bonds may be more challenging than many savers are equipped or inclined to decipher. An easier option is to invest in a bond mutual fund or bond ETF (exchange traded fund), which bundles hundreds or thousands of bonds into one fund and enables you to enter and exit the fund anytime you like.\nStock Equities\nFor money you plan to hold as long as five years, a conservative investment in the stock market is an alternative option. And if the five years in which you're invested in the market are a period of growth, you can earn considerably more with stocks than a fixed-rate CD.\nHowever, the significant downside is that preserving your principal is not guaranteed in the market. You can very easily lose some of your investment, unlike money held in a CD. So if keeping your savings reliably intact is important to you, a CD will serve you better than an equity investment.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow Does a 5-Year CD Work?\nOpening a certificate of deposit involves making an agreement with a financial institution that you will deposit a certain amount of money in an account that you won't touch, in exchange for earning a premium on the rate of return. You'll also be guaranteed that interest rate for the life of the certificate.\nFive-year certificates are useful savings vehicles in a number of situations. For instance, if national interest rates are expected to fall over the coming few years (i.e., you're in a declining rate environment), it would be beneficial to lock in one of today's more favorable rates for the coming five years.\nSocking money away in a 5-year CD can also be a helpful strategy if you're saving up for a large financial goal. Perhaps it's money for a down payment on a house. Or maybe you have money saved for your child's college education and you'll need it for tuition in five to six years. By putting it in a CD, you can ensure it earns interest and doesn't lose principal, while also putting a mechanism in place to discourage you from dipping into the funds for other purposes.\nHow Do CDs From Traditional Banks, Online Banks, and Credit Unions Differ?\nCertificates of deposit are available from brick-and-mortar banks, online-only banks, internet banking divisions of traditional banks, and credit unions. For the most part, there is little difference between CDs from these different types of institutions.\nThe biggest difference is that opening a CD with a credit union requires you to be a member of that credit union. The credit union certificates we include in our rankings all allow a method for anyone nationwide to join. However, doing so sometimes requires a small donation or fee (though not always).\nAs for CDs from different bank types, there is little difference. You may be able to make an in-branch visit to physical banks that operate in your area, while you can only open an account at an internet banks online. But aside from the physical presence of a bank (or lack thereof), CDs from different banks will function generally the same way.\nThese different institution types can pay very different rates. Credit unions are not-for-profit institutions and sometimes offer their members better rates than banks do. As a result, you'll see credit unions ranking prominently for longer terms like 5-year certificates.\nOnline banks also tend to pay higher APYs than traditional banks, as their no-presence business model costs less to maintain than brick-and-mortar institutions. These overhead cost savings are often then passed to consumers via better interest rates.\nWhich CD Term Pays the Highest Rate?\nIn theory, the longer you're willing to deposit your funds, the higher the interest rate the bank or credit union will offer you. Unfortunately, this does not always hold true, as the rate institutions are willing to pay depends largely on the market's prediction about where future rates will go.\nFor instance, when rates have been rising for a while and are expected to soon reach a peak, shorter and mid-term CDs often pay the best rates because banks don't want to get stuck paying the current elevated rate for years after rates begin to subside.\nIn contrast, if rates have been low for a while and begin to rise, with expectations they will climb for a bit, banks are more interested in enticing customers with a high long-term rate because they expect rates will be much higher in the future.\nThe good news is that it's easy to see which CD term is paying the best rate at any given time by visiting our daily ranking of the best CD rates. Here you can always see which terms are currently paying the highest yields.\nWhat If I Need to Withdraw My Money Early?\nKeeping your certificate funds on deposit until maturity is the best way to maximize your earnings. But sometimes life gets in the way, with unexpected financial needs arising. For this reason, every bank or credit union offering CDs has a written policy on the penalty it will apply should you cash the CD out early.\nMost typically, the penalty involves you forfeiting some number of months of interest. For example, the early withdrawal penalty on a 5-year CD might be 12 months of interest. That means an amount equal to what the CD would have earned in a year would be deducted from your balance before liquidating the proceeds.\nEarly withdrawal penalties are set individually by each bank or credit union, and they run a wide gamut from mild to exceptionally onerous. But even if you don't expect to need an early cash-out, it's smart to determine the early withdrawal penalty in advance of committing to any CD you're considering.\nHow Do You Build a CD Ladder?\nA CD ladder is a strategy that enables you to earn 5-year rates while keeping a portion of your CD funds accessible every year. Here's how it works:\nDetermine how much money you want to invest in CDs.\nDivide that amount by five.\nOpen a top-paying 1-year CD with one-fifth of the funds, a top 2-year CD with one-fifth, and so forth through a 5-year CD. This will result in five CDs with terms ranging from one to five years.\nAfter 12 months, the 1-year CD will mature. Withdraw the funds and invest them in a new top-paying 5-year CD.\nEvery 12 months, withdraw funds from the maturing CD and reinvest it in a top-paying 5-year CD.\nAfter four years, you'll have a portfolio of five 5-year CDs earning top long-term rates. But one of them will mature every 12 months, giving you periodic access to a portion of your funds.\nFinancial Institutions We Review\nWe researched and reviewed more than 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

5-Year CD Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

A 2-year CD is great because it allows you to lock in a high rate until 2027, even if rates drop on other savings and CD accounts. Our CD rankings below are based on research into hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. We include CDs with terms of 21 to 29 months in our best 2-year CD list. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 2, 2025.\nIn the News\nThe Federal Reserve held rates steady at its July 30 meeting, the fifth consecutive time it has done so. Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. A rate cut later this year, perhaps as early as September, is expected, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nBelow are the top CD and annuity rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research that are available to U.S. customers everywhere:\nBest 2-Year CD Rates\nLafayette Federal Credit Union \u2013 4.28% APY\nClimate First Bank \u2013 4.25% APY\nUSAlliance Financial \u2013 4.25% APY\nPonceBankDirect \u2013 4.25% APY\nSuperior Choice Credit Union \u2013 4.15% APY\nKS State Bank \u2013 4.15% APY\nPrime Alliance Bank \u2013 4.11% APY\nCapitol Federal Savings Bank \u2013 4.10% APY\nE*TRADE from Morgan Stanley \u2013 4.10% APY\nSallie Mae Bank \u2013 4.10% APY\nGenisys Credit Union \u2013 4.10% APY\nConnexus Credit Union \u2013 4.06% APY\nCredit Human \u2013 4.05% APY\nPelican State Credit Union \u2013 4.02% APY\nSkyla Credit Union \u2013 4.00% APY\nIn cases where more than one institution pays the same top rate, we prioritize CDs by the shortest term, then the CD requiring a smaller minimum deposit, and if still a tie, alphabetically by institution name.\nFull details on these top-paying nationally available 2-year CDs are outlined below, including information about minimum deposits and early withdrawal penalty.

This means just one deposit is made at the outset, and no withdrawals are made until the CD matures.\nIf needed, you can withdraw your money early, but it will cost you an early withdrawal penalty. In theory, financial institutions are willing to pay a higher interest rate on longer-term CDs because they can count on the money for a longer period. However, sometimes shorter-term CDs pay a better rate than longer ones, such as when banks and credit unions expect interest rates to drop in the future.\nHow to Open a 2-Year CD\nOpening a 2-year CD is easy. To open a CD, you'll need some personal information including, but not limited to your name, address, and phone number. For example, you may need to provide a copy of your license or ID if you don't have an account with that institution already.\nWhen you have that info handy, fill out the application for your CD account:\nState how you'll fund the CD, whether via an electronic transfer or another method.\nFund the CD.\nState how you want to receive the interest, all at the end or in monthly installments (if required).\nOnce you've done all that, you should officially have a CD in your name, though check with the institution to ensure you've taken all the right steps.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"Opening a CD is not a complicated task and could be done relatively quickly,\" said Lawrence Sprung, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"Have an idea as to the term you want and then look for what financial institution will provide you with the highest rate for that term. Make sure that the CD you choose is covered by FDIC or NCUA insurance and ensure your balance in the CD, including interest, will be below the insurance limits of $250,000 per depositor.\"\nPros and Cons of 2-Year CDs\nPros\nInterest rate fixed for two full years\nBetter return than liquid accounts\nFully predictable earnings\nCan help deter spending\nExtremely safe, with virtually no risk\nCons\nEarly withdrawal incurs a penalty\nOnly allows you to deposit once\nIf rates climb later, you'll be locked at a lower rate\nIf rates decline, you may wish you'd chosen a longer term\nPros Explained\nInterest rate fixed for two full years: The APY of your CD is locked in for the full duration of the CD's term. The bank cannot change it.\nBetter return than liquid accounts: Compared to savings and money market accounts, CDs typically pay a higher interest rate in exchange for you keeping the money on deposit without withdrawals.\nFully predictable earnings: Since you know the CD's interest rate and term when you buy the certificate, you can know exactly how much you'll earn and when it will be available for withdrawal.\nCan help deter spending: Since withdrawals aren't allowed without penalty, money in a CD can reduce your temptation to dip into your savings to spend on an unplanned purchase.\nExtremely safe, with virtually no risk: CDs opened at an FDIC bank or NCUA credit union are covered by up to $250,000 in federal insurance in the unlikely event that the institution fails.\nCons Explained\nWithdrawing early incurs a penalty: If you request to withdraw your funds before your CD's maturity date, the bank or credit union will deduct an early withdrawal penalty from your earnings.\nOnly allows you to deposit once: For the vast majority of CDs, you can make one initial deposit and then that's it. To add more funds, you would have to open another CD.\nIf rates climb later, you'll be locked at a lower rate: The downside of a locked rate is that you may be earning less than current rates.\nIf rates decline, you may wish you'd chosen a longer term: If rates go down, having your rate locked for more than two years might have been preferable.\nTip\nFederal law requires that all banks and credit unions disclose their early withdrawal penalty policy to you before you open a certificate account. If you can't find early withdrawal information on the institution's website, call or chat with a customer service representative to ask what their policy is for the CD term you're considering. Don't choose a particular CD until you have that information.\nAlternatives to a 2-Year CD\nWhile a 2-year CD can be a great investment in certain situations, one of the alternatives may suit certain savers and circumstances better.\nShorter or Longer Term CDs\nCertificates of deposit exist in all variety of term lengths. Though the most common terms range from 3 months to 5 years and follow standard increments, you'll also see CDs with odd terms, like 13 months or 22 months.\nDeciding the right CD term for you depends on two things: your personal financial situation (when will you need the money) and where you think interest rates are headed. When interest rates are rising, you may want to choose a short CD now so that you can use the funds to open one with a better rate in the future. Conversely, if rates are declining, you're generally better off locking in a current rate for as long as you comfortably can, since future CD rates will be lower.\nEven if you know you'd like a CD of a certain length, it's worth shopping around in case you find one that offers a better APY if you stretch just a little longer than your planned duration. Or perhaps you'll decide to open two CDs of different durations to hedge your bets by locking in different rates, but allowing you to access the funds of one CD earlier than the other.\nSavings and Money Market Accounts\nAccounts with free access to your funds are called liquid accounts, meaning you can add or withdraw funds as you like. Examples of these are savings, money market, and brokerage cash accounts. (Checking accounts are also liquid, but they are not considered an alternative to a CD since they generally pay no interest.)\nJust as with CDs, it's critical you shop around when opening a savings or money market account, as the rates vary widely, with some banks paying close to zero while others pay 12 times the national average. You can find the top-paying options in our daily rankings of the best high-yield savings accounts and the best money market accounts.\nBonds and Bond Funds\nInstead of holding money in the bank, you can also invest your funds in various types of bonds. Examples include:\nU.S. Treasury notes, which have terms ranging from two to 10 years. T-bills have terms ranging from four to 52 weeks.\nU.S. Treasury I bonds, which can be held for from one to 30 years, and have a rate indexed to inflation.\nBond funds - Though you can directly buy bonds from municipalities or corporations, most investors find it easier to accomplish this with a bond mutual fund or ETF, which is a bundle of bonds in a certain category. You can also enter and exit these funds at any time, making them very flexible and easy to use.\nWhy You Can Trust Us\nInvestopedia collects thousands of CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking CD rates, we look at factors like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs.\nInvestopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2020. Back when we first started tracking 2-year CD rates, the top interest rate on a 2-year CD was 1.92% APY. By October 2023, the top 2-year CD rate was 5.60%\u2014almost three times what it was three years earlier. While CD rates have fallen since then, they remain high in 2024.\nThe CDs we recommend must be available nationwide and these certificates typically pay three to five times as much as the national average\u2014or even more. To be eligible for our rankings, each CD's minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000 and must be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union (which covers up to $250,000 per depositor).\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAm I a Good Candidate for a 2-Year CD?\nIf you have money you do not need for at least 21 months, then a 2-year CD could be the right fit for you. Two-year CDs are not short or long-term CDs (as with 6-month or 5-year CDs). While shorter CDs are great when you think you might need the money within a year, and long terms like five years are a good way to lock in a high interest rate when it seems interest rates will be declining, 2-year certificates represent a balance between duration and accessibility.\nIf you're saving for a large purchase like a house, car, or boat\u2014or maybe even a big trip\u2014or will be making tuition payments for your child in the next couple of years, 2-year CDs are a good choice. They include a safeguard against you accessing the funds willy-nilly while not keeping your funds locked up for too many years.\nTwo-year CDs may also be appealing when the future of interest rates is uncertain. Interest rates are impossible to predict, but sometimes their direction is widely expected. When the rate environment is very uncertain, however, 2-year CDs strike a balance between knowing you'll have a good rate for the foreseeable future and getting access to your funds thereafter if rates go up or you need your money for something else.\nLastly, many CD ladders involve a 2-year CD. CD laddering is a strategy that enables savers to capitalize on the higher rates offered by long-term certificates but with access to some of your funds sooner (often, once every year). To complete a 5-year CD ladder, you will need at least one 2-year certificate.\nWhat Is the Difference Between CDs From Traditional Banks, Online Banks, and Credit Unions?\nThere is no real difference between CDs that are offered by traditional banks, online banks, or credit unions. The CDs themselves will all act the same way\u2014you deposit your money, agree to the term, and can't withdraw it without a penalty until the term is up. You'll want to compare CDs from all three types of institutions so that you can find one that pays the best interest rate for your money.\nOne difference between these institutions comes from the way you can open the CD. Online banks may require you to wire transfer the money from your checking account to their online CD account, whereas a traditional bank or credit union may allow you to visit a branch and open the CD in person.\nFor online banks, their low overhead expenses\u2014they don't need to operate, staff, and maintain physical branches\u2014allow them to pay higher deposit rates to attract customers. So long as you ensure that the bank is FDIC-insured (or the credit union is NCUA-insured), your protection as a consumer will be the same. Though a bank may operate only online, carrying the FDIC logo indicates it meets all the same regulatory standards as a physical bank.\nAs for credit unions, it's good to be open-minded to these as well, as their rates are often among the top-ranking in any CD term, and especially long terms. The one caveat with opening a credit union CD is that you must first become a member of the credit union. This is generally easy and fast. But it may sometimes involve making a donation to an affiliated nonprofit.\nWhy Are Odd-Term CDs Important to Consider?\nWhen a bank or credit union has a special certificate they want to offer for a limited time, they will often release it as an odd-term product. What \"odd-term\" refers to is a duration that differs from the conventional terms, such as 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, etc. Instead, you might see an 11-month CD or even a 29-month CD, for instance. All that's happening here is the institution is trying to differentiate this CD from its regular menu of standard CDs, both as a marketing tool to make the CD stand out and perhaps also as an internal signal to its staff that this is a limited-time CD.\nIt's wise to pay just as much attention to odd-term CDs as conventional ones because these promotional certificates often offer much higher interest rates. That's also what helps them stand out and draw customers.\nWhat If I Need to Withdraw My Money Early?\nEven when you make the most careful financial plans, you can run into something unexpected that challenges your budget and savings goals. While it's true that CDs involve a lock of sorts, prohibiting you from simply withdrawing the funds at will, every CD institution offers an option to access your funds prematurely. This is called an early withdrawal penalty.\nEssentially, the penalty is the price you can opt to pay the bank in exchange for cashing in your CD early. While some banks allow you to take out just some of your funds, others require you to remove them all and close the CD.\nIn either case, the bank or credit unions should spell out how the early withdrawal penalties are calculated. The most common method is to deduct a certain number of months' of interest from your balance before the remaining funds are paid to you. Typically, the longer the original CD term, the more months of interest you'll pay as a penalty.\nBut buyer beware: Penalty policies vary quite widely, with some even allowing for the penalty to eat into your principal. Even with the best intentions to keep a CD fully funded for the entire term, it's smart to investigate the early withdrawal penalty in advance of committing to any CD, and then only choosing a certificate with a potential penalty you can stomach.\nIs a Jumbo 2-Year CD Worth It?\nBefore opening a jumbo CD, compare the interest rate with that of a regular 2-year CD. Traditional or regular CDs often pay higher rates and require lower minimum deposits. So even if you have a jumbo amount, like $50,000 or $100,000, you may be able to deposit that money in a regular 2-year CD with a higher interest rate, making the jumbo CD not worth it. Compare rates first before deciding which CD is right for you.\nFinancial Institutions We Review\n1st Source Bank, 5star Bank, ableBanking, Abound Credit Union, Achieva Credit Union, Affinity Federal

200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and maximum deposits\u2014if applicable\u2014must not be less than $5,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

      "text": "What Is an NCUA-Insured Institution?\nAn NCUA-insured institution is a financial institution that is a participant in the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) program. Most NCUA-insured institutions are federal- and state-chartered credit unions and savings banks.\nAccounts at NCUA-insured institutions are usually insured through the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). The NCUA operates with a three-member board of directors and runs as an independent federal agency that sets policy.\nKey Takeaways\n- The National Credit Union Association (NCUA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) serve similar purposes for different financial institutions.\n- The NCUA was created to support federal credit unions, which are NCUA-insured institutions.\n- The NCUA was established in 1970, a time of stagflation in the United States.\nHow a NCUA-Insured Institution Works\nAccounts insured in NCUA-insured institutions are savings, share drafts (checking), money markets, share certificates (CDs), Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA), and Revocable Trust Accounts. The maximum dollar amount that is insured in an NCUA institution is $250,000 per institution. In other words, a depositor with $1 million can fully insure this amount by depositing $250,000 in four different NCUA institutions.\nThe National Credit Union Association (NCUA) is equivalent to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The only differences are that the NCUA deals only with credit institutions and that the NCUA uses the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), while the FDIC uses the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nA History of NCUA Insurance\nGovernment oversight of credit unions and protection for funds deposited in credit unions began in the wake of the Great Depression when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Federal Credit Union Act in 1934. Various regulatory bodies oversaw the United States credit unions until the creation of the NCUA. The NCUA was established in 1970, which is when Congress also established the NCUASIF to protect deposits at credit unions around the nation.\nImportant\nBy the end of 2009, over 96 percent of NCUA-insured institutions met the criteria for the designation well-capitalized.\nEconomic upheavals, including the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s and the Great Recession of 2008-2009, threatened the security of the NCUSIF. NCUA-insured institutions collaborated to recapitalize the NCUSIF in 1985 by depositing one percent of their shares into the fund. During the Great Recession, the NCUA worked with the U.S. Treasury Department and Congress to protect the fund and NCUA-insured institutions by creating the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund.\nNevertheless, a number of corporate and consumer-owned credit unions failed during the Great Recession. The NCUA adopted a red flag system to identify threatened member institutions before their financial status became untenable, including a 12-month examination cycle for NCUA-insured institutions."

      "text": "What Is an FDIC Insured Account?\nAn FDIC insured account is a bank or thrift account covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an independent federal agency responsible for safeguarding customer deposits in the event of bank failures. The maximum insurable amount in a qualified account is $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank and per ownership category.\nKey Takeaways\n- An FDIC insured account is a bank account at an institution where deposits are federally protected against bank failure or theft.\n- The FDIC is a federally backed deposit insurance agency where member banks pay regular premiums to fund claims.\n- The maximum insurable amount is currently $250,000 per depositor, per bank.\nUnderstanding an FDIC Insured Account\nAn FDIC insured account means if you have up to $250,000 in a bank account and the bank fails, the FDIC reimburses any losses you suffered. For individuals, any sum that exceeds $250,000 for a single account type (e.g., individual, joint, etc.) may need to be spread among multiple FDIC-insured banks.\nTo understand how, and why, the FDIC functions, it is critical to understand how the modern savings and loan system works. Modern bank accounts are not like safe deposit boxes; depositor money does not go into an individualized vault drawer to wait idly until future withdrawal. Instead, banks funnel money from depositor accounts to make new loans in order to generate revenue from the interest.\nThe federal government requires most banks to keep only 10% of all deposits on hand, meaning the other 90% can be used to make loans. In other words, if you made a $1,000 bank deposit, your bank can actually take $900 from that deposit and use it to finance a car loan or a home mortgage.\nThis kind of banking is called \"fractional reserve banking,\" since only a small fraction of the total deposits are kept as reserves at the bank. Fractional reserve banking creates extra liquidity in the capital markets and helps keep interest rates low, but it can also create an unstable banking environment.\nIt is possible the bank's customers could simultaneously request more than 10% of their money back at any one time. When too many depositors ask for their money back, a so-called \"bank run,\" the bank must turn away some customers empty-handed. Other depositors might lose confidence and ask for their money back too, fearing they will not be able to recoup their savings. Often this can create a contagion-like effect that spreads to other banks, triggering systemic bank panics.\nFDIC Insured Account Requirements\nIf an FDIC-insured bank cannot meet deposit obligations, the FDIC steps in and pays insurance to depositors on their accounts. Once declared \"failed,\" the bank itself is assumed by the FDIC, which sells the bank's assets and pays off any debts owed. When a bank fails, account holders get their funds back almost immediately, up to the insured amount. If their deposits exceed that limit, they will have to wait until the FDIC sells off the bank's assets to recoup any excess.\nA qualified account has to be held in a bank that is a participant in the FDIC program. Participating banks are required to display an official sign at each teller window or station where deposits are regularly received. Depositors can verify whether a bank is an FDIC member through a search at FDIC.gov.\nImportant\nMembership in the FDIC is voluntary, with member banks funding the insurance coverage through premium payments.\nBasically, all demand-deposit accounts that become general obligations of the bank are covered by the FDIC. The type of accounts that can be FDIC-insured include negotiable orders of withdrawal (NOW), checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts, in addition to certificates of deposit (CDs). Credit union accounts may also be insured for up to $250,000 if the credit union is a member of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).\nAccounts that do not qualify for FDIC coverage include safe deposit boxes, investment accounts (containing stocks, bonds, etc.), mutual funds, and life insurance policies. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are insured up to $250,000, as are revocable trust accounts, although coverage on a revocable trust extends to each eligible beneficiary.\nExamples of FDIC Insured Accounts\nFDIC guarantees deposits up to $250,000 per account per person. For joint accounts, each co-owner receives the full $250,000 of protection. Along with the many other benefits of a joint account, a couple or partners with a joint account with $500,000 on deposit would be fully protected.\nMultiple accounts held in the same bank under the same account holder's name are added together for purposes of determining the amount of insured deposits, so a person with two accounts at the same bank totaling $300,000 would have $50,000 unprotected.\nHowever, deposit limits are separate for each different bank, even for the same owner. Say someone has $200,000 at Bank A and an additional $150,000 at Bank B. Even though their total deposits exceed $250,000, they are considered fully covered as long as both banks are FDIC-insured.\nIf this individual transfers the $150,000 to Bank A, they lose coverage on $100,000 since their total deposit at Bank A is now $350,000. Such insurance over deposits benefits savers in that they need only worry about finding the best interest rate on a savings account rather than whether their money is safe.\nHistory of FDIC Insured Accounts\nThe FDIC was created as part of the Banking Act of 1933 after a four-year period that saw nearly 10,000 U.S. banks fail or suspend operations. Most of these closures resulted from a run on the bank; banks did not possess enough money in their vaults to meet depositors' withdrawal demands, so they had to close their doors, leaving many families without their savings.\nThe purpose of the FDIC was to restore the faith of panicked Americans following the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. Conceptually, the FDIC serves as a bulwark against future banking panics. The FDIC \"insures,\" or guarantees, the value of all bank demand deposits up to a certain amount, with the total figure covered steadily growing since its inception.\nFast Fact\nIn October of 2008, Congress increased the amount covered by FDIC deposit insurance from $100,000 to the current $250,000.\nPrior to 2006, the FDIC financed itself through the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). These were basically composed of insurance premiums the FDIC charged to member banks for housing and safekeeping their funds.\nIn 2005, President George W. Bush signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act to merge the competing funds. Since then, all premiums are left in the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), from which all FDIC-insured deposits are covered.\nSpecial Considerations\nThe FDIC reserve fund has never been fully funded; in fact, the FDIC is normally short of its total insurance exposure by more than 99%. Congress granted the FDIC the power to borrow up to $500 billion from the Department of the Treasury, making the system effectively backed by the Federal Reserve. In other words, if the FDIC exhausts its other options, the government will step in to provide further financial backing.\nThe FDIC can also borrow money from the Treasury in the form of short-term loans. This occurred during the savings and loan (S&L) crisis in 1991, when the FDIC was forced to borrow several billion dollars to cover the failing thrifts' accounts.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of FDIC Insured Accounts\nAccording to the FDIC, no depositor has lost a cent of insured funds as a result of bank failure since its insurance debuted on Jan. 1, 1934. Measured on the merits of preventing bank panics, the FDIC has been a resounding success\u2014the U.S. economy has not suffered a legitimate banking panic in the 80-plus years of the FDIC.\nThe FDIC isn't loved by everyone though. Detractors believe forced deposit insurance creates moral hazard in the banking system and encourages depositors and banks to engage in riskier behavior. They argue that customers do not need to care which bank makes safer loans if the FDIC is going to bail them all out anyway.\nWhy Is it Important to Choose a Bank Account That Is FDIC-Insured?\nPerhaps the most significant benefit of having a FDIC-insured deposit account is that the deposit insurance ensures up to $250,000 ($500,000 for a joint account) for each account ownership category in the event of a bank failure.\nWhat Are 3 Things not Insured by FDIC?\nThree of the biggest things that the FDIC doesn't insure are stock investments, bond investments, and mutual funds. Life insurance policies; annuities; municipal securities; safe deposit boxes (and their contents); U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, and notes; and crypto assets are also not covered by FDIC deposit insurance.\nIs it Good to Have all Your Money in One Bank?\nIt can be safe to have all of your money in one bank, but this is not without risk. If your account balances at one bank exceed $250,000 (or $500,000 for a joint account), then that excess amount won't be covered by FDIC deposit insurance in the event of a bank failure. In this scenario, you would be better off keeping some of your funds in a different financial institution.\nThe Bottom Line\nBank failures, although somewhat uncommon, still happen. From 2001 to 2022, 561 banks failed, with four failing at the onset of the pandemic back in 2020. An FDIC insured account offers the peace of mind that your deposited funds will be safe should the worst happen to your bank of choice."

      "text": "What Is a Credit Union?\nA credit union is a type of financial cooperative that provides traditional banking services. Ranging in size from small, volunteer-only operations to large entities with thousands of participants spanning the country, credit unions can be formed by large corporations, organizations, and other entities for their employees and members.\nCredit unions are created, owned, and operated by their members. As such, they are not-for-profit enterprises that are accorded tax-exempt status.\nKey Takeaways\n- Credit unions are financial cooperatives that provide traditional banking services to their members.\n- Credit unions have fewer products than traditional banks, but offer clients access to better rates and more ATM locations.\n- They can do so because they are not publicly traded and only need to make enough money to continue daily operations.\n- However, credit unions have fewer brick-and-mortar locations than most banks, which can be a drawback for clients who like in-person service.\n- Credit unions are exempt from paying corporate income tax on their earnings.\nUnderstanding a Credit Union\nCredit unions follow a basic business model. Members pool their money (technically, they are buying shares in the cooperative) to provide loans, demand deposit accounts, and other financial products and services to each other. Any income generated is used to fund projects and services that will benefit the community and the interests of members.\nRequirements for Membership\nOriginally, membership in a credit union was limited to people who shared a common bond. They may have worked in the same industry or for the same company. Or they may have lived in the same community.\nHowever, credit unions have loosened the restrictions on membership and often allow the general public to join.\nTo do any business with a credit union, you must join it by opening an account there (often for a nominal amount). As soon as you do, you become a member and partial owner.\nThat means you participate in the union's affairs. You may vote to determine the board of directors and decisions concerning the union. A member\u2019s voting right is not based on how much money is in their account; each member gets an equal vote.\nAccording to the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), membership in federally insured credit unions grew to 136.6 million as of March 31, 2023.\nFast Fact\nTotal assets in federally insured credit unions as of March 31, 2023, were $2.21 trillion.\nAdvantages of Credit Unions vs. Banks\nNon-Profit Status\nAs with banks, the process of making money at credit unions starts by attracting deposits. In this, credit unions have two distinct advantages over banks, both resulting from their status as nonprofit organizations:\n- Credit unions are exempt from paying corporate income tax on earnings.\n- Credit unions need to generate only enough earnings to fund daily operations. As a result, they can work with narrower operating margins than banks, which are expected by shareholders to increase earnings every quarter.\nBetter Rates and Fees\nThe profits that credit unions do make are used to pay members higher interest rates on deposits, and to charge lower fees for services, such as checking accounts and ATM withdrawals. In short, a credit union can save members money on loans, deposit accounts, and savings products.\nAccording to NCUA data as of March 31, 2023, the national average rate for five-year certificates of deposit (CDs) offered by credit unions was 2.66%, compared to an average rate of 1.83% offered by banks.\nMoney market rates at credit unions were also higher, with an average rate of 0.53% versus the average bank rate of 0.43%.\nWhile these differences sound small, they do add up, giving credit unions a significant advantage over banks when competing for deposits.\nImportant\nCredit unions provide better rates on most mortgages, including 15-year and 30-year fixed mortgages, which could be a good option if you are looking to purchase a home.\nDisadvantages of Credit Unions vs. Banks\nFewer Locations\nCredit unions have considerably fewer brick-and-mortar locations than most banks, which can be a drawback for clients who like in-person service. Most offer modern services such as online banking and auto-bill pay. Still, the small size of many credit unions can mean a compromise on accessibility.\nLower Tech\nSmaller credit unions typically do not have the same technology budget as banks, so their websites and security features are often considerably less advanced. That said, some mid-sized and larger credit unions may offer mobile banking apps that rival those of much bigger, for-profit institutions.\nLimited Products and Services\nWhile credit unions offer most of the financial products and services that banks do, they often provide less choice. Bank of America has 20 different credit card options, ranging from rewards cards to student cards, while the Navy Federal Credit Union (NFCU) has only six. The second-largest credit union in the country, the State Employees\u2019 Credit Union (SECU), offers one credit card.\nLess Flexibility\nWith more resources to allocate to customer service and personnel, banks are keeping later and longer hours. You may find them open until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on weekdays and often on Saturdays, as well. Credit unions tend to maintain traditional bankers' business hours (9 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday), though the larger ones, such as SECU, have a 24-hour customer service hotline.\nInsurance on Credit Union Accounts\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does not cover credit unions. However, the NCUA, which was established in 1970 and regulates federally chartered credit unions and most state-chartered credit unions, does provide account protection.\nIn fact, one of the NCUA's main responsibilities is to administer the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), which uses federal monies to back up shares (deposits) in all federal credit unions.\nThe NCUA provides coverage for each individual account, joint account, trust account, retirement account (such as traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, or Keogh plan accounts), and business account for up to $250,000 per account.\nFor example, if you have an individual account, a Roth IRA, and a business account at a credit union, your total shares are insured up to $750,000.\nYou can research credit unions of interest that the NCUA regulates at the NCUA website.\nWhat Benefits Do Credit Unions Offer?\nNormally, credit unions offer higher rates on interest-bearing accounts, lower rates on loans, lower fees, and a more personal touch when it comes to customer service.\nCan Anyone Join a Credit Union?\nNowadays, you'll find more credit unions offering membership to all. Some still have specific eligibility requirements, though, so be sure to check out a credit union's \"field of membership\" section on its website for details about joining.\nHow Do I Join a Credit Union?\nOnce you've located a credit union that interests you, you should be able to find membership specifics and an application to join on its website. The application usually requires the kind of personal information related to opening a financial account (which is what you're doing as part of applying for membership). You'll then need to make a deposit to fund the account you've chosen.\nThe Bottom Line\nCredit unions are significantly smaller in size than most banks and are structured to serve a particular region, industry, or group. And though they may have fewer branches, they can still provide customers ample access to their funds as many credit unions are part of expansive ATM networks.\nWhile credit unions must make enough to cover their operations, any profit beyond that goes back to the members in the form of lower fees and account minimums, higher rates on deposits, and lower borrowing rates.\nCorrection\u2014Feb. 12, 2025: This article has been corrected to state that the NCUA was established in 1970."

She is currently a full-time staff writer at Investopedia and one of the country's top experts on how to earn as much as possible on the money you hold in the bank. Before joining Investopedia, Sabrina wrote for Bankrate.com, CreditCards.com, DepositAccounts.com, and RateSeeker.\nBrian Abbott is a proven editor with years of experience researching and reporting on financial data, including personal banking products such as CDs and checking/savings accounts.\nThe best 1-year CD rate right now is 4.50% APY from HUSTL Digital Credit Union\u2014nearly 2.8 times the national average rate for a 12-month CD. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 2, 2025.\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) allow you to lock in a fixed rate on your savings for a certain amount of time. Opening one now could be an especially smart move because yields are expected to fall later this year when the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. CD rates have declined from their peak in the past couple of years, but they're still in the mid-4% range, well above inflation.\nInvestopedia has been researching CD rates every business day since 2019, tracking more than 200 banks and credit unions offering nationally available CDs. Below are the top CD and annuity rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research.\nTo find you the best 1-year CD rates nationwide, we look at factors that help readers choose the best CD, like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. CDs with terms of 10 to 14 months and minimum deposit requirements of up to $25,000 are eligible for our 1-year rankings.\nIn cases where more than one institution pays the same annual percentage yield (APY), we've prioritized CDs by the shortest term, then the CD requiring a smaller minimum deposit, and if still a tie, alphabetically by institution name.\nTip\nThe CDs in this list may be a good fit if you're looking to reach a short-term savings or investment goal. If a 1-year CD is too much of a commitment though, you can always consider the best CD rates now for shorter terms or even a top-paying high-yield savings account.\nWhy You Can Trust Our Recommendations for the Best 1-Year CD Rates\nInvestopedia collects thousands of CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking CD rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best CD, like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit.\nInvestopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2019. Back in 2019 when we first started tracking CD rates, the highest rate on a 1-year CD was 2.60%. Over the years, we've seen CD rates decrease and then increase again to the levels they are at now. The top 1-year CD rate today is over 2x what the top rate was when we started writing about the best CD rates in 2019.\nThe CDs we recommend must be available nationwide and these certificates typically pay three times the national average. To be eligible for our 1-year CD rankings, each CD's minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000 and must be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union (which covers up to $250,000 per depositor). Terms of 10 to 14 months are included in our 1-year CD rankings.\nOverview: HUSTL debuted in 2024 as a digital division of Vantage West Credit Union, which dates back to 1955 and is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona.

CommunityWide was founded in 1967, and now operates in Michigan and Indiana.\nThe Federal Reserve held rates steady at its July 30 meeting, the fifth consecutive time it has done so. Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. A rate cut later this year, perhaps as early as September, is expected, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nWhat Is a 1-Year CD and How Does It Work?\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) with a 1-year term are special types of accounts with interest rates that are usually higher than other savings accounts. In exchange for the high rate, you must keep your funds locked up for about 10 to 14 months. This may be good for your short-term savings since you can access the money by next year.\nThe reason banks and credit unions are willing to pay higher rates on 1-year CDs is because they can generally count on those funds staying in the account, unlike funds that can come and go unpredictably in a savings, money market, or checking account.\nBanks and credit unions offer CDs in a variety of terms, from 1 month up to 10 years, so you can choose how long you're willing to lock up your funds. The most common CD terms, however, range from 6 months to 5 years, with 1-year certificates being the most widely available of all.\nThe date your CD ends is called its maturity date, and although it\u2019s not impossible to withdraw your funds before maturity, you\u2019ll incur a financial penalty if you do so.\nFast Fact\nWhen asked in June where they would be most likely to put an extra $10,000, 11% of Investopedia readers said they would choose CDs, above high-yield savings accounts and stock index funds, but trailing individual stocks and ETFs.\nWho Is a CD Best For?\nCDs are best for people who want to grow their money in a low-risk account and can afford not to touch it for months or years. They're good for short- to medium-term goals like buying a home. A CD could help you save for the down payment, earning a guaranteed rate that's more than you'd get on a basic savings account, and without the risks of investing in the stock market. Because CDs have an early withdrawal penalty, they're also helpful if you want to make sure you're not tempted to tap your savings for other expenses.\nOther types of accounts are generally better for long-term savings, such as for retirement. Historically, the stock market has delivered better returns than CDs over the long term. But as you get closer to retirement, you may want to diversify your portfolio and lower your risk by putting some of your money into a CD.\nIf you're building up emergency savings, you'd be better off choosing a high-yield savings account instead of a CD. If you suddenly need to access your money for an unexpected cost, it will be much easier to withdraw from a savings account than a CD.\nIs a 1-Year CD Right for You?\n\"We got two 1-year CDs because the interest rates were better than what we were earning on our savings accounts. It was very simple to sign up and only took a few minutes at the bank. The time frame for the CD was good; short-term worked for us in case we need the money,\" said Helen Koby, a retired New Jersey resident who opened two 1-year CDs with her husband in 2023.\nPros and Cons of the Best 1-Year CDs\nPros\nFixed rate for a full year\nHigher APY than liquid accounts\nPredictable earnings and date of withdrawal\nExtremely safe account\nHelps deter spending\nCons\nWithdraw early and pay a penalty\nCan't add to deposit\nIf rates rise, you may miss out\nIf rates drop, you may wish you had a longer-term CD\nPros Explained\nFixed interest rate for a full year: Once you open a CD, you lock in the rate you\u2019ll receive for the full term, no matter what the Federal Reserve does or how other interest rates move. This is a big advantage if rates are predicted to fall, and it can help you stay on track toward your short-term savings goals.\nHigher APY than liquid accounts: Banks and credit unions are willing to pay higher rates on CDs, where they know the money will stay put, than on savings, money market, and checking accounts, where you can withdraw funds more often.\nFully predictable earnings and date of withdrawal: Since a CD\u2019s rate and term are fixed, you know exactly when you\u2019ll be able to withdraw the funds and exactly how much interest you\u2019ll have earned by that date.\nExtremely safe, with almost no risk: When you open a CD at an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union, you are federally protected on up to $250,000 in deposits, even if the institution fails.\nHelps deter spending: If you find it hard not to dip into your savings, the early withdrawal penalty on CDs can serve as a useful roadblock to unwanted spending.\nCons Explained\nEarly withdrawal of the funds will incur a penalty: If you find you need the funds in your CD sooner than the maturity date, you\u2019ll be hit with an early withdrawal penalty that will reduce your earnings.\nYou can\u2019t add to your deposit: Once you make your deposit for a CD, that\u2019s a final decision. You cannot make additional deposits or add money.\nIf rates rise, you may miss out on a higher rate: If rates go up while you own your CD, you may have been able to score a higher rate if you had locked in later.\nIf rates drop, you may wish you\u2019d chosen a longer CD: Alternatively, if rates begin declining, you may regret not locking in your great rate for a much longer duration.\nTip\nBe sure to carefully review the terms of your prospective CD before signing off on it and funding the account. But if you change your mind about the CD within the first few days of opening it, some banks offer a grace period enabling you to quickly exit penalty-free.\nHow Much Money Does $1,000 Make in a Top-Paying 1-Year CD?\nThe amount of money in interest that a $1,000 deposit can make in a 1-year CD will depend on the interest rate. Below are three different scenarios based on three different interest rates you could get on a 1-year CD:\nDeposit\nAPY\nCD Term\nInterest Earned\nTotal\n$1,000\n5.00%\n1 Year\n$50.00\n$1,050.00\n$1,000\n4.75%\n1 Year\n$47.50\n$1,047.50\n$1,000\n4.50%\n1 Year\n$45.00\n$1,045.00\nThe higher your deposit, the higher the interest you will earn from a CD. If you had $10,000 to deposit in a 1-year CD with these same rates, you could earn between $450 and $500 in interest in one year (as long as you do not withdraw your money early).\nHow to Find the Best 1-Year CD\nShop around to learn where the highest 1-year CD rates are offered. You may find CD options at banks, credit unions, or even brokerage accounts.\nThe best 1-year CD for you will be where you feel most comfortable stashing your cash and leaving it for 12 months. While 12 months can feel like a long time, it may help you reach your short-term savings goals faster.\nLook at the early withdrawal penalty. If you need the money sooner than the term's end, you'll likely pay this penalty (though there are some CDs with no penalties).\nCompare your options, review the terms, and then deposit the money to start earning interest.\nHow to Open a 1-Year CD\nOpening a CD is generally no more difficult than opening a savings or checking account. Follow these steps\u2014almost all of the certificates in our rankings of the top nationally available CD rates can be opened online within 10 or 15 minutes.\nProvide personal information and identify yourself in the application\u2014online or in person.\nSpecify how you\u2019ll fund the new CD. The most common approach is an electronic transfer from another financial institution. However, depending on the institution, you may also have options to send a check or wire money.\nRead the written terms of your CD agreement, which will stipulate the interest rate you'll be paid, the date of the CD's maturity, the frequency with which your interest will be paid and compounded, and the specific penalty calculation that will be used if you request to withdraw your funds before maturity.\nImportant\nIf you are funding the new certificate with a very large deposit, you\u2019ll want to check with the institution on any external transfer limits that could be an obstacle.\nOnce your CD is open and funded, it's generally a \"set it and forget it\" product. You'll receive monthly or quarterly statements showing your certificate's growth, but hopefully, you can leave the funds untouched until the maturity date rolls around.\nAlthough the bank or credit union will notify you in advance of the CD maturing, it's wise to set a calendar reminder for yourself so you can be ready with a decision on what to do with the funds when the CD expires.\nWhen Is the Best Time to Get a 1-Year CD?\nThe best time to get a 1-year CD is right before interest rates drop. There's no easy way to know when that will happen, though, so you'll have to decide when the time is right for you.\nFor example, if the 1-year CD you're planning to open has a rate of 5.00% APY right now, and you believe the Fed will lower the fed funds rate in the next month or two, then now might be the best time to get that CD. That's because CD rates typically track the fed funds rate, so if the Fed lowers rates, your choice of 1-year CD could also see its rate fall.\nOf course, the best time to get a CD will also depend on your situation, and you may need to have a certain amount for the deposit, as well.\nNote\nThe national average interest rate for a 1-year CD is 1.76% APY, according to the FDIC. The best CD rates nationwide are nearly three times higher, so be sure to shop around to find the winning rate and institution for you.\n\"Before purchasing a CD, make sure you know what would happen if you needed to break the CD prematurely,\" said Douglas Boneparth, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"Would you be giving up all or some of the interest you've earned?\"\nFor a one-year term, the most common EWP is three or six months' worth of interest. What that means is, if you cash in your CD before its maturity date, the funds returned to you will be docked by the amount of interest the CD would have earned in three or six months.\nBut don't assume all EWPs are similar, or even reasonable. You may find one that charges a whole year's worth of interest, while another assesses a mild 30 days' interest. Still others have more complicated or onerous policies that can even eat into your principal. That's why due diligence is critical before funding any CD. You want to be sure you understand what you're signing up for. And when two choices are relatively equal, choose the CD with the milder penalty.\nCD Rates From Big Banks and Credit Unions\nSome of the biggest banks and credit unions\u2014like the ones you may see commercials for on TV\u2014don't offer the highest CD rates. When choosing a CD, we always recommend looking for one with a high interest rate, a minimum deposit that you can afford, and a term that works for your timeline. If one of the top nationwide CD rates doesn't meet your needs, you can always look at a big-name bank or credit union. You may already have a relationship with one of these institutions, making opening a CD easy. Here are a few banks and credit unions you may want to explore:\nA 1-year CD won\u2019t be the best savings option in all cases, of course. Fortunately, there is no shortage of alternatives, depending on your situation.\n1-Year CDs vs. Longer-Term CDs\nIf you can leave your funds untouched for longer than a year, it\u2019s worth shopping the longer CD terms, such as 18 months or 2 years. You may be able to score a higher rate on one of those CDs. Or you may want to opt for a CD rate that\u2019s not quite as high, but that will last further into the future.\n1-Year CDs vs. Shorter-Term CDs\nIf you want to move some of your money from regular savings into a CD, but you just don\u2019t feel comfortable with the year-long commitment, 3-month and 6-month CD terms are available from most banks and credit unions that sell CDs.\n1-Year CDs vs. Savings Accounts\nIf one year seems like too long to keep your money locked up in a CD, a savings account may be a better option. But don't open just any savings account\u2014a high-yield savings account that pays a competitive interest rate is best. While you may not be able to earn as much as the highest rate on a 1-year CD, you will still earn more than you would in a traditional savings account. Plus, the money is accessible whenever you need it.\n1-Year CDs vs. Money Market Accounts\nAnother option if you want to keep your money more accessible is a money market account. A money market account acts like a savings account, but allows check-writing privileges. Money market accounts also pay high interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts and allow more flexibility with withdrawals than a CD.\nNote\nRemember that the interest rates on liquid accounts, like savings and money market accounts, can change at any time.\n1-Year CDs vs. Investing and Brokerage Accounts\nInvesting accounts can help you save and invest money in stocks, bonds, ETFs, index funds, and more. However, when you invest money like this, usually with a brokerage, it's not as easy to withdraw it if you should need it.\nWhile CDs come with early withdrawal penalties and taxes on the earnings, investing accounts work differently. If you sell investments you may be selling them for more or less than you bought them for. You may have to pay capital gains taxes, which vary depending on how long you invested the money. It may take a few days to get your money from the broker and into your bank account.\nWith a CD, you know exactly when you'll get the money back after the term ends. You may also be able to open a CD right at your current bank or credit union. You'll also be taxed on the CD's earnings, but it's taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gains taxes.\nNote\nSome brokerage and robo-advisor accounts also offer cash management accounts that pay high interest rates and can house your uninvested cash, much like a savings account.\n1-Year CDs vs. I Bonds\nI bonds are U.S. government bonds designed to protect your savings against inflation, hence the name. But while they sometimes pay rates much better than CDs, sometimes the rate is inferior. For example, for I bonds issued between May 1, 2025, and October 31, 2025, the interest rate is 3.98%. Also, you absolutely cannot withdraw your funds from an I bond until one year passes, not even with a penalty. CDs, on the other hand, allow you to withdraw before the term is up, with a penalty.\n1-Year CDs vs. U.S. Treasuries\nTreasuries allow you to lend money to the U.S. government for a fixed amount of time. Considered one of the safest investments in the world, a T-Bill is a note with a duration of up to 1 year. Unlike CDs, interest earned on Treasuries is not subject to state income tax. Treasuries are also more liquid because you can sell them before maturity on the secondary market. While there's no guarantee what price you'll get when you sell a Treasury early, there is no official penalty, as there is with a CD.\n1-Year CDs vs. Bond Funds\nThough it is difficult to research individual bonds, such as corporate offerings, you can easily invest in a bond mutual fund or ETF, which is diversified across many different bond issues. You can enter and exit the fund at any time, but bonds are uninsured and could lose value. When interest rates are high, a CD may have a better return than a bond; when the opposite is true, a bond generally pays more in interest.\n1-Year CDs vs. Money Market Funds or Cash Reserve Accounts\nIf you have a brokerage account, you can hold savings in the brokerage\u2019s cash reserve account or its money market fund. Just be sure to research what rate you\u2019ll earn because, in many cases, it will be far less than what you can earn in an outside CD, savings account, or money market account. Money market funds are not insured by the FDIC, but they are insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC) for up to $500,000, including $250,000 in cash.\nAs with a money market account, money market funds are more liquid than CDs. You can withdraw your money whenever you want. But their APY is also variable, so it could change at any time.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho Has the Highest 12-Month CD Rate Today?\nHUSTL Digital Credit Union has the top rate of 4.50% APY today for a term of 12 months. Opening an account online is fairly easy, with an affordable minimum deposit of $500.\nWhat Is a 1-Year CD Paying Right Now?\nRight now, the best 1-year CDs have APYs in the mid-4% range, much higher than the national average rate. Depending on the day, the top 1-year CD may or may not hold the title for best CD rate overall.\nCan You Get 6% on a 1-Year CD?\nYou may be able to get a 6% interest rate or higher on a 1-year CD that is offered by a local or regional bank or credit union. Right now, though, there are no 6% CDs offered nationwide. With higher rates, there are often more rules such as minimum deposit requirements, specific terms, or large penalties. For our list of the best 1-year CD rates, we rank CDs that are available nationwide and do not have a minimum deposit of more than $25,000.\nWhat Is the Best Place to Open a 1-Year CD?\nThe best place to open a CD will be a bank or credit union that pays the highest rates. These may differ from the big bank you work with for your checking account. In fact, some of the biggest banks pay among the worst rates. In contrast, smaller brick-and-mortar banks, online-only banks, and credit unions tend to offer substantially higher returns. Our daily rankings of the best CD rates is an easy way to find the top nationwide rates.\nYou may also wonder about the inconvenience of having your funds at more than one bank. With CDs, however, this is not a big deal since you won\u2019t be regularly interacting with your CD account. Even with a savings or money market account, internet transfers between institutions are easy these days. But you won\u2019t be making transfers to or from your CD account until you cash out.\nAre 1-Year CDs a Good Short-Term Investment?\nA 1-year CD will be a good short-term investment for you if you can deposit money and leave it untouched for 10 to 14 months. If so, finding a 1-year CD with a high interest rate can offer returns of 4.50% or more. For example, if you deposit $5,000 in a 1-year CD (12 months) with a 4.50% APY, you'd earn $225 by the end of the term. If you need the money sooner than that, consider a 6-month CD.\nHow Much Will a $10,000 CD Make in a Year?\nA 1-year $10,000 CD could make $450 if it's paying the top rate of 4.50%. But your earnings will depend on the rate you get. The national average for CDs right now is only 1.75%, so if you get a CD at that rate, you'll only earn about $175. Your payout also depends on how often the interest is compounded. More frequent compounding means a slightly higher payout.\nAre 1-Year CDs Safe?\nCDs are safe because they are usually insured by the FDIC or NCUA when they are opened at a bank or credit union. If you open a CD at a brokerage, check to see what type of insurance the account has. As with other bank accounts, your money at a bank or credit union is insured for up to $250,000 per depositor (across all your accounts at that institution). Each time you open an account at a new bank or credit union, your money at that institution is insured for up to $250,000 as well.\nCan You Lose Money on a 1-Year CD?\nGenerally speaking, you can't lose the money you deposit in a 1-year CD if you only withdraw it when the term has matured, or there's no penalty. Most CD accounts are also insured by the FDIC or NCUA, so your money is safe if it's at a bank or credit union with this insurance. The only time you can \"lose\" money on a 1-year CD is if you withdraw it early and there's a penalty, such as the loss of one month's worth of interest. But in that case, you'd only lose interest, not your initial principal payment.\nFinancial Institutions We Review\nWe researched and reviewed over 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

CD Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

She is currently a full-time staff writer at Investopedia and one of the country's top experts on how to earn as much as possible on the money you hold in the bank. Before joining Investopedia, Sabrina wrote for Bankrate.com, CreditCards.com, DepositAccounts.com, and RateSeeker.\nAmanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\nThe best high-yield savings account rate is 5.00% APY, available from Varo Bank and AdelFi. That's more than 13 times the FDIC's national average for savings accounts of 0.39% APY. A high-yield savings account is great because it pays more interest, while still giving you the flexibility to withdraw your money when needed. Every business day, we publish a ranking based on the highest savings account APYs available that day from nationally available institutions. All savings accounts and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 2, 2025.\nIn the News\nThe Federal Reserve held rates steady at its July 30 meeting, the fifth consecutive time it has done so. Three rate cuts late last year lowered the federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25%\u20134.50%, its lowest range since February 2023. A rate cut later this year, perhaps as early as September, is expected, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. High-yield savings account rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means savings rates are expected to come down if the Fed lowers rates.\nBelow, you'll find our partners' savings and cash management accounts\u2014from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks\u2014followed by our top 15 ranking of the best savings account rates available nationwide.\nBest High-Yield Savings Account Rates for September 2025\nNote that some banks call their savings accounts \"money market\" accounts. Money market accounts traditionally offer the ability to write checks, while savings accounts do not. None of the accounts listed here offer check-writing privileges, even if the name might suggest otherwise. It's smart to also check our ranking of the best money market accounts, some of which pay comparable interest rates.\nCompare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts\nThe top savings account rates in the country are listed below in order of APY. Where more than one financial institution has the same rate, we rank them in order of the lowest monthly deposit requirement, the lowest minimum balance requirement, and the lowest opening deposit requirement.

When ranking high-yield savings account rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best savings account, like minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best high-yield savings account rates since 2019.\nWhat Is a High-Yield Savings Account?\nAs the name implies, high-yield savings accounts pay much higher interest rates than traditional ones. Often offered online, whether by an internet-only bank or the online division of a brick-and-mortar bank, they're a type of savings account that's based on the idea of holding your savings wherever it can earn a competitively high yield, even if that's a different bank than where you hold your checking account.\nThe difference in savings account interest rates can be dramatic, with the top accounts in the country typically offering 10 to 12 times the national average rate. And you can still keep your checking account where it is, because it's simple to link a high-yield savings account to your primary account for easy transfers.\nReasons to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nStashing some of your cash in a savings account is smart whether you're saving for something specific, or just want to sock money away for when you'll need it in the future. Here are some common reasons to open a savings account:\nBuild an emergency fund: By putting your emergency money in a high-yield account, you'll be able to boost your balance with monthly interest earnings, while also leaving your funds fully accessible should a financial emergency arise.\nReach a specific goal: This may include buying a house or a car, sending your son or daughter to college, or going on a special vacation.\nGrow your savings: Earning interest on your money means your savings balance will grow faster than if you were making monthly contributions and not earning anything.\nExpert Take\nI first opened a high-yield savings account with American Express in 2019, and have urged friends and family to open high-yield savings accounts, too. While Amex doesn't offer the top rate nationwide, it has a great mobile app, which is how I do most of my banking. I can see my high-yield savings account right next to my credit cards, and can easily deposit money from my checking to my savings via the app. ~Hilarey Gould, Editorial Director at Investopedia\nHow Much Will a High-Yield Savings Account Pay on $1,000, $5,000, or Higher Balances?\nThe amount of money you can earn in a high-yield savings account will be based on how much you deposit and what your interest rate is. Based on initial deposits of different amounts from $1,000 to $100,000, we calculate below what your balance would be at the end of one year if you put the funds in a top-paying high-yield savings account, paying 5.00%, vs. a savings account paying the national average of 0.39% APY.\nWarning\nNote that while you can earn a great deal more than the national average rate, your bank may also pay a lot less. For instance, Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo all pay close to zero interest on their traditional savings accounts, at just 0.01% APY.\nAPY\n$1,000 balance\n$2,500 balance\n$5,000 balance\n$10,000 balance\n$20,000 balance\n$50,000 balance\n$100,000 balance\n1 year of earnings at the national average rate\n0.39%\n$1,004\n$2,510\n$5,019\n$10,039\n$20,078\n$50,195\n$100,391\n1 year of earnings at today's top rate\n5.00%\n$1,050\n$2,625\n$5,250\n$10,500\n$21,000\n$52,500\n$105,000\nAdded earnings from HYSA\n+ $46\n+ $115\n+ $231\n+ $461\n+ $922\n+ $2,305\n+ $4,609\nOf course, you can boost your balance even more by regularly adding deposits to your savings account. One smart way to do this is to set up an automated transfer from your checking account once a month.\nHow to Choose the Best High-Yield Savings Account\nOnce you've decided to open up a new high-yield savings account, you'll want to do your homework to make sure you're choosing the best one for your needs. Searching for a top annual percentage yield (APY) is a good starting point when choosing a high-yield savings account, as you'll want to earn a competitive rate.\nThough the interest rate can change, it makes sense to choose an account that is paying one of the highest rates in the country, since the higher your rate, the more interest you'll collect every month and every year. Also, through the power of compounding, you can make interest off your interest, and the higher the APY on your account, the better.\nBut beyond the interest rate, you'll also want to make sure the account either doesn't have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that you feel confident you can regularly maintain. Also, note if there is a minimum balance required to earn the top APY.\nWhy Different Banks Pay Different Rates\nEach bank is a business that has different needs for customer deposits, operating in its own regional market. As a result, some banks have to work harder to attract funds, such as smaller banks with names you may not be familiar with.\nAlso important is the lending activity the bank is undertaking. If, for instance, a bank is in a strategic push to build its commercial lending portfolio, it will need to attract more customer deposits in order to fund those loans it hopes to make. One way they can do this is offering a promotional APY for a short period to boost their deposits balance, but then lowering it after they've accumulated enough funds.\nCommon Savings Account Terms to Understand\nWhen researching high-yield savings accounts to find the best one for you, be sure you understand what these commonly used terms mean.\nMinimum opening deposit or initial deposit: Some bank accounts\u2014whether a savings, checking, or money market account\u2014stipulate a minimum deposit you need to make to open the account. It could be quite low, like $25, or could be as much as $25,000 for some high-balance accounts. And some accounts have no requirement, letting you open the account with no money deposited. Note that if an account has a initial deposit requirement but then no minimum ongoing balance, you do not need to keep that money at the bank after your initial deposit.\nMinimum balance requirement or ongoing balance: Unlike a minimum initial deposit, a minimum balance requirement refers to the least amount of money you can keep in the account on an ongoing basis. For instance, a bank may require your balance to stay at or above $100 or $1,000 for its account\u2014or any other amount the bank prefers. Falling below the minimum requirement could mean being hit with a fee, or could instead mean you won't earn the high-yield interest rate on the account. So be sure the account you choose either has no minimum ongoing balance or one that you feel confident you can always stay above.\nMonthly maintenance fee: Banks and credit unions charge various types of fees. Unlike ones triggered by a transaction, such as an insufficient funds fee or a wire transfer fee, the monthly service fee is a standard fee you could be charged every statement cycle. Many accounts do not have a monthly maintenance fee, while some others provide ways for you to avoid the fee each month. Be sure you understand the fee rules for any account you're considering.\nMobile check deposit: The ability to deposit checks using the camera on your smartphone or tablet\u2014rather than having to take the check to a branch\u2014is called mobile check deposit or remote check deposit. Most institutions' mobile apps offer this as an easy way to get money deposited into your account.\nExternal or ACH transfer: The electronic process of moving funds between two financial institutions is called an external or ACH transfer. Virtually every high-yield savings account allows you to send or receive external transfers so that you can easily move money in and out of your savings account.\nHow to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nAfter comparing the best high-yield savings account and landing on a choice, the next step is to open the account online. Here's how that generally works:\nThe bank or credit union will ask you to provide various personal information, including your social security number, since your interest earnings will be reportable to the IRS.\nThe bank's account opening process will also involve security measures designed to ensure you are who you say you are.\nYou'll also be presented with one or more options on how to fund your account. The most common method is by ACH transfer from another bank, and you'll be provided with instructions on how to set this up.\nAlternatively, some institutions allow you to make your initial deposit with a debit card, a credit card, or even a paper check sent through the mail.\nOnce the application process is completed, you may be able to set up online banking right away, or you may need to wait a day or two for your account to be fully opened.\nTip\nTransfers between different institutions will take one to three days to complete, so be sure to keep enough of a cash cushion either in your checking account or in a linked savings account at that same institution. That way you won\u2019t run into trouble if you can\u2019t get funds from your high-yield account for a couple of days.\nPros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts\nPros\nHigher APY than traditional savings accounts\nAbility to withdraw or deposit funds at any time\nExtremely safe, with virtually no risk\nExcellent vehicle for an emergency fund or saving for a big goal\nIn times of rising rates, your APY may go up\nCons\nEarning a top yield may require opening an account with a new institution\nSome accounts have withdrawal limits of six per month\nEasy access can make it tempting to dip into savings\nAccount could have a fee or minimum balance requirement\nIn times of decreasing rates, your APY may go down\nWho Is a High-Yield Savings Account Best For?\nAnyone with surplus savings in the bank can benefit from a high-yield savings account. If you have more money in the bank than you need to hold in your checking account, high-yield savings accounts offer a way to sock some of those funds away to earn an especially high annual percentage yield (APY). High-yield savings accounts are also well suited to those comfortable with internet or mobile banking, as moving money in and out of an online savings account must generally be done on your computer or via a mobile banking app on your phone.\nWhen choosing the best savings account for you, you'll want to check the rules of the account, such as whether it limits the number of withdrawals you can make in a month, and if you'll be assessed a monthly maintenance fee. Lastly, check that the bank is an FDIC member (or an NCUA member if it's a credit union) so that your money is insured by the federal government\u2014up to $250,000 per depositor\u2014should the bank or credit union fail. Online reviews of a bank's customer service may also prove useful.\nAlternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts\nHigh-yield savings accounts are just one vehicle for stashing your cash, and they often pay the highest APYs. But there are several alternatives for holding your funds until you need them.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Checking Account\nWhile the easiest place to keep surplus funds is in your checking account, this has two major downsides. First, money kept in your everyday checking account is very easy to spend, making it difficult to leave earmarked as savings. Second, checking accounts tend not to pay any interest\u2014or if they do, the rate is a pittance. A high-yield savings account offers an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on your money.\nSome high-yield or rewards checking accounts do exist, with rates that are more competitive. But these accounts require jumping through some hoops\u2014sometimes every month\u2014in order to earn their high rate. Still, if you're a heavy debit card user, one of the best rewards checking accounts may be a good option for you.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Traditional Savings Account\nThere is no formal definition of how high a rate needs to be to qualify as \"high yield\". In short, it's up to each institution how to name their savings accounts. Traditional banks and credit unions more often offer traditional savings accounts, while online banks are more likely to offer a high-yield savings account. But again, the distinctions are fuzzy, rather than hard-and-fast rules.\nWhy You Don't See Big Name Banks on Our List\nWe track the savings account rates of over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. While we do check the rates at big banks\u2014including the five largest banks of Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, and U.S. Bank\u2014their rates aren't usually high enough to make our ranking. Meanwhile, other institutions may not qualify for our ranking because they aren't available to customers in at least 40 states, or they significantly limit the balance on which you can earn their high-yield APY.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Money Market Account\nA money market account operates very much like a savings account, with the exception that it allows writing checks. In the past, money market accounts typically imposed high minimum deposit requirements in exchange for higher rates than savings accounts. This has shifted in recent years, however, with savings and money market accounts both having a variety of required minimum balances\u2014including no-minimums accounts. In addition, high-yield savings accounts often pay more competitive rates than money markets, though sometimes you can find a higher APY among the top-paying money market accounts.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"When a client has money they won't need in the next 12 to 24 months, I encourage them to take advantage of a high-yield savings account or money market account to hedge against inflation as well remove the funds from their actively used checking accounts. Basically, a 'hands off account,'\" said Sibyl Slade, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nIf some of your savings can be socked away and not touched for a period of time, you may be able to earn a higher rate with a certificate of deposit. CDs require you to commit your funds to remain on deposit for a number of months or years, imposing a penalty if you request to withdraw the funds before the CD\u2019s maturity date. But in exchange, your interest rate is locked and guaranteed, even if the Fed lowers rates. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs can lead you to the highest available APYs no matter the CD term you choose.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat does \"HYSA\" mean?\nHYSA is simply an acronym for \"high-yield savings account\". In contrast to traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts aim to attract customers and their deposits by offering a much more competitive interest rate.\nAre High-Yield Savings Accounts Safe?\nSome people wonder if you can lose money in a high-yield savings account. In a worst-case scenario, a savings account will pay no interest, meaning your funds don't grow at all. But you would never lose the money you put into the account, other than due to fees you've been assessed. So it's important to choose an account where you can easily avoid paying any fees.\nAs for losing money due to a bank failure, the vast majority of banks\u2014whether physical or online\u2014are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits per institution if the bank fails. The U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers for up to $250,000 by providing insurance through the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).\nThat means whether your institution is a traditional brick-and-mortar bank with branches or is an online bank or credit union, and whether it\u2019s big or small, your deposits up to $250,000 are equally safe and protected.\nWho Has the Highest-Paying High-Yield Savings Account?\nThe top-paying institutions for savings accounts vary, with no one bank perpetually leading the rate rankings. In general, the top rate contenders tend to be online operations, whether owned by a physical bank or set up as a fully online-only institution. You can always find today's highest rates\u2014currently near 5.00%\u2014and the institutions that offer them by regularly checking our ranking in this article. Or for a list that is exclusive to banks (no credit unions), you can check our daily ranking of the best banks for savings accounts.\nWhich Banks Are Paying 7% Interest on High-Yield Savings Accounts?\nWhile it would be nice to earn 7% on money held in savings, no banks or credit unions are paying that much on a regular savings account. The only account paying a 7% APY right now is a savings account for kids, but only on balances up to $1,000. Savings account rates surged in 2023 and 2024, thanks the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike campaign. But at its highest point, the top savings account rate available to anyone in the country reached 5.55% APY in April 2024.\nHow Much Does a High-Yield Savings Account Get Taxed?\nWhat any bank offers in interest\u2014whether paid on a savings, checking, money market, or CD account\u2014will need to be reported on your annual tax return. You'll be able to see on your monthly statement or online register how much you were paid each month, and at the end of the calendar year, it will be taxed along with all of your other income from employment and other sources.\nThe bank where you hold your high-yield savings account will not tax you directly, but in January of each year, they will send you and the IRS a Form 1099-INT indicating how much interest you were paid in the previous calendar year. You must then report this interest income on your tax return.\nDo High-Yield Savings Account Rates Change?\nThe APY on a savings account is variable, meaning what it pays when you first open your account will most likely change sometime in the future, and it can change at any time without warning.\nWhether the rate goes up or down, and how often it changes, is largely influenced by the Federal Reserve. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, banks and credit unions often follow suit in the same direction.\nThat said, rate changes among savings accounts are not typically a daily or weekly event. Barring recent moves by the Fed, rates often remain at the same level for weeks or months at a time.\nCan You Ever Lose Money With a High-Yield Savings Account?\nThe risk of losing money in a high-yield savings account is very low. Banks and credit unions are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable, but they are guaranteed based on the balance in the account (the bank won't take that money back after paying it to you). So if you're worried that a high-yield savings account comes with the same risk as investing in the stock market, think again. These accounts are much safer and there's virtually no risk of losing money in the account (unless you spend it of course).\nWhat Are the Downsides to a High-Yield Savings Account?\nThere are few drawbacks to putting some of your money into a high-yield savings account. The primary downside is that your money will likely reside at a different institution than where you do your primary banking. As a result, you may not be able to instantaneously transfer money from your high-yield savings to your primary checking account, as transfers between banks generally take 1-3 days.\nThis issue can be easily handled, however, by making sure you keep some level of cash cushion at the bank where you have your checking, enabling you to make a quick transfer to checking if you need it.\nWhich Banks Do You Track for High-Yield Savings Accounts?\nEvery business day, we check the savings account rate for about 100 banks and credit unions that offer their accounts to customers nationwide.

We determine daily rankings of the top-paying savings accounts first and foremost by the annual percentage yield (APY) offered. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the savings account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
