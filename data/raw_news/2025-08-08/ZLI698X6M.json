  "description": "The suit filed in Miami federal court accuses Ricardo Casanova of siphoning corporate funds from Alejandro Chab\u00e1n\u2019s businesses over several years.",
  "content": "Telemundo star and former Puerto Rico beauty queen Aleyda Ortiz\u2019s husband was accused of stealing $1.6 million from a popular Latino fitness influencer, according to a lawsuit.\n\nRicardo Casanova, a financial advisor who has been married to the TV host for eight years, allegedly siphoned corporate funds from Alejandro Chab\u00e1n, a Venezuelan-born entrepreneur, wellness advocate and television personality, the $4.8 million civil theft lawsuit claims.\n\nCasanova worked as Chab\u00e1n\u2019s financial consultant beginning in 2017, with access to corporate bank accounts and financial records, according to the filing in Miami federal court on July 30.\n\nThe complaint alleges that from 2017 until his removal in 2024, Casanova transferred and withdrew company money without permission, channeling it to himself under the guise of compensation far beyond what had been agreed upon.\n\nChab\u00e1n\u2019s attorney, Miranda Soto, said the claim is being brought under Florida\u2019s Civil Theft Statute, which allows for triple damages in cases of proven theft.\n\n\u201cMr. Casanova systematically took funds to which he was not entitled from 2017 until he was discovered in 2024,\u201d Soto said in a statement posted to social media.\n\n\u201cHe violated the trust placed in him and his fiduciary duty to Mr. Chab\u00e1n and his companies. This lawsuit not only seeks to protect Mr. Chab\u00e1n\u2019s businesses, but also his employees, partners, and investors.\u201d\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Chab\u00e1n, Ortiz and attorneys for Casanova.\n\nThe case has attracted attention in Spanish-language media in the US and Latin America thanks to Chab\u00e1n\u2019s reputation as a trusted wellness figure and Ortiz\u2019s status as a prominent television host.\n\nOrtiz, 36, won a reality beauty competition in 2014 and finished as first runner up in Miss Universe Puerto Rico competion that same year.\n\nShe has appeared on Telemundo programs, including the morning lifestyle show \u201cEn casa con Telemundo\u201d as well as the celebrity dance competition \u201cMira Qui\u00e9n Baila.\u201d\n\nOrtiz has not publicly commented on the lawsuit.\n\nChab\u00e1n, 43, is widely recognized in the Hispanic community for his transformation from an overweight child into a prominent advocate for health and fitness.\n\nHe has hosted television programs, written best-selling books such as \u201cThink Skinny, Feel Fit: 7 Steps to Transform Your Emotional Weight and Have an Awesome Life.\u201d\n\nHe also founded \u201cYes You Can!,\u201d a Miami-based nutrition and wellness brand.\n\nHis public image blends his entertainment career with a focus on physical and emotional wellbeing, and his companies market products and lifestyle plans aimed at Latino consumers in the US and abroad.",

      "text": "Wealthy New Yorkers say Amex Black Cards have lost their cachet\nHave credit cards lost their prestige?\nA few years ago, whipping out an Amex Black Card was the ultimate status symbol \u2014 so much so that the hip-hop collective A$AP Mob even wrote an entire song about it. But that was 2017.\nNow? It\u2019s all about practicality, not ego. A wealthy subset tell me they are increasingly choosing cards that either offer a suite of banking features, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, or act as your dream assistant that can get you into Le Veau d\u2019Or and plan your entire trip to San Sebastian, like Atlas.\nWhile companies like American Express and Capital One don\u2019t break out the numbers for the cards targeted at high-net-worth clients, it is clearly still an alluring space for companies.\nPopular trading app Robinhood unveiled a limited-edition 10-karat gold card last year. Amex Platinum, Citi Strata Elite, and Capital One Venture X have also invested in metal cards that have more weight and gravitas than the plastic \u201cstarter credit card\u201d you get in college.\nBut the cool factor just isn\u2019t there anymore. People tell me high-end credit cards aren\u2019t a signal of wealth the way they used to be. (That\u2019s what Instagram is for.)\nPart of it has to do with the fact that people aren\u2019t pulling cards out of their wallets as much due to the rise of alternative payment methods like Apple Pay. A growing number of restaurants are even sending customers a link where they can pay the tab online, and of course everyone is online shopping.\nThe other reality many people are realizing is it\u2019s no good to whip out a black (or gold) card if you\u2019re eating at a second-rate restaurant. And that is where other companies are trying to swoop in to win over consumers.\nAtlas has developed a devoted following of yuppy types since its launch in 2019. CEO Patrick Mrozowski told me he believes that people are choosing his card because he provides a valuable service.\n\u201cWe are a concierge company first and a credit card company second,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focused on building an amazing concierge service, hiring the best travel agents, and building personal relationships with restaurants.\u201d\nThose relationships have resulted in members getting some of the most competitive reservations in the city, like the Corner Store.\nThis story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC\u2019s power players (and those who aspire to be).\nOther cards, like the Centurion, do provide perks \u2014 complimentary hotel and airline upgrades, free access to airport lounges, a club in New York City, the promise of aspiration reservations, and annual credits at Saks Fifth Avenue \u2014 but not typically at the level of Atlas.\nMeanwhile, the Bilt Rewards card has distinguished itself by emphasizing community engagement over traditional credit card offerings and has partnerships with local restaurants like Delmonico\u2019s and fitness studios like SoulCycle.\nAnother trend that is complicating things for high-end credit card companies is the fact that big spenders are spreading out purchases between multiple cards.\nZach Perrett, the CEO of Plaid, which provides technology to help connect bank accounts to fintech apps for over half of banked Americans, told me he is seeing people using half a dozen cards.\n\u201cPeople are connecting four or five, six or seven credit cards into a budgeting application,\u201d Perret told me. \u201cSome of this is because you want to spend money on the card that is relevant to the thing that you\u2019re purchasing. Let\u2019s say you have a Delta card, you want to put your travel on your Delta card.\u201d\nOne person who recently canceled his black card and is now splitting purchases among a Delta card, a Chase Sapphire card and a handful of other cards said it was like paying for a club you never use.\n\u201cThe only benefit was the airport lounges, but now those have fallen off a cliff \u2026 I never used any of the other benefits they touted like personal shopping,\u201d he explained. \u201cI paid more for this than most of my private club memberships in the city \u2014 I couldn\u2019t justify it anymore.\u201d"

      "text": "Uber received sexual misconduct reports every eight minutes during six-year period: unsealed court docs\nUber received more than 400,000 complaints of sexual assault or sexual misconduct in the US against the ride-hailing app\u2019s drivers between 2017 and 2022 \u2014 far more than the 12,522 the company disclosed publicly, according to a blockbuster report.\nThe attacks amounted to one nearly every eight minutes, the New York Times reported, citing unsealed court records.\nThe claims are contained in documents that were recently unsealed as part of massive litigation against Uber, which has long promoted itself as one of the safest transportation options available.\nMore than 2,300 victims from across the country have joined together in one big case, accusing the company of failing to screen drivers properly, ignoring warning signs and putting profits over passenger safety.\nThe victims combined their complaints into a consolidated multidistrict litigation whereby major trial motions such as discovery are streamlined \u2014 though each individual plaintiff must still prove their case.\nA judge ruled in July that these cases can move forward, and the first trials \u2014 known as bellwether trials \u2014 are scheduled to begin in San Francisco federal court in December.\nThe Post has sought comment from attorneys for the plaintiffs.\nUber denies claims it hid sexual assault data, arguing that most of the 400,000 reports from 2017 to 2022 were minor, unaudited or false. The company said the reported incidents amounted to just 0.006% of total trips.\n\u201cThe most serious reports were even rarer, at 0.00002%, or 1 in 5 million,\u201d Uber stated.\nHannah Nilles, Uber\u2019s head of safety for the Americas, acknowledged to the Times that roughly 75% of these reports involved what she termed \u201cless serious\u201d incidents, including inappropriate comments about appearance, unwanted flirting or explicit language.\nShe also noted that the reports haven\u2019t been independently audited and could potentially include fraudulent claims from users seeking refunds.\nThe company has not released data on any incidents since 2022, though reports of sexual attacks have increased, according to court records cited by the Times.\nIn one harrowing incident in December 2023, a woman in Houston alleged that she was raped by her Uber driver after a ride that was supposed to last 22 minutes ended five hours later at a Motel 6.\nUber\u2019s systems sent three automated notifications during suspicious stops, but the woman did not respond, and the driver, who was previously accused twice of misconduct, completed the ride at 2:01 a.m., the records show.\nIn May and July last year, Uber documented cases where drivers allegedly assaulted intoxicated passengers \u2014 including a driver in St. Louis accused of forcing a passenger to perform oral sex before picking up other riders.\nAccording to internal documents, Uber officials were lax in implementing safety reforms that were recommended by the company\u2019s own data scientists, including mandatory video recording and pairing female passengers with female drivers.\nDespite developing sophisticated safety tools that proved effective in testing, Uber delayed or chose not to implement some of the most promising solutions, the Times reported.\nThe company created an algorithmic system called Safety Risk Assessed Dispatch that could anticipate 15% of sexual assaults in its basic ride service during Los Angeles testing in 2018.\nInternal presentations described it as potentially the \u201cmost effective intervention for preventing sexual assaults.\u201d\nHowever, a 2024 internal document revealed a critical flaw in the technology, which \u201cstill dispatched trips identified as high-risk.\u201d\nA company official told the Times that completely blocking high-risk trips, such as late-night pickups from bars, would strand many people and potentially encourage dangerous alternatives like drunk driving.\nThe documents also revealed that Uber\u2019s safety decisions were influenced by priorities including user base growth, lawsuit avoidance and protecting its business model that classifies drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, according to the Times.\nThis distinction proves crucial for the company\u2019s financial structure, as contractors don\u2019t receive benefits, oversight or employment protections that traditional workers would have.\n\u201cOur purpose/goal is not to be the police,\u201d stated a 2021 internal brainstorming document about global safety standards.\n\u201cOur bar is much lower and our goal is to protect the company and set the tolerable risk level for our operations.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s own research identified clear patterns in sexual assault incidents, according to the Times.\nWomen represent the majority of victims whether they\u2019re passengers or drivers, with attacks typically occurring late at night and on weekends, often involving pickups near bars.\nMale perpetrators usually had histories of sexual misconduct complaints and poor user ratings, according to internal analyses cited by the Times.\nNilles told the Times that Uber expects company data covering 2023 and onward to show that the rate of \u201ccritical sexual assaults\u201d fell to the lowest level in years.\nThe company also defended its record, saying it\u2019s invested billions in safety, cut serious assault rates by 44%, and developed tools like S-RAD to improve driver-passenger matching.\nS-RAD stands for Safety Risk Assessed Dispatch, an internal Uber algorithm designed to improve trip safety by prioritizing better driver-passenger matches based on risk factors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Uber has been more transparent on the issue of sexual assault than any other corporation,\u201d the company wrote in a statement."

      "text": "JPMorgan predicts Fed will cut rates in September \u2014 and four total times this year\nJPMorgan is now predicting the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates when it next meets in September \u2014 and four times overall before the end of the year \u2014 as pressure mounts to ease monetary policy.\nThe nation\u2019s largest bank, led by Jamie Dimon, expects a quarter-point cut after the Fed\u2019s two-day meeting on Sept. 16-17, followed by three more cuts of the same size at their remaining meetings \u2014 which would bring the benchmark rate down to a range between 3.25% and 3.5%.\nJPMorgan\u2019s earlier projection was that the Fed would wait until December to start lowering rates.\nThe bank\u2019s analysts pointed to signs of weakness in the labor market, including a softer jobs report and rising jobless claims, as the main reason for the accelerated timeline.\nThe unemployment rate in July ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1% the previous month.\nMarket pricing also reflects growing confidence in a September move.\nTraders now price in a 89.2% chance of a rate cut in September, compared with 37.7% last week, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\nPresident Trump has repeatedly pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates, arguing that cheaper borrowing costs are necessary to boost economic growth and lower the government\u2019s interest expenses.\nOn Thursday, Trump nominated Stephen Miran, his current chief economic adviser, to fill a temporary seat on the Federal Reserve\u2019s governing board, replacing outgoing Governor Adriana Kugler.\nMiran\u2019s confirmation before the Sept. 16\u201317 policy meeting remains uncertain, but JPM said his presence could increase divisions within the rate-setting committee.\nMiran is viewed as a strong supporter of Trump\u2019s economic agenda and has consistently favored lower interest rates.\nSome of Miran\u2019s earlier proposals have included shortening the terms of board members and increasing presidential authority over the Fed.\nIf confirmed, Miran would serve through January 2026, giving Trump time to decide whether to nominate him for a full 14-year term or consider him for other leadership roles at the Fed, including the chairmanship.\nA Bloomberg News report from Thursday cited sources as saying that Trump aides consider Fed Governor Christopher Waller as the top contender to succeed Powell, whose term ends next May.\nTrump has made no secret of his frustration with Powell\u2019s refusal to start slashing rate despite the administration\u2019s calls for steep reductions.\nPowell has warned that cutting too quickly could allow inflation to flare up again \u2014 especially given the inflationary effects of Trump\u2019s new tariffs and expansive fiscal policies.\nThe disagreement has turned personal. Trump has repeatedly derided Powell in public, calling him a \u201cmoron,\u201d a \u201cnumbskull,\u201d and one of his \u201cworst appointments.\u201d\nHe has urged Powell to resign and has even shown lawmakers a draft letter dismissing him, though he later said he did not plan to fire Powell before his term ends.\nIn July, tensions escalated when Trump visited Fed headquarters and engaged in a visibly strained exchange with Powell over cost overruns in a $2.5 billion renovation project.\nTrump suggested those overruns could be grounds for dismissal.\nAlthough the Supreme Court has indicated a Fed chair cannot be removed over policy disagreements alone, Trump\u2019s comments fueled speculation that he might try to use management issues as a pretext for removing Powell.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been ruled out as a candidate for Fed chair, told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Thursday that the president \u201crepeatedly said he\u2019s not going to fire\u201d Powell."
