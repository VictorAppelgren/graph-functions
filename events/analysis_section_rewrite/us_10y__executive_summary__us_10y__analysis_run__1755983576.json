      "feedback": "Your draft is fact‑rich but too verbose for a professional investor brief and mixes multiple themes (labor economics, ACMR, geopolitical risk, macro policy) into a single paragraph, diluting the house view. Tighten it to 4–6 bullet‑style sentences that first state the core thesis (high‑quality, AI‑upskilled workforces will out‑perform the Russell 1000 by ~18 % over 3–5 yrs), then quantify the driver (e.g., JUST Capital index out‑performed by 17.3 % as of Aug 2025, 15–20 % projected outperformance, 4LQD15CFU). Next, list the key catalysts: ACMR Q3 earnings, N2 bubbling rollout, Fed rate cuts, export‑control easing (SK994CBWR). Follow with the primary risks: AI regulatory constraints, Fed tightening (LZG5YWQMC), geopolitical escalations (7YQN9WX3, U1KRCQOYR). End with watch signals: Fed minutes, CPI, ACMR guidance, Lavrov statements, trade‑policy updates. Remove redundant sentences (e.g., repeated ACMR data), eliminate generic phrases (“moderate‑high confidence”), and replace them with concrete confidence levels (“confidence 70‑80 %”). Ensure every claim is cited with a single ID and that all critical sources are referenced (4LQD15CFU, SK994CBWR, LZG5YWQMC, 7YQN9WX3, U1KRCQOYR). This will produce a concise, decision‑useful brief that aligns with the section focus.",
