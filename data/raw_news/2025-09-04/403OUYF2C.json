FOR ON DEMAND NEWS 24 HOURS OR DAYS SUBSCRIBE TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCAST. THAT IS A BLOOMBERG BUSINESS FLASH. > > LET'S GET BACK TO ONE OF TODAY'S TOP STORIES AND THAT IS THE U.S. CONSUMERS STILL SPENDING EVEN IN THE FACE OF HIGHER PRICES. WE ARE JOINED BY CLAUDIA SAHM, CHIEF ECONOMIST THAT NEW CENTURY ADVISORS. THE WORD I KEEP HEARING TO DESCRIBE THE PCE REPORT WE GOT AT 830 A YOUNG THIS MORNING IS STICKY. YOU THINK OF CORE PCE COMING IN ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. ON A MONTHLY'S BASIS AT 3.3%. IT FEELS LIKE THE 2% TARGET THE FED WANTS TO GET TO REMAINS ELUSIVE. CLAUDIA: ABSOLUTELY. WE ARE NO LONGER MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE FED'S 2% TARGET. EARLIER THIS YEAR YOU COULD POINT TO PROGRESS. RIGHT NOW I WOULD SAY WE HAVE STALLED OUT. THERE HAS BEEN A ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT TARIFFS AND HOW THIS COULD BE A TEMPORARY FACTOR. YOU DO SEE THAT IN THE GOODS INFLATION BUT I THINK IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME FOR IT TO WORK ITS WAY OUT. A LIFT TO INFLATION. THE PART OF THE PCE INFLATION THAT WAS DISCONCERTING WAS ON THE SERVICES SIDE PARTICULARLY THE NON-HOUSING CORE SERVICES THAT THE FED REFERS TO AS SUPER COURT. WE LOOKED LIKE WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS EARLIER THIS YEAR. WE ARE BACK UP AT A PACE OF INFLATION IN THOSE CATEGORIES THAT IS NOT COMFORTABLE. AND IS NOT POINTED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IT IS HARDER THERE TO POINT TO TARIFFS. BAILEY: NOT GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- IS THE ENVIRONMENT RIPE FOR A RATE CUT AT NEXT MONTH'S MEETING? CLAUDIA: I THOUGHT CHAIR POWELL DID A GOOD JOB LAST FRIDAY OUTLINING THE RISKS TO THE ECONOMY. THIS IS A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE DUAL MANDATE IS IN TENSIONS. THERE ARE REASONS FOR INFLATION TO GO HIGHER FROM WHERE IT IS, IT IS ALREADY ELEVATED. AND THERE ARE REASONS TO BE WORRIED ABOUT EMPLOYMENT GOING LOWER AND HAVING SOME DETERIORATION IN THE LABOR MARKET. IT IS A MATTER OF SIFTING THROUGH EVERY BIT OF DATA TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE BALANCE OF RISKS IS. THERE IS NO PATH FOR THE FED THAT WILL CHECK BOTH BOXES. THEY ARE IN TENSION. I AGREE WITH THE ASSESSMENT THAT DOING MAY BE AN INSURANCE CUT IN SEPTEMBER TRYING TO STAY AHEAD OF THE LABOR MARKET WEAKNESS MAKES SENSE GIVEN WHERE THE FED FUND RATE IS BUT I DON'T SEE THE CASE FOR THE SIGNALING LIKE GOVERNOR WILDER DID LAST NIGHT THAT WE ARE LINING UP A SEQUENCE OF CUTS. I HAVE A FEELING WILL WE -- WE WILL BE BACK IN THE PUSH AND PULL OF INFLATION AND LABOR TO THE END OF THE YEAR. KATIE: CONSIDER THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THE DUAL MANDATE AND THE TWO SIDES ARE IN CONFLICT. WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN A DYNAMIC LIKE THIS FOR A WHILE. IF WE DO ENTER A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE THE LABOR MARKET WEAKENING BUT YOU HAVE CORE INFLATION STUCK MAY BE CLOSER TO THREE THAN IT IS 22%, REALISTICALLY, HOW MUCH ROOM DOES THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAVE TO CUT RATES? IF THEY ARE STUCK IN A STOP AND GO SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TO RATE CUTS, HOW MUCH OF THESE ONE-OFF BASIS POINT CUTS WILL MATTER IN THIS ECONOMY? CLAUDIA: AS POWELL MENTIONED, WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS LOW AS IT IS AND AS STABLE AS IT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST YEAR, THEY CAN PROCEED CAREFULLY. AND AT 25 BASIS POINTS, A CUT AT ONE MEETING, MAYBE WE CUT AGAIN SOON OR MAYBE WE DON'T. THAT IS WHAT \"CAREFULLY\" LOOKS LIKE IN THE FED WORLD. THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE SPACE IF THINGS IN THE LABOR MARKET WERE TO REALLY GAIN DOWNWARD MOMENTUM. THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IS ABOVE 4% AND THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM TO CUT AND RESPOND IF THEY NEED TO. THEY WILL SWITCH GEARS. THE DATA -- THEY ARE NOT THERE YET. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT HAPPENING BUT TALKING ABOUT A RISK. THEY ARE IN A GOOD PLACE BUT MY GOODNESS, IT IS SO HARD TO CATCH THE ECONOMY WHEN IT IS TURNING. WE TALK ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET AS A POTENTIAL TURN BUT YOU COULD HAVE INFLATION TAKE OFF. THESE KIND OF MOMENTS WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT, IT IS VERY TOUGH. THEY MAY GET IT WRONG BUT I THINK THAT IS WHERE BEING CAREFUL AND DELIBERATE WILL BE THE STRATEGY THAT WORKS FOR THEM. BAILEY: WE HAVE A STRONG SET OF DATA WE WILL GET BEFORE THAT SEPTEMBER FED MEETING. WHAT CAN VINDICATE THE PUSH TO DOING A QUARTER-POINT CUT IN SEPTEMBER? CLAUDIA: THE LOGIC OF THE SET UP FOR THE SEPTEMBER CUT IS MORE AN INSURANCE SPACE. IT IS ABOUT RISK. WE HAVE ONE INFLATION PRINT, ONE EMPLOYMENT PRINT. WILL THAT CHANGE THE PICTURE OF RISK? PROBABLY NOT. THE EMPLOYMENT REPORT LAST MONTH WAS A GAME CHANGER BUT THAT IS A RARE OCCURRENCE. THEY ARE ON A PATH TO BUILD A CUT. THIS IS A TOUGH ONE. I CAN SEE REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ON THE INFLATION SIDE WHERE WE WILL GET STUCK AT 3%. I THINK WE WILL SEE SOME DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AND VOTES AND THAT IS A HEALTHY THING AND UNDERSCORES THIS IS A TOUGH ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO DECIDE. OF THE TWO REPORTS PROBABLY BE EMPLOYMENT REPORT WILL GIVE MORE A SIGNAL OF THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WE WILL GET ANOTHER INFLATION REPORT THAT IS FIRMING UP. THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE, WE ARE CUTTING AS INFLATION IS RISING. I THINK THEY CAN BUT THAT IS NOT A TYPICAL MOMENT FOR THE FED TO CUT. KATIE: ALL EYES ON THE FED AT THE FOMC MEETING NEXT MONTH NOT JUST FOR THE RIGHT DECISION BUT ALSO FOR THE POLITICIZED NATURE OF WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE RIGHT NOW. YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IS UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW IN D.C. THE FED GOVERNOR, LISA COOK, HAS SUED PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER HIS ATTEMPT TO OUST HER FROM HER POSITION. WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH EACH OTHER WHAT IS GOING ON WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESSURE IT IS TRYING TO EXERT ON THE CENTRAL BANK. WHAT STICKS OUT TO ME IS THE APPARENT NON-REACTION WE ARE SEEING IN MARKETS. I KEEP HEARING THAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS WE END UP IN A SITUATION THAT PRESSURES THE LONG AND HIGHER BUT WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT KIND OF STRESS COME THROUGH. CLAUDIA: RIGHT. WE ARE IN UNCHARTERED TERRITORY. IT IS HARD FOR INVESTORS PARTICULARLY MASS INVESTORS TO SEE WHERE THIS CAN GO. THERE IS A LEVEL OF CREATIVITY THAT MAY BE FINANCIAL MARKETS DON'T TYPICALLY ENFORCE OR HAVE. THIS IS A REAL RISK. WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS WEEK, WITH THE FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK, THIS IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF EFFORTS BY THE WHITE HOUSE TO GAIN MORE CONTROL OVER MONETARY POLICY. THEY HAVE BEEN CLEAR WHAT THEY WANT IF THEY GET MORE CONTROL AND THAT IS ULTRA LOW FED FUNDS RATE. AND I THINK AT THIS POINT, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE FED ITSELF, WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE INFLATION RISKS, THE FED THAT IS NO LONGER INDEPENDENT? THAT IS IN THE MIX NOW WHICH IS JUST REALLY SHOCKING. IF CONTROL IS LOST AND INTEREST RATES GO UP VERY LOW, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN INFLATIONARY EPISODE. IF WE GET THERE, I FULLY EXPECT MARKETS TO REACT STRONGLY BUT IT IS A RISK THAT IS OUT THERE AND IT STILL FEELS TO INVESTORS THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IT IS A REAL RISK AND THE RISK IS RISING. BAILEY: IF THAT DOES HAPPEN, WHERE WILL INVESTORS SHIFT THEIR ASSETS TO? CLAUDIA: YES. THIS WILL BE A VERY MESSY ADJUSTMENT IF WE GOT THERE. AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF INFLATION TAKING OFF -- WE SHOULD BUILD IN QUICKLY. BUT AS WITH THE TARIFFS, IT IS NOT LIKE IT SHOWS UP THE NEXT DAY. IT IS A PROCESS. WE COULD HAVE IN THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF IT COULD BE PRETTY SUBTLE IN THE BEGINNING. IT IS MORE THE IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD WOULD POLITICIANS TAKE CONTROL OF MONETARY POLICY DOC ON AVERAGE IT WOULD USUALLY GO TO A BAD PLACE WITH HIGHER INFLATION AND MORE ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE, I DON'T KNOW BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN. BUT LIKE I SAID, IT IS A RISK. WE ARE AT A POINT NOW WHERE IT IS A REAL RISK. BAILEY: A LOT OF RISK TO DIGEST. THANK YOU TO CLAUDIA SAHM, THE CHIEF ECONOMIST TO NEW CENTURY ADVISORS. JAYATI BHARADWAJ IS WITH US. JUST TO START ON THAT, HOW DOES THE ONGOING LISA COOK SAGA IMPACT THE HAVEN STATUS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AND EXPECTATIONS AROUND WHAT THAT COULD MEAN IF WE LOSE A TRULY INDEPENDENT FED? JAYATI: THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF INDICATIONS OF INCREASED INTERFERENCE IN THE WORKINGS OF THE FED. THE QUESTION -- WHY HAVEN'T MARKETS REACTED? I THINK IT IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT WOULD BE -- A LOT OF THE NEW APPOINTEES WHICH TRUMP AND HIS ADVISERS COULD POTENTIALLY GET IN WILL IMPACT THE 2026 FED. FOR NOW WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE SEPTEMBER MEETING. THAT IS WHY MARKET REACTION HAS BEEN RELATIVELY CONTAINED. ON OUR END WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE WORSE CASE. LET'S SAY IF THIS INCREASED INTERFERENCE DOES PROCEED, WE HAVE BEEN BACK TESTING WHAT THAT SCENARIO WOULD MEAN FOR THE DOLLAR AND IT DOESN'T LOOK OPTIMISTIC. KATIE: TALK TO US MORE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKING INVESTORS. HOW DO YOU START TO BLUEPRINT WHERE THIS COULD GO? IN THE CURRENCY MARKET, IS THE DOLLAR STILL A HAVEN IN THAT WORST-CASE SCENARIO? JAYATI: WHEN WE ARE LAYING OUT THE BLUEPRINT FOR WHAT THAT COULD BE, WE ARE ANALYZING TWO SCENARIOS. FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD BE LINKED TO MORE FED CUTS. BUT, WHAT WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING IS THE REACTION OF LONG AND RATES. IT WOULD EITHER BE A WORSE STEEPENING OR A TWIST STEEPENING. BUT BOTH ARE BULLISH DOLLAR. IF INFLATION EXPECTATIONS -- PEOPLE WOULD THINK THE FED HAS TO CUT MORE THAN WHAT IS NEEDED FOR THE ECONOMY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEIR CONCERNS ARE ON A PASS-THROUGH. BOTH ARE BEARISH FOR THE DOLLAR. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING ABOUT A SAFE HAVEN. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN FLAGGING SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR IT. THE DOLLARS HAVEN STATUS IS AT RISK. SOME PEOPLE SAY IT IS A ONE OFF BUT IT HAS BEEN TRUE FOR EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR. THE HATE -- THE SAFE HAVEN STATUS HAS DETERIORATED. BAILEY: I WAS IN JAPAN WHEN WE HAD THE TARIFF CAN TRUMP. THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT SELLING AMERICA. WHERE DO YOU REALLOCATE ASSETS TO IF THE DOLLAR IS NOT A SAFE HAVEN? JAYATI: SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR, THERE HAS BEEN REPATRIATION AND REALLOCATION TOWARDS THE EURO AREA. IN FEBRUARY YOU HAD THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE LOCAL FISCAL PLATFORM. THAT HAS PLATEAUED. YOU ARE SEEING INCREASING SIGNS OF INVESTORS LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN TRUE FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS WHERE THE GAP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS SO WIDE THAT EVERYONE WAS ONLY INVESTING IN THE U.S. I'M NOT SAYING THAT GAP HAS COMPLETELY SHRUNK. THE U.S. STILL HAS A RELATIVE ADVANTAGE OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD. BUT IT HAS SLOWED DOWN WHERE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS STILL HOLDING OUT. THAT HAS ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. EUROPE HAS BEEN THE FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY -- THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN DEVELOPED MARKETS. JAPAN, AUSTRALIA. THEY ALL LOOKED PRIME. JAPAN SAW SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH THE ELECTIONS BUT THAT IS NOW PAST. SIMILARLY WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR THE TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA TO BE ANNOUNCED. THAT WILL BRING CAPITAL ALLOCATION BACK TO ASIA AND EVEN AUSTRALIA. I DO SOMETHING WE SEE PLAYING OUT IN THE NEXT FEW QUARTERS. KATIE: A SIMILAR STORY AND THE EQUITY MARKET. INVESTORS HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUTSIDE THE U.S. OPTION. A EUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS HAVE BEEN ON A TEAR. SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN FX BECAUSE IT IS A ZERO-SUM GAME. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT COULD POSSIBLY REPLACE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THE RESERVE CURRENCY? I STARTED HERE AS A CURRENCY REPORTER IN 2016. THIS WAS AN ARTICLE YOU WROTE ONCE A YEAR. ARE WE SEEING THE END OF THE U.S. DOLLAR BEING THE RESERVE CURRENCY? THE ANSWER WAS ALWAYS NO. THE REASON WHY WAS -- WHAT WAS THE ALTERNATIVE? WHAT COULD TRULY BE THE ALTERNATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WHEN IT COMES TO RESERVE CURRENCY STATUS? YOU LOOK AT THE OPTIONS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS TO POINT BACK TO THE GREENBACK. JAYATI: THAT IS A QUESTION OF THE YEAR AND VERY TOPICAL. WHENEVER PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS LOOK AT THE DOLLARS HOLDINGS AT THE CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD. THAT HAS BEEN SHRINKING AND FALLING LOWER FOR THE LAST DECADE, MORE THAN A DECADE. THAT WAS NEVER THE SIGN OF THE DOLLAR'S OVERVALUATION OR STRENGTH BECAUSE ALWAYS THE STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE OF U.S. ASSETS AND THE MASSIVE INVESTMENT OF THE GLOBAL INVESTORS AND MONEY MANAGERS OF THE WORLD ALL LEANED INTO U.S. EQUITIES. THE DOLLARS OVERVALUATION AND SAFE HAVEN STATUS HAS GONE ONE AND ONE. GOT IS STARTING TO SEE MEANINGFUL CRACKS. -- THAT IS STARTING TO SEE MEANINGFUL CRACKS. EUROPE COMES CLOSE. IT IS NOT A RESOUNDING YES THAT YOU CAN DECLARE THE EURO WILL BE THE NEXT SAFE HAVEN. IT IS THE NEXT PRIME CANDIDATE. YOU WOULD BRING EVERYONE TO A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. MORE THAN IT HAS BEEN. KATIE: GREAT TO GET SOME TIME WITH YOU. THAT WAS JAD BAR IT WASHED, DIRECTOR OF AFFECT STRATEGY AT TD SECURITIES. WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. CHARLIE: WE DO CHECK MARKETS ALL DAY LONG AT A DOWN FRIDAY BUT DESPITE TODAY'S LOSSES, THE S & P 500 IS SET FOR ITS FOURTH STRAIGHT MONTH OF GAINS. EXPECTATIONS REMAIN THAT THE FED WILL CUT RATES TWICE THIS YEAR BEGINNING AS SOON AS SEPTEMBER. TRADITIONALLY A ROCKY MONTH FOR THE EQUITY MARKET. WE HAVE THE S & P 500 INDEX LOWER. TECH LEADING THE WAY DOWN. KEEP IN MIND, THIS TIME YESTERDAY WE HAD THE S & P TRADING ABOVE 6500 AT A RECORD. DOW INDUSTRIAL DOWN .3%. AND NASDAQ DOWN ONE POINT 2%. THE NASDAQ 100 INDEX DOWN 1.3 PERCENT. THE MAG7 INDEX DOWN 1.3 PERCENT. NVIDIA IS DOWN BY 3.7 PERCENT. 10 YEAR, FOUR POINT 22%. 2 YEAR, THREE POINT 61 PERCENT. GOLD IS UP. WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CRUDE DOWN 1%. $63.97 FOR A BARREL OF WTI. BITCOIN, DOWN BY THREE POINT 3%. CATERPILLAR SHARES ARE TRADING LOWER TODAY BY 4.2%. CATERPILLAR IS WARNING INVESTORS IT EXPECTS TERRORISTS TO HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON HIS BUSINESS. CATERPILLAR DOWN BY 4.2 PERCENT. FOR ON-DEMAND NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY SUBSCRIBED TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. I AM CHARLIE PELLETT AND THAT IS A BLOOMBERG BUSINESS FLASH. BAILEY: THANK YOU, CHARLIE. WE ARE FILLING IN FOR CAROL MASSAR AND TIM STENOVEC. A SLOW TRADING SUMMER FRIDAY. VOLUMES ARE DEPRESSED RELATIVE TO WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN BUT THERE IS A LOT GOING ON IN D.C. WE ARE JOINED BY BLOOMBERG NEWS WHITE HOUSE EDITOR, JORDAN FABIAN, JOINING US FROM THE D.C. BUREAU. WE HAD AN EMERGENCY COURT HEARING AROUND THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR, LISA COOK AND THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO FIRE HER. IT LASTED MORE THAN 90 MINUTES BUT THERE WASN'T A RULING. WHAT IS HAPPENING? JORDAN: NO DECISION MADE IN THE HEARING. THE JUDGE BONDS FILINGS BY TUESDAY. AFTER LABOR DAY. PRESUMABLY THEY WOULD WANT A DECISION ON THE JOB STATUS AFTER THAT GIVEN WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF LIMBO. BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND LISA COOK'S ATTORNEYS ARGUED VOCIFEROUSLY ABOUT THE CASE. THEY DID NOT SAY THE VERACITY OF THE ALLEGATIONS MATTERED. YOU HAD LISA COOK'S ATTORNEYS SAYING WHATEVER THE ALLEGATIONS MIGHT BE, THEY OCCURRED BEFORE SHE WAS NOMINATED TO BE ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS THE CAUSE TO REMOVE HER FROM OFFICE. AND YOU HAVE THE GOVERNMENT ARGUING, WELL, DONALD TRUMP CAN DECIDE WHATEVER THE CAUSE IS AND THAT IS NOT UP FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. IN HIS VIEW, A SIMPLE ALLEGATION COULD BE GROUNDS TO FIRE HER AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE COURT TO DECIDE. WE WILL SEE WHAT THE JUDGE HAS TO SAY ABOUT ALL OF THAT. KATIE: WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON SEPTEMBER 17 WHEN WE GET THE NEXT FOMC DECISION. AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WE KNOW LISA COOK IS A VOTING MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKETS COMMITTEE. WILL SHE BE ABLE TO DO HER JOB AT NEXT MONTH'S MEETING? JORDAN: THAT IS A BIG QUESTION. TODAY THEY TALKED ABOUT WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER ON THIS MOVE BY PRESIDENT TRUMP OR WOULD THERE BE CONSIDERATION OF A LONGER INJUNCTION. I THINK THEY TENDED TOWARDS THE LATTER GIVEN THE LONGER INJUNCTION WOULD PROVIDE MORE UNCERTAIN -- MORE CERTAINTY OVER THE COURSE OF THE ONES WHILE THE CASE PLAYS OUT. I THINK THEY WOULD WANT SOME SORT OF DECISION BY THE 17TH GIVEN THE TIMING FOR THE FOMC MEETING. BAILEY: THAT IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. ONE THING THAT ADDS TO THE UNCERTAINTY AS ONGOING CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING IN THE DO YOU -- IN D.C. AND THE IMPACT AROUND THE WORLD. SAMSUNG AND SK HYNIX HAD 120 DAYS ON A HIATUS. IS THIS ANOTHER HEADLINE THAT CAUSES A BIT OF CONFUSION AND UNCERTAINTY BUT STILL HAS QUITE A BIT OF WAYS TO PLAY OUT? JORDAN: I THINK THAT IS RIGHT. THIS WON'T HAVE THE BIGGEST MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANIES GIVEN THEY DON'T HAVE HUGE MANUFACTURING PRESENCES IN CHINA BUT IT IS ANOTHER LEVER FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO USE IN THIS LONGER TRADE BARREL -- TRADE BATTLE THEY HAVE BEEN IN WITH BEIJING. HEAD OF THE TRADE TRUCE THEY WERE RATCHETING UP TARIFFS ON ONE ANOTHER AND IT -- AND IMPOSING EXPORT CONTROLS. SOME WERE LIFTED IN EXCHANGE FOR TARIFF REDUCTIONS. THIS COULD BE THE NEXT POINT OF LEVERAGE FOR THE PRESIDENT AHEAD OF ANOTHER MEETING BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINESE DELEGATIONS. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE BUT THE 90 DAY TRUCE COMES UP IN NOVEMBER. THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT IS ABOUT LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN COMPANIES COMPARED TO FOREIGN COMPETITORS BUT OF COURSE THERE IS GEOPOLITICS AT PLAY AS WELL. JORDAN: ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY BEING THE ARENA WHERE YOU SEE A LOT OF THE TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA PLAYING OUT. YOU HAVE THE STORY TODAY. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH NVIDIA AND THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HE CAN SELL ITS CHIPS IN CHINA AND THE U.S. STAKE IN INTEL. A LOT OF THIS IS BEING FUNNELED THROUGH THE CHIP COMPANIES. JORDAN: A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND FOR GOOD REASON. THE ADMINISTRATION VIEWS THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AS PERHAPS THE CRUCIAL NATIONAL SECURITY RELEVANT INDUSTRY GIVEN THE U.S. AMBITION ON AI AND THE DESIRE TO OUTCOMPETE CHINA IN THAT AREA. THEY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO WALL THAT OFF FROM CHINESE COMPETITION BUT IT IS CREATING UNCERTAINTY. I WILL MENTION THAT IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU MENTIONED, THERE IS THE UPCOMING SEMICONDUCTOR SECTION 232 TARIFF THAT IS YET TO BE ANNOUNCED. TRUMP SAID THERE WOULD BE EXEMPTIONS FOR COMPANIES MANUFACTURING IN THE UNITED STATES BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE. THAT IS MORE UNCERTAINTY ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT THESE EXECUTIVES HAVE TO CONTEND WITH. KATIE: WE APPRECIATE THE UPDATE. JORDAN FABIAN IS A BLOOMBERG NEWS WHITE HOUSE EDITOR BRINGING US THE LATEST FROM D.C. LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THE MARKETS. LOOK AT THE S & P 500, 24 HOURS AGO WE WERE FEELING GREAT AT HIGH TIME HIGHS EVEN WITH NVIDIA LOWER. A DIFFERENT STORY TODAY. SELLING OFF. IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THE DRAW DOWN GIVEN THAT WE DIDN'T GET BAD NEWS ON INFLATION THIS MORNING. BANG IN LINE ACROSS MOST MEASURES. BAILEY: WE ARE STILL IN A MARKET WHERE WE HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH YESTERDAY. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT TRADERS OPERATING AT SKELETON CREWS. TAKE SOME CHIPS OFF THE TABLE. LOOKING AT MOMENTUM AND GROWTH COME UNDER PERFORMING A BIT WHEREAS DIVIDEND AND YIELD OUTPERFORMING. KATIE: AS BAILEY LIPSCHULTZ NOTES, LOOK AT TRADING VOLUME. WE ARE 21% OF THE 30 DAY AVERAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE S & P 500. ONE AREA WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO IS WHAT IS GOING ON WITH SHARES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC. LET'S BRING IN A BLOOMBERG NEWS EQUITY REPORTER. INTERESTING TO SEE SENATE DEMOCRATS INCLUDING ELIZABETH WARREN, CHUCK SCHUMER AND CORY BOOKER TRYING TO PAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO IPO THESE COMPANIES. HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO THEY HAVE IN THIS PROCESS? > > WE KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A VERY CLOSELY WATCHED STORY FOR FANNIE AND FREDDIE WHO WE KNOW WERE TAKEN TO GOVERNMENT CONSERVATORSHIP IN 2008 AFTER THEY WERE TAKING ON TOO MUCH DEBT. RISKIER ASSETS THERE IN PARTICULAR. INTERESTING TODAY, YOU POINTED OUT THE LETTER THAT WE SAW FROM SENATE DEMOCRATS INCLUDING ELIZABETH WARNER, CORY BOOKER AND CHUCK SCHUMER. SENDING A LETTER TO BILL PULTE, THE HEAD OF THOSE THAT OVERSEE FANNIE AND FREDDIE. THEY SAID WE NEED TO HALT THIS IDEA OF PUSHING THESE COMPANIES TOWARD AN IPO AND RETURNING TO PUBLIC MARKETS INSTEAD OF TRADING AS OVER-THE-COUNTER STOCKS. THEY SAY BILL PULTE AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MORE BROADLY SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON DIFFERENT INITIATIVES TO BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF HOUSES IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY SEE -- THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION IS DISTRACTED BY A TAX ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND OTHER THINGS WHEN THEY SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE COULD BE DOING TO WHAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO DO INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME ON AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. BAILEY: THE STOCKS STARTED IN THE RED AT THE OPEN BUT NOW THEY ARE HIGHER. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN YOUR VIEW FOR THE PROJECTION THAT THIS COULD BE AN IPO THAT DOES MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY THIS FALL? > > AS YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU'LL COVER IPO'S CLOSELY, THESE ARE VOLATILE STOCKS. WE SAW THEM EARLIER IN THE RED OFF THE NEWS OF THE LETTER BEING SENT TO BILL PULTE. THEY ARE POPPING INTO THE GREEN NOW. LARGER SCALE, YEAR TO DATE, FANNIE MAE SHARES ARE UP TO 44 PERCENT. FREDDIE MAC UP 192% SO FAR THIS YEAR. WE HAVE SEEN A RALLY OUT THE IDEA THAT AFTER TRUCK WAS ELECTED, WE COULD SEE SOME PROGRESS AS IT RELATES TO TAKING FANNIE AND FREDDIE THROUGH AN IPO. IT TENDS TO BE A VOLATILE TRADE ESPECIALLY WITH SOME HEAVY HEADERS PARTICULARLY BILL ACKMAN ON THE TRADE. BAILEY: WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR SOURCES, BUT IT IS THEIR VIEW ON THE LEGITIMACY OF AN IPO OF FANNIE AND FREDDIE COMBINED? HOW DOES THAT IMPACT THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR THAT YOU COVER CLOSELY? > > THAT IS PART OF WHAT IS GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION. THIS IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THESE WERE COMPANIES THAT USED TO TRADE ON MAJOR EXCHANGE. NOW THEY ARE TRADING UNDER PEAK STREETS HERE. BRINGING THEM BACK TO THE IDEA OF BRINGING THEM IN AS AN IPO, IT IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS. THERE ARE A LOT OF NEEDED INTRICACIES. TRUMP'S APPROVAL WILL BE SUPER ESSENTIAL IN GETTING THIS DONE. PIMCO WAS WARNING THAT A POTENTIAL FANNIE AND FREDDIE IPO COULD LIFT MORTGAGE RATES. THAT HAS BEEN A CONCERN I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY SOURCES MORE BROADLY. KATIE: WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR REPORTING AS WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE STORY. I HAVE TO PUT ON MY MATT MILLER HAT BECAUSE I CAN HEAR HIM IN MY HEAD SAYING, WHY ARE WE CALLING THIS AN IPO? THESE ARE ALREADY LISTED COMPANIES. THIS IS A SECONDARY OFFERING. BAILEY: BUT THEY TRADE OVER-THE-COUNTER. IF THERE WERE TO BE A REAL LISTING OF THESE COMPANIES POTENTIALLY COMBINED, THAT WOULD BE A FIRST TIME SALES SHARER. KATIE: I'M NOT ACTUALLY MATT MILLER SO I WILL ACCEPT THAT EXPLANATION AND SAY IT MAKES PURSE -- IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THE EFFECT ON THE HOUSING MARKET. THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT IF WE SAW THE IPO WE COULD SEE SOME PRESSURE ON MORTGAGE RATES WHICH WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF WHAT I BELIEVE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DO AND THAT IS LOWER THE COST OF HOME OWNERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY. BAILEY: THEY WANT TO DO A LOT TO JUICE THE WHEELS OF GETTING PEOPLE TO BUY AND SELL HOMES. AS A NEW HOME OWNER MYSELF, THE INTEREST RATES ARE EYE-POPPING. THE BIG THING THOUGH IS WHAT DOES THIS MEAN -- IF YOU TAKE THESE COMPANIES PUBLIC, WILL THE BENEFIT OF PUBLICLY OPERATED COMPANIES? CARE ABOUT PROFIT OVER PEOPLE? ? THAT IS A BIG QUESTION ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PUSHING THIS. THE UNCERTAINTY OF HOW THIS COMES TO BE IS TOP OF MIND. KATIE: HOW YOU EXECUTE THIS, THERE ARE A LOT OF URGENT QUESTIONS THERE. COMING UP WE WILL HEAD DOWN TO FLORIDA. THE NATIONAL BANK OF FLORIDA, THE CEO, GEORGE GONZALES JOINS US AND WE WILL ALSO CHECK IN AT ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM WITH TIM STENOVEC AND MOLLY SMITH. ALL OF THAT IS COMING UP. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG \"BUSINESSWEEK .\" \u266a CHARLIE: WE DO CHECK MARKETS ALL DAY LONG HERE AT BLOOMBERG. ONE HOUR AND 20 MINUTES TO GO UNTIL WE WRAP UP THE TRADING MARKET OF AUGUST AND ON THE OFTEN ROCKY MONTH OF SEPTEMBER. STOCKS LOWER ACROSS THE BOARD. TECH SHARES SELLING OFF. THE NASDAQ 100 INDEX, THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX DOWN ONE POINT 2%. THE NASDAQ 100 INDEX DOWN 1.3 PERCENT. KEEPING IT IN CONTEXT TO GO TO THE S & P DOWN 45. YES -- YESTERDAY WE CLOSED ABOVE 6500.

I AM CHARLIE PELLETT AND THAT IS A BLOOMBERG BUSINESS FLASH. BAILEY: THANK YOU, CHARLIE PELLETT. WE ARE FILLING IN FOR CAROL MASSAR AND TIM STENOVEC. ECONOMIC DATA THIS MORNING PAINTED A MIXED PICTURE FOR THE CONSUMER. INFLATION REMAINING STICKY BUT CONSUMERS KEEP SPENDING. TO DISCUSS THAT FROM A STATE LEVEL WE ARE JOINED IN MIAMI BY JORGE GONZALEZ. I ALWAYS FIND THAT BANKS HAVE SOME THE BEST RATES AND UNDERSTAND THE CONSUMER. HIS SPENDING IN FLORIDA CONTINUING STRONG OR ARE PEOPLE DIPPING INTO THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNTS? JORGE: WHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM OUR CLIENTS IS A COMPLETE COMMITMENT TO INVESTMENT IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA FOR THE LONG TERM. WE CONTINUE TO SEE A LOT OF MIGRATION INTO FLORIDA. NEW BUSINESSES TREND UPWARD. SPENDING IS SOMETHING THAT THE CONSUMER CONTINUES TO BE POSITIVE AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT. KATIE: YOU COULD SAY THE SAME ABOUT THE ECONOMIC DATA. INTERESTING TO HEAR THE READ FROM WHERE YOU ARE SITTING. IT IS INTERESTING, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL SECTOR PARTICULARLY THE REGIONAL BANKS, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT CONSOLIDATION. WE HAVE SEEN SOME PICKUP IN M & A BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE THAT SOME WERE CALLING FOR. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD EXPECT IN YOUR FUTURE AS WELL? JORGE: THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA FROM THE BANKING STANDPOINT. IN THE LAST 20 YEARS WE HAVE GONE FROM 300 BANKS TO UNDER 100 AND PROBABLY 80 TODAY. THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SETTLE DOWN AND YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE A LOT MORE M & A ACTIVITY. FOR NOW THOUGH WE HAVE NOT SEEN A LOT. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS. WE HAVE DONE TWO TRANSACTIONS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT MAKE STRATEGIC SENSE. FOR NOW PEOPLE ARE WAITING TO SEE HOW THE SOFT LANDING PLAYS OUT. AND HOW RATES GO BEFORE ANYONE MAKES ANY SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS ON THE M & A FRONT. KATIE: YOU THINK ABOUT FLORIDA AND MIAMI IN PARTICULAR, IT IS HOT. LITERALLY, WHEN IT COMES TO TEMPERATURE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PEOPLE MOVING TO FLORIDA. A LOT OF FOLKS RELOCATING THEIR AS WELL AS COMPANIES. YOU'VE SPOKEN IN PAST EARNINGS CALLS ABOUT THE INCREASED COMPETITION YOU SEE WHEN IT COMES TO DEPOSITS. GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THAT. JORGE: FLORIDA CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMERS. I THINK THERE HAS BEEN OVER -- NEW BUSINESS IS LAUNCHED. THE MAIN DRIVER OF WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST IS IN ADDITION TO A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL COMING INTO FLORIDA, WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DOMESTIC FLOW OF INVESTMENT. IT IS COMING HERE FOR THE LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE. THAT HAS CHANGE THE ECONOMIC FOUNDATION OF FLORIDA FOR THE LONG RUN. FROM THAT STANDPOINT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH CAPITAL FLOWING IN, YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE INCREASED COMPETITION FROM OTHER BANKS. I THINK THE PIE IS BIGGER FOR EVERYONE AND CERTAINLY THE ECONOMY IS SEEKING A NICE RAMP UP AND CREATING A NEW FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE THAT WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT. BAILEY: WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WALL STREET SOUTH. HOW DOES THAT CONTINUE TO PLAY OUT? ARE WE STILL SEE IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE STRONG? JORGE: IT HAS BEEN A PEAK AND VALLEY BUSINESS IN FLORIDA FOR A LONG TIME. BECAUSE OF THE CHANGING FOUNDATION OF THE ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE, I THINK YOU WILL SEE THE PEAKS AND VALLEYS WILL BE MORE SUBDUED. WE ARE SEEING LESS LEVERAGE TO THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ASSET CLASSES TO ACROSS EVERY ASSET CLASS WHETHER IT IS OFFICE, MULTIFAMILY RETAIL, INDUSTRIAL. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS A LONG-TERM CAPITAL BEING DEPLOYED. THERE IS LESS STABILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE. WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH MIGRATION, IT THE PRO BUSINESS GOVERNMENT WE HAVE IN FLORIDA AND THE IMMIGRATION OF CAPITAL FROM -- THE DEPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL FROM INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC SOURCES AND THE IMMIGRATION OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE STABILIZED AT THE REAL ESTATE MARKET ACROSS THE BOARD AND PRICES ARE HOLDING. EVEN THE OFFICE SECTOR WHICH HAS BEEN WEAK ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS PERFORMED RELATIVELY WELL IN FLORIDA, CERTAINLY IN SOUTH FLORIDA. KATIE: I'M CURIOUS TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT A WEAKENED DOLLAR WOULD MEAN FOR YOU. WE WERE HAVING A GREAT CONVERSATION EARLIER WITH OUR GUEST FROM TD SECURITIES AND THEIR HOUSE VIEW IS THAT WE WILL SEE CONTINUED WEAKNESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. I KNOW YOU SEE A LOT OF CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITY FROM WHERE YOU'RE SITTING. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR YOU? JORGE: A WEAKER DOLLAR SPURS MORE INVESTMENT INTO FLORIDA AS ASSETS BECOME MORE -- AS PRICES BECOME MORE OBTAINABLE FOR OUTSIDE INVESTMENT. FROM THAT STANDPOINT I THINK THE WEAK DOLLAR WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FLORIDA ECONOMY. THE OTHER THING TO TALK ABOUT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING RELATIVE TO THE OVERALL GLOBAL VISIBILITY OF THE MARKET AND THE REASON WE ARE SEEING SO MUCH GLOBAL VISIBILITY AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE THE CONVERSATION, WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, SOUTH FLORIDA, THE STATE OF FLORIDA WAS A ONE SPORT STATE AROUND FLORIDA -- AROUND FOOTBALL. IN MIAMI WE HAVE FIVE PROFESSIONAL FRANCHISES. FORMULA ONE GRAND PRIX. THE MIAMI OPEN TENNIS TOURNAMENT. THE FIFA WORLD CUP GENERATING A BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT IN FLORIDA. WE HAVE A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AND THE SUPER BOWL. SPORTS IS BIG BUSINESS AND SPORTS IS A BIG ECONOMIC DRIVER TO OUR ECONOMY. I THINK IT WILL REPRESENT 10% OF OUR GDP FOR 25 OR 26. NOT ONLY IS IT A BIG ECONOMIC DRIVER BUT ALSO TO BRANDING OF THE STATE. WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS, THE COMBINATION BODES WELL FOR CONTINUED GROWTH AND IMMIGRATION. PEOPLE WANT TO BE HERE BECAUSE THEY LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING. FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT, GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT AND THE SPORTS STANDPOINT. BAILEY: YOU HAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI LOGO BEHIND YOU. MIAMI GOES OUT AND GETS CARSON BACK FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. THERE IS A BIG GAME TOMORROW WITH NOTRE DAME COMING TO TOWN. JORGE: THIS IS A BIG FOOTBALL WEEKEND. I LOVE COLLEGE FOOTBALL. WE HAVE THREE BIG GAMES THIS WEEKEND WITH TEXAS, OHIO STATE, CLEMSON AND LSU AND MIAMI AND NOTRE DAME CAPPING OFF THE WEEKEND SUNDAY NIGHT. TWO TOP 10 TEAMS AND A LOT OF HISTORY BETWEEN THOSE FRANCHISES. WE ARE THE OFFICIAL BANK OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI. WE ROCK FOR THE CANES. THIS IS GOOD FOR SPORTS ALL THE WAY AROUND. WE THINK IT IS A KICKOFF TO A GREAT SEASON RELATIVE TO WHAT IS IN STORE FOR US RELATIVE TO ALL OF OUR PROFESSIONAL FRANCHISES. WE DECIDED TO PARTNER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI. THIS IS AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER 100 YEARS. IT IS THE CIVIC PILLAR OF OUR COMMUNITY. AN ECONOMIC DRIVER. WE HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR 80 YEARS. WE HAVE THE SAME CORE VALUES OF GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND SUPPORTING THE NEXT GENERATION OF INNOVATORS AND LEADERS MAKING SURE THIS COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO BE ROBUST RELATIVE TO THE IMPORTANT PILLARS ARE NEEDED TO HAVE A HEALTHY COMMUNITY. WE DECIDED TO BECOME THE OFFICIAL BANK OF THE UNIVERSITY AND SUPPORT NOT JUST THE ATHLETICS BUT ALSO THE HEALTH SYSTEM, THE LAW SCHOOL, THE FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND ALUMNI. IT HAS STARTED OFF TO BE A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE ARE ALSO THE OFFICIAL BANK OF THE ORLANDO MAGIC. AND THAT IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS ONE OF THE MARQUEE BRANDS IN ORLANDO WITH A GREAT FRONT OFFICE AND OWNERSHIP, PLAYERS AND FAN BASE. WE HAVE REALIZED THAT WHEN WE PARTNERED -- WHEN WE PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE U AND THE ORLANDO MAGIC, IT DOES GREAT THINGS FOR OUR BRAND AND VISIBILITY. PARTNERSHIPS ARE THE WAY WE PROVIDE OUR CLIENTS ACCESS TO THINGS THEY CANNOT BUY WITH JUST MONEY. IT IS PROVEN TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS ON BOTH ENDS. KATIE: WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING TIME FOR US AND ENJOY THE GAME. THE SIDEY NATIONAL BANK OF FLORIDA, VICE CHAIRMAN AND CEO. WE ARE KEEPING THE STUDIO WARM BECAUSE TIM STENOVEC AND MOLLY SMITH ARE ON THE GROUND IN THE SHADOW OF ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM AND JOIN US NOW FOR A PREVIEW OF WHAT IS AHEAD FOR THE BLOOMBERG AUDIENCE THIS AFTERNOON AT THE U.S. OPEN. WHAT DO YOU HAVE COMING UP? TIM: WE HAVE A GREAT PROGRAM. DAY NUMBER TWO FOR US AT THE U.S. OPEN AND THE THIRD ROUND FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN. TODAY MOLLY AND I GOT TO SEE SOME TIGHTNESS. WE HAVE TO DO THE PREP WORK IN ORDER TO BE READY FOR THE PROGRAM. THERE WAS A GREAT MATCH, FOUR SETTER. BOTH FRENCH GUYS AND THEY BATTLED IT OUT IN FOUR SETS ON COURT 17. A STRONG BASELINE GAIN FROM BOTH OF THEM WITH INCREDIBLE RALLIES. MOLLY: THAT WAS A GOOD ONE TO WATCH BUT I WAS END OF THE DOUBLES. I WENT TO WATCH THE TOP-SEEDED DOUBLES TEAM ON THE MEN'S SIDE. THAT DRAW STARTED TODAY. THERE WAS A BIG UPSET FOR THE TEAM FEATURING AN AMERICAN GUY. THE CROWD WAS SUPER LOUD. GREAT TO SEE DOUBLES WHICH IS WHAT I PLAY YEAR-ROUND. A LOT OF LESSONS. TIM: MAYBE NEXT YEAR. WE ARE BACK HERE TODAY WITH 70,000 OF OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS AT THE U.S. OPEN AND WE HAVE A GREAT PROGRAM COMING UP. THE CHIEF COMMERCIAL OFFICER AT THE U.S. TENNIS ASSOCIATION WILL JOIN AS. THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF THE U.S. OPEN. WE ARE TALKING EVERYTHING WITH HER FROM HOW THE TOURNAMENT IS DOING TO INCREASING VISIBILITY AND TAKING IT ON THE ROAD PERHAPS AND EXTENDING THE TOURNAMENT. ALL OF THAT AND MORE COMING UP. AND A LITTLE LATER WE WILL MAKE SURE WE STICK WITH EVERYTHING HAPPENING IN MANHATTAN AND IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WITH MIKE MCKEE JOINING US ON EVERYTHING ECO AND EVERYTHING HAPPENING WITH LISA COOK AND THE HEARING TODAY WRAPPING UP WITH NO DECISION AT THIS POINT. WE ARE DOING TENNIS AND ECONOMIC DATA. WE ARE DOING IT ALL FROM THE U.S. OPEN. KATIE: YOU ARE ALSO WATCHING TENNIS. I HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL FRIDAY. TIM STENOVEC AND MOLLY SMITH. YOU CAN CATCH THEM IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES. YOU HAVE TO MOVE OFF BECAUSE COMING UP ON BLOOMBERG TV AT 3:00 YOU WILL BE LIVE WITH SCARLET FU. BAILEY: WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MARKETS UNDERPERFORMING AND A LOT GOING ON IN D.C. AND HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE CELSIUS CEO. KATIE: BE SURE TO DRINK A CELSIUS BEFOREHAND. A LOT MORE TO COVER. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME STOCKS ON THE MOVE. I AM KATIE GREIFELD AND WE ARE JOINED BY KRISTINE AQUINO. WHEN YOU HAVE AN EYE ON? KRISTINE: KRAFT HEINZ -- BREAKING NEWS FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. WE SEE SHARES PICKING UP SOME MOMENTUM. UP 1.2 PERCENT. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED THAT IT IS CLOSING IN ON A PLANNED A BREAK ITSELF UP ACCORDING TO SOURCES. REMEMBER, WE GOT REPORTS EARLIER IN JULY, BLOOMBERG NEWS REPORTED THERE WAS A PLAN BEING PUT IN PLACE TO BREAK UP THE COMPANY. THEY WERE WEIGHING WHETHER JUST BEEN A LARGE PART OF ITS GROCERY BUSINESS INTO A NEW ENTITY. THE LATEST FROM THE JOURNAL IS THAT TRANSACTION COULD BE FINALIZED AND ANNOUNCED AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK. WITH ANY M & A DEAL WE KNOW THAT COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. TIMING COULD STILL BE DIFFERENT. THAT IS THE REPORTING OUT THE MOMENT. INVESTORS SEEMING TO LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOUR TO DATE THEIR SHARE IS DOWN 9%. IT HAS BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME. KATIE: IS AN INTERESTING SPACE. KRAFT HEINZ TRYING TO BREAK THEMSELVES OUT. WE LEARNED OF OTHER DEALS WITH DR PEPPER. COMPANIES BREAKING THEMSELVES APART AND ALSO COMBINING. A LITTLE UPDATE THERE ON WHAT IS GOING ON WITH KRAFT HEINZ. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH SHARES OF DELL THOUGH? KRISTINE: DOWN MORE THAN 9%. EXTENDING DECLINES INTO THE CLOSE BEFORE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. WE GOT THE EARNINGS REPORT. THE LATEST IS THAT THEY AI SERVER ORDERS SLOWED DOWN IN THE SECOND QUARTER. DID SEE $5.6 BILLION FIGURE VERSUS 12.1 BILLION DOLLAR FIGURE EARLIER. -- AMONG ITS PEERS. THEY ONLY REPORTED 8.8%. THE SILVER LINING THOUGH IS THAT IT DID BOOST ITS ANNUAL OUTLOOK AND QUARTERLY SALES AND PROFITS TOPPED ESTIMATES. JP MORGAN TAKING A LOOK AT THE AI SERVER REVENUES. THINKING IF THERE IS A MORE ROBUST OUTLOOK FOR 2026 THAT COULD RAISE EXPECTATIONS FOR GROWTH MEDIUM TERM. KATIE: DOWN 9%. A BRUTAL REACTION FROM AUSTRIA ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THIS IS A COMPANY THAT RAISED ITS ANNUAL SALES PROJECTIONS. THAT IS NOT WHERE THE FOCUS IS TODAY JUDGING BY THEIR SHARES. THAT IS THE STORY WITH DELL. TALK TO US ABOUT CATERPILLAR. KRISTINE: ALSO NOT DOING WELL. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL CLOSE DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE SESSIONS. CATERPILLAR MORNING THAT ALL OF THE TERRORISTS AND THEY SAY TARIFFS WILL COST THEM AS MUCH AS $1.8 BILLION FOR THE FULL YEAR AND THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER ESTIMATING AT 500-6 HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. THAT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A GOOD THING ESPECIALLY FOR A COMPANY THAT WAS ONCE CONSIDERED A BELLWETHER FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. AND BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE SAYING THOUGH THAT THEY ARE STILL OPTIMISTIC THAT EARNINGS WILL BOTTOM THIS YEAR AND THAT THE DRAG FROM TARIFFS IS BIGGER THAN ANTICIPATED PREVIOUSLY. THEY DID REVISE THEIR OUTLOOK -- IT WILL IMPACT OPERATING MARGIN AND THEY DON'T EXPECT THAT TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THEIR RANGE. KATIE: FOR MORE CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS LISTEN TO OUR NEW STOCK MOVERS PODCAST AND SUBSCRIBE TO A FIVE MINUTE EPISODES ON THE BIGGEST WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE STOCK MARKET AND YOU CAN LISTEN TO STOCK MOVERS ON APPLE, SPOTIFY OR ANYWHERE YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. MEANWHILE, OUTSIDE OF THE INDIVIDUAL STOCK LEVEL, BEFORE I LET YOU LEAVE THE STUDIO, TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON TODAY. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE SEEING QUITE A RISK OFF DAY IN MARKETS THOUGH THE INFLATION FIGURES WE GOT THIS MORNING WOULD SUGGEST WE ARE ON TRACK FOR A RATE CUT NEXT MONTH. KRISTINE: THE DATA IS PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE TO OTHER FACTORS IN THE MARKET. THIS WEEK WAS THE WEEK WE GOT BIG RESULTS. THAT WAS ONE MAIN EVENT FOR MARKETS. SOME DISAPPOINTMENT THERE OVER THE PACE OF GROWTH. IT SEEMS THE REALITY CHECK. IT GAVE -- GIVEN TO A LOT OF INVESTORS. THE AI BOOM IS STARTING TO SLOW ENTERING MORE MATURE STAGES AND THAT HIT NVIDIA AND A BIG CHUNK OF TEXT STOCK. AND TAKING US INTO QUITE A DOUR FINISH INTO THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. KATIE: IT DOES LOOK LIKE WE WILL CLOSE AUGUST WITH GAINS BUT AN UGLY FINISH. A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN AN HOUR WITH THE MONTH AND WINDOW DRESSINGS. THAT IS KRISTINE AQUINO, MANAGING EDITOR FOR OUR MARKETS LIVE BLOG. BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK DAILY CONTINUES LIVE FROM THE U.S. OPEN WITH TIM STENOVEC AND MOLLY SMITH.
