  "title": "iOS 26 has political groups panicking over fundraising. The truth might surprise them",
  "description": "I spoke to Apple to find out how the 'new' iOS 26 'Screen Unknown Senders' text message filter actually works.",
  "content": "Last week, Punchbowl News published an internal memo the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) sent to its members, warning that Apple\u2019s upcoming iOS 26 operating system for the iPhone could cost the organization $25 million in donations. The NRSC is the Republicans\u2019 primary Senatorial fundraising arm. The memo further said the changes could cost the greater GOP half a billion dollars in lost political donations.\n\nThe change? A new \u201caggressive message filtering\u201d feature, according to the NRSC memo, that Apple is introducing in iOS 26\u2019s Messages app, which handles both iMessages and regular SMS text messages. This feature will filter texts from unknown senders\u2014like the kind the NRSC sends out to phones across the country to raise political donations\u2014into a siloed inbox where the iPhone user won\u2019t see or be notified of the message.\n\nThe thing is, this \u201caggressive message filtering\u201d feature is nothing new in iOS, and the changes Apple is making to it in iOS 26 actually benefit both the iPhone user and, potentially, the sender of the message themself. Still, given the confusion surrounding it, I decided to go to the source\u2014Apple\u2014to see how the feature in iOS 26 actually works.\n\nThe \u2018new\u2019 iOS 26 \u2018unknown senders\u2019 filter has existed since iOS 13\n\nThe supposedly new \u201cunknown senders\u201d filter in iOS 26, which has the NRSC so concerned, actually exists on all iPhones running iOS 18 today. Apple confirmed to me that the feature has existed in a similar form on all iPhones going back to iOS 13, which first shipped in 2019.",
