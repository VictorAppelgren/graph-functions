  "description": "Ibotta Inc (IBTA) focuses on strategic transformation and client engagement despite short-term revenue challenges.",
  "content": "For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\u2022 Ibotta Inc (NYSE:IBTA) is undergoing a significant business transformation to capture a larger share of the CPG marketing spend.\n\u2022 The company has introduced a new performance marketing model that has received positive feedback from clients.\n\u2022 Ibotta Inc (NYSE:IBTA) has gained access to higher-level decision-makers within key clients, indicating stronger client relationships.\n\u2022 The company has received third-party validation for its new measurement methodology, enhancing credibility.\n\u2022 Ibotta Inc (NYSE:IBTA) is reorganizing its sales department to improve sales execution and client engagement.\n\u2022 Revenue and adjusted EBITA were below the guidance range provided in the previous quarter.\n\u2022 The company is facing short-term headwinds due to its ongoing business transformation.\n\u2022 Two initial pilot partners decided not to run additional campaigns, impacting financial performance.\n\u2022 There is a significant lag in scaling up new performance marketing clients, affecting revenue growth.\n\u2022 The reorganization of the sales department has caused turnover and disruption in sales execution.\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the rollout of CPI and the results from the third-party data provider? How do the new pilots compare to earlier ones? A: Brian Lee, CEO: The breakthrough with CPI is measuring the difference between exposed and unexposed audiences in real-time, a first for the promotions industry. Third-party studies show our campaigns deliver significant incremental sales, often better than our own conservative estimates. The new pilots include both smaller, agile companies and large CPG firms, with conversations now reaching higher-level decision-makers unfamiliar with Ibotta. This indicates a promising expansion of our capabilities.\n\nQ: What are the key strategic elements needed to execute your plan for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026? A: Brian Lee, CEO: We need to consolidate our sales execution benefits, fill unfilled positions, and train staff on new approaches. Implementing our new go-to-market strategy is crucial, and we need to resolve product and tool challenges to automate processes. Aligning these efforts with client budget cycles, which vary, is essential for scaling our initiatives.\n\nQ: How are your original partnerships, like with Walmart, performing? A: Brian Lee, CEO: Our collaboration with Walmart is strong, with increased efforts to raise awareness and reduce friction in using our digital offers. Walmart is integrating our offers more deeply into their customer interactions, which is driving loyalty and adoption. Overall, our publisher partnerships are a bright spot, contributing to our redeemer base growth.",
