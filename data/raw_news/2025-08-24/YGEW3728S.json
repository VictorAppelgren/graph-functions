  "title": "I reviewed the Honor Magic V Flip 2 Jimmy Choo flip phone. It\u2019s flipping fantastic but needs a global release",
  "description": "Move over Samsung and Motorola, there's a new flip phone sheriff in town. Meet the Jimmy Choo-inspired Honor Magic V Flip 2, which offers a large 200MP camera, the biggest battery and the fastest charging on a flip phone. It's so good, there's only one problem: its availability.",
  "content": "If you had told me that I would like a Jimmy Choo-inspired flip phone over the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 or the Galaxy Z Flip 7, I would have laughed in disbelief. Having spent a week with Honor\u2019s new Magic V Flip 2 flip phone, complete with its gorgeous Jimmy Choo branding, I\u2019m glad that I was completely wrong.\n\nIt would be easy to judge the Magic V Flip 2 just by its celebrity branding, but this is just the icing on the proverbial cake. Honor\u2019s second-generation Flip phone addresses many of the challenges with flip phones, and it proves that flip phones don\u2019t require compromises. The 200MP main camera, 50MP ultrawide camera, large 5,500 mAh battery, and 80W charging all prove this to be true.\n\nThere\u2019s just one key issue: it\u2019s not launching outside of China, at least not right now. It\u2019s rumored to launch globally later, and that\u2019s a good thing: Honor\u2019s new flip phone is so good that it deserves a global launch. It almost certainly won\u2019t launch in the US, but if it launches in other Honor global markets like the UK, it will pose a big challenge to the best from Samsung and Motorola.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s the best flip phone that you can\u2019t buy, which is a shame: aside from a few small areas, it\u2019s the best flip phone you can\u2019t buy right now.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the full Honor Magic V Flip 2 specs sheet, and how it compares to the key competition.\n\nThere are two main reasons to buy the Honor Magic V Flip 2, and it excels in both of these areas: the camera and the battery life.\n\nAs you\u2019ll see from my video capturing my best friend\u2019s wedding, the camera system is incredibly versatile, and it is the closest we\u2019ve come to a flagship camera system on a flip phone. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 boasts an excellent 50MP shooter setup, but the 200MP main camera on the Honor Magic V Flip 2 surpasses it.\n\nThe ultrawide lens is a particular highlight, with the saturation hues that we\u2019ve come to associate with Samsung cameras. Images are color-rich, detailed, and vibrant, although there can be a delay in processing images when you capture multiple photos in a row.\n\nOne particularly interesting feature on the Honor Magic V Flip 2 is the new super zoom feature, which offers up to 30X zoom despite the lack of a telephoto lens. Using the same AI tricks as other phones, the Honor Magic V Flip 2 delivers the best zoom performance on a flip phone to date. It won\u2019t compete against the best camera phones like the Pixel 10 Pro and Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it proves that flip phones can have an effective telephoto setup without needing a third lens.\n\nLike every other flip phone, you can easily take selfies using the front display and the main cameras, and given the camera is second-to-none, this is my favorite flip phone for taking selfies. Video recording could be improved when using the rear cameras and the front display, and there\u2019s occasional blur where the phone took too long to process the image, but these are some gripes with an otherwise fantastic smartphone camera. If I had another wedding to attend, I would take the Honor Magic V Flip 2 with me.\n\nThe battery life and charging are also superb\n\nThe 5,500 mAh battery in the Honor Magic V Flip 2 is larger than many of the best phones, and the battery life shows. Over the past two weeks with the Honor\u2019s new flip phone, one thing has become clear: the Honor Magic V Flip 2 sets new benchmarks in battery life and charging for flip phones.\n\nDuring my friend\u2019s wedding, it lasted almost 40 hours on a single charge with between five and six hours of screen time. Honor\u2019s battery graph resets at midnight, making it challenging to collect exact data. However, battery life has proven to be better than my experiences with the Galaxy Z Flip 7. The Razr Ultra 2025 is much closer, but Honor has a slight upper hand, which is further extended when you use the main display over the cover display.\n\nThen there\u2019s the charging, and Honor has also set a new benchmark here. The Honor Magic V Flip 2 supports 80W wired charging, which Honor claims can charge the phone to full in just 42 minutes. In my testing, it takes a few minutes longer, but it\u2019s still easily the fastest charging flip phone on the market.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just limited to the wired charging, as the Honor Magic V Flip 2 also features 50W wireless charging, which is much faster than the 30W charging offered by the Razr Ultra 2025 and the 15W wireless charging in the Galaxy Z Flip 7. If you\u2019re looking for a flip phone with battery life comparable to the best phones, the Honor Magic V Flip 2 is the perfect choice.\n\nHow the Honor Magic V Flip 2 could be better\n\nThere are two areas in which the Honor Magic V Flip 2 could be better, but even in these areas, Honor deserves commendation for what the Magic V Flip 2 offers out of the box.\n\nFirst, there are Google services, and as you may have guessed, the Honor Magic V Flip 2 doesn\u2019t ship with Google services enabled out of the box. Yet, despite this being a Chinese device with a Chinese ROM, you can easily enable Google services with one tap in the settings menu. The only impact is that it\u2019s harder to transfer from another phone during the setup, although again, Honor has a solution in its Honor Clone app.\n\nWhere this does start to be frustrating is if you use Gemini or other Google apps and services. They all work, except for some apps like eBay, which aren\u2019t supported and can\u2019t be installed. However, there\u2019s no easy way to launch Gemini. By default, the YOYO assistant launches when you press and hold the power button, and there\u2019s no way to set this to Gemini, nor does the voice command work to launch Google\u2019s next-generation assistant. This is likely because the software is designed for the Chinese market, where Google services aren\u2019t available, and any global launch would likely have Gemini and Google apps working as with any other Android phone.\n\nThen there is the front display, and the Honor Magic V Flip 2 takes a different approach. Despite a full-screen 4-inch display, it\u2019s designed to be split and display menus or apps on the right-hand side, with a smaller banner featuring a clock on the left. This makes apps and menus appear vertical, like they would on a regular phone, although the scaled-down size can make it challenging to read text in an app.\n\nThere\u2019s also the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, which is now two years old, and the lack of guaranteed future Android updates. The processor is somewhat of a disappointment, but I\u2019ve yet to experience any noticeable lag. However, its age does mean it won\u2019t run on-device AI as well as the competition, nor will it be as good for gaming. These downsides aside, there are a ton of reasons to like the Honor Magic V Flip 2.\n\nOn paper, the Honor Magic V Flip 2 has the upper hand compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Moto Razr Ultra 2025, although both of those phones have a couple of key advantages.\n\nHonor\u2019s folding phone boasts a superior camera compared to its competitors, along with better battery life and faster charging. The front display isn\u2019t as functional as Motorola\u2019s, but it is better out of the box than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. In the box, the Honor Magic V Flip 2 comes with an 80W charging brick and a matching protective case, while neither of the competition includes either of these.\n\nWhere the Razr Ultra 2025 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 excel is their global availability; the Honor Magic V Flip 2 is exclusive to China right now, and its CNY 5,499 price tag makes it far cheaper than the competition when converted, although any eventual global price will be much higher. That said, if you can easily buy any of these three, I\u2019d have no hesitation in recommending the Honor Magic V Flip 2\n\nAside from a few areas of improvement, the Honor Magic V Flip 2 is everything I want in a folding phone. The Jimmy Choo Dreamwaver edition is particularly unique, and the rest of the specs sheet is absolutely fantastic. In fact, the entire Honor Magic V Flip 2 experience is excellent.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a challenge to acquire, and it won\u2019t be as accessible or affordable as the competition, thanks to the Best Razr Ultra deals and the best Galaxy Flip 7 deals. Yet, it works fairly well on US-carriers \u2014 although it is missing mmWave and some choice bands \u2014 and despite some software areas, it works just as well as a global phone.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to, but it turns out that I love the Honor Magic V Flip 2. I hope that Honor brings this to as many global markets as possible.",

      "text": "We\u2019ve already been told the upcoming Honor Magic V5 will be the world\u2019s thinnest foldable phone, and now we have the measurement to prove it.\nThe Honor Magic V5 will measure 8.8mm folded (via Bloomberg), making it 0.1mm thinner than the current world\u2019s thinnest foldable, the Oppo Find N5, and 0.4mm thinner than the handset it\u2019s replacing \u2013 the Magic V3 (Honor is skipping \u20184\u2019 and moving straight to \u20185\u2019).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that measurement doesn\u2019t include the phone\u2019s camera bump. Still, it means the Magic V5 isn\u2019t that much thicker than Galaxy S25 Ultra (8.2mm) and iPhone 16 Pro Max (8.3mm) \u2013 neither of which are foldable phones. The V5 should be a foldable you can slip comfortably into a pocket without it feeling excessive.\nHonor will officially launch the Magic V5 on July 2 in China, but it might face immediate competition from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (and Z Flip 7), with reports suggesting its introduction is just weeks away.\nHowever, Honor is confident it won\u2019t be beaten for thinness, saying \u201cwhile Samsung has been hinting at a thinner Galaxy Z Fold 7, the Magic V5 is expected to retain its title as the world\u2019s thinnest foldable device throughout 2025.\u201d\nWill Samsung come close?\nSamsung has also been teasing its next foldable, claiming \u201cthe newest Galaxy Z series is the thinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet\u201d \u2013 although according to Honor it\u2019s not going to be slimmer than 8.8mm (when folded).\nThis does tally with rumors dating back to February, when an Android Headlines report suggested the Z Fold 7 would measure 9.5mm folded and 4.5mm when unfolded. It could be even slimmer though, with a SamMobile report from May suggesting the Z Fold 7 would be 9mm folded, 4.54mm unfolded.\nIf accurate, those figures are a major improvement over the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which is 12.1mm folded and 5.6mm unfolded, yet the Z Fold 7 would still be thicker than the Magic V5 and the Find N5.\nWe\u2019ve also been given our first look of the V5 in person \u2013 check out our initial snaps of the phone on Instagram."

      "text": "Summer is fast approaching, and that means it won\u2019t be long before we see Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Z Flip 7 make its debut. While the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a top-notch foldable, it also felt like Samsung phoned it in last year.\nIt offered mostly modest improvements over the Z Flip 5, with the most significant ones being hidden under the hood, like thermal improvements, or generally underwhelming, like a larger cover screen that didn\u2019t improve in any other meaningful way.\nWe\u2019re hoping that Samsung does better with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 this year. The good news is that plenty of leaks and rumors suggest the company is on the right track to hit it out of the park in its seventh inning. Let\u2019s dig in and go over everything we\u2019ve heard so far about what to expect from Samsung\u2019s flagship flip phone this year.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Latest news\n- June 23: Samsung confirms its next launch event is set for July 9\n- June 18: Reliable leaker Evan Blass says the Z Flip 7 launch date is July 9\n- June 11: Samsung confirms AI-powered cameras for its next foldable phone\n- June 9: Samsung confirms its new Galaxy Fold series is its \u201cthinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet\u201d\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Release date and pricing\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 launch date is set to be July 9, after Samsung confirmed a mobile-focused launch event for that day. That\u2019s the date which had been previously leaked by reliable tipster Evan Blass.\nWhile Samsung\u2019s summer Galaxy Unpacked events were typically held in August, the company switched things up in 2023 by moving to July 26 for the Galaxy Z Flip 5 reveal. That continued into 2024, when Samsung went even earlier, with a July 10 event in Paris to unveil the Galaxy Z Flip 6.\nFor 2025, Samsung is descending on Brooklyn, New York to announce its next foldable handsets. The event kicks off at 7am PDT / 10am PDT, and will be livestreamed on its website and YouTube channel.\nAs for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 price, the Z Flip 6 got a $100 price bump last year, raising the starting price to $1,099. This makes it more likely that Samsung will hold the line on pricing for this year\u2019s models, which are expected to be available in the same 256GB and 512GB capacities for $1,099 and $1,219, respectively.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Design\nWe\u2019re not expecting any radical changes in the overall design of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 this year compared to its predecessor. Samsung generally takes a more iterative approach to the design of its foldables, refining the design each year with modest style and usability enhancements rather than making broader changes.\nSome rumors have suggested that Samsung could move away from the softer, rounded edges of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and prior models, adopting a \u201cboxier\u201d aesthetic this year.\nThe theory is that this might be needed to accommodate new displays and a larger batter without compromising its slimness. However, most of the leaked renders we\u2019ve seen indicate that if any such changes occur, they\u2019re likely to be subtle. All the renders we\u2019ve seen suggest that the button placement will remain the same.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 may grow slightly taller and wider \u2014 some leaks have suggested dimensions of 166.6 x 75.2 x 6.9mm, compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which comes in at 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm, but other renders are barely distinguishable from the current model.\nUnconfirmed rumors point to the possibility of a titanium build, but we\u2019d take those with a grain of salt, as Samsung has thus far reserved that material for its top-of-the-line Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nSamsung made some significant improvements to the hinge on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 last year, featuring a new \u201cdual rail hinge\u201d design that offers better shock distribution and moves more fluidly than ever while being rigid enough to let you prop the phone up at any angle.\nSamsung says that the Z Flip 6 hinge is rated for 200,000 folding and unfolding cycles. We were impressed with what Samsung did here, but it may not be finished if the rumors are accurate. The company has repeatedly said it\u2019s focused on improving its hinges\u2019 long-term reliability and durability as much as possible, and several sources suggest some of those improvements could arrive in this year\u2019s model.\nIt\u2019s an open question how much practical difference this will make in everyday use, but it could ensure that Galaxy Z Flip 7 owners can continue enjoying a solid and reliable hinge mechanism even if they hold onto their phone for several years. Sadly, there\u2019s been little reporting on whether an improved hinge might also improve dust resistance.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 has an IP48 rating, which provides excellent water protection, but falls short on dust resistance compared to premium non-foldables, which typically carry an IP68 rating. The lower score for dust resistance is mainly due to the hinge and the flexible inner display, and there\u2019s only so much Samsung can do here. Beach sand won\u2019t be a problem \u2014 IP48 is enough to protect against particles larger than 1mm \u2014 but fine dust may remain an issue.\nThere\u2019s been no word yet on what colors we can expect the Galaxy Z Flip 7 to arrive in. Samsung typically has some pretty fun shades for its Z Flip series, and we expect that will continue. However, what we\u2019d really like to see is a return of the Bespoke Edition initiative that Samsung from the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 4 era.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Displays\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is slated to get some very nice display improvements this year, both inside and out.\nReliable sources, including display analyst Ross Young, believe the main foldable display will grow from the 6.7-inch size that\u2019s been the norm for the past few years to an even larger 6.8-inch or 6.85-inch screen. While the width and height may increase to make room for this larger screen, Samsung is also expected to reduce the bezels.\nSamsung\u2019s display division showed off some impressive creaseless screen technology at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress (MWC), rivaling what we\u2019ve seen in the Oppo Find N5. This has made some hopeful that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 could finally rival what OnePlus, Oppo, and Honor have already managed to pull off. Sadly, we\u2019re not holding our breath on this one, as it\u2019s probably too early for Samsung\u2019s bleeding-edge screen tech to be ready for this year\u2019s model. Multiple reports say Samsung will noticeably reduce the crease in this year\u2019s model, which is still good news, but it may not go away entirely until the Galaxy Z Flip 8 comes around next year.\nMeanwhile, the cover screen is rumored to become both larger and more functional. Most reports agree on a 4-inch display \u2014 a healthy increase from the 3.4-inch one of the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Some reports call it a \u201cfull-sized\u201d or \u201cfull-width\u201d screen, suggesting it could cover most of the front. Again, some of this increase will come from slimmer bezels. There\u2019s a preponderance of evidence for this new cover screen, including comments from Young, leaked CAD renders, and images of early Z Flip 7 case designs.\nSeveral sources suggest Samsung\u2019s goal is to finally make the cover screen fully functional. Previous Galaxy Z Flip models limited the cover screen mostly to notifications, quick settings, and widgets. Even when the display went from 1.9 to 3.4 inches on last year\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung did little to improve the experience \u2014 it just made it bigger. The 720 x 748 resolution and 60Hz display made everything look sluggish and fuzzy, and you still couldn\u2019t run apps on it without fiddling with settings and third-party tools.\nWe\u2019re hoping that Samsung has listened to user feedback and taken a cue from the Motorola Razr Plus, which has a cover screen that leaves Samsung in the dust; a 4-inch display that\u2019s just as limited as the current 3.4-inch one would be a major disappointment. Based on everything we\u2019ve heard, the outlook is good, but we won\u2019t know for sure until Samsung unveils this year\u2019s foldables.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Camera\nWhile the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to take a nice leap forward in screen technology, it doesn\u2019t look like Samsung will do the same for its camera system. By all reports, this year\u2019s model will feature identical camera specs to the Galaxy Z Flip 6: a dual-camera array with a 50-megapixel (MP) primary wide lens and a 12MP ultra-wide, joined by a 10MP selfie camera under the main display.\nSome of those cameras may gain new sensors under the hood for better light sensitivity and color reproduction, but most of the camera improvements will likely come from a more powerful image signal processor (ISP) inside this year\u2019s model and the AI computational photography improvements from a more advanced neural processing unit (NPU).\nAlong those lines, Samsung may introduce more AI-driven features for editing and optimizing photos, further expanding its Galaxy AI Suite like it did for the Galaxy S25 lineup earlier this year. However, most of those also came to older Galaxy S-series and Z-series phones, so they may not be unique to the Galaxy Z Flip 7.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Specs\nThere\u2019s been a running debate among analysts and leakers about whether this year\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip 7 will pack in Qualcomm\u2019s custom Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy or Samsung\u2019s own flagship Exynos 2500 chip. Early speculation pointed to the Exynos, but Samsung has reportedly been having production problems in producing enough chips to meet expected demand.\nThis is the same issue that reportedly led to Samsung scrapping its Exynos plans for the global Galaxy S25 models and going all-in on the Snapdragon 8 Elite. While there\u2019s still evidence that the Exynos 2500 could be used in the rumored Galaxy Z Flip FE, it\u2019s looking more likely that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will follow the S25 lineup and go exclusively with Qualcomm chips, at least for its first run. North American models will likely use the Snapdragon 8 Elite either way, as Samsung hasn\u2019t used Exynos chips in any of its flagships sold in the U.S. since 2015 and in Canada since 2016.\nMemory and storage specs are likely to remain unchanged this year. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 was available in 256GB and 512GB storage capacities, both with 12GB of RAM, and all rumors point to the same for the Z Flip 7, so don\u2019t hold your breath for a 1TB model.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Battery and charging\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 could see a modest battery size increase, with reports pointing to a 4,300mAh cell \u2014 a 7.5% bump from the 4,000mAh battery in the Galaxy Z Flip 6. However, the real battery life improvements will likely come from other efficiency improvements, both technical and practical.\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite chip has already proven itself a winner in battery efficiency, and several rumors suggest that the new displays will adopt a more power-efficient Color Filter on Encapsulation (CoE) technology, or what Samsung Display calls Eco\u00b2OLED. This first came to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and has been refined on subsequent Z Fold models. There have also been rumors it could appear on next year\u2019s Galaxy S26 Ultra.\nPotential cover screen usability improvements will also offer a more practical way of increasing battery life. Since a four-inch panel draws less power than a 6.85-inch screen, the more you can do with the phone closed, the longer the battery will last. Most Galaxy Z Flip users find themselves flipping their phones open several times a day, even just to read an email or text message. If our experience with Motorola\u2019s recent flip phones is any indication, we expect Galaxy Z Flip 7 users will need to do this far less often.\nLeaks from early prototype testing indicate that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could run for nearly an hour longer on a single charge despite having the same battery as its predecessor. This makes us optimistic that we can expect comparable improvements for the Galaxy Z Flip 7.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s some bad news on the charging front: According to information from China\u2019s 3C certification database, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to retain the same paltry 25W wired charging speeds as its predecessors. That\u2019s disappointing but not altogether surprising; Samsung tends to take a conservative approach to charging speeds. The specific reasons for this aren\u2019t entirely clear, but it helps reduce excessive heat in a cramped folding design and ensures the battery stays healthier in the long term.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Software and features\nIn a surprising twist, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 could be one of the first Samsung phones to launch with One UI 8. That\u2019s thanks to Google releasing Android 16 earlier than usual this year, with the next major release expected to land in June.\nThis means that Android 16 will be out by the time the Galaxy Z Flip 7 launches. It\u2019s unlikely Samsung wants to be left behind, so it\u2019s reportedly been hustling to have One UI 8 ready to go in time to take advantage of all the latest Android enhancements.\nIn addition to upgraded health tracking features, Audio Sharing, and enhanced anti-theft protections, Android 16 offers a native Desktop mode for the first time, allowing users to project a Chrome OS-like interface onto a larger screen. This has led to speculation that Samsung might include DeX support on the Z Flip 7 to provide its own desktop computing experience rather than simply relying on what Android 16 offers.\nSome have even suggested that DeX could work with Samsung\u2019s Flex Mode, allowing it to be used as a dedicated webcam for video calls on a larger screen. Nevertheless, these rumors remain speculative, and it\u2019s equally possible that Samsung may choose to retire DeX in favor of Android\u2019s more standard desktop mode.\nBeyond the Android 16 features that One UI 8 will embrace, it\u2019s a safe bet that we can also expect to see some new Galaxy AI features show up. There\u2019s been no word on what these might be, and much of what Samsung has offered so far has leaned more toward the gimmicky. Most of the really useful ones, like Circle to Search, Magic Editor, and Gemini Live, come from Google, not Samsung."

      "text": "\u201cThe combination of a great design, solid performance, decent camera results and great battery life (with speedy charging) make the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 the flip phone to beat for this year.\u201d\n- Fantastic (and useful) external display\n- Lovely and bright internal display\n- Reduced crease visibility\n- Solid camera performance\n- Speedy charging\n- Decent battery life\n- Excellent build quality\n- Unique finish options\n- Smooth and slick performance\n- Only three years of Android OS updates\n- Moto AI still needs work\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nThe Razr Ultra 2025 sits at the top of Motorola\u2019s three-strong line up of flip phones for this year, above the Razr 2025 and Razr Plus 2025. At first glance, it looks almost identical to the Razr Plus 2024 that it succeeds but look a little deeper and there are some significant changes that put this flip phone in the running to be one of the best foldable phones available.\nI\u2019ve been using the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 since it was announced in New York on April 24 and here\u2019s why it\u2019s worth your attention, and why it will garner the attention of everyone else around you too.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025: design\nTake one look at the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking it was the Razr Plus 2024. On the surface, there\u2019s very little to differentiate these two devices unless you really know your season\u2019s colors, but that\u2019s not a criticism. The Razr Plus 2024 was a fantastic flip phone in terms of design and the same can certainly be said for Razr Ultra 2025.\nThe Pantone Scarab model is my personal favorite of the Razr Ultra 2025\u2019s four available finishes, featuring Alcantara\u2019s signature soft, suede-like material in a deep green, but my review model was the Pantone Mountain Trail and a wood-effect finish on a phone is certainly different, and I mean that in a good way.\nIt\u2019s smooth to the touch so don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not going to give you splinters, but there\u2019s a good amount of texture too, which goes along way in reducing the slipperiness you get on glass finishes of other flagship phones.\nThe flat edges of the Razr Ultra 2025 have a slight curve too, meeting somewhere in the middle between the current trend for the flat edges we see on the likes the Galaxy S25 and the iPhone 16, and the comfort of rounder devices from the past. Those edges, which are 7.2mm when open and 15.7mm when closed, make the Razr Ultra 2025 very comfortable in the hand, while the overall finish of the aluminium frame is exceptionally premium and solid in its build quality.\nAs with all flip phones, the Razr Ultra 2025 draws plenty of attention. Put it down on a restaurant table and envious eyes gaze longingly at it, because despite modern flip phones having been around since 2020, they still aren\u2019t as common place as the latest iPhone or Galaxy phone.\nThe large external display on the front \u2013 more on that in a second \u2013 makes good use of the space available with the two camera lenses positioned in the bottom right corner again, while open the Razr Ultra 2025 up and you\u2019re greeted with a larger internal display than before.\nOn the right edge, there\u2019s the power button with a fingerprint sensor built in, and the volume buttons can be found here too. The left edge meanwhile, has a new button for Moto AI \u2013 again, I\u2019ll talk more about that in a minute \u2013 but this is one area of the design you would be able to circle in a game of spot the difference between this year\u2019s model and the Razr Plus 2024.\nAnother area would be the hinge because despite looking the same as the Razr Plus 2024, it has been redesigned, adding titanium into the mix for reinforcement, whilst also allowing the Razr Ultra 2025 to be IP48 dust and water resistant, which is a jump up from the IPX8 rating of the Razr Plus 2024.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025: displays\nMotorola has made some key improvements to the Razr Ultra 2025\u2019s displays too. I\u2019ll start with the external display as while the size remains the same as the Razr Plus 2024 at 4 inches, the brightness has increased from 2,400 nits to 3,000 nits and there\u2019s Gorilla Glass Ceramic protection too. There\u2019s no anti-reflective coating so it\u2019s basically a mirror when off and it really likes a fingerprint too, but the bump in brightness does a great job of cutting through sunny days.\nIt\u2019s pretty much a fully functioning display too. While the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\u2019s external display is reserved primarily for quick settings, widgets and notifications, the Razr Ultra 2025 allows you to run most apps without requiring third-party software or fiddling with special settings, from WhatsApp and Spotify to highly addictive games like Marble Mayhem and Catch Moto Moo. Naturally, you can also see notifications, as you would expect, and there are plenty of customisation options for widgets and apps too.\nReplying to messages on the external display is a little fiddly in that the keyboard takes up most of the display, whether you use the full screen editor or not, but the point is it\u2019s possible without flipping the phone open. The calendar and weather screens lend themselves perfectly to the small, square format too, as do some of the games, and even viewing photos is a good experience for a quick glance. Everything on the external display looks sharp and detailed, there are good viewing angles and there\u2019s plenty of punch from the colors too.\nFlip the Razr Ultra 2025 open and the 7-inch pOLED display is gorgeous. You can fiddle with the display settings to suit your preferences, with a choice of Natural, Radiant and Vivid styles, plus the ability to switch between Default, Warm, Cool and Custom tones so you really can get the display to work for you and what you like. I personally liked Natural, which I still thought delivered bright and vibrant colors without being overly saturated, but you do you.\nBoth the internal and external displays are \u201cPantone-Validated\u201d, though I\u2019m not sure how many people will be particularly bothered by that. At the end of the day, you just want a display to look good, and in the Razr Ultra 2025\u2019s case, everything looks great from streaming video on Netflix to your family photos.\nThere\u2019s a 165Hz refresh rate too, which delivers a smooth experience whatever you\u2019re doing, the 2,912 x 1,224 pixel resolution offers sharp detail and the 4,500 nits peak brightness makes sure this is a phone you can use on the sun lounger without an issue. Viewing angles aren\u2019t as good as the iPhone 16 Pro, with whites losing their brightness as you move the Razr Ultra 2025 to a certain angle, but you won\u2019t do that very often so it will make little difference to your overall experience.\nWhat can make a difference to your experience with flip phones is the crease in the display and while still not invisible here, Motorola has done a superb job of reducing it. There is still some distortion when reading large amounts of text, and you can see it at certain angles too, as well as feel it when you run your thumb over it, but it\u2019s less obvious than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, resulting in a folding internal display that\u2019s one of the best out there.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025: camera\nThe Motorola Razr has a triple camera setup, with dual 50-megapixel sensors on the front, effectively making up the rear cameras when the device is open, and a third 50-megapixel sensor at the top of the internal display. In what might be considered a slightly strange move from Motorola, the company switched the telephoto sensor that was on the Razr Plus 2024 for an ultra wide sensor on the Razr Ultra 2025. You still get 2x optical zoom, but it does that by cropping in rather than using a dedicated sensor \u2013 something a number of other phones, like the iPhone 16, also do.\nThe Razr Ultra 2025\u2019s dual 50-megapixel sensors deliver consistent results and while I personally don\u2019t love ultra wide shots on the whole \u2013 I always think they look a little odd \u2013 there will be some who prefer the option to fit more in their shots than to zoom in closer. The main sensor delivers some lovely images in good lighting conditions, handling dynamic range well and offering great detail and a true representation of what you actually see with your own eyes. The images are more vivid and more saturated than the Apple iPhone 16 Pro, but the result of that is very shareable photos that are full of life.\nLow light results are good too and while more noise does creep in along with less detail in some situations, I got some fabulous shots from the Razr Ultra 2025 during a weekend in New York. Broadway looked stunning with all the bright lights and bold colours, while a wall of graffiti on a cloudy evening was well represented too.\nI mentioned the Razr Ultra 2025 offering 2x optical zoom, which offers decent results in good lighting, but there is also 30x digital zoom. This I wouldn\u2019t bother with as it\u2019s generally pretty bad, like most digital zoom options out there. It is useful for seeing an airport departure board from a distance, but it\u2019s not going to give you a good shot of the Statue of Liberty from Battery Park.\nImages taken in the default \u201cNatural\u201d mode are \u201cPantone-Validated\u201d like the displays, and they were my personal preference for their true to life results. There is a new \u201cSignature\u201d mode too however, which you can either take at face value as a \u201cunique Moto Color Style\u201d, or customise to change the color balance and tone of your shots to your preferences, applying that to the images you take. To customise the Signature style, you import five images of food, five portrait shots and five landscape and then adjust each photo so the AI can learn your preferences.\nOnce setup, the Signature mode is selected at capture stage rather than within the editing suite of Google Photos. To select it, you need to tap on the three star icon at the top of the camera screen and AI will then apply what it believes will be to your taste in terms of preferences depending on whether you\u2019ve taken a portrait, landscape or food shot. As I said, I found Natural to be best but if you like something specific, like very vivid shots or blue undertones, Signature gives you those options.\nIn terms of editing, Google Photos offers plenty, including Magic Eraser for removing unwanted objects in the background, as well as a \u201cSuggestions\u201d section that offers one-button taps for edits like unblurring, enhancing and adjusting dynamic range in shots.\nOverall, the camera offering is simple on the Razr Ultra 2025 with an easy point and shoot approach for decent shots, combined with simple editing options to help you get the most out of your shots. There are also some handy features like a preview appearing on the external display that\u2019s great for selfies and helping anyone you\u2019re taking a photo of see what they look like, as well as an old school Camcorder mode for video recording that launches when you hold the Razr Ultra 2025 at a 90-degree angle on its side.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025: software and AI\nRunning on virtually stock Android (if you ignore a couple of additional Moto apps), there\u2019s a clean and relatively bloat-free software experience on the Razr Ultra 2025. The interface is slick and smooth, everything is easy to access and there\u2019s plenty of customisation available.\nAs the software is so close to stock Android however, it\u2019s perhaps even more disappointing that Motorola only supports three years of OS updates. With Samsung and Google both offering seven, and Samsung having significant more bloat on its devices \u2013 by which I mean more duplication of apps like the gallery and browser \u2013 you would think it would be more effort for Samsung to support updates for longer and yet it offers over double what you get with Motorola. You get security updates for four years on the Razr Ultra 2025, but even so, Motorola is effectively making this device redundant after three years and that feels mean for a $1,000 phone.\nIf you can forgive the stingy update offering however, there is a lovely and friendly interface here and some neat software features, such as tapping on the bottom of the external display to expand an app around the cameras and use more of the small screen.\nMotorola offers a number of gestures too, from a double flick of the wrist to open up the camera, to a double karate chop turning the torch on and off, and while they will be familiar to Razr users and not necessarily new for the Razr Ultra 2025, both are particular favorites of mine. I used the wrist flick for the camera multiple times a day, and I also turned on the slide gesture on the power button to show notifications. You can have that slide feature zoom in and out instead though, giving you a couple of options.\nMoto AI isn\u2019t new either in that you\u2019ll find it on several of the company\u2019s phones, though there are a couple of new features for the Razr Ultra 2025, as well as the new dedicated button on the left. That button can\u2019t be changed away from Moto AI but you can give it a dual purpose at least, with a press and hold launching Moto AI, while a double press can take you straight to \u2018Update me\u2019 \u2013 more on that in a second.\nImage Studio is new and similar to Apple\u2019s Image Playground and Samsung\u2019s Sketch to Image, enabling you to use AI to generate images, whether you sketch one or describe one. I got my seven year old to draw her teddy and a puffin and while her drawings were a little rough around the edges, Image Studio did produce some decent results (as well as some not so great ones). Playlist Studio is new too and lets you create a playlist depending on your mood, though it currently only works with Amazon Music it seems so this feels limited still.\nElsewhere, there\u2019s the \u2018Remember this\u2019, \u2018Take notes\u2019, \u2018Ask or search\u2019 and \u2018Update me\u2019 functions, all of which lean on AI. All of those were available previously (though some have been updated) and like most AI offerings, I still think they need refining.\nThe \u2018Update me\u2019 feature, for example, will summarise notifications, which is handy for when you might have had your phone in Do Not Disturb mode. The summaries aren\u2019t particularly accurate though, and while they offer the general gist of a WhatsApp chat for example, they often misread the context resulting in summaries that are way off the mark. Taking notes meanwhile, is a little slow, though it does differentiate speakers which is more helpful than Apple\u2019s transcribing option that just gives you a block of text.\nThe Razr Motorola also introduced a \u2018Look and Talk\u2019 feature that\u2019s exclusive to the Razr Ultra 2025, allowing you to speak to Gemini without having to say anything first or press any buttons. As the feature\u2019s name suggests, you simply look at the phone when the phone is in stand mode or tent mode and a colourful glow runs around the perimeter of the Razr Ultra 2025\u2019s external display, very much like Apple Intelligence on the latest iPhones.\nIf you look straight at the Razr Ultra 2025, the screen says \u201cListening\u201d and when you speak, it will answer your question. It works well enough, but it isn\u2019t a soul reason to buy a phone.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025: performance and battery\nWhat is a solid reason to buy the Razr Ultra 2025 is its performance because it\u2019s brilliant. Qualcomm\u2019s flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite runs this device and the experience is superb. Day to day tasks are effortless, with the Razr Ultra 2025 switching between apps and tasks without any hint of an issue. I\u2019m more of a casual gamer than a die hard Call of Duty fan, but gaming wasn\u2019t an issue for the Razr Ultra 2025 either, with a smooth and judder-free experience.\nI was slightly concerned about such a powerful chipset being in such a small device, but the Razr Ultra 2025 didn\u2019t seem to have any heat issues, which was a relief. I don\u2019t love benchmarks but for reference, the Razr Ultra 2025 came in just under the Galaxy S25 but above the Oppo Find X8 Pro and Galaxy Z Flip 6 for single core tests.\nMeanwhile, battery life is superior to the Razr Plus 2024, I am thrilled to say. Now, battery of course depends on the type of user you are so do keep that in mind, but I finished most days on between 35 and 45 per cent, and that was during a testing period so I was using the phone more than average.\nI was testing the camera, taking multiple calls, replying to countless messages and emails, and using all the AI features and I still finished the day with over 30 per cent at 11pm after starting the day at 7am with 100 per cent. Charging is nice and speedy too however, so even if you do need a top up before a night out, you\u2019ll get around 15 per cent in 10 minutes which should make sure you get your cab home at the end of the night.\nThe Razr Ultra 2025 has bumped up its charging support from 45W in the Razr Plus 2024 to 68W and there\u2019s 30W wireless charging too should you prefer that method.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025: price and availability\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 was announced on April 24, 2025, with pre-order in the US starting on May 7, 2025. There is one storage model of 512GB, which has 16GB of RAM, and that model will cost $1,299. Availability will begin from May 18, 2025, though some carriers, like Verizon, may offer it earlier.\nFor those in the UK and Europe, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 goes by the name Razr 60 Ultra and it is already on sale. Again, there is only one storage option and it costs \u00a31,099.99 in the UK and \u20ac1,299 in Europe.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025: verdict\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 gets so many things right. The design may not have changed much since the Razr Plus 2024 but various improvements have been made under the surface, including a stronger external display, dust resistance and a less visible crease.\nThe finish options are lovely, both displays are superb and brighter than previously, camera results are decent and performance is excellent. The Moto AI offering still has a way to go before it delivers on all its promises and the three years of OS updates is well below average, but that\u2019s really all there is to complain about.\nThe combination of a great design, solid performance, decent camera results and great battery life (with speedy charging) make the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 the flip phone to beat for this year."

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nI know what you\u2019re thinking, isn\u2019t the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra just like the last Ultra phone? Sure, the hardware features aren\u2019t that different to before (apart from a few important ones, as you\u2019ll find out), but where Samsung has pushed ahead is in the software, specifically Galaxy AI. But are these AI features compelling and regularly useful enough to make it worth buying, especially if you own the last Ultra? I\u2019ve found out, and was taken aback by my conclusion.\nAbout our Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review\nOur Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review was first published on February 5, 2025. We revisited the phone at the beginning of May, and you can read our updated opinion of the phone below. The review score has not been altered, and it remains a recommended purchase.\nSpecs\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | |\n| Size | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm (6.4 x 3.1 x 0.32 inches) |\n| Weight | 218 grams (7.7 ounces) |\n| Screen and resolution | 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X\n3,120 x 1,440 pixels (QHD+) 1-120Hz HDR10+ 2,600 nits peak brightness Corning Gorilla Armor 2 |\n| Operating system | One UI 7 based on Android 15, supported for seven years |\n| Storage | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\n| Processor and RAM | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen Elite for Galaxy with 12GB of RAM |\n| Cameras | Rear cameras:\n200MP primary, OIS 50MP wide-angle 50MP periscope telephoto, 5x optical zoom 10MP telephoto, 3x optical zoom 100x Space Zoom Front camera: 12MP, f/2.2, autofocus |\n| Durability | IP68, titanium frame, Gorilla Armor 2 glass |\n| Battery and charging | 5,000mAh\n45W wired charging 15W Wireless charging (Qi2 Ready) Reverse wireless charging |\n| Colors | Retail: Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silverblue, Titanium Whitesilver\nOnline Exclusives: Titanium Jetblack, Titanium Jadegreen, Titanium Pinkgold |\n| Price | Starting at $1,300 |\nRevisiting the Galaxy S25\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung\u2019s top smartphone at the moment, and one of the most expensive smartphones you can buy. You need to be sure you\u2019re making the right decision, so although it\u2019s only a few months since it was released and we published our review, I wanted to revisit it and see if my opinion about it had changed.\nOver the course of a few days, I rediscovered the Galaxy S25 Ultra and in the end, came to very similar conclusions to my original review. I\u2019m pleased about this, because it shows my original instincts were accurate, but also disappointed as the phone has problems I don\u2019t think should exist on a top phone from one of the biggest manufacturers in the world.\nPerhaps the most egregious is I still find it uncomfortable to hold due to the flat sides and sharp edges. It\u2019s a design misstep I find frustrating, as there\u2019s no value in making the phone so angular. I can accept the overall size and am pleased about the weight reduction, but I\u2019d immediately put it in a case to try and improve in-hand feel if I was going to use it all the time.\nI didn\u2019t compare the main camera to any other device, so can\u2019t make any comment on whether it has caught up or not, but I did feel the need to edit them, and sometimes quite extensively. Luckily the editing suite is excellent, but it does shows Samsung hasn\u2019t got the camera tuning quite right. Once I\u2019d played around with the photos I was happy with most of them. It\u2019s just not a shoot-and-share camera.\nOn a more positive note, the screen is easily the best on a top smartphone at the moment. Apart from the size and resolution, it\u2019s the brightness and very effective anti-reflective coating that makes it a winner. I had no problem seeing the screen regardless of the lighting conditions. What about Galaxy AI? I didn\u2019t make use of any Galaxy AI features at all, which should tell you everything you need to know about them.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is an excellent all-rounder, but it\u2019s not a charming, characterful phone, and it has its fair share of negative aspects that frustrate, especially when phones like the Google Pixel 9 and OnePlus 13 exist and cost a lot less. It\u2019s still going to please most people if only because of its sheer ability, but it\u2019s not as desirable as it should be.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: design\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra has changed quite a lot from the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but as most of the alterations are quite small, listing them individually won\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s best to take an overall look at the shape and design instead. The biggest and most easily realized change is it\u2019s 15 grams lighter at 218 grams, and it\u2019s so much more manageable than before. Hold the two phones together, and the S25 Ultra feels sensibly sized, even if its specification suggests otherwise. It\u2019s Ultra in name and not size and weight anymore. I\u2019ve had it in my pocket and it\u2019s no more bothersome than the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nSamsung has rounded the corners for \u201cimproved grip,\u201d and it doesn\u2019t dig into your palm like the S24 Ultra. However, it has flattened the sides, top, and bottom of the frame, which no longer taper between the screen or glass back, and instead meet at a sharp angle. It\u2019s uncomfortable to grip, so the improvements in the rounded corners are negated by worse in-hand feel.\nIt\u2019s also quite a slippery phone. The flat titanium chassis does not provide much grip, especially against clean, oil-free hands. The tighter you hold it, the more you notice the sharp sides. Samsung says it has improved the titanium for more durability, and the Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass is more resistant to fractures. The screen also has improved anti-reflection coating, which along with the stellar brightness means I\u2019ve had no problem seeing it in direct sunlight, plus there\u2019s an IP68 dust and water resistance rating. This is a durable phone.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s design has caused controversy due to the rings around the cameras on the back. These are stuck on, rather than being part of the glass back itself. It\u2019s not an especially elegant or \u201cpremium\u201d solution, but unless you deliberately pry them off the phone, it\u2019s unlikely to be an issue. Still recognizable as a Galaxy S-series Ultra model, the S25 Ultra\u2019s innocuous design and annoyingly sharp edges are saved by the meaningful weight reduction and further work on overall durability.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: camera\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s 200-megapixel main camera and pair of telephoto cameras will be familiar to owners of the last Ultra, but the 50MP wide-angle camera is all-new for this phone. I\u2019ve griped about terrible 8MP wide-angle cameras for a while, so it\u2019s great to see a brand make an effort, and it really pays off. Detail, colors, and dynamic range are all excellent, putting it well ahead of the wide-angle camera on the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max in a separate test.\nYou probably won\u2019t be using the wide-angle as much as the main or telephoto cameras though. The main camera doesn\u2019t over-saturate images or struggle with exposure like it used to, and gets the balance right in both sunny and overcast conditions, but it doesn\u2019t pack as much detail into shots as you may expect. It lost out to the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max in our test, which showed up where Samsung\u2019s main camera still needs work to make the most out of its massive megapixel count.\nTelephoto shots at 3x and 5x look great, but the 10x hybrid\u2019s photos are pixelated and smoothed out when you crop them, making it a disappointment. Zoom to 30x and this effect is even more pronounced, and while it\u2019s usable, the shots won\u2019t win any sharpness or detail prizes. Samsung\u2019s final zoom setting, 100x, is impressive in that I can tell what it is in the photo, but I\u2019d never want to share it or keep it for posterity either. Stay in the 3x and 5x zoom range, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra is superb, and the main camera takes solid photos provided you don\u2019t look too closely.\nI like Samsung\u2019s editing suite, especially the new filter system and the way you can quickly change the style. It\u2019s Samsung\u2019s take on Apple\u2019s Photographic Styles, and it has succeeded in making it easier to use and more relevant to people. Shoot video and the automatic slow-motion mode is fun and requires no actual effort to use, but the Audio Eraser feature \u2014 which removes background noise from your videos \u2014 is very situation dependent, and doesn\u2019t always make much of a difference. Use Pro mode and you can shoot video in LOG format ready for color correction later.\nI do feel that for $1,300 and the title of Samsung\u2019s top flagship phone, the camera should impress more than it does on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The new wide-angle is a definite step forward, but there\u2019s a haziness and blur in the finer details from the main camera which wasn\u2019t present on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Software changes have affected the 10x hybrid zoom, as increased smoothing has robbed it of some natural texture, but the 30x is a definite improvement over the S24 Ultra. However, I rarely use it, so technical advances have little impact on my day-to-day photography.\nI personally miss the Bluetooth-enabled S Pen stylus\u2019s ability to act as a remote shutter release. No, I didn\u2019t use it everyday, but when I did need it, it was invaluable. Wide-angle camera aside, there\u2019s not much here that can be called a big step forward over the Galaxy S24 Ultra, or anything that makes the S25 Ultra a must-buy for keen mobile photographers either.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: software and Galaxy AI\nOne UI 7 over Android 15 is installed on the Galaxy S25 Ultra at launch, and Samsung will support it with seven years of both major software and security updates. This is superb, and gives the phone masses of longevity. The software is fast, smooth, and reliable. It\u2019s also feature packed, but sensibly ordered to make finding things simple, while the global search is good at pinpointing what you need.\nSome will like the new separate notification and quick settings pull down menu, but I find it annoying as I frequently pull down the wrong one when I\u2019m in a hurry and using it with one hand. The switch to a vertical app drawer is far more welcome (activate it by sorting apps alphabetically), and it\u2019s faster to locate apps than with Samsung\u2019s old page-based system. Multi-tasking is slick too, right down to how smooth the system is when you resize windows.\nOne UI 7 is the best version of Samsung\u2019s software yet, but the company is using Galaxy AI to encourage you to buy the S25 Ultra. A lot of what was available on the Galaxy S24 Ultra \u2014 from AI summaries and translation, to Circle to Search and writing assistance in text messages \u2014 makes a return, but now it has the Now Brief and the Now Bar, which are supposed to make the phone more personal, and help you take back time for yourself.\nThe Now Brief gives a summary of your day in the morning, at midday, in the evening, and before bed. It includes the weather, meetings on your calendar, travel reminders, navigation, and if you\u2019re wearing a Galaxy smartwatch or the Galaxy Ring, data from Samsung Health too. To get much from the Now Brief, you need a lot going on, be in a position where you\u2019ll probably forget things, and regularly wear a Samsung wearable. If this doesn\u2019t describe your life, it\u2019s not very informative.\nIt lives in a widget on the Home screen but also informs the Now Bar, which sits at the bottom of the lock screen. It\u2019s a bit like Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island, but less useful. It works with Samsung apps like the clock and Notes, plus it\u2019ll show sports information from Google, and music playback from certain apps. But it doesn\u2019t show my car parking timer like the Dynamic Island, or handy information from travel apps outside of live navigation for example. It\u2019s sure to improve, but at the moment there will be times when you don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a feature at all.\nHow much you get from Galaxy AI depends on your personal needs. Translation is helpful if you travel a lot to places where you don\u2019t speak the language, the Now Brief may be helpful if your diary is out of control, and summaries may be helpful if you take a lot of extensive notes during meetings or presentations. But I suspect most of these will only be helpful occasionally. Samsung really pushed the personal assistant angle with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Now Brief, but it hasn\u2019t landed for me.\nGoogle Gemini has replaced Bixby, and provided you don\u2019t ask it anything too complicated \u2014 it sets timers like a fiend \u2014 it does the job. The conversational aspect sounds and feels natural, but Gemini loves to talk so be prepared for it to go on and on until you stop it. It\u2019s good at summarizing, such as returning a list of songs from a specific genre, but it also gets plenty wrong when you want specifics. For example, asking it for songs from K-pop girl groups, it still put in songs from boy bands. It doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. Gemini isn\u2019t an S25 Ultra-only feature either.\nI\u2019ll end with a couple of positives. I love the way you can search for settings using your voice, which has worked seamlessly and saves a lot of time, plus Samsung\u2019s Keyboard doesn\u2019t need to be the default option as it\u2019s built into Search. The updated Circle to Search now looks for audio in videos, plus it recognizes phone numbers and addresses in images, so you can dial or look up locations directly from a photo. These are genuinely helpful time-savers, quickly accessed on the phone, without any need for Samsung to turn to the marketing team in order to \u201csell\u201d them to us.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: screen and performance\nTwo features which have always made the Ultra ultra still remain \u2014 a massive screen and the fastest processor you can get. The 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED has a 120Hz refresh rate and a whopping 3120 x 1440 pixel maximum resolution, plus it\u2019s incredibly bright and the fantastic anti-reflective coating makes it easy to see in almost every situation and environment. It\u2019s a true beauty, and a high point of the phone.\n| Geekbench 6 | CPU (Single) | CPU (Multi) | GPU |\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | 2,974 | 9,475 | 17,776 |\n| OnePlus 13 | 3,016 | 9,218 | 17,607 |\n| Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro | 3,073 | 9,855 | 19,403 |\nSamsung has collaborated with Qualcomm on a special Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, where special attention has been paid to the NPU to keep up with all those AI demands. It\u2019s faultless, and I\u2019ve not seen anything but lightning fast response times and performance from it. However, it doesn\u2019t seem more powerful in daily use than the Snapdragon 8 Elite in the OnePlus 13 or Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro.\n| 3DMark | Solar Bay | Solar Bay Stress Test (Best loop) | Battery % reduction |\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | 12,229 | 10,500 | -13% |\n| OnePlus 13 | 11,714 | 11,774 | -17% |\n| Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro | 10,009 | 10,009 | -13% |\nIt has no issues playing games like Asphalt Legends: Unite at its highest settings, and the phone doesn\u2019t get hot when you select the device\u2019s performance mode. Running the 3DMark benchmarking app\u2019s Solar Bay Stress Test does make the phone very warm, but never to the point where it overheats, or that it gets too hot to hold. This is the same as I found with the other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones I\u2019ve used since the Realme GT 7 Pro.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: battery and charging\nWith around three hours of screen time each day, without playing games, the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s 5,000mAh battery has lasted two full days before it needed recharging. Add games, 4K video recording, and some AI use and it won\u2019t make it through the second day. It has proven to be as efficient and long-lasting as the OnePlus 13.\nPlug in a compatible 45W charger (which doesn\u2019t come in the box) and it takes an hour and five minutes to fully charge the battery. The speed is more impressive when you simply want to top-up the battery, or give it a boost at the last minute before going out. The same 45W charger energizes the battery to 50% in 20 minutes, and reaches 75% in 30 minutes. The phone has 15W wireless charging, and is \u201cQi2 Ready,\u201d which means it supports the standard, but needs a compatible case with the magnets built into it to operate.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: price and availability\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will be available from February 7. It starts at $1,300 for the 256GB version, and rises to $1,420 for the 512GB model, then tops out at $1,660 for the 1TB Galaxy S25 Ultra. These prices match the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.\nThere aren\u2019t many other non-folding Android phones that cost this much, and the problem for Samsung is, several that are serious challengers cost a lot less. The OnePlus 13 is superb and starts at $900, while the Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $1,000 and impresses with its software and camera. Samsung\u2019s top phone is also more expensive than Apple\u2019s top iPhone, the 16 Pro Max.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: verdict\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a powerhouse and its performance, screen, and battery life will impress and satisfy most people who buy one. It\u2019s also a phone that will last years due to its durability, software commitment, and wealth of features. However, as an expensive device all this isn\u2019t noteworthy, it\u2019s expected.\nThis is where the S25 Ultra falls down. It does what\u2019s required, but it doesn\u2019t quite nail the extras that make it worth so much money, or a strong recommendation over some tough competition. The Now Brief and Galaxy AI have their uses, but not everyone is going to find them regularly useful. Many of its best AI features aren\u2019t unique to the phone either. Then there are the omissions and cutbacks. There\u2019s no built in Qi2 wireless charging, wired fast charging falls behind the OnePlus 13\u2019s speed, the S Pen is now less useful, and the camera \u2014 while improved \u2014 has some odd issues I wouldn\u2019t expect. Samsung wants Galaxy AI to be the feature that pulls you in, but it isn\u2019t consistent, compelling, or regularly enticing enough to do so.\nDoes all this mean you shouldn\u2019t buy it? No, it\u2019s still excellent and you won\u2019t regret buying it, but there are several other phones that represent far better value that do just as much, and sometimes perform even better. This is what took me aback, because it\u2019s the first time in several years I\u2019ve not wholeheartedly been behind the an S-series Ultra model. It says a lot about the direction Samsung has taken, and about the quality of the competition."

Instead of the big upgrades that we saw with the Pixel 9 series \u2014 and this year\u2019s base Google Pixel 10 \u2014 Google\u2019s Pro models feature more modest upgrades.\nYet, the Pixel 10 Pro builds on an already-excellent smartphone, so are these modest upgrades enough for it to stake a claim as the best phone of 2025?. Should you buy the Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL? I spent half an hour with them at Google\u2019s Pixel 10 launch in New York City today, and it turns out that modest upgrades to an excellent phone can make for an even better all-around phone. Here\u2019s our first look at Google\u2019s new Pro lineup.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL cameras are familiar yet different\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL both feature the same design as last year\u2019s devices, complete with the horizontal camera bar housing a triple camera setup. There are subtle changes to the OIS on the telephoto, but otherwise, the 50MP wide camera, 48MP ultrawide, and 48MP telephoto (offering 5x optical zoom) all match the camera on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nYet, despite the identical specifications on paper, both phones introduce several new Pixel camera features that set the Pixel 10 Pro series apart from last year\u2019s models.\nFirst, there\u2019s a new Pro Res Zoom as Google uses the first-ever diffusion model and the largest ever model in the Pixel camera to deliver up to 100x zoom. Unlike the dual telephoto cameras on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the surprising part about Pro Res Zoom is that Google achieves this zoom with just a single telephoto lens.\nThe company says the feature is best used for capturing photos of landscapes or landmarks, but also notes that when a person is spotted in the image, the algorithm applies special tuning to ensure that features appear accurate and life-like and to prevent misrepresentation.\nThen there\u2019s a new certification to help identify and track the source of any images, as well as determine which images were created with AI. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL cameras feature C2PA Content Credentials built into the camera itself \u2014 for the first time in a smartphone \u2014 which secures metadata within the image to ensure its entire journey can be documented.\nGoogle already has one of the best smartphone cameras, and the improvements to the Pixel 10 Pro camera, as well as the Pro Res Zoom feature, ensure the Pixel 10 Pro series is likely to pick up that mantle.\nA new era for Pro performance\nOne of the more notable changes in the new Pixel 10 series is the Tensor G5 processor. This is a key moment in Google\u2019s smartphone journey as the company has switched from using Samsung Foundry as its chipmaker to the world\u2019s biggest smartphone chipmaker, TSMC.\nBuilt upon the same 3nm process as rival chipsets like the Apple A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite in many smartphones \u2014 including the OnePlus 13, Galaxy S25 Edge, and Galaxy Z Fold 7 \u2014 the Tensor G5 brings a significant improvement to the performance of all the Pixel 10 series smartphones.\nIt\u2019s the biggest upgrade since the first Tensor processor launched five years ago and is built for deeper customization and the latest advancements in on-device AI. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) \u2014 which is used to accelerate machine learning workloads and improve AI performance \u2014 is 60% more powerful, while the CPU is 34% faster than last year\u2019s Tensor G4. There\u2019s also an upgraded ISP for better photography, and all-around improvements to performance and battery life.\nBig changes to battery life and charging speeds\nThe other area where the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL offer significant improvements is in battery life and charging, but here the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a further advantage over its sibling.\nBoth phones feature larger batteries than last year, but neither is significantly larger. The Pixel 10 Pro has a 4,870 mAh battery \u2014 up from 4,700 mAh in the Pixel 9 Pro \u2014 while the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 5,200 mAh battery, which is up from a 5,060 mAh battery in the Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nThe biggest improvements come in the form of charging speeds. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W charging, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL boosts this considerably to 45W. This means the Pixel 10 Pro should charge to 55% in around 30 minutes, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL will charge to 70% in the same period.\nYet, even this isn\u2019t the biggest improvement: the Pixel 10 series is the first Android phone to support Qi2 magnetic charging out of the box, without needing a separate accessory. Google is calling it PixelSnap, but it\u2019s the same as Qi2, and it means the Pixel 10 series can use the variety of MagSafe charging solutions available for the iPhone. The Pixel 10 Pro will charge at 15W when charging wirelessly, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL supports Qi2.2 and 25W wireless charging.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro series has excellent software again\nOne of the hallmark features of the Pixel 10 Pro series, as with the past nine generations, is Google\u2019s excellent software features. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL run Android 16 with Google\u2019s new Material 3 Expressive UI out of the box and come with seven years of software and security updates, meaning they\u2019ll be supported until at least Android 23.\nAlongside the core Android 16 features, the Pixel 10 Pro series also gains some exclusive Gemini features to help it stand out from the competition. Key to the new series is the Magic Cue feature, a new set of helpful and proactive suggestions that leverage the Tensor G5 processor and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano model to enable real-time contextual suggestions. Early use cases include adding events or previewing weather forecasts for upcoming travel, but the possibilities for this feature are vast.\nThen there are the other software additions, including a Daily Hub digest that\u2019s similar to Samsung\u2019s Now Brief, improvements to Call screening, and a big update to voice translation: the Pixel 10 Pro series can translate phone calls in real-time, and the caller on the other end will hear the translation in their language using your voice. Google is known for excellent software, and the Pixel 10 Pro series continues this trend.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro proves small upgrades can make a big difference\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL both prove that small upgrades can make a sizeable difference to the all-around user experience. There are only a handful of updates compared to the Pixel 9 Pro, yet each of these makes the experience noticeably better.\nI only spent half an hour with the Pixel 10 Pro series, but one thing is clear: whether it\u2019s the new Pro Res Zoom feature, Qi2.2 magnetic charging in the Pixel 10 Pro XL, the Tensor G5 processor, or the plethora of Gemini features, these are likely to pick up from the Pixel 9 Pro series as some of the best phones you can buy.\nThere\u2019s one key thing to note, however: this year, Google has followed Apple\u2019s lead, and the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are both eSIM-only in the US. This means there\u2019s no physical SIM card support, but the wide availability should mean that eSIMs should become easier to activate amongst the carriers.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL price and availability\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are both available to pre-order today and will launch on August 28. Both are available in the same Obsidian and Porcelain colors as last year, but also new Moonstone and Jade shades.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB of storage, while upgrades to higher storage options will cost a slight premium. The 256GB model costs $1,099, the 512GB model an additional $120, and the top-tier 1TB model costs $1,449.\nMeanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro XL starts at 256GB storage, and is also available with 512GB or 1TB of storage. Each option costs $100 more than the equivalent Pixel 10 Pro option.\nPixel 10 Pro\nPixel 10 Pro XL"
