      "feedback": "**Actionable edit instructions (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Clarify the causal chain**: Break the first sentence into two—first, state that a Fed‑cut cycle is expected to lower borrowing costs for capital‑intensive firms; second, explain how that directly boosts ACM’s revenue‑growth prospects (e.g., higher demand for advanced‑node equipment).  \n2. **Add macro detail**: Insert a brief note on current inflation (e.g., CPI 3.5% YoY) and the Fed’s policy minutes, citing *C22MKA9VY* to anchor the Fed‑cut expectation.  \n3. **Quantify the small‑cap mean‑reversion**: After mentioning the 2008‑level valuation, add the exact P/E ratio (e.g., 12x vs. 20x for S&P 500) and the negative‑earning percentage (e.g., 35% vs. 20% historically), citing *Q7VVGNSQE*.  \n4. **Specify timing windows**: Replace “first Fed cut in Q4 2025 through the first half of 2026” with a clearer timeline: “Fed cut expected September 2025 → small‑cap valuation gap narrows by March 2026 → ACM’s revenue guidance realized by Q2 2026.”  \n5. **Enhance risk framing**: Add a sentence on export‑control risk (e.g., “US‑China tensions could trigger new export restrictions on semiconductor equipment, potentially curtailing ACM’s China sales”), citing *SK994CBWR*.  \n6. **Strengthen watch signals**: List them as a short series: “Fed minutes, CPI releases, Russell 2000 P/E, ACM Q3 earnings guidance.”  \n7. **Cite each claim**: Ensure every numeric or factual statement ends with the appropriate source ID (e.g., *SK994CBWR*, *C22MKA9VY*, *Q7VVGNSQE*).  \n8. **Maintain paragraph length**: Keep the revised paragraph within 4–5 sentences, using semicolons or commas to separate linked ideas while preserving readability.",
