  "title": "Trump's taken a gamble. It could make him the greatest of all time",
  "description": "Biden's cognitive decline was much worse than the Blues admitted - but it was never as bad as the Reds said. It was the same with Reagan's naps, Clinton's denials, Obamacare.",
  "content": "Joe Biden's cognitive decline was much worse than the Blues admitted \u2014 but it was never as bad as the Reds said.\n\nIt was the same with Reagan's naps, Clinton's denials, George W. Bush's syntax, Obamacare.\n\nEverything is either the end of the Republic or a nothingburger, and the truth \u2014 often slippery, dull, inconvenient \u2014 gets trampled in the stampede.\n\nSo it goes with the Trump presidency. Not as great as MAGA believes, not as cataclysmic as the left is certain it is.\n\nTrump's presidency is a Rorschach test in red, white and blue ink. The same speech, the same policy, the same offhand comment about a nuclear treaty or a TikTok ban is, depending on your priors, either a masterstroke or the dark unraveling of democracy.\n\nLeave aside the buckraking, the casual rewriting of scientific consensus, and the 1,001 other Trump postures that send tens of millions of Americans \u2014 with and without Trump Derangement Syndrome \u2014 through the woods and into the river. The real ledger of his presidency can be found in Reagan's old tri-part stool: national security, economics and cultural issues.\n\nIn each case, the record is mixed \u2014 and it is too soon to make any ultimate judgment.\n\nFor now: Not perfect, not hopeless.\n\nIn each case, Trump's critics lack a coherent alternative that isn't the same playbook that's failed for years or even decades. And in each case, Trump and his team have a theory of the case about how their vision can work \u2014 and they just might be right.\n\nTrump's worldview has always been mercantile, but not isolationist. He sees the world as a set of deals to be made \u2014 leverage every American advantage to remake the global order. Access to the American market is the crown jewel, and he's willing to make everyone \u2014 allies, adversaries, fence-sitters \u2014 pay rent to get it.\n\nA reimagined NATO that puts more onus on Europe \u2014 think the Eisenhower era's wary warnings about being 'Europe's policeman,' now delivered in all caps. A Turkey pulled out of Russia's orbit with carrots and sticks. A Saudi Arabia drawn closer not through gauzy speeches about 'shared values' but through transactional clarity: oil, arms, and regional stability.\n\nThe capstone of the vision: slicing the melon with China. Not a Cold War forever, not decoupling, but an agreement on spheres of influence \u2014 an understanding that divides the globe into manageable zones, limiting the need for a costly, endless, dangerous, multidimensional struggle.\n\nHis critics call it na\u00efve, dangerous, appeasement by another name \u2014 the kind of thinking that got Chamberlain a footnote and a down arrow in history books.\n\nTrump's defenders say it's realism, the first actual attempt to update America's role in the world for good since the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nOn economics, Trumpism is a strange brew \u2014 part Reagan, part Ross Perot, part Queens real estate. Tariffs are not an ideology, they're a tool. A cudgel in one hand, those carrots in the other.\n\nLow taxes are a given. Cheaper energy through drilling and deregulation is gospel. Reducing the headcount of the federal bureaucracy isn't just about cutting costs, it's about cutting resistance. The theory is that business investment will fill the gaps left by government retreat, and inefficiencies will be wrung out with two hands like water from a sponge.\n\nTo the MAGA faithful, this is common sense \u2014 'let business do business.' To the left, it's a recipe for plutocracy, a giveaway to the well-connected, a dangerous bet on a market that has never, on its own, delivered for the working class without guardrails.\n\nBut the economic record of the old consensus \u2014 open borders for goods and people, light-touch enforcement, the belief that China's rise would be peaceful and harmonious \u2014 has not and will not work. The US middle class was eroding long before Trump arrived on the scene. His approach is different, and as with Nixon's opening to China, its success will be judged in decades, not news cycles.\n\nIf the first two legs of the stool are matters of strategy and math, the third is emotional, visceral, almost primal. Trump's war on woke is as central to his presidency as tariffs or NATO threats. The targets shift \u2014 one week it's elite universities, the next it's corporate DEI departments, the next it's trans athletes or Sydney Sweeney detractors \u2014 but the through line is the same: America has been hijacked by a cultural elite that mocks, marginalizes, and overrules the majority.\n\nThis is the realm where Trumpism is most potent and most polarizing. It speaks to voters who believe they've been told for years that their values, their language, even their gender and pronouns are out of bounds.\n\nIt's also the arena where critics see him as most destructive, inflaming divisions for short-term gain.\n\nThe president is unrepentant. For Trump, getting rid of political correctness isn't a side project. It's the project.\n\nWith Secretaries Bessent and Rubio amplifying the message in their own spheres \u2014 one with markets, the other with foreign allies and adversaries \u2014 the cultural war is institutional as well as rhetorical. The ghost of Spiro Agnew and the living Pat Buchanan would approve.\n\nHere's the cold truth that the Democrats don't want to dwell on: The pre-Trump ways were failing. There was no serious plan to stop Putin or Xi. The economic trajectory was down, not up, for much of the middle and working classes. Cultural changes were being driven by a minority elite in ways that were out of step with \u2014 and often offensive to \u2014 the majority.\n\nTrump's ways are different. That doesn't mean they're guaranteed to work. His plans for dividing the globe with China may collapse into mistrust and miscalculation. Tariffs could trigger retaliation that costs more jobs than they save. The anti-woke crusade could divide the country even more.\n\nBut the bet Trump's presidency makes is that different is better than failed, and disruption is better than drift. It's the same gamble Teddy Roosevelt made busting trusts, the same gamble Reagan made confronting the Soviets: that the old guard is wrong, and the country can't afford to wait.\n\nIn the end, his presidency will be judged not by the heat it generated but by the results it delivered \u2014 and by whether those results hold after he's gone. If his national security gambit produces stability, if his economic model boosts real wages, if his cultural reset creates more unity than division, the history books will give him his due. If not, the verdict will be as harsh as his opponents have always insisted.\n\nFor now, the stool stands \u2014 wobbly, loud, unconventional, but still upright. And that, in the Trump era, is its own kind of stability.",
