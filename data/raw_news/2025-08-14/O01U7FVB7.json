  "description": "TVs, phones and routers sneak energy even when you think they're off.",
  "content": "The heat is still hanging on across much of the US, and keeping your home comfortable can get expensive quickly. Air conditioning is often the only relief, but running it all day comes with a big price tag. A recent CNET survey found nearly 8 in 10 US adults feel stressed about rising energy bills, and it's easy to see why.\n\nOne way to save that many people overlook is unplugging electronics when they're not in use. Even powered off, certain devices still pull a little electricity. Over time, that \"always on\" draw adds up on your bill. It can also make your AC work harder by adding small amounts of heat to the room.\n\nMaking unplugging part of your daily routine can chip away at those costs. Pair it with other simple changes, like closing blinds during the hottest hours or running ceiling fans, and you might be surprised at how much you save without giving up comfort.\n\nBelow, we'll answer how much money unplugging home appliances can actually save you and whether the energy savings are worth unplugging and replugging appliances each day. Plus, to maximize your energy savings, we have tips on how to lower your water bill, the best temperature to set your thermostat at to save money and the energy-efficient way to do laundry to cut utility costs.\n\nDon't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\n\nCan unplugging appliances actually save me money?\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive to unplug your appliances. After all, they're off, so why would they be sucking up energy?\n\nThe fact is, household appliances actually still use energy even when they are turned off but still plugged in, according to Energy.gov. Whether the device is switched off or in standby mode, some of the worst offenders are:\n\u2022 A device that may still use energy in the form of lights or other displays showing the device is off.\n\u2022 Desktop computers that were put into sleep mode instead of being powered off.\n\u2022 Chargers that still draw power even if the device is not connected.\n\u2022 Media players that continually draw power, especially ones that still might scan for updates in the background.\n\u2022 Phones with displays that show when not in active use, like cordless phones.\n\u2022 New smart home appliances like refrigerators, washers and dryers that have always-on displays, internet connectivity and electronic controls.\n\nReduce your standby power to save electricity and money\n\nMany people are shocked to realize how much standby power can add up. Standby power accounts for 5% to 10% of residential energy use, according to the Department of Energy.\n\nHow much you save could depend on how many devices you use -- and your habits with them. For instance, an educational experiment from Colorado State University found that a combo radio/CD player/tape player used 4 watts continually, whether or not it was in use. Unplugging it when not in use would save 100 times as much power during the lifetime of the device.\n\nA study published by the Natural Resources Defense Council (PDF) found that reducing the load from always-on devices would save consumers a total of $8 billion annually and avoid using 64 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. It also has environmental benefits, like preventing 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution. The NRDC estimated the cost of always-on devices at up to $165 per household per year on average.\n\nHow can I optimize my standby power?\n\nThe first step is, of course, to unplug anything that is not actively in use or not used often. Examples of devices that could easily be unplugged include TVs and set-top boxes in guest rooms. It's also generally easy to unplug media players when not in use, like a radio or CD player. When you take your device off its charger, it can help you get into the habit of unplugging that charger as well. You might also be surprised how many devices we have plugged in that we don't even use anymore. Examples could include old wireless phones, old media players or lamps that are more decorative than functional.\n\nUnplugging and replugging in everything can get tedious, especially if your outlets are in hard-to-reach places. If the outlet is inaccessible, it will be hard to keep up.\n\nInstead, you can also set up ways to make the process of cutting phantom load more automatic. You can plug devices into surge protectors. That way, one flick of a power switch button can turn off multiple devices. You can also get timers to plug devices into or smart plugs so that you can automate when the power is connected to a device. For instance, you might set the time for the TV's power so it is only connected during peak use times like evenings or weekends.\n\nInvesting in a smart thermostat that can keep your room comfortable, while optimizing for power consumption is a good investment for long-term savings. Similarly, installing LED light bulbs is an excellent investment that uses far less energy compared to incandescent lightbulbs. While the initial outlay might seem high, the savings add up over the years.\n\nYou can also look into getting Energy Star products. Many of these products are rated to have lower standby power use than products that are not rated by Energy Star.\n\nAs power bills get higher and more erratic over time, it's more vital than ever to find ways to save on electric costs. For instance, in addition to unplugging the devices in the home, you can take a look at our guide about turning off lights when not in use. Another key way to affect your electric/heating bill for the better is to know the ideal temperature you should set for your home.

      "text": "It pains me to say this, it really does, but taking those long, relaxing baths after a stressful day can come at a steep cost to you. While baths have certain benefits, like soaking away the anxieties and tension of the day, a bath is certainly not the best option for the environment -- or your monthly water bill.\nManaging money is crucial, and it's important to try to save on monthly expenses where you can. You can always save some cash around the home by turning off the lights and adjusting your thermostat, but one solid way to pocket some extra change is by taking a shower instead of a bath (and shortening your showers, too).\nThis isn't to say that baths are out of the question (I know they won't be for me), especially since they have numerous health benefits: promoting relaxation, easing fatigue and treating chronic pain. But switching to the shower more often can help you end up with a few extra dollars in your bank account at the end of each month. Here's exactly how much you can expect to save.\nShowers are actually better than baths\nWhile everyone has a personal preference as to how they like to get clean, showers have several perks that baths don't. First off, showers save water, which is good for the environment. Second, they save you money on your water bill.\nHow much water do showers save?\nThe average amount of water a tub can hold is 80 gallons, but that number can vary depending on your living situation. To fill a tub halfway, you'll probably use around 40 gallons of water. If you like to soak in a tub that's more than halfway, you're probably going to use closer to 60 gallons of water.\nA shower with a regular shower head and standard water pressure spills out 2.5 gallons per minute. On average, people spend 10 minutes in the shower, so the average shower uses 25 gallons of water.\nHow much money do showers save?\nSimilar to varying water usages for each individual, the cost savings will depend on how long you spend in the shower, or how frequently you take baths, and how much your city's water company charges.\nWater companies measure water usage in hundred cubic feet, or CCF. One CCF is equivalent to 748 gallons of water.\nIf you shower 10 minutes every day for a year, you are using 9,125 gallons of water (12.2 CCF). If you take a bath filled halfway every day for a year, you're using 14,600 gallons of water (19.51 CCF).\nIn Charlotte, North Carolina, where I live, water costs $5.29 per CCF for 9 to 16 CCF of water -- or 6,732 to 11,968 gallons -- and $10.03 per CCF for over 16 CCF. Showering daily would come to $64.54 per year per person and using the bath daily would be $195.68 per year per person, approximately three times more expensive.\nThe bottom line\nWhile it's hard to determine exactly how much you'll save per year, on average showering is both more environmentally friendly and economical than bathing. Assuming average times and costs, you could save three times as much on your annual water bills if you take daily showers and just save baths for an occasional luxury.\nKeep in mind that these calculations don't take sewage costs or other water usage -- including the sink, dishwasher, lawn sprinkler -- into consideration.

      "text": "Key survey findings:\n- 78% of US adults are concerned about rising home energy costs.\n- 32% of US adults are leaning on borrowing and payment plans to afford their energy bills.\n- 70% of US adults are taking steps to become more energy efficient.\n- 32% of US adults are concerned about the cost of energy-efficiency projects, such as upgrading the HVAC system or installing solar panels.\nThe heat is already breaking records this summer, and Americans are feeling the burn of rising energy costs.\nAn exclusive CNET Money survey found that more than 78% of US adults are concerned about their home energy bills, and an alarming 32% are turning to financing options, like credit cards, loans or payment plans to get by.\nI'm not surprised by the data. Last month, I reported that 93% of Americans are worried about inflation, and 41% said high utility bills had the biggest sticker shock. The data tracks.\nWe saw small dips in average energy costs over the past three months, but overall, energy costs are up 4.3% since June of 2023, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report. And when utility company costs go up, so do ours, said Daniella Flores, a personal finance expert and CNET Money Expert Review Board member.\nAs concerns about inflation and energy use linger, it may seem like expensive energy bills are a given. But there are steps you can take to lower your energy costs. Here's what CNET uncovered in our latest survey and how experts say you can save both energy and money.\nHome energy bill concerns are growing nationwide\nCNET survey data reveals home energy costs are affecting household finances. Interestingly, we found there isn't much variance by region.\nCNET ranked the top 10 states with the highest electricity bills and found a similar trend that energy costs -- specifically electricity -- aren't a regional issue. The top 10 states with the highest average electricity bills are Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland, Tennessee, West Virginia, Alabama, Alaska and Maine. The top 10\u2019s average monthly electric bills range from $160 to $202 -- well above the national average of $135.\nEven more interesting, only six out of the top 10 are also states with the highest electricity rates. California, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont and Michigan have some of the highest electric rates in the US, but not the highest electric bills.\nMost Americans are struggling to pay rising energy bills\nAs energy costs rise, fitting this unpredictable expense into your budget can be difficult. Most US adults have a plan to tackle high energy bills, but this survey found an alarming 32% of US adults are leaning on borrowing, payment plans or assistance programs to afford their energy bills. Similarly, 24% of participants said they are cutting back on essential purchases to fit energy bills into their budgets.\nOthers are cutting back on nonessential spending (39%), dipping into savings (15%) and increasing their income (13%).\nCan't afford your energy bill? Do this before turning to credit cards\nUsing credit cards may seem like the next best solution if you can't afford to pay your energy bill. But paying for your energy bills with a credit card can be costly in different ways. Not only can this lead to interest and debt if you can't pay the balance back in full, but some energy companies charge a processing fee when you use a credit card to pay your bill.\nInstead, consider one of the below options:\nIf you can\u2019t afford your monthly energy bill without leaning on credit, Flores and Kanj both recommend contacting your utility companies to see if you qualify for a payment plan. A utility-approved payment plan can help you pay off your balance in installments over a set period of time. While payment plans help if you are behind on paying off your bill, it won\u2019t solve the long-term problem of affordable energy costs.\nYou may also qualify for LIHEAP, a federally funded utility bill assistance program. LIHEAP may ease the burden of heating and cooling costs with bill pay assistance, home weatherization repairs or energy crisis help. For more information, you can visit the Office of Community Services website, brochure, email the National Energy Assistance Referral service at energy@ncat.org or call 1-866-NRG-NEAR.\nIf it\u2019s predictability you seek, many utility companies offer budget billing plans. Also known as level billing or average billing, depending on your utility company, budget billing will even out your monthly energy bill versus a fluctuating one based on your seasonal consumption patterns. If enrolled, your utility will use your previous energy usage profile and predict your next 12 months of billing and divide it by 12 months. Under budget billing, your monthly bill will be the same amount each month. If you go over the expected amount at the end of your agreement, you\u2019ll pay the difference. But if you pay for more energy than you use, you\u2019ll see a credit.\n\u201cIf you have an older home, your electricity bill might be a lot more expensive in the summer than it is for the winter,\u201d said Kanj. \u201cThese plans can even out your bill over the full 12 months so that you have a more predictable monthly payment.\u201d\nExpert tips to save money on energy bills\nThe majority of survey respondents (70%) said they are making an effort to be energy efficient. Most are incorporating energy-efficient products, but a smaller percentage are taking on more expensive projects such as upgrading their HVAC system to a more efficient one or installing solar panels.\nHere's what homeowners and renters say they are doing to reduce energy costs, and expert advice to lower your bill even more.\nShop for energy-efficient products\nAccording to the survey, 44% of participants use energy-efficient products such as smart light bulbs, plugs and thermostats.\nSwitching to smart products like these can be effective, said Wael Kanj, a senior research associate at Rewiring America, a nonprofit that supports electrification efforts. Energy-efficient products can help lower your energy bill and improve your heating and cooling system's efficiency. They're small upgrades that can be less daunting to take on than major renovations, said Kanj.\nFlores and their wife live in Washington state and have made energy upgrades, like installing a more efficient air conditioning unit in their home. To save even more money, Flores turns the unit off or raises the temperature setting when they can. They also run ceiling fans to help circulate the air. Despite their best efforts, even the cost of maintaining efficient appliances is getting more expensive.\n\"The largest part of our energy bill seems to be our heating and cooling,\" said Flores. \"Our AC bill is going up summer to summer, year over year because it's getting hotter and drier every summer.\"\nMonitor your thermostat temperature\nIf you rent or can't afford smart home tech upgrades right now, Kanj says there are other small steps you can take to lower your energy bills. If a smart thermostat isn't in the cards right now, try adjusting your thermostat before you leave home to lower costs. 78 degrees is the ideal temperature to set your thermostat to during the summer to save money, according to Energy Star, a program of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Department of Energy. During the winter, the federal program recommends setting your thermostat to 68 degrees.\nParticipate in a virtual power plant\nA virtual power plant is a new power distribution model where an energy operation -- like a utility -- can control how you use your energy or tap into your stored energy. VPP programs in the US are voluntary and aim to relieve the power grid at times of peak demand. Only 3% of survey respondents say they participate in a virtual power plant program. Reed said that number should rise quickly as more utility companies experiment with ways consumers can help the power grid -- and find more incentives for these programs.\nThe benefit of VPP participation is the bill credits in exchange for allowing your utility company -- or another third party -- to leverage your home\u2019s energy technology when the electric grid is overwhelmed. A few common examples are solar batteries, backup battery storage or smart thermostats. When the grid is stressed and by allowing your utility access to your thermostat, for example, it can remotely adjust your home\u2019s temperature in exchange for bill credits.\nInsulate and weatherize windows and doors\nOnly 16% of US adults are insulating their home to improve energy efficiency, the survey reveals. But it's the one tip Kanj recommends the most.\nInsulating your home is a good first step. If your home isn't well-insulated, you'll likely spend more on your heating and cooling bills because you're sending your energy (and money) out the door, he added.\nHow can you tell if the insulation around your windows and doors is working? Check to see if you can feel air escaping through cracks. You can pick up insulation kits and weather stripping at your local hardware store to seal up areas around your home where air is leaking. If you already have insulation installed, make sure it's still intact and not worn out. To further boost your efforts, add insulated window treatments, such as blinds and curtains, to keep your home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.\nCheck to see if you live in a deregulated area\nIf your energy provider's costs have skyrocketed, you may be able to shop around for a new company or energy plan, depending on where you live. First, check if you live in a deregulated state -- also known as an energy choice market. If so, you can compare electricity rates, plans and providers to see if you could be saving money. You might also choose a fixed-rate energy plan, which can provide you with stability and predictability for your gas or electric bills.\nIt's not always easy to figure out how much you're paying, so make sure you understand how to read your energy bill and contact your provider if you have any questions.\nConsider a solar panel investment\nA solar panel investment can help offset some or all of your electricity costs. But it usually comes with a hefty upfront investment in the ballpark of $15,000 to $50,000 based on factors like how many panels you need and where you live. Experts agree, though, that solar panels do eventually pay for themselves. The average payback period is about six to 12 years, CNET contributor Mike De Socio reported last year. After the payback period, all the energy solar panels produce is essentially free.\nAdding a solar battery is another expensive option that can cost around another $10,000. But a solar battery can store excess energy from your panels at night when they aren't producing energy. It can even sell stored energy back to your utility company for bill credits, if your provider has a generous net metering program.\nIf your home isn\u2019t a good candidate for solar panels because of shade or cost, see if community solar is an option in your area. Community solar programs let you buy into a power plan that's connected to a solar farm in your area, Kanj added.\nRead more: 7 Questions to Ask an Energy Provider Before Signing Up\nHow to afford energy efficient upgrades\nDespite most US adults trying to be energy efficient, they're also concerned about the costs. According to the survey, 32% of US adults worry about the expense of energy efficiency projects, while 29% question whether making changes will actually help them save money.\nKanj acknowledges that cost is a big factor for many people, but says that upgrading your HVAC system or replacing it with a heat pump -- a big home renovation 14% of our survey participants said they were tackling -- can make a big difference in your bill for decades to come.\nReed, who also reports on heat pumps for CNET and witnessed first-hand how they operate at CES, said they can serve a dual purpose -- working as an all-electric and energy-efficient alternative to a furnace and an air conditioner.\n\"The Inflation Reduction Act created like an electric bank account for every household where they have access to money that they can use to make these upgrades and bring the cost of these electrical appliances down,\" said Kanj.\nIf you're considering making energy efficient upgrades to your home, make sure you look into the tax credits and rebates you're eligible for, such as the residential clean energy credit and the energy efficient home improvement credit. Many states offer their own credits, too.\nRewiring America also has a savings calculator you can use to find out how much you could save with eligible tax credits and state-level rebates after you enter some household information. If you're feeling overwhelmed and not sure where to start, Kanj recommends scheduling a home energy audit, which is an in-person walk-through of your home with a contractor who will show you more energy-efficient solutions you could make to cut costs. That way, you'll have a plan of options and can choose what fits in your long- and short-term goals, added Kanj.\nMethodology\nAll figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. The total sample size was 2467 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between June 3rd and 5th, 2024. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all US adults 18+, respectively."

      "text": "The Energy Star label has been the official US designation for appliances with low energy requirements since the program was first introduced by President George Bush in 1992. The label helps people save money while reducing the electrical burdens on their homes, and now it's at risk under President Donald Trump.\nOn Tuesday, May 6, CNN reported that, under the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency is planning its \"next phase of organizational improvements,\" which includes the elimination of the Energy Star program.\nEnergy Star ratings aren't only for refrigerators and heat pumps -- they also apply to home devices like smart plugs and thermostats. Given how much extra energy smart devices can tap, those ratings are important for managing electricity use around your home.\n\"Heating and cooling your home is likely your largest energy expense,\" said Energy Trust of Oregon when I asked about key savings spots. \"Using a smart thermostat to save a little energy every day can really add up. That's especially true if paired with other energy-saving changes like making sure your home is properly insulated, sealing any gaps or cracks around doors, windows and ducts, or switching to an energy-efficient heat pump.\"\nIf you're looking for energy-saving options like these, here are the best brands and devices with Energy Star certification.\nSmart thermostats\nWhile smart thermostats tend to have LED displays and touchscreens, they're designed to use little power and often turn off when no one is active nearby, saving energy. Models with Energy Star certification include Nest thermostats, Sensi models, some Ecobee thermostats, and thermostats from Honeywell Home.\nBecause thermostats tie into heating and cooling, they not only save electricity in their own right but can also save a whole lot of energy for the rest of your home, too. That makes them an excellent place to start cutting down on energy use.\nLight Fixtures\nLight fixtures refer to lights that are wired into a home, instead of light bulbs that you replace. Smart home brands make several smart fixtures like these with Energy Star ratings, including models from our top picks like Philips, Wiz and many more. Take a look at this Philips recessed light kit to learn more, like how you can control it and change colors with an app.\nLight strings\nLight strings are typically more decorative than fixtures, with smart features that allow them to change between many different color schemes. We have several examples from brands like Philips, Nanoleaf and Govee. You can find Energy Star string lights in most holiday sections or stores, just look for that blue star logo when you buy.\nDehumidifiers\nDehumidifiers are a godsend for wetter climates, but they can use up large amounts of electricity, especially when they have to work for hours at a time. Energy Star models will help keep running costs low, while smart picks from Homelabs, Frigidaire, Carrier, Honeywell Home and more can be controlled with apps or even connected to your smart thermostat for automation.\nAir conditioners\nYou can check out smaller air conditioners on our list of the best portable air conditioners and our top picks for window AC units. When the days get hot, devices like these can use immense amounts of electricity working to keep things cool.\nLook for models with smart features, like the ability to control remotely via app and voice assistants, and Energy Star ratings. Even better, look for models certified \"most efficient\" from brands like Midea, LG, Hisense, Gradient and others.\nSmart TVs\nToday's smart TVs can serve as home hubs and even give you live views through your security cameras on demand. But they can also use a lot of power, especially if left on for long periods of time, along with other entertainment equipment. A smart plug can help with power control, but a work-free start is to look for TVs that have Energy Star ratings. Brands like LG and Samsung are great places to begin your search.\nWater heaters\nWater heaters can be surprisingly smart, too, with tools like Aquanta's controller and similar equipment that monitor and automatically optimize water heating, much like smart thermostats do for temperature. You can enhance the savings even more by choosing an Energy Star model from brands like American Standard, ACIQ, Friedrich and Rheem. Or you can really lean into savings by switching to a tankless or solar water heater.\nEnergy monitoring devices\nEnergy Star also incorporates broad systems called SHEMS or Smart Home Energy Management Systems, which use technology to unite many Energy Star devices (thermostats, lighting, smart meters, monitor add-ons, security systems, etc.) and put them all under one automated energy use plan to save electricity.\nTechnically, SHEMS are turnkey systems you'd discuss with an authorized smart home installer. However, you can make your own version with an Emporia Energy Monitoring device and associated Emporia smart plugs, or look up smart meter options with your local utility.\nEV chargers\nFinally, if you have a home EV charger or are interested in installing one, note that these garage devices can also have Energy Star ratings. EV chargers from brands (AC and DC) like Schumacher, Pando Electric, ChargePoint, Legrand, Tesla, EvoCharge and many others can qualify to help you save even more.\nFor more smart money management, review how smart thermostats can save you energy, how to use a smart home to save on electricity bills and how home security can give you discounts every month."

      "text": "Electricity seems to cost more every year, and as those expenses rise, consumers are feeling the pinch. This isn't a bill you can just eliminate, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways to save money. If you've been stressing over a giant electric bill, it's time to consider when you're using the most power. The price of electricity changes during the day, rising during peak hours, and becoming more affordable during off-peak hours. Depending on what time of day you're running the washing machine or dishwasher, you might be paying a premium for electricity.\nThis model is like surge pricing that Uber uses, except it's more convenient to use it to your advantage. The pricing varies as per demand -- when the grid is strained with lots of people plugged in, the demand is higher and so are the prices. On the other hand, when the grid isn't as busy, you can get lower pricing. If your utility company has you on a time-of-use plan, you can use it to your advantage during off-peak hours and keep the heavy electricity use limited to the time of day when electricity is at its cheapest. We've also got tips on the best time of day to do laundry to save money, and how to lower your water bill.\nWhat are peak hours?\nIn a time-of-use electricity plan, peak hours -- sometimes referred to as on-peak hours -- are the hours of the day when electricity demand is the highest. During this time, you will be paying the highest amount per kilowatt-hour used.\nSome electricity use is going to be unavoidable, whether it's your refrigerator keeping your food cool or your security system that's always on and protecting your home. Peak hours are a bad time to do tasks that can wait. If you're running large appliances, whether it's your dishwasher or washing machine, it's going to cost you extra during peak hours.\nWhat are off-peak hours?\nIn contrast to peak hours, off-peak hours are the times when electricity prices are cheaper. This is typically the case because fewer people are trying to access the grid during these hours, meaning there is less overall demand and you won't have to pay a premium for each kWh that you use.\nOff-peak hours are a great time to do those more energy-intensive tasks that you may have waiting for you. While it might not be the most convenient, if you happen to be home during off-peak hours, you can save money on your monthly electricity bill by timing your tasks to these time frames.\nWhy do utility companies use time-of-use rates?\nUtility companies know when stress on the grid is going to be at its highest. To make sure the grid can serve all of these customers, they need to make sure that power plants are operational and meeting all of the demand. When demand increases, these companies may have to generate more electricity, which can cost more. They either need to generate that power in advance to meet the peak or purchase extra energy from other sources. That additional expense is passed on to the consumer through time-of-use rates, which charge you more when you use electricity during peak hours.\nWhen are peak hours?\nPeak hours vary depending on the time of year and region of the country. As a general rule, think of peak hours as the time during which most people are getting home from work for the day. This is when people are turning on their lights, firing up their TVs and settling into their homes for the night -- all of which require more electricity than usual.\nHere's an overview of peak and off-peak hours by Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific time zones. Note that select states may have different time of use schedules, be sure to select your state from the menu on your provider's website if applicable.\nSummer\n| Time zone | Peak hours | Off-peak hours |\n|---|---|---|\n| Eastern | 2-6 p.m. | 6-2 p.m. (next day), Weekends all hours |\n| Central | 1-5 p.m. | 5-1 p.m. (next day), Weekends all hours |\n| Mountain | 8 a.m.-11 p.m. | 11 p.m.-8 a.m. |\n| Pacific | 5-9 p.m. | 9-5 p.m. (next day) |\nWinter\n| Time Zone | Peak hours | Off-peak hours |\n|---|---|---|\n| Eastern | 6-10 a.m.; 6-10 p.m. | 10 a.m.-6 p.m.; 10 p.m.-6 a.m., Weekends all hours |\n| Central | 5-9 a.m.; 5-9 p.m. | 9 a.m.-5 p.m.; 9 p.m.-5 a.m., Weekends all hours |\n| Mountain | 7 a.m.-10 p.m. | 10 p.m.-7 a.m. |\n| Pacific | 6-10 a.m.; 5-8 p.m. | 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; 8 p.m.-5 a.m. |\nAdditional money-saving tips\nTypically, weekends are considered to be off-peak hours for the full day. This means that if you can time your energy-intensive tasks to Saturday and Sunday, you can typically save yourself some money when it comes to your monthly energy bill. Equipped with the knowledge of when peak hours occur and what times are considered to be off-peak hours, you can figure out how to time your use of major appliances to off-peak hours and keep your energy costs down. You can also consider purchasing tools like a solar battery that will provide you with an energy reserve so you don't have to draw from the grid during peak hours.\nYou can also use this knowledge to save more by minimizing the amount of electrical usage that you require during peak hours. You can unplug your appliances that you aren't using, make sure that your thermostat is set properly so your furnace is not running as much during peak hours, and utilize \"sleep\" mode on things like your computer and TV to make sure they aren't using unnecessary electricity that will cost you more. You may also want to consider using motion sensors in your home that can be equipped to interact with other electronic devices. For example, if you aren't home, there is no need for your lights to be on. Setting them to a motion sensor would ensure they won't turn on unless you're home and moving around."

      "text": "This summer has been scorching, delivering record breaking temperatures all across the US. Staying cool can be a pricey affair, especially if you're running AC units non-stop, but you can save a few dollars by setting your thermostat to the ideal temperature. By adjusting your thermostat settings, and using tricks like closing the blinds, or turning the lights off during the day, you can stay cool without blowing your budget out of the water. Here's what you need to know to save money on your cooling bills, even when the heat waves hit.\nThis is the ideal thermostat temperature for the summer\nIn the summer, the ideal temperature for your thermostat is 75 to 78 F when you're home, and 80 degrees when you're away or asleep, Dukes said. The DOE suggests 78 F during the day, 82 F when you're sleeping and 85 F when you're not home.\nMost importantly, you want to make sure your system can handle it. If you notice that the house never gets as cool as your thermostat setting, that probably means your system is not sized well for your home, and you might want to ease up on the cooling. You may also want to check on how well sealed your doors and windows are and how well insulated your home is.\nAir conditioners can only really cool your home to 15 to 20 degrees below the outdoor temperature, so setting the thermostat too low can result in your system running without being effective.\nRead more: Thinking of Buying a Portable AC? 5 Things You Need to Know Before You Do\nThis is the ideal thermostat temperature for the winter\nIn the winter, experts recommend that you set your thermostat to 68 degrees Fahrenheit when you're home, and 60 to 65 degrees when you're asleep or away.\nYou can set it higher, but that will reduce efficiency and lead to higher energy bills. It also depends on what the weather is like outside, Picard said. If it's 20 F outside, maybe don't set your thermostat to 80 F, he advised.\nThen there's the question of changing the temperature at night or when you're not home. The Department of Energy suggests you turn your thermostat back 7 to 10 degrees from its normal setting for 8 hours a day, saying that can save as much as 10% a year on heating and cooling.\nPicard suggested a smaller change: Lower the temperature by just four degrees when you're away or asleep. This means your system won't have to work quite as hard to get back to temperature..\n\"You don't want to have drastic changes in temperature,\" said Mahlie Dukes, franchise owner of WIN Home Inspection in Indiana.\nYou should also get to know your specific heating system. If you notice, for example, that your home never gets up to the temperature you set, that could be a sign that your system is improperly sized for your home, Picard says. And it's a cue to lower your thermostat setting so your HVAC won't constantly be working on overdrive.\nRead more: You Can Actually Save Money by Using Electricity at These Specific Times\nDoes it matter what type of HVAC you have?\nYes and no. The same general temperature recommendations apply regardless of the type of HVAC you have in your home, Picard says.\nBut your results may vary depending on the type and size of your system. Systems that are over- or under-sized for your home will run inefficiently, which leads to higher heating and cooling costs.\nThis is why Picard recommends that you have an HVAC professional inspect and clean your system annually. These pros can tell you how best to use your specific system for the best comfort and efficiency, he said.\nAvoid this common thermostat mistake\nSay your home is quite a bit colder than you'd prefer, and you want it to be perfect now. It may be 65 F inside and you may want it to be 70 F. Don't set it to 75 in the hopes that it will warm it up faster. Most HVAC units have two settings -- on or off -- and there's no getting to 70 F any more quickly.\nSet your thermostat to the temperature you want it to be. Setting to a warmer or cooler temperature than you actually desire in the hopes that will speed things along will just result in overcooling or overheating -- and overspending on your energy bills.\nIs your thermostat in the wrong place?\nYour thermostat knows how to set the temperature because it has a thermometer in it. So if your thermostat is in the wrong spot, it won't give you an accurate reading of the temp in your home.\nYou want to avoid having your thermostat in a location that sees frequent changes in temperature or humidity, like in the kitchen or the bathroom. If it's on an exterior wall, it might be more sensitive to outdoor temperature changes.\nInstead, try to position your thermostat on an interior wall in a location like your living room.\nAnd if you have a thermostat that supports external room sensors, having sensors in other locations, like a bedroom, can help you better regulate the temperature in the rooms where you spend most of your time.\nSave money by setting your thermostat\nReducing your energy bills this year doesn't have to be hard.\n\"There's a huge misconception that in order to be energy efficient you must be uncomfortable,\" Picard said.\nHomeowners can also look at areas beyond their thermostat. Investing in good insulation, for example, can greatly reduce how much strain you put on your HVAC system.\n\"You'd be surprised how much energy we blow right through our attics,\" Picard said.\nThat annual inspection and maintenance appointment can also help save you money. Picard said buildup within your HVAC system can lead to efficiency losses of up to 10% annually, which you'll see on your energy bill. That's why having it cleaned every year is a good move.\nAnd if you're in the market for a new HVAC system, it's a great time to take stock and make sure what you have fits your specific home."

      "text": "One simple twist of a dial can save you money on energy costs each time you take a shower or wash your dishes. It's not too good to be true.\nWater heating costs make up a surprisingly large household expense you might not often think about. It can account for 14% to 18% of an average utility bill, according to the Department of Energy. The water heater in my apartment is projected to cost me $489 each year.\nYou may have noticed that your gas and electric bills have been getting bigger. They're expected to keep trending in that direction.\nIf you're looking to save some cash, consider your water heater (and hot water consumption) to start. Here's what to know.\nFor more easy ways to cut costs, you can turn off the lights and also do laundry the cost-efficient way. And you could consider buying a smart thermostat or other energy-saving smart device.\nThe perfect temperature to set a water heater\nIf you're looking for a short answer, it's 120 degrees Fahrenheit (about 49 degrees Celsius). Many water heaters are set to 140 degrees F per factory specifications, but lowering the temperature, combined with other conservation tactics, can lead to energy savings of 4% to 22%, and up to $400, according to the Department of Energy. Even with the lower setting, you shouldn't have trouble getting your shower or dishwater hot enough.\nAnd the default setting of 140 F (60 C) may be going away. Recent installation manuals for major residential water heater manufacturers actually call for a starting temperature of 120 F (49 C).\nThe lower temperature might have more to do with avoiding scalding than saving energy. Since 140 F can cause second- and third- degree burns in five seconds, lowering your water heater's temperature can protect you from both financial and physical pain.\nChanging your water heater's thermostat should be a simple matter of turning a dial or entering a temperature. If you're unsure where your thermostat is located or how to read it, you can consult your owner's manual or talk to a licensed professional.\nAfter adjusting your water heater, the Department of Energy recommends running a simple test, since the device's own reading can be inaccurate. Once you've made the change, open the hot water tap furthest from your water heater and measure the temperature with a thermometer. If it doesn't match your target temperature, go adjust the thermostat and try again in two hours.\nWhat's the catch?\nThe Department of Energy lists a few further considerations if you're shifting your water heater temperature.\nSome dishwashers need water between 130 F and 140 F to operate optimally. So watch your dishwasher's performance after you shift the temperature. If your dishes aren't getting as clean, you may need to adjust it back.\nThere's also a small risk of water at 120 F growing Legionella bacteria, which causes Legionnaires' Disease. The Department of Energy calls it a small risk, but if you or someone you live with has a weaker immune system, you might want to raise the temperature a few degrees. The concern is generally for larger buildings, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Recent guidance from the CDC says that setting your water heater at a higher temperature can kill more germs, but that the risk of scalding, especially for young children and elderly adults, needs to be carefully monitored.\nOther ways to save hot water\nBesides the thermostat, you should pay attention to your water heater's pipes and tank too. Insulating the tank and pipes can save heat during times you're not using hot water. You can also install low flow faucets and shower heads, which will reduce the amount of hot water you use without impacting your experience.\nIf you're unsure about making any of these improvements on your own, check with your utility. Utilities may offer home energy efficiency fixes for free or a discounted price. In some cases, someone from the utility will come and install insulation and new shower heads for free.\nIn addition to adjustments to your home's hot water infrastructure, you can adjust your habits. Taking shorter showers, washing laundry on a cold setting, showering instead of bathing and using a dishwasher can all save hot water.\nMany water heaters have an expected life time of around 10 to 20 years. If you need to replace your water heater, look for an efficient one. You can start with Energy Star, which will help you find energy efficient Energy Star-certified water heaters and provides you with buying guides to decide on brand, energy source and type, like tankless or storage.\nYou'll have to balance the upfront costs of a water heater with the savings over time, but water heaters, like many appliances, typically have estimated energy costs disclosed before purchase.\nThe bottom line\nAn easy way to save money around the house -- sometimes up to hundreds of dollars per year -- is to lower your water heater's temperature and use less hot water. When it comes time to replace your water heater, energy efficient options can help and there are multiple models available to meet your needs.\nAfter you've taken a look at your water heater, rethink your thermostat placement or consider solar energy.\nMore ways to save around the home\n- Here Are 27 Ways to Cut Costs Around the House Now\n- This Is the Ideal Temperature to Set Your Thermostat to This Winter\n- Does Unplugging Your Appliances Actually Save You Money?\n- Tips for Renters to Save Energy and Money on Utility Bills\n- Save Money on Your Heating and Electric Bills With These 5 Easy Tricks"

      "text": "It's easy to lose track of time in the shower. Fifteen minutes feels like a mere five when you finally get to relax with a hot shower after a long day. But all good things come at a cost -- those luxurious showers can make a noticeable difference to your monthly water bill.\nIn fact, the US Environmental Protection Agency pegs showering as Americans' fourth largest household use of water. Now I'm not saying you can't indulge in a lengthier shower every so often (I certainly won't stop), but a few changes in your shower habits can add up to significant savings in the long run.\nShowering instead of bathing, or doing laundry and dishes the energy-efficient way, will keep your utility costs down. But shifting your shower habits or installing tech can save you even more money on energy and water. Just small changes like reducing the length and temperature of your daily shower can make for cheaper utility bills, no matter what shower head you're standing under. Keep reading to learn more about the direct connection between shower length and savings -- and tricks for how you can save on electricity and water.\nHow much time should you spend in the shower?\nThe average American spends about eight minutes in the shower. According to the EPA, a standard showerhead uses about 2.5 gallons of water per minute. Thus, the average American shower consumes about 20 gallons of water.\nWhile there is no magic amount of time to spend in the shower to help the planet, shaving just three minutes off an eight-minute shower time can help reduce your energy spending, as well as help to conserve water (about 7.5 gallons) overall. Even better, according to Healthline, the recommended maximum shower length for your skin is between 5 and 10 minutes. Sticking to five minutes ensures you're not overdoing it.\nSave money with shorter showers\nWhether you pay your water bill directly or it's rolled into a rent payment, shorter showers can save you money. You'll save money in water, gas or electricity for heating it, or both. The cost of your water heating system accounts for about 18% of your home's utility bill, the second largest utility expense, according to the Department of Energy.\nBetween your water bill and your electricity bill, there is potential for savings by spending less time in the shower. The amount you can save depends on your current water and electricity costs and how much you reduce your usage. The EPA estimates that switching to a more water-efficient showerhead can save you about $70 per year without even accounting for the savings of shorter showers.\nIt's also important to note that the benefits of spending less time in the shower aren't just about your pocketbook. Not only can taking shorter showers save money, but it can also save an incredible amount of water.\nThe standard showerhead uses about 2.5 gallons of water per minute. If you shaved 1 minute off your daily shower, you could save more than 900 gallons of water per year. And if every American did that, it would save billions (yes, billions) of gallons of water per year.\nRemember that while freshwater is considered a renewable resource, its supply is limited in some areas. And in some cases, nature's ability to replenish the water supply simply can't keep up with how quickly we use it. Everything you do to conserve water benefits not just your wallet, but everyone around you.\nReduce your shower energy consumption\nMonitor your energy usage\nMany of us likely don't realize how much time we spend in the shower, which can make it difficult to change our habits. As a starting point, consider monitoring your water usage. Simply timing your shower is a great place to start. You'll have a better idea of how much time you're spending in the shower and can set a goal for how much you'd like to reduce your shower time by.\nChange your showerhead\nAccording to the EPA, changing your shower head can save a lot of water. And when combined with shorter showers, the impact will be even greater.\nThe average standard showerhead uses about 2.5 gallons of water per minute. But a showerhead with the WaterSense label uses no more than 2 gallons per minute. So even without changing shower habits, the average American could reduce their water usage by 4 gallons per 8-minute shower. Low-flow showerheads are available from any home improvement store, but might also be available for a discount from your utility.\nDon't let the water run before your shower\nMany people are in the habit of starting the shower water and then letting it run for a few minutes to get to their desired temperature. You might even get sidetracked during this time or tackle another small task.\nOne simple way to reduce your energy usage is to wait until you're ready to step into the shower to turn it on. You could save yourself several gallons of water per day, and hundreds of gallons (or more) over the course of a year.\nTake colder showers\nYou can save even more money by taking colder showers. Because you pay for water heating, reducing your water heating needs will also cut your energy bill, even if just slightly.\nTake fewer showers\nAccording to the American Academy of Dermatology, there's no reason for most people to shower more than once per day, especially if you don't engage in physical activity that would cause you to sweat. If you shower more often, perhaps as a way to relax, try to reduce the number of showers you take.\nThe bottom line\nYou might be surprised just how much of your home's water and energy is used in the shower. While the average American only spends about 8 minutes in the shower, the gallons can really add up over time. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to reduce your energy usage and energy bills, simply by making a few small changes to your routine.\nMore ways to save money around the home\nThere's many expenses you have to worry about from monthly bills to rent and grocery budgets.

      "text": "American families are facing a lot at the moment: expensive groceries, fluctuating gas prices, back-to-school shopping, and an ongoing uptick in utility bill costs due to increased air conditioning useage this summer. These things might leave you wondering how you can save some money around the house.\nLowering your energy and water bills is one option, and your laundry room is a good place to start. Washing machines and dryers can use a lot of water and electricity (or gas, if you have a gas dryer), particularly if you have an older model in your home. If you typically wash weekly loads of towels, bedding and clothes, you might notice your monthly bills are consistently expensive. But there are several things you can do to help save money in the laundry room -- no handwashing or line-drying of clothes required.\nHere are some simple changes you can make to lower your washer and dryer's energy consumption. For more ways to save around the house, start by unplugging your appliances and consider what temperature you should set your thermostat to this summer to save big.\nWash your clothes on cold\nUnless a clothing label specifies a certain temperature, consider choosing the cold setting when starting a wash load. A full 90% of the energy used to wash a load goes into heating the water, according to Consumer Reports. So, you can save substantially on power usage when you use cold water.\nDon't worry about your clothes not getting clean in cold water, either. Most detergents are actually designed to work better in cold water. By choosing the cold setting you are actually getting cleaner clothes. An added benefit is cold water helps prevent color fading, as well.\nFor some loads, like towels and sheets, hot water is a better choice to kill bacteria. But everything else will be fine in cold water.\nSet your dryer to cooler heat\nA higher heat setting on your dryer uses more energy. Go with a lower heat setting (and a longer drying time) to use less energy.\nMake sure to use your dryer's cool-down option, too. It will finish up the load with the heat that is already in the dryer, instead of producing more.\nImprove your dryer's efficiency\nWe still hold that lowering the heat setting and slowing the drying time will save money, but the faster your clothes get dry, the less money you spend on electricity. Improving your dryer's efficiency can help make sure you don't have to run your still-damp clothes through the dryer a second time.\nFirst, make sure your dryer is cleaned out. The airways that carry humid hot air away from your clothes should be free of lint and debris. Clogged airways will keep the moist air trapped in the dryer drum with your clothes, making them take longer to dry. Every time you put in a load, make sure to clean out the lint trap thoroughly. Once a year, vacuum out the vents and the air hose coming out of the back of your dryer, too. Here are some tips on deep-cleaning your dryer.\nSecond, you can make the transportation of the humid air more efficient by shortening the accordion-like hose on the back of your dryer. A shorter hose can make your dryer work 20% faster because it doesn't need to push the moist air as far. If the hose doesn't have any excess length, move your dryer closer to the exit vent in the wall or floor, then trim the hose to a shorter length.\nThird, give your clothes an extra spin in the washer. Getting rid of excess water can speed up the drying process by as much as half.\nFinally, don't pack your dryer. Clothes need room to tumble around to get dry. A good rule of thumb is to only fill your dryer two-thirds of the way full.\nAlways run a full load of laundry\nWashers and dryers use about the same amount of electricity to wash a small load as they do a full load. So, it's more efficient to wait to do laundry until you have a full load, but remember -- don't over-stuff your dryer. Need to wash right away and don't have enough clothes and towels to fill up the basin? See this gallery for some household items you can clean in a washing machine that you may not have considered.\nConsider peak and off-peak hours\nIf your utility company charges extra for peak usage times, a simple change to your routine can help. Peak hours refer to certain times of the day where usage increases in your area. When that happens, a utility company with a time-of-use service will charge you extra to run your dishwasher or wash your clothes during peak hours. Using your non-essential appliances during off-peak hours instead can make a significant impact.\nContact your utility company to determine whether you're part of a time-of-use plan and when it charges extra for peak hours. You can also check our time-of-use energy explainer for more details.

      "text": "Certain sustainable actions like weatherstripping your home, buying all new energy-efficient appliances or insulating your attic can help decrease your energy usage and slash utility costs. But these projects can't apply to everyone since major changes to make a living space more energy-efficient aren't always possible for nonhomeowners. You can't exactly undergo big projects as an apartment dweller or renter since even small changes could result in a lease violation. The good news is that there are tricks and devices that can help you with longterm savings.\nWith gas and water bills and energy prices up 30% since 2022, it's important to think about energy savings. Turning off lights, setting your thermostat to an ideal temp and showering instead of bathing are some obvious ways to cut down, but there are some other tricks to save as a renter. Here are 10 practical ways to start saving now. For more, check out our picks for the top smart lights, smart thermostats and other energy-saving smart devices.\nRead also: You're Probably Doing Your Laundry Wrong and Your Energy Bill Is Suffering\n1. Switch your lighting\nWhen I moved into my apartment in Charlotte, North Carolina, one of the first things I did was install smart lighting. Why? It's easy and oh so effective. Just swapping out a few bulbs in your lamps or overhead lights can have a huge impact on your monthly invoices.\nPlus, smart lighting won't break the bank. You can find several LED smart bulbs from reputable brands that cost $20 apiece or less.\nAnd if you want to save big on your electricity bill but don't necessarily want all the smarts, standard LED bulbs are a great place to start. With or without the smarts, LED bulbs are far more efficient than old-school incandescents. In fact, LED bulbs use about 75% less than incandescent bulbs.\n2. Get the most out of your thermostat\nSmart thermostats that automatically adjust the temperature of your space are one of the most effective ways to save. Many newer apartments will come with smart thermostats already installed, but what if you don't have an apartment with a smart thermostat? You could always talk with your landlord about installing one yourself, but once a smart thermostat is installed, it will be difficult to remove it again when you inevitably move out.\nThe good news is a regular thermostat is also effective; Energy Star says a programmable model used correctly can add up to $180 in yearly savings. To save the most, make sure you set your thermostat to the ideal temperatures in both summer and winter.\nAccording to the US Department of Energy, the best technique for staying cool yet minimizing utility costs in summer is to keep your home warmer than usual when no one is home and then setting the temperature as high as comfortably possible when home. And it's similar for winter: It's best to keep your thermostat at 68 F for most of the day during the winter season and then you can turn the temperature down by between 7 and 10 degrees when away or asleep.\nHere's more tips to save energy and money with your thermostat.\n3. Do laundry the right way\nAs someone who does laundry two or three times a week, I'm always looking for ways to do laundry more efficiently so my monthly energy and water bills aren't staggeringly high. There are several tips to save in the laundry room that don't require hand-washing or line-drying your clothes.\nOne easy trick? Go cold. Simply washing your clothes in cold water can have a major impact on your savings since a whopping 90% of the energy used to wash a load goes into heating the water, according to Consumer Reports.\n4. Unplug devices and appliances\nBe wary of energy vampires (and no, I'm not talking about Edward Cullen). Energy vampires are devices and appliances that consume electricity when they're plugged in, but not in use. Certain items like toasters and phone chargers silently use up energy at all times and increase your bills, so simply unplugging these items can help you save.\nFind out exactly how much you can save by unplugging appliances here.\n5. Shower smarter\nThe average American household uses more than 300 gallons of water every day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Shortening your showers can help you save on your water bills, but you could also consider purchasing a low-flow showerhead. The EPA estimates that the average household can save $70 in annual water and energy costs by switching to a WaterSense-approved showerhead.\nLooking for more smart devices that can help you save on your utilities? Try these devices.\n6. Clean dishes the right way\nI've already mentioned how much water the average household uses. But did you know using that much water equates to about $83 per month on water costs? In addition to shortening showers, showering instead of bathing and using special showerheads, certain dishwashing practices can help you cut down too.\nIt may be hard to believe, but running your dishwasher uses less water and less energy than hand-washing. Cleaning dishes in the sink can use up to 27 gallons of water per load while an Energy Star certified dishwasher can use as little as 3 gallons per load. An Energy Star dishwasher can also use less than half the energy of washing dishes by hand.\nRead more: How Much Money Can Energy Star Appliances Save You?\n7. Look for leaks and other maintenance issues\nOne simple water leak, a constantly running toilet or a window not fully sealed can cost you big when it comes to monthly utilities. Every so often, scan your apartment for potential hazards or broken objects and then let your landlord know.\nPro tip: Also make sure you're replacing your air filter at least every three months to prevent your HVAC system from working harder than it needs to.\n8. Set your water heater to its ideal temperature\nThe Department of Energy says hot water heating can account for 14 to 18% of an average utility bill. Simply turning your water heater down to 120 degrees Fahrenheit from the default setting could save you up to $400.\nIf you living in a townhouse or another rental where you have access to the water heater, you can adjust the setting yourself. If you don't have access, ask your landlord or the maintenance crew for help.\nLearn more about your water heater and potential savings here.\n9. Calculate what you should be spending\nWhen paying monthly bills, it's important to be mindful about your state's average cost of utilities to make sure you're not overspending.\nIn the US, the average cost of utilities for renters is $240 a month. This estimate includes the basic utilities most apartment dwellers and renters are responsible for -- electricity, gas and water -- but that number will fluctuate based on location, usage and additional fees like trash, pest control, cable and internet costs.\nYou can use this interactive map to check the average cost of utilities in your state. You can also use an energy cost calculator to estimate your monthly residential energy usage.\n10. Talk to your landlord\nIf you try these tips and tricks, but still want to improve your residence's energy efficiency then there's no harm in approaching your landlord. You can ask if the property owner is willing to make some changes around the apartment or townhome like installing a smart thermostat or weatherstripping windows. If not, you can always follow up by asking if you can make the improvements yourself to be reimbursed later."

      "text": "When you leave home for a summer trip, you might be tempted to turn your air conditioning completely off to save some money on your electricity bill. But as outdoor temperatures soar, this can result in an overheated, humid home that you'll dread returning to.\nYou probably shouldn't turn your thermostat off, but luckily, you don't have to spend a fortune to keep your house cool. With a little help from technology ranging from window shades to smart thermostats, and some proactive planning, you can switch off the lights and enjoy your vacation without worrying about spiked energy bills when you return.\nBelow are seven tips for saving money on your home's AC when you go on summer vacation. With them you can kick back, relax and lower your utility bill. For more, explore the best portable air conditioners and best window air conditioners of the year.\n1. Rely on your smart thermostat\nSmart thermostats take the guesswork out of programming your home's heat and AC. When you go on your trip, enable the thermostat's vacation mode. Vacation mode sets the temperature for you, making it warmer while still running the AC at regular intervals. Some of these units even use motion sensors to detect when you are away and make temperature adjustments for you, to reduce energy costs while you're gone and have your home feeling comfortable again when you return.\nSetting a higher thermostat temperature while you're away can reduce your energy costs substantially. The US Department of Energy recommends setting your thermostat 7 to 10 degrees warmer for at least eight hours a day. Doing so nets you an energy savings of up to 10% off your cooling bill.\n2. Set manual thermostats higher\nIf you do not have a smart thermostat, you can maximize efficiency by setting your manual one 5 degrees higher than you normally would. Letting your house get too hot could cause some damage (think of your houseplants) and wipe out energy savings by making your fridge and freezer work that much harder. Sure, you will come back to a warmer home, but you'll also reduce your energy usage significantly. For more, explore the best energy-saving temperature for your thermostat.\n3. Keep your shades and blinds closed\nAnother way to trim energy costs is to keep your windows shaded when you are away. It helps to block out the sun's rays, which warms your home through heat gain. In turn, it prevents your air conditioner from kicking on more often, resulting in more energy usage.\nAim for medium-colored shades with white plastic backings. The Department of Energy states these shades can reduce heat gains by as much as 33%.\n4. Install window awnings\nAnother way to reduce the stress on your air conditioner is to add window awnings to your home. Window awnings are exterior shades, blocking the sun's rays from penetrating your windows and entering your home. Awnings can reduce solar heat gain up to 77% on west-facing windows and 65% on south-facing ones. The Department of Energy recommends choosing one that is tightly woven and opaque.\n5. Use a dehumidifier\nIf you live in an area with higher humidity, consider supplementing your air conditioner with a portable dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers work by pulling moist air in, absorbing the moisture through water-absorbing material, then circulating drier air back into your home. The result is a more comfortable home that won't rely on your air conditioner as much.\n6. Scan your HVAC\nBefore going on your trip, consider inspecting your home's HVAC unit. Technicians will examine your air conditioner to ensure everything is operating correctly. If they notice any problems, they can make repairs before you leave.\nIt is better to have issues addressed early instead of returning to an AC unit on the fritz. And, by having your system running in optimum condition, you can maximize its efficiency.\n7. Automate energy savings with your smart home\nIn the meantime, if you have a smart thermostat, consider integrating it into your smart home system. Many units pair with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant and more, permitting you to control your temperature, locks, and lights from one hub. This allows you to maximize energy efficiency and keep your home secure, even if you are thousands of miles away.\nDo you have a portable or window air conditioner?

      "text": "Smart home gadgets, from the Amazon Echo to the Ring camera doorbell, are all about convenience. When it comes to smart plugs, however, their benefits don't stop there. Smart plugs can secure your garage, remotely restart your router and even help you cut your energy bill. How can smart plugs save you money, you ask? It's simple, really. Smart plugs help reduce wasted energy while consuming a negligible amount of energy themselves.\nAny and all of the five tips listed below can help you cut energy consumption with a smart plug, but they're not the only way to lower your electricity bill. For more ways to save energy, consider switching to Energy Star appliances, using a smart thermostat, flipping the rotation of your ceiling fan or changing up how you do laundry.\nHow much energy do smart plugs use?\nOn its own, the average smart plug uses at most one, maybe two watts at any given time. Zero, like that of an unused standard outlet, would be ideal, but smart plugs require a small amount of electricity to stay connected to your Wi-Fi. Still, a smart plug uses only around 10 kWh over the course of a year.\nElectricity costs are different everywhere (and in some places, prices even fluctuate throughout the day), but my provider here in Fort Mill, South Carolina, currently charges a rate of 13 cents per kWh. So over the course of a year, if my smart plug stays plugged in all 8,760 hours, it'll add less than two bucks to my electricity costs for the year.\nGiven how little smart plugs will add to your energy consumption, it doesn't take much for them to save more than they use. Soon enough, that $10 to $20 smart plug will likely pay for itself, but it won't do all the work on its own. You'll need to use smart plugs strategically to maximize the savings. Here are five ways to do just that.\nGo Van Helsing on those energy vampire appliances\nThey're called \"vampire\" appliances or devices, and they're surely in your home, consuming energy even when they're powered down. With plug prongs like a vampire's fangs, televisions, desktop computers and their monitors, gaming consoles and other devices will continuously leech energy after you've hit the power button.\nVampire devices are responsible for around 10% of total energy consumption in the average household, easily adding $100 to $200 to yearly electricity costs. Unplugging vampire devices when they're not in use is an effective way to combat waste, but the task isn't always convenient and can be easily forgotten.\nSmart plugs can save you the trouble of remembering to unplug things and running all over the house to do it. Set a timer for your smart plugs to turn off automatically, or turn them off manually via the app on your phone. When turned off, smart plugs cut all power to whatever's plugged into it, so turning the smart plug off is essentially as effective as unplugging the device from the outlet.\nTurn off the lights you left on, from anywhere\nWith a smart plug, you can hit the lights, wherever you may roam. It's alright if you don't get that Metallica reference; the point still holds true. Smart plugs enable you to check a device's on/off status and switch it accordingly from virtually anywhere. That means if you left the house for work, or a two-week vacation, you can check to see if you left any plugged-in lights on and turn them off remotely.\nA left-on light won't waste the same level of electricity as a vampire device might, but every little bit adds up. If you can reduce your energy consumption by turning off a couple lights from five or 500 miles away, why not do it?\nThe same goes not just for lights but anything that may have been left on, whether you're home or away. Use your smart plug to turn off any fans or heaters that may be needlessly running in another room, or devices like electronic toothbrushes and earbuds that don't need to be charged 24/7. Also consider turning an indoor security camera off when you're home or a nursery cam when you're away and don't need the monitoring.\nMonitoring your energy consumption makes it easier to save\nMost smart plugs, and specifically the accompanying app, come with an energy-monitoring feature to help you keep track of how much electricity your plugged-in devices are using at any given time.\nUse your smart plug to get a gauge of how much energy your household items use. You may be surprised by how uneconomical that space heater is and opt for an extra layer and a blanket instead. You may also find that even low-usage devices such as a lamp could benefit from minor changes like using a more efficient light bulb. Either way, your smart plug is keeping you conscious of how much electricity you're using.\nRead more: A Space Heater Could Save You Hundreds on Heating This Winter. Here's How\nSome smart plugs make it even easier to monitor and rein in energy consumption. For example, the Emporia Smart Plug, one of our favorite smart plugs, offers a setting to automatically turn devices off if they hit a set level of energy use.\nSet it and forget it\nEver heard of the smart home automation tool called IFTTT? IF This Then That (no, that TTT doesn't stand for \"trust the tech,\" but it could!) controls and combines the automated actions your connected smart devices perform in response to other devices.\nFor example, if your smart thermostat detects a rise in temperature, you could set a compatible smart plug to automatically turn a fan on and then off again once the temperature drops back within a set range. Or, you could set lights to automatically turn off when Alexa notices you've left the room, effectively doing the job of conserving energy for you.\nEven if you don't take full advantage of the IFTTT capabilities, your smart plug is sure to come with settings to schedule devices to turn on and off at certain times. So, if you accidentally leave a light or the TV on when you go to bed, your smart plug can turn it off for you when scheduled to do so.\nWork around your electricity provider's peak hours\nDemand can have an impact on what you pay for electricity, and demand is often at its highest at certain times, often known as on-peak hours, during the day. If possible, use your smart plug to coordinate energy consumption around these hours to save money where you can.\nObviously, there's no avoiding the use of some appliances or devices during on-peak hours, but some could operate just the same no matter the time of day. The dishwasher, battery chargers and electric vehicle chargers, for instance, could be scheduled to be active only during off-peak hours. You won't be using as much energy during those popular on-peak hours, but that's OK; you'll be saving money.\nThat's it for our list of ways to save money with a smart plug. For more money-saving tips and home hacks, check out our list of year-round cost-cutting tips for around the house. Plus, a smart plug isn't the only smart home gadget that can save you money.

      "text": "When the summer heat kicks in, turning up the air conditioner is an easy choice, but the comfort comes at a cost. With electricity prices climbing and inflation stretching budgets, a recent CNET survey found that almost 80% of Americans feel stressed by high energy bills. The good news is you can stay cool without spending as much.\nOne of the simplest ways to use less energy is also one of the easiest to forget. Turning off the lights when you leave a room cuts down on heat from bulbs, which means your air conditioner doesn't have to work as hard. Over the course of a summer, that small change can make a real difference on your bill.\nPair that habit with other smart moves like closing blinds during the hottest part of the day, running ceiling fans the right way, and unplugging electronics you're not using. With a few small adjustments, you can keep your home cooler and reduce your energy costs without sacrificing comfort.\nWhy should you turn off the lights?\nYou've probably been told repeatedly about the importance of conserving energy, but you might be wondering why it's so important.\nFirst, reducing your energy usage by turning off your lights is an excellent way to reduce your carbon footprint. Electricity generation is one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. By turning off your lights when you aren't using them, you can do your part to reduce carbon emissions and therefore help the environment.\nSecond, reducing your home's energy usage doesn't just help the environment. It also helps your wallet. Turning off lights when you don't need them can help reduce your electricity bills. You'll also extend the life of your light bulbs, which will save you money as well.\nBuying a smart lightbulb can help you conserve energy by setting your lights to go on and off at certain times, so no more falling asleep with all the lights left on overnight. The Wiz tunable white LED smart bulb is CNET's pick for the best white-light smart bulb.\nHow much money can you save?\nThe amount you can save on your electricity bill by turning off your lights depends on the type of light bulb you use. You can figure your potential savings using the light bulb's wattage.\nLet's say you have a light bulb that's 40 watts, meaning in one hour, the bulb will use 0.04 kWh. Then, you can use your electricity price \u2014 which you can find on your most recent utility bill \u2014 to figure out how much you'll save for that hour. In the case of the 40-watt bulb, if you pay an electricity rate of 10 cents per kWh, your savings by turning that bulb off for one hour would be 0.4 cents.\nIt's easy to see that number and think it's simply not worth it to turn off your lights more often. After all, what difference does 0.4 cents make? First, remember that the estimate is for a 40-watt bulb. If you have higher-wattage light bulbs, the savings will be greater. Next, that estimate uses an energy price of 10 cents per kWh, but in many areas, the price of electricity may be higher than that.\nFinally, our estimate looked at the savings of turning off one bulb for one hour. You likely have many light bulbs in your house, and there are far more than just one hour in a month. So when you calculate the savings of turning off all of your light bulbs for many more hours per month, your savings will increase significantly.\nWhen should you turn off the lights?\nYou can save money by turning off your lights and fans whenever you don't need them. During the spring and summer, it's a good idea to check in on the peak and off-peak energy hours in your area. Many providers use a time-of-use electricity plan where energy costs rise during peak hours, or hours where the grid is facing higher demand, and lower during off-peak hours. These hours change depending on the seasons, so transitioning between seasons is a good time to check when you're paying the most for energy.\nDuring peak hours, usually during the afternoons in the summer, while in the early morning and in the evenings after sunset during winter, it's helpful to be especially diligent in turning off lights and other electronic appliances when you leave a room to cut down on your energy bill. During the spring and summer, daylight saving time is in effect, which means more daylight and less need to have the lights on in your home.\nA small change can yield big savings\nTurning off the lights and other electric appliances when you aren't using them is one of the most basic steps you can take to reduce your energy usage and save money on your electricity bill. Even a small change can add up to big energy savings and help reduce your carbon footprint.\nMore money-saving tips for you\n- Energy Star Appliances: Can They Really Save You Money?\n- Change Your Water Heater's Set Temperature and Save Money\n- Can You Actually Save Money by Showering Instead of Bathing?\n- How to Lower Your Air Conditioning Bill While You're on Vacation\n- Your Fan Is Probably in the Wrong Place (and Room Temperatures Suffer)\n- The Best Energy-Saving Smart Home Devices to Help You Save on Utility Bills\n- Energy Vampires: What They Are and Why Unplugging Them Can Save You Money"

It's no secret that cooling your whole house or apartment can put a serious dent in your wallet thanks to high energy costs, but summertime is also a time when water bills can spike too.\nJust think, you're probably taking more showers since merely stepping outside can cause intense sweating -- not to mention how soaked you'll be if you're going for a jog or mowing the lawn. That means it'll be important to conserve water usage where you can for some additional savings.\nBetween showers, sinks, toilets, dishwashers, washing machines and yard work, the average American household uses more than 300 gallons of water every day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Altogether, this equates to an average of $1,000 per year (or just over $83 a month) on water costs. Your typical bill might be lower or higher than this, depending on your location, water usage habits, water-saving tech and other factors.\nCutting back on your water usage is a smart way to slash monthly expenses this summer. You can always set your thermostat to the right temperature, turn off the lights and unplug appliances, but making sure to use less water when possible will provide another layer of energy savings. In this article, we'll explain how to change your habits to conserve water and save money.\nSearch for water leaks around the house\nIf you've noticed you're being charged more on your water bill each month (but haven't changed your habits), a leak may be to blame.\nBefore changing your water consumption habits or investing in new appliances, it could be worth spending some time checking for leaks around the house. Puddles are the biggest sign that something isn't right, although you might be able to catch a drip as well. Look for pools of water around your toilets, under sinks and the dishwasher, and around your washing machine.\nIf you spot any leakage or water spots, make sure to address the problem right away (whether that means fixing it yourself or calling a plumber) to prevent any more unnecessary costs on your water bill. You can also install smart leak sensors to help detect future water leaks.\nMake your faucets more efficient\nIf you have older faucets, adding an aerator will make them more efficient, saving you water and money. Aerators are small, circular objects that screw on to your faucet head and infuse air into the water stream. As a result, the water is compacted and creates a more consistent stream -- all while reducing water usage by 30%.\nIf you're willing to take on a bigger DIY project, you can replace your old faucet with a new, WaterSense-certified faucet. These products are certified by the EPA and guaranteed to use at least 20% less water than older models.\nUse less water every time you flush\nIn a typical home, toilets account for almost 30% of water consumption, factoring in only indoor appliances. There are several different ways to reduce the amount of water that your toilet uses, including switching to a low-flow toilet. According to the EPA, these water-efficient toilets can help your family save up to $140 per year.\nBut if you're looking for a cheaper option, you can add a weighted plastic bottle to your toilet tank. The bottle will take up space in the tank that's usually filled with water, so less water is wasted with each flush.\nTo do this, fill a half-gallon bottle with sand and place it inside the tank, making sure it sinks to the bottom. Replace the lid of the tank, and continue to use the toilet as you normally would.\nRun your dishwasher (but wait until it's full)\nYou may be surprised to learn that running your dishwasher is actually more water-efficient than handwashing the dishes -- as long as you're running a full load of plates and utensils. On top of that, if you have an Energy Star dishwasher, it can save up to 5,000 gallons of water each year when compared to washing dishes by hand.\nIf you have a newer dishwasher, you can skip prerinsing your dishes to save an extra 6,000 gallons of water per year. As long as you throw out the large pieces of food, most modern dishwashers can actually handle the rest, scrubbing your plates nice and clean.\nSwitch up your shower habits\nThe typical American spends 8 minutes in the shower, which equates to 20 gallons of water per shower. If everyone in your household makes an attempt to take fewer or shorter showers, you could feasibly save hundreds of gallons of water each month.\nYou can save even more water on your showers by installing a water-efficient shower head. In fact, the EPA estimates that the average family can save $70 in annual water and energy costs by switching to a WaterSense-approved shower head.\nRead more: Skip Taking a Bath and Save Big Money\nYes, little changes can make a big difference\nAs you've probably noticed by now, the best ways to save on your water bill involve using less water and switching to more efficient appliances. From installing a faucet aerator to shortening your showers, each of these small changes will help you become smarter about your water usage, which benefits your wallet and the planet.\nMore money-saving tips\n- Peak and Off-Peak Energy Explainer: Save Money, Find the Cheapest Time to Use Electricity\n- 27 Practical and Easy Ways to Cut Costs Around Your Home Now\n- Try This Easy Ceiling Fan Hack to Save on Money and Energy Bills\n- Energy Star Appliances: Can They Really Save You Money?\n- Weatherstripping Can Lower Your Utility Bills This Winter\n- The Best Energy-Saving Smart Home Gadgets to Help You Save on Utility Bills\n- 5 Money-Saving Tips to Reduce Your Heating Bill This Winter"

      "text": "Finding the perfect streaming device isn\u2019t just about connecting to your favorite shows, movies and sports; it\u2019s also about how the experience fits into your lifestyle. Whether you need lightning-fast navigation, cinematic sound with Dolby Atmos compatibility or crystal-clear 4K HDR visuals, there\u2019s a device for you \u2013 especially handy if your older smart TV isn\u2019t keeping up with the latest streaming platforms. We\u2019ve spent hours testing every major streaming device and smart TV system on the market. From Roku and Google to Amazon Firesticks and Apple TV, we\u2019ve dug deep to bring you honest, detailed insights. Stick with us as we guide you through the best streaming devices available today.\nOur Picks\nSTREAMING PLAYER DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $30 (save $20)\n- $35 (save $6)\n- $84 (save $16)\n- $100 (save $40)\nWhat is the best streaming device overall?\nWe prefer Roku's content-agnostic approach, ease of use, large app library and excellent search functionality over those from other companies. We've found that the Roku Express 4K Plus is usually the cheapest Roku that offers 4K HDR streaming, and is therefore the best streaming device to buy. The Express 4K Plus lacks Dolby Vision support, but we've found that this usually isn't a deal-breaker, as Dolby Vision only works on some TVs (and notably not Samsung). Additionally, we don't think that Dolby Vision looks any better than regular HDR and isn't generally worth extra money.\nThat said, there are times during the year when the Roku Express 4K Plus is not our top pick. This occurs when the Streaming Stick 4K is on sale and is cheaper than the Express 4K Plus. The Streaming Stick 4K offers all the same functionality of the Express 4K Plus, but includes Dolby Vision support -- which is why it's typically more expensive. We don't think this addition is worth the premium price, but it certainly shouldn't prevent you from grabbing the Streaming Stick 4K if it's the cheaper of the two.\nBest streaming devices of 2025\nPros\n- Super simple, app-based menus\n- Cheaper than 4K HDR rivals\n- Fast and responsive\n- Ethernet support (with third-party adapter)\n- Dolby Atmos supported on some apps\nCons\n- No Dolby Vision support\n- Roku's voice assistant remains weaker than rivals from Amazon, Apple and Google\nRoku is our favorite streaming system, with the most streaming app options, the simplest streaming platform interface and the best search. It also has a content-agnostic platform that doesn't push any one media streaming service provider, like Amazon Prime Video or Apple, over another. The Express 4K Plus streaming media player is one of the cheapest streaming TV options with 4K HDR. (Even if your current TV doesn't support those formats, your next one probably will.) Thanks to the AirPlay update, this Roku device is one of the least expensive ways to connect your iPhone or other Apple device to your TV. It is cheaper than the company's Streaming Stick 4K Plus and other 4K HDR streaming devices, and it's our top pick for best streaming device overall.\nPros\n- Robust app and Dolby Vision support\n- Simple interface\n- Good search for TV and movies\nCons\n- Costs $10 more than the nearly identical Express 4K Plus\n- No support for gaming services\n- No smart home control\n- Voice assistant remains limited\n- Does not support Dolby Atmos\nThe Roku Streaming Stick 4K features the same simple interface, large app selection and impressive search function found on all Roku devices, but also offers Dolby Vision support. Along with a stick-like design, Dolby Vision HDR is the main difference between the Streaming Stick 4K and the Express 4K Plus, and is ostensibly why the Streaming Stick 4K is more expensive than its sibling. While we think the Streaming Stick 4K is a great device, we're just not sold on the Dolby Vision upgrade -- mostly because we generally don't think that it provides a major image quality upgrade over standard HDR. But if Dolby Vision is important to you, this device will not disappoint.\nPros\n- Useful remote\n- Large app selection\n- Makes excellent use of the Google Assistant\n- Ties in well with YouTube TV, Google Photos\nCons\n- Can lag when switching apps or using voice\n- Assistant doesn't always give the best option to play back content\n- No full Dolby Atmos\nThe Chromecast with Google TV 4K isn't quite as good as the Roku Express 4K Plus, but it comes closer than any other device on the market. Chromecast outdoes Roku by adding Dolby Vision compatibility, but its biggest smart device strength is Google Assistant voice search, which works well for finding stuff to watch. We also like the impressive integration with other Google services such as Google Photos and YouTube TV. The interface is more evolved-looking than Roku, but ultimately we prefer Roku's simpler approach, no-nonsense search results and lower price. That said, the new Chromecast is a better smart streaming device choice for those already living in Google's world.\nPros\n- Fast loading times\n- Latest playback standards offered\n- Amazon ecosystem capabilities\nCons\n- Only slightly improved from previous model\nLike its predecessor, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2023) loads apps almost immediately, and navigating around the system is swift and smooth. Even better, the Max offers Wi-Fi 6E and nearly all the latest playback standards, including Dolby Vision. For people hooked into the Amazon ecosystem, the new Ambience mode can include up-to-date delivery information on your TV screen. Though it's only a little better specified than the original Max, the second gen is now officially the best Fire Stick on the market today.\nPros\n- Cheaper starting price than previous Apple TV 4K\n- Speedy performance\n- Modern, A15 Bionic chip\n- Robust app and format support, integration with other Apple services\nCons\n- Still a lot more expensive than rival, capable streamers\n- No noticeable apps or experiences to take advantage of new chip\n- TV gaming on Apple Arcade remains lacking\n- Ethernet is just on the priciest model\nThe 2022 Apple TV 4K starts at $129, $50 less than its previous version. It also has a faster A15 Bionic processor under the hood and an updated Siri Remote that swaps out the proprietary Lightning connector for USB-C. If those changes sound minor, that's because they are. When using the device, it's hard to see any real difference compared to last year's model.\nBut it continues to be a good choice for those who want an Apple device to use Apple Arcade for gaming or take full advantage of their Apple One subscription bundles. Video purists will appreciate its flexible HDR and TV calibration feature.\nFor most people, however, Apple's venerable remote control streaming device just isn't worth the money, especially now that Roku has nearly all the major apps and AirPlay. If you really want Dolby Vision, you can find that on the Roku Streaming Stick 4K at a fraction of the price.\nPros\n- Compact, easy to set up and affordable\n- Excellent dialogue reproduction\n- Tried and true Roku experience\nCons\n- Lacks bass in movies and music\nSoundbars with streaming onboard may be a relatively recent development, but Roku's new Streambar nails it. It has the Roku interface we know and love, complete with 4K HDR with improved sound for any TV, especially dialog. It's smaller and more affordable than its predecessor, the Roku Smart Soundbar, but we think the new Streambar media streamer device makes more sense for most people.\nPros\n- Cutting-edge streaming with 4K AI upscaling, Dolby Vision\n- Native Android, cloud gaming and Steam Link options\n- Improved Android TV interface with Google Assistant\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Some issues understanding voice commands\n- Slower than Roku to launch Netflix\nSure, it's an expensive media device -- and that's before adding a game controller -- with 8GB of storage and 2GB RAM, compared to 16GB of storage and 3GB RAM, but if you want a jack-of-all-trades video streaming player, the Shield is it. In addition to 4K streaming and HDR, it offers a robust library of games, both console-level and Android TV, Steam Link, built-in Google Assistant complete with smart home control, NAS access, Plex server capability, HD HomeRun integration and much more.\nFactors to consider when choosing a streaming device\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to consider how much you're willing to spend on a new streaming device. Higher-end devices can cost well over $100, like the Apple TV 4K, the Roku Streambar, and the NVIDIA Shield TV. But if your budget is a little tighter, there are plenty of simpler yet still very effective streamers which are priced as low as $30.\nBrand compatibility\nYou'll want to consider the other brands in your home's ecosystem before choosing a product. If you're already an Apple loyalist, you might opt for the Apple TV to round out your supply of iPhones and HomePods. Or, if you're already an Amazon Prime subscriber, the Fire Stick may be your best option. Google and Chrome junkies may prefer to keep it in the family with several Chromecast and Google options to complete their ecosystem. In any case, keeping it \"in the family\" may be your best bet in terms of picking your streaming device.\nUse cases\nConsider what exactly you'll be using your streaming device for. Are you looking for extra streaming services beyond what your TV already offers? Are you looking for a powerful device which you are also able to game on? Make sure your use cases align with the capabilities of the streaming device you choose.\nDisplay hardware and connectivity\nAsk yourself how you'll be integrating the streaming device into whatever environment you're buying for. Most devices offer both HDMI connectivity and Wi-Fi, though wireless connectivity issues may force some people to use Ethernet, for example. Consider whether you're willing to add wires to your setup to let your streaming device run as smoothly as possible.\nHow we test streaming devices\nEvery streaming device we review receives hours of hands-on testing. Typically, this involves installing the device on multiple TVs, evaluating the setup process, adding popular streaming channels and using the product as if it were our own. We use all of the major features available on the platform and note how they stack up against the competition. To do this, we hook rival streaming devices to the same TV so we can switch back and forth easily to compare the experiences.\nOur metrics that we look at to rate a device include: hardware design and features, remote capabilities and design, overall platform ease-of-use, effective layouts and design, search capabilities, privacy settings, the number of apps and their performance, and the overall speed and reliability of the system.\nOther streaming devices we've tested\nRoku Ultra LT: This is technically the cheapest current device with Roku's streaming system and an Ethernet port. The savings compared to the actual, non-LT Ultra isn't much, however, and it lacks that device's slick extras like Dolby Vision, programmable keys, fast app launching and the remote finder.\nJubileeTV: JubileeTV's modus operandi is to simplify streaming TV access for aging Americans. With technology constantly advancing and an overwhelming amount of content available, older viewers can feel lost. JubileeTV provides a familiar viewing experience for seniors to enjoy their favorite programming while staying connected to family and loved ones. Learn more about the simplified streamer in our full JubileeTV review.\nRoku Ultra (2024): The Roku Ultra (2024) has seen some upgrades including a new caching system for faster loading times and a new voice remote with USB-C charging. If you already have an Ultra, then simply buy the new Voice Remote Pro 2nd Edition instead. Read CNET's full review of the Roku Ultra (2024).\nFire TV Stick 4K: The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K debuted in 2018 and is still around today. While we generally think it's worth it to upgrade to the Max, the original Fire TV Stick 4K is still a good choice for those who want 4K streaming without paying for the latest bells and whistles, namely Wi-Fi 6 and blazing-fast speed.\nFire TV Stick Lite: The Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite is our favorite budget streaming device, besting the Roku Express. The Lite trounces the Express in features-for-the-money. This Fire TV's biggest advantage is a remote with built-in voice search and control powered by Alexa. The cheapest Roku with a voice remote is the Express Plus 4K, which uses Roku's more basic voice system, not Alexa. The Fire Stick's remote also doesn't need line of sight to work. If you want to spend as little as possible on a streaming player, learn more about the Fire TV Stick Lite in our full review."

      "text": "Whether it's a smart light bulb, a smart thermostat or a water-saving, low-flow smart sprinkler, there are plenty of devices on the market that can help you save money on energy, water and electricity.\nPlus, if you use these devices in addition to turning off lights when you leave the room, setting your thermostat to the ideal temperature, spending less time in the shower and unplugging appliances, you'll start to see real savings on your monthly utility bills this summer and beyond. Here are a few devices we think you should try out.\nSmart thermostats\nIf this were Family Feud, smart thermostats would be the number one answer on the board when it comes to energy savings -- and for good reason. These connected thermostats manage your HVAC system with several extra features you won't get in an unconnected model.\nYou can set temperature thresholds appropriate for the season, as well as Home and Away temperatures that adjust automatically based on whether your mobile device is present via location data. If you can only do one thing to make your home smarter and more energy conscious, a thermostat is a great choice.\nNot only is this thermostat available at an amazing value, but it's also our favorite smart thermostat of all. The Amazon Smart Thermostat is the least expensive smart thermostat CNET has tested and is still packed with a plethora of perks: touchscreen interface, a sleek design and Energy Star-certified, saving an average of $50 on a yearly energy bill.\nAnd, of course, it works via the Alexa app and with Alexa voice commands. You will need a compatible Alexa-enabled smart speaker or smart display to use voice commands, but you don't have to enable an Alexa skill since this is an Amazon-branded product. Read our full Amazon Smart Thermostat review here.\nGoogle Nest is in its third round of smart thermostats. The third-gen Nest Learning Thermostat boasts a larger display, a better resolution and a far-field sensor for viewing time and temperature from farther away than previous models.\nThis thermostat works with Google Assistant and Alexa for voice commands and smart-home integration. You can also pick up a battery-powered temperature sensor (sold-separately) to pinpoint the climate in your most frequently used rooms.\nLike Google Nest, Ecobee has continued to gradually improve its smart thermostats. The latest, the Ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control, includes one temperature sensor.\nThat price is high, but Ecobee added features like a nicer looking glass finish, support for 5GHz connectivity, better Alexa integration with digital microphones, improved speaker quality and a redesigned temperature sensor.\nThis is the thermostat for you if you're a fan of Alexa, because Amazon's smart assistant is built right in.\nLights\nWith or without the smarts, LED bulbs are far more efficient than old-school incandescents. If you want to save big on your electric bill, LED bulbs are a great place to start. If you're ready to jump into smart bulbs, there are plenty of affordable options out there these days.\nUse a schedule to make sure the right lights are on or off during the day. If you don't need a schedule, you can still use Alexa and Google Assistant integrations to turn off that kitchen light you forgot about from your phone or smart speaker from anywhere in your house or where you have an internet connection.\nYes, the Wyze bulb is the cheapest smart bulb available and yes, it's one of the best smart lights available, too. For just $32, you can purchase a 4-pack and proceed to bask in the glow of dirt-cheap smart light all around your home.\nPlus, these bulbs come with a number of excellent features: Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant compatibility, a full spectrum of white-light color temperature settings and unbeatable brightness. Read our Wyze Bulb review.\nPhilips Hue Starter Kit\nPhilips Hue bridges and bulbs still set the standard for reliable, scalable smart lighting. A starter kit with two white bulbs and the required Hue bridge costs $70 (you could also opt for the $100 four-bulb and bridge package). From there, you can add bulbs for as little as $15 each.\nThe Hue app allows you to control these bulbs remotely, set schedules, create scenes and more. Read our complete guide to Philips Hue for a deeper dive into this robust collection of smart lights.\nSmart plugs\nLike smart lights, smart plugs can automatically turn on and off on a schedule, monitor energy consumption and create scenes. Plug in any gadget or small appliance you'd normally use in a wall outlet, and a smart plug will bring it online. If you're specifically interested in conserving power, not just automation, be sure to select a plug that includes energy monitoring.\nEufy Smart Plug Mini\nMany smart plugs don't offer true energy monitoring. The Eufy Smart Plug Mini brings your daily and monthly reports on energy consumption for whatever device it's powering. There are also scheduling, timing and customization options through a companion app.\nThe app is easy to set up, simple to use and comes with every feature you would need to control a gadget or small appliance. You won't need a hub or bridge to get started, just a solid 2.4GHz wireless connection. However, you also won't get the additional side USB charger some plugs offer, and it doesn't work with HomeKit.\nThis isn't CNET's favorite smart plug, but it has great energy consumption settings. For anyone who can live without energy consumption details, we'd recommend the smaller TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini.\nThis $12 outdoor smart plug by Wyze boasts some excellent features -- especially for the price. Like many smart plugs, the Wyze Plug Outdoor is weather resistant, can easily control your connected devices from anywhere, and incorporates Alexa and Google Assistant functionality. But what separates the Wyze Plug Outdoor from other plugs on the market is its Energy Monitoring feature.\nThe Wyze Plug Outdoor monitors the energy used to power the connected devices -- and it will even send you notifications if the consumption exceeds certain levels and will track your historical energy usage in the Wyze app.\nMotion sensors\nIf you already own smart lights or are ready to set up your first bulbs, consider adding a compatible motion sensor. A good motion sensor, like the options below, can turn lights on or off. You'll be able to turn on a hallway or bathroom light when someone walks by at night or turn off all the living room lights when no motion has been detected.\nThe Philips Hue Motion Sensor works with the Hue line of smart lights via the Hue app for iOS or Android. What's nice about this sensor is that Hue has included a daylight sensor. That means the device can detect when there's still enough daylight to light a space and make sure there aren't lights on unnecessarily.\nThe motion sensor runs on two AAA batteries and you can pair up to a dozen of them with your Philips Hue Bridge. Mount in a variety of ways, including an option magnet included in the box.\nSmartThings Motion Sensor\nThe SmartThings system isn't for everyone. You'll really need to buy into it to get the full benefits. That means a $70 hub, this $25 motion sensor and any compatible bulbs and devices you'd like to turn on or off.\nThe motion sensor sits on a ball joint, so you can move it around for the perfect angle. As with the Hue sensor, it can turn lights on or off based on motion or lack thereof. With all SmartThings all the time, you can get a pretty good setup going. The system is also compatible with Google Assistant and Alexa for voice commands.\nSmart sprinklers\nSpring is coming upon us quickly and that means lawn care is probably back to the top of your to do list. Smart sprinklers are one way to save water when your grass gets thirsty. With connectivity and management apps you can schedule watering and even automatically delay it if rain is in the forecast. If water consumption in your home has gone up now that there are more people there during the day, putting some smarts around your lawn watering is a great way to help minimize usage.\nRachio 3 replaces the controller for your in-ground sprinklers. It's a great way to keep your lawn maintenance on a routine. Rachio watches your local weather, too. If you normally water your lawn on Tuesday mornings, but there is a forecasted thunderstorm this Tuesday, Rachio won't run. That upgrade will keep you from using water when you don't need it.\nRachio 3 also has a flow meter built in that not only knows exactly how much water your lawn is getting, but will shut down the sprinkler if a leak is detected.\nThis budget smart sprinkler system has an app that will watch the weather and schedule the sprinklers for you. You can also control sprinklers with Alexa voice controls through B-Hyve's Alexa skill.\nSure, the large dial, big buttons and clunky LCD display might not scream \"smart home chic,\" but for an affordable outdoor device, the Orbit B-Hyve gets the job done well.\nSmart home products make our lives easier, more automated and in the case of these devices more energy efficient. Adding just a smart thermostat can make a big difference. Smart lights and plugs are a great way to go, too. No matter how you start your energy-saving smart home, the benefits are sure to add up.\nMore money-saving tips:\n- Yes, an Air Fryer Can Save You Money on Your Energy Bill\n- Try This Easy Ceiling Fan Hack to Save on Money and Energy Bills\n- You Can Actually Save Money By Using Electricity at These Specific Times\n- Skip Taking a Bath and Save Big Money"

      "text": "Your appliances and electronics could be using electricity even when they are turned off. Learn how to reduce your costs from standby power.\nFebruary 9, 2022Did you know that if your TV, computer and other appliances are plugged in, they are quietly draining electricity - all day, every day - even when they are turned off? Electric power consumed by products when they are switched off or in a standby mode is known as standby power. While it may not be readily noticed, standby power is a big issue. It accounts for 5 percent to 10 percent of residential energy use, and could cost the average U.S. household as much as $100 per year.\nHere are three easy tips that you can take action on right now to reduce your standby power loads and save money.:\n- Use a Power Strip with Switches. You can use a power strip with on/off switches to plug in your appliances. Surge protector power strips typically have such switches and help protect your appliances and electronics If you plug all of your products into a power strip and flip off the power strip when these items are not in use, they are truly off.\n- Unplug Your Products. Another sure way to reduce your standby power load is to just unplug your products. Now, there are some products that you will want to keep plugged in, such as the digital alarm clock in your bedroom or the refrigerator. But there are many appliances that you may not need to have plugged in, such as a toaster oven.\n- Consider using ENERGY STAR\u00ae products. Many ENERGY STAR products are energy efficient and have lower standby power than comparable non-ENERGY STAR products.\nSo, there you go -- three simple ways to reduce or eliminate your standby power, and save some money too!\nSubscribe to receive updates from Energy Saver, including new blogs, updated content, and seasonal energy saving tips for consumers and homeowners."

      "text": "When it comes to water temperature, a lot of us are like Goldilocks: We don't want it too hot or too cold, but just right. What you might not realize is that there are real ramifications for having the wrong temperature for your water heater.\nA water heater that isn't properly managed can lead to out-of-control utility bills and potential health risks. According to the US Department of Energy, keeping your water temperature too high can create a risk of scalding -- and you might shocked to learn that studies have found tap water scald burns result in more than 1,500 hospital admissions and 100 deaths per year in the US. On top of that, adjusting your water heater temperature can save on your energy bill.\nSo how to do you adjust your water heater, and just what should you adjust it to? Don't worry. We'll help you get everything just right.\nThe correct temperature range\nWhat exactly is the ideal water heater temperature? It can be found right at the intersection of safety, health and efficiency.\nMost modern water heaters have a manufacturer-preset for water temperature set at 140 degrees Fahrenheit. That's fine, but it's also higher than recommended by the Department of Energy and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Those agencies suggest you turn the water temperature down to about 120 F, noting that the difference in the risk of getting burned drops significantly with that little tweak. According to the American Burn Association, it takes just five seconds to get a severe burn from water set at 140 F. By contrast, it takes up to five minutes to get such a burn at 120 F.\nIf you want things to run a little hot, you can take extra safety precautions. \"To address these risks, anti-scald devices can be installed on faucets,\" said Max Veggeberg, CEO of Tetra, a home services company.\nThere are risks to turning your water heater temperature down too low, too. While lowering temperatures reduces scalding risks, setting your water heater below 120 F may create concerns about bacterial growth, particularly Legionella, which can cause Legionnaires' disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that Legionella bacteria multiply in water temperatures between 77 and 113 F, making the 120 F recommendation a careful balance between safety and sanitization.\nAs for efficiency, water temperature matters quite a bit -- water heating costs typically account for nearly 20% of the average home\u2019s energy bill, making it the second-largest energy expense for most people.\n\"The temperature setting directly affects how much energy your water heater consumes. The higher the temperature, the more energy it needs to maintain that temperature level,\" said David Miloshev, an HVAC expert at Fantastic Services. \"Consequently, by setting the temperature correctly, you can effectively lower your energy consumption and reduce your energy bills.\"\nEach 10-degree reduction in water temperature can save 3 to 5% on water heating costs. For the average American household, lowering a water heater from 140 to 120 F could translate to annual savings of between $36 and $61, per the Department of Energy. Additionally, lower temperatures reduce energy consumption and wear and tear, potentially extending the lifespan of your water heater and reducing maintenance costs.\nAdjusting water heater temperature\nSo how do you adjust your water heater temperature? That answer will depend on the type of water heater that you have. And if you\u2019re in the market for a water heater, you\u2019ll want to keep in mind some of the challenges and benefits each type presents.\n\"Which one is best for you to save money will depend on your unique living situation,\" said Miloshev. \"However, what you\u2019ll need to consider with water heaters is the fuel type, availability and cost, size, energy efficiency and costs.\"\nGas water heaters\nFor gas water heaters, look for the temperature dial on the gas valve near the bottom of the tank. In some cases, this dial typically doesn't show actual temperatures, just warm to hot settings. Adjust in the direction you\u2019re trying to shift your water temperature, then check the water temperature with a thermometer after 24 hours to see what the temperature is. Since the controls can be a bit spotty, make small adjustments until you reach your preferred temperature.\nElectric water heaters\nElectric water heaters usually have two thermostats -- one at the top and one at the bottom of the tank -- hidden behind access panels. Before adjusting, turn off the power to the water heater at your circuit breaker. Remove the access panels and any insulation to expose the thermostats. Use a flathead screwdriver to adjust both thermostats to the same temperature. Replace insulation and panels, restore power and wait 24 hours before testing.\nTankless water heaters\nTankless water heaters are usually the easiest to adjust. Most have either a digital display panel or a temperature control dial. Simply adjust to your desired temperature following the manufacturer's instructions. Many models allow precise temperature settings in small increments.\n\"Tankless water heaters offer precise control, reducing overheating risks,\" said Veggeberg, \"while tank systems require periodic maintenance to optimize safety and performance.\"\nConnected water heaters\nSmart water heaters can be controlled through smartphone apps or home automation systems. Open the app, locate your water heater settings, and adjust the temperature with a simple slider or digital input. Some smart models also allow you to create schedules for different temperature settings throughout the day, which can be handy to save on bills if you\u2019re on a variable rate plan.\nOther considerations\nMiloshev said that larger households with more people might want to raise the water temperature slightly to deal with increased usage. Likewise, keep in mind your daily routines. \u201cIf you run multiple appliances simultaneously, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and shower, a slightly higher setting can prevent inconveniences, such as the water turning cold in the middle of using it,\u201d he said.\nYou should also consider the weather conditions where you live. Be practical. When it gets cold, you\u2019ll probably want your water to be a bit hotter to compensate. \u201cYou\u2019ll still need to be cautious not to overheat it because this can still be a safety hazard and energy waste,\" said Miloshev.\nIs your home energy efficient? Here are five ways to find out.\nWater heater FAQs\nHow do I pick the right water heater?\nWater heaters come in many shapes and sizes. Your decision starts with choosing between a storage, heat pump-based or solar water heater. You'll also want to consider its capacity. Depending on your use case, a smaller water heater might be sufficient. However, for most households, a 10- to 15-gallon water heater is recommended. If you're considering a tankless water heater, look for its gallons per minute rating. Refer to CNET's guide to picking the best water heater for your needs for everything you need to consider when upgrading or buying a new water heater.\nIs it worth investing in a solar water heater?\nA solar water heater can be a smart investment for those prioritizing energy savings and sustainability. While the initial cost of a solar water heater is higher, it reduces reliance on municipal power, cuts your carbon footprint and lasts over 20 years. It does require roof space and is weather-dependent, but pairing it with a conventional heater can offset this. For a deeper look, check out our comprehensive guide on solar water heaters."

      "text": "Power surges can occur quickly and without warning, especially in the summer heat, often triggered by lightning strikes or electrical outages, and can cause serious damage to your electronics. According to the Institute of Engineering and Technology, surge protectors are designed to help protect laptops, tablets, TVs and home appliances from power surge damage.\nOur Picks\nNew appliances and electronics can be expensive these days, especially in light of inflation and tariff-related price hikes, so it's important to do what you can to keep them safe with a good surge protector. Unlike basic extension cords or power strips, surge protectors are specifically designed to absorb the excess energy from these dangerous voltage fluctuations before they reach your electronics. They're an essential piece of hardware that can prevent system crashes, extend your tech's lifespan and even protect against electrical fires. We've rigorously tested 16 of the top surge protectors from brands like Belkin, Tripp, Anker and Amazon to find you the best surge protection options.\nWhat is the best surge protector overall?\nThe Tripp Lite TLP1208TELTV is our overall pick for the top surge protector. It comes equipped with a long power cord, four wide-set outlets and eight close-spaced ones, along with a $150,000 equipment protection policy and one of the highest joule ratings we've seen for under $100.\nFor those seeking surge protection with specific features or smaller sizes, we have more recommendations below worth checking out.\nWhat we updated: April 2025\nWe removed the APC P11U2 -- our former best pick -- since the product has been discontinued.\nWhat we updated: May 2025\nWe removed the Anker PowerPort Strip PD 2 Mini as the product is out of stock.\nBest surge protectors of 2025\nPros\n- RJ11 outlet\n- Very high joule rating\n- Lifetime insurance coverage\n- Plenty of ports/outlets\nCons\n- No USB\n- Pricey\nWhy I like it: The Tripp Lite TLP1208TELTV offers most of the features we liked in our previous but now-discontinued favorite, the APC P11U2. It has only four wide-set outlets but eight close-spaced ones. There's no USB, but you get three RJ11 for telephone (one in, two out) and two coax for cable or satellite. It has a claimed 2,880 joule rating. I have one in my testing lab.\nIt has an 8-foot cord and comes with $150,000 \"Ultimate Lifetime Insurance\" coverage and a limited lifetime warranty.\nWho it's for: It's usually a little more expensive, but it's ideal if you want something to protect landlines or cable/satellite.\nWho shouldn't buy it: No USB ports, so it's not a good option if you're looking to protect devices that charge via USB only.\nPros\n- Wireless switch\n- Comes with wall mount and sticky-tape\n- Compact size\n- Two 'always-on' outlets\n- Large warranty for connected devices\nCons\n- Lower joule rating\n- Shorter cord\n- Pricey\nWhy I like it: The Belkin F7C01008q has a handy feature: It comes with a wireless switch. Six of the eight wide-spaced outlets are controlled by this switch, which you can mount somewhere nearby via its included wall mount and sticky-tape. This allows you to stick the actual surge protector behind a large TV or console and you won't have to worry about reaching it to power on and off. The protector itself is flat, with far less bulk than the APC or Tripp Lite.\nWho it's for: This model is perfect for home theater setup with multiple power sources.\nWho shouldn't buy it: The more valuable the equipment, the more joules you'll need. This surge protector has a claimed 1,000-joule rating, which is lower than my top picks. For devices that store sensitive or valuable data, the Conserve Switch might not be the best option. However, it's important to note that the Conserve Switch has a $100,000 warranty for connected equipment. It has a shorter cord, too, though at 4 feet, it should be long enough for most situations.\nIf you like the look of this design but don't need the switch, check out the Belkin BE112230, listed in the Others We Tested section below.\nPros\n- Rotates 180 degrees\n- One in and out RJ11 outlet\n- Connected equipment warranty\n- Unique shape\nCons\n- Grounded wall warts might not fit correctly\nWhy I like it: It has a claimed 1,800-joule rating and comes with a $150,000 Connected Equipment Warranty. In addition to the power outlets, there are also in-and-out RJ11 telephone connections. The cable to the wall is 6 feet long.\nWho it's for: Unlike most other surge protectors, the Belkin BP108000 is tubular instead of box-shaped. Long and thin, it can sit behind or under furniture better than most other designs. Seven of its nine AC outlets rotate almost 180 degrees, so you can fit big wall wart chargers on all of them.\nWho shouldn't buy it: The other two outlets are widely spaced from each other, but are close to the bottom of the protector. This won't be an issue if you're plugging in cables, but grounded wall warts might not fit correctly.\nPros\n- Plugs directly into outlet\n- Outlets turn 90 degrees\n- Wall mount design\nCons\n- No warranty\nWhy I like it: The Amazon S9P658O300A00 plugs directly into your wall outlet, adding four more places for plugs. All six outlets on this Amazon Basics protector turn 90 degrees, so you can accommodate up to six wall warts if you turn the top and bottom plugs in the opposite direction of the middle ones. It's also super cheap compared to the other choices on this list.\nWho it's for: Use with small, inexpensive electronics like lamps, clocks or small appliances.\nWho shouldn't buy it: It doesn't have a connected equipment warranty and with a claimed joule rating of 1,080 joules, it's not the best choice for valuable or expensive equipment.\nPros\n- Fail safe\n- Compact\nCons\n- No warranty\nWhy I like it: The Accell D080B-051B looks like a squid or maybe a six-legged octopus. (Hexapus?) I feel like this is enough reason to buy it, but it may not be for everyone. Its main benefit is that, instead of rigid outlets on a flat frame like most surge protectors, it has five short cables with the outlets at the end.\nWho it's for: The Accell is rated at a claimed 1,080 joules. Most surge protectors will continue to pass power when they've passed their joule rating, but the D080B-051B has a fail safe, cutting power so your gear is protected against further surges. You will need to buy a new one if this should happen, but the whole point is to protect your more expensive gear. It's surprising that more surge protectors aren't built like this.\nWho shouldn't buy it: Unlike the others on my list, there's no connected device warranty -- meaning the company doesn't have a program to replace your fried devices should it occur. Although with Accell's unique fail-safe, you might not need it.\nMost people probably won't need this specific type of functionality, but I'm sure some of you are looking at it and know exactly how it will fit in your home.\nSurge protectors, compared\n| Product | Number of Ports/Outlets | Joules | Voltage | Cord Length | Warranty | Key Features | Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Tripp Lite TLP1208TELTV | 12 total (8 wide-spaced) | 2,880 | 120 volts | 8 ft. | Lifetime; $150,000 on connected equipment | RJ11 outlet, high joule rating, lifetime insurance coverage | $46 |\n| Belkin Conserve Switch F7C01008q | 8 total (6 wide-spaced) | 1,000 | 120 volts | 4 ft. | 1 year; $100,000 on connected equipment | Wireless switch, wall mount, compact size | $46 |\n| Accell D080B-051B (Out of Stock) | 5 total (cord style) | 1,080 | 120 volts | 3 ft. | None | Fail safe, compact | $40 |\n| Belkin BP108000 | 9 total (7 wide-spaced) | 1,800 | 125 | 6 ft. | $150,000 on connected equipment | 180-degree rotating outlets, RJ11 outlet, unique shape | $3 |\n| Amazon S9P658O300A00 | 6 total (all wide-spaced) | 1,080 | 120 volts | N/A | None | Plugs directly into outlet, outlets turn 90 degrees, wall mount | $13 |\nHow I tested surge protectors\nWhen I tested these surge protectors there were three things I looked for:\n1. Well-spaced sockets: One of the most important things was having enough outlets to fit the wall wart power adapters that come with most products. These bulky connectors usually take up two or more spaces on normal outlets and power strips. I physically checked each power strip to see if its outlets were sufficiently spaced to fit multiple warts.\n2. A high joule rating (preferably 1,000 or more): Joule ratings indicate how much energy a surge protector can absorb before failing. It's essentially a measure of how much protection each surge protector will offer you. A rating was required, and all my picks had ratings comparable to or higher than their competitors. It'd be great to have a minimum or recommended rating, but such a thing doesn't exist for these kinds of products.\n3. Whether it came with a \"connected device\" warranty: I also gave preference to products that come with a guarantee in case your gear is destroyed by a power surge. Nearly all of my picks have this kind of warranty, often in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Are you likely to get your money back if your gear gets zapped? Hard to say. Insurance like this is hard to collect on, as some companies will only replace connected gear \"at their option.\" Having this sort of guarantee does give you some peace of mind, however; more than you have without it, and perhaps it will cover you in a way your homeowners or renters insurance doesn't.\nWith all of this in mind, I compiled a list of nearly 50 surge protectors and then chose the top 16 to test. My last bit of testing was hands-on. Specs can tell you a lot, but very quickly I found some of these to be better than others. Some had features that seemed useful but weren't. Others were larger or smaller than they seemed in pictures, which in some cases was a good thing or in the case of the travel surge protectors, not so much. Our top picks were the ones that had the best combination of features, specs and felt the most practical in normal use.\nRead more: 10 Shocking Facts About Power Strips\nOther good surge protectors\nThe Belkin SRA007p12tt6 is a classy-looking 12-outlet surge protector with a matte-white finish that would work better on a desk or otherwise visible spot than most of the other large protectors. Six of its outlets are widely spaced, and there are two 2.4-amp USB-A and one 3-amp USB-C outlet (4.5 amps combined max output). The wall plug is conveniently angled at 90 degrees at the end of the 6-foot cable.\nThe APC P6WU2 (Update: Currently Unavailable) is a chunky wall-mount design with six side-mounted outlets and two USB ports on the front. Depending on what you're plugging into it, they might bunch up or not fit against the wall. The Amazon S9P658O300A00 can fit more plugs for a somewhat similar footprint. However, the APC has a connected device warranty ($50,000), while the Amazon doesn't. For something similar but smaller, check out the Belkin BSV300ttCW mentioned below.\nThe Belkin BE112230 shares the flat design of the switched Belkin F7C01008q, just without the switch. It has six wide-spaced outlets, a claimed 3,940 joules of protection and a connected equipment warranty.\nThe Belkin BST300bg is a decent travel alternative to the Accell. It has three outlets on the front and two USB ports on the top. The plug swivels so you can orient it in multiple ways. The Accell is a little smaller, but this is a good runner-up.\nThe wall-mounted Belkin BSV300ttCW has three outlets and two USB ports, all on the front. Its most interesting design feature is a lipped top surface where you can lean your phone while it's charging.\nThe cube-shaped Belkin SRA006p3tt5 is similar to the currently unavailable Anker in that it's a small protector at the end of a long cord. The Anker's smaller size and dedicated USB-C connection are more convenient, but if you're connecting larger wall warts, they'll likely fit better on this.\nWhat's the difference between a surge protector and a power strip?\nA power strip and surge protector may look similar, but the power strip will not offer surge protection for appliances and devices plugged into it. Plug-in surge protectors work by absorbing and diverting a surge. The excess voltage is sent to the outlet's ground wire -- the third prong in modern electrical sockets -- and prevented from reaching any devices that are plugged into that socket. A power strip will simply give you more outlets to plug in electronics.\nThe easiest way to tell the difference between a basic strip and a surge protector is by checking if it has a joule rating. All surge protectors will have one, and it's essentially how much of a power surge it can protect against.\nFactors to consider\nGet more outlets than you think you need. Generally, the next size up from what you\u2019re considering will give you room to grow if you need to add new gear or devices down the road.\nTwo might be better than one. If you\u2019re connecting enough devices to fill a surge protector, it\u2019s worth considering getting two smaller ones (say, two eights instead of one 12). Spreading out the electrical load could be safer. Even more practical, it also might allow you to connect to two different outlets. This is especially important if you\u2019re connecting a lot of high-power devices. Of course, this isn\u2019t always possible, but it\u2019s worth considering.\nMake sure it's within reach. An easily reachable power switch, or even a wireless remote, can seem like a simple thing but one that can improve usability significantly.\nA surge protector isn't always enough. If your location is prone to lightning strikes, you\u2019ll want more protection than just a surge protector. Using a surge protector to protect against lightning is like using a baby gate to stop an elephant.\nSurge protector FAQs\nDo I need a surge protector when traveling?\nNeed? No, but it doesn't hurt to protect your gear. More important when traveling is having enough outlets to connect all your electronics. You'd be surprised at how few accessible outlets many hotels have.\nIs it bad to plug too many things into a surge protector?\nYes, though depending on what you're trying to connect, it might not matter. The outlets in most American homes are either 15 or 20 amps. This equals approximately 1,800 to 2,400 watts. Can you connect your TV, soundbar and game consoles to one surge protector? Generally, yes. Can you connect your fridge, air conditioner, electric stove and clothes dryer to one? No. Check the wattage rating on your gear. You're better off using more surge protectors, plugged into their own separate outlets.\nCan a surge protector protect against lightning?\nNo. If lightning strikes your house, a surge protector will unlikely do anything to save your gear. There would just be too much power to handle. Some surge protectors have warranties that might cover some of the cost of your gear in the case of a lightning strike, but not all. It's best to read the fine print. Lighting protection has to involve redirection, for example with a lightning rod, which is beyond the scope of this guide.\nIs an expensive surge protector worth it?\nTo an extent, yes. Generally, more expensive surge protectors have higher joule ratings (more protection) and better equipment protection policies if something happens. Surge protectors with higher prices might include options like uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), which are essentially surge protectors with built-in batteries, and whole-home surge protection.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a power strip and a surge protector?\nThe difference between a power strip and a surge protector is that a power strip is just additional outlets, while a surge protector has additional circuitry to help protect your TV, soundbar or anything that's plugged in. While the terms are used interchangeably, there's a big difference.\nCan I plug a surge protector into an extension cord?\nIt's generally not recommended to plug a surge protector into an extension cord. Ideally, a surge protector should be plugged directly into a wall outlet to prevent voltage drops, overloading and for overall better protection."

      "text": "Summer is here and so is our first heat wave. Not everyone has central air and installing window unit is a pain -- especially if you want the portability of cooling one room at a time. That's where a portable air conditioner comes in. The best portable air conditioners are high quality and easily moved. They're also very powerful, with excellent cooling power, smart assistant compatibility and the ability to add dehumidification. Pair your AC with an air purifier to improve your air quality and give your home both clean and cold air circulating throughout. To help narrow down your options, we tested these popular units.\nWhat is the best overall portable air conditioner?\nWhether you need a portable AC for an apartment, a stuffy room or any other space, we\u2019ve tested top units in the CNET Testing Lab to find the best at cooling and maintaining comfort. But if you're looking for a straightforward answer, our newest pick, the Black+Decker BPP08WTB, is the best budget portable AC unit.\nRead more: Best Smart Home Gifts\nNot only did the Midea MAP14HS1TBL excel in performance compared with most portable air conditioners we tested, but it also has a lot of features and specialty options. This model isn't cheap, but it's a well-rounded luxury AC unit with everything you need -- and then some.\nTo start, the MAP14HS1TBL has the highest cooling capacity of any other model we tested. Those 12,000 BTUs come in handy for cooling larger spaces up to 550 square feet, and it showed in the performance. The Midea model beat out the two other larger AC units in this list, the Haier QPWA14YZMW and the LG LP1419IVSM, in both of our performance tests.\nThis model also comes with a standard remote control and has sleep mode, timer and dehumidifier functions, as well as an app and support for Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\nOverall, the Midea MAP14HS1TBL has all the premium features and options you'd expect for its price. Throw in its stellar performance and this unit is our top pick to cool larger spaces. Keep in mind that this air conditioner was also the heaviest unit we tested at 77 pounds, but like the rest, it comes with wheels for easy maneuvering.\nQuiet, powerful, compact and efficient. The Black+Decker BPP08WTB delivers power at a very competitive price, earning the title of best small portable AC unit.\nIn our temperature consistency test, it outperformed all other units, maintaining a set point of 68 degrees Fahrenheit with a score of 48.3%. No other small portable AC unit achieved this level of performance. This unit offers exceptional value.\nKey features include an easy-to-use LCD remote control with a \u201cfollow me\u201d function, allowing you to set the thermostat to your desired temperature from a distance. This unit is ideal for areas with high humidity, as it also functions as a dehumidifier, capable of removing up to 80 pints of moisture per day.\nThe Haier QPWA14YZMW is an excellent midpoint between the Black+Decker and Midea AC units. Its price sits in the middle of the best small and best high-end air conditioners, yet it offers similar specs and performance to the Midea model but without some of the advanced features.\nSpecifically, this Haier AC unit has a 9,700-Btu cooling capacity and can cool up to a 550-square-foot room. While its cooling capacity is lower than the 12,000-Btu Midea air conditioner, the Haier unit held its own during testing. It managed to maintain a 68-degree set temperature for over 75% of its running time (compared with the Midea's 85%). It also maintained its lowest temperature 70.9% of its running time, after the Midea's 80.1% and the Whirlpool's 73.5%.\nRegarding features, this unit has a remote control, timer and dehumidifier functions. It also has an app, but you won't have support for voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.\nOverall, this Haier portable air conditioner performed well but cost less, and it has fewer features than the Midea AC unit. If you don't want all the extras of the Midea, the Haier QPWA14YZMW is a solid alternative at great value. If you don't need a portable air conditioner that can cool up to 550 square feet, look instead to a smaller unit.\nThe contenders\nWe tested 10 portable air conditioners for this best list (some of which are no longer featured): the Black+Decker BPP08WTB, the Black+Decker BPACT14WT, the Frigidaire FHPC082AC1, the GE APCD08JALW, the Haier QPWA14YZMW, the LG LP1419IVSM (Out of Stock), the Midea MAP10S1CWT, the Midea MAP14HS1TBL, the Whirlpool WHAP131BWC and the Whynter ARC-14S. In the chart below, you can get an overview of each unit and how they compare in terms of pricing, specs and features.\nAt a glance, you can see we tested some units with similar specs, while also covering a wide range of options. Not only do the prices vary from $310 to $699, but half of the units are designed to cool smaller 350-square-foot rooms, while the rest can handle larger spaces up to 500 or 550 square feet. They also vary in terms of BTU, which ranges in the units we tested from 5,500 to 12,000 BTU.\nIt's worth noting here that there are currently two different standards for determining BTU capacity: the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers' BTU rating and the Department of Energy's Seasonally Adjusted Cooling Capacity Btu rating. For that reason, many manufacturer sites list both the Ashrae and the SACC ratings in their specs.\nFor example, the Frigidaire FHPC082AC1 we tested has an Ashrae capacity of 8,000 BTU, while the DOE's SACC rating for the same unit is 5,500 BTU. The SACC standard was developed more recently and is being broadly adopted across manufacturers, so we use the SACC Btu capacity as the default standard anywhere we reference Btu capacity in this list. Still have questions about this? Learn more about the SACC standard here (PDF).\nHow we test\nTo test portable air conditioners, we heat a climate-controlled room to 92 degrees. After the room reaches 92 degrees, we turn off the heat and turn on the portable AC unit to cool mode, with a medium fan speed and a set temperature of 68 degrees. We run the unit for 2 hours and 30 minutes and repeat the same test twice per AC unit. We then use the data collected during the tests to measure two things:\n- How consistently the portable air conditioner keeps the room within 5% of 68 degrees\n- How consistently it kept the room within 5% of the AC unit's individual lowest temperature\nOnce we have this information, we compare the results across the units to see which ones maintained the set temperature for the longest period of time. We also look at which units maintained their individual lowest temperature for the longest time. We did this so that if a unit didn't reach 68 degrees in the allotted time, we were still able to track how consistently it maintained the lowest temperature it achieved. The higher the percentage, the better the unit performed.\nWhen looking at performance, it's important to note that the units we tested don't have identical specs, so direct performance comparisons aren't the only thing we consider when arriving at our list of best portable air conditioners. We also look at a unit's features and other options in reference to its price and specifications to determine its overall value.\nWe also don't draw direct performance comparisons when looking at units of vastly different sizes and capabilities, say, the 12,000-BTU Midea MAP14HS1TBL versus the 5,500-BTU Frigidaire FHPC082AC1. For this reason, we compared performance results in two groups based on coverage area. Specifically, we compared the smaller Midea, Black+Decker, Frigidaire, Whirlpool and GE models (which all have coverage areas of up to 350 square feet) against each other and the larger Black+Decker, Whynter, Haier, LG and Midea models (which have 500-to-550-square-foot coverage areas) against one another.\nPerformance\nDelving a little more into performance, you can see how long all 10 portable air conditioners maintained a temperature set point of 68 degrees. Because we're not comparing the larger units directly with the smaller ones, we've displayed the two groups in separate charts.\nThe Midea air conditioner performed the best, maintaining the 68-degree set point for 85.4% of its runtime. The Haier model came in second with 75.5% and the LG model in third with 74.2%. For the smaller units, the Black+Decker came in at 48.3%, followed by the GE at 39.7% and the Whirlpool model at 25.2%.\nFor the second test, we looked at how consistently the unit maintained its lowest temperature. The Midea air conditioner once again outperformed the other large units by maintaining its lowest temperature for 80.1% of its runtime. The LG model came in second with 73.5% and the Haier model in a close third with 70.9%. For the smaller units, the GE model performed extremely well, closely trailing the larger Haier air conditioner at 68.9%. The Midea model wasn't far behind, at 66.2%, followed by the Frigidaire model at 57%.\nIn addition, we made charts to track the temperature changes of each unit over time. In the chart representing the larger units, the Midea unit's temperature dropped more quickly than the others and maintained the lower temperature for most of its run. For the smaller units, the Black+Decker unit dropped the temperature more quickly, held the lead for much of its run, and cooled to a lower final temperature."

      "text": "Spring is here and temperatures are rising. You've likely already been dealing with high electricity and energy prices, and if rising utility costs are starting to cause you stress, you aren't alone. A recent CNET survey found that more than 78% of US adults are concerned about their home energy bills. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can save on gas, electricity and water even while temperatures surge.\nIf those higher prices are starting to put a strain on your budget, you can start making changes to reduce the energy you use and cut down your bills. Even small habits like unplugging unused appliances, washing your clothes a different way, cooking with certain energy-saving appliances or setting your thermostat to the right temperature can save a bit of money and make your home more efficient.\nHere are eight steps you can take to start saving electricity, gas, water -- and cash. For additional money-saving tips, check out more on how to weatherstrip your home to save on bills and a simple home upgrade that can help you save on summer cooling costs.\n1. Get an electricity audit\nMany electric companies offer a free audit, where they do a room-by-room examination of your home and look at your electricity bills to help determine where you're wasting energy. You can follow the recommendations to help reduce your electric bill. If you can't get an audit for free, you might still be able to qualify it under the energy efficient home improvement credit and recoup the costs during tax season.\nEven if your electric company doesn't provide this service, you can easily perform a DIY home energy audit using the US Department of Energy website's instructions.\n2. Adjust your thermostat\nOne of the simplest ways to reduce your electricity bill is to adjust your thermostat. According to the Department of Energy, you can save as much as 10% on your heating and cooling costs by adjusting your thermostat by 7 to 10 degrees for 8 hours per day. In other words, keep it a bit warmer in the summer and a bit cooler in the winter.\nA simple way to do this is to adjust your thermostat when you're either asleep or away from home. If you have a smart thermostat, you can preset your thermostat to adjust during these hours so you don't forget.\n3. Turn down your water heater\nMany water heater manufacturers set thermostats at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 C). But in reality, most households only need it set at a maximum of 120 Fahrenheit. Setting your water heater to a lower temperature can save hundreds of dollars a year.\nAdjusting a water heater's temperature is a quick and easy fix. The thermostat dial on your water heater is likely near the bottom of the tank on the electric or gas control valve. Be sure to check the owner's manual for instructions to adjust it -- and if you have any questions, consult a professional technician.\n4. Turn off and unplug what you aren't using\nBy leaving things around your house plugged in and turned on when you aren't using them, you're driving up your electric bill unnecessarily.\nYou can start by turning off lights when you aren't in the room or when it's light enough outside to rely solely on natural light. Multiply your light bulb's wattage by what your electricity provider charges per kilowatt to find out how much you're saving. That amount only increases with the wattage of the bulb. While it doesn't seem like much, it can add up over time.\nYou can also save money by unplugging appliances you aren't using. Phantom energy, the energy your appliances use when they're plugged in but not turned on, can cost an average of $100 per year.\n5. Use your dishwasher\nIt might sound counterintuitive to suggest running an appliance to save on your electricity bill. And yes, there was a time where dishwashers used far more water than they do today. But the Department of Energy regulates how much water modern dishwashers can use. Any dishwasher manufactured since 2013 is limited to using 5 gallons of water. If it's a compact size dishwasher, it's limited to 3.5 gallons.\nYou might think that surely you use less than 5 gallons of water to hand-wash your dishes. But the US Geological Survey estimates that it takes anywhere from 9 to 27 gallons of water to hand-wash a load of dishes. (If you're curious, we've also got a tip on how to load your dishwasher the right way.)\n6. Take advantage of off-peak rates\nElectricity use tends to be higher during certain times of the day and the year. First, demand is higher in the winter and summer when people are running heaters and air conditioners. It's also higher during the daytime and evening hours.\nSome electricity companies offer time-of-use plans, increasing rates during peak hours and decreasing them during off-peak hours. If you have one of these plans, you can save money by running large appliances like your dishwasher and washing machine early in the morning or late at night.\n7. Change your air filters\nYour air filter helps to catch any dirt, dust, pet hair and more, preventing it from making its way into your HVAC. When you don't change your air filters regularly enough, this debris gets into your HVAC system and bogs it down, reducing its efficiency. According to the Department of Energy, replacing your filters on schedule can lower your air conditioner's energy consumption by anywhere from 5% to 15%.\n8. More ways to save on your bills\nThere are many steps, big and small, that you can take to reduce your consumption and save money on your bills. The Department of Energy has an entire section of its website devoted to providing tips to help you save on energy. And while plenty of them come with a price tag, there are many more just like those on this list that you can do for free.\nFor more, check out the ceiling fan trick that can help your house stay cooler this summer, and you can also explore our solar cheat sheet.\nMore energy and money saving tips\n- Want to Save Money?

      "text": "Whether you\u2019re a smart home expert or you\u2019re just getting started, smart plugs are a must. Nothing beats the simplicity of a smart plug: Plug it into a standard wall outlet and it can make any device smart, allowing you to set on/off schedules (think coffeemakers or floor lamps) and monitor energy use, among other handy tricks for appliances you already have around your home.\nOur Picks\nSMART LIGHT BULB DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $99 (save $61)\n- $19 (save $6)\n- $28 (save $12)\n- $110 (save $20)\nWe've tested dozens of models from top brands like GE, Leviton and TP-Link across all major platforms, including Alexa, Google and HomeKit. Here are the ones that impressed us most.\nWhat is the best smart plug overall?\nCNET has tested countless smart plugs over the years and we brought in more than 10 new models to determine the best smart plugs currently on the market. The result is this guide to our top five smart plugs -- starting with the Emporia 15W smart plug, which topped our list thanks to its easy setup and excellent electricity management options.\nRead on to see why we chose it, and the other plugs that made our list.\nRead more: These Smart Plugs Are the Secret to a Seamless Smart Home\nBest smart plugs of 2025\nPros\n- Excellent energy management\n- Affordable at less than $15\n- Very easy account setup\n- Compact enough for most outlets\nCons\n- No Apple support\n- Not everyone wants so many energy management options\nWhy I like it:\nThe Emporia smart plug combines affordability with excellent app operation and energy management, making it one of the best smart plugs I've come across with easy, highly customizable control. The rounded design and on/off side switch always proved top-notch.\nFrom the home screen display, you can see connected devices and their on/off status along with how much energy they are using. Tapping the plug or power icons will take you to the on/off settings or you can tap on the device name to see a graph of your plug's (that is, whatever's plugged into it) energy use over time. In addition to the charts, you can also set the plug for automatic scheduling to save energy or create your own schedules on the fly. It's intuitive and easy to master.\nThe only disappointment I had with Emporia's plug is that it's not compatible with Apple Home (hopefully HomeKit support is on the way) and works best if you use Emporia's own app for detailed management, although Google Home/Gemini and Alexa compatibility are included.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers who want a smart plug with easy setup and excellent electricity management.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who aren't interested in tracking energy, users who need an Apple-compliant plug.\nPros\n- Affordable at less than $15\n- Customized scheduling options\n- Very compact size\nCons\n- Lacking energy management options\nWhy I like it:\nI've tested the TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini before and it remains one of my favorite plugs, especially for those who want an affordable option.\nThis smart device works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant via your Wi-Fi network and the Kasa app (Android and iOS) offers plenty of detailed options for customizing scheduling, away modes and timers.\nAlas, this Wi-Fi smart plug doesn't offer energy-consumption data, a USB port or HomeKit compatibility, which keeps it from the very top of my list even if other features are excellent.\nWho is this for:\nUsers who want an extra-affordable, simple plug.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who need USB ports or energy monitoring.\nPros\n- Apple compatibility thanks to Matter, which is hard to find in smart plugs\n- Inituive app with home/away modes, vacation mode and more\n- Handy indicator light/button\nCons\n- Expensive compared to alternatives at more than $20\nWhy I like it:\nI liked the Leviton D215P-2RW smart plug right out of the box. For a smart plug, it has a sleek design. I'm particularly fond of the little corner window that acts as a button to manually turn the device on and off and as an indicator light -- features that most smart plugs keep separated. It's also slimmer than most smart plugs I've seen, which is nice if you're working with a limited space.\nDesign aside, I found the Leviton smart plug easy to set up and the app is pleasantly simple. The home screen displays all connected plugs (or other Leviton smart devices) and their status, along with the ability to switch them on or off with a tap. Setting a schedule for the plug was also easy and intuitive.\nAnother standout feature of the Leviton smart plug: Thanks to its Matter support, it plays nicely with all three of the major smart home ecosystems. I had no problem connecting the smart plug to my Google Home Mini but I did have to download the Leviton \"skill\" to connect to Alexa. It's an extra step but one that only took about 30 seconds. Leviton is also compatible with Apple HomeKit and Siri, which is somewhat rarer for a smart plug.\nWho is this for:\nApple fans looking for a high-quality, Matter-compatible smart plug.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who don't need a lot of compatibility features.\nPros\n- Excellent app controls for swift management\n- Quick voice assistant connections for Alexa and Google\n- A variety of Cync routines with other devices\nCons\n- Needs compatible smart home devices to really shine\n- More than $25 when not on sale\nWhy I like it:\nSpeaking of apps, GE's Cync app is nothing short of delightful. The initial smart plug setup took me through a series of simple, step-by-step instructions complemented by soft, home-inspired imagery in the background. The setup also prompted me to connect to Alexa and Google devices, something I had to navigate to within the app or go to a hub to do with other smart plugs.\nOnce your smart plug is set up, you can control on/off settings from the home screen or tap \"Routines\" to set a schedule. There are a number of other functions and settings you can play with, such as grouping devices together for simultaneous control or creating \"scenes\" with custom settings, like turning off a set of lights before starting a movie or changing the smart light bulbs to your team's color on game day.\nIf it sounds complicated, you can get a user-friendly, eye-pleasing breakdown of how to use all the various Cync features under Settings > App Tutorials.\nI'm getting away from the smart plug a bit but that's because the GE Cync app is clearly intended to incorporate multiple devices and support total home automation. You can use the smart plug on its own but the app invites you to do much more.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who want an elegant, excellent app experience for their smart plug.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who aren't interested in smart home stuff like routines, grouping and device management.\nPros\n- Two outlets with separate control functions\n- Convenient app design\n- Very affordable at less than $10\nCons\n- No Apple support for this model, either\nWhy I like it:\nYou get two for the price of one here. The HBN smart plug is one of the few I've seen with two independently controlled outlets. Even with the extra outlet, the smart plug isn't that much wider than other single plugs and it's still compact enough to plug something else in above or below it.\nI'm sure there are quite a few uses for a dual smart plug but plugging my Christmas tree lights into one and a corner lamp into the other immediately comes to mind. Currently, I have a light fixture and a fan plugged in and the ability to independently control one or the other is pretty nifty.\nI also found the HBN to be user-friendly, and for alternatives its voice assistant is compatible with Alexa and Google. Each outlet is nameable, so you can turn off a single outlet by saying \"Alexa, turn off Switch 2,\" or control both outlets at once by referring to the device name.\nYou can also create separate schedules for each outlet. Here at home, I've set my fan to come on during these sweltering Southern summer days while the lamp is programmed to come on at night. Again, pretty nifty.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers who want two outlets on their plug.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who prefer a more compact plug and only want to use it with one device.\nPros\n- Native Alexa compatibility\n- Auto-reconnect to the Alexa app\n- Swift setup if you're comfortable with Alexa\nCons\n- More than $20 is quite expensive for a smart plug\nWhy I like it:\nAmazon's own entry into the smart plug market is, to no surprise, incredibly compatible with Alexa. If you already use the Alexa app, that makes this plug particularly easy to set up, with no need to create another account or learn any third-party app. In addition to all those Alexa voice commands (and any Alexa Plus improvements that may come in the future), Amazon designed the plug to automatically re-connect with Alexa if it suddenly goes offline, a boon during power outages.\nWho is this for:\nAlexa fans who want a painless setup process.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who prefer Google/Gemini and Apple support.\nBest Smart Plugs Compared\n| Emporia smart plug | TP-Link Kasa smart Wi-Fi plug mini | Leviton D215P-2RW | GE Cync smart plug | HBN smart plug | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Smart home support | Google Home/Gemini, Amazon Alexa | Google Home/Gemini, Amazon Alexa, IFTTT | Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit/Siri | Google Home/Gemini, Amazon Alexa | Google Home/Gemini, Amazon Alexa |\n| Energy management | Yes, with automatic peak hour scheduling | No | No | No | No |\n| Amps | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 |\nOther smart plug models we tested\nThere are dozens of smart plugs out there from companies large and small and, while we haven't tested every single one, we've tried out many of the ones you'd come across online or at your local big box store. Here's a quick look at other notable options:\n- ConnectSense Smart Outlet 2: This smart plug does it all -- energy monitoring, individually controlled outlets, a USB port and LED status lighting. The unattractive, oversized design is enough to keep us from recommending it. Everyone loves a smart outlet but no one likes an ugly one.\n- Govee Smart Wi-Fi Plug: The round design is nice and blends in with my wall plate perfectly while leaving plenty of room for another plug. Nothing else really stands out about the plug, unfortunately, but if you want a simple, cheap (currently $10) plug that doesn't scream \"I'm a smart plug,\" this is a good choice.\n- Philips Hue Smart Plug: The Philips Hue app reminded me of GE's Cync app in that the setup was simple and there's the potential to connect multiple devices under whole-home automation. For a single smart plug, this one is fairly expensive at $35 (currently $28) and it doesn't sport any unique features to justify the cost.\n- Wyze: We like the Wyze Smart Plug primarily for its low pricing. The Wyze does all the basic functions of a smart plug and will only set you back $20 for a two-pack. The bargain price is nice but if you only need one plug, there are cheaper options.\n- Enbrighten Dual Smart Plug (Update: Out of Stock): As with the HBN smart plug, I appreciated the extra outlet. The Enbrighten version is significantly wider and doesn't allow for individual control of each outlet, at least not in any way that I could easily figure out. It's also priced a bit higher than the HBN dual outlet at $22.\n- Vont Smart Plug (Update: Out of Stock): Your standard smart plug. Nothing special but nothing that would turn me away from using it, either. If you can catch it on sale, or perhaps in a value-priced two-pack, this smart plug can be a decent, budget-friendly addition to your smart home.\n- WeMo (Update: Out of Stock): We previously featured this smart plug as \"Best for HomeKit\" in spite of other shortcomings like a less-than-impressive app. Yes, the smart plug works well with a HomeKit setup along with Alexa and Google but so does the more user-friendly Leviton plug.\nWhat does a smart plug work with?\nSmart plugs generally work with any device that can fit into a standard American outlet socket (or the standard socket in your region of choice). They work best with devices that have simple on/off states and can start running immediately when turned on. The classic example is a coffeemaker set to start brewing the moment its smart plug is activated but there are a lot of other possibilities -- grow lights, fountain pumps, energy-hogging displays, bedside lamps that can join your alarm in waking you up, and a whole lot more.\nRead more: Want to Buy a Smart Plug? Read This First\nFactors to consider when choosing a smart plug\nPrice\nThe good news is that smart plugs are super affordable and their apps are free to use. However, if you\u2019re on a strict budget it may be worthwhile to look for options that are less than $20. Most of our plug choices are about $15. We even have one or two less than $10, although you may lose some features at prices that low.\nSize and design\nSize is especially important for smart plugs because we only have so much room around our outlets. You may be plugging in other appliances to the spare socket or the outlet may not have much room for a plug to protrude. Compact is usually better as a result. You don\u2019t want a plug that goes out much beyond the edges of the outlet, for example.\nOther important design features include a physical on/off button, which some users find very important, and indicator lights to see the status of the plug.\nSmart home support and Matter\nSmart home support can be very convenient for voice assistants and routines, but compatibility can vary. Apple compatibility is still relatively rare so if you prefer Apple make sure your plug works with HomeKit. Google and Alexa compatibility are more common but ultimately you\u2019ll want home compatibility that your smart devices already have, or what you\u2019re comfortable using.\nEnergy management\nMany smart plugs offer energy management and electricity tracking, which is excellent if you want to see what devices are power hungry and arrange schedules to save money. We prefer these energy management options but not everyone is interested in them and they can make apps a bit more confusing to use.\nApp controls\nApp UI is important even for simple devices like smart plugs. We chose options that are easy to manage and quick to set up, especially with processes like scheduling on/off times. Apps shouldn\u2019t be cluttered with unnecessary content or take a long time to find what you\u2019re looking for.\nAmps\nMost smart plugs are rated for 15A, suitable for most basic devices. But if your device uses more amps than that (like a small heater, for example) you need to find a smart plug that has a higher wattage rating to avoid problems.\nScheduling and modes\nHigh-quality smart plugs should always have the option for scheduling times to turn on or off. More advanced models may offer home/away modes based on location tracking\nOutdoor rating\nThis list focuses on indoor smart plugs but we have a guide for outdoor models, too. If you plan on using the smart plug outdoors, it absolutely needs weather resistance (usually with an IP rating) and a design that allows for outdoor functioning.\nHow we test smart plugs\nTesting a smart plug is relatively straightforward, thanks to the simplicity of these smart home gadgets (which is also why they're such a great starting place). We test these plugs in our own homes, running through several phases.\nApp setup and installation\nFirst we pay close attention to the setup process and how easy it is to get the smart plug up and running. We like to see apps that are easy to understand and preferably options that don't require an extra account to set up. This is also the period where we take a close look at the physical design of the plug, how compact it is and what features it has, such as LED indicators and physical switches.\nPower management and scheduling\nAs we hook up devices for testing, we start looking at scheduling features and how easy it is to turn devices on or off remotely. If plugs are compatible with another app like Alexa or Google Home, we connect them and test control features from there, too. We like to see scheduling options that are easy to set and adjust on the fly.\nEnergy management and savings\nMany smart plugs also include electricity tracking and energy management options. Here, we experiment with how easy it is to watch energy use over time (usually a few days connected to an appliance) and if the app offers features to cut down on electricity use, like automatically turning the device off at peak hours.\nSmart home connections\nIf the smart plugs can function in routines and work with other smart devices, we connect them and see how easy it is to get routines going and how responsive smart plugs are to changes.\nWhat we updated\nSpring 2025: After excellent testing with Emporia's smart plug, I decided to move it to the top of the list for anyone interested in energy management. Also, I added the Amazon smart plug as an option for Alexa users who want particularly speedy setups."

      "text": "This summer has been brutal, with record-breaking heatwaves across the US, and heat domes that have sent the temperature rocketing up into three digits as far north as Connecticut. If your AC has been running nonstop, you might be dealing with some sticker shock at the size of your energy bill. However, there is an easy way to keep your home cooler with the help of a ceiling fan.\nA ceiling fan can make a room feel up to 4 degrees cooler, so you can dial back your air conditioning without sacrificing comfort. All it takes is flipping a switch to ensure it's spinning in the right direction (counterclockwise for summer), and you're on your way to better airflow and lower energy costs.\nIt's one of the easiest ways to beat the heat without raising your utility bill -- no fancy tech or major upgrades are required. Bonus: It's a small move that can shrink your environmental footprint.\nTake a moment to flip this hidden setting on your ceiling fan. You'll stay comfortable all season long and keep your energy bills in check.\nFor more on saving money on energy, learn how unplugging some appliances can save you $100 a year and the most efficient temperature for your thermostat this summer.\nHow to change the direction of your ceiling fan\nChanging the direction of your ceiling fan's rotation is simple. It's usually controlled by a sliding switch on the motor housing. This switch lets you adjust the fan from spinning clockwise to counterclockwise.\nBefore you make any changes, turn off your ceiling fan -- you don't want to hurt yourself or anyone else in your home. Look for the small sliding switch on the side of the fan's motor housing. It should be labeled with markings like \"Forward/Reverse\" or have arrows pointing in opposite directions.\nTo switch rotation to counterclockwise, slide the switch to Forward or Counterclockwise. For clockwise rotation, slide the same directional switch to Reverse or Counterclockwise. The fan blades will start to push air upward to recirculate warmer air.\nIf there's no switch on your ceiling fan, you may have a remote control that can change the direction with the push of a button. And if you've got a smart fan, you can probably change direction with your voice or by using an app. You may need to check your instruction manual for further help.\nSet your ceiling fan to counterclockwise in the summer\nDuring the summer, you'll want your ceiling fan to rotate counterclockwise, blowing cooler air straight down into the room. Just make sure the fins on your fan blades are tilted downward to help push the air toward the floor. You should feel the air in the room start to get cooler.\nSwitch your ceiling fan back to clockwise in the winter\nIn winter, you'll want your ceiling fan to rotate clockwise. The airflow will then be directed upward, circulating hot air from the ceiling back down into the room to help spread warmth.\nOther tips for making the most of your ceiling fans\nIf you want to reap even more benefits from your ceiling fans, choose the right fan. According to the Department of Energy, you should look for fans with the Energy Star label, as they're around 60% more efficient than conventional fans.\nYou'll also want to ensure the fan you're using is the correct size for your room. Larger rooms may need bigger fans with blade spans of at least 52 inches or more, while smaller rooms can get by using fans of 36 inches.\nIf changing your fan blades' direction becomes a pain, you might consider installing a ceiling fan with a remote control or implementing a smart switch. This makes it easier to change the fan direction and speed without reaching up, using a ladder, or fumbling around for the switch to push. The easier it is to change the fan blades' rotation, the easier it is for you to be cooler or warmer in uncomfortable temperatures."

      "text": "If you've been feeling stressed out about rising AC bills lately, you're not alone. A recent CNET survey shows that 78% of US adults are worried about their soaring utility costs. One excellent way to reduce your overall energy usage and cut down your monthly utility costs is to add a smart thermostat to your home. These smart devices learn your daily patterns, fine-tune temperatures automatically and help reduce energy consumption with minimal effort on your part. Beyond the cost benefits, programmable thermostats also come with clever features to manage your home while you're away, prevent rooms from overheating, monitor humidity levels and much more. Many can even be controlled right from your phone.\nOur Picks\nSMART THERMOSTAT DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $81 (save $50)\n- $66 (save $25)\n- $55 (save $46)\n- $189 (save $21)\n- $194 (save $16)\nRead more: This Modest Gadget Is the New Superhero of the Energy-Efficient Home\nWhat is the best thermostat overall?\nAfter many hours testing the functions of the latest smart thermostats, our experts recommend the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium as the top Wi-Fi thermostat that can do everything. This programmable thermostat not only learns your schedule, it also monitors your indoor air quality and lets you adopt Siri or Alexa voice assistant options if you don't have a smart speaker.\nWe've also chosen Amazon's model for an excellent Alexa choice; Nest's latest thermostat for a beautiful, energy-saving powerhouse; an Ecobee model for a budget choice; and more. Take a look at the latest picks and our smart thermostat reviews, below.\nBest smart thermostats of 2025\nPros\n- Learning and vacation modes for complete control\n- Reliable air quality monitoring\n- Built-in speaker for Alexa or Siri\n- Included remote temperature sensor\n- Can control other Ecobee products\nCons\n- Very expensive\nWhy I like it:\nOne of the selling points of a smart thermostat is that it can save you money, so we can\u2019t say money is no object. But if money is no object, the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium eclipses the competition. It offers the most advanced features, like a little sensor with a magnetic stand I could put in any room, and the ability to show a four-day forecast on the thermostat itself.\nThe Ecobee model also comes with a separate satellite sensor to target heating or cooling to levels in a specific room. When I asked Ecobee about its latest features, they responded that the thermostat could help save up to 26% on energy bills and mentioned, \"One of my favorite recent additions to the Ecobee smart thermostat experience is Home Energy Reports. These interactive reports help you visualize and understand the direct benefit of our temperature optimizations on your home\u2019s energy use.\"\nWhile many smart thermostats can work with voice assistant platforms like Google's Home/Gemini options or Alexa, this Premium model is the only one that offers built-in compatibility (plus a mic and speaker) for Alexa and an option to add on Siri, so you don't need an app or smart speaker to give it commands.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who want a ton of smart features in a single device, including built-in voice assistants, and a satellite sensor for detailed home climate control.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who don't want to pay a lot of money, those who already have a smart speaker they're happy with, people who don't want to learn a lot of new features.\nPros\n- Built-in Alexa and Echo compatibility\n- Useful learning features for the price\n- Affordable at under $100\n- Explains energy settings to users\nCons\n- Basic design compared to competitor models\n- Amazon's data privacy raises more questions than other thermostat brands\nWhy I like it:\nThe Amazon Smart Thermostat stands out among its peers in the sub-$100 category by having far better technology, including the ability to sense if you\u2019re home and Alexa\u2019s \u201chunches\u201d to see if a setting will work while saving you energy. It'll save you lots of energy while paying itself off faster, making it an excellent starter model. And if you add an Echo Dot 5, the thermostat can use it as a separate room and air sensor, too.\nAmazon's model doesn\u2019t have quite the advanced features of a $200 thermostat, and its display is fairly basic, but the savings are very significant, and not everyone wants a fancy touchscreen. Another thing I liked: It shows information about your energy and HVAC usage, explaining what it all means -- a smart thermostat that makes the customer smarter.\nNote: Read my full guide on smart thermostat privacy here to see how Amazon approaches this issue and why some users may want to take security precautions.\nWho is this for:\nPeople primarily interested in affordability and effective features, and less concerned with a bunch of extra learning features. It also helps if you don't mind Alexa and Amazon gleaning your household data.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who aren't fans of Alexa, users who want more smart and scheduling options, users particularly concerned about their home privacy.\nPros\n- Beautiful round display\n- Easy-to-use Eco Modes and energy reports\n- Satellite sensor for targeted heating\n- Compatibility with some Nest products like the Nest Hub Max\n- No C-wire required for installation\n- High-quality presence sensing\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Shiny display can be a little distracting\nWhy I like it:\nThe newest version of the Nest Learning Thermostat brings the best high-tech smart technology to an attractive device that works even if your home doesn't have a C-wire. The new model builds on its predecessor's attractive design by adding a sensor that can tell how far you are from the thermostat and change the information on the faceplate accordingly. Mine can even show weather effects like falling snow or the setting sun depending on what's happening outside.\nLike Ecobee's, this model also comes with an included external room sensor, encouraging you from the start to keep track of the comfort level in more than just one room of your home. The beautiful design especially sparkles when showing outdoor temperatures with associated weather animations. On the more practical side, the Nest reports and easy-to-see Eco Modes make saving money very easy.\nWho is this for:\nUsers who love a beautiful thermostat and already have Nest devices, but want something that will save them money with easy eco modes.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nBuyers who want to save on initial costs and aren't especially big fans of the Google Nest ecosystem.\nPros\n- Simple, clean touchscreen interface\n- Quick setup\n- Alexa and Google compatibility\n- Affordable when on sale\n- Provides energy, equipment and maintenance reports\nCons\n- Lacks smart features like built-in presence sensing and learning capabilities\nWhy I like it:\nThe Sensi Touch 2 is an excellent choice if you interact a lot with the physical thermostat. The app is good, and the thermostat is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, but the display on this one really shines. It\u2019s simple, intuitive and clear, allowing you to easily make changes.\nSome other thermostats require you to know what the particular icon means, which can add to the learning curve, but this one is straightforward. Plus, the temperature setting is prominently displayed, and you can set a range of temperatures very easily with the tap of a finger.\nIf you find the larger, flashier thermostat displays a bit overwhelming, Sensi's model may be a breath of cool air. While it's a bit more limited than some picks, it still works with Google and Alexa commands and provides alerts and reminders.\nWho is this for:\nUsers look for a minimalist model with more traditional manual controls that still includes handy smart features like voice assistant support.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who want learning functions and advanced eco modes. plus more sensor options.\nPros\n- Simple, effective controls and app\n- Easy setup\n- Satellite sensor options\n- Humidity and air quality sensors for air management\nCons\n- Making full use of this thermostat requires big investment in Resideo's ecosystem\nWhy I like it:\nThe Honeywell Home T9 was a very nice thermostat that combined smart features with a traditional design, but the upgrades for the T10 truly impressed us. Installation remains simple, and you can largely avoid app use if you prefer to stick with onboard controls. However, smart features still abound, and the thermostat works with remote sensors for targeted heating.\nThe T10 really shines when combined with compatible Resideo whole-house devices like the TrueDRY dehumidifier or F200 Media Air Cleaner. It can use its readings (with an added Equipment Interface Model) to automatically shut this air quality equipment on or off for increased comfort without manual adjustment or complex smart device workarounds -- as long as you're willing to make the investment.\nWho is this for:\nUsers who like the idea of investing in whole-house humidity and air quality control tied to their thermostat.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nUsers who don't really plan on investing in a bunch of Resideo home tech.\nPros\n- Affordable at under $150\n- Keeps many of the best Ecobee features like auto-away mode\n- Streamlined for ease of use\n- Retains the stylish touchscreen\nCons\n- Users who want to pay under $100 will have to look elsewhere\n- Lacks more advanced sensors\nWhy I like it:\nWhile it's not quite as cheap as my Amazon pick, I still think the Ecobee Essential model is one of the best budget thermostats if you're willing to spend around $140 for one. While it doesn't have the Premium's extra sensor or wireless satellite sensor, it does come with all the learning functions, useful screen information and app controls you could want.\nEcobee's compatibility with Siri, Alexa and Google remains as well, so you have plenty of home control options. That makes this an excellent upgrade for those interested in a new thermostat but who would rather keep things simple while still getting lots of smart upgrades.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers looking for a more affordable, streamlined Ecobee thermostat with plenty of energy saving but no extras to worry about setting up.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nBuyers determined to spend less than $150 on a thermostat, users who want extra info about air quality or weather\nSmart thermostats compared\n| Best smart thermostats | Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium | Amazon Smart Thermostat | Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) | Sensi Touch 2 | Honeywell Home T10 Pro Smart Thermostat | Ecobee Smart Thermostat Essential |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Price: | $260 | $80 | $263 | $178 | $209 | $140 |\n| Presence sensing and learning functions: | Yes | Yes with Echo devices | Yes | No | No | Yes |\n| Wireless temperature sensors: | Included, can support multiple sensors in different rooms | Echo Dot 5 can function as a satellite sensor | Satellite sensor included, can average temperatures from multiple sensors | Satellite sensors available (not included) | Satellite sensors available (not included) | Satellite sensors available (not included) |\n| Smart home compatibility: | Apple Home/Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant/Gemini | Amazon Alexa | Amazon Alexa, Google Home/Gemini | Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings | Apple Home/Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings | Apple Home/Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant/Gemini |\n| HVAC C-wired required: | Yes, adapter kits available through Ecobee | Yes | No | Yes | Yes, adapter kits available | Yes, adapter kits available through Ecobee |\n| Additional sensors: | Built-in indoor air quality and humidity sensors | Presence sensing added with Echo Dot | Tracks outdoor weather | N/A | Can track humidity and air quality with the right add-ons | N/A |\n| Review score: | 4.2/5 | 8.6/10 | 4/5 | 3.7/5 | N/A | N/A |\nOther smart thermostats we've tested\nCommercial Electric Smart Thermostat: Despite the name, this new offering from The Home Depot is a residential thermostat built to operate with the company\u2019s Hubspace smart home platform, although it\u2019ll work with Alexa and Google Home. It\u2019s a fairly straightforward system that allows significant control but lacks truly smart features. My favorite feature is setting a schedule based on sunrise or sunset.\nCync Smart Thermostat: This thermostat from GE Lighting, now owned by Savant which offers other home energy products such as solar batteries, offers good smart home interactions and the ability to buy an external sensor, but it lacked some of the more advanced features offered by other thermostats, while still costing more than the Amazon model.\nNest Thermostat: The Nest Thermostat was a compelling choice at a mid-level price range ($205), but a few things held it back. For one, it lacks the intuitive interface and features of its smarter big sibling (the Nest Learning Thermostat), and it wants to use the Google Home app instead of the more intuitive and feature-rich Nest app used by the Learning model. The installation prompts send you straight into scheduling, so prepare for that.\nFactors to consider when choosing a smart thermostat\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for a traditional standard thermostat, there isn\u2019t much to consider. What does it look like? Can you program it? Does it have that cool old-fashioned dial?\nWhen shopping for a smart thermostat, there are a lot more options and some things one person may love while the next person may hate. Here\u2019s what we think is important to consider.\nSmart home integration\nSmart thermostats all come with some kind of app or option to control the device from your phone. If you have a particular affinity for one smart home family or another, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re getting a thermostat that will work in conjunction with your other devices. Most smart thermostats will take voice commands from Amazon\u2019s Alexa, but if the rest of your home is running on, say, Apple\u2019s HomeKit, not every device will provide support.\nMake sure you\u2019re getting something that will play nice with the rest of your smart home.\nGeofencing\nFor the most part, your thermostat\u2019s job is to keep your home comfortable. That means you don\u2019t necessarily need it to be the perfect temperature when you aren\u2019t home. Many smart thermostats feature geofencing, meaning they can track whether or not you\u2019re home and set their expectations accordingly.\nSome devices track occupancy based on the phones of those in the household, while others combine that feature with other occupancy sensors. The good thing is that you can set limits around this feature: Do you want it to change the temperature when you\u2019re away? How far away do you have to be for it to kick in? What temperature limits should there be if you aren\u2019t home? The latter is important if you have pets. You don\u2019t want the cats sweltering or freezing while you\u2019re at work.\nHow smart do you want your thermostat to be?\nEveryone wants a different level of control over their thermostat. Some people want to decide at every moment what the temperature should be. (In that case, you can also consider a basic Wi-Fi-enabled programmable thermostat like the Honeywell Home RTH6580WF, which doesn\u2019t have as many smart features as its more expensive peers but can be adjusted from your phone.)\nSome smart thermostats can be too smart for their own good. One of the most common complaints I\u2019ve heard is that some products will hold the temperature you set them to only for a little bit, and then they\u2019ll revert to what the thermostat believes the temperature should be. If that would annoy you, focus on the ones that offer you the most control.\nInstallation and HVAC compatibility\nRead my full guide on smart thermostat installation guide here.\nNot all thermostats are installed exactly the same way, but they\u2019re all pretty similar. Expect to need a screwdriver, a pair of pliers capable of moving wires around and potentially a drill and a level. Installation is pretty simple once you\u2019ve done it once or twice: Turn off the power, mark the wires, take off the old one, wire the new one and put the thermostat up.\nYou\u2019ll want to watch out for two potential complications: First, does your system have a C-wire? There are usually five or so wires that come out of your wall to connect a thermostat. The older wires tend to carry just enough electricity to power an old-school thermostat. Smarter devices, which can tell you the weather or maybe play your playlist and need an internet connection, need more power than that. This is achieved through a C-wire, designed to carry more electricity to the thermostat. Not every home is wired with one, but if you don\u2019t have one, you have a couple of choices.\nThe first is to get a thermostat that doesn\u2019t require a C-wire. This is where the Nest thermostats are set apart because they\u2019re capable of charging their batteries off the other wires. The second option is to install an adapter kit. This involves adding a device to your HVAC system that converts one of the existing wires into a C-wire. Fortunately, most smart thermostats we\u2019ve looked at that require a C-wire come with these kits. If not, you can pick one up for under $25.\nThe second installation complication is seeing if your thermostat requires any high-voltage wires. This is most common for thermostats that power older electric furnaces or electric baseboard heaters. Today's smart thermostats can support high voltage wiring or those heating devices until you upgrade your system. High-voltage wires are usually labeled and support current at 120 volts or more.\nExternal sensors\nYour thermostat knows what the temperature is because it has a thermometer inside of it. The device\u2019s understanding of the temperature inside is usually limited to the temperature exactly where you mounted it to the wall. What about that stuffy bedroom?\nMany smart thermostats come with or are at least able to connect to separate room sensors. These room sensors allow you to train the thermostat to keep your house as comfortable as possible throughout the home. With external sensors, thermostats can target an individual room and get it to a comfortable temperature at a certain time (the bedroom at night, the home office during the day, etc.) or find a setting that makes everywhere as comfortable as possible, not just the room with the thermostat in it. Some even have proximity sensors in their room sensors, meaning they can tell when a room is occupied or not.\nHow we test smart thermostats\nMost of the home energy products we test and evaluate here at CNET have a lot of numbers attached to them: the efficiency of solar panels and the power output of batteries. Not so with smart thermostats. All of these thermostats can perform the basic functions of turning your heater on when it\u2019s cold and your AC on when it\u2019s hot. Some of our scoring is based on tangible, mathematical data, but it\u2019s mostly about the myriad ways you can interact with the thermostat to get the comfort level and energy savings you want.\nWe\u2019ve experimented, tested and handled each of the thermostats mentioned on this list, including installing them on a testing rig that simulates a standard HVAC system, programming them and trying their various features.\nThe 10-point scores we give smart thermostats are based on these metrics:\n- 20% is based on the available smart home connectivity and other features, including geofencing and external room sensors.\n- 20% is the price, with a formula that rewards less expensive products. Our methodology takes into account the price of any included room sensors.\n- 60% is completely subjective, based on our assessment of what the device offers, how easy it is to install, how easy the app or interface is to use and what features it has that might be non-standard for thermostats but helpful or useful for consumers.\nChoosing a thermostat is an incredibly subjective and personal choice, and our goal in scoring is to highlight those products that do the most and do them well. Your buying decision should focus on your priorities, which might not align exactly with ours, so be sure to look at more than just a score when choosing a device you will probably interact with almost every day.\nSmart thermostat privacy and security\nSince smart thermostats use a variety of sensors to monitor your activity, you may have privacy concerns. I dig deep into thermostat privacy in this guide, but the bottom line is that there isn't too much to worry about. Smart thermostats can't \"watch\" you or record video of your home, only get a broad sense of when people are moving around and when a house is still. Companies typically log data on how the thermostat and app are used, like when the thermostat begins an automatic temperature change and when it's manually altered.\nThermostat brands use that info for product analysis as well as marketing efforts. Within limitations, they may give it to third parties if you consent. Remember, if you use a voice assistant, it's probably recording your temperature commands for later analysis unless you have voice assistant settings to turn that option off.\nWhat we've updated\nSpring 2025: I added the Ecobee Essential model as an excellent budgets option for those who want more features than the absolute cheapest thermostats, but still want to save a lot on initial costs. Also, I made sure that our Honeywell Home picked was the latest T10 version that integrates with Resideo whole-home air quality equipment."

      "text": "Midsummer is the hottest time of the year, and 2025 is no exception. With massive heat waves and record-breaking temperatures happening across the US, your air conditioner is probably running nonstop to keep your home cool. However, running your AC constantly can skyrocket your electricity bill, and for families on a tight budget, this can be unsustainable.\nBut there are smarter ways to stay cool without breaking the bank, so before you reach for the thermostat again, check out these tips that will help keep your home cooler and your electric bill under control all summer long.\nFor more, we also recommend investing in a smart plug or a smart thermostat, adjusting the temperature of your thermostat and installing weatherstripping to save extra cash.\n1. Sign up for an energy audit\nIf your home isn't brand new, the cold air inside is probably seeping out through doors and windows with spotty seals, a poorly insulated attic and other locations of sneaky cracks.\nTo see how well your home is holding in the cold, sign up for a home energy audit with your utility provider or a local contractor. A certified home energy rater or auditor will check your home for leaks and recommend the best way to make your home more energy-efficient.\nDon't want to spring for an audit? You can do a DIY audit instead. Stand outside your home and run your hand around the windows and doors. Can you feel the cold air escaping? If you do, caulk around leaky windows and add insulation around doors.\n2. Get a smart thermostat\nIf you haven't upgraded to a smart thermostat -- such as one by Ecobee or Nest -- it might be time to make a change. Smart thermostats can regulate heating and cooling when you're not home to save money. Plus, you can adjust the settings remotely using an app on your phone or via voice commands. Here's our list of the best smart thermostats to help you make the best decision for your home.\n3. Check the placement of your thermostat\nThermostat placement can play a big part in how well your air conditioner works. If you put the thermostat on a wall right next to a hot window, for instance, your air conditioner will kick on much more often than it needs to because your thermostat will think the room is hotter than it actually is. Here's how to pick the perfect wall for your thermostat and the ideal temperature you should set it to. You can also consider a smart thermostat that comes with extra room sensors, allowing it to keep track of the temperature throughout your home.\n4. Close the blinds\nA window letting in the hot sun won't just heat up your thermostat, it'll heat you up, too. During the warmest part of the day, close your blinds to keep out the sun. It can also help insulate your windows, which stops the cold air from escaping. There are also special insulating blinds, curtains and drapes that can keep your home even cooler.\n5. Try a ceiling fan\nYou don't always need to amp up the AC to feel cooler. Using a ceiling fan can make a room feel cooler, enough that you can increase the thermostat temperature by 4 degrees \"with no reduction in comfort.\" If you want to get high-tech, you can install a smart ceiling fan that connects to an app and automatically adjusts based on schedules you create. Just make sure your fan is rotating counterclockwise in the summer to get the most benefit.\n6. Increase the temperature\nTo save the most money, always set your thermostat to the highest temperature you can comfortably stand. A programmable thermostat makes it easy to keep your AC at the right temperature. You can program the unit to hold at higher temperatures while you're at work and cool down right before you get home.\nYou can save 10% a year on your cooling bills by setting your thermostat just 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit higher for 8 hours each day, according to the Nebraska Energy Office. The US Department of Energy recommends aiming for an indoor temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit when you're at home. If 78 degrees isn't doable for you, even a small change in temperature can knock your energy bill down by up to 3% annually.\nFor more energy savings, explore our home sustainability cheat sheet full of eco-friendly tips and read about how you can save money by unplugging certain appliances when not using them."

      "text": "Do you pay the same for electricity in the evening as you do in the morning? A lot of Americans do, and you can either take advantage of it or face unwelcome surprises.\nWhen you get your electricity bill every month, you're probably not thinking about what it took to generate that power and deliver it to your home. More likely, you take one look at the total cost, grumble because it's too high, and pay it anyway.\nBut if your utility uses time-of-use rates, you could be missing out on an opportunity. Not all electricity is created equal, and your utility might be encouraging you to use power at off-peak hours. With utility bills on the rise, especially in the past few years, any opportunity for a lower bill might bring some much-needed relief.\nCan solar panels save you money?\nInterested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we\u2019ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.\n\"It's an important concept for people to start to understand, because there's real money to save,\" said Pamela Frank, vice president of Gabel Associates, an energy consulting firm.\nHere's everything you need to know about how time-of-use rate plans work, how they can save you money and what risks they entail.\nHow do time-of-use rates work?\nTime-of-use rates are straightforward: An electricity provider can charge you different rates for power depending on what time of day you're using it.\nAt peak hours (usually afternoons and evenings), power is more expensive because it's in high demand. At off-peak hours, the rates drop, making electricity cheaper.\nMost people don't notice this, because they receive one bill at the end of the month with one rate. But some utility companies allow customers to choose a time-of-use rate plan instead, where their costs will vary based on when they used the power.\n\"What time-of-use does for customers is it gives them a little more agency over the price they're going to pay for electricity,\" Frank said.\nWhy are time-of-use rates necessary?\nUtilities use time-of-use rates for a simple reason: \"It costs different amounts of money to generate electricity at different times of the day,\" said Frank.\nIt's the basic idea of supply and demand. The higher the demand for electricity, the more utilities will charge to supply it.\n\"There are peak times of usage when it just costs more money to generate electricity,\" Frank explained. \"Summer days, summer weekdays typically between the hours of, let's say, 4 to 8 p.m., is typically a time of peak usage on the grid generally, and that's because people are coming home, they're cranking up their A/C, they're cooking, they're using their appliances. \u2026 At those times, electricity is quite expensive to generate.\"\nHow do time-of-use rates affect solar panels?\nIf you've got solar panels on your roof, time-of-use rates can offer even more benefits, but they can also make things more complicated.\nMany solar customers are familiar with net metering, in which extra electricity generated from the panels is sold back to the utility, allowing you to save even more on -- or make a profit from -- your utility bill.\nIf your solar panels are generating excess electricity during peak hours, time-of-use rates could bump up your net-metering compensation considerably. The problem is, those timelines don't always line up: Peak hours are usually late afternoon, while peak solar production is earlier in the day, according to Frank.\nOne way to make up for this mismatch is to invest in a home battery, which allows you to store lots of solar energy earlier in the day. You can then use it at night during peak hours, so you won't have to draw the priciest electricity from the grid.\nHow to save money with a time-of-use rate plan\nIf you opt into a time-of-use rate plan, start thinking more strategically about how and when you use power.\nThe utility will charge you less for electricity in off-peak hours, but consequently more during peak hours, so you want to make sure you know what those windows are for your specific electricity provider.\nThe best time, then, to use major appliances (like an electric stove or laundry machine) is during off-peak hours. You'll also want to try to cool your home and crank up that A/C before peak hours kick in. On the flip side, try to avoid using those big appliances in the late afternoon and evening.\n\"For some customers, that's going to work great,\" Frank said. \"It's a question about lifestyle.\""
