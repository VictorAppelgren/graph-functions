  "content": "The Miami Hurricanes kick off the 2025 season on Aug. 31 with a marquee matchup against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at Hard Rock Stadium (7:30 p.m., ABC).\n\nWith the calendar officially flipped to August, the Miami Herald is counting down 30 of the most important players on the Hurricanes\u2019 roster, one per day leading up to the season opener, to provide a closer look at the team heading into coach Mario Cristobal\u2019s fourth season.\n\nToday: The No. 25 player on our list, Damari Brown.\n\nWhat to know\n\nHow he got to Miami: 2023 recruiting class\n\nKey stats: 16 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss in 11 games (five starts)\n\nIn summary: Damari Brown was primed to be a full-time starter for the Hurricanes in 2024, but a foot injury sustained in the Hurricanes\u2019 season-opener against the Florida Gators derailed his season. Brown, a former standout at Plantation American Heritage, is now fully healthy and is expected to be in Miami\u2019s cornerback rotation. He can play either the boundary or the nickel depending on what UM needs and how the depth chart shakes out although it looks like most of his playing time would likely come outside. OJ Frederique Jr. and Xavier Lucas figure to be the Hurricanes\u2019 starting cornerbacks on the outside, with Brown and Ethan O\u2019Connor also in the mix for rotation time. Keionte Smith and Charles Brantley are the two primarily in the mix for time in the nickel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to get to my game play shape, top-tier form, but I feel like everything\u2019s coming back slowly. I haven\u2019t lost speed, skill or anything like that.\u201d - Damari Brown on his health since recovering from injury\n\n\u201cJust really for myself, [I] just [want] to prove that I am who I am. Obviously I\u2019ve got to come to prove to you guys that I\u2019m still Damari Brown. I have a lot in the tank that I\u2019ve yet to show. I feel like I\u2019m one of the best guys out but I have to showcase it.\u201d - Damari Brown on his expectations for the season\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a question mark on our secondary \u2014 there kind of usually is year in and year out, but I feel like I have real good confidence, especially now that I\u2019m back joining the guys. I can vouch and speak for us that it\u2019ll be different.\u201d - Damari Brown on the secondary\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to have him in Miami and have a chance to coach him and develop him. He\u2019s been banged up, but throughout the spring he\u2019s gotten better. All medical staff have done a great job is just trying to get him back. And he\u2019s been building confidence. He\u2019s made some plays. What you want to see with a guy that has a lot of football experience is how you go about your business every day to be a pro. And he\u2019s been attacking.\u201d - Defensive backs coach Zac Etheridge during spring practices on Damari Brown\n\nThe rest of the series",
