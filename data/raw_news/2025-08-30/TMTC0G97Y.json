  "title": "Bill Belichick\u2019s girlfriend applies to trademark phrase \u2018gold digger\u2019",
  "description": "Jordon Hudson, who is nearly 50 years younger than the legendary American football coach, said the application would protect her \u2018brand\u2019",
  "content": "The 24-year-old girlfriend of Bill Belichick has applied to trademark the phrase \u201cgold digger\u201d. Jordon Hudson has moved to cash in on her controversial relationship with the legendary American football coach, 73, on behalf of her company, Trouble Club Enterprises. She filed the application, which cost $350, to protect her \u201cbrand\u2019s unique identity\u201d. It is just one of a raft of trademark applications she has submitted. Others include \u201cBelestrator\u201d, \u201cBelecast\u201d and \u201cChapel Bill\u201d \u2013 in a nod to Belichick\u2019s current job as coach of the American football team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nEyebrows have been raised at the relationship, which began in 2023, given that she is nearly 50 years younger than the father-of-three who divorced his wife of 29 years in 2006. Belichick was subsequently romantically involved with Linda Holliday, the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation, for 16 years. Ms Hudson is not only Belichick\u2019s girlfriend, but she also manages his business and media affairs. The news of their relationship overshadowed the appointment of Belichick, the winner of six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots, at Chapel Hill.\n\nIt triggered a row with CBS when a long-planned interview to promote his book went awry, after Belichick was \u2013 much to his fury \u2013 asked about his romance with the former cheerleader. \u201cPrior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cUnfortunately, that expectation was not honoured during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centred on the book. \u201cAfter this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion.\u201d According to People magazine, Ms Hudson, a former beauty queen and model, preferred dating older men because she didn\u2019t like the way she had been treated by her contemporaries. One of her previous boyfriends was Joshua Zuckerman, a 65-year-old businessman. \u201cBoys her age can be pigs\u2026 I can understand she wants to be treated more than just a sexual relationship and to have a connection,\u201d one friend said.\n\nFriends dismissed claims she had become involved with Belichick for his money, whose salary at Chapel Hill is a reported $10 million a year. They said she had a net worth of $1-2 million before she met Belichick on a plane in 2021. Ms Hudson is hardly the first young woman to be accused of being a gold digger after marrying a man decades her senior. Anna Nicole Smith, a stripper, was just 24 when she wed 89-year-old oil tycoon J Howard Marshall. He died 13 months later, leaving his fortune to his son \u2013 although she successfully challenged the will in court.",

Hudson also manages Belichick's business affairs and has a history of trademark filings. The couple's romance, beginning in 2023, has drawn criticism due to the age gap and allegations of financial motives. The relationship has also caused friction with media, notably a CBS interview where Belichick wanted to focus on his book. Despite the backlash, Hudson maintains that she seeks genuine connection rather than monetary gain.",
