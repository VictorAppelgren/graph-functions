      "summary": "Gamers Nexus, a popular tech‑review channel, released a documentary exposing illegal sales of Nvidia GPUs to China, which led Bloomberg to file a copyright strike over a Trump press‑conference clip. The strike temporarily removed the video, sparking a debate over fair use, corporate influence, and the broader U.S. export‑control regime that limits high‑performance AI chips to China. The incident highlights tensions between content creators, media conglomerates, and national‑security policy, while underscoring the strategic importance of GPU supply chains for AI development.",
