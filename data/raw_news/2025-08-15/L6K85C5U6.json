Then the Opposite Happened The Wishbone Kitchen star \u2014 who covers PEOPLE's 2025 Spring Entertaining issue \u2014 is inspiring a new generation to cook, one video at a time By Ana Calderone Ana Calderone Ana Calderone is the Senior Editor, Special Integrated Projects at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2013. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 10, 2025 09:37AM EDT Leave a Comment Meredith Hayden is playing a game of This or That on-set of her PEOPLE cover shoot when she\u2019s met with an impossible choice: Ina Garten or Martha Stewart? \u201cDon't tell her,\u201d she whispers, as if her second choice is in the room. Then gives her answer: \u201cMartha.\u201d The truth is Hayden, 29, a content creator and soon-to-be cookbook author better known as Wishbone Kitchen to her followers (2.3 million on TikTok alone), has been a longtime fan of both lifestyle stars. \u201cI literally modeled my career off of theirs,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know when you're applying for jobs and you see a company you really like, you find someone on LinkedIn that works at that company, and you kind of go through their history. Where did they go to college? What internships did they have? What jobs did they have before that job? I want to get that job, but how did they get there? I literally did that with Ina and Martha.\u201d Oscar de la Renta dress. Alexandre Birman shoes. Ara Vartanian rings. Caroline Tompkins Garten and Stewart each started out by opening a specialty food store and a catering business in the Hamptons and \u201cwere able to turn that experience into flourishing cookbook careers,\u201d says Hayden. \u201cWriting cookbooks was always my goal.\u201d Her equivalent was applying for a private chef position in that same high-end beach town after graduating from culinary school in 2019. \u201cI was like, \u2018I guess I could figure that out. They did it, and they got to where they are. So maybe if I do it, I could find a way to get there too.\u2019 \u201d And get there she has. On May 6 Hayden will release one of the most highly anticipated spring titles, The Wishbone Kitchen Cookbook, her first with a publishing company after releasing two self-published cookbooklets. The Wishbone Kitchen Cookbook joins her growing business empire, which also includes strategic brand partnerships on her social media pages, collaborations with stars like Jason Momoa and Kelly Clarkson, a Substack and a YouTube show, which recently had its name and theme allegedly copied by Bon App\u00e9tit. Her influence \u2014 stemming from the viral \u201cday in the life\u201d video diaries she filmed during her private-chef days \u2014 is vast. \u201cThe lore that Meredith carries into our generation inspires so many,\u201d says Sage Cofone, 26, a rising lifestyle influencer who looks up to Hayden. \u201cFrom her recipes to her unique hosting tips, she has the ability to make her audience feel like they're right beside her in the kitchen, from the comfort of their own home. Whether I'm grilling outside on a hot summer day or curating the perfect dinner party menu, I always refer back to her content and think, \u2018What would Meredith do?\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cShe is my ultimate comfort creator.\u201d Altuzarra dress. Alexandra Beth Fine Jewelry necklace & earrings. ZAXIE rings. Cartier bracelet. David Yurman bracelet. Caroline Tompkins It\u2019s easy to see why she captivates an audience (and nabs multiple magazine covers, including Better Homes & Gardens). Hayden brings sharp humor to the kitchen, has impeccable style (a red Gucci coat she purchased on a trip to Paris inspired plenty of envious TikTok chatter) and is always learning a new skill that she can then document for a video. On-set with PEOPLE, she casually mentions needlepoint and drapery as her latest side quests. \u201cPeople are always like, \u2018Oh, she's so Martha.\u2019 Because I'm blonde and from New Jersey, and I like to cook and have dinner parties,\u201d she says. \u201cI'm like, \u2018Okay, well, I\u2019m my own person.\u2019 \u201d She feigns annoyance before coming to a realization. \u201cWe have different hobbies, probably \u2014 maybe not, but we could. We actually, definitely don't. I don't know,\u201d she says with a laugh. Hayden first realized she had a knack for entertaining in college at Clemson University, where she was studying marketing. \u201cI started cooking in high school and threw my first dinner parties in high school. But it wasn't until I had roommates in college where I saw what I would make for dinner and what everyone else would do, and I would be like, \u2018Yikes. Maybe I am good at this,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like it came more naturally to me.\u201d The need to feed was passed down by her mom, Nancy, while growing up in Wyckoff, N.J. (home of the Jonas Brothers, Hayden is quick to point out). \u201cMy mom would make us a roast chicken every week for dinner, and when she would carve the roast chicken, she would save the wishbone for me and her,\u201d says Hayden. \u201cThen at the end of dinner, when we were cleaning up, we would pull it apart, and whoever got the bigger half got to make a wish.\u201d The memory served as the inspiration for her moniker. Oscar de la Renta dress. Alexandre Birman shoes. Ara Vartanian rings. Caroline Tompkins Still, after college Hayden briefly explored the fashion industry, working as a marketing intern for Tommy Hilfiger \u2014 and kept cooking as just a hobby. But she quickly learned, \u201cI was a really bad intern. The corporate life was not made for my brain.\u201d So she pivoted, enrolling at the Institute of Culinary Education. A restaurant job followed before she landed her gig as designer Joseph Altuzarra\u2019s private chef, cooking for his family in New York City during the winter and in the Hamptons on weekends in the summer. \u201cShe was so young and yet so poised,\u201d Altuzarra tells PEOPLE of his first impression of Hayden in 2020. \u201cIn a lot of ways, I don't think she has changed much since her career really took off. She has remained very grounded, generous and open-hearted.\u201d Hayden chronicled her stunning work environment and extensive menus like duck confit and peanut butter chocolate cake (two of Altuzarra\u2019s favorites) for three years before stepping away from the job that made her a star. With financial freedom, thanks to brand deals, Hayden could dedicate her time to content creation and writing The Wishbone Kitchen Cookbook. \u201cI was afraid everyone was going to hate me,\u201d she says of quitting. \u201cYou follow this person because they're posting XYZ type of videos, and all of a sudden things change. And the hope is that people continue following because they like you for you. And while I'm not cooking for other people for money, I am cooking for other people for fun. And thankfully a lot of people who follow me seem to still be hanging around.\u201d Oscar de la Renta dress. Alexandre Birman shoes. Ara Vartanian rings. Caroline Tompkins The backdrop of her videos has changed but not all that much. In October Hayden purchased her own Hamptons home for $2.8 million. \u201cWe have to rip the roof off and put a new one on, but we knew that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe house is from 1870, and I love it. It's like a living piece of history, and I'm just so excited to make it my own. Slowly but surely, that's kind of the approach I'm taking. Still, whenever I go there, I don't even fully process that it's my house, but I'm sure as we continue to make it mine and add my own personal touches, it'll start feeling more like home.\u201d Like with many influencers, Hayden\u2019s fans are just as invested in her personal relationships as they are in her recipes. When Hayden posted that she broke up with her boyfriend around the time she bought her new home, online commenters assumed the worst. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Yeah, the breakup was really messy because they bought that house together,\u2019 \u201d she recalls. \u201cI'm like, \u2018You guys, stop.\u2019 \u201d In reality Hayden had purchased the converted barn on her own (with her parents\u2019 stamp of approval) and had kept their breakup a secret for six months. Oscar de la Renta dress. Alexandre Birman shoes. Ara Vartanian rings. Caroline Tompkins \u201cI wanted to process that on my own, and I definitely recommend it to anybody going through a breakup,\u201d she says. \u201cI can't imagine dealing with my own emotions plus input from strangers.\u201d Since things ended with her boyfriend \u2014 whom she only ever publicly referred to as \u201cchicken man\u201d because of the roast chicken recipe she used to impress him with early on \u2014 Hayden makes it clear that she\u2019s not ready to step back into dating right now. \u201cI'm open to talking to people in a social setting. I'm not an ice queen, but I'm not seeking out another relationship, for sure.\u201d Instead, Hayden is raising her Bernese mountain dog Poppy and looking forward to hosting dinner parties as the weather warms up (get her spring party guide below and exclusive recipes from The Wishbone Kitchen Cookbook here), and she remains laser-focused on her career. Asked if she can pinpoint a moment when she realized she had \u201cmade it,\u201d she struggles for a minute. \u201cI don't know. I think it's still happening right now,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe right now, this interview. This is the moment.\u201d Meredith\u2019s Guide to Entertaining Start with Simple Decor \u201cI try not to buy table decor for specific occasions or specific seasons, because then you just have a bunch of holiday stuff that you can only use once a year,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to stick to a white linen tablecloth, a neutral place mat, and then dress it up with fun little card holders or candles and switch those out, so then your base can meld with the seasons.\u201d Make It Pop \u201cI love when the table is just bursting with different colors from all different vegetables,\u201d says Hayden. She compliments the food with bright flowers. Peonies, poppies and tulips are all favorites. \u201cHydrangeas are also great because they're so big and billowy that you don't need a ton, and you could just pick up a bunch from Trader Joe's, and it fills a whole vase.\u201d Max Mara dress. Alexandra Beth Fine Jewelry necklace & earrings. ZAXIE rings. David Yurman bracelet. Olympia Le-Tan clutch. Caroline Tompkins Take Store-Bought Shortcuts \u201cMaybe since I was a private chef for my profession, whenever I'm with my actual friends, I'm wanting to spend the time with my friends, and it's like my time off. So I try to find as many semi-homemade, store-bought sort of opportunities as I can. I'm famous for inviting friends over on a weeknight and just ordering a bunch of sushi, but then dressing it up with different accoutrements.\u201d Know Your Crowd \u201cIf I\u2019m hosting my best friends that I've been friends with since kindergarten, there's no end time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's just like, \u2018Come over.\u2019 But if it's a more mixed crowd, I think people like direction, and people like to know what I can anticipate out of the evening. \u2018Okay, it's 7 to 9.\u2019 But I don't think you have to include an end time.\u201d Set Boundaries as a Host \u201cIf you're over 30 minutes late, I find that not fashionably late. So I would say the sweet spot would be 15 to 20 minutes. But I hate when people get there early, which is funny because I used to love it when my friends would come over, and we would all get ready together, but then I realized it was just too distracting. I'm like, \u2018I have stuff to do. You guys have to leave.\u2019 \u201d Send Guests Home With Leftovers \u201cI like to get little deli containers or cardboard takeout containers before I have a dinner party so that I can give them to people, instead of putting stuff into Tupperware,\u201d she says. \u201cI just put it directly into these takeout containers, and I shove it in people's purses as they leave because I'm like, \u2018This is your responsibility now.\u2019 \u201d Practice, Practice, Practice \u201cMy biggest piece of advice is to accept failure as part of the process, because a lot of people are like, \u2018How are you so good at cooking?\u2019 And I'm like, \u2018Talk to me 10 years ago, I was not good.\u2019 It's something you have to learn. It's kind of like if you want to run a marathon, you can't just wake up one day and run a marathon. You have to practice, and you have to have those days where you run really slowly or you don't run the whole distance you were supposed to. For cooking, you burn this and you overcook that, and whatever. I could give as much advice in terms of how not to burn this, but my advice isn't going to stick as much as your failure will.\u201d Credits Photographer Caroline Tompkins Cinematographer Josh Herzog Hair Romina Manenti / Home Agency Makeup Taylor Fitzgerald Manicurist Kylie Kwok / Tracey Mattingly Stylist Arnold Milfort / The Only Agency Prop Stylist Suzy Zietzmann Food Stylist Jamie Kimm Leave a Comment Read more: From the Magazine Digital Covers"

      "text": "Meet Meredith Hayden: the TikToker Who Spends $2,000 on Groceries as a Private Chef in the Hamptons Meredith Hayden, the creator behind WishBoneKitchen on TikTok, takes her followers inside her life as a private chef By Antonia DeBianchi Antonia DeBianchi Antonia DeBianchi is an Associate Editor, Food & Lifestyle, at PEOPLE. Their work has previously appeared in the Kitchn, TODAY Digital and Insider. People Editorial Guidelines Published on July 19, 2022 02:56PM EDT Credit : Meredith Hayden Meredith Hayden's love of cooking runs deep. Known as \"WishBoneKitchen\" on TikTok, the 26-year-old chef started posting videos of her always-fresh dishes less than two years ago and has already gained nearly one million followers. A main reason foodies are drawn to her page? Hayden often chronicles her crazy hours as a private chef in the Hamptons, New York's high-end beach towns. Most of her videos have fun stories behind them \u2014 and so does her username. \"The inspiration behind me getting into cooking has always been my mom. She was a fabulous cook growing up. And once a week, she would make us a roast chicken for dinner, and she would always save the wishbone when she would carve the chicken,\" Hayden tells PEOPLE. \"And after dinner, we would do the thing where you pull the wishbone in half, and whoever gets the bigger half gets to make a wish. I just have really fond memories of being in the kitchen with my mom.\" Once she graduated college, Hayden took her affinity for cooking up a notch. She started working in marketing full-time while completing culinary school in the evenings. In 2020, Hayden landed her first private chef gig \u2014 and started posting day-in-the-life videos of all the meals she cooks. During the off-season (fall, winter and spring) she preps for the family she works for once a week, stashing a week's worth of meals in the fridge. But during the summer season, she lives in their Hamptons home, commuting from New York City every weekend. Meredith Hayden From jalape\u00f1o creamed corn to lobster cobb salad, Hayden serves up fresh summer meals all season. Since she makes breakfast, lunch and dinner on the weekends, her days are very packed. \"My typical schedule is I'll take the train out on Friday, and I'll arrive Friday at 2 p.m. And then I'll go to the grocery store,\" she says. \"I try to get as many things as I can for the weekend, so I don't have to make too many more trips. And I [always] want to get seafood fresh.\" The multi-course meals she prepares don't come at a small cost. \"On a weekend that I'm serving 8 to 10 people, I'll spend $1,500 to $2,000,\" she says. \"But I also make sure to make a bunch of leftovers because they like to have the leftovers there after I leave.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free weekly newsletter to get the biggest news of the week delivered to your inbox every Friday. While she only cooks dinner on Friday, her Saturdays can get pretty hectic. \"Usually Saturdays are the killer days because I'll do breakfast, I'll do lunch, I'll do a happy hour snack around 3 or 4 p.m. and then I'll do dinner and dessert,\" she says. A typical day for Hayden starts with cooking breakfast at 7 a.m. and ends around 9 p.m. after eating dinner with the family and cleaning up. \"They're very go-with-the-flow\u2026 I'll take an hour break in the middle of the day,\" she adds. When it comes to curating menus, she runs ideas by her clients the day before she leaves for the Hamptons. \"I'll usually just pick out recipes that are fresh, and easy to make, but not too simple,\" she says. Some ingredients that are always top of the list, be it for a dinner main or light lunch, are fresh veggies. \"I definitely have to factor in the fact that they have a vegetable garden in the backyard. I always kind of leave the menus very vague and flexible so that when I arrive, if I notice there's a ton of zucchini, then I'll add that to the menu,\" she says. Giada De Laurentiis and Boyfriend Shane Farley Don't Agree on TikTok's 'Healthy Coke' Meredith Hayden Along with her main client, Hayden has grown her employer roster with one-off catering events, including Rebecca Minkoff's book party last summer in the Hamptons and a Sam Edelman corporate event this year. Her first, self-published cookbook, Wishbone Volume 1, featured holiday recipes and her latest, Wishbone Volume 2, focuses on summer meals inspired by those she puts together in the Hamptons.

Hayden is constantly taking inspiration from one of her favorite A-list chefs and even calls herself the \"Walmart Martha Stewart.\" \"I've always been inspired by her journey,\" she says of Stewart. \"I love cooking, but I also love entertaining. I love tablescape design, and I like how she didn't pigeonhole herself as just somebody who makes great recipes, but also somebody who can create a really memorable evening, surrounded by great recipes.\" Close Read more: Lifestyle Food Celebrity Chef"
