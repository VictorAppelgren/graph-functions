  "content": "DEADLINE ALERT: Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Investigates Claims on Behalf of Investors of LifeMD\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $75,000 In LifeMD To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options\n\nIf you suffered losses exceeding $75,000 in LifeMD between May 7, 2025 and August 5, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\n[You may also click here for additional information]\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against LifeMD, Inc. (\u201cLifeMD\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: LFMD) and reminds investors of the October 27, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) Defendants materially overstated LifeMD\u2019s competitive position; (2) Defendants were reckless in raising LifeMD\u2019s 2025 guidance, considering that they had not properly accounted for rising customer acquisition costs in LifeMD\u2019s RexMD segment, as well as for customer acquisition costs related to the sale of drugs designed to treat obesity, including Wegovy and Zepbound; and (3) as a result, Defendants\u2019 statements about LifeMD\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nOn August 5, 2025, after the market closed, LifeMD reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2025. In this announcement, LifeMD announced revised guidance. Among other metrics, LifeMD stated that it was expecting total revenue in the range of $250 to $255 million, compared with previous guidance of $268 to $275 million.\n\nOn this news, LifeMD's stock plummeted 44.8% on August 6, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding LifeMD\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the LifeMD class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/LFMD or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising. The law firm responsible for this advertisement is Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP (www.faruqilaw.com). Prior results do not guarantee or predict a similar outcome with respect to any future matter. We welcome the opportunity to discuss your particular case. All communications will be treated in a confidential manner.",
