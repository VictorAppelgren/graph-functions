      "text": "Jon Gruden said Tuesday that he is eager to discover the truth in a Nevada courtroom about whether commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL leaked emails to the media before Gruden was forced to resign as Raiders head coach in 2021.\n\"I'm looking forward to having the truth come out and I want to make sure what happened to me doesn't happen to anyone else,\" he said in a statement provided to ESPN.\nGruden said he blames the NFL for leaking the emails, which led the league to pressure the Raiders to force him out when the team was 3-1.\n\"The league's actions disrupted the whole season,\" Gruden said. \"We were leading the division at the time, and they completely blindsided me and the team.\"\nHe added, \"What happened wasn't right and I'm glad the court didn't let the NFL cover it up.\"\nGruden's comments came a day after the Nevada Supreme Court sided with him in his lawsuit alleging the NFL leaked damaging emails to the media before he was forced to resign in October 2021.\nIn a 5-2 ruling, the justices did not determine whether the league had leaked Gruden's racist, sexist and anti-gay emails to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times at the time. But they found the league's decision to force Gruden's complaint into closed-door arbitration proceedings overseen by Goodell -- the target of Gruden's civil lawsuit -- was \"unconscionable.\"\nAn NFL spokesperson said Tuesday that the league would petition the Nevada Supreme Court for a rehearing. If that fails, the most likely next venue will be an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nNeither Gruden, nor his lawyer, Adam Hosmer-Henner, would say whether they were inclined to settle the case with the NFL.\nGruden declined to address his coaching future Tuesday. He said last week that he was eager to return to coaching and added: \"I'd die to coach in the SEC.\"\nHosmer-Henner said he was gratified that the Nevada Supreme Court blocked Goodell from overseeing an arbitration proceeding when he is a defendant in a lawsuit.\n\"The NFL's legal position is absurd and will continue to be rejected by every court,\" Hosmer-Henner told ESPN. \"Obviously, the NFL should not be allowed to be the judge of claims against the NFL or force people to comply with contracts that the NFL can unilaterally change any time it wants without notice.\"\nThe five justices of the Nevada Supreme Court ruled Monday that as a former employee, Gruden should not have been bound by an NFL constitution provision mandating arbitration for such complaints. Gruden's leaked emails were sent in 2011 while he was working for ESPN as a \"Monday Night Football\" analyst.\n\"By its own unambiguous language, the NFL Constitution no longer applies to Gruden,\" the five justices wrote. \"If the NFL Constitution were to bind former employees, the Commissioner could essentially pick and choose which disputes to arbitrate.\"\nOn Monday, Hosmer-Henner lauded the Nevada Supreme Court decision, saying it was a victory not just for Gruden but for all employees facing \"an employer's unfair arbitration process.\"\n\"This victory further vindicates Coach Gruden's reputation, and it clears the way to swiftly bringing him full justice and holding the NFL accountable,\" Hosmer-Henner said.\nGruden's lawsuit alleges that Goodell and the league pressured Raiders owner Mark Davis to fire the coach by leaking emails containing offensive comments that Gruden sent about the commissioner and others in the NFL. Gruden resigned from the Raiders in October 2021.\nGruden won at the district court level. The NFL appealed to Nevada's high court after a state judge in Las Vegas in May 2022 rejected league bids to dismiss Gruden's claim outright or to order out-of-court settlement talks that could be overseen by Goodell.\nA year ago, a three-judge panel of the Nevada Supreme Court decided the league could move Gruden's civil case into arbitration that might be overseen by Goodell. Two justices said Gruden knew when he signed a 10-year contract with the Raiders in 2018 that the NFL used arbitration to resolve disputes. The dissenting justice wrote that it would be \"outrageous\" for Goodell to arbitrate a dispute in which he is named as a defendant.\nGruden's lawyers were granted an en banc hearing of all seven Nevada Supreme Court justices, who heard oral arguments last year. All four justices who heard the case for the first time sided with Gruden against the NFL."

I'm a big believer in Jesus Christ, and the enemy is always at work, especially for kids that have potential.\n\"And if kids don't have mentors around them, the enemy can manipulate them at times and make things seem more than what it is and make it seem like they don't have a way out. And that's when you get into kids really isolating themselves.\"\nJohnson encouraged parents to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ in their children to help counter these \"harmful\" elements.\n\"If you're a child of God, nobody can dim that light. So, you were bought at a high price, by the blood of Jesus Christ, so that allows you to be here,\" Johnson said of the effect of Christianity on parenting. \"Being able to have that identity in Christ is everything. It allows them to stay grounded, not that life is going to be perfect if you got church \u2026 but at least you have the proper tools to make things happen.\"\nFALCONS QUARTERBACK KIRK COUSINS REVEALS VERY RELATABLE HAIRCUT EXPERIENCE WITH ONE EXCEPTION\nJohnson cited modern digital devices as a channel for how this negative influence has been imposed on children and prevented them from speaking up and pushing back against \"harmful\" forces in their lives.\n\"The digital devices are making us less personable,\" Johnson said. \"Kids get on those iPhones, and you never know what they see on there. And they don't even purposely have to do it, it's just an attention-getter. \u2026 Now, there's cyberbullying, there's a lot of different ways you can bully somebody and really kill their confidence through social media and whatnot.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAs the son of a veteran teacher, the former linebacker also pointed to a decline in the quality of public education in America.\n\"It's getting worse. And that's why I'm in this fight,\" Johnson said of American public education. \"My mom being a teacher for over 40 years, I know what it means to serve the youth at a high level. \u2026 And, a lot of times, they just need more help and more resources so they can really push the mission.\n\"Public schools are at a standstill. \u2026 We have to put more attention on them, more resources, pumping more money into there and using it the right way, obviously. Not just a dollar amount, but using it in a strategic way.\"\nJohnson is doing his part to try and contribute his experience to American education with his new book \"Super DJ Saves Field Day.\" Johnson said he is already planning to write sequels and create a series.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

A July 2023 ESPN.com article about the leaked emails that forced Gruden to resign asserted that Gruden hopes \u201cto burn the house down.\u201d\nThat can happen only if he first proves who, from a fairly tight circles of people who had access to the supposedly secret emails from the Washington investigation, leaked some to the Wall Street Journal for publication on a Friday and then, when that didn\u2019t do the trick, leaked more to the New York Times on a Monday.

      "text": "Jon Gruden compares Lions' Jared Goff to Joe Montana, wants to coach again in NFL\nJon Gruden isn't done coaching.\nFour years after he resigned in controversy from his job with the Las Vegas Raiders, he's making his rounds again in the NFL.\nGruden visited Detroit Lions training camp Monday in Allen Park, where his good friend and protege John Morton is the team's new offensive coordinator. Gruden reiterated his desire to return to the sidelines as a coach.\n\"Hopefully I'm not done,\" Gruden said. \"I'm about to make a comeback. I'm working hard to maybe get one more shot, but hopefully some of these guys that fell off my branch, if you say it that way, maybe they can hire me cause I'm looking for a job.\"\nAsked how realistic he thinks it is that he'll coach again in the NFL, Gruden said, \"Oh, I don't care about that.\"\n\"I don't care if I coach at Jones Junior High,\" he said. \"I'm going to coach again. I'm still coaching. I'm just not on a team officially, but I do have some private assignments I work on and I wear some gear when I'm watching the games that nobody knows about who I'm pulling for.\"\nGruden resigned as coach of the Raiders in October of 2021 after private emails between him and then Washington general manager Bruce Allen were leaked from Gruden's time as a broadcaster.\nThe emails included homophobic and misogynistic language and were critical of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and others.\nAt least one NFL team reportedly did research on Gruden during its coaching search this offseason, and Gruden worked as a consultant with the New Orleans Saints in 2023. He currently works for Barstool Sports, and said Monday he was grateful coach Dan Campbell allowed him to attend Lions practice.\n\"I just like to see how they operate, honestly,\" Gruden said. \"Watch how they practice. I can learn different drills. I see things that they're doing and it just gets me going. I mean, I wake up in July and August and I get the shakes, you know what I mean? It's just awesome to hear the (pads) popping and the snap count and see the guys struggling physically, fighting through stuff. It's just really, really a great time in my life. I spent most of my life doing this and just really honorable to be back here.\"\nGruden and Morton have a relationship that dates to Morton's playing days in the 1990s, when Morton signed with the Green Bay Packers after being released by the Raiders as a rookie.\nGruden later coached Morton with the Raiders and gave Morton his first coaching job in 1998, when Morton was working in the Raiders' personnel department.\nFellow Lions assistants David Shaw, Mark Brunell, Bruce Gradkowski and Marques Tuiasosopo also played for or worked under Gruden, and Morton, who worked under Gruden with the Raiders in 2019-21, considers Gruden one of his mentors in coaching.\n\"Jon was like the West Coast offense, the Bill Walsh and the Mike Holmgrens on the world, he\u2019s the first one that kind of ventured off, still running the West Coast type of principles, but different formations, shifts, and motions and things like that,\" Morton said. \"So it just opens your eyes to the whole aspect of everything. I thought I knew football but, man, when you \u2014 I mean, he just put me in a room, \u2018Go do this, go do that.\u2019 It was projects one after another, and all of a sudden you start learning football, so it was really cool.\u201d\nMorton spent the 2022 season as a senior offensive assistant with the Lions and helped then-offensive coordinator Ben Johnson build the Lions' playbook.\nHe is calling plays this year for the first time since the 2017 season with the New York Jets. He said Monday he will do so from the coach's box and feels \"very confident\" about that part of the job.\nGruden said he expects the Lions' new offense to include many of the West Coast staples he learned years ago, including lots of condensed formations and pre-snap movement.\n\"He helped put the offense in initially, so Jared (Goff is) going to do a lot at the line of scrimmage,\" Gruden said. \"You're going to hear 'RCE' a lot. I used to have hats made, recognition leads to communication, and if we can do that, we're going to execute at a high level. But I think RCE is the slogan that you're going to hear a lot around here and probably feel like you're seeing a lot.\"\nAs for Goff, Gruden, who spent time talking with Goff and his parents after practice Monday, threw a lofty Joe Montana comparison on the quarterback, and indicated he sees Goff having another big year.\n\"The continuous movement that he plays with, he always reminded me of Montana from the days I was with the 49ers and my dad coached at Notre Dame with Joe,\" Gruden said. \"But there's a similar personality, a similar playing style. He is one tough cat in the pocket. I love Goff.\"\nDave Birkett will appear at the Buy Michigan Now author showcase from 3-8 p.m. Aug. 2 in downtown South Lyon with his book, \"Detroit Lions: An Illustrated Timeline.\" He covers the Lions for the Detroit Free Press.
