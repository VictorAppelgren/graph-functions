  "content": "Attacking midfielder David Brooks, speaking after victory over Tottenham about Bournemouth's start to the season: \"Our win [over Tottenham] was thoroughly deserved. We were the better team for large parts of the game. The only disappointing thing was that we couldn't put more [goals] away.\n\n\"We had opportunities to do so but sometimes you just don't find the back of the net. The win was deserved and it is a massive three points. It always tastes sweeter when it is a team effort.\n\n\"We have shown over the past couple of years that if we compete at the level we know we are capable of, we can beat any team.\n\n\"There is competition in midfield and that is a great headache to have. We are all striving to be in that starting XI, and bringing the likes of [Eli Junior] Kroupi and [Amine] Adli in offers attacking options for us.\n\n\"We have had a very good return from our games so far. If you had asked the gaffer a few weeks ago, he would have taken six points now.\n\nWe could have pinched something from our game against Liverpool as well, but overall it's been a good start.\"\n\nListen to more from Brooks on BBC Sounds",

      "text": "Is Isak 'a very expensive mistake' or the 'quality striker' Reds needpublished at 09:09\nWe asked for your views on the deal for Newcastle's Alexander Isak and whether it is a statement of intent, or an overpriced fee.\nHere are some of your comments:\nSimon: Let's hope the stance he took to get to Liverpool allows him the freedom to continue being a world-class forward. If we get Marc Guehi as well then this team could be the most dominant force in the Premier League.\nPaula: I really hope Isak is a team player as everything I've seen and read over the past six weeks has muddied the water. There is no I in team and he needs to be a team player. Lots of hype to overcome if he's going to fit in, otherwise he's going to be a very expensive mistake!\nSteve: After losing three strikers in Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez and sadly Diogo Jota, Isak is needed to fill the void of goals we have lost. Quality striker is just what we need.\nStuart: Hope I'm wrong, but this feels like a very expensive mistake to me. Not sure he is of the right 'stuff' to be a Liverpool player. No doubt about his finishing prowess, but what of his mental attitude?\nKevin: Before the beginning of the season, I would have felt a lot more excited about this. But with the team playing as they have been, I don't think it's as needed. Other positions are more needed. However, I trust that Arne Slot has a plan with Isak in mind and can see him being a 20-plus goalscorer in no time!\nPaul: There's no doubt Isak is a good striker. My biggest concern, though, is not how well he plays but how he reacts if Real Madrid come looking. Will building a legacy at Liverpool be enough for him or will he down tools again?\nAndy: Time will tell if it's too much money. If he scores plenty of goals then no; if not, then yes. Personally, I think it's too much."
