  "content": "Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $100,000 In Charter To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options\n\nIf you suffered losses exceeding $100,000 in Charter between July 26, 2024 and July 24, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\n[You may also click here for additional information]\n\nNEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Charter Communications, Inc. (\"Charter\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CHTR) and reminds investors of the October 13, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (i) the impact of the ACP end was a material event the Company was unable to manage or promptly move beyond; (ii) the ACP end was actually having a sustaining impact on Internet customer declines and revenue; (iii) neither was the Company executing broader operations in a way that would compensate for, or overcome the impact, of the ACP ending; (iv) the Internet customer declines and broader failure of Charter's execution strategy created much greater risks on business plans and earnings growth than reported; (v) accordingly, the Company had no reasonable basis to state the Company was successfully executing operations, managing causes of Internet customer declines, or provide overly optimistic statements about the long term trajectory of the Company and EBITDA growth; and (iv) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants materially misled with, and/or lacked a reasonable basis for, their positive statements about the Company's business, operations, outlook during the Class Period.\n\nOn July 25, 2025, Charter released its second quarter 2025 financial results, reporting that total internet customers had declined by 117,000, compared to about 100,000 in the second quarter of 2024, when adjusted to remove the prior year's impact of the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program. The Company's total video customers also decreased by 80,000.\n\nOn this news, Charter's stock price fell $70.25 per share, or 18.5%, to close at $309.75 per share on July 25, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Charter's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Charter Communications class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/CHTR or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.
