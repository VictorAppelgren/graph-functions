  "content": "Jennifer Aniston's New Behind-The-Scenes 'Friends' Story Has Fans Feeling Nostalgic originally appeared on Parade.\n\nJennifer Aniston, 56, gave Friends fans a special treat on August 11, 2025, when she remembered filming the hit sitcom's iconic Thanksgiving English trifle scene.\n\n\"The trifle was ridiculous in the best way,\" recalled Aniston in a new interview with Vanity Fair. The scene has Aniston's Rachel Green attempting to make a \"traditional English trifle\" for Thanksgiving, but she runs into trouble when the cookbook's pages stick together. \"She ended up putting beef in the middle of a sweet trifle,\" Aniston recalled.\n\nBut the real hilarity came behind the scenes while trying to shoot the episode without laughing. \"When we shot the scene and came time for everybody to eat the dessert\u2026 They couldn't get through it because they kept making each other laugh,\" she shared, starry-eyed while recalling the fun memory.\n\n\"[Matt] LeBlanc just eats whatever's in front of him, it's not like he fakes it... he really eats it,\" she said. \"Whenever David [Schwimmer] said the line 'It tastes like feet!', that's when they couldn't keep it together. LeBlanc just barrels through, totally into it.\" The moment gave way to the iconic Joey Tribbiani line 'What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooood!\"\n\n\ud83c\udfac SIGN UP for Parade's Daily newsletter to get the latest pop culture news & celebrity interviews delivered right to your inbox \ud83c\udfac\n\n\"This is one of the greatest times.

This is really one of the highlights of my life.\"\n\nFans were both touched and tickled by the silly story, and took to the comments to share their thoughts. \"It\u2019s really telling how thankful she is for every opportunity she\u2019s given and how nostalgic she is for this moment in time with people that she loved,\" said one fan, with another adding, \"We can see the nostalgia in her eyes.\" A third wrote, \"My favorite Friends episode!\"\n\nFans can stream all 10 seasons of Friends on HBO Max.\n\nJennifer Aniston's New Behind-The-Scenes 'Friends' Story Has Fans Feeling Nostalgic first appeared on Parade on Aug 12, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Aug 12, 2025, where it first appeared.",
