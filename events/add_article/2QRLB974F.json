      "summary": "Kevin O’Leary credits his mother for teaching him two key financial habits: keeping separate financial accounts even after marriage to maintain independence, and buying a few high‑quality items that last rather than many disposable ones. He explains how his mother saved 15% of her pay and kept a secret account for herself during her marriages, and how her investment in Chanel suits preserved value over decades. O’Leary applies these lessons to his own wealth strategy, emphasizing financial identity and quality over quantity. The article highlights these principles as enduring lessons for anyone seeking financial stability and long‑term value.",
