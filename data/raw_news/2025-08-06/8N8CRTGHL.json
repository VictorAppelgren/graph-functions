  "description": "A growing tech and health care sector is drawing young professionals to this Michigan metro.",
  "content": "Finding a new job is challenging and takes time. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median duration of unemployment in June 2025 was about 10 weeks. And while that is the median, some job seekers have been on the market for over a year. There is, however, a way to speed up the process, and that's by moving to a city with a fast-growing job market.\n\nOn July 15, LinkedIn released its new list of cities on the rise, which highlights emerging U.S. cities that offer both \"vibrant job markets and growing professional communities.\" And it named the Grand Rapids, Michigan, area the No. 1 spot.\n\n\"A growing tech scene and booming insurance industry are helping Grand Rapids redefine its industrial identity while drawing a wave of young professionals thanks to its growing job market, bustling downtown, and proximity to Lake Michigan,\" reported LinkedIn. It added that the top industries hiring in the area include manufacturing, health care, and professional services, while the top employers are Corewell Health, Grand Valley State University, and Meijer.\n\nHere, workers can expect an average income of $65,235 and an average home listing price of $524,195. This makes the price-to-income ratio of the homes slightly higher; however, according to Apartment Advisor, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,250, a far more affordable option.\n\nOther cities joining Grand Rapids include the Boise metro area in Idaho at No. 2, followed by the greater Harrisburg area in Pennsylvania (third), the Albany metro area in New York (fourth), and the greater Milwaukee area in Wisconsin (fifth).\n\nFor this list, LinkedIn explained that it partnered with Economic Graph to define \"on the rise\" cities, which included migration data, along with \"year-over-year growth across each metric: where talent is landing, where roles are opening, and where people are moving (relative to leaving).\"\n\nLinkedIn also analyzed each destination at the metropolitan area level rather than just the city proper to \"better reflect how people actually live and work today.\" \n\n\n\nLinkedIn has seen job applications grow by 45 percent year-over-year, with 11,000 applications filed per minute, according to a company statement shared with Travel + Leisure.\n\nSee the complete list at linkedin.com",

      "text": "Inside LinkedIn\u2019s Cities on the Rise: How we identified emerging job markets\nLinkedIn just unveiled our inaugural list of Cities on the Rise \u2014 featuring the regions where job market momentum and economic opportunity are growing. Learn more about how we designed the ranking below and check out lists in the U.S., Germany and India.\nIn today\u2019s post-pandemic economy, many mid-sized cities are proving they can compete with the largest metros \u2014 attracting new talent by offering a more affordable cost of living, expanding cultural amenities, greater access to outdoor space and more.\nThis shift is happening alongside another major trend: companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional headquarters hubs to tap into more affordable markets and diverse talent pools.\nThis trend made us ask: Which cities are truly on the rise \u2014 both growing their local labor markets and attracting new talent?\nMeasuring momentum: Behind the metrics\nTo find out, we partnered with our Economic Graph team to define how we would measure \u201con the rise.\u201d While migration data was a natural starting point \u2014 and our data scientists have uncovered insightful trends in where LinkedIn members move \u2014 we knew it wouldn\u2019t tell the whole story. We wanted to expand the lens \u2014 to understand what\u2019s driving those moves and where career momentum is taking hold.\nSo in addition to migration trends, we analyzed where jobs are being posted and where people are actually getting hired. But instead of looking at sheer volume, we focused on year-over-year growth across each metric: where talent is landing, where roles are opening, and where people are moving (relative to leaving). To qualify, a city had to rank in the top 50th percentile in all three areas. This approach helped us highlight cities with real, sustained momentum \u2014 not just the usual big-name markets.\nTo keep the spotlight on emerging metros, we narrowed our scope to mid-sized cities \u2014 excluding those with populations above two and a half million in the U.S. and one million in both India and Germany. (We also did a separate analysis of large U.S. cities, which you can explore here.)\nWe analyzed each city at the metropolitan area level rather than just the city proper to better reflect how people actually live and work today. Job opportunities, housing, and commuting patterns often span across city boundaries \u2014 and focusing only on city limits would have missed the broader economic ecosystems that define a region\u2019s true momentum.\nDiving deeper into local life\nWhile the rankings measure where economic momentum is taking off, our data also helps paint a picture of what it means to live and work in each city. We\u2019re able to highlight which industries and employers are fueling growth on the ground, giving job seekers a view of where demand is rising.\nFor instance, LinkedIn data shows that advanced manufacturing, healthcare and education are key drivers of job growth in many of the ranked U.S. cities. In Colorado Springs (No. 15) and Indianapolis (No. 14), established high-tech and pharmaceutical manufacturers are expanding their presence through major investments. Similarly, durable industries are advancing paths for further growth in cities like Reno (No. 22) and Albany (No. 4), which are emerging as information hubs fueled by tech infrastructure and research institutions. Together, these shifts show that smaller metros aren\u2019t just gaining residents \u2014 they\u2019re becoming magnets for the industries shaping the future of work.\nMajor investment from government and industry is key to many of the cities on the rise in India: infrastructure projects in Visakhapatnam (No. 1) are helping it emerge as a regional economic engine and driving job growth, while Raipur (No. 5) is being positioned as a future innovation hub, with semiconductor and AI firms starting up across the city.\nHigh-tech industries are fundamental to the rise of many cities featured in Germany \u2014 from Dresden's (No. 2) position in \"Silicon Saxony\" with its growing tech and semiconductor sectors, to Heilbronn\u2019s (No. 9) renowned AI-focused innovation park. Pharmaceuticals and research sectors are critical growth drivers in many of the cities featured too, notably Freiburg (No. 3), where the technical university plays an important role as an innovation incubator.\nIn the U.S., to help readers assess the lifestyle and affordability of each city, we partnered with Lyft to uncover the top destinations for local residents, pulled federal insights on average income per capita, and included average home listing prices from Realtor.com.\nFor professionals exploring their next move \u2014 whether it\u2019s a new role or a new city \u2014 Cities on the Rise offers a valuable lens into where economic energy is building and where tomorrow\u2019s opportunities may be taking root.\nCareer Strategist for faculty women who want successful careers without sacrificing your health, wealth or personal relationships | Life, Leadership, and Career Development Coach | Speaker | Best Selling Author\n2wMy advice for clients looking to advance their career or make a change. How do you want to live? Not just how do you want to work? Once you have determined how you want to live. Then begin to look at positions in markets that support your holistic view of life.

Migration is measured by the year-over-year change in the inflow-outflow ratio, or the total number of inflows divided by the total number of outflows, in a given year. The inflow-outflow ratio indicates how many LinkedIn members have entered a metro area for every member who has exited based on the location listed on their profile.\nTo be ranked, a metro area\u2019s hiring, jobs and migration growth rates needed to be within the top 50th percentile or above across all U.S. metro areas, and not exhibit negative net migration over the past year. Metro areas with more than 2.5 million LinkedIn members were excluded to better highlight emerging labor market dynamics in mid-sized and smaller metros.\nThis analysis represents the world seen through the lens of LinkedIn data and is based on anonymized and aggregated datasets analyzing millions of U.S. member profiles and job postings from March 1, 2023 to February 1, 2025.\nCity Insights\nTop hiring industries are based on the industry of the companies that hired the highest share of members in each metro area from March 1, 2023 to February 1, 2025. Top hiring companies are based on the employers that hired the highest number of members in each metro area from March 1, 2023 to February 1, 2025. Average income reflects the per capita personal income for each metropolitan area in 2023, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and is rounded to the nearest five for clarity and uniformity (as in Grand Rapids per capita income of $65,239 is reported as $65,235). Per capita personal income is the total personal income divided by the total mid-year population for a metropolitan statistical area, which are defined by the Office of Management and Budget.

Credit: benedek/Getty Images Finding a new job is challenging and takes time. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median duration of unemployment in June 2025 was about 10 weeks. And while that is the median, some job seekers have been on the market for over a year. There is, however, a way to speed up the process, and that's by moving to a city with a fast-growing job market. On July 15, LinkedIn released its new list of cities on the rise, which highlights emerging U.S. cities that offer both \"vibrant job markets and growing professional communities.\" And it named the Grand Rapids, Michigan, area the No. 1 spot. \"A growing tech scene and booming insurance industry are helping Grand Rapids redefine its industrial identity while drawing a wave of young professionals thanks to its growing job market, bustling downtown, and proximity to Lake Michigan,\" reported LinkedIn. It added that the top industries hiring in the area include manufacturing, health care, and professional services, while the top employers are Corewell Health, Grand Valley State University, and Meijer. Here, workers can expect an average income of $65,235 and an average home listing price of $524,195. This makes the price-to-income ratio of the homes slightly higher; however, according to Apartment Advisor, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,250, a far more affordable option. Other cities joining Grand Rapids include the Boise metro area in Idaho at No. 2, followed by the greater Harrisburg area in Pennsylvania (third), the Albany metro area in New York (fourth), and the greater Milwaukee area in Wisconsin (fifth). For this list, LinkedIn explained that it partnered with Economic Graph to define \"on the rise\" cities, which included migration data, along with \"year-over-year growth across each metric: where talent is landing, where roles are opening, and where people are moving (relative to leaving).\" LinkedIn also analyzed each destination at the metropolitan area level rather than just the city proper to \"better reflect how people actually live and work today.\" LinkedIn has seen job applications grow by 45 percent year-over-year, with 11,000 applications filed per minute, according to a company statement shared with Travel + Leisure.

      "text": "- About 20% of job-seekers have been looking for work for at least 10 to 12 months or longer, according to a new report from Career Group. Both candidates and hiring managers have a hand in why it\u2019s taking so long.\nFor many of those on the job search, sending in job applications can feel like throwing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s into an abyss. Turns out the hunt is as bad as it seems.\nIt can take an absurdly long time to find a job: About 20% of job seekers have been searching for at least 10 to 12 months or longer, according to a new report from Career Group which surveyed 765 candidates across many industries. Most applicants, about 30%, say they\u2019ve been looking for four to six months, while 23% have been on the hunt for two to three months, nearly 17% have been on the prowl for up to one month, and about 7% were seven to nine months deep into the search.\nThe fact that nearly a fifth of professionals have been job-hunting for over a year isn\u2019t surprising. Despite the labor market being relatively strong\u2014the unemployment rate is low right now at 4.1%, and there\u2019s been some job posting growth\u2014there are a litany of horror stories on finding work. One job-seeker said he applied to over 1,700 roles, but didn\u2019t hear a peep from recruiters until venting about the situation on TikTok. In 2024, 40% of unemployed professionals said they didn\u2019t have a single job interview that year, according to a Harris Poll survey.\nFindings like this can be validating for white-collar professionals down on their luck; it can be incredibly isolating and mentally draining sending applications into a black box. There are a few reasons why landing a gig takes so long nowadays, and they fall on job seekers and recruiters alike.\n\u201cIn cases where it takes 10 to 12 months to find a job, there are many variables,\u201d Susan Levine, CEO of Career Group, tells Fortune. \u201cAre candidates realistic? What are their salary expectations? Are they flexible? Are they turning down jobs being offered to them? While the hiring process is taking longer now, that alone wouldn\u2019t explain why it might take several months for a candidate to secure a role.\u201d\nJob seekers\u2019 changing, and sometimes lofty, expectations\nApplicants have the right to be choosy about where they work\u2014after all, they\u2019ll be spending a third of their waking hours on the job. But they may be shooting themselves in the foot being too picky.\nAlthough the share of professionals thinking they\u2019re likely to be unemployed soon hit a record high last year, job-seekers wouldn\u2019t accept less than about $81,500 salary at a new role, according to a 2024 survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It\u2019s understandable that workers want a wage that is comfortable and livable, but it narrows the field of options they can apply to.\nAnd even when job-seekers are turning in their applications, they\u2019re leaving hiring managers high and dry. About 29% of Gen Z and young millennials have \u2018career catfished\u2019 recently, ghosting their prospective bosses after making it to the final interview round, according to 2025 data from PapersOwl. A good chunk did it as a dare, some thought they\u2019d be better off elsewhere, and others admitted they \u201cjust weren\u2019t feeling it.\u201d\nLevine says it\u2019s imperative for job-seekers to be open to new possibilities. After all, careers aren\u2019t always an upward climb, but rather a squiggly path to success.\n\u201cIt is important for candidates in any market to be flexible, open-minded, and excited to explore opportunities,\u201d she says. \u201cThe market is competitive, and to gain an edge, you need to be extremely well-prepared and genuinely invested in learning as much as possible about the companies you\u2019re interested in interviewing at.\u201d\nBut the job-seeking process taking so long for so many can\u2019t fully be pinned on workers. Some eyebrow-raising hiring trends have been on the rise\u2014and they\u2019re out of applicants\u2019 control.\nThe job hunt today: recruiters who ghost you and tons of interviews\nThere\u2019s a reason why so many job-seekers complain about radio silence after sending in their resumes to hundreds of positions: They\u2019re hitting \u2018apply\u2019 on gigs they have no chance of actually landing. About 81% of recruiters say that their employer posts \u201cghost jobs,\u201d gigs that either don\u2019t exist or are already filled, according to a 2024 report from MyPerfectResume. And it\u2019s not just one or two postings that are fake. Around 36% of these hiring managers admit a quarter of their open opportunities are indeed ghost jobs.\nRead more from Fortune\n\u201cCompanies are trying to project, \u2018We\u2019re okay, we\u2019re still maintaining hiring, that we\u2019re still moving in a growth-oriented trend. In this market, our organization is doing well.\u2019 That ties into why these fake jobs might be appearing more,\u201d Jasmine Escalera, a career expert for MyPerfectResume, told Fortune. \u201cIt really is about the business, the bottom line, showing growth, showing trends, and how that can connect to maintaining profit.\u201d\nNot only are recruiters posting ghost jobs, but they\u2019re also expecting more from applicants. It was once considered sacrilegious for a candidate\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to be longer than one page\u2014anything more would be a time-suck for hiring managers. But now, as more are using AI to filter top candidates to the next round, over half of recruiters now want a two-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from applicants, according to a 2024 report from Criteria.\nThey also want to suss out job-seekers for a longer period of time; unemployed professionals have complained about having five, six, seven, or eight interviews before getting an answer. The standard used to be around two or three rounds before an employee is picked. Plus, getting an update between the interviews can take several weeks or months. The process is undoubtedly being dragged out at many companies\u2014it\u2019s turning employees off, and making them abandon hope.\n\u201cWe often hear job-seekers saying, \u2018I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m depressed, I\u2019m desperate,\u2019 using these very harsh words when it comes to the job market,\u201d Escalera said. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why they are losing faith in organizations and companies.\u201d"
