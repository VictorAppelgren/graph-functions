The S&P 500 and Dow futures slipped 0.3%, while oil prices dropped. In Asia, the Nikkei fell 0.3% after weaker factory output and tariff concerns, and Chinese tech stocks saw mixed moves amid government chip support. The U.S. economy grew 3.3% in Q1‑Q2, but job market softness may prompt Fed rate cuts next month.",
