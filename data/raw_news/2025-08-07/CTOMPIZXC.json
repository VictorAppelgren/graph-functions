  "title": "The Latest: US import taxes hit levels not seen in nearly 100 years",
  "description": "President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on goods from dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats begins to create visible damage to the U.S. economy",
  "content": "President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on goods from nearly 100 other nations on Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats begins to create visible damage to the U.S. economy. These taxes, reaching a level not seen in the U.S. in almost 100 years, will have Americans paying an average of 18.3% more for imported products, the highest rate since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.\n\nDespite the immediate impact, the Trump White House is confident businesses will ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.\n\nTrump plans to sign order letting people have crypto, private equity in retirement accounts\n\nThe White House says the president will sign an order that could change the composition of 401(k) plans, letting them invest in cryptocurrencies, private equity funds, real estate and other digital assets previously seen as too risky for everyday Americans approaching retirement.\n\nThe order asks the Labor Department to examine and update its guidance and asks other agencies to determine whether regulatory changes are needed to allow such investments.\n\nCrypto can be extremely volatile, while private equity, real estate investment trusts and certain digital assets have often been for more sophisticated investors without immediate liquidity needs. It\u2019s unclear how adding such investments would affect management fees, which have been trending downward as more 401(k) holders invest in index funds.\n\nTrump wants Census to ignore some people, despite the 14th Amendment\n\nTrump\u2019s Truth Social post directing the Census Bureau to stop counting people seen as living in the country illegally fits his pattern of trying to reshape basic measures of how U.S. society is faring, whether they be monthly jobs figures or how congressional districts are drawn going into the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nBut there could be legal challenges to reshaping the census, which guides the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal funds to the states for roads, health care and other programs.\n\nThe US Supreme Court effectively blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The 14th Amendment says that \u201cthe whole number of persons in each state\u201d should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment, the process of allocating congressional seats and Electoral College votes among the states based on population.\n\nAbout 55% of Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, those super-tasty, energy-dense foods typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, according to a new federal report.\n\nNutrition research has shown for years that ultra-processed foods make up a big chunk of the U.S. diet, especially for kids and teens. For the first time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed those high levels of consumption, using dietary data collected from August 2021 to August 2023. For kids through age 18, it was nearly 62%.\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blames chronic diseases on such foods, saying \u201cwe\u2019re poisoning ourselves.\u201d Many studies have correlated this diet with obesity, diabetes and heart disease, but they haven\u2019t been able to prove they directly cause these chronic health problems.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the CDC report on U.S. ultra-processed food consumption\n\nIndiana governor not yet on board with mid-decade redistricting in state\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike Braun said in a television interview Thursday that he plans to discuss with Vice President JD Vance whether Indiana would redraw its congressional districts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be listening to JD today and our two leaders of the legislature as well, and we\u2019re going to have that discussion,\u201d Braun said on Fox News.\n\nBraun pointed to the Republican-led states of \u201cMissouri, Ohio, Texas and maybe other states\u201d that are looking to redistrict but said that \u201chere, I think we\u2019re going to look at it logically and do what makes sense.\u201d\n\nA group that represents recipients of the military medals honoring service members wounded or killed during enemy action says representatives are at the White House Thursday for a \u201chistoric tribute event\u201d being hosted by Trump.\n\nThe National Purple Heart Honor Mission says medal recipients from conflicts including the Korean War, Vietnam War and Operation Iraqi Freedom will be available for interviews following a late afternoon event with Trump.\n\nThe White House hasn\u2019t publicly given specifics on the event, other than that Trump is giving a speech. National Purple Heart Day is marked annually on August 7.\n\nTrump meeting with Putin would hinge on Putin agreeing to meet Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. president is open to meeting with Putin as soon as next week but such a meeting would not happen if the Russian leader does not agree to meet with Zelenskyy, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official said no location for a Trump-Putin meeting had been determined Thursday morning, and the U.S. still expects to impose secondary sanctions against Russia on Friday.\n\nTrump plans to sign order to stop banks from banning customers based on politics\n\nThe White House says Trump on Thursday will sign an order to ensure that federal agencies \u201cdo not promote activities and practices\u201d that enable banks to restrict their services based on political and religious beliefs.\n\nThe president has said that JPMorganChase and Bank of America rejected his deposits and that his supporters have been denied banking services.\n\nThe order says that financial regulators will remove \u201creputational risk\u201d as a criteria for assessing account holders and that cases of discrimination can be referred to the Justice Department, and that the Treasury Department will develop a strategy to prevent the debanking of people due to politics.\n\nAnalyst: Employers are reluctant to expand \u2014 or reduce \u2014 their payrolls\n\nWhile layoffs remain low by historical standards, there has been noticeable deterioration in the labor market this year.\n\nLast week, the government reported that U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, well short of the 115,000 expected. Worse, revisions to the May and June jobs figures shaved a stunning 258,000 jobs off previous estimates and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018no hire/no fire\u2019 theme in the labor market remains firmly intact,\u201d analysts for Jeffries wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIntel\u2019s stock tumbles after Trump says its CEO must resign\n\nIntel\u2019s shares are tumbling before Thursday\u2019s opening as traders react to a Trump social media post that said \u201cThe CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\u201d Trump posted.\n\nThe president reacted after Sen. Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary expressing concern over CEO Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s investments and ties to semiconductor firms that are reportedly linked to the Chinese Communist Party and the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on Trump\u2019s pressure on Intel Corp.\n\nA modest rise in filings for jobless benefits, despite tariffs uncertainty\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Aug. 2 rose by 7,000 to 226,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday, slightly more than the 219,000 new applications that economists had forecast.\n\nThe report is the first government labor market data release since Trump fired the head of the agency that tallies the monthly jobs numbers after a grim July jobs report that sent financial markets spiraling downward. It suggests employers are still retaining workers despite economic uncertainty related to U.S. trade policy.\n\nThe four-week average of claims, which smooths out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 500 to 220,750. The total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits for the previous week of July 26 jumped by 38,000 to 1.97 million, the highest level since November of 2021.\n\nZelenskyy says Ukraine \u2014 and Europe \u2014 must have seats at the table\n\nA meeting between Putin and Trump on the war would be a departure from the Biden administration\u2019s policy of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d \u2014 a key demand from Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said he planned calls with European leaders Thursday to discuss the latest developments amid a flurry of diplomatic activity.\n\nEuropean countries must also be involved in finding a solution to the war on their own continent, he said on Telegram.\n\n\u201cUkraine is not afraid of meetings and expects the same bold approach from the Russian side. It is time to end the war,\u201d he added.\n\nVladimir Putin says he wants to meet directly with Trump next week\n\nThe Russian president said Thursday that the United Arab Emirates might serve them as a meeting site. He spoke on the eve of a White House deadline for Moscow to show progress toward ending the 3-year-old war in Ukraine.\n\nPutin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov had earlier brushed aside the possibility of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joining the summit, something the White House had said Trump was ready to consider. Putin has spurned Zelenskyy\u2019s previous offers of a meeting to clinch a breakthrough.\n\n\u201cWe propose, first of all, to focus on preparing a bilateral meeting with Trump, and we consider it most important that this meeting be successful and productive,\u201d Ushakov said, adding that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff\u2019s suggestion of a meeting including Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201cwas not specifically discussed.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction to Trump\u2019s tariffs has been scant. In early European trading, Germany\u2019s DAX rose 0.9% to 24,137.51. In Paris, the CAC 40 added 0.8% to 7,693.36, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shed 0.3% to 9,138.96.\n\nThe future for Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%, and S&P 500 edged 0.5% higher. In Asian trading, Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.7% to 41,059.15.\n\nMore than 60 countries and the European Union face tariff rates of 10% or higher\n\nProducts from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to place an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing the combined tariffs imposed by the United States on its ally to 50%, to go into effect later this month.\n\nTrump has used tariff threats to exert political pressure\n\nTrump has directly tied Brazil\u2019s 50% tariff on many imported goods to the trial of his embattled ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest. And the White House has placed the tariff rate on U.S. imports from Canada at 35%, saying Canada had failed to \u201cdo more to arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\u201d\n\nTrump says he will change the Census counts to exclude immigrants in the US illegally\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social that he has \u201cinstructed\u201d the Commerce Department to change the way the Census Bureau operates.\n\nThe president says it will be based on \u201cmodern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,\u201d an indication that he might try to inject his politics into survey work that measures everything from child poverty to business operations.\n\nTrump stressed that as part of the changes, people in \u201cour Country illegally\u201d will be excluded from Census counts.\n\nTariffs to affect more than half of Indian exports to the US\n\nAmerican consumers and businesses buy pharmaceutical drugs, precious stones, and textiles and apparel from India, among other goods. The U.S. ran a $45.8 billion trade deficit in goods with India last year, meaning America imported more from India than it exported, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nA top body of Indian exporters said Thursday the latest U.S. tariffs will impact nearly 55% of the country\u2019s outbound shipments to America and lead to exporters losing long-standing clients.\n\n\u201cAbsorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable. Margins are already thin,\u201d S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said in a statement.\n\nTrump move Trump to discuss vaccines Thursday, talks up Operation Warp Speed against COVID\n\nThe president was asked about his top health official, Robert Kennedy Jr., announcing plans to pull $500 million in vaccine development and said he plans a meeting to discuss vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna look at that. We\u2019re talking about it,\u201d Trump said of the funding cuts.\n\nHe also praised his first-term effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, Operation Warp Speed. He said that push was \u201cconsidered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country, but added, \u201cThat was now a long time ago. And we\u2019re on to other things.\u201d\n\nTrump said of Thursday\u2019s planned meeting: \u201cWe\u2019re looking for other answers to other problems, to other sicknesses and diseases.\u201d\n\nTrump says he plans to put a 100% tariff on computer chips\n\nThe president said Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on computer chips, likely raising the cost of electronics, autos, household appliances and other goods deemed essential for the digital age.\n\nTrump said companies that make computer chips in the U.S. would be spared the import tax.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to an uptick in overall inflation.",

We will keep your personal data for only as long as we need it, after which we will delete it.\nWe use a third party survey provider for running our surveys, and we keep your data in the third party platform for three months to enable us to analyse your responses, after which we aggregate your responses and delete your personal data so it can no longer identify you.\nWe may ask you to attend face-to-face Zoom interviews with us or a partner that we have commissioned on our behalf. However, participation is voluntary and you are free to decline the invitations at any time. We may also send you links to short surveys and your responses to these surveys will be anonymous. If you agree to be a part of the panel, we will re-contact you after a year to ask if you wish to continue to be a part of the panel and give you a chance to opt out.\nWe may use the feedback you provide in our surveys or as part of our user testing panel, as quotes on our website, or in internal and external presentations in connection with the research study and our publications. However where we do this we will ensure that the quote is anonymous \u2013 unless you give us your permission to use your name, photograph or screenshots of you during any Zoom interviews.\n3) Information we generate about you.\nWhen you register for an Independent account, take out a subscription for The Independent or sign up for one of our newsletters, we assign you a unique ID number. We use your unique ID to recognise you when you are logged in. We also use it to ensure we remember your preferences such as which newsletter you have signed up to.\nFor readers who have not registered or subscribed, and are browsing our site anonymously, we assign you a unique ID number based on your device which remembers your browsing behaviour. This ID cannot identify you unless you then register or subscribe, after which we will link your anonymous browsing behaviour to your ID. This is so we can offer you a more personalised and engaging experience when you register or subscribe.\nWe also assign you a unique ID number which remembers your browsing behaviour. This includes how long you spend on an article, what types of articles you read (e.g. travel, politics, sports and so on) and how many, as well as how often you visit our website or app. This is so we can personalise the site and our communications to you, and where you have consented to this, we also deliver tailored advertising that is more relevant to your interests.\nWe provide each reader with a cookie ID for analytics purposes, so we can recognise when you come back on to our site using one of your devices such as your laptop or mobile phone. We do this so we know how many individuals come back to our site.\n4) Data we receive about you from other organisations.\nSometimes we obtain additional information about you from data management and consumer insight providers, such as Eyeota.\nThe data these companies may hold about you is collected from publicly available records, such as the electoral roll, or from other sources where you have agreed for your information to be shared with third parties.\nWe may then match you with the data that they hold in their database to find out demographic or household information about you. This ensures that the advertising you see is relevant if you consent to this.\nSocial media\nWe can also access limited information from social media activity such as when you \u2018like\u2019 the website, share content or follow us on Twitter or Facebook. When you sign in to our website using Google, we collect your name and email address. If you sign up for one of our newsletters on Facebook, we receive your email address so we can send you the newsletter you\u2019ve asked for. We may also receive demographic information from social media sites such as Facebook, including aggregated information on age and gender. However this cannot be linked back to you individually. This is used to tailor the advertising we show you if you\u2019ve agreed to receive personalised advertising.\nWe use personal data collected through our sites and apps only when we have a valid reason and the legal grounds to do so. The legal grounds may be one of the following:\nConsent.\nIf you have given us consent to send you specific newsletters, you can unsubscribe from these at any time. You can do this by clicking \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 at the bottom of each email (and additionally at the top of emails if you use Yahoo or Gmail), or by logging into your account and managing your email preferences.\nWe only conduct market research and send you surveys if you have consented to this.\nWe will send you push notifications from our apps, and/or send you browser notifications when you are visiting our app or website, only where you have consented.\nWe will only process your data for marketing purposes to inform you about our products, services or promotional offers that you might find interesting where you have consented to this.\nUnless you have purchased one of our subscriptions, you will be required to provide your consent to us processing your personal data for targeted advertising in order to access our content. The remaining paragraphs of this section apply to such non-subscribers.\nWe may tailor advertising you see on our website based on the type of articles you read, so it is more relevant to your interests. We do this by allocating your ID to relevant interest groups or segments based on your reading behaviour. For example, if you have read three articles about travel or commented on a travel article in the last 30 days, or if you have visited a travel website prior to coming onto our website we may place your ID into the travel segment, and you will subsequently be shown more travel-related advertising. If your reading behaviour is similar to that shown for our travel audience, we may include your ID in our \u2018lookalike\u2019 travel segment for some campaigns.\nWe will never use any sensitive data (also known as special category data) for this purpose. Please read our Cookie Policy for more information about this.\nWe may personalise advertising to you based on the information that you provide us when you register for an account. For example, we may aggregate your age (based on year of birth that you provide us when you register) into groups e.g. 24-35 year olds, if an advertiser would like to target their ad campaigns to this demographic. As well as using your online browsing behaviour and your demographic information to personalise the advertising you receive, we may also use this aggregated information for reporting and analytics purposes. For example, to see how well a particular ad campaign has performed.\nWe occasionally work with advertising partners to securely match the email addresses of our registered reader database with their customer databases, using our data matching service provider. This is so we can show ads to readers we and our partners have in common. All data is encrypted before it is matched, and neither party can directly identify an individual, nor see or access the other party\u2019s data. The data match service provider does not have access to any raw, unencrypted data.\nGenerally, this will be conducted at an aggregate audience level to provide insights, rather than individual level information, although your information may be used to generate these insights. These insights might include the overlap between our audiences and the client\u2019s, and other information that would be useful to understand for an advertising campaign to be effective.\nFor readers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, if you click the \u201cDo not share/sell my personal information\u201d button, which is in the website footer at the bottom of the home page, we will not recontact you about that choice for at least 12 months.\nLegitimate interests.\nLegitimate Interests are ways in which we use personal data that you would reasonably expect. These include:\n- Sending you service messages about your subscription or account registration, for example if you have clicked a password reset link. This could be by email, overlay on the website or push notification (if you\u2019ve consented to receiving app push or web browser notifications).\n- Granting you access to a subscription.\n- Dealing with any query or complaint you submit to our Customer Services team. Only provide sensitive data when relevant (such as information about your health, race or religion) if you are happy to consent to our using it to manage your enquiry.\n- Dealing with, and responding to you about queries in the comment section and other user generated content facilities.\n- Logging and using information about any service errors or interruptions that you have experienced in order to help us create fixes and to make technical improvements to our website.\n- Security and fraud prevention.\n- Verifying your identity and remembering you (for example when you return to the website and have already logged in).\n- Enabling you to share our content with others using social media or email.\n- Administering competitions and informing you if you have been successful in any competitions or promotions.\n- Keeping you updated about our products and services, in line with your communication preferences.\n- Monitoring the number of Premium articles you read as a registered user on The Independent website. This is so we can request users subscribe once they have read the maximum number of Premium articles over a given period of time.\n- Monitoring the number of articles you read on The Independent app. This is so that we can request users subscribe once they have read the maximum number of articles on the app.\n- Analysing what articles you have read so we can improve our content and make recommendations to you.\n- Improving the design and style of the website.\n- Responding to your feedback on our products, services and website and app functionality\n- Ensuring that we are paid the correct amount of commission by our advertising partners if you buy a product or service from our website.\n- Allowing us to measure advertising campaigns, ensure readers do not see the same advertisements too many times, and ensure advertisements are served in appropriate environments for our clients.\nPerformance of a contract.\nWhen you buy a subscription or another product or service from us, we will need to use your details in order to provide the item to you. For example, in order to deliver a product to your home, you will need to give us your name and address.\nCompliance with our legal obligations.\nIn some cases, we may have a legal or regulatory obligation to use or keep your personal data.\nHow can you access and update your personal information?\nIf you are a registered user or subscriber, you can update your personal information by signing in to your account page.

Please note that any comments associated with your account will also be deleted.\nIf you do not read the newsletters that you have subscribed to, we will suppress your name from the relevant list after six months.\nIf you purchase a subscription, we will retain your data for at least 12 months after your subscription ends in case there are any outstanding billing or other customer service issues.\nA record of a customer service query is retained for at least three years from the date it was submitted to us.\nWe retain cookie data and corresponding third party data for 13 months from when it was collected from your device. For more information about cookies, please read our Cookie Policy.\nWe may need to retain your data for a longer period if there is a legal claim or if we are required to so by any regulation. We may also retain your personal information to ensure we do not contact you if you have asked us not to.\nWe are fully committed to keeping your personal information safe and we take measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, as you will appreciate, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed as 100% secure.\nWho do we share your personal information with?\nSharing with the Group\u2019s companies\nWe may disclose your personal information to our sister companies: Independent Digital News and Media LLC and Evening Standard Limited.\nAdvertising partners\nIf you consent to the use of advertising cookies on our website, advertisers and advertising agencies sometimes require data to select and serve relevant advertisements to you based on your onsite behaviour e.g. whether you\u2019ve clicked on an ad and are re-targeted with another ad from the same advertiser. We may also provide them with audience demographics about an audience who viewed or interacted with a campaign.\nFor more information on what personal data we collect and how we use it, please refer to the sections above \u2018What personal information do we collect about you?\u2019 and \u2018What do we use your personal information for?\u2019.\nGovernment or regulatory bodies only if required by law\nWe reserve the right to disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws and government or regulatory bodies\u2019 lawful requests for information.\nOur service providers\nYour personal details may be shared with third party organisations we have contracted to provide services to us which include processing data. For example, to send you the emails you have signed up for, to process your payment information when you buy a product or service, or for other purposes as described in this policy. Only companies who can provide adequate safeguards will be used to ensure your data is stored and handled securely. And we have contracts in place with these providers to make sure that they only use information in ways we have instructed them to, and to protect your data and comply with applicable law.\nTransfer as part of the sale of our business\nWe may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this Privacy Policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business.\nAgencies and authorities because of a legal requirement\nWe may also have to release information because of a legal requirement on us or pursuant to a court order.\nUsing children\u2019s personal information\nWe do not aim our services to children under the age of 13. We do not allow children under 18 to register an account with us.\nWill my data be sent overseas?\nAs you will know, the internet does not recognise national boundaries. Services on the web are accessible globally so collection and transmission of personal data is not always confined to one country.\nYou should be aware that by using the website and those of our partners or any website we link through to, your personal data may be processed in or transferred to other countries, the USA for example, and you agree to your personal data being transferred or processed in this way.\nYour personal data will only be stored or transferred within the UK, EEA, US or other countries using Standard Contractual Clauses, or other safeguards that have been approved by the relevant regulatory body.\nIf you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the UK or the EEA.\nHow we may contact you\nWe will contact you in accordance with your preferences. From time to time we may contact you by email or browser or app push notification to give you service information. For example, if your subscription is changing, or your payment method has expired. You will not be able to opt-out from receiving these service messages unless you no longer wish to use the services.\nIf we have your permission we may also send you newsletters or emails about our events, subscription benefits or new launches and website developments.\nYou can manage your preferences and subscriptions to newsletters and emails by signing into to your Independent account.
