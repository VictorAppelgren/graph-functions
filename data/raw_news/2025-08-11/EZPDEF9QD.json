  "title": "Gunman in CDC attack fired over 180 shots at building and broke 150 windows",
  "description": "Georgia man who blamed Covid vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal shot and killed a police officer",
  "content": "The man who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday fired more than 180 shots into the campus and broke about 150 windows, with bullets piercing \u201cblast-resistant\u201d windows and spattering glass shards into numerous rooms, according to information circulated internally at the agency.\n\nIt may take weeks or even months to replace windows and clean up the damage, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel said.\n\nA Georgia man who had blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal opened fire late on Friday, killing a police officer. No one at CDC was injured.\n\nThe shooter was stopped by CDC security guards before driving to a nearby pharmacy and opening fire late Friday afternoon, a law enforcement official has told the AP. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. The 30-year-old man, Patrick Joseph White, later died, but authorities haven\u2019t said whether he was killed by police or killed himself.\n\nThe US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, traveled to Atlanta and on Monday met with the agency\u2019s director, Susan Monarez.\n\nMonarez posted a statement on social media on Friday night that said at least four CDC buildings were hit in the attack.\n\nThe extent of the damage became more clear during a weekend CDC leadership meeting. Two CDC employees who were told about what was discussed at the meeting described details to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to reveal the information. Details also were also in an agency memo seen by an AP reporter.\n\nBuilding 21, which houses Monarez\u2019s office, was hit by the largest number of bullets. CDC officials did not say if her office was hit.\n\nCDC employees were advised to work from home this week.\n\nKennedy issued a statement on Saturday that said \u201cno one should face violence while working to protect the health of others,\u201d and that top federal health officials were \u201cactively supporting CDC staff\u201d.\n\nHe did not speak to the media during his visit on Monday.\n\nA retired CDC official, Stephan Monroe, said he worried about the long-term impact the attack would have on young scientists\u2019 willingness to go to work for the government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that this is going to be a generational hit,\u201d said Monroe, speaking to a reporter near the corner where a poster had been set up in honor of David Rose, the officer who was killed.\n\nKennedy was a leader in a national anti-vaccine movement before Donald Trump selected him to oversee federal health agencies, and has made false and misleading statements about the safety and effectiveness of about Covid-19 shots and other vaccines.\n\nYears of false rhetoric about vaccines and public health was bound to \u201ctake a toll on people\u2019s mental health\u201d, and \u201cleads to violence\u201d, said Tim Young, a CDC employee who retired in April.\n\nDr Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general during President Trump\u2019s first administration, said on Sunday that health leaders should appreciate the weight of their words.\n\n\u201cWe have to understand people are listening,\u201d Adams told Face the Nation on CBS. \u201cWhen you make claims that have been proven false time and time again about safety and efficacy of vaccines, that can cause unintended consequences.\u201d",

      "text": "A union representing US Centers for Disease Control employees has demanded that the federal government condemn vaccine misinformation after a man who evidently blamed the Covid-19 vaccination for making him depressed and suicidal aimed gunfire Friday at the CDC\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta.\nThe 30-year-old shooting suspect, who killed a police officer and died during the attack, had also tried to get into the CDC\u2019s headquarters \u2013 but he was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press on Saturday.\nThe CDC workers\u2019 union said the deadly violence on Friday was not random and \u201ccompounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured\u201d. It said vaccine misinformation had put scientists at risk.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, added that the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHH) \u2013 headed by Trump administration appointee and avowed vaccine safety skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 must provide a \u201cclear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation\u201d.\nSuch a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release.\n\u201cTheir leadership is critical in reinforcing public trust and ensuring that accurate, science-based information prevails,\u201d the union said.\nPatrick Joseph White was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, when he attacked, said an official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.\nWhite\u2019s gunfire hit at least four CDC buildings, the agency\u2019s director, Susan Monarez, said on X.\nDeKalb county police officer David Rose was mortally wounded while responding. Rose, 33, a former US marine who served in Afghanistan, had graduated from the police academy in March.\nWhite was found on the second floor of a building across the street from the CDC campus and died at the scene, Atlanta police chief Darin Schierbaum said. He added that \u201cwe do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted\u201d.\nThe Georgia bureau of investigations said the crime scene was \u201ccomplex\u201d. The agency added that the investigation into the violence would take \u201can extended period of time\u201d.\nFired But Fighting, a group of laid-off CDC employees, has said Kennedy Jr is directly responsible for the villainization of the CDC\u2019s workforce through \u201chis continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust\u201d.\nKennedy Jr reached out to staff on Saturday. The DHH secretary said \u201cno one should face violence while working to protect the health of others\u201d.\nDr Jerome Adams, who served as the US surgeon general during Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency, said Kennedy\u2019s response to Friday\u2019s shooting was \u201ctepid\u201d, late and amounted to a \u201cfailed \u2026 test\u201d of his leadership.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has actually contributed to a lot of what\u2019s been going on,\u201d Adams said on Sunday on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\nAdams said the mRNA-based vaccine technology that helped end the Covid-19 pandemic saved more than 2 million lives \u201cby the most conservative estimates\u201d. His comments came days after Kennedy moved to cancel $500m in mRNA vaccine research.\nThousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the attacked campus. The union said some staff were huddled in various buildings until late at night. More than 90 young children were locked down inside the CDC\u2019s Clifton school.\nThe union said CDC staff should not be required to immediately return to work after experiencing such a traumatic event. In its statement on Saturday, it said windows and buildings should first be fixed and made \u201ccompletely secure\u201d.\n\u201cStaff should not be required to work next to bullet holes,\u201d the union said. \u201cForcing a return under these conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of the horrific shooting they endured.\u201d\nThe union also called for \u201cperimeter security on all campuses\u201d until the investigation is fully completed and shared with staff.\nWhite\u2019s father contacted police and identified his son as the possible shooter. He said White had been upset over the death of his dog and also had become fixated on the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the law enforcement official who spoke to the AP anonymously.\nA neighbor of White told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White \u201cseemed like a good guy\u201d but spoke with her multiple times about distrusting Covid-19 vaccines in unrelated conversations.\n\u201cHe was very unsettled, and he very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people,\u201d Nancy Hoalst told the Atlanta newspaper. \u201cHe emphatically believed that.\u201d\nBut Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: \u201cI had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC.\u201d"
