  "title": "BenQ unveils a 32 inch 4K display with factory tuned color accuracy and integrated audio",
  "description": "PV3200U aimed squarely at content creators",
  "content": "\u2022 BenQ PV3200U is a 32-inch 4K monitor with calibrated color display for content creators\n\u2022 It has an integrated 2.1 audio system with woofer but headphones may still be required\n\nBenQ has taken the wraps off its new 32-inch 4K monitor designed primarily for video creators who want better audio than usually found in mid-range monitors.\n\nThe PV3200U\u2019s display combines a calibrated panel with an integrated 2.1 sound system. The monitor offers 95% DCI-P3 coverage along with full Rec.709 and sRGB, aiming to deliver consistent visuals across platforms.\n\nWith factory calibration at Delta E \u2264 2, BenQ says editors can expect color stability whether producing for Mac, Windows, or mobile playback.\n\nM-book Mode and ICCsync are included to match Mac devices more closely, which can help reduce unwanted shifts once projects move beyond the editing stage.\n\nWhile most monitors only include basic speakers, the PV3200U introduces a small 5W woofer alongside dual 2W speakers to produce a fuller sound. It\u2019s hard to say without hearing it in action, whether it will be good enough to replace headphones for detailed audio editing, so you may want to try before you buy.\n\nPV3200U has a useful Studio Mode designed to preserve audio detail by avoiding unnecessary processing, something BenQ says will provide users with an accurate reference point.\n\nTo reduce clutter and simplify setup across multiple devices, the monitor makes use of a single USB-C cable to carry 4K video, transfer data, and provide up to 65W charging.\n\nA wireless Hotkey Puck is included, giving users quicker access to adjustments during editing.\n\nThe ergonomic stand supports tilt, swivel, pivot, and height adjustments, which should be handy for different working styles.\n\n\u201cCreators shouldn\u2019t have to guess how their content will look and sound once it\u2019s live,\u201d said Peter Huang, President of BenQ Corporation.\n\n\u201cToo often, post-production color shifts and flat audio edits hamper YouTubers. PV3200U\u2019s precise color, clear sound editing, and seamless device compatibility empower creators to trust the creative process from first cut to final upload.\u201d\n\nBy combining color precision, integrated audio, and simplified connectivity, BenQ is positioning the PV3200U as an all-in-one editing solution for YouTubers and the like, but whether it can truly do away with the need for external gear is up for debate. Many creators will need convincing that a single screen can replace dedicated speakers and other hardware for critical work.\n\nThe PV3200U monitor is priced at \u00a3699 in the UK and available to buy from here. No word on global availability yet.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 These are the best 5K and 8K monitors that you can buy right now\n\u2022 And these are the best monitors for photo editing on any budget\n\u2022 LG has a new 5K monitor with a Thunderbolt 5 port, and I love that it is curved",

      "text": "The best 4K monitor in 2025: top Ultra HD displays for your PC\nThere was a time when the best 4K monitors were so expensive that only the five richest kings of Europe could afford them. Now, though, they\u2019re much more reasonably priced, meaning Ultra HD quality is more accessible than ever. Many of our top picks are in the same ballpark range as the best 1440p monitors, despite having higher resolutions.\nOur favorite 4K monitor is the Dell 4K S3221QS. At 31.5 inches across, its curved screen is expansive enough for the 4K resolution to shine without being such a behemoth that you get neck strain. You get a great balance of features and price, giving you a super-sharp screen for an outlay that won\u2019t break the bank. It looks gorgeous, too, so you won\u2019t mind looking at it while you work either.\nThe Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q is also worth some serious consideration. It\u2019s incredibly ergonomic, allowing you to tilt, swivel and pivot it to your heart\u2019s content, while its accurate colors and 28-inch screen size make it enjoyable in everyday usage. And with its low price tag, it\u2019s within reach of even the most budget-conscious 4K hunters.\nAnd then there\u2019s the BenQ PD2705UA. It\u2019s tailor-made for photographers, with its fantastic color accuracy and excellent connectivity options. Seeing and editing your photos on its 27-inch display is a great experience from start to finish.\nWe\u2019ve spent years rigorously putting hundreds of monitors through their paces, so we know a thing or two about display quality - our recommendations come from hands-on experience and our reviewers' own opinions. Have a read through our guide and you\u2019ll soon know exactly which of the best 4K monitors is right for you.\nThe best 4K monitors in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best 4K monitor picks on our list. We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best 4K monitor overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDell\u2019s 4K monitor is stunning inside and out. We love its woven arctic white design that lends to its unique elegant look, allowing it to stand out against the sea of black and gray monitors out there. Its display is impeccable as well.\nOn top of that 4K resolution is a contrast ratio of 3,000:1, support for 1.07 billion colors, up to 4ms response time, and a 178/178 viewing angle that altogether produce stunning, crisp and vibrant visuals that are just as excellent for media consumption as they are for productivity.\nThose who like to multitask will appreciate its extra features like Picture-in-Picture, Picture-by-Picture and USB 3.0 hub. The price of entry isn\u2019t bad either, and considering what you\u2019re getting, you\u2019re getting great value. You can get something like the BenQ EW3270U at a similar price, you do miss out on the curved screen and Dell\u2019s suite of multitasking features.\nRead the full Dell 4K S3221QS Curved Monitor review\nThe best budget 4K monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWith the Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q, you\u2019re getting a lot of value for your money \u2013 especially considering the small price of entry. One of the most affordable 4K gaming monitors right now, this 28-inch display can swivel, pivot and tilt practically whichever way you need (within reason, naturally) to serve your purpose. In fact, this is among the ergonomic monitors we've ever tested.\nOf course, it takes more than great ergonomics to be a great monitor. It also has deliciously thin bezels and a nifty cable management solution, as well as a few display settings to boost your viewing experience and Adaptive-Sync for a smoother gaming experience. Thanks to its rich vibrant colors, super sharp image quality and a design that is only subtly gaming-centric, this is among the best 4K monitors not only for gamers but for regular users who consume a lot of visual media as well.\nTo save money on Asus products, check out our Asus promo codes.\nRead the full Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q review\nThe best 4K monitor for photographers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BenQ PD2705UA might not be the ideal 4K display for competitive gaming, but it shines in just about every other respect. It has a gorgeous 27-inch display that\u2019s large enough to suit a variety of purposes while being small enough that it won\u2019t dominate the room.\nThis monitor is endlessly versatile, thanks in no small part to its integrated Ergo Arm. Clamping securely onto your desk, it allows the monitor to be pivoted, rotated, and angled to suit whatever you\u2019re working on. The angle of rotation extends to 275 degrees, giving you plenty of scope to reposition the screen to suit the task at hand.\nThis more modestly sized 4K display is ideal for professionals and creatives, including photographers. With 99% sRGB and Rec.709 color coverage, it lends itself very well to photo and video editing.\nIts 60Hz refresh rate might make it unsuitable for fast and responsive gaming, but chances are, if you\u2019re looking for a 4K panel for this purpose, you\u2019ll likely be looking at something with a bit more real estate anyway. What it offers instead is a wide range of adjustable color modes, and additional features including Picture-In-Picture and Picture-By-Picture, which make it ideal for multitasking and editing work.\nRead the full BenQ PD2705UA review\nThe best curved 4K gaming monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Gigabyte M32UC curved gaming monitor is the full package and is ideal especially for multiplatform gamers. Not only does it provide 4k gaming at 144 Hz but it provides respectable HDR400 along with just enough curvature for an immersive experience. There\u2019s also a good amount of ports and great color gamut coverage, though we had to tinker with the settings to get the colors to pop.\nIt also comes with most of the features one could need including a USB-C port \u2013 though it doesn\u2019t deliver enough power to charge a laptop \u2013 that HDMI 2.1 port that\u2019s critical for 4K gaming at 120Hz with next-gen consoles, and KVM for those who want to connect multiple sources.\nJust make sure to invest in a pair of external speakers. The ones that Gigabyte has included are worth avoiding.\nRead the full Gigabyte M32UC review\nThe best 4K monitor for professionals\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBenQ does a great job of making well-rounded monitors, and the BenQ PD2706UA is a terrific example of that. It's a fairly affordable choice, sitting square in the mid-range, comes with a fantastic display, and offers great features such as the ergonomic C-Clamp stand and KVM. And if you're working for a monitor that is work-versatile, it should be considered.\nBy work-versatile, we mean that it's perfect for productivity, especially with its PiP/PBP and USB-C with power delivery features, but it's also good for content creation and design work being pre-calibrated and offering great color accuracy and coverage. Having run it through a colorimeter, we were able to actually get 96% coverage for P3, 100% for sRGB, and 89% for Adobe RGB plus an average Delta E of 1.12.\nIt has two issues: there\u2019s no automatic input switching, and the speakers are pretty lackluster. But those are hardly deal-breakers, especially since you're already getting so much good stuff.\nRead our full BenQ PD2706UA Designer review\nThe best bendable 4K monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBendable monitors are a fresh breed, but they've already proven their worth and secured a place in the world. And, at least at this moment when there aren't a lot of options yet, the LG OLED Flex is the best there is, especially if you want to go big and go 4K.\nMoonlighting as a TV, this gaming monitor is great for productivity work as well, especially if you need the screen real estate for multitasking. We absolutely love the bending implementation here; it's beautifully and elegantly executed - not to mention, it add to your convenience, especially if you're switch game genres or from gaming to work. And while a 42-inch 4K display does require a bit of muscle, we enjoyed butter-smooth visuals during our time with, even when playing a fast-paced game.\nWe absolutely love all the extra features as well, including its Smart TV feature. If you don't have money to shell out for another TV, this can moonlight as one. This does take up a lot of space, however, and can really put a dent in your bank account. So only invest if you have deep pockets.\nRead our full LG OLED Flex review\nThe best 4K 144Hz gaming monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Corsair Xeneon 32UHD144 may be expensive. And, its HDR performance might be a little underwhelming, especially considering the price. But, this monitor is still a stellar option for most people. To start, you don\u2019t have to choose between fast refresh rates and crisp, detailed images with it as it provides 4K resolution at 144 Hz. That alone makes this monitor great for any gamer not too hung up on HDR.\nBut, creatives will find this to be solid for their use as well. We were impressed, for instance, by the 32UHD144\u2019s color gamut coverage. With its 100% Adobe and sRGB, it can handle anything photographers and graphic designers need it to. And, its 98% DCI-P3 coverage means that it does well for video editing as well. Additionally, it comes with iCue integration which we really appreciated as it let us properly set up the monitor through the app directly on our computer instead of having to dive deep into the monitor OSD menu.\nGet the best deals on Corsair products with our Corsair coupon codes.\nRead our full Corsair Xeneon 32UHD144 review\nThe best ergonomic 4K monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe LG 32UN880 UltraFine Display Ergo has done something cool. Instead of going for the same homogeneous mount and stand that all monitors have, it has opted for a C-Clamp, One-Click Mount that allows it to extend, retract, go high, go low, tilt and pivot like no other. Plus, as it clamps down on the edge of the desk, it reduces the monitor\u2019s footprint somewhat. That\u2019s versatility turned up to 11. In fact, we can safely say that this is the most ergonomic monitor we\u2019ve tested.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. It also boasts incredible color accuracy and beautiful picture quality. The best part is that you\u2019re getting all that without burning a massive hole in your pocket. Admittedly, the 350 nits of brightness and the HDR10 compatibility are a tad disappointing. However, for us, this is still an easy recommendation for creatives as well as gamers.\nRead the full LG 32UN880 UltraFine Display Ergo review\nFind the best deals on LG products with our LG coupon codes.\nThe best smart 4K monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWho says monitors have to be boring? The Samsung M8 takes the philosophy of more is better and packs it into an iMac-like package that make most monitors look like they were produced in a mortuary.\nOf course, there are some caveats as the M8 does feel a bit flimsy. And, when tested, we found its uneven backlighting and slightly underwhelming color gamut coverage to preclude it from gaming or creative work.\nBut, if you need a solid productivity monitor, it offers a whole lot of functionality including USB-C connectivity with 65 watts of power delivery, a clip-on adjustable magnetic webcam with a security cap, and smart TV functionality that will let you stream Netflix, Disney+ or whatever other streaming service you like when you\u2019re procrastinating from work. Of course, there are some built-in speakers as well though we recommend investing in some external ones instead.\nRead our full Samsung M8 review\nThe best 4K monitor: FAQs\nIs a 4K monitor worth it?\nThe best 4K monitors are going to give you incredible visuals that pair well with your gaming PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, and the most recent movies and shows filmed with UHD. If you watch a lot of media or play a lot of the newest games, you should definitely consider getting the best 4K monitor so you can play and watch everything as it\u2019s meant to be seen in high-definition.\nIf you\u2019re not a frequent gamer and are just looking to get a new monitor, it might still be a good idea to upgrade to a 4K monitor. It seems high-definition is where the standard resolution is headed, so it might be best to be ahead of the curve with a 4K display. Even if you only watch the occasional YouTube video when working, a 4K monitor will definitely make a difference.\nIs 4K good for office work?\nOne of the biggest advantages of 4K resolution is having more screen real estate, which means you'll have a lot more space to work with. That makes it great for multitasking \u2013 the more space you have, the more tabs, windows and applications you can open and make immediately accessible.\n4K monitors are not necessary for office work. However, you might find it extremely advantageous to use one, especially if you tend to juggle different tasks at the same time.\nWhat is the best monitor size for 4K?\nMany say that 4K is great on 24-, 27-, and 32-inch panels while others love it on 43-inch ones. Of course, it all depends on how far you are from your display and how big your desk is.\nJust bear in mind that on a 24-inch panel, that 4K resolution will make everything smaller, which in turn makes text harder to read. Display scaling helps improve your experience, but not all apps can be scaled to the ideal size.\nMeanwhile, having a massive 43-inch screen is overkill for most people, especially if you're using your computer mostly for productivity tasks. It also requires a lot of desk space.\nThis is why most people think that a 32-inch panel is the sweet spot for 4K resolution. It's the ideal size for enjoying that incredibly sharp and detailed Ultra HD goodness.\nMany say that 4K is great on 24-, 27-, and 32-inch panels while others love it on 43-inch ones.

It's the ideal size for enjoying that incredibly sharp and detailed Ultra HD goodness.\nHow to choose the best 4K monitor for you\nKnowing what to look for in the best 4K monitor is important when choosing the right one for you. You need to know what panel size is ideal for your setup \u2013 bear in mind that the best monitor size for 4K is 32-inch \u2013 and the panel type (VA, IPS or TN) that's ideal for your needs, as well as the type of connectivity you require.\nOf course, if you plan on using yours for creative workflows, you should consider one with excellent color accuracy, the right color spaces for your work, higher brightness levels and a higher contrast ratio. If you plan on using it for gaming, you'll want to take a closer look at the refresh rate \u2013 some 4K monitors now offer 120Hz and 144Hz refresh rates, response time, and G-Sync or FreeSync support.\nOther important things to consider are the aspect ratio, viewing angles and HDR capabilities.\nFinally, take a look at the price. Many 4K displays are still pretty expensive, but there are also several excellent options out there that are affordable for most people. If you can afford to splurge, however, the kitted-out models are more than worth their steep price.\nHow we test 4K monitors\nWe test a 4K monitor like we test any other monitor. We start by setting it up and using it as our main monitor for a few days. We utilize it for our day-to-day workloads, streaming movies and shows, and, especially if it's a gaming monitor, playing our favorite AAA games. This is how we gauge its real-world performance.\nWe do more than that, however. We also test very specific features like color reproduction, refresh rates and response times. We make sure that the visuals are smooth, clean, and artifact-free. And, we check just how good its marquee features \u2013 HDR, adaptive sync technology, RGB lighting \u2013 are.\nWe then note its design, build and other physical features like bezels, ports and viewing angles.\nFinally, we gather all that information and compare it to its price to see if it\u2019s a great value to consumers overall.\nToday's best 4K monitor deals\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRob (He/Him) is a UK based tech writer with a BA Hons Degree in English Studies with Media Communications and a Diploma in Proofreading and Copy Editing.\nSince becoming a freelance writer in 2022, Rob has built up a considerable portfolio of work, covering everything including buyer\u2019s guides, hardware reviews, features, and game reviews.\nIn addition to his contributions at TechRadar, Rob\u2019s work has also been featured at MakeUseOf.com, How-To Geek, and IGN.\nCurrently playing: Dredge, Lords of the Fallen.\n- Michelle Rae UyContributor\n- John LoefflerComponents Editor"

In our tests, we found the 6K picture quality stunning, the port selection excellent, and the camera to be crisp.\nBest on a budget\nThe Asus ProArt PA279CRV proves professional photo editing monitors don\u2019t need to cost the earth. A 27in 4K display, the screen offers excellent color coverage and plenty of pop thanks to 400 nits of brightness.\nBest 4K\nThe BenQ PD3205U is an excellent monitor with a very strong focus on productivity and color accuracy. It has a great port offering, a programmable hotkey hockey puck dial, and a built-in KVM switch to help switch between multiple devices.\nBest for Mac\nOffering seamless integration with macOS, it matches the MacBook color profile almost perfectly, and is as close as I have seen to a first-party Apple display without actually being a first-party Apple Display, with features not even the Studio Display has.\nBest for business\nThe Dell UltraSharp U2723QE is a 27-inch 4K monitor with a focus on color accuracy and connectivity. It features a wide range of color presets (sRGB, Rec. 709, DCI-P3), making it perfect for photo editing, while the built-in connectivity hub and KVM switch add productivity benefits.\nBest portable\nIf you\u2019re working across multiple locations, the espressoDisplay portable monitor is the ideal solution. It\u2019s thin, lightweight, and robust enough to carry with you day-to-day. An impressively versatile display for photo editors.\nBest monitor for photo editing overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWith its impressive 6K resolution and sRGB 100% color coverage, the Dell UltraSharp U3224KBis arguably the best photo editing monitor for pretty much everyone.\nBeautifully designed, the display features a Thunderbolt hub, 4K webcam, and a soundbar, all built into one clean package. The only other monitor we've tested that comes close with this combination is the Apple Studio Display; in terms of image quality and size, the Dell U3224KB is more like the Apple Pro Display XDR. Both are excellent choices for photographers and creatives - but here, you're getting the best of both worlds in a single 32-inch screen (and it's cheaper with better connectivity, too)\nThat sRGB color space, though broad, may be a deal-breaker for some professional users who prefer Adobe RGB, and the 16:9 ratio has fallen out of favor in recent years. But for most these specs will be absolutely great. And with the stunning picture quality, extra-high resolution. it's got every other base covered, whatever photos you're working on.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp U3224KB 6K monitor review\nBest budget photo editing monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere aren't many budget photo editing monitors that boast 99% Adobe RGB and 99% DCI-P3, but the Asus ProArt PA279CRV is one of them.\nThis affordable screen delivers a near-pro level experience without breaking the bank. Better still, it looks great straight out of the box, before you even dive into the monitor's extensive calibration settings.\nThe 27-inch IPS panel features full 4K resolution for crisper images, excellent color space coverage, and a decent 400nits luminance. We really liked the features and connectivity with this screen, too, which includes includes USB-C connectivity. With its 96W power delivery and display daisy chaining, this makes for a very versatile display.\nHowever, it is a budget screen, so there are some compromises here. We did find the contrast to be relatively weak at 1,000:1, and the ProArt PA279CRV only has basic DisplayHDR 400 certification. But when it comes to picture quality, color accuracy, and plentiful connectivity, it's difficult to beat the value for money here.\nTo bring the price down even further, use one of our Asus coupon codes.\nRead our full Asus ProArt PA279CRV review\nBest 4K monitor for photo editing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BenQ PD3205U Monitor is an excellent choice for creatives who want a 4K panel that is perfect for photo and video editing thanks to its high color accuracy and great sRGB coverage. The integrated KVM Switch allows users to connect multiple computers and easily switch between them, all while moving any connected USB Devices with you from device to device (such as a mouse and keyboard). BenQ is notorious for not only great monitors but also their famous hockey puck control dial. This dial, by default, is helpful, but if customized, this becomes super-powered and helps with switching between color profiles, volume, KVM switching between devices, brightness levels, or any number of other settings.\nFurther, for those who rely on the accuracy of their digital product for their work, the BenQ PD3220U is a great choice because of its 99% sRGB and Rec. 709 color spaces. Though it does have a fairly dim display overall, so if you are working in a rather bright workspace, by a window with sunlight coming in and hitting the display, or something like that, you may want to consider all of that before grabbing a monitor with only 250 nits of brightness. But, if you don\u2019t mind that, this monitor is a great balance of features and price for those needing a reliable workhorse of a display.\nRead our full BenQ PD3205U review\nBest photo editing monitor for Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BenQ MA320U display has to be one of my favorite displays I have tested with my MacBook Pro. It\u2019s like an extension of my MacBook rather than something you have to add to my MacBook. The integration with DisplayPilot 2 makes it so I can control volume, brightness, and more all natively through my MacBook, without needing to go through any OSD, making this monitor feel like a native Apple Display. The color accuracy is nearly identical to the MacBook, making it a perfect reference monitor. Further, there is a native KVM switch, and, unlike the first-party Apple displays, the BenQ MA320U has not one, but two HDMI ports too, allowing for much greater usability for those trying to have a hybrid setup or for those who may want a great display but don\u2019t have a USB-C MacBook (or MacBook at all).\nOne downside is that this monitor does not have Thunderbolt 4, which means it may not be the most future-proof of all-in-one displays and docks, but it does have a beautiful display and port offerings, along with a sleek design, so it may be worth throwing on a Thunderbolt dock between your MacBook and this monitor if you need those extra ports and transfer speeds.\nRead our full BenQ MA320U review\nBest photo editing monitor for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nA wide range of color spaces - 100% Rec 709, 100% sRGB, 98% DCI-P3 - mark the 27-inch Dell U2723QE as one of the best monitors for photo editing if you want an all-in-one work hub.\nThis 4K UHD 3840 x 2160 LED screen offers true-to-life color, and while not the brightest monitor, we found the 2000:1 contrast ratio and HDR features helped to create a well-balanced, beautiful image with accurate colors when editing your photos. Those color space presets do more than just look great. They're excellent for increasing productivity. The ability to choose different presets meant we could switch from office apps to photo editing workflows quickly and easily.\nFor those spending long hours in front of the screen, we also found Low Blue Light emissions let us use the monitor without eye fatigue, even when we were parked in front of it for hours.\nOn the connectivity side, the U2723QE provides USB-C or DisplayPort ports for daisy-chaining monitors. You can also set up KVM, Picture-In-Picture, and Picture-By-Picture if you need to see or control multiple computers simultaneously. It may all be more than you need, and it doesn't come cheap, but as an all-in-one hub for any serious workspace, it excels.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp U2723QE review\nBest portable photo editing monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're working across locations, a portable monitor is a smart choice. Lightweight, easily carried, but with the same high resolutions and color coverage you'll need photo editing on the go. We've tested loads of compact models, but the espressoDisplay really stands out for us.\nDesign-wise, it's slim, sleek, simple - a single cable and a screen about the size of an iPad. We immediately felt the high build quality when in our hands - it feels durable, built for taking with you when you're roaming the streets, taking the commute.\nThe display supports 100% sRGB color space - that may or may not be a deal-breaker, but as a portable or second monitor away from your home workspace, this should be more than enough. The highly responsive touch FHD display makes it ideal for anyone drawing or photo editing with a stylus. You'll need pay extra for the espressoPen, but with excellent pressure and sensitivity, we can say it did provide a fair approximation of drawing on paper, considering the glass screen.\nIn fact, our only issue is the need to buy accessories - and there are plenty of them, not just the stylus - separately. After testing it for weeks, we were left beyond impressed, even awarding it a TechRadar Recommends badge in our review.\nRead our full espressoDisplay portable monitor review\nThe best photo editing monitors compared\nModel | Size | Resolution | Color | Brightness (nits) | Contrast |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nDell UltraSharp U3224KB | 32in | 6144 x 3456 | 100% sRGB | 750 | 2000:1 |\nAsus ProArt PA279CRV | 27in | 3840 x 2160 | 99% Adobe RGB, 99% DCI-P3 | 400 | 1000:1 |\nBenQ PD3205U | 31.5in | 3840 x 2160 | 99% sRGB/Rec | 250 | 1000:1 |\nBenQ MA320U | 32in | 3840 x 2160 | 99% sRGB, 97% DCI-P3 | 600 | 1300:1 |\nDell UltraSharp U2723QE | 27in | 3840 x 2160 | 100% Rec 709, 100% sRGB, 98% DCI-P3 | 400 | 2000:1 |\nespressoDisplay | 13.3 / 15.6in | 1920 x 1080 | 100% sRGB | 300 | 1000:1 |\nBest photo editing monitors: FAQs\nWhat are the minimum monitor specs for photo editing?\nWondering what the best specs for a photo editing monitor are? Here's what we look for when testing our displays and what we recommend looking for.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Minimum | Best |\nScreen size | 24-inch | 27-inch and above |\nColor space | 100% sRGB | 100% Adobe RGB / DCI-P3 |\nPanel | IPS | IPS / OLED |\nBit depth | 8-bit | 10-bit |\nPixels per inch (PPI) | 150 | 300 |\nColor accuracy | Delta E 2 | Delta E 1 |\nScreen resolution | 1080p | 4K and above |\nAspect ratio | 16:9 | 16:9 / 16:10 |\nLuminance | 300nits | 400nits and above |\nWhy do I need the best monitor for photo editing?\nIf you're photo editing or using them for photography, the best monitors capture a level of detail that can sometimes be missing in standard monitors designed for general use. Monitors for photographers and other content creators deliver greater clarity thanks to pin-sharp resolutions and picture-perfect color accuracy. So, even if your clients can't see on their standard monitors, if the image is used elsewhere - from display ads to printed assets - you can be confident that they look precisely as intended.\nDo I need a 4K monitor for photo editing?\nYou don't necessarily need the best 4K monitor for basic photo editing, but if you're a professional photographer or creative, it's the ideal resolution. A 4K photo editing monitor offers a lot more clarity over standard 1080p monitors. This gives you even more control over the finer details of each image you edit, producing outstanding results.\nFor photo editing, the best 5K and 8K monitors are even better, with even more details displayed. However, they've yet to go truly mainstream, so even if you edit images on an 8K monitor, others may not appreciate your work (until they get a similarly specced screen, at least). Opt for 4K if it's within budget.\nShould I choose sRGB or DCI-P3 or Adobe RGB?\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a graphic design or photo editing monitor, you may have come across sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color spaces. These are important, as it tells you how much of the spectrum is represented on the screen - and ideally, you\u2019ll want what you see while working to be as accurate to the finished product as possible. Effectively, it\u2019ll look the same on your screen as it does when, say, that asset is exported or sent to print.\nsRGB is the most common color space and is ideal for most photo editing, especially online or digital work.\nAdobe RGB covers 35% more of the color space than sRGB, displays better blues, and is great for printed assets.\nDCI-P3 is similar to Adobe RGB, displays better blues, primarily designed for video editing, and it's Apple's preferred color space.\nWhat's the difference between OLED and QLED?\nWhen scouting for a new monitor to complement your software, you're likely to come across OLED and QLED displays. But which one should you choose for editing photos?\nOLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screens are best for picture quality. Contrasts are better, with deeper blacks, better contrast, and better viewing angles, while consuming less power. QLED (Quantum Light-Emitting Diode) displays are best when you're working to a budget. These screens are typically brighter, with good color display, but they lack authenticity when it comes to displaying, say, deep blacks on screen.\nExplore the topic in our guide OLED vs QLED: Which TV tech is the best?\nShould I choose a curved monitor for photo editing?\nTechRadar Pro spoke to Brett Barbour, VP at US monitor vendor, Viotek, to find out whether it makes business sense to opt for a non-flat monitor for photo editing. Here's what he told us:\nWhen you think of the types of people that use \u2013 and love \u2013 the best curved monitors, three types of people come mind: gamers, gamers and gamers. But why should gamers have all the fun? Curved monitors could bring a fair bit of ergonomic benefit for office workers too. After all, our eyes have a nice curve to them. We might as well have a monitor that comes with a nice curve to match, right? Especially if we\u2019re expected to use them at least 6-8 hours a day. Ergonomics isn\u2019t the only benefits to curved monitors for the office.\nMost of us are spending a lot of time staring at a screen, be it for work or for play. And this brings additional health risks for our eyes. Headaches. Eye strain. Eye fatigue. But research has shown that curved panels yield less eye strain and fatigue than flat panels. So they\u2019re easier on the eyes \u2013 especially helpful if you spend most of your day in front of a monitor (or expect your employees to).\nThis benefit can also be further leveraged by software integrated into the monitor. For example, ASUS has their Eye Care technology; Viotek has their \u201cViotek Protect\u201d; and Samsung features a proprietary \u201cEye Saver Mode.\u201d These all provide a range of eye-saving benefits, including reducing the amount of harmful blue light radiation from hitting your eyes \u2013 particularly helpful when you\u2019re looking at the screen for extended all day.\nYou can expect less glare and distortion with a curved monitor. Its corners are closer to you, replicating the natural curvature of the human eye. In most workspace setups, the curved monitor won\u2019t reflect light at all, effectively reducing glare from other sources of light. The only exception being if a window is directly behind you at a certain angle. This is a rarity, but it can certainly happen.\nBut that's not all; normally, how nice a monitor looks is purely a question of personal preference. You like what you like \u2013 simple as. But the reality is that a curved monitor might take up less desk real estate than its flat counterpart. It might be nominal depending on the stand that it uses, but the curved ends will definitely give you some extra space to place odds and ends on your desk, from phone charging pads, pen holder or what have you.\nHowever, it is worth looking at the potential issues they might come from. In most cases, a curved monitor still costs a bit more than its flat-screen counterpart. An LG 34WK650-W is a 34-inch flat-screen IPS monitor with 2560x1080p resolution that goes for about $396.99. Or you could grab an LG 34GL750-B 34-inch curved monitor with the same resolution and faster refresh rate for around $449.99.\nThe difference might be as little as $50-75 per monitor. Still, if you\u2019re trying to fill up an entire office, that can add up.\nBut Is It Really a Con? Well, for now, maybe. But the cost gap is closing quickly, as manufacturing costs are dropping fast and certain brands (Samsung, ASUS, Viotek, et al.) find ways to pack a lot of features in quality monitors without sending the price through the roof.\nThere's also talks about the fact that curved monitors could hinder straight-line perception. This is another possibly niche drawback with curved monitors. It certainly won\u2019t apply to every office. Professionals in engineering, drafting or drawing industries may find that their straight-line perception is slightly skewed because of the curvature of a monitor. There is software that can \u201cfix\u201d this issue, but if you\u2019re in one of these industries, you may be better off sticking with a flat screen monitor for now.\nBrett Barbour is vice president of US monitor vendor Viotek.\nHow to choose the best photo editing monitor for you\nDisplay quality is absolutely critical when choosing which photo editing monitor is best. Whether you're running the best graphic design software or the best photo editors out there, you can use virtually any screen for editing photos. However, the quality will vary, and images will likely display very differently on different devices.\nColor accuracy & color coverage\nColor accuracy is a good starting point. IPS panels have the best color accuracy, though there is significant variation from one monitor model to the next. You'll find that some of the best business monitors are similarly-specced for photo editing. Many professionals with very specific digital or print workflows will know exactly what they need in terms of gamut coverage. But if you're not sure what you need, look for at least 95% coverage of either the DCI-P3 or Adobe RGB gamuts in the specs. That isn't professional grade color coverage. But it can be achieved quite cheaply these days and it's a good starting point for photo editing for web and other entry level or semi pro workflows. True 8-bit color coverage without dithering is another good minimum requirement, though again professional grade displays will be 10-bit.\nScreen resolution\nResolution is the next major spec point. More pixels allow you to view images in greater detail and closer to their true resolution. These days, there's little need to settle for less than 4K given entry-level 4K displays are now truly affordable. Just remember that you lose pixel density as screen sizes increase if the resolution remains the same. A 4K 40-inch monitor sounds great, but it doesn't actually have the pixel density required to render really sharp images. You also have the option of larger format ultrawide panels, including 5K2K monitors, which allow for more space while multi-tasking at the same time as displaying plenty of detail for image editing.\nHDR\nYou may or may not require HDR support, but be aware that few monitors that claim HDR capabilities are truly HDR monitors. If you want full HDR fidelity, it's very, very expensive. If in doubt, don't worry about HDR support, it's probably not required and you almost certainly don't want to spend the money to achieve actual HDR display performance.\nConnectivity\nOn the connectivity side, we recommend displays with USB-C sockets supporting power delivery of at least 65W, especially if you use a laptop or MacBook. USB-C used to add significantly to the price of a monitor. But more recently, 4K displays with USB-C connectivity have become much more reasonably priced.\nHow we test the best monitor for photo editing\n\u2705 15 years of product testing\n\u2705 Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2705 Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe've tested hundreds of displays for creatives including the best portable monitors, best monitors for MacBook Pro and the best monitors for the Mac mini.\nWhen testing which monitor for photo editing is best, we begin by looking at screen size and resolution. Screen size is measured diagonally in inches, while resolution measures the number of pixels that make up the display. But a bigger monitor doesn't necessarily mean greater resolution; the 24-inch Eizo has a higher resolution than the 27-inch NEC, for example.\nInstead, a more useful measure of the 'crispness' of a display is pixel density, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). The NEC is 82ppi, the Eizo 94ppi, while Samsung and Dell weigh in at 109ppi.\nMonitors increasingly offer more than just a simple display for your computer, and we've also looked at additional features including built-in speakers, USB hubs, card readers and multiple inputs, such as HDMI, for use with a variety of devices.\nWhile true-to-life colour reproduction is very important in image editing, you may need to compromise to get all the features you want within budget. LED backlighting allows thinner displays, while IPS (or Samsung's PLS) allows for greater viewing angles.\nWe'd always recommend using a digital interface like DVI or HDMI, but it depends on what your computer has. Do you want to plug in multiple devices? Make sure your new monitor has the same input as your computer has output!\nSeveral of these displays enable you to swivel the monitor from side to side and turn the screen 90 degrees into portrait mode.\nMost monitors are now capable of Full HD resolution (1920x1080) but more and more can achieve higher resolutions - many here are capable of 2560x1440, for example.\nWith so many devices plugged into our computers these days, a USB hub really is something you'll wonder how you lived without.\nSo many monitors - including several of these - are just plain ugly.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nIt's been a long time coming, but OLED panel technology is now entering the professional monitor market. Asus's first 32-inch 4K model is extremely impressive, but there are limitations to this mostly stunning display tech.\nPros\n- +\nPerfect per-pixel lighting control\n- +\nSizzling HDR highs\n- +\nStrong feature set\nCons\n- -\nOLED panel has limitations\n- -\nSlightly mediocre factory calibration\n- -\nNo DisplayPort input\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nIf patience is a virtue, the reward for digital creatives is the arrival of the first relatively affordable monitors based on OLED technology. Enter the new 32-inch 4K Asus ProArt PA32UCDM.\nAt $1,899 or \u00a31,599, this is far from a cheap display. But it's still much more affordable than, say, Apple's Pro Display XDR, which starts at $4,999 without a stand and makes do with inferior\u2014by some measures, at least\u2014LCD panel tech.\nIn some ways, that's not surprising. The Asus ProArt PA32UCDM uses the same 32-inch 4K QD-OLED panel sourced from Samsung that first appeared in gaming monitors over a year ago, including Asus's own Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM. Those monitors can now be bought for under $800.\nWhat they don't offer, of course, is the full suite of professional-friendly features. And that's exactly what the Asus ProArt PA32UCDM delivers, features like a comprehensive list of colour space presets, Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, hardware calibration, 10-bit colour and more.\nAsus ProArt PA32UCDM: Design & features\n- Slick, minimalist styling\n- Mostly strong feature set\n- Connectivity isn't comprehensive\nPanel size: 32-inch\nPanel type: QD-OLED\nResolution: 3,840 by 2,160\nBrightness: 250 nits full-screen, 1,000 nits peak HDR\nContrast: 1,200:1\nPixel response: 0.1ms GtG\nRefresh rate: 240Hz\nColour coverage: 99% DCI-P3\nHDR: VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack400\nVesa: 100mm x 100mm (bracket included)\nInputs: HDMI 2.1 x1, 1x Thunderbolt 4 with 90W PD, 1x Thunderbolt 4\nOther: USB hub with 1x USB-A and 1x USB-C\nSuch is the capability of the latest QD-OLED gaming monitors, it's tempting to snag one for productivity work. One reason you might not is garish design. Gaming panels tend to have a slightly adolescent whiff. So, the slick, minimalist and professional aesthetic of the Asus ProArt PA32UCDM is an immediate win.\nSome aspects of the design are reminiscent of Apple displays, including the hinge on rear, the sliding support and the neutral colour scheme. Speaking of Apple, while build quality is decent by most standards, the mix of metal and plastic definitely isn't as pleasing as the Apple Studio Display, let alone the much more expensive Apple Pro Display XDR.\nFor the record, this monitor offers height, tilt and rotation into portrait mode in terms of physical adjustment, but lacks swivel, which is a small pity. Elsewhere, the connectivity on offer is a bit of a mixed bag. On the upside, you get dual Thunderbolt 4 ports with support for display daisy chaining and 96W of power delivery, plus an HDMI 2.1 port with the full 48Gbps bandwidth.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nHowever, the USB hub only offers a single USB-A and USB-C port, and Asus has fitted this display with neither a DisplayPort input nor a headphone jack. The former is arguably catered for courtesy of DisplayPort Alt Mode over the Thunderbolt interface. But for some setups, an actual DisplayPort socket would be handy. Likewise the absent headphone output.\nAlong with the broader display capabilities and specs, you get 10-bit per channel colour, Dolby Vision support, hardware calibration and a full suite of OLED panel protection features including a proximity sensor for automatically dimming the display when not in use. In the comprehensive OSD menu you can choose between four, eight and 12-hour panel refresh cycles.\nAsus ProArt PA32UCDM: Performance\n- Stunning HDR highs\n- Limited full-screen brightness\n- Needs calibration for demanding workflows\nOn paper, this display has so much going for it. It starts with the basic proposition of 4K resolution on a 32-inch display, which is obviously ideal for many pro workflows, provides plenty of working space and bodes well for aspects like font rendering.\nTo that you can add the various upsides of OLED technology, which is only now beginning to enter the pro display market. Notably, that includes perfect per-pixel lighting the likes of which no LCD monitor can replicate, ditto the exceptional pixel speed and near-perfect viewing angles. Oh and outstanding colour extension, particularly from Samsung's OLED tech, which benefits from colour-enhancing quantum dot technology, hence the \"QD-OLED\" moniker.\nCombine that with the aforementioned 4K image detail and precision and, well, what a recipe. For the most part, what an experience, too. At its best, this is an exceptional display. Bright highlights in HDR video content, for instance, absolutely zing. The colour vibrancy is fantastic, too, and a clear step above LG's WOLED panels, which are the main alternative to Samsung QD-OLED. All of this is heightened by the glossy panel coating, which really lets the OLED technology sing.\nThis is not, however, a perfect display. For starters, It suffers the same limitations as all OLED panels, primarily limited brightness when large sections of the panel are being lit up. Asus provides a uniform brightness mode for SDR content. That allows for a maximum of 250 nits. For many uses and applications, that's enough.\nHowever, it's a little less than you might want in bright ambient conditions. However, where the limited brightness performance is really apparent is with HDR content. The claimed peak 1,000 nit HDR capability is only available across 3% of the panel. Light up 10% of the panel and the brightness dips to 400 nits.\nThe consequence is that this monitor, like all existing OLEDs, can look utterly stellar when displaying a mostly dark image with small, super-bright highlights. But it can lack a little pop when rendering brighter scenes. Moreover, if you run the screen in HDR mode on the Windows or Mac desktop, there's significant brightness variation, when, for instance, you resize a mainly white application window.\nFor the record, the image detail and font rendering isn't as good as displays with greater pixel density, such as various 27-inch 5K2K panels and Apple's 6K Pro Display XDR. What's more, Asus's factory calibration does leave a tiny bit to be desired. It's a little over saturated out of the box and also very slightly crushes some shadow details.\nOf course, if your workflows require the ultimate in accuracy, you'll be calibrating this monitor in any case and that eventuality is well catered for courtesy of a hardware 3D LUT, Asus's own ProArt calibration and support for third party calibration tools including CalMAN Autocal.\nIt's also worth noting that this is a very, very fast display. It supports 240Hz refresh and offers a claimed 0.1ms response. This isn't a monitor aimed at gaming, but it's pretty much as good as gaming-centric monitors based on the same panel.\nFinally, the Asus ProArt PA32UCDM does have a cooling fan that runs in max brightness HDR mode. But it's barely audible.\nAsus ProArt PA32UCDM: Final verdict\nThe transition of OLED into monitors aimed at digital creatives and other pros has taken a little longer than expected. But it's now happening and this Asus display is an excellent showcase of what the technology brings.\nThanks to the perfect per-pixel lighting, at its best the HDR performance totally blows away any LCD-based monitor, even one with mini-LED full-array dimming. The colours are explosive, in a good way, the viewing angles pretty much perfect. Combine that with the 4K pixel grid and features like Thunderbolt 4 with daisy chaining support you have a very compelling display for creative tasks.\nThe brightness limitations of current OLED tech, however, mean that this isn't a cheap alternative for authoring pro-grade HDR content. Like all other OLEDs, it simply can't sustain sufficient brightness across enough of the panel. Slightly patchy factory calibration is another weakness, though only slight and mitigated by excellent calibration support.\nAll told, this is a very welcome addition to the pro monitor market. It's not perfect, but it does bring some genuinely new abilities to the class. Mini-LED monitors still rule for full-screen brightness. And for now, there aren't very many format and resolution options available with OLED panels in the pro market. But this is almost certainly just the beginning for OLED technology aimed at creative pros.\nFor more displays for creative professionals, we've rounded up the best monitors for photo editing, the best monitors for graphic design, and the best monitors for video editing.\nTechnology and cars. Increasingly the twain shall meet. Which is handy, because Jeremy (Twitter) is addicted to both. Long-time tech journalist, former editor of iCar magazine and incumbent car guru for T3 magazine, Jeremy reckons in-car technology is about to go thermonuclear. No, not exploding cars. That would be silly. And dangerous. But rather an explosive period of unprecedented innovation.

      "text": "Best 5K and 8K monitor of 2025: We put these high-resolution displays to the test\nLooking for ultra-high resolutions and ultra-sharp picture quality? We reviewed the top 5K monitors and 8K monitors for professionals\nThe best 5K and 8K monitors are essential for pro designers, developers, and even gamers who demand ultra-high resolutions and ultra-sharp picture quality.\nBased on our comprehensive reviews, the Dell UltraSharp U4924DW stands out as the top pick for most people, and while it's not 'true 5K' (the resolution is 5120 x 1440, rather than 5120 x 2880), it's an excellent display that delivered exceptional image quality in our tests.\nFor one that hits max 5K resolution, check out the BenQ PD2730S, an impressive screen for creative professionals that we loved and seriously rivals the popular Apple Studio Display. While there aren't many around, for the best 8K monitor, the Dell UltraSharp UP3218K is a superb choice for those that need it.\nMy team and I have tested all the best business monitors, including the high-resolution displays in this round-up. For each model, we explore screen size, pixel count, connectivity, and overall performance for work and play.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nBest 5K monitor overall\nOur pro pick is the Dell UltraSharp U4924DW, which boasts a massive 49in display with 5120 x 1440 resolution.\nBest on a budget\nBest 5K monitor on a budget\nA stunning screen with a crisp, vibrant 5K resolution the Philips 499P9H is a 49in curved monitor that's older and slightly cheaper.\nBest 8K\nBest 8K monitor\nWe found the 8K resolution on this display to be simply jaw-dropping - incredible clarity from this 32in monitor.\nBest for business\nBest 5K business monitor\nThe Philips 40B1U6903CH proved to be professionally built and designed for productivity at stunning 5K definition.\nBest ultrawide\nBest 5K ultrawide monitor\nProfessional and practical in design, Dell's UltraSharp U4025QW is a beast for performance and productivity.\nBest for creatives\nBest 5K monitor for creatives\nWe like the design and color accuracy on display here - a good Studio Display alternative that's cheaper, has more ports, and works across Windows and macOS.\nSee more monitors\nBest for Mac\nBest 5K monitor for Mac\nIf you're part of the Apple ecosystem, the Studio Display is a good, but not great addition with ultra high resolutions.\nBest for gaming\nBest 5K monitor for gaming\nA 49in beast of a screen, the Samsung Odyssey CRG9 is designed with gamers in mind, featuring high refresh rates and response times.\nBest 5K monitor overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Dell UltraSharp U4924DW is the best 5K monitor for most uses - with a massive 49in curved display and stunning ultra high-resolution.\nIn use, we found using this monitor to be an immersive experience. There's plenty of scope for productivity and multi-tasking, too. During our months' long review, we found the sheer size of the screen changed our working practices for the better. We no longer felt cramped, free to open all the windows we wanted.\nThat, alone, is worth the admittedly high price of admission. Especially when you consider that it's not as curved as other models we've reviewed, and has a large, heavy footprint (you'll need plenty of sturdy desk space here).\nBut, then, you're getting a top 5K experience, and overall, we found it difficult to go back to our more traditional monitor for work after using this.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp U4924DW review\nBest 5K monitor on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe impressive Philips 499P9H is one of the more feature-packed ultrawide monitors we've tested. It was, once, our pick for best 5K monitor overall, but has since been superseded by newer monitors. Ok, it may be an older model, but don't let that fool you. This is still an impressive hi-res display at under $1000 / \u00a31000.\nIts VA panel is 8-bit, rather than IPS and 10-bit, and only supports the DisplayHDR 400 standard - so while it looks fine to the untrained eye, it's less suited to professional photo and video-editing work than its rivals. That\u2019s where our gripes end - this mammoth monitor features plenty of connectivity options, including a USB Type-C interface for hooking up a MacBook or other machine. In addition to the beautiful 32:9 aspect ratio, it goes further than rivals by including a pop-up webcam with Windows Hello Support for snappy face-ID login. The icing on the cake is its adaptive sync support, which makes it suitable for light gaming at 60fps if you have a capable AMD graphics card.\nAll around, this monitor is incredible to use, for productivity, this monitor is nearly too big and requires one of our largest desks in the studio to not look out of place. But once we found a good desk, this monitor made up for the work by allowing us to get so much done. We could have everything we needed and more on-screen without even thinking about adding a secondary screen or using our laptop in anything other than clamshell mode. This monitor has it all, and for productivity or creative work, this monitor is absolutely incredible.\nRead our full Philips Brilliance 499P9H review\nGet the best deal on Philips products with our Philips coupon codes.\nBest 8K monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTwo years after first clocking eyes on it, we're still drooling over the first 8K monitor to hit the shelves. The UP3218K justifies its cost in ways other than its sheer pixel count, which is so huge that finding content to take advantage of is no easy task. The monitor is adequately bright, features stellar build quality (surprisingly heavy), and its color reproduction is the best in the business. If you absolutely must have the sharpest screen that money can buy, this is it - but beware that it requires two DisplayPorts to run - so pairing it with a beefy GPU is a must.\nOnce we were able to get one of our higher-end PCs on this monitor, it became incredibly hard to want to use anything else. The clarity is absolutely astounding, there\u2019s no other way to say it. Sadly, there is not a ton of 8K content out there, but when using 8K content on this 8K screen, it\u2019s truly breath-taking. Granted, not everything has to be 8K to look amazing on this display, even 4K and 5K content looks great thanks to the amazing color accuracy and high brightness.\nThe one caveat we do need to mention one more time though, is that it takes a beast of a machine to run this monitor, so if you are interested in this display, make sure your computer of choice can output what is necessary to make this gorgeous monitor worth it.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp UP3218K 8K monitor review\nBest 5K monitor for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe were seriously impressed with the Philips 40B1U6903CH when we tested out this business monitor. Naturally, the 5K2K resolution is stunningly beautiful, clear, crisp - just as you'd expect. For us, this display delivered for all-purpose high-DPI computing on an epic scale.\nLike many of the Dell UltraSharp monitors, this is a productivity panel. Designed for professionals, it's well-built if somewhat traditional, somewhat familiar in appearance, though no less thoughtful. The panel features a headphone hook to the left, a 5MP pop-up webcam with Windows Hello support. There is also a KVM switch and two Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C ports with power delivery up to 90W connecting a laptop and daisy-chaining multiple monitors.\nHaving said that, our tests showed relatively low-fidelity in its image quality, coupled with limited HDR support. That may be a deal-breaker for some. For general use, however, this shouldn't prove an issue. Using the Philips 40B1U6903CH is a freeing experience, we found, with excellent connectivity.\nRead our full Philips 40B1U6903CH review\nBest 5K ultrawide monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt might be expensive, but the Dell UltraSharp U4025QW is an incredible productivity panel that spans 40-inches in glorious 5K2K resolution. Design language follows the usual, unmistakeable Dell style - although we like the addition of a small, pop-out hub along the bottom of the screen, allowing easy access to a USB-A and two USB-C ports. Smart thinking.\nDuring our testing, this 5K monitor excelled at productivity tasks, with more than enough screen space to handle multiple windows, tabs, apps, and the like, while the 120Hz refresh kept everything smooth and seamless.\nHowever, it is expensive, it is larger than standard displays, and to really get the most out of a 5K monitor like this, you'll need a powerful graphics card to drive it - we even noticed some slowdown when connected to an M2 MacBook Pro running too much.\nLike most displays from Dell, there's a clear business focus here. Boasting great color accuracy, too, this is an ideal companion device for content creators, designers, and photographers.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp U4025QW review\nGet the best deals with our Dell coupon codes.\nBest 5K monitor for creatives\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BenQ PD2730S is a 5K monitor specifically designed for creative professionals, turning the head of our reviewer, Collin, who found it an excellent alternative to the Apple Studio Display - especially since it includes more input and output options, includi9ng Thunderbolt 4.\nThis 27in 5K monitor has an IPS panel with Nano Matte coating, which limits on-screen reflections. Design-wise, the display is construction from a premium-feeling plastic that keeps it lightweight and pretty easy to move around. Saying that, it's not quite as premium as some monitors, and we wouldn't have minded a little extra weight to the unit. The bezels around the panel are slim, too. Around the back there's a VESA mount, while the coupled stand gave us no problems when it came to adjusting height, tilt, and swivel. It also comes with the HotKey puck, a wireless controller for changing settings on the fly.\nPerformance proved very good, scaling well across our PC and Mac tests (unlike some 5K monitors we've tried). As you'd expect from a 5K monitor for creatives, color accuracy is particularly good, hitting 98% P3 and 100% sRGB. However, the 400 nits brightness is about average - if you're using this in the home office, you shouldn't run into any issues at all (we certainly didn't during review) but it might struggle in direct sunlight.\nRead our full BenQ PD2730S review\nBest 5K monitor for Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Apple Studio Display is a monitor designed for creative professionals, specifically those with a Mac or MacBook Pro. It has a 27-inch 5K resolution display with a pixel density of 218 PPI and supports one billion colors, making it an excellent choice for photo and video editing tasks. It also features a P3 wide color gamut and 600 nits of brightness. The monitor has a sleek design and is available with a tilt-adjustable stand or a VESA mount adapter. However, the stand does not have height adjustability unless you pay an additional $400. The display is also compatible with Apple's True Tone technology, which adjusts the white balance to match ambient lighting conditions. However, this feature can be turned off for professionals who require high color accuracy. The screen is reflective, but upgrading to the nano-texture screen can minimize reflections.\nThe Apple Studio Display is expensive, and may not be suitable for those outside its target market of creative professionals. All that being said, this monitor is the perfect companion for those in the Apple Ecosystem. If you are looking for the best monitor for a Mac mini, Mac Studio, or even a Mac Pro, this might just be exactly what you are looking for. As is true with any product within the beautiful walled garden of Apple products, everything just works. The UI is uniform, certain features of the monitor, such as brightness, speakers control, and full control of the webcam can only be accessed from a Mac, and therefore, this monitor makes the most sense to use with a Mac.\nIt\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows though, we actually have found many members of our team who, while they love the Studio Display, are used to multi-inputs on their monitors, and therefore cannot get away with using this display at their workstation. The Studio Display has only a single input display, natively. You could use a switcher, a hub, or physically unplug the monitor from one Mac to another, like your Mac studio to your Macbook, or even your iPad (especially with iPadOS 17 and Stage Manager enabled). However, there is no internal ability to switch between inputs as is common on most modern monitors.\nRead our full Apple Studio Display review\nBrowse our Apple promo codes for more discounts.\nBest 5K monitor for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nProfessionals can be gamers too, which is why the CRG9 may be an enticing option. Its 5K display, flaunting Quantum Dot (QLED) tech and 1.07 billion colors, is gorgeous - and the monitor also sports VESA DisplayHDR 1000 tech backed up by 1,000 nits of pure room-illuminating brightness.\nFor gamers, adding adaptive-sync tech will smoothen out frame rates up to the panel's 144Hz refresh rate. You'll need a beefy GPU to maximize this enticing ultrawide. Oh, and deep pockets will be required - this is one expensive monitor.\nBut, if you can get past the gasp-inducing price tag, this beast is remarkably good. Because it is such a good gaming monitor and still a fantastic business monitor, you can switch between a legitimate gaming setup and spreadsheets without so much moving.\nGranted, not everyone has the space for a 49-inch monitor \u2013 this thing is gargantuan \u2013 but if you do, its 32:9 aspect ratio with 5120 x 1440 resolution might just be the best beast you can buy.\nRead our full Samsung CRG9 review\nBest 5K and 8K monitors: Compared\nModel | Screen size | Resolution | Color gamut |\n|---|---|---|---|\n49in | 5120 x 1440 | Rec 709: 100%, sRGB: 100%, DCI-P3: 98%, P3: 98% | |\n49in | 5120 x 1440 | sRGB: 121%, DCI-P3: 94.62% | |\n32in | 7680 x 4320 | sRGB: 100% | |\n40in | 5120 x 2160 | sRGB: 134% | |\n40in | 5120 x 1440 | sRGB: 99% | |\n27in | 5120 x 2880 | sRGB: 100%, P3: 98% | |\n27in | 5120 x 2880 | sRGB: 99%, DCI-P3: 98.2% | |\n49in | 5120 x 1440 | sRGB: 125%, DCI-P3: 95% |\nBest 5K and 8K monitors: Also tested\n\"If you crave maximum multitasking space and connectivity, Philips' new 49-inch ultrawide monitor absolutely delivers.

So, you won't see any advantage.\nHowever, if you work in the photo or video world and are working with 5K or 8K video or photo files, then a 5K or 8K monitor is essential. In our experience, the image quality at these resolutions is absolutely remarkable.\nIs 5K or 8K better than a 4K monitor?\nYes - if you're purely focused on resolution. The best 5K and 8K monitors crisply display details that 4K monitors can't match, since these monitors use 4840 x 2160 pixels.\nBut while 5K and 8K monitors have better image quality they are also significantly more expensive in most cases, and with less support for higher resolutions, they're not always necessary for most everyday monitor needs. It can also take longer to stream files at the higher 5K and 8K resolutions.\nWhat are the benefits of a 5K or 8K display?\nThe main benefits of a 5K or 8K display are the increased picture quality, higher resolution, and sharper visual experience. However, those visuals differences aren't always clear to the naked eye.\nHow to choose the best 5K and 8K monitors for you\nWhen choosing which 5K or 8K monitor is best for you, there are several key factors at play. Like any of the best monitors, size isn't everything. Like 4K before it, the best 5K and 8K monitors are another big jump in quality, price, and requirements.\nRight now, 5K and 8K monitors are a serious investment. For most users, a 4K monitor will be enough. Even if you're a creator looking for the best monitor for photo editing or the best video editing monitor, a 4096 \u00d7 2160 resolution is enough for most regular creative tasks. Generally, those who need a 5k or 8k monitor are professionals in design, photography, and videography, where detail and color accuracy are critical.\nFor 5K monitors (5120 \u00d7 2880 pixels), you can choose regular 16:9 aspect ratio or ultrawide monitors with 21:9 (or above) aspect ratios. The best ultrawide monitors are a great choice for a multi-monitor experience with a single screen.\nMonitors with a regular aspect ratio are generally better for design work as high-DPI modes in Windows and macOS allow for working in scaled resolutions, which lets users zoom in to manipulate images in incredible detail while rendering pin-sharp text and UI elements. However, ultra-wide monitors present an intriguing alternative that ignores pixel scaling to give professionals acres of screen space for positioning windows, stretching out video-editing timelines, and watching cinematic videos as intended.\nYour choice of 8K monitors (7680 \u00d7 4320 pixels), is limited, as currently, there aren't many 'affordable' 8K screens beyond the Dell UltraSharp UP3218K. It's an excellent screen in its own right, but we'd like to start seeing this market in particular flourish. There is nothing quite as sharp as 8K. In our experience, the best 8K monitors are significantly more demanding; therefore, most devices cannot output, so it\u2019s essential to ensure that your computer can push to 8K if you are interested. Because of this, 5K is supported by far more devices than 8K. If you're integrating higher resolution displays into your workflow, make sure the output is compatible.\nHow we test the best 5K and 8K monitors\nOur team of expert reviewers have hand-tested hundreds of screens, from the best monitors for the Mac mini to the best monitors for graphic design. So, we know what to look out for and what to avoid when it comes to high-performance, high-resolution displays.\nWhether we're comparing refresh rates on the best MacBook Pro monitors or analyzing luminance of the best curved monitors, we take the same rigorous approach to all our screen tests.\nIn testing out the best 5K and 8K monitors, we use the monitor for daily use, paying close attention to inteded use, for example, playing triple-A games at max settings on the best gaming monitors, editing images with photography monitors, and so on. We push the monitor to the limits in terms of testing color accuracy, brightness, response times, and refresh rates.\nEqually important to confirming specifications, our team will confirm how the monitor functions in day to day use. This will be done by utilizing the monitor for the tester\u2019s workload for an extended period of time so they can get comfortable with the nuances of each monitor (eye strain, productivity, stands, and curvature, to name a few) and things like connectivity and even power consumption.\nFor on-the-go displays, we reviewed the best portable monitors.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSteve is B2B Editor for Creative & Hardware at TechRadar Pro.

Asus' 6K rival to Pro Display XDR will debut within weeks and will cost a fraction of its Apple rival\nMacBook users can tweak this monitor like it\u2019s part of the Apple ecosystem\n- Asus ProArt PA32QCV offers 6K clarity and HDR600 without the eye-watering XDR price\n- Factory-calibrated color accuracy claims sound good on paper, but longevity remains an open question\n- HDR10 support and 10-bit color make this panel interesting for high-contrast workflows\nAsus has announced the ProArt Display PA32QCV, a 6K-resolution business monitor aimed at creative professionals who require accurate color and sharp detail.\nPriced at $1,299, it undercuts Apple\u2019s $4,999 Pro Display XDR while targeting similar use cases in media production.\nThe PA32QCV delivers 6K visuals at 6016x3384 resolution, producing a pixel density of 218 pixels per inch, more than three times that of a standard 1080p monitor.\nProArt PA32QCV brings impressive specs that remain to be tested\nThis device also supports HDR10 and meets the VESA DisplayHDR 600 standard, which allows for brighter highlights, deeper contrast, and are particularly useful when working with high-dynamic-range content. The extra detail helps with crisper text, sharper lines, and more precise visuals.\nIn terms of color accuracy, Asus promises factory-calibrated Delta E<2 performance, backed by Calman Verification. The display covers 98% of the DCI-P3 color space, and it also offers 100% sRGB support and 10-bit depth, delivering over a billion colors.\nThis makes it a strong option for video editing and other color-critical tasks, although how long the factory calibration remains accurate is unclear.\nThe monitor includes dual Thunderbolt 4 ports, supporting data transfer, charging, and video passthrough through a single cable.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOther connectivity options include HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-A, and additional USB-C ports.\nAuto KVM support adds flexibility, letting users control two connected computers with a single keyboard and mouse.\nThese features suggest it could serve well not only as a display for photo editing but also as a capable all-purpose business monitor.\nAsus also emphasizes Mac compatibility. macOS users can adjust settings using the DisplayWidget Center app.\nA new M Model-P3 preset aligns the display\u2019s output with macOS devices.\nUsers can change brightness, contrast, and color temperature with a mouse, and MacBook brightness keys can control the monitor directly.\nThis may appeal to Mac-focused creatives, although such software tools often lack long-term support.\nAsus is promoting a Creative Cloud giveaway with the display in some markets, but the value of bundled software depends on the user\u2019s needs.\nThe bigger question is whether this 6K screen, despite its impressive specs, will meet the demands of professionals over time.\nVia Techpowerup\nYou might also like\n- Here are the best mobile workstations around today\n- We've also listed the best monitors for every budget and resolution\n- Lenovo launches white ThinkPad with four ports, no red TrackPoint, and no physical touchpad buttons\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe BenQ EW2790 is a fantastic all around monitor, particularly if you want to use it for non-work hours on top of your working hours. The BenQ EW2790U is an excellent 4K panel with solid color accuracy, decent speakers, fantastic IO, and a unique look, making a surprisingly reasonable budget monitor very tempting for almost anyone.\nPros\n- +\n4K UHD Resolution\n- +\n95% DCI-P3 color coverage\n- +\nBetter-than-average speakers\n- +\nGreat ports\nCons\n- -\nOnly 60Hz\n- -\nNo DisplayPort\n- -\nUSB-C PD is limited to 65W\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nI review monitors as a significant portion of my work here at TechRadar Pro. I've tried more than most, and I have a good sense of what monitor I'd be willing to buy for real-world use and what is good on paper. That's partially due to the fact that I am still very much in the \"regular\" workforce as well, using all sorts of different setups, computers, monitors, and so on. With all that being said, I had forgotten how affordable this monitor was during my testing phase and realized it was only $360 when I sat down to write the review and double-checked the specs.\nThere is a plethora of 4K monitors on the market right now, ranging from budget options that are not worth the money to absurdly overpriced models. We have excellent guides if you're looking for some of the best business monitors right now, but what is truly impressive about this EW2790U is that, for only $360, you get a great 4K panel packed with features, not just a bare panel.\nBenQ EW2790U: Pricing & Availability\nThe EW Series currently has three variants: the EW3290U at $549.99, the EW2790U at $359.99, and the EW2790Q at $329.99. The Q model has a lower resolution (2560x1440) but a higher refresh rate of 100Hz compared to the EW2790U. Outside of that, the displays are identical. The EW3290U, then, is essentially the same as the EW2790U, but with a larger screen and an improved speaker system.\nBenQ displays are sold through the BenQ website and at major retailers and are frequently available at discounted prices. If you are in the market for a new panel and want a BenQ, be sure to do some searching to check for deals.\nBenQ EW2790U: Unboxing & first impressions\nThe BenQ EW2790U comes with a monitor, a slimmer stand than other BenQ monitors, a USB-C cable, a power cable (IEC), and a quick guide. Right off the bat, the visible speakers stand out, there's no doubt about that. Additionally, the white bezel is a bit different than most black bezel monitors. However, after having it out of the box for a little while, I grew accustomed to it, and now I don't mind it at all.\nI had the monitor on the stand it came with for about 15 seconds to see how it worked. Then I moved the display to one of my monitor arms because I'm pretty sure I've reached my limit, and all my monitors need to be on one of my monitor arms for aesthetic reasons, to keep the desk clean, and for cable management.\nBenQ EW2790U: Design & build quality\nDisplay: 27-inch IPS\nResolution: 3840x2160\nContrast Ratio: 1,000:1\nRefresh Rate: 60Hz\nResponse Time: 5ms\nColor Profile: 95% DCI-P3\nThere have been a few BenQ monitors now that I have tested that has a non-standard white bezel frame, and I have really grown to like it in the right space. It feels modern and fun, reminding me that I can enjoy this space and the work I am doing and not just feel like work is work.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe visible speakers are something that I haven't seen before in a monitor, but now I barely even see them as odd since I have seen them so frequently at this point.\nThe port offering on the back is another build quality that I was not expecting on a budget monitor in the slightest. Most budget monitors have minimal ports, I've seen some with a single HDMI port to save money. This monitor, though, has three HDMI, two USB-C (one that can plug into your computer, one for accessories), three USB-A, a headphone jack, and an IEC port for power (not a cheap barrel connector like a lot of budget displays have).\nBenQ EW2790U: In use\nAlright I'll admit it, I have a problem. After only about 15 seconds of having this monitor on the stand it came with, just long enough to test it out and see how it functions, I threw this display on one of my monitor arms. I just love the look and function. But that's not to say anything negative about the stand that BenQ sends with the monitor, because I don't mind it. It's minimalist, has some nice mobility to it, and it's pretty.\nMoving on, this display has been running my secondary setup for 105 days at the time of writing this review. For 105 days I have run every computer through this monitor to test specs and performance, I've had it in the background of every meeting, I've had my son play games on it, and watch shows on it while I'm working, I've had friends co-work from it, and I've even had it play a podcast or two just because I can and it's that easy.\nFor productivity, this display is great. The 27-inch size is industry standard for a reason, it's a sweet spot. That, along with the 16:9 aspect ratio and 4K resolution, works well with almost every computer. What makes this unit unique though is that with the tap of a button you can swap color profiles, audio modes, display modes and volume and jump to a totally different profile for a different device all together.\nSo, you could have your productivity setup with your standard visuals, vocal audio mode, and USB-C port, and then with the touch of a button you can be ready for gaming after hours, or watching content on your lunch break. And, with the three HDMIs, you can plug in a gaming system, an Apple TV, and a work dock all while still keeping your personal laptop or tablet plugged in via USB-C. Oh, and don't forget this is a budget monitor.\nThe speakers are not ground breaking, but I will say that they are better than the vast majority of other monitors and would more compare to a TVs speakers in my mind. They're good, you won't be upset with the quality but you also won't be mind blown by them. For music I could tolerate non-descript background music but anything I know well I felt like I was missing out on some parts. For virtual meetings the audio profiles were excellent, same with podcasts or videos I was watching.\nBenQ EW2790U: Final verdict\nThe BenQ EW2790U is a spectacular budget 4K monitor with phenomenal port offerings, fabulous features and a unique design. If you're looking for a full-featured budget monitor, or even just a full-featured monitor and you aren't as worried about the price, you'll want to check this display out before you make any other purchases.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Unique and clean design | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Easy for all to use | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPracticality | Practical for most who need monitors | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPrice | Great price | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nFormer TechRadar Pro B2B Hardware Editor, Collin has been in journalism for years, with experience in small and large markets, including Gearadical, DailyBeast, FutureNet, and more.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

Detail is the whole point of 4K \u2013 most of the time, you won\u2019t be able to see the pixels in a 4K display, so everything looks natural and sharp. It\u2019s great for photos, videos and gaming for this reason, but actually it\u2019s superior for just about everything \u2013 it\u2019s nicer when text looks smoother on a computer, for example.\nThe vast majority of the time, 4K refers to a specific resolution of 3840 x 2160 (which is also known as \u2018Ultra HD\u2019) \u2013 this is the resolution of all 4K TVs and 4K video streams from the likes of Netflix or YouTube. Some cameras record in what\u2019s often known as \u2018Cinema 4K\u2019, which is a resolution of 4096 x 2160. You may find that some computer monitors refer to themselves as 4K, and will have a horizontal resolution around 4,000 pixels, but have a different height to the resolutions mentioned above, such as ultra-wide monitors. The width is what makes something 4K or not.\nYou\u2019ll mostly see 4K referred to in TVs of 40 inches and above, in computer and laptop monitors, on video streaming services, and in video recording on cameras or phones.\nLatest about 4K\nBenQ has released a pro 4K monitor that has something no rival offers: a 2.1 sound system with a small but useful woofer\nBy Wayne Williams published\nBenQ launches 32-inch 4K monitor with color calibrated visuals and a built in 2.1 sound system including a compact woofer.\nThe 17 best Xbox One X games\nBy Vic Hood, Stephen Lambrechts, Jake Green last updated\nBuying Guide Microsoft's 4K HDR games consoles is still a powerhouse, especially now you can pick it up so cheap.
