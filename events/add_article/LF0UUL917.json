      "summary": "The average 30‑year fixed‑rate mortgage in the U.S. is 6.548% as of Aug. 27 2025, up 2 bp from the prior day and down 8 bp from a week earlier, and has hovered near 7% since the Fed began cutting rates in September 2024.  Fed policy, inflation expectations, national debt, and loan demand are the main drivers keeping rates elevated, while the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction is also contributing to upward pressure.  Homebuyers can still negotiate buydowns or shop multiple lenders to mitigate costs, but refinancing is only worthwhile if a rate drop of at least 1 % can be secured.",
