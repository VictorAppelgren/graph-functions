  "content": "September ICE NY cocoa (CCU25) on Tuesday closed up +15 (+0.17%), and September ICE London cocoa #7 (CAU25) closed up +68 (+1.18%).\n\nNY cocoa prices on Tuesday continued to see strength after Monday's +3% upward spike to a 2-month high. Cocoa prices on Monday rallied on concern about dry weather in West Africa that threatens the region's cocoa crops. There has been little to no precipitation over the past few weeks in the cocoa growing areas of Ivory Coast and Ghana, which could negatively impact the development of flowers and cherelles on cocoa plants. According to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, rainfall in the Ivory Coast and Ghana this season remains below the 30-year average, and combined with high temperatures, risks hurting cocoa pod development for the main crop harvest that starts in October.\n\u2022 What Game Is Being Played in Grains Early Monday Morning?\n\u2022 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief \u2013 your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nSigns of tighter cocoa supplies are bullish for prices after ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to a 2-month low of 2,248,784 bags Tuesday.\n\nCocoa has support from the slowdown in the pace of Ivory Coast cocoa exports. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.78 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to August 10, up +6.6% from last year but down from the much larger +35% increase seen in December.\n\nQuality concerns regarding the Ivory Coast's mid-crop cocoa, which is currently being harvested through September, are supportive of prices. Cocoa processors are complaining about the quality of the crop and have rejected truckloads of Ivory Coast cocoa beans. Processors reported that about 5% to 6% of the mid-crop cocoa in each truckload is of poor quality, compared with 1% during the main crop. According to Rabobank, the poor quality of the Ivory Coast's mid-crop is partly attributed to late-arriving rain in the region, which limited crop growth. The mid-crop is the smaller of the two annual cocoa harvests, which typically starts in April. The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, down -9% from last year's 440,000 MT.\n\nAnother supportive factor for cocoa is smaller cocoa production in Nigeria, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer. Nigeria's Cocoa Association projects Nigeria's 2025/25 cocoa production will fall -11% y/y to 305,000 MT from a projected 344,000 MT for the 2024/25 crop year. In related news, Nigeria's Jun cocoa exports rose +0.9% y/y to 14,597 MT.",
