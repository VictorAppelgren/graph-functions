  "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Novak Djokovic thinks he came up with a way to get Serena Williams back on the tennis tour: Dare her to do it.\n\nA night after Williams stunned the tennis world by showing up to help induct rival Maria Sharapova into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, Djokovic said he thought that was \"a beautiful moment.\"\n\n\"It was surprising, but a very nice gesture from Serena to be there for Maria,\" Djokovic said Sunday night after winning his first-round match at the U.S. Open. \"They had some really intense rivalries and incredible matches over the years.\"\n\nThen he turned his thoughts to Williams, she of the 23 Grand Slam singles titles, one fewer than Djokovic's total.\n\nWilliams left tennis after playing at the 2022 U.S. Open, saying at the time she preferred to think of herself as \"evolving\" away from the sport rather than retiring.\n\n\"Of course, seeing Serena in any shape or form around tennis is great. You know, we miss her,\" Djokovic said, then added with a wry smile: \"She still hasn't officially retired.\"\n\nAnd then he added: \"So I invite her. I challenge her. Because she's such a great competitor, when somebody challenges her, she never refuses. So I challenge Serena: Come back on the tour next year.\"\n\nWilliams turns 44 next month. Her older sister, Venus, who is 45, will be playing in a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in two years at the U.S. Open on Monday night, after returning to the tour in July.",

      "text": "Djokovic improves to 19-0 in the first round of the US Open, wins his first match since Wimbledon\nDjokovic improves to 19-0 in the first round of the US Open, wins his first match since Wimbledon\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic looked tired. He looked hurt. And at times Sunday night, he just looked old.\nDjokovic overcame all that and improved to 19-0 in the first round of the U.S. Open, battling through some leg troubles to beat Learner Tien 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2.\nBut the 38-year-old acknowledged concern after laboring through the middle of his first match since Wimbledon.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have any injury or anything. I just struggled a lot to stay in long exchanges and recover after points,\u201d Djokovic said.\nDjokovic had his hands on his knees multiple times in the second set and received treatment for a blister on his right big toe after it. But after having his serve broken in the first game of the third set, he won the next five games to regain control.\nIt was the 24-time Grand Slam champion\u2019s first match since falling to Jannik Sinner in the Wimbledon semifinals, when he struggled with an upper left leg injury, and one that made it tough to tell if he remains a real contender to win a fifth title in Flushing Meadows. He rolled through the first set in just 24 minutes, then looked weary in a second set that took nearly an hour longer.\n\u201cI started great. Just over 20 minutes, first set, I felt really good,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cThen some long games to start the second set, and then I started to feel really \u2014 I don\u2019t know why. I really was surprised how bad I was feeling in the second physically.\u201d\nThe No. 7-seeded Djokovic has made a career of wearing down his opponents, but he looked like the one who was feeling it physically in the second set against an opponent from California who was half his age.\n\u201cTo be quite honest with you, I wish I had Learner Tien\u2019s age but that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Djokovic said in his post-match interview.\nHis face reddened and he was huffing and puffing so much by the time the tiebreaker arrived that he received his second time violation of the match during it, costing him a first serve.\nTien won the point on Djokovic\u2019s second serve to tie it at 3-all, before Djokovic won the next four points.\nHe was then visited by the trainer at his seat. Djokovic had appeared to be bothered by his lower left leg late in the set, but it was his right foot that received treatment during the medical timeout.\nDjokovic felt better in the third set, pulling away for his 75th consecutive first-round win at a Grand Slam tournament.\nHe hasn\u2019t won one of them since his win at the U.S. Open in 2023. Djokovic opted to skip all the hard-court tournaments leading into this year\u2019s last major of the season, which perhaps contributed to him looking winded Sunday.\nBut Tien isn\u2019t ruling out a run for the Serbian.\n\u201cObviously Sinner and (Carlos) Alcaraz, those guys are playing extremely well, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever count him out,\u201d Tien said. \u201cI think he has the ability to play his best tennis and kind of peak when he needs it most, so I\u2019m going to say that he\u2019s got a shot.\u201d\nPerhaps Djokovic will be helped by an extra day of rest before his second-round match, thanks to playing on the first day of a tournament that now starts on Sunday, a day earlier.\n\u201cThere are positives but also things that hopefully won\u2019t happen in terms of, like, how I feel on the court physically the way I felt in the second set,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cHopefully that doesn\u2019t happen, because then it makes my life on the court definitely much more challenging.\u201d\n___\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis"

(AP) \u2014 Serena Williams made a surprise \u2014 and early \u2014 appearance at the International Tennis Hall of Fame, emerging from behind the stage to introduce \u201cformer rival, former fan and forever friend\u201d Maria Sharapova for her induction on Saturday night.\nWilliams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion who will be eligible for her own enshrinement in 2027, drew gasps and shrieks from the crowd at the Newport shrine.\n\u201cThere are only a few players in my career who challenged me to be the very best, every single time we stepped out on the court,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMaria Sharapova was one of them. Whenever I saw her name next to mine in the draw, I made sure I practiced harder.\u201d\nAnd the feeling was mutual.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gift to have someone who motivates you to reach those heights. And I\u2019ll forever be grateful for bringing out the best in me,\u201d Sharapova said in her acceptance speech. \u201cWe both knew no other way than to fight our hearts out. ... We both hated to lose more than anything on this earth, and we both knew that the other was the biggest obstacle between ourselves and the trophy.\u201d\nThe first Russian woman ever to reach No. 1 in the rankings and one of 10 women to complete the career Grand Slam, Sharapova was joined in the Class of 2025 by dominating doubles team Mike and Bob Bryan. The twin brothers finished their speech with one of their trademark chest bumps.\nHall of Famers Martina Navratilova, Jim Courier, Stan Smith and Andy Roddick were among those in the crowd, wearing their blue Hall of Fame blazers. Sharapova and the Bryan brothers also received a cast tennis racket that is the hall\u2019s newest offering to inductees.\nSharapova was described in her introductory video as someone who \u201ccombined grit with glamour,\u201d and some of the stylish outfits she competed in are already displayed in the hall \u2014 including a tuxedo-inspired dress she wore at Wimbledon in 2008.\nWilliams noted that her rival was the highest-paid female athlete in the world for 11 straight years \u2014 bolstered by endorsement income that surpassed her on-court winnings.\n\u201cShe showed us all how to take excellence on the court and turn it into excellence in business, and fashion, branding and everything that she touched,\u201d Williams said. \u201cShe changed how women not only approached tennis, but sports and opportunity. She showed us that you can be fierce on the court and strategic off the court, and unapologetically herself the entire time.\u201d\nSharapova said her induction gave her a chance to look back \u2014 something she tried not to do when she was playing. And she credited her success to \u201cembracing the struggles and leaning into the hard stuff.\u201d\n\u201cWhen voices inevitably tell you to ease up, to round your edges, dull your ambition, I hope you can find a way to ignore them,\u201d she said. \u201cCompete fiercely. Raise your standard. Set goals that intimidate you. And don\u2019t forget to celebrate your victories, no matter how small.\n\u201cIn giving my life to tennis, tennis gave me a life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what a remarkable, remarkable life. And I\u2019m so deeply grateful for it.\u201d\nThe Bryans shared a speech as if they were taking turns hitting on a court, alternating at the microphone as they thanked coaches, friends and Davis Cup teammates from a career in which they won 119 ATP titles, including 16 Grand Slams, and an Olympic gold medal. They spent a record 438 weeks atop the world rankings.\nNavratilova, who won the 2006 U.S. Open mixed doubles title with Bob Bryan, credited the brothers for keeping the doubles disciplines from being forgotten.\n\u201cNot too many athletes transcend their sport,\u201d she said. \u201cFor twins to do it is amazing.\u201d\nBob Bryan said he was fortunate because \u201cfor most of my career, I had the No. 1 player in the world across the hall.\u201d\n\u201cDoubles was our love from Day 1,\u201d Mike Bryan said. \u201cWe loved everything about doubles. We loved the strategy, the teamwork, sharing the highs and lows. Like our personalities, our games complemented each other perfectly.\u201d\n___\nThis story has been corrected to delete an erroneous reference to Sharapova winning Wimbledon in 2008.
