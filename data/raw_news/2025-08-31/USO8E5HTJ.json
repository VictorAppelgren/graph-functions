  "content": "Android Battery Going Down While You Charge It? Here's What You Can Do\n\nWith some of the most powerful smartphone processors being used in not just flagship-grade, but also mid-range options, running graphically intensive apps and games has become second nature. Increased horsepower might suggest significantly worse battery performance with every iteration, but that's actually not true at all. Newer processors are not just powerful, but also efficient \u2014 and with battery capacities physically creeping up, most modern phones don't struggle to make it past a full day. When the time comes and you spot the low battery notification, you realize that charging options have also never been more convenient. You have wireless charging, super-fast wired charging, or some devices, like the OnePlus 13 we reviewed, come with incredibly quick wireless charging as well. Some of the more common battery issues with phones include slow charging, faster drain, or overheating \u2014 but all of these problems pale in comparison to when you plug in your phone and it still loses charge. There are a multitude of reasons as to why this may happen, but inspecting your phone battery's age and the charger's specifications is often the most effective way to find a solution.\n\nGone are the days when you would receive a handful of accessories in the box with your purchase. Most smartphones now only ship with a USB cable that can be used for charging and data transfer. This means you, as a consumer, are responsible for picking the best power adapter \u2014 something that can ideally deliver the maximum charging speeds to your phone while not posing any risk of overheating. Sure, with USB Power Delivery being adopted by many premium smartphones, things become a little less confusing when shopping for the right charger. That said, it is quite easy to mistakenly use a weaker charger to top up your phone. The best way to discern which power adapter is ideal is to refer to your phone's technical specifications or product page. A compatible charger and cable will ensure that you get the fastest possible charging speeds. If you've been using the same phone for a few years, it's likely that battery health has significantly deteriorated. There are third-party apps that will help you check the battery health of your Android phone. Modern iPhones can display this number in Settings > Battery > Battery Health. Your smartphone might notify you if its battery has aged enough to warrant a replacement. A degraded battery may struggle to hold a charge consistently, especially if you're using your phone while it's charging.\n\nThough uncommon and often easier to spot, apps running in the background of your phone may contribute to battery drain, even when it is asleep or charging. Being on the lookout for any suspicious apps or services is also a good way to strengthen your phone's data and privacy. Graphically demanding games like \"Call of Duty: Mobile\" or \"Genshin Impact\" can dial things to eleven, causing your phone to overheat \u2014 subsequently placing a hold on charging. This could be another reason why your phone might be draining battery despite being plugged in. Again, running into this issue too often likely warrants a battery replacement or a switch to a more compatible power adapter. A fresh battery can not just help your phone with endurance, but also bring back most of the performance from day one. Avoid charging your phone if it is already hot \u2014 heat can negatively affect battery health, so be sure to place your phone in a cooler environment while charging. There are other common tips that can help you maximize battery life on your phone, including dimming your screen, disabling GPS or Bluetooth when not in use, and following good charging habits like not leaving your phone plugged in at 100% too often for too long. Under dire circumstances, the power saver mode on your phone can extend battery life by restricting background services and dropping the display's refresh rate.",

      "text": "OnePlus 13 Review: The Smartphone To Beat In 2025\nLook, I'm not going to tell you that you should ever want or need to put your smartphone in a dishwasher. But I am saying if you wanted to or needed to, and you had a OnePlus 13, you could; and I did.\nIs this an absurd way to talk about a smartphone? Yes. Yes, it is. But here we are. Is this the reason you should buy the OnePlus 13? No, it is not. But it is one of many reasons you absolutely should buy this smartphone. It's the most ridiculous reason, which is why I love it. I don't love every part of this phone, but I love a lot of it.\nI would argue, that this generation of OnePlus smartphone is something of a coming of age for this phone. OnePlus has been a lot of things to a lot of people. It's a source of fierce devotion by its fanbase. It's a \"local boy done good\" in the eyes of its early fans. It's the (insert the name of one of two popular phone makers in the U.S.) alternative phone maker. It can still be all of those things, but all of those sell this phone short. This is a damn fine smartphone in its own right, and I'm here to tell you about it. I've been using a OnePlus 13 review phone provided by OnePlus, and this is my full review.\nIt's all right here\nWhen I reviewed the OnePlus 11 in 2023, I told you that you should not sleep on this flagship. Last year's OnePlus 12 got a lot of things right for the price. To this day, I stand by those words. But I feel like that was a sort of \"old OnePlus\" mentality. If I said \"don't sleep on the iPhone 16 Pro\" you all would very seriously question my reviewer credentials, and phone knowledge in general, and rightly so. It's absurd. Of course no one is going to sleep on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nThis year, OnePlus has upped its game in a real way. This phone can be and should be compared to the Samsungs and iPhones of the world, because it will compare very favorably to them. It's just as good. That's it; that's the review. Of course, we need to talk about why, and I think by the end, you'll see what I'm talking about. For now, let's dive in.\nPremium hardware for the premium tier\nOnePlus has had the same design language for the past few generations. You get a slim profile with a camera island that is large, round, and not subtle. OnePlus went with a flatter edge that it has in the past, but it retains its glass backplate for two of the three colorways \u2014 Black Eclipse and Arctic Dawn (white). My review sample is the Midnight Ocean colorway (blue) but it's a faux leather backplate that is just lovely to hold.\nThe hardware is typical beyond that point with the power and volume rocker on the right side of the phone and the silence switch on the left. On the front, you get a 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED QHD+ display with a dynamic refresh rate of 120Hz. Underneath, you can get RAM/ROM configurations of 12GB/256GB or 16GB/512GB. The base model only comes in black, while the premium version can be had in any of the three colorways. Personally, I'm a Midnight ocean fan.\nThe two main highlights of the phone are the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which was just announced this past October at Snapdragon Summit, and the 6,000 mAh Silicon Nanostack battery with 80W of wired charging or 50W of wireless charging \u2014 assuming you use the cable and charger that come in the box. The 50W wireless charger is a separate accessory you can buy for $79.99.\nIP69 certified\nOnePlus also made its flagship phone IP69 complaint, which is a first for a phone sold in the U.S. You're probably familiar with IP68 water and dust ratings. That means that a phone can sit in about three feet of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. The OnePlus 13 adds jet sprays to the mix, and water temperature of up to 167 degrees.\nSalt water can still be bad, so if you find yourself in an ocean with your OnePlus 13, you should absolutely try to avoid getting it wet at all, but if you do, be sure to run it under fresh water as soon as possible. But if your phone gets muddy, or dirty, you can go ahead and toss the phone under a hose or into a dishwasher. It can also survive a tumble in the clothes washer if you happen to forget to take it out of a pocket. All of this is assuming the temperature doesn't get above 167 degrees, so keep that in mind as well.\nSo confident was OnePlus about these claims that it brought a portable dishwasher and washing machine to our briefing and had a phone running in both.\nOxygenOS adds AI and optimizations to the mix\nWe had a good run, but OnePlus has officially joined the AI bandwagon. The company added a number of different AI-powered features to the operating system like Circle to Search and AI unblur. One neat feature it added is called Reflection remover. If you've ever tried to take a photo through a window or maybe an art exhibit under glass, reflections can be a bit of a pain. Reflection remover removes them, and pretty darn well. The only exception to that is when I took a photo of a cruise ship model in a glass case, and it removed all the reflections except the reflections of the ship itself and you can see below (left is before, right is after).\nAnother thing that OnePlus did that it was so very proud of was it rebuilt the way Android animates apps. Specifically, when an app opens, it gets bigger frame by frame until it takes up the whole screen. Well, if you were to return to the home screen and launch a second app while that first was in the process of launching, Android had to kill that other process in the middle and there was a stutter before the new app started to open. OnePlus fixed that so the new process could be started right away instead of waiting a few extra frames for the first one to be done.\nTo be frank, this doesn't really matter, unless you're someone who continually opens and closes apps to marvel at how smooth the experience is. But it's there now, so marvel away. Everyone else, just go about your business. Still, OnePlus was extremely excited to tell you about it \u2014 I can't emphasize this enough \u2014 so now I have told you.\nThe cameras are very good\nThis is arguably the best set of cameras that OnePlus has shipped on a phone thus far. They are very good. It's a typical set of triple cameras in terms of the specifications. There's a 50-megapixel main camera for f/1.6 aperture, a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera with 120-degree field of view, and a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. On the front, you get a 32-megapixel shooter with f/2.45 aperture and 90-degree field of view. All of these cameras are quite good, even in low light. You get consistent colors \u2014 though the ultrawide tends to overexpose a bit and you can capture exquisite detail.\nIf you zoom in to a 100% crop, you can find some pixelation in the darker areas, but you need to go looking. Walking video is also not amazing as the lights go down, but there's a bigger margin where stabilized video is actually pretty good. You don't get a lot of judder you normally would in footsteps when you step inside for example. In total darkness, yes stabilization still has problems, but if you're shooting while stationary, it's quite good.\nMeanwhile, the 32-megapixel selfie shooter is fine, but it's a little bit hazy in most of the shots. Ironically, the only shot in which it wasn't hazy was when I submerged it (and myself) for an underwater selfie. Go figure.\nTwo key areas\nThere are two areas of the camera that OnePlus was quick to emphasize \u2014 long distance and action shots. In terms of long distance, OnePlus told me to go to 30x, no question. 30x shots will be great. Ok, challenge accepted. My first shot was of the smoke stacks of our cruise ship shot from the beach half a mile away. The two shots below will illustrate. The left photo is taken of the ship from the beach to give context. The second shot is what the phone's camera did when zoomed in.\nThe second set illustrates a lighthouse that was over two miles away, on a separate island from our ship's dock.\nBear in mind \u2014 these are relatively squarish structures with straight lines. It'd be pretty easy for a computer to fix up a situation like that. But still, these shots are pretty remarkable.\nThe other area, action shots comes in when you activate burst mode. The phone takes multiple exposures and combines them into one sharp image. We've heard that before, but OnePlus brought the receipts. These two shots show that functionality off pretty well. The first on the left is a shot from a fountain at a water park where you can see each and every individual drop of water. The second is a splash I made in a swimming pool.\nI've never seen photos like these processed with results this nice with such consistency. It's really remarkable.\nLet's talk about power\nI will tell you the same thing about battery life that I have said about every other OnePlus phone I have reviewed in the past four years \u2014 I have no idea what the battery life of this phone is. I can tell you it's really good, but I can also tell you it doesn't matter. OnePlus changes your charging relationship with your phone's battery. The phone can charge from dead to full in under 30 minutes. It can go from 1% to 50% in 23 minutes. If you need to go out somewhere, plug in your phone while you put on shoes and socks and get your coat on \u2014 you'll have enough juice to last you all night.\nSimilarly, with wireless charging, you can charge at up to 50W. Of course, both of these figures assume you are using the OnePlus charging brick and cable (and magnetic wireless charger sold separately) but that's mitigated by the fact that OnePlus ships the brick and cable in the box. The only annoyance with all of this is that OnePlus does not use the Qi2 standard magnets in the phone. \"But Adam, didn't you just say that OnePlus has a magnetic wireless charger?\" I did, but there are no magnets in the phone.\nRather, the official cases OnePlus makes include magnets in the back. Put simply, this is really annoying. When asked why they didn't just put magnets in the phone, OnePlus indicated that there were several factors that weighed into the decision \u2014 cost, antenna placement, and thickness were among them. I am not an engineer, nor do I play one on TV, but as the MagSafe fanboy that I am, I hate it.\nSnapdragon on board\nThe OnePlus 13 also carries the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor \u2014 the first in the U.S. to do so, and this processor is a beast. In benchmark testing, the OnePlus 13 beats the iPhone 16 Pro Max in most categories, save Geekbench's single core score \u2014 3,043 for OnePlus and 3,443 for iPhone. The multi-core test (9247 vs 8160) and the 3D Mark Wild Life Extreme stress test best loop scores (24,627 vs 4,225) both handily beat the iPhone 16 Pro Max (and the Mediatek Dimensity 9400 by the way).\nIn terms of gaming this phone flies. \"Genshin Impact\" can run at high graphic settings flawlessly. Other games like \"Call of Duty: Mobile\" and \"Asphalt Legends\" also run without a hiccup. During the Wild Life Stress Test, I clocked the back of the phone at 116 degrees Fahrenheit, which is definitely hot to the touch, but not so hot that you can't hold the phone. Needless to say, the phone is a powerhouse.\nOnePlus 13 Price, availability, and verdict\nThis is one of the best phones I've ever tested in almost every way. This is a bit of revelation for the company. No longer is the OnePlus flagship \"good enough\" \u2014 it's just as good as anything anyone else produces. That's saying a lot. OnePlus has inserted itself into the conversation in a meaningful way.\nThere are a few minor quibbles that some of the more diehard fans might find to be deal breakers. The lack of true Qi2 is maddening, but it's hard to ding a phone maker for something that no other phone maker has done. Nighttime video is still a weak point, but that's literally every phone's weakest point (from a camera perspective). Beyond that, this phone is pretty great.\nEven better, is the price. The OnePlus 13 starts at $899 for the base model and $999 for the next tier up. OnePlus has a number of deals that you can take advantage of including early bird deals, trade in deals, and a free upgrade to the next level of storage. It's available at OnePlus.com, Amazon, and Best Buy.\nThe bottom line is, this phone offers just as much as anything else you can buy in the U.S. and in most cases, it does so for a little or a lot less money. So, should you buy this phone? Yes. That's it."

      "text": "The 15 Most Powerful Smartphone Processors (Ranked By Geekbench)\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nSmartphone processors have come a long way since Apple defined the modern smartphone with 2007's iPhone. A 412-MHz Arm 11 system-on-chip (SoC) was all it needed back then, but the increasing complexity of these devices \u2014 and our deepening dependence on them \u2014 means that modern smartphones now boast the sort of processing power that we could only dream of in 2007.\nMulti-core, gigahertz-speed SoCs are now the norm, even in cheap Android smartphones. But despite the vast improvements across the board, one name still rules the roost: Apple. The company's smartphone SoCs have always had the upper hand in raw power, often two generations ahead of their non-Apple competition \u2014 which is to say that you'll see a lot of Apple SoCs on this list of the most powerful smartphone processors.\nA quick reminder before we start: We're basing this list on single-core Geekbench scores and not real-world tests. The differences between these high-end processors may not be as pronounced outside of benchmarking scenarios, and some tasks, such as social media browsing, may feel broadly similar between all of them. So before you rush out and buy an iPhone 16 Pro because its processor tops this list, take a step back and think of how you use your phone and what you need from it. With that out of the way, let's get started.\n15. Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1\nThe Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 debuted a new naming convention for Qualcomm's chips, replacing the familiar triple-digit numbering with a name that was simultaneously simpler and more complex (especially with all the variations that Qualcomm would later introduce). Qualcomm first unveiled the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in 2021, bringing improvements such as 10-gigabit 5G connectivity, an 18-bit ISP for image processing, and an updated AI engine.\nUnfortunately for Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 had some teething issues. The processor was infamous for running hot and suffering under extended testing. The end result was that Snapdragon 8 Gen 1-powered smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra we reviewed back in 2022 weren't necessarily the massive leap over the Snapdragon 888 that Qualcomm \u2014 or smartphone enthusiasts \u2014 hoped for.\nCase in point: the best Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 result in Geekbench's records is 1,580 points in single-core and 3,852 in multi-core \u2014 only a minor improvement over the Snapdragon 888's 1,510 and 3,859 points.\n14. Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1\nQualcomm has always had to play catch up to Apple, and nowhere is that more evident than with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processors. Not only did the original Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 lag behind the A13 Bionic despite coming out two years after the Apple chip, but Qualcomm's first bite suffered from heat and throttling issues that hobbled its chances of being a genuine flagship CPU.\nThings were bad enough that Qualcomm swapped manufacturers for its mid-cycle refresh, switching to TSMC for the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 and reaping the rewards with better performance, efficiency, and reduced heat output. The improvements helped push smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 that we reviewed ahead of their Snapdragon 8 Gen 1-powered predecessors.\nGranted, Geekbench scores of 1,696 and 4,352 \u2014 in single- and multi-core tests, respectively \u2014 still weren't enough to pull ahead of Apple's two-year-old A13 Bionic, let alone 2022's A16 Bionic. But the 8+ was at least a marked improvement over the original Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.\n13. Apple A13 Bionic\nAndroid smartphone processors may have improved a lot over the years, but it's a sign of Apple's dominance that a five-year-old chip still manages to place in the top 15 fastest smartphone SoCs in Geekbench's database. The A13 Bionic debuted in 2019 in the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max with a claimed 20% improvement in CPU and GPU performance over the A12 Bionic, along with better efficiency that allowed for all-day battery life.\nApple also improved its neural engine and introduced ML accelerators with the A13 Bionic, allowing for 1 trillion operations per second. Altogether, these improvements helped stretch Apple's lead over Qualcomm even further, especially considering that the Snapdragon 855 already trailed the previous A12 Bionic \u2014 a situation that we're seeing play out again with Apple's new chart-topping processors.\nA 1,729-point single-core score and a 3,895-point multi-core score admittedly isn't all that outstanding now, but it's still within spitting distance of a couple of 2024 processors.\n12. Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 \u2014 not to be confused with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 \u2014 is Qualcomm's entry into the affordable flagship market, offering a cut-down Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 experience at a suitably reduced price.\nThe 8s Gen 3 slots between the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and the Gen 3, combining the latter's CPU architecture with some of the former's technology, including the graphics hardware and memory controller. The Hexagon NPU and Sensing Hub are also more in line with the Gen 2's, although Qualcomm allegedly made some firmware updates to improve its capabilities. So this means enhanced AI features for 8s Gen 3-powered phones, but no global illumination in games, for example.\nQualcomm made some other cutbacks to get the 8s Gen 3 down to a price where it could feature in $400 phones like the Xiaomi Poco F6, but the main takeaway is that performance also takes a hit. The 8s Gen 3 scores 1,835 points in the single-core test and 4,651 in the multi-core test, so it won't set the world alight. But it's also not that much slower than Google's flagship processor, either.\n11. Google Tensor G4\nGoogle first threw its hat into the custom SoC ring in 2021, introducing the Google Tensor processor for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, before reusing it for the mid-range Pixel 6a the year after. Tensor was all about AI from the start, with Google focusing on ML capabilities such as speech recognition and camera enhancements \u2014 a focus it's maintained with the Tensor G4 from earlier this year.\nGoogle debuted the Tensor G4 alongside the Pixel 9 phones, namely the high-end Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL and the more affordable Pixel 9. None of these smartphones set the performance charts alight, admittedly, but the Gemini AI system that the Tensor G4 enables seems to have potential \u2014 potentially making up for the Tensor G4's lack of raw power.\nThis isn't to say that the Tensor G4 is slow, but 1,878 and 4,364 points in the single- and multi-core tests, respectively, isn't anything to shout about \u2014 especially not for a flagship processor from 2024.\n10. MediaTek Dimensity 9200\nThe odd one out on this list, you may not be aware of the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 if you've only ever shopped for an Apple, Samsung, or Google smartphone. MediaTek has mostly focused on the affordable flagship segment with processor families like the Dimensity 8000 series, but the Dimensity 9200 shows that it can compete with the best. Well, just about.\nLike Qualcomm's flagship processors, the Dimensity 9200 is an octa-core CPU with a ray tracing-capable GPU and an AI-accelerating NPU alongside it, making for a thoroughly modern smartphone chip. And, despite not having the same brand recognition as Samsung or Qualcomm, Dimensity 9200-powered smartphones like the Vivo X90 Pro we reviewed are solid offerings with more than adequate performance.\nThe Geekbench numbers back that up, too, with the chipset managing a 1,883 single-core score and 4,955 in the multi-core test. Nothing earth-shattering, but decent enough \u2014 if you can get your hands on one of the phones it's in, of course.\n9. Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\nQualcomm's previous flagship mobile processor is one of the better-represented ones amongst our top 15, with a variety of phones from Samsung, Vivo, Xiaomi, and OnePlus all using this octa-core CPU. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 pushed even further into AI realms, with an upgraded Hexagon NPU that improved AI performance and efficiency.\nOther upgrades included a new image signal processing (ISP) in the form of Cognitive ISP, one of the many AI enhancements the chipset would bring to flagship Android smartphones. Gamers were also treated to hardware ray tracing support, new for this generation of Snapdragon SoC. The company also improved its CPU and GPU cores' raw performance, of course.\nThe result was 1,939 points in Geekbench's single-core test and 5,341 in the multi-core test. Not too bad in the grand scheme of things \u2014 enough to maintain a place in our top 10 \u2014 but still a ways behind its successor on both fronts.\n8. Samsung Exynos 2400\nApple isn't the only smartphone company building its own processors, although it's admittedly well ahead of its rivals in the performance stakes. Leading the charge for in-house Android smartphone processors is Samsung with the Exynos 2400, the newest iteration of its long-lived family of Exynos smartphone chips.\nIf the Exynos name doesn't ring a bell, it's likely because you're in North America. Samsung uses Snapdragon chips in its Samsung Galaxy S24 and S24+ in Canada, the U.S., and China, but opts for its own Exynos processors in other regions such as Europe and Southeast Asia. The company's Exynos chips had a bad reputation in the past, but the newer Exynos chipsets seem to have ironed out the major issues and acquitted themselves well in most tests.\nThat said, the Exynos 2400 still isn't quite on par with the latest Snapdragon processor, as the Geekbench results show. 2,059 points in the single-core test and 6,253 points in multi-core isn't bad at all, mind you, but you're still giving up some performance compared to Qualcomm's best.\n7. Apple A14 Bionic\nApple's A14 Bionic powered the iPhone 12 family of phones, ranging from the base iPhone 12 up to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, with no on-paper differences between the CPU or GPU cores in any of the models. The big highlight of the A14 Bionic was the upgraded neural engine, which packed 16 cores vs. the A13 Bionic's eight cores.\nThe result was a claimed 80% increase in ML performance, all while performing an alleged 50% better than the competition. Given that Qualcomm's rival flagship of the time, the Snapdragon 865, is nowhere to be found in the top 15 as of 2024, we'd probably err on the side of agreeing with Apple's performance claims here.\nAs for the raw Geekbench numbers, the A14 Bionic scored 2,120 in the single-core and 4,956 in the multi-core tests. Roundly beaten by Qualcomm's latest SoC in the latter, then, but only a hair slower in the all-important single-core tests \u2014 all while being a good few years older, too.\n6. Qualcommm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\nThe Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is Qualcomm's most powerful SoC (at least, until the Snapdragon 8 Elite hits the market), boasting an octa-core CPU \u2014 one prime, five performance, and two efficiency cores \u2014 with its latest Adreno GPU and an updated version of the Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU) it introduced with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.\nThe company claimed a 30% CPU performance improvement over the Gen 2 with improved power efficiency. Graphics got a bump in performance, too, with 25% better performance and power efficiency. It wasn't just marketing talk, either, as independent testing showed significant improvements over the Gen 2. But the big news was the AI features, with Qualcomm claiming 98% better performance than the Gen 2 and the ability to run 20 tokens per second.\nQualcomm's latest and greatest features in a handful of high-end smartphones, most notably the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra that SlashGear editor Chris Davies reviewed (and liked). As far as Geekbench goes, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 posts its best single-core score \u2014 2,138 points \u2014 in the Samsung, while its 6,777-point multi-core high score comes in the Asus Zenfone 11 Ultra.\n5. Apple A15 Bionic\nApple's years-long domination of the Geekbench charts continued with 2021's A15 Bionic chip, which powered the company's iPhone 13 family of phones. Like its successors and predecessors \u2014 the A15 Bionic paired six cores \u2014 two high-performance cores and four efficient cores \u2014 with a powerful GPU. However, unlike later models, the A15 Bionic name encompassed both four- and five-core GPU variations.\nThe iPhone 13 and 13 Mini got the four-core GPU version of the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro Max came with a five-core GPU. The now-standard 16-core neural engine was also present, with the whole package built on a 5nm process that allowed Apple's chip designers to squeeze 15 billion transistors and a lot more cache than the previous SoC.\nAs you might expect given its age, the A15 Bionic trails Apple's latest processors in the Geekbench charts, with only 2,333 and 5,725 points in the single- and multi-core tests respectively in an iPhone 13 Pro Max.\n4. Apple A16 Bionic\nUnlike later Apple SoCs, the A16 Bionic straddled two generations of iPhone, with its six-core CPU and five-core GPU debuting initially for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max before Apple repurposed it as the entry-level chip for the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus \u2014 and doing a good job in the process, as our own Chris Davies found out when he reviewed the iPhone 15.\nApple claimed the A16 Bionic was \"generations ahead of the competition,\" touting 40% faster performance than its rivals. It's hard to disagree with the former claim: we've not seen a Qualcomm SoC on this list yet, and it's probably going to be a few more years before we see one of its processors eclipse this two-year-old (as of 2024) part.\nThe best A16 Bionic score in Geekbench's database is 2,598 for single-core and 6,677 for multi-core, both in the iPhone 14 Pro. As with the A17 Pro, scores differ ever so slightly between the different A16 Bionic-equipped smartphones, with the iPhone 15 bringing up the rear with 2,535 and 6,299 points in the single- and multi-core benchmarks, respectively.\n3. Apple A17 Pro\nThird on our list, probably unsurprisingly, is Apple's previous flagship smartphone processor, the Apple A17 Pro. The A17 Pro powered the highly-regarded iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, introducing what Apple called \"a new generation of Apple Silicon.\" The company didn't quite explain what this new generation entailed, although the A17 Pro did boast notable improvements over the A16 Bionic regardless.\nThese included 10% better CPU performance, a faster neural engine, a 20% faster six-core GPU \u2014 with hardware-accelerated ray tracing \u2014 and a dedicated AV1 decoder. But the A17 Pro wasn't just a powerful chip: it was also the first mass-market processor built on the 3nm process (courtesy of TSMC). This die shrink from the A16 Bionic's 4nm process is likely what allowed for the A17 Pro's performance and efficiency improvements.\nGeekbench shows the A17 Pro scoring 2,889 points in the single-core test and 7,170 in the multi-core test, both in an iPhone 15 Pro. For whatever reason, the 15 Pro Max's scores are slightly lower \u2014 2880 and 7136 points, respectively \u2014 although the differences are small enough to be within margin of error.\n2. Apple A18\nThe Apple A18 launched alongside the A18 Pro as the SoC in the basic Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. Like the A18 Pro, the A18 has a six-core CPU, this time complemented by a 16-core neural engine \u2014 sans the ML accelerators in the Pro \u2014 and a five-core GPU.\nApple claimed a range of performance improvements over the A16 Bionic it replaced: twice the ML capabilities, a 30% faster CPU, and a 45% faster \u2014 and 30% more efficient \u2014 GPU. Like the A18 Pro's GPU, the A18's graphics unit also supports hardware ray tracing, a feature Apple introduced with the A17 Pro.\nAs far as raw Geekbnech results go, the A18 isn't too far behind its bigger brother, a similarity that extends to the iPhone 16 more broadly. The lower-end \u2014 only relatively, of course \u2014 processor posts a 3,265-point single-core score and an 8,014-point multi-core score, both tested with an iPhone 16 Plus. That's better than the Apple M2 in the 13-inch iPad Air, which is no mean feat.\n1. Apple A18 Pro\nWe called it in the intro: The A18 Pro is Apple's latest and greatest mobile processor as of the end of 2024, powering the Apple iPhone 16 Pro \u2014 which we reviewed \u2014 and iPhone 16 Pro Max. The six-core SoC \u2014 with six-core GPU \u2014 launched as the successor to the A17 Pro chip that powered the higher-end iPhone 15 models, with Apple claiming a 15% performance improvement over the old SoC, along with a 20% improvement in power efficiency at the same performance level.\nApple also claimed that it built its new SoCs specifically for Apple Intelligence, with the A18 Pro's next-gen machine learning (ML) accelerators boosting AI efficiency and being fully optimized for features such as email summaries and call transcriptions. But we'll leave the AI discussion for another time and focus on the A18 Pro's Geekbench performance, which, as you might expect, tops the table as far as smartphones go.\nThe A18 Pro scores 3,402 points in Geekbench's single-core test and 8,401 points in the multi-core test. That's still a way behind the M-series processors in Apple's tablets and laptops (the M4 scores a crazy 13,671 in the multi-core test), but a massive improvement over the A17 Pro that preceded it, and notably higher than everything else on this list."

      "text": "How To Check Your Android Phone's Battery Health\nThe lithium-ion battery inside your Android phone has a limited life span. Every charge-discharge cycle degrades its capacity a little (because the lithium charges zipping around the battery are lost to chemical reactions). Overheating and overcharging can accelerate the process. But eventually, all available charging cycles are used up. And the battery can no longer pull or store charge.\nAlthough it's impossible to prevent, you can monitor the degradation to keep your Android's battery healthier for longer. Or, if your Android phone has a poor battery life, it's always a good troubleshooting step to check the phone's battery health. Android (by default) doesn't have such checks built into it, though.\nThere are plenty of simple workarounds to diagnose your Android phone's battery. You can punch in a dial code to test the battery life (via XDADevelopers). Alternatively, you can use a third-party app for a more reliable and detailed overview. Here are detailed instructions for each.\nHow to check your Android phone's battery health with a dial code\nBefore you head over to the Google Play Store, try dialing the code for the Android testing menu, which (among other details) includes battery information. Most phone-makers lock users out of the menu, and even when it's accessible, the relevant battery tests might not be available.\n1. Open the dialler app and punch in the following code: *#*#4636#*#*.\n2. As soon as you tap the * key, the Android Testing menu should pop up.\n3. If you see Battery Information in the menu, tap it to view the health status of your battery.\nFor many phones, dialing the code might not return anything. In that case, you'll need to download a battery app.\nIf you have a Samsung phone, the Samsung Members app features a battery health indicator (via Samsung).\n1. Download and open Samsung Members if you don't have it already.\n2. Go to Get Help > Phone care > Interactive checks > Battery.\n3. The app indicates the battery health as good or poor next to Life.\nHow to use an app to check your Android phone's battery health\nYou can also try a third-party app for a more accurate, sophisticated analysis. We recommend Battery Guru. It generates detailed charging-discharging stats and reports the battery capacity based on daily usage. Plus, it can also test devices with dual-cell phones (via Paget96). To set it up:\n1. Download and open the Battery Guru app.\n2. The app will take you through a quick setup with brief introductions of each feature.\n3. Tap the arrow button to walk through them.\n4. You might be prompted to calibrate the app towards the end. Unplug your phone if it's charging, and tap the floating Calibrate button.\n5. Find and tap the shield icon to jump to the battery health tab.\n6. A green bar and percentage indicate the current battery capacity.\nBattery Guru can only estimate the health after a few charging-discharging sessions. For the first session, charge your phone once it falls below 15% and wait for it to hit 100% on the Battery Guru dashboard. It might take longer than usual because the default battery indicator on your Android status bar isn't always accurate.\nThe app will run in the background and monitor battery usage to estimate the battery condition. For \"healthy\" sessions, the app recommends you keep the charge between 20% and 80%. But in general, you should avoid charging your Android phone to 100%."

      "text": "What Does The 'PD' In USB PD Stand For & And Why Is It Important To USB Devices?\nWith the growing number of devices that most people use today, be it smartphones, smartwatches, laptops, wireless earbuds, and other gadgets, charging them quickly and efficiently becomes important. That's exactly the problem USB PD aims to solve. But what exactly is USB PD, and what makes it so special?\nThe 'PD' in USB PD stands for Power Delivery. USB PD is a universal fast charging standard used in most modern-day smartphones, laptops, tablets, monitors, and more. This enables you to use a single charger to power a variety of devices, eliminating the need to carry different chargers.\nUSB PD was first launched back in 2012 and is currently in its third revision. The latest version can deliver up to 240W, while the older versions, namely USB PD 1.0 and 2.0, topped out at 100W. While those earlier versions worked with USB-A to USB-C cables, USB PD 3.0 requires USB-C on both ends.\nWhy is USB PD special?\nHigher power output isn't the only feature that makes USB PD special. It also supports multiple voltage levels like 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V, and enables communication between both the charger and the connected device to determine the appropriate voltage level. For instance, if a smartphone only requires 18W, the USB PD charger will only supply exactly that. Similarly, a lower power headset will only receive the power it needs. This not only reduces energy waste and prevents overheating, but also makes the charging process safer.\nAnother feature that separates USB PD from other charging technologies is its bidirectional power delivery. While older USB chargers can only deliver power from the charger to the device, USB PD allows the power to flow both to and from the device. This means that you can use a smartphone that supports USB PD to charge another device, such as a laptop.\nTo take full advantage of USB PD, you need to have a charger, a cable, and a device that all support the standard. Also, it's important to note that while USB PD is capable of delivering up to 240W of power, most smartphones max out around 45W, and laptops usually demand up to 100W of power. That said, companies like Oppo have been working on a 240W charger, so it's likely only a matter of time before the higher wattage support becomes a standard across devices."

      "text": "The Ultimate Guide To Maximizing Battery Life Across All Your Devices\nIf you glance around right now, you'll probably see multiple devices that require constant charging. The one you're reading this on is most likely one of them. Long gone are the days of single-use batteries for most devices, and instead, most of the tech you carry around is powered by a technology called lithium-ion. It's an undoubtedly convenient technology, but you probably find yourself frustrated by it on a daily basis nonetheless. Every time your phone or laptop dies before you can make it to an outlet, you're losing some of the most basic tools we use to navigate modern life.\nHowever, there are quite a few things you can do to make dead batteries a less frequent occurrence, so we've compiled some of the most effective tips. This guide is all about prioritizing battery life above all else, and that's a trade-off. Most people probably won't want to follow every tip on this list unless willing to neuter their device's functionality, so treat it more like a buffet of options to pick from. To be clear, though, none of these tips will harm your device, and all of them can easily be undone at any time. With that said, let's dive in to save you some juice.\nDim your displays\nThe display is the most power-hungry component of any device that has one, be it a laptop, tablet, smartphone, et cetera. That's because every last pixel is drawing power and refreshing constantly, like thousands of tiny light bulbs flickering faster than your eyes can perceive. Much like many light bulbs, the dimmer those pixels are, the less power they draw. For that reason, one of the best ways to maximize your battery life is to ensure that your display is never brighter than you need it to be.\nEven if your device has an automatic brightness feature that dims and brightens the display based on the ambient light around it, it may be giving you more brightness than you need. Keeping the screen manually dimmed can help, as it allows you to only increase brightness when absolutely necessary. Tangentially, where you're using the device can have an impact on the amount of brightness needed. Using it in direct sunlight will necessitate turning up the brightness to offset glare and see the display clearly.\nTurn off hardware features you're not using\nSome big sources of power drain are hardware features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, or NFC, among others. Those features directly access hardware components to function, which drains a significant amount of battery power. To help your device sip power, you'll want to turn off any such features that you don't need. For instance, if you don't have any Bluetooth devices connected, toggle it off until you need to connect those earbuds. If you're on the road, switch off your Wi-Fi until you get to a hotspot, and so forth.\nWhile some of these features consume relatively low amounts of power, the biggest one to keep an eye on is GPS. Any device equipped with location features will usually ping continuously to keep up with your whereabouts, which can heavily impact your battery life. Only turn location features back on when you're actively using a program that needs them to function, such as navigation apps.\nTurn off software features you're not using\nMost of the primary devices in your life that are battery-powered come with all sorts of features designed to speed up performance, enhance your user experience, or just add some fun bells and whistles. But plenty of those features also drain battery life, most of all the ones related to boosting speeds. For example, gaming laptops often have modes that overclock the CPU and GPU to ensure the best performance in games, but enabling those settings will cause your battery to drain faster than a kid's Halloween candy stash.\nIf possible, on your device, enable settings that only boost performance when you're plugged into a power source and turn them off when you unplug, as can be found baked into modern Windows and MacOS laptops. On phones and tablets, you'll have to be more judicious, as neither Android nor iOS have explicit settings to switch between plugged-in and unplugged modes. However, modern mobile OSes do take your charging status into account in some instances. For example, they'll wait until you're connected to power before automatically updating your installed apps.\nOn all other devices, your mileage may vary, and you'll probably have to manually disable power-hungry software features. What those are will differ from product to product, so consult your owner's manual or online documentation.\nClose programs or apps you're not using\nEvery program or application running on your device is consuming power, even if you don't have it in the foreground. Therefore, to maximize your battery life, any program or app that doesn't have a use case for being open should not be running.\nOn Windows PCs and Macs, this is especially true. Just because you closed a window doesn't mean the application stopped running. On Windows, check the system tray represented by the small up arrow near the bottom right of the taskbar. There, you'll see icons representing your background programs. Most of them have an option to fully exit after right-clicking an icon. For Mac users, head to the Activity Monitor.\nThe situation is a bit more opaque on smartphones, but some specific apps drain the battery on Android, and the culprits are similar on iPhone. Clearing out your recently used apps from the app switcher will close the bulk of running apps on both iOS and Android. Some Android phones, such as Samsung Galaxy devices running recent versions of One UI, will also alert you to other apps running in the background from the App Switcher. Closing all of those is usually the best you can do.\nTake advantage of power-saving settings\nMost modern devices come stocked with features specifically meant to help preserve your battery life. These can take many forms, from those that try to rein in power-hungry apps and programs to those that kick in when your device is unplugged or low on power. If your goal is to prioritize your battery life, these are among the first things you should enable.\nOn smartphones, both iOS and Android have a suite of power-saving features. For Android, you'll find these in the Device Care section of Settings, while on iOS, they can be found in the Battery section of Settings. In both cases, you'll find features that seek to restrict apps, dim the screen, and reduce power consumption from processing.\nOn Windows 10 and 11, such features can be found in the Settings app under System > Power & battery, where you'll find power mode settings that let you balance processing power with battery life, as well as a Battery saver mode. Lastly, on MacOS, you can find similar options by clicking the Apple menu and navigating to System Settings, then Battery.\nKeep power draining apps at bay\nApplications are the primary way we interact with our smart devices, and, of course, they also consume the most power. Some are more power-hungry than others \u2014 for instance, video streaming and web browsing are easy ways to gobble up battery \u2014 but in general, battery life is a resource you spend to run apps, a truth that holds equally whether we're talking about laptops, tablets, phones, or anything else capable of running software. And opened programs will often continue running in the background, even once you think you've closed them. In some cases, they'll run before you've even opened them.\nOn laptops, this can cause the most battery drain. On both Windows and MacOS, the operating system will load up a list of apps every time you boot up the machine, and apps often have this behavior enabled by default. On Windows 11, disable Startup apps you don't need to have running at all times. You can find the list of Startup apps and toggles to disable them in the Apps section of your Settings app under the Startup submenu. On MacOS, these are referred to as Login Items, and you can disable them from the General section of System Settings under Login Items.\nOn smartphones and tablets, both iOS and Android have smart app management designed to keep power-hungry apps at bay, but Android does give you more granular control. On both operating systems, you can see which apps are draining the most battery from the Battery section of the Settings app, then deal with them accordingly.\nTurn down graphics settings\nMany modern devices, be they smartphones, laptops, tablets, or what have you, come equipped with high-resolution, high-refresh-rate displays. 4K displays have become fairly commonplace, as have 120Hz displays. These features are great when you're close to a charger, but if you're trying to get the most out of your battery, you may want to dial them back.\nMost devices have the option to run the display at a lower resolution and refresh rate than they're capable of. (iPhones are a major caveat here; Apple wants you to use their default settings and gives you no other option.) If your goal is to prioritize battery life, consider turning down the resolution to 1080p and capping the refresh rate at 60Hz.\nAs these technologies become more commonplace, manufacturers are learning to make them more efficient, so your mileage may vary here. You might see a significant increase in battery life by adjusting these settings or a more minimal one.\nDon't leave your device plugged in at full battery\nYou may have heard that charging your battery all the way to 100% is bad for it, but that's a bit of a misconception. Charging your battery to 100% isn't, in and of itself, bad for the battery. The problem occurs when you charge to full and then don't unplug the device. This puts strain on the delicate chemistry of the battery because, as you leave your device on the charger, it uses power for its normal operations and sucks up more from the electricity source. That constant small dip and recharge can reduce the battery's health over time because you're constantly moving the ions inside back and forth.\nIn other words, stop leaving your devices plugged in to charge overnight. If you instead charge up before bed, unplug, and then top off in the morning, your devices will thank you later. However, most manufacturers have put in certain fail-safes like trickle-charge mechanisms over the last handful of years, in addition to other smart software features meant to help preserve battery health. So, avoid leaving your devices plugged in for too long, but rest assured, it's not the end of the world if you occasionally forget to pull the plug.\nDon't let your battery drain completely\nLithium-ion batteries contain a delicate chemical ecosystem of ions, and, like charging to full for extended periods of time, letting your battery hit zero also strains it over time. That's because when your battery is empty, it takes more effort to get the ions inside moving again. If you want great battery life from your device years down the road, keep your battery charged over 20% to the best of your ability.\nAgain, letting it get completely empty isn't usually the end of the world. No manufacturer puts out a rechargeable device expecting it never to die, and even when it's technically zeroed out and the thing powers off, there's still technically a bit of juice left over \u2014 kind of like how your car's gas meter will read empty a few miles before the engine actually sputters out. Moreover, 20% is a bit of an arbitrary number, but that last 20% drains faster, so it's a good point of reference.\nOf course, if you're using some of the other tips in this article, your battery should be dying on you with significantly less frequency, so you should find yourself with ample opportunity to charge up before hitting 20%.\nStore your device properly and regulate its temperature\nBatteries are touchy things, and nothing is worse for them than extreme temperatures. In extreme cold, the internal resistance of the battery increases, making it harder to carry a charge. Extreme heat is far worse and can even be dangerous, as it causes a phenomenon called thermal runaway, in which a series of chemical reactions occur in the battery.\nNot only will this severely degrade the battery, but it can even cause it to catch on fire or explode. (If ever you see your device appearing to swell up, keep it away from people and pets, do not continue to use it, and do not attempt to charge it.)\nTo keep your batteries functioning efficiently in the long run, store your device in a cool (but not extremely cold) area, do not expose it to direct sun or extreme cold for more than a few minutes, and make sure there's airflow to any cooling vents. In other words, do not leave it sitting poolside on a hot summer day or in your car during a snowstorm."

      "text": "Do The Apps Running In The Background On Your Phone Drain Your Battery Faster?\nSmartphones have come a long way in the level of convenience they have to offer. You have several instant messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger that let you connect with your loved ones over the internet. Then there's the recent surge of AI-assisted features with nearly every phone release, offering features like smart object removal, accurate transcriptions, and even a way to screen and manage incoming calls for you.\nOur phones are also constantly managing and relaying information back to us in the form of notifications. Somebody texts you on iMessage? You instantly get a notification on your iPhone. This is extremely convenient, and honestly, taken it a bit for granted given that the alternative would've been to always leave an app open.\nBackground app activity is also what allows you to upload large files on Google Drive and switch to another app without pausing or canceling the upload. With the bucketload of notifications your phone receives, it's safe to assume that the majority of the apps on your device have access to background data \u2014 but in what capacity? Do all apps drain the same amount of battery when not in active use? Recent versions of Android and iOS make it quite easy to view and manage the apps that run in the background \u2014 and here's how you can optimize your phone to stretch its battery life.\nManaging background apps on Android\nAndroid largely divides battery consumption based on three states of an app \u2014 foreground app when in use, foreground service that isn't visible, and background parts of an app. Phones running Android 13 and newer are equipped with a power consumption tracker that monitors and alerts users if any foreground or background service has been consuming more battery than usual.\nPhones running a vanilla Android experience, like Pixel or Motorola devices, will let you view a list of running apps when you pull down to access the quick controls. Here, you can view how long each app in the background has been running for, and stop it with a single tap. You can also view the amount of battery the apps you use have been consuming by navigating to Settings > Battery > Battery Usage. Note that the exact menu names will vary slightly depending on your phone's manufacturer and model.\nIf you find a service that has been eating way too much of your phone's battery even when not in active use, you can manually revoke an app's access to background usage on Android.\n- On your Android phone, launch the Settings app.\n- Navigate to Apps > See all apps, and select the one that has been draining your phone's battery.\n- Tap on \"App battery usage\" and uncheck the \"Allow background usage\" toggle.\nNote that certain services like messaging apps require background activity to function properly and send you notifications in real time.\nManaging background apps on iOS\niPhones have generally had a better reputation over the years when it comes to battery management and app performance \u2014 but they aren't immune to bad actors that may use excess resources in the background. Unlike Android, iOS doesn't notify its users if an app has been consuming more battery than necessary \u2014 but that's not to say that the operating system doesn't have preventive measures in place.\nBackground services on iOS noticeably run more strictly \u2014 which is why you may sometimes get the \"open app to finish upload\" notification. To view battery consumption on your iPhone or iPad, navigate to Settings > Battery, and scroll down to view a list of apps that have consumed most of your device's battery life in the previous 24 hours. You can also view the amount of time an app has spent in the background and your iPhone's battery health.\nIf you find a culprit that has been draining way more juice than it needs to, chances are that it has been consuming a lot of resources in the background.\n- On your iPhone, launch the Settings app.\n- Navigate to Apps and select the one that has been causing you battery issues.\n- Tap the \"Background App Refresh\" toggle to turn it off.\nOnce again, this will stop the app from updating information in the background, which isn't ideal if you heavily depend on real-time updates from a service, like navigation or location sharing."
