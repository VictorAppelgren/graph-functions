  "content": "CNN host Abby Phillip compared President Donald Trump to Batman on Monday night while criticizing his efforts to clean up crime in Washington, D.C. However, social media users thought the comparison made Trump look \"cool.\"\n\nDuring the intro to CNN's \"NewsNight,\" Phillip mocked Trump as the \"crime-fighter-in-chief\" of the nation's capital and compared him to the comic book character after the president's announcement earlier in the day that the federal government would be cleaning up crime in the city.\n\n\"Donald Trump makes himself Batman and the nation\u2019s capital is Gotham City,\" she said, adding, \"The President of the United States has declared himself crime-fighter-in-chief, and he\u2019s taking over Washington\u2019s police force.\"\n\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\n\nConservative commentator Steve Guest wrote, \"That makes President Trump sound SUPER COOL! Don't think that was Abby's intention at all.\"\n\nTrump said on Monday he would federalize the D.C. police department and place it under the authority of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an effort to address crime. According to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the president can place the city's police department under federal control for up to 30 days.\n\nTrump also said he was activating approximately 800 National Guard troops to \"reestablish law, order and public safety\" in the capital.\n\nFBI DIRECTOR KASH PATEL BACKS TRUMP'S DC POLICE TAKEOVER: 'WHEN YOU LET GOOD COPS BE COPS, THEY DELIVER'\n\nIn the CNN segment, Phillip noted D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser calling Trump\u2019s move to federalize the district\u2019s police force \"unsettling and unprecedented.\"\n\nIn a Monday press conference, the mayor said, \"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised. I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"\n\nOther X users got a kick out of the CNN anchor calling Trump \"Batman.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nThe official X account for media watchdog org Newsbusters posted, \"Does she know that makes him sound awesome?\"\n\nPopular conservative account Libs Of TikTok replied to Phillip\u2019s video, stating, \"I already voted for him!

      "text": "FBI Director Kash Patel endorsed President Donald Trump's plans to take over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington D.C., amid heavy criticism from Democrats and local officials who say the move is part of a power grab.\nPatel was seen Monday afternoon inside a command post for the first night of the temporary takeover in a show of support for law enforcement.\n\"Proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the men and women who keep our nation\u2019s capital safe,\" Patel said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital. \"When you let good cops be cops, give them the tools they need, and back them every step of the way, they deliver - every time.\"\nIn photos exclusively provided to Fox News Digital, Patel can be seen speaking Monday to FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel wearing protective vests at a command center at a U.S. Park Police station.\nOn Monday, Trump said he would federalize the police department and place it under the authority of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an effort to address crime. He also said he was activating approximately 800 National Guard troops to \"reestablish law, order and public safety\" in the capital.\nWashington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move \"unsettling and unprecedented.\"\n\"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\" Bowser said during a news conference. \"I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\nThe District of Columbia Home Rule Act allows Trump to place the city's police department under federal control for up to 30 days. Bowser noted that granting D.C. statehood, an issue local officials have repeatedly advocated for, could have prevented the takeover.\n\"If people are concerned about the president being able to move the National Guard into our city, the time to do that would have been when the Congress had a bill that it could have given control of the D.C. National Guard to D.C.,\" she said. \"So there are things that, when a city is not a state, and not fully autonomous, and doesn\u2019t have senators, that the federal government can do.\"\nOther Democrats heavily criticized the Trump administration for the move.\n\"If President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our work to drive down crime and violence,\" the office of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said. \"Sending in the national guard would only serve to destabilize our city and undermine our public safety efforts.\"\nThe Washington, D.C. City Council called the temporary takeover a \"manufactured intrusion on local authority.\"\nTRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE\n\"Violent crime in the District is at the lowest rates we\u2019ve seen in 30 years. Federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency,\" the council said in a joint statement. \"Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard\u2019s role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission.\"\nThe National Capital Region Delegation, a body comprised of several House Democratic lawmakers, accused Trump of personally inciting crime in the capital, referring to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol building.\n\"Trump\u2019s \u2018temporary\u2019 takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is not intended to prevent crime, it is a soft launch of authoritarianism,\" the group said in a statement. \"Trump has a longstanding pattern of seeking showy displays of power. As he has shown repeatedly, Trump is working to serve himself and is not concerned with keeping American families safe in cities and towns across our country.\"\n\"The President\u2019s announcement this morning is an unserious and unacceptable publicity stunt,\" they added. \"If he wants to reduce crime in the District of Columbia, he should focus on getting his Republican allies in Congress to restore the funding they arbitrarily stripped out of the city\u2019s budget, which risks cuts to law enforcement and other public safety measures.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, called Trump's announcement a \"gross overreach, disconnected from actual conditions on the ground.\"\n\"So, we have to ask: Will the president\u2019s heavy-handed show of force make the average D.C. resident feel safer? Will it create jobs for working people and bring patrons back to downtown businesses?\" she said. \"Will it provide young people a pathway to jobs, skills or other activities that keep them off the streets?\"\n\"The answer to those questions is \u2018no,\u2019 she added. \"That\u2019s why this move is yet another crass spectacle from a president who cares more about targeting, intimidating and playing king than the safety of D.C. and its residents.\"\nTrump's opponents have cited crime statistics showing crime in Washington is on the decline. Crime in Washington is down 26% this year compared to the same timeframe in 2024, according to the MPD. Assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%, according to police data. In January, the Justice Department said violent crime in 2024 in the district was down 35% from 2023, the lowest it has been in over 30 years.\nHowever, Trump disagrees.\nMetropolitan Police Department data shows that while the homicide rate is falling, the last five years saw the greatest number of murders since 2008.\n\"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,\" Trump said Monday. \"This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse.\"\nFox News Digital's Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report."

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

Raichik has emerged as one of social media\u2019s most influential conservatives by reposting far-left content to put a spotlight on what she considers over-the-top, extreme liberal ideology that often has to do with LGBTQ causes and education.\nAlong the way, Raichik has been the subject of critical pieces from legacy news organizations and is regularly labeled transphobic by online critics.\n\"I think that you can judge a lot about a person by their enemies, and the people that attack me constantly, call me names and slurs, and write hit pieces on me. These are the people that are pro-genital mutilation of children. They want porn in schools. They want grown men to dress half naked and shake their body parts in front of children,\" Raichik told Fox News Digital.\n'LIBS OF TIKTOK' CREATOR APPOINTED TO OKLAHOMA LIBRARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE\n\"I would actually be very concerned if they liked me,\" she continued. \"So, I'm glad that they attack me.\"\nRaichik said she was never particularly interested in politics, and didn\u2019t use social media until she was out of work during the COVID-19 pandemic and found herself with extra time on her hands. She began exploring TikTok and was entertained by liberals who used the platform.\n\"I was like, \u2018OK, these are funny, and I'm going to share them with the rest of the world.\u2019 So, originally it started just COVID-related TikToks. I would just find people, you know, like praising, Dr. Fauci, singing about masks and vaccines, throwing toddlers off of planes for not wearing masks, having meltdowns over COVID,\" she said.\nRaichik had no idea she was on a path to internet stardom.\n\"Once I was on TikTok, I came across the whole other section, which was all of the groomers, the activist teachers, the doctors, the mental health professionals pushing gender ideology and what they call gender-affirming care,\" she said.\n\"Of course, there was also a lot of anti-American sentiments and anti-White racism. And I just felt like people had to know what was going on,\" Raichik continued. \"I started sharing those, and then the account just exploded.\"\nAs for the @LibsofTikTok handle, Raichik said she didn\u2019t think about it too much.\n\"I saw these videos and it was libs, right? Like liberals\u2026 basically I was only posting TikToks. Now I post other content, too, but it started out with just TikToks, and it just came to me\u2026 I didn't really think too deeply into it. I was just like, \u2018Oh, these are libs' TikToks. Libs of TikTok,\u2019\" she said.\n\"That\u2019s how it was born,\" Raichik said, noting that she doesn\u2019t limit herself to repurposing TikTok content.\n\"It is anything to expose the radical left and gender ideology and wokeness and all that stuff,\" she said.\nRaichik has received death threats, been slapped with X's Community Notes, suspended from platforms and was famously doxxed by Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz after attempting to remain anonymous. She admits she probably wouldn\u2019t have chosen to reveal her identity if it was up to her, but now that her name is public, she\u2019s trying to embrace it to \"continue the mission.\"\n\"The goal is to really stop the sexualization of children and to expose the radical left. So, now I can do that as a public figure,\" she said.\nRaichik now creates content full-time on social media and Substack and has assembled a \"small, incredible staff.\" Earlier this year, she was appointed to the Oklahoma State Department of Education\u2019s (OSDE) Library Media Advisory Committee (LMAC).\n\"We are just always looking for any kind of groomers and predators and hypocrisy and lies from the Left to expose,\" she said.\n'LIBS OF TIKTOK' CREATOR, CHAYA RAICHIK, NOW HELPING FAMILIES TO 'SPOT PREDATORY BEHAVIOR'\nRaichik believes social media is critical for the fight against far-left ideology and said the types of issues she has exposed flew under the radar for decades before independent journalists were able to put a spotlight on them using platforms such as X. But while most social media influencers crave the attention that comes with millions of followers, Raichik hopes she\u2019s able to eventually \"become irrelevant.\"\n\"When gender ideology is eradicated from our society, then I won't have any more content and I'll happily shut down,\" Raichik said.\n\"I don't anticipate that happening anytime soon because the Left are so insane,\" she added. \"I started this because there was a need, and if there's no need anymore, then I will happily stop.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital\u2019s Joshua Q.

      "text": "President Donald Trump shared new details on Monday about his plan to take control of public safety in Washington, D.C., following a brutal attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, but D.C. residents aren't convinced.\nTrump announced on Monday that he is activating the District of Columbia National Guard and seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department after floating the idea since last week's assault in Washington\u2019s Logan Circle.\nSome Washington residents who spoke to Fox News Digital called it a \"terrible idea\" that \"doesn't make a lot of sense.\"\n\"I think D.C. politics should stay with D.C., and, unfortunately, the federal government is apparently overstepping their bounds right now, so I hope that D.C. is allowed to govern itself, as well as police itself,\" one Washington resident told Fox News Digital ahead of Trump's announcement.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nTrump controversially federalized the California National Guard amid anti-ICE protests that delved into riots in Los Angeles in June. Protesters were rejecting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations and Trump's robust immigration crackdown.\nThe president bypassed Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy National Guard troops to support ICE deportation. It was the first time a president federalized the National Guard without the governor's request in more than 60 years.\nNow, the tension between local and federal powers is unfolding in the nation's capital. But just like in California, many Washington residents have concerns about seeing \"troops on our streets.\"\n\"We have laws for a reason,\" one resident told Fox News Digital.\n\"Privatizing security is a terrible idea, and I think anything that Trump does is garbage,\" another Washington resident added.\nDespite their apprehension about National Guard troops patrolling the nation's capital, many residents said something needs to be done to address crime in Washington, D.C.\nWhile the Department of Justice indicated a 30-year low in violent crime last year, concerns about the city's safety linger, with one resident telling Fox News Digital, \"The city is getting dangerous.\"\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" one resident said of Trump's new plan. \"It's something that needs to be done for the city to be safe. Right now, we're not safe. The kids and the teenagers are doing everything. So yeah, I think that's a great idea.\"\nAnd another Washington resident said, \"We need all the protection that we can get in the city, because the city is really getting dangerous,\" telling Fox News Digital that she has to \"make sure to come home before sundown\" and she is afraid of getting robbed when she gets off public transportation.\n\"Things do seem out of control and desperate, but I don't know what kind of numbers to take, what numbers to read. One minute they'll say crime is out of control. Next minute, they will say crime is down a certain percentage. It's kind of confusing, and I don't know who to believe in and which way to go, to be honest,\" a Washington resident said, articulating the dichotomy between the low crime statistics and the alarming crime stories.\nBut another D.C. resident said, \"There's no way he should be in control of anything,\" and Washington, D.C., \"should be a state,\" so the district has more power to make decisions for itself.\n\"I don't think it's necessary,\" another Washington resident added. \"I do think there needs to be some change within [the] Metropolitan [Police Department] because safety is an issue.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe added: \"It needs to be localized.\"\nFox News Digital's Diana Stacy contributed to this report."
