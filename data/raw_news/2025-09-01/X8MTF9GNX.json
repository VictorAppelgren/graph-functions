  "description": "An 11-year-old boy has died after being shot while playing a doorbell ditch prank in Houston on Saturday night, police said.",
  "content": "An 11-year-old boy has died after being shot while playing a doorbell ditch prank in Houston on Saturday night, police said.\n\nThe boy and several other kids were ringing doorbells and running from multiple homes in an east Houston neighborhood, according to CNN affiliate KHOU. As the boy ran from a house on Racine Street just before 11 p.m., someone chased after him and shot him in the back, according to KHOU.\n\nThe boy was transported to hospital and was pronounced dead on Sunday, according to police.\n\nOne person was detained at the scene for questioning and has since been released, police said. Investigators are reviewing surveillance video and working with the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office on possible charges, KHOU reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll more than likely be a murder charge,\u201d Sgt. Michael Cass, a homicide detective with the Houston Police Department, told KHOU, noting the boy\u2019s death does not appear to involve self-defense because the shooting \u201cwasn\u2019t close to the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cDing dong ditching\u201d is an age-old prank that\u2019s risen in popularity in recent years as a social media challenge. TikTok videos often feature variations where pranksters pound on or kick people\u2019s front doors.\n\nIn a Dallas suburb at the end of July, a man fired multiple shots into a fleeing car after someone banged on his door, according to police. The man was arrested on charges of aggravated assault.\n\nSome \u201cding dong ditch\u201d pranks have turned deadly in the past.\n\nIn May, an 18-year-old high school senior in Virginia was shot and killed while filming a \u201cding dong ditch\u201d to post on TikTok, The New York Times reported. The man accused of shooting the teen was charged with second-degree murder.\n\nIn 2020, three 16-year-olds were killed when a man rammed his car into their vehicle in retaliation for pulling a \u201cding dong ditch\u201d prank on him. The man was convicted of three counts of murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 2023.\n\nAuthorities across the country have raised concerns about the door knock challenge, warning of both the potential danger and legal consequences for those involved.\n\n\u201cThink it\u2019s funny to bang on doors and run? Think again,\u201d the Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Indiana wrote in a Facebook post in August. \u201cWhat might seem like a prank can lead to serious legal trouble, property damage, or worse \u2013 someone getting hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to end up dead, especially in Florida,\u201d Sheriff Mike Chitwood of Florida\u2019s Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office told CNN affiliate WESH in July, after arresting a 13-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy for kicking a local resident\u2019s door one night.\n\nThe teens were captured on a doorbell camera creeping up to a family\u2019s home and kicking the door before running away, WESH reported. Authorities took two hours to find them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re endangering your future with this TikTok challenge,\u201d Chitwood said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be charged with a felony.\u201d The two teens were charged with burglary, according to WESH.",

      "text": "The California man accused of intentionally driving his car into another car, killing three teen boys, did so in retaliation after the boys ding-dong ditched his home, the Riverside County District Attorney\u2019s Office said.\nAnurag Chandra, 42, faces three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder for the accident, which occurred in southern California earlier this week. Now, the district attorney\u2019s office is seeking a special circumstance allegation of multiple murders.\nUnder California state law, if Chandra is found guilty of first-degree murder and one of several \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d about the crime are proven, he could be eligible for life in prison without parole or the death penalty, though capital punishment was suspended in the state in 2019.\nSix teenage boys were having a sleepover in Chandra\u2019s Temescal Valley neighborhood, and one of them was dared to ring Chandra\u2019s doorbell, the Riverside County District Attorney\u2019s Office said. One of the boys rang his doorbell and darted back into the group\u2019s Toyota Prius, the office said.\nChandra allegedly got in his Infiniti Q50, and chased after the teens\u2019 car. He rammed into the back of the Prius and sent it veering off the road and into a tree, the district attorney\u2019s office said.\nDaniel Hawkins, Jacob Ivascu and Drake Ruiz, all 16, were killed. The 18-year-old driver and two passengers, ages 13 and 14, were injured but survived.\nVictims\u2019 families told CNN affiliate KCAL that the boys didn\u2019t know Chandra before they rang his doorbell.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just beyond what someone\u2019s reaction should be to someone ringing your doorbell and running away,\u201d district attorney\u2019s office spokesman John Hall said.\nChandra was arrested in his home and booked at a Riverside detention center. He\u2019ll be arraigned next month.\nIt\u2019s not clear at this time if Chandra has an attorney. The Riverside County Public Defender\u2019s Office has not responded to CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment.\nThe injured boys\u2019 brothers died in the crash\nKCAL reported that the six teens were celebrating Jacob\u2019s birthday on the night of the incident. The two younger boys who were injured were the brothers of two of the boys who died.\n\u201cJacob was the eldest of five kids, and he was the third mother-father figure, so we\u2019re all devastated,\u201d Alex Ivascu, Jacob\u2019s father, told KCAL.\nDebbie Ruiz, Drake\u2019s mother, called her son a \u201cclass clown.\u201d\n\u201cJoy and happiness were his main priorities in life,\u201d she told KCAL. \u201cWe had a lot of fun together.\u201d"
