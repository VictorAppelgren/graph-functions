      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid foundation but requires enhancements in several areas to achieve world-class quality. First, deepen the causal chain by explicitly linking how inflation and employment data influence Fed policy decisions and market reactions, using specific examples from the source material. Clarify the alignment with the multi-year horizon by discussing potential long-term impacts of current policies and economic conditions on market structures. Ensure adherence to the specified length and format constraints by tightening the prose and avoiding redundancy. Incorporate quantifiable data, such as specific inflation rates and employment figures, to support claims and avoid generic statements. Increase citation density by integrating more direct references to the source material, ensuring all critical sources are covered and conflicts reconciled. Finally, articulate key risks and catalysts with greater specificity, including potential scenarios for inflation persistence and labor market recovery, to enhance the analysis's robustness and clarity.",
