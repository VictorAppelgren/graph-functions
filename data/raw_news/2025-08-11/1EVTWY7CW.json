  "content": "Sorry, Wenclair fans, it may be time to throw in the towel.\n\nMany fans of Netflix's hit series Wednesday like to imagine a blossoming romance between the main character, Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega), and her Nevermore Academy roommate, the optimistic and bubbly werewolf Enid Sinclair (Emma Myers). However, a new interview with the show's creators may have put an end to the popular femslash ship.\n\nAlfred Gough and Miles Millar if they thought a romance between the two female best friends would ever happen on screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a show about female friendship, and people can read into it whatever they want, which is great.

      "text": "Director Tim Burton and star Jenna Ortega recently sat down with The Hollywood Reporter for an interview about the highly anticipated season season of the Netflix show, Wednesday, as well as news that the Netflix series would be getting a third season.\nDuring their chat, the director and star traded quotes about what fans can expect from the second season, Ortega discussing the controversy she found herself at the center of during press for Wednesday season 1, and the potential for a third Beetlejuice movie.\nBurton told THR that he was excited to continue the story because he doesn't typically do television. \"It was the idea of exploring something on a longer time frame, and she\u2019s an interesting character,\" he said. \"As much as a middle-aged man could feel like a teenage Wednesday Addams, I feel those things. And she\u2019s a character that\u2019s all about being subtle because she doesn\u2019t really have a huge range of emotions.\"\nOrtega agreed, and the conversation continued to discuss her accidental controversy in which she discussed \"changing lines\" and \"had to put [her] foot down\" because \"everything [she] had to play did not make sense for the character.\" Looking back, she said she felt terrible about the way her words came across. \"In no way did I mean to come across that way. I spend a lot of time in my head, and I have all these different trains of thought, and all I needed to say was, 'I improvise.' Also, nobody, before, ever cared what I said. It was a good lesson.\" The showrunner added that Ortega is now a producer on the show and has more creative control.\nThe interviewer also mentioned the news from Warner Bros. Pictures co-chairman/CEO Mike De Luca stating that development for Beetlejuice 3 was \"starting imminently.\" Neither Ortega nor Burton seemed to know what the interviewer was talking about. \"Really? Nobody told me. Maybe I've been replaced,\" Burton said. \"Maybe I've been, too. Maybe [her character] Astrid dies and goes to heaven instead [of the films' Netherworld]. They should just take Baby Beetlejuice on tour and send him to Hawaii,\" Ortega joined in to say.\nBurton said the sequel took 35 years to make, so he'd be 105 before the next movie got made. \"It's like trying to re-create the Wednesday dance scene,\" Burton added, noting that he'd love to make a third movie but had reservations. \"I love the characters, but I don't necessarily see it.\"\nSeason 2 of Netflix's Wednesday will arrive to the streaming service in two parts: Part one on August 6 and part two on September 3."

      "text": "Sorry, Wednesday and Enid fans, it\u2019s not happening and most likely never will.\nWhile there are plenty of fans who tune into Netflix\u2018s Wednesday in hopes that Jenna Ortega\u2018s titular character and her mismatched Nevermore Academy roommate, Enid Sinclair (Emma Myers), will one day see the light and realize they love each other, series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar say that is not in the cards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a show about female friendship and people can read into it whatever they want, which is great. I mean, that\u2019s the beauty of television, is people can take ownership, but they\u2019re very much friends,\u201d Gough said when asked if they might ever explore a romance between the fan-favorite characters. \u201cIt\u2019s really a show exploring that female friendship.\u201d\nOn TikTok, one can throw a stone and find an edit or fan art devoted to \u201cWenclair,\u201d the ship name of the two characters, with some videos racking up millions of likes from hopeful viewers. It\u2019s become so ubiquitous online, in fact, that Ortega and Myers have personally fielded questions about their characters\u2019 sexuality and relationship to the LGBTQ+ community.\nAdding onto what Gough said, Millar told DECIDER that they\u2019ve always set out to center Wednesday and Enid around \u201cthe idea of sisterhood and what that means,\u201d and that while it may not be romantic in nature, it is something special that these diametrically opposed teens would find a deep connection in each other\u2019s presence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that they\u2019ve been embraced in that way. I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s very special, unique about that,\u201d Millar said. \u201cYou have a show that is about, at its core, these two teenage girls who need each other and have found that connection. And they\u2019re very, very different.\u201d\nAs for what comes next for Wednesday after the Season 2 Part 1 cliffhanger and the importance of keeping Wednesday and Enid\u2019s friendship at the heart of the show, keep reading for DECIDER\u2019s full interview with Gough and Millar.\nDECIDER: I want to start by asking about the timeline from Season 1 to Season 2. There\u2019s been a lot of backlash over the three-year wait. What is your response to those critics?\nALFRED GOUGH: Well, the Season 2 timeline, unfortunately, was out of our control. There was a writers\u2019 strike, we moved the show from Romania to Ireland, so there were other factors. Because, believe me, we didn\u2019t want the show off the air that long either. And Season 3 will definitely be coming faster than Season 2.\nDo you have a pie-in-the-sky timeline for Season 3?\nGOUGH: At this point, I don\u2019t think we know what day it is, so I couldn\u2019t tell you.\nMILES MILLAR: Obviously, we want it sooner than three years. The show is very difficult to make. I know it sounds like we only have eight episodes, but each episode is like a movie in terms of \u2014 we have over 3000 visual effects shots, it takes us nine months to shoot the show. So it is a big show. It\u2019s like a BMF in terms of getting the show made. And we have incredibly high standards in terms of visual effects and all those sorts of elements that go into making a great show. But yeah, we share everyone\u2019s frustrations in terms of the time it\u2019s taken to get back on the air. But the aim is for Season 2 to come much faster. That\u2019s definitely our goal.\nThe fans are going to be so happy to hear that. I do want to talk about the pacing a little bit, because we only got the first four episodes, and that really leaves off on a cliffhanger. Where do we go from here for Season 2 Part 2?\nGOUGH: There was talk about dividing the season early on. And for us, it was the ability to kind of change up the mystery storytelling. You know, we told the cards down whodunit in Season 1. And we didn\u2019t want to repeat ourselves that way. We wanted to have a mystery, but then we wanted to have this mystery kind of resolve itself, but then open the door to a ton more questions, which will then propel us into Part 2.\nWhen you sat down to start to break out the season, how difficult was it for you guys to find the balance between the Wednesday and Enid stuff, the mystery, the high school drama?\nMILLAR: That is the balance of the show. It\u2019s like the cake mix you want because the show has lots of things. It\u2019s definitely a murder mystery, it\u2019s a family drama with the Addams, it\u2019s really about female friendship with Enid and Wednesday and then throwing Agnes into that as well. We have the teen romance with Enid and Bruno and Ajax and Bianca. We have Bianca\u2019s story with her mum. So there are all these elements and tone as well. The show can be super serious and sort of earnest with the love story with the kids or it can be pretty dark and gory with Slurp and his antics as a brain-eating zombie. And then we have the drama with Morticia and Wednesday, but what we love about it is it is that tonal mix, that it is this sort of like grand soup of tone and audiences seem to embrace it.\nMILLAR: And also, at its heart, we always say it\u2019s a comedy, so you should hopefully be laughing, as you go, to Wednesday\u2019s zingers and sort of physical comedy of Ajax stoning the kids during prank day and things like that. So it\u2019s really this great mix of tone and juggling act.\nWhen we talk about physicality, we cannot overlook Jenna\u2019s performance as Wednesday. She\u2019s been nominated for all these awards but can we just give her her flowers for coming right back for Season 2?\nMILLAR: Completely. She came in, Season 1, owned it. And she slipped right back into this character like she was possessed this season. She is so incredible in this role. It was the role she was born to play; she is Wednesday, you know? We always talked to Tim about finding Wednesday, [it] was going to be the make-or-break of the show. We literally found the perfect Wednesday. Jenna just brings so much to every single frame, every single shot, every single expression. It\u2019s really magic on screen. And I think she can do so much for so little. We are so lucky to have her and so thrilled. I think people are going to love her this season.\nYou mentioned Tim, I think fans are going to lose their minds at the very-Burton animation in Episode 1. How did that come into the mix this season?\nGOUGH: We had the story of the Skull Tree in the script and we sort of initially wrote it, you know, just as a regular flashback. And then we realized it was an opportunity, like, if we\u2019re ever going to take a swing now with stop motion, which takes a long time and is not cheap, this would be the time to do it. So we just wrote it in the draft, we didn\u2019t tell anybody, we just wrote it in. And then, everybody read it and loved it. Tim fell in love with it and we worked with Mackinnon and Saunders, who did Corpse Bride and have worked with Tim in the past, and Tim designed all of the characters. So it was amazing.\nI want to ask about the Wednesday and Enid connection. This show has so many queer fans and they see themselves represented in their relationship, is there a world in which you guys would explore that type of dynamic?\nGOUGH: It\u2019s a show about female friendship and people can read into it whatever they want, which is great. I mean, that\u2019s the beauty of television, is people can take ownership, but they\u2019re very much friends. And it\u2019s really a show exploring that female friendship.\nMILLAR: And the idea of sisterhood and what that means. It\u2019s amazing that they\u2019ve been embraced in that way. I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s very special, unique about that. You have a show that is about, at its core, these two teenage girls who need each other and have found that connection. And they\u2019re very, very different.\nSomething that I thought was a surprise this season was Christina Ricci coming back in Episodes 3 and 4. Was that always in the plan, how did that come to be?\nThat was something in the initial story. We wanted to kind of close off the Thornhill-Tyler relationship and we wanted the death to be impactful, but it really drives Tyler\u2019s character going forward because we\u2019ve set up that a hyde can\u2019t survive without their master. So the fact that he does that is a huge deal. And also, when you have a character like that, you want to show in this world that people can die and there are real stakes. So I think that\u2019s something that was important.\nWednesday Season 2 Part 1 is now streaming. Season 2 Part 2 begins streaming on Netflix on September 3."

      "text": "All Rights reserved\nBy continuing to use our site, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n15 Lesbian & Sapphic Marvel Ships the Stans Absolutely Love\nFans can't get enough of these sapphic MCU ships.\nWhile the Marvel Cinematic Universe is great at setting up male/male pairings, its history with good female characters is a little more fraught. At first there were Pepper Potts, Black Widow, Jane Foster and, um... no one? But queer fans have been in the fandom since day one, and wouldn't let a lack of ladies stop them from shipping their favorite characters.\nA lot of these are huge stretches because the MCU doesn't feed us at all when it comes to WLW ships. Things are starting to get much, much better, but still, the amount of fics and fanart for these characters is nothing compared to those we get for male/male pairings. But that never stopped fan artists, fic writers, and stans from shipping. So here are 15 of MCU fans' favorite lesbian and sapphic ships.\nNatasha Romanoff/Wanda Maximoff\nWhen Wanda joined the Avengers, Natasha was there to act as the mature, older woman to guide her and help her along the way. Maybe she can teach her about more than just becoming an Avenger...\nSharon Carter/Natasha Romanoff\nAgain, early on in the MCU we had very few women we could ship with each other, so for most of its history, most of the WLW ships have been with Black Widow. These two spys are both super capable, ruthless, and total bosses.\nNebula/Mantis\nThe mean girl/nice girl pairing of our dreams! With Nebula's gruff and closed-off attitude, and Mantis being a sweet and somewhat naive foil, the two make the perfect shipping pair.\nJane Foster/Darcy Lewis\nThese were two of the first women in the MCU to have a friendship, so of course fans ship them! Maybe the fun-loving and laid-back Darcy can help Jane relax in the hot New Mexico desert while she does her research.\nValkyrie/Carol Danvers\nOkay, so Captain Marvel and Valkyrie technically haven't been on screen together yet, but that can't stop fans from hoping. The real-life friendship between actors Brie Larson and Tessa Thompson certainly helped push this ship forward.\nNebula/Gamora\nOkay, yeah they're siblings. But these two have chemistry! All Nebula wants is for her older sister to love her, but she only knows how to show it through violence. And Gamora is equally dysfunctional, trying to be a hero all while avoiding the one person who needs her the most. It's honestly a pretty great dynamic (but, you know, they're sisters).\nLady Sif/Valkyrie\nTwo of the greatest warriors in the MCU would make quite the pairing. Valkyrie's still looking for her new Queen of Asgard, so maybe Lady Sif is the right woman for the job. I honestly thought that this was about to happen at the end of Thor: Love and Thunder, but Marvel once again let us down.\nZoe Zimmer/Kamala Khan\nUm, was that chemistry we sensed between Kamala Khan and her frenemy Zoe in the first episode of Ms. Marvel? The two aren't friends at school where Zoe is popular and Kamala is not, but their paths cross at Avengers Con, where both are cosplaying Captain Marvel. After some mishaps, Ms. Marvel saves Zoe, who seems to be pretty enamored with the hero. Zoe is gay in the comics, and the show has hinted that she is as well.\nPeggy Carter/Natasha Romanoff\nBlack Widow and Captain America is a classic MCU ship, and it's made even better when you replace Steve Trevor with Peggy Carter in this What If... episode. Imagine that scene in The Winter Soldier where Black Widow and Cap kiss on the escalator, but imagine it with supersized Peggy instead.\nMaria Hill/Natasha Romanoff\nFor a while, these two were pretty much the only women in the MCU who weren't male character's love interests. There really wasn't anyone else to ship, so MCU stans made do with what we had. Now it's grown into one of the most popular WLW ships in the MCU!\nJane Foster/Valkyrie\nAfter Tessa Thompson said that Valkyrie would be looking for a queen in Thor: Love and Thunder, fans thought that meant she'd get a girlfriend. One popular theory and ship was Valkyrie with Jane Foster's Mighty Thor. How perfect would it have been for Jane to come back only to swerve right past Thor and go to be with Valkyrie instead?\nYelena Belova/Kate Bishop\nTalk about chemistry!!! The MCU truly gave us an all-time great ship when it put Kate Bishop and Yelena Belova in scenes together in the show Hawkeye. Remember that elevator scene?? Remember the mac and cheese??? After Marvel de-aged Kate's comic book bestie/flirting pal America Chavez, at least they gave us this top tier ship.\nAgatha Harkness/Wanda Maximoff\nWho doesn't love a ship with a little darkness to it? These two witches and mortal enemies have quite the dynamic. Best friends by day, secret witches and enemies by night. How can we not love them?\nMaria Rambeau/Carol Danvers\nEvery lesbian who saw Captain Marvel instantly saw the chemistry between Carol and her \"best friend\" Maria who she was raising a child with. Harold, they're lesbians.\nYelena Belova/Natasha Romanoff\nBlack Widow wasn't a great movie, but it gave us this great performance by Florence Pugh as Natasha's little sister, who just wants some love from her family, even if they were technically just spies all along. It was real to her, and fans want Natasha to show her just how real it can get.\nLatest Stories\nLuke Evans: A treasure trove of 89 thirst traps\nQueens of Instagram!

      "text": "Wednesday and Enid fans are having their hearts played with in season two of the hit Netflix show.\nWednesday season 2 premiered this week on the popular streamer, and fans of the Wednesday-Enid ship are noticing a change in their dynamic. Now, one of the show's stars has addressed that dynamic in a new interview with Deadline.\nSign up for the Out Newsletter to keep up with what's new in LGBTQ+ culture and entertainment \u2014 delivered three times a week straight (well\u2026) to your inbox!\nEnid and Wednesday are now friends after a bumpy start together, where the cold and confrontational Wednesday took some time to warm up to Enid. However, their friendship is facing some strain, as Wednesday had a vision that Enid would be doomed, and has a new friend, Evie.\nEmma Myers \u2014 who plays Enid \u2014 told Deadline that she thinks Enid is feeling replaced, and \"a bit insecure in their friendship, and doesn't know why Wednesday's pushing her out,\" adding: \"It's definitely an interesting dynamic and journey to explore in this new season, because we haven't seen them like this before.\"\n\"I think they both have a sort of unspoken understanding of one another,\" she continued. \"When Enid sees that Wednesday's pushing her out, she doesn't realize why, because she thinks they got past that last season. There's this little push and pull that both of them have, and it's very confusing for her.\"\nWhile many of the show's viewers ship Wednesday and Enid, both characters have had exclusively male love interests.\nIn the first season, Wednesday was in a love triangle with Xavier (Percy Hynes White) and Tyler (Hunter Doohan). In the current season, Enid is stuck choosing between two boys: Ajax (Georgie Famer) and Bruno (Noah B. Taylor).\nAfter the first season, the show's creators (Al Gough and Miles Millar) shared that they see Wednesday and Enid's relationship as a \"sisterhood,\" but are \"not gonna discount anything, and obviously, sometimes characters reveal themselves.\"\n\"We wanna explore that friendship in every way, but we're not gonna be, this is where you sometimes get misdirected by fans and things like that, so it's just being really open to see how those characters develop and that friendship,\" Millar said. \"As Al said, that friendship is key to our sort of vision of the show.\"\nThe first part of Wednesday season 2 debuted on Netflix on August 6. The second part premieres on September 3."

      "text": "This week, Wednesday returned to Netflix for the first part of its highly anticipated second season. The first season introduced fans to this new take on the beloved Addams Family with a refreshing and feminist twist. You see, this time around, what was previously an ensemble piece is instead built around Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) venturing out on her own for the first time at a kooky, spooky, ooky boarding school full of outcasts and weirdos. As is the case with many a coming-of-age adventure story, the first season saw Wednesday making friends \u2014 well, frenemies \u2014 solving mysteries, and defeating monsters both figurative and, in her case, literal. But what made it stand out from the pack was that she did it all while behaving badly.\nIn fact, all the women of the school, Nevermore Academy, regularly and unapologetically behave badly. They break curfew, they cheat, they lie, they revel in darkness \u2014 and some of them even kill. And they invite us to come and cheer their misdeeds along.\nThat tradition continues its sophomore season.\nWednesday herself is the antithesis of the gentle, people-pleasing archetype women are frequently socialized to be. She outright refuses to \u201cbe nice\u201d \u2014 whether to friends, foes, authority figures, or family. She is who she is, unapologetically.\nJenna Ortega and Emma Myers in Wednesday\nNetflix\nIt\u2019s thrilling \u2014 it\u2019s also queer. Not because queerness equates to villainy, but because it makes room for us to buck the prescribed narrative. We live outside the box. Everything we do is radical simply by being ourselves. In that, Wednesday Addams \u2014 and all the women who both support and defy her \u2014 also enjoy an innate queerness.\nThat spirit of liberation is not lost on Ortega, who in season two portrays a Wednesday who is somehow even more self-assured in her utter and abject refusal to conform to the norms of, well, the normies.\n\u201cIt's nice to see women misbehave,\u201d Ortega tells PRIDE of her character and the women of Wednesday. \u201cThere's so much societal pressure on women in general that it's nice and it's important that we see them as flawed.\u201d\n\u201cThey play in the gray,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt's so much more interesting than, you know, the damsel in distress or the pretty girl who doesn't say much.\u201d\nFor Ortega, Wednesday represents the kind of woman she feels belongs on the screen \u2014 for other young women to be inspired by \u2014 because she has so much depth and complexity.\n\u201cIt's such a pleasure to be able to do it with characters who are so unapologetically themselves and strong and consistent in their behavior,\u201d she shares.\nHer hope is that young people will see a young woman who isn't afraid to \u201cuse her voice\u201d or \u201cstick to her guns.\u201d\nCatherine Zeta-Jones in Wednesday\nNetflix\nBut it's not just young women of today who can appreciate the catharsis of seeing badly behaved women on screen. It\u2019s a trope that dates back to the dawn of cinema and the femme fatales who once ruled the silver screen before being forced back into the closet of respectability by the Hays Code in 1934, and for three decades after.\nIn part, that legacy of suppression \u2014 and the way it forced queer and nonconformist characters into the liminal space of subtext for decades \u2014 is why Wednesday still feels subversive, even in its otherwise YA-friendly series.\nCatherine Zeta-Jones, who reprises her role as Morticia Addams in season two with a delightfully expanded presence, credits the series\u2019 popularity in part to how it celebrates difference \u2014 and the queerness that implies.\nCatherine Zeta-Jones and Jenna Ortega in Wednesday\nNetflix\n\u201cI think what the show does ... is that we avoid stereotypes,\u201d she tells PRIDE. \u201cWe spend our lives trying to fit into a perfect box of what's accepted, of physically, how one looks, and how one should be perceived. In this Addams world, it's the polar opposite.\u201d\n\u201cWe embrace the differences we want, the diversity we want, the inclusion of people who are just different, they're imperfect. That's okay,\u201d she adds.\nFor Zeta-Jones, the impact of this message is only compounded by the legacy of The Addams Family, which has been woven throughout pop culture since the 1960s, and how it's become part of our collective subconscious.\n\u201cIt's been decades [but] they kind of had a very clear insight into what a perfect family or society should be, which I think is wonderful,\u201d she notes.\nIt\u2019s also not just the Addams gals who present the audience with complex and badly behaved women. Emma Myers and Joy Sunday also return this season, reprising their roles as Enid and Bianca, respectively.\nBoth girls find themselves at a crossroads in season two \u2014 for Enid, it\u2019s of the romantic variety, and for Bianca, it\u2019s a moral and ethical dilemma about how and when she should wield her power. What makes each of these stories so compelling is that, in the world of Wednesday, there are no easy answers. Both are dabbling in the gray.\nJoy Sunday in Wednesday\nNetflix\nEnid continues her evolution of empowerment and the pursuit of who she wants and who she wants to be.\n\u201cI'm inspired by Enid\u2019s ability to just unapologetically be herself all the time, no matter what others are thinking or feeling or telling her to do,\u201d agrees Myers to PRIDE.\nMeanwhile, Sunday is enjoying Bianca\u2019s journey of wrestling with what it means to be such a powerful woman and \u201cwhat that says about young women who also feel this unbridled power kind of bursting from their seams,\u201d she tells PRIDE. \u201cIt's amazing what that power can do when it's wielded correctly,\u201d she teases.\nIndividually, these stories are worthy of note, but together they weave a tapestry of a world that flips societal expectations on its head, lending the entire series an innately queer perspective. Plus, as Ortega agrees, it just feels good to watch women be bad.\nJenna Ortega in Wednesday\nNetflix"

      "text": "It\u2019s been a wild three years for Hunter Doohan. The actor, now 31, scored his first speaking part on Westworld in 2018. He followed with breakthrough roles in Apple TV+\u2019s Truth Be Told and Showtime\u2019s Your Honor. But it was Netflix\u2019s Wednesday that catapulted him to star status after the first season\u2019s release in 2022. Tim Burton\u2019s Addams Family spin-off was a commercial hit for the streaming giant as well as a viral sensation; Jenna Ortega\u2019s Fosse-inspired school dance number, with Doohan as her awestruck date, became ubiquitous on social media and a milestone moment in pop culture.\n\u201cI had done Your Honor, and I kind of thought that was the level of things,\u201d Doohan says of his spike in popularity. \u201cAnd then Wednesday came out, and it truly was just like overnight. It felt like the level of exposure had changed. It\u2019s a weird thing to try to get used to. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m there yet, but it\u2019s been fun.\u201d\nMany big things have happened for Doohan since Wednesday put him in the spotlight. Not only did he marry his husband just a month after the show premiered (the wedding was officiated by his Your Honor costar Bryan Cranston), but he has also landed a wide range of roles, including the sadistic big bad of Daredevil: Born Again, a serial killer named Muse. He also recently signed on to play a lead role in the next installment of the beloved Evil Dead franchise.\nBut next up, he\u2019s making his eagerly anticipated return to the creepy, kooky, mysterious, and spooky world of Wednesday, which returned for its second season August 6. In it, Doohan reprises his role as Tyler Galpin, the love interest of Wednesday Addams (Ortega). Well, maybe not so much a love interest anymore. As fans may recall, Tyler was not the sweet \u201cnormie\u201d next door we thought he was. In the penultimate episode of season 1, he was revealed to be a Hyde \u2014 an unhinged, bulgy-eyed creature whose species was banned from Nevermore Academy. After his murderous antics were put to an end, a defeated Tyler was last seen being hauled off to Willowhill Psychiatric Hospital. Even though Tyler had deceived Wednesday, Doohan teases that there could still be a complicated romance between the two.\n'Wednesday' star Hunter Doohan returns for season 2 of the popular Netflix series.AB+DM/Netflix\n\u201cI think Tyler is flirting and trying to get under her skin,\u201d Doohan reveals while talking about Tyler\u2019s first pivotal scene with Wednesday, which comes in episode 2 of season 2. \u201cI think he\u2019s been dreaming of her coming to see him. And I think he feels really hurt and abandoned by her when he thought she was the only one who wouldn\u2019t do that to him. So he\u2019s definitely full of rage and wanting revenge after that encounter.\u201d\nAs for what twists and turns fans can expect this season, Doohan remains tight-lipped, but describes this season\u2019s story as \u201cbigger\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d with \u201cso many layers to it,\u201d teasing that, for Tyler, \u201cthere\u2019s something huge that people are not going to see coming. It\u2019s a wild ride.\u201d\nWhen we first see Tyler this season, he\u2019s imprisoned in a cell, shackled in chains with a shock collar around his neck. It\u2019s very reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. Once again, Doohan gets to chew the scenery with that complex Tyler/Hyde duality, while drawing inspiration from some notable movie maniacs.\n\u201cI kind of just sat in my apartment chained up a lot,\u201d he quips with a laugh. \u201cAl [Gough] and Miles [Millar], our showrunners, were like, \u2018This scene is so \u2018Hello, Clarice.\u2019 Even in season 1, when I did that turn in the police station, I was using [The Silence of the Lambs] as a touch point for me. Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker is one of the greatest villain turns of all time, and then, like, Edward Norton in Primal Fear was one. Even Scream, like Billy Loomis \u2014 that switch \u2014 those were probably the four references that we would talk about.\u201d\nThe same scene Doohan is discussing has his gay fan base in a tizzy. You see, Tyler is shirtless and in chains when Wednesday comes to see him, and there\u2019s a promo photo floating around that has his admirers swooning.\n\u201cYou read the script and it\u2019s like, Chained, shirtless, hmm \u2014 there\u2019s a layer of vanity. You want to look your best,\u201d he explains when asked if he bulked up for this season. \u201cBut I tried to make sense of it too, because obviously, when Tyler turns into Hyde, is where he has his full strength and power, but we do establish he has some of his ability when he\u2019s in his human form. There\u2019s moments in the season where I throw somebody across a room just as Tyler. Can\u2019t do that in real life, but wanted to try my best to look as capable as possible. I wanted him to feel feral and like a caged animal, a little bit.\u201d\nDoohan appears \"chained and shirtless\" in season 2 of 'Wednesday.'Jonathan Hession/Netflix\nDoohan is aware that the thirst is real within his fan base. After all, his fans did get a good look at his physique when he shared his 2023 Calvin Klein underwear photos on his official Instagram. As for being seen as a sex symbol within the gay community and the flirtatious social media responses that come with it, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s fun. Bring it on. Love it.\u201d\nSo, what\u2019s next for Doohan? The rising star says he plans to change it up a bit and steer away from those \u201cjuicy\u201d villain roles. This fall, he\u2019ll be seen in The Wilderness, which he calls a \u201cvery grounded real-life drama.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s the aforementioned Evil Dead Burn, where he plays a character he describes as \u201cvery different.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just so excited to step into that world, and our director, S\u00e9bastien Vani\u010dek, is amazing; his first film, Infested, was so sick!\u201d exclaims Doohan, who is pumped about joining the long-running horror franchise. \u201cHe\u2019s the perfect person to take the reins on this new one, Evil Dead Burn; it\u2019s gonna be amazing.\u201d\nWith Wednesday, Daredevil: Born Again, and the upcoming Evil Dead Burn on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Doohan is over the moon about being a part of three franchises that have such rich histories and passionate fan bases. He\u2019s grateful for being offered a wide range of roles. Even though the characters he\u2019s best known for aren\u2019t explicitly queer, he\u2019s certainly auditioned for some gay roles and hopes to one day land the right one.\n\u201cI\u2019m out and a gay actor, and I feel really lucky that I\u2019ve gotten to play a wide range of roles. I think I\u2019m so lucky to be living in a time where that doesn\u2019t feel as much of a limitation,\u201d he shares. \u201cI truthfully haven\u2019t been offered a bunch of gay roles. And I would love to play a queer character, not for the sake of it being queer, but like a great character who is queer. I\u2019ve auditioned for a bunch [laughs] \u2014 but haven\u2019t gotten cast as them. But that\u2019ll come and I\u2019ll find a great script.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just grateful for the queer actors before me and just queer people in general who have paved the way for me to be able to have this privilege of being able to play these characters,\u201d he adds. \u201cJonathan Bailey is a huge inspiration for me. Look at the films and franchises he\u2019s leading as a leading man, and that\u2019s really inspiring.\u201d\nThere is one other gig on Doohan\u2019s wish list \u2014 and it\u2019s not what you think. During the production of Wednesday season 1, Doohan binge-watched 14 seasons of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race and became a superfan. With his acting chops, gay heartthrob status, and a love for fashion (he attended Saint Laurent\u2019s show June 24, during Paris Men\u2019s Fashion Week), he\u2019d certainly make a great guest judge or participant in an acting challenge, wouldn\u2019t he?\n\u201cListen, from your lips to Ru\u2019s ears, let\u2019s go,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is literally a dream bucket list item for me. I definitely want to be there at some point.\u201d\nSeason 2 of Wednesday will debut Thursday on Netflix.

He's always reading and watching stuff. We'll go to trivia nights and I just kind of sit there and smile and watch him win the game for us.\"\nWhen the hosts asked how the couple met, Doohan replied, \"Tinder.\"\nHe further explained, \"We met in like 2015 and then got engaged during the pandemic. The pandemic was great for me because I'd been off shooting Your Honor for six months in New Orleans. So I came back and all of a sudden we got to spend time together. We had so many friends that either broke up or got married during the pandemic or had a baby.\"\nThe couple keeps the bulk of details regarding their relationship relatively quiet. Doohan posted a picture of the couple at their wedding with a caption saying, \"Trying to sum up your wedding day in an Instagram caption is hard... It was absolutely the best day of our lives! Thank you to everyone who made it so special.\"\nBesides doting on his husband, Doohan also reminisced about discovering RuPaul's Drag Race while filming Wednesday in Romania, which became his obsession on the shoot. \"That was a life-saving thing just to like binge 14 seasons of Drag Race in between acting like a monster on set,\" he said.\nMonster or not, the Doohan-Jewetts give us major couple goals. Here's to hoping we can all swipe right on our future husbands as well!\nRELATED | 'Young Royals' Stars Share Details About 'Bittersweet' Season 3 Ending"
