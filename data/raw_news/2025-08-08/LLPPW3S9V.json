  "title": "Airbnb, Inc. Just Beat EPS By 9.5%: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
  "description": "NasdaqGS:ABNB 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Airbnb's Fair Values from the Community and select yours Airbnb...",
  "content": "Explore Airbnb's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) just released its second-quarter report and things are looking bullish. The company beat expectations with revenues of US$3.1b arriving 2.2% ahead of forecasts. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) were US$1.03, 9.5% ahead of estimates. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nAfter the latest results, the 40 analysts covering Airbnb are now predicting revenues of US$12.1b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a credible 4.5% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$4.26, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$12.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.24 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$140. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Airbnb analyst has a price target of US$200 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$96.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Airbnb's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 9.2% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 23% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 9.7% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while Airbnb's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's expected to grow roughly in line with the industry.",
