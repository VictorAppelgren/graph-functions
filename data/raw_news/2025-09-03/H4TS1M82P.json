  "description": "Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, breaks down the latest economic data as the Fed contends with questions around rate cuts and whether it will cut interest rates.  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "We are no longer making progress towards the Fed's 2% target. I mean, earlier in this year, you could still point to some progress. Right now it is more that we've stalled out and there has been a really robust conversation about tariffs and how this could be a temporary factor. I think that's what's you do see that in the goods inflation. I think it's going to take a long time for that to work its way out. That'll be a lift to inflation. To me, the part of the PC inflation drive that was really disconcerting was on the services side and particularly the non housing core services, which the Fed refers to as super core. We have start, we really look like we were making some progress earlier this year and it is just not we're back up at a pace of inflation in those categories is just not comfortable and you know isn't is not pointed in the right direction and it's a lot harder there to point to tariffs. Claudia Now going in the right direction. Is the environment ripe for a rate cut at next month's meeting then? So I thought I'd share. Pablo did a really good job last Friday, Jackson Hole, outlining the risks to the economy. And this is a challenging economic environment. The dual mandate is in tension. There are reasons to expect inflation to go even higher from where it is right now. It's already elevated and there are reasons to be worried about employment really going lower and having some deterioration in the labor market. And so it is a matter of sifting through every bit of data and trying to get a sense of where those what that balance of risks is, because you there's no there's no path for the Fed that will check both boxes like they are intention. So I agree with the assessment that, you know, doing maybe an insurance cut in September, kind of trying to stay ahead of the labor market weakness makes sense given where the Fed funds rate is. But I don't see the case to be signaling, like Fed Governor Waller did last night, that we're like lining up a whole sequence of cuts. I have a feeling we're going to be like in this back and forth push and pull of the inflation employment data probably through the end of this year. Well, you make a great point. I mean, you consider the fact that you have the dual mandate, the two sides in conflict. We haven't been in a dynamic like this in a while. Claudia And that was going to be my question to you. If we do enter a situation where, okay, you have the labor market weakening, but you have core inflation stuck maybe closer to three than it is to 2%. I mean, realistically, how much room does the Federal Reserve have to cut rates? And if they're stuck in a stop and go situation when it comes to rate cuts, I mean, how much are these kind of one off 25 basis point cuts actually going to matter in this economy? It was mentioned on the street with the unemployment rate as low as it is, and in particular as stable as it's been over the last year. They can they can proceed carefully. Right. So and then in a 25 basis point cut at one meeting, maybe we cut again soon. Maybe we don't like that. That's what carefully looks like in Fed fed world. Right now, they they absolutely have the space. If things in the labor market were to really start to gain downward momentum. You know, the federal funds rate is above 4%. There's a lot of room to cut. There's a lot of room to respond if they need to. And they'll switch gears. But the data do not. They're not there yet. They were talking about risk. We're not talking about is happening. And so I think they're in a good place. But, my goodness, it is it is so hard to catch the economy when it's turning. And it could be. You know, we talk a lot about the labor market as a potential turn. But you could have inflation take off. And, you know, like these these kind of moments where you're trying to get that right. You know, that's that's very tough. And, you know, they they may get it wrong, but I think that's where like being careful and deliberate is going to be the strategy that works for them. And Claudio, we have a kind of pretty strong set of data that we're going to get before that September Fed meeting. What are you keeping an eye on? What can kind of vindicate vindicate the push to do a quarter point basis or a quarter point cut in September, or what could actually kind of throw those plans a straight. It was. The logic of the setup for the September cut is more in an insurance space. It's about risks. So, you know, we've got one inflation print, one employment print. Is that going to totally change the picture of risk? Probably not. Like what the employment report last month was a game changer, but that is a very rare occurrence. And we shouldn't expect getting that kind of like news in one release. So I think, you know, they're on a path to be able to do a cut in September. I fully expect we're going to see dissents like this is a tough one. Like I you know, I can see reasons to be concerned about it on the inflation side, we're going to get stuck at 3%, you know, So I think we'll see some differences of opinion and differences in votes. And that's a healthy thing. And it just underscores, like this is a tough environment for them to decide. I think of the two reports, probably the employment report is going to give more kind of signal to what's the right thing to do. In all likelihood, you know, we're going to get another inflation report that's that's firming up and they're going to have to be able to make the case we are cutting as inflation is rising. And I think they can. But that is that is not a typical moment for the Fed to cut. And of course, all eyes on the Fed at that FOMC meeting next month, not just for the rate decision, but also for the politicized nature of what's going on at the Federal Reserve right now. Claudia, And do you think about what's unfolding right now in DC? We know that Fed Governor Lisa Cook has sued President Trump over his attempt to oust her from her position right now. And Claudia, I mean, we've been discussing with each other what's going on when it comes to this administration, the pressure that it's trying to exert on the central bank. What sticks out to me is the apparent non reaction that we're seeing in markets right now. I keep hearing that the worst case scenario is we end up in a situation that pressures the long entire. But Claudia, we're just not seeing that kind of stress come through. Right. It's we are in uncharted territory. It is hard for investors, particularly kind of massive investors to kind of really see where this could go. Really, this is just a level of creativity that maybe financial markets don't typically, you know, in foresight that they don't typically have. I think this this is a real risk. What has happened this week with Fed Governor Lisa Cook, to me, this just the latest in a series of efforts by the White House to gain more control over monetary policy. And they've been very clear what they want. If they get more control and that is ultra low Fed funds rate. And I think at this point, you know, this is something that the Fed itself, when it talks about what are the inflation risks, a Fed that is no longer independent like that is in the mix now in, you know, which is just really shocking. But, you know, if control is lost well and interest rates go very low, then we are talking about an inflationary episode. And so, you know, if we get there, I fully expect markets to react strongly. But it's just you know, it's it's a risk that's out there and it just still feels maybe to investors, like just not possible. But unfortunately, I think it's it's a real risk. The risk is rising. Yeah. Claudia, just quickly here, if that does happen, where do you think investors are going to shift their assets to? Yeah. I think this, you know, this would be this will be a very messy adjustment if we get there. And it also, you know, the expectations of inflation taking off, I mean, should build in very quickly. But is as with the tariffs, it's not like it shows up the next day. Right. It's a process. Like it would you know, we could have the macroeconomic effects of it could be pretty subtle in the beginning. It's more the you know, the in in the U.S. and around the world. When politicians take control of monetary policy, on average, usually it goes to a bad place in terms of higher inflation and more financial and economic instability. So exactly what that would look like, I don't know, but I really don't want to see it happen. But, you know, like I said, it's a risk. But I think it's actually we're at a point now where like it is a real risk.",

  "summary": "The Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge, which tracks the 2% target, has remained a standstill. This is due to ongoing discussions about tariffs, which could boost inflation. However, the services side, particularly non-housing core services, have been identified as a concern. The dual mandate of the Federal Reserve is in tension, with reasons to expect inflation to rise higher and concerns about employment going lower and a deterioration in the labor market. Some believe an insurance cut in September would make sense given the Fed's current Fed funds rate. Others believe this is a prudent strategy for the Fed, but the data indicates that inflation is not yet on the horizon.",
