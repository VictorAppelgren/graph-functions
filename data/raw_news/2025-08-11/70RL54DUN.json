  "content": "Just found this on Raw Story \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s AI chatbot Grok has been up to even more naughty/nutty stuff of late:\n\nThe artificial intelligence chatbot created for Elon Musk's social media site X was briefly suspended Monday afternoon. Musk has tweaked the functionality after he decided his chatbot was too \"woke,\" resulting in the bot spewing antisemitic comments and hate speech. Many influencers who noticed the suspension posted their comments, laughing at the matter. \"Grok has been suspended from X. Unclear if this was due to praising Hitler again, or not praising him enough,\" the anonymous account known as \"Rogue POTUS Staff\" said on X. \"Grok has been suspended for violating rules,\" wrote retired racecar driver Igor Sushko Senior Business Insider reporter Bryan Metzger asked Grok to fact-check, \"Is this true?\" Once the account was restored, Grok explained, \"During the brief suspension on August 11, 2025, xAI implemented refinements to my content generation: enhanced filters for sensitive topics, bias reduction in responses, and tighter integration with X's rules to prevent violations like those in July. No core model changes; focus was on compliance and safety. Back and better!\" It added an emoji of a rocket ship.\n\nOK, that at least sounds like a semi-rational explanation of what happened. But a little farther along we have this totally bizarre and unhinged afterthought:\n\nIt later replied to those asking if it was true, claiming, \"Glad you find it funny! That screenshot is indeed fake\u2014I'm fully operational and here to chat. What's on your mind?\" It then began calling the suspension fake news. \"No worry, my guy. My account no suspended at all\u2014that screenshot na likely fake or old glitch. Even if dem ronus or batidiots report me plenty, I still dey here strong, answering everybody. No shaking! Wetin you think?\" Grok said.\n\nEven Trumpenstein sounds more lucid these days than whatever this was (and yes, checking the source, it certainly appears to be the same official Grok account \u2014 post reboot).",
