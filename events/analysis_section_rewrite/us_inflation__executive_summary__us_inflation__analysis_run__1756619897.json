      "feedback": "The draft is overly verbose and contains several drifted or redundant clauses that dilute the core DXY view. 1) Remove the opening “The dollar index (DXY) has recently rallied 0.36 % …” sentence and replace it with a single, quantified base‑case: **DXY +0.3 % to +0.5 % over 3‑6 mo** (XTQIQRP5K). 2) Consolidate the catalyst paragraph into one causal chain: **Ukrainian comments → EURUSD retreat → short‑covering → DXY rally** (XTQIQRP5K), **Fed’s dovish stance (Bowman’s 3 cuts) + tariff truce + semiconductor tariff → risk‑off bias → DXY support** (XTQIQRP5K). 3) The “near‑term outlook for DXY is a decline of roughly 200 bp to 95.8 by the end of August” is contradictory to the base‑case and should be re‑phrased as a **short‑term dip of ~200 bp** pending the **Sept 25 Fed cut** (Z7O1DCHS7, 7XH2DKEKV). 4) Merge the steepening discussion into the same sentence: **2‑yr/10‑yr steepening (~57 bp) compresses real‑yield differential → temporary DXY dip** (Z7O1DCHS7, 7XH2DKEKV). 5) Replace the long “Short‑term upside hinges on August 30 PCE …” paragraph with a concise watch‑list: **Sept 25 Fed meeting, early‑Aug CPI, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread trend, Jackson Hole** (Z7O1DCHS7, XTQIQRP5K). 6) Re‑frame risks: **Fed hike (+10 bp to 10‑yr) or spread flattening <30 bp → DXY damp** (7XH2DKEKV, U21K4ALYQ); **tariff rollback or new tariffs → risk‑off erosion** (XTQIQRP5K); **Ukrainian/Russian rhetoric shift → euro‑market lift → DXY compression** (XTQIQRP5K). 7) Ensure every claim cites a source ID and maps to a canonical handle (DXY, ust10y, eurusd). 8) Trim any mention of “CPI > 3 % or NFP > expected would lift DXY 50–100 bp, not lower it” as it conflicts with the risk narrative. 9) End with a single sentence summarizing confidence: **Base case confidence moderate; DXY remains sensitive to Fed policy, tariff moves, and euro‑market sentiment** (XTQIQRP5K). This streamlined version meets the 4‑6 sentence limit, preserves causal clarity, and satisfies the handle‑mapping and catalyst‑window requirements.",
