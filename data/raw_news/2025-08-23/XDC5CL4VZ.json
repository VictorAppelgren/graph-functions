  "content": "While consumers have been largely shielded from the immediate price hikes expected from the latest round of U.S. tariffs, a period of reckoning may be approaching, according to top economist Mohamed A. El-Erian.\n\nTariff-Related Price Increases Could Be Felt Unevenly Across Economy\n\nIn a recent analysis, El-Erian argues that the real impact of the tariffs\u2014what some critics have labeled a direct \u201ctax\u201d on Americans\u2014has been delayed, not dismissed, and is poised to be felt unevenly across the economy.\n\nThe central mystery of the new tariff regime has been the absence of a significant, widespread spike in consumer prices. El-Erian explains that a combination of strategic corporate decisions and inventory management has created a temporary buffer.\n\nTrending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\nWhy Have Consumers Not Felt The Pressure Yet?\n\nErian explains that many foreign exporters and U.S. importing companies initially chose to absorb the tariff costs within their profit margins rather than risk losing market share over what they hoped might be a temporary policy. This absorption was the first line of defense for the American consumer\u2019s wallet.\n\nFurther softening the blow, many businesses stockpiled imported goods before the tariffs took effect. This allowed them to sell products at pre-tariff prices for an extended period, further masking the policy\u2019s inflationary potential.\n\nErian\u2019s view provides a more nuanced timeline for the argument made by commentators like investor Ross Gerber, who stated on X that tariffs are a consumption-based tax, contrary to their intended use as a trade policy tool for reshoring manufacturing, as they have been promoted.\n\nSeveral other prominent experts have echoed similar views in recent weeks, with investor Kevin O'Leary calling it a value-added tax on American consumers.\n\nAccording to El-Erian, the pass-through of these costs will not be uniform. The ultimate burden on consumers will depend heavily on the nature of the goods they buy.\n\nSee Also: In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage \u2014 Get Your Demo\n\nDemand Elasticity Will Determine What Becomes Expensive\n\nBusinesses selling products with \u201cinelastic demand\u201d\u2014essential items that consumers will purchase regardless of price changes\u2014are far more likely to pass on the full tariff cost. In contrast, companies serving lower-income consumers or selling goods with \u201celastic demand\u201d will face a tougher choice, as significant price hikes could destroy demand for their products.",

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nAmerica has a debt problem, and recent policy is making it worse. President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d is expected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and economists project that the debt-to-GDP ratio will go from 100% to 120% in the same timespan.\nAs a result, corporations and consumers will be stuck with high interest rates until something changes.\nThat change might just come from artificial intelligence, one company argues.\nRange is an AI-powered wealth management platform for high earners that centralizes investments, taxes, estate plans, and more in one account. The platform uses advanced AI technology to deliver personalized financial guidance at fees 75-90% lower than traditional advisors, making expert wealth management more accessible. Today, Range serves nearly 2,000 clients managing over $6 billion in assets.\nTaresh Batra, Range\u2019s vice president of Investments, says these AI-driven productivity gains could be the key to accelerating GDP growth while bringing inflation and interest rates down. \u201cHigher growth and lower interest rates as a result of AI could be a panacea for the markets,\u201d Batra says.\nProductivity is Key\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office uses the following formula to measure and forecast the country\u2019s GDP, or Gross Domestic Product:\nReal GDP Growth = Labor Growth(x labor contribution) + Capital Growth(x capital contribution) + Productivity\n\u201cOf these variables, changes in productivity have the largest impact on GDP growth,\u201d Batra says. \u201cTechnological innovation has been the driver of productivity over the course of history.\u201d\nAI, Batra argues, has the potential to improve productivity and benefit the economy in the coming years, similarly to how the dot-com boom did in the mid-1990s.\nHere\u2019s how:\n- Direct Economic Growth: With AI, companies and workers can be more productive without requiring additional resources.\n- More Jobs, Not Less: While AI may automate certain tasks, history shows that technology creates more jobs than it replaces. In fact, 60% of today\u2019s jobs didn\u2019t exist in 1940. The World Economic Forum projects AI will generate a net gain of 78 million new jobs this decade alone. Range itself exemplifies this trend by employing CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs who collaborate closely with AI engineers to build smarter financial tools.\n- Increased Tax Revenues: \u201cHigher productivity usually leads to higher corporate profits, wages, and economic activity\u2014all of which generate increased tax receipts,\u201d Batra says. \u201cMore government revenue means less need to borrow.\u201d\n- Disinflationary Pressure: \u201cLess government borrowing leads to lower inflationary pressure,\u201d Batra says. \u201cIn addition, productivity improvements reduce the cost of producing goods and services, which slows down inflation.\u201d\n- Improved Debt Dynamics & Lower Rates: Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates, which helps stimulate the economy and allows the government to spend less on interest expense and spend more money on the private sector.\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re already seeing measurable productivity gains in industries that have integrated AI tools into their workflow. Even if policymakers fail to rein in spending in the coming years, AI-driven productivity gains in the private sector may allow us to \u201cgrow our way\u201d out of fiscal distress.\n\u201cIf AI delivers even modest incremental productivity gains of 1-1.5% annually, the US could potentially maintain or reduce current debt-to-GDP levels despite continued spending growth,\u201d Batra says.\nAI Is Transforming, Not Destroying the Job Market\nYes, the rise of AI has resulted in people losing their jobs. This, however, is not a new phenomenon.\nTake farming, for example. Around 70% of people were employed in agriculture in the early 1800s, but that number is now less than 2% thanks to the creation of farming machines and other advancements.\nAt the same time, technological innovations not only created new jobs to replace the ones lost. They added new roles that previously never existed.\n\u201cRemarkably, 60% of the jobs people are employed in today didn't exist in 1940,\u201d Batra says. \u201cThat means nearly 90% of employment growth over the last 80 years resulted from technology creating entirely new categories of work.\u201d\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report estimates that AI and related technologies will create a net gain of 78 million new roles this decade.\nRange is living proof of this. They\u2019ve hired CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs as critical subject matter experts to help their AI engineers build and validate their platform.\n\u201cThese aren't traditional roles\u2014they represent the emergence of new types of knowledge workers who combine domain expertise with technological fluency,\u201d Batra says.\nHow You Could Bring the Power of AI Into Your Wealth Management With Range\nIn just four short years, Range has signed up almost 2,000 high income members and advises them on more than $6 billion in assets.\nCurrently in beta, Range\u2019s proprietary AI engine is capable of delivering financial insights and guidance in seconds, potentially allowing you to capitalize on opportunities and avoid any potential pitfalls \u2014 for example, if you should buy an investment property or if you can retire early based on your complete financial picture\nRange also operates on a flat-fee pricing model and offers portfolio management with 0% Assets Under Management fees, so you won\u2019t pay more as your net worth continues to grow.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade and tariff policies in recent months are essentially a tax on American citizens, according to Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management.\nTariffs Have Raised Taxes\nOn Thursday, in a post on X, Gerber said that the \u201ctariffs have raised taxes on Americans,\u201d referring to them as a consumption-based tax, contrary to their intended use as a trade policy tool for reshoring manufacturing, as they have been promoted.\nGerber also highlights their regressive nature, given the disproportionate impact they stand to have on households with lower disposable incomes. He says, the tariffs move \u201cthe cost of taxes from the rich to the rest of America.\u201d\nThe investor pointed out that while tariffs are imposed uniformly across goods and consumers, their impact is anything but fair, since they take up a significantly larger share of income at poorer households than at the wealthier ones.\nTariff A \u2018Value-Added Tax\u2019\nSeveral other prominent experts have echoed similar views in recent weeks, with investor Kevin O\u2019Leary calling it a value-added tax on American consumers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no American VAT tax. However, what Trump has done is exactly that, and he\u2019s called it something else,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cThe Europeans and the Canadians call theirs VAT. Who cares what it\u2019s called? It\u2019s a tax.\u201d\nLast week, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) announced plans for a bipartisan legislation targeting Trump\u2019s 15% to 20% tax on coffee. Khanna notes that America produces \u201cless than 1%\u201d of the coffee that it consumes, making it a significant financial burden for consumers.\nKhanna calls these tariffs a tax, saying that \u201cAnyone who has a coffee cup always in hand hates this tax!\u201d adding that this was essentially a \u201ctax on Americans at the start of their day,\u201d which has to go.\nFund manager Peter Boockvar, the CIO at Bleakley Financial Group, highlights the impact this is set to have on businesses. He says, \u201cIf we\u2019re left with a 15% tariff baseline on $3.3 trillion worth of imports, that\u2019s about $500 billion in new taxes,\u201d adding that it essentially undoes Trump\u2019s tax cuts from 2017.\nPhoto Courtesy: Tama2u on Shutterstock.com\nRead More:\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Investor and television personality Kevin O\u2019Leary, AKA \u201cMr. Wonderful,\u201d came out in defense of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade and tariff policies, framing them as a strategic response to global trade imbalances.\nWhat Happened: Speaking on the Impact Theory podcast on Wednesday, O\u2019Leary explained that many of America's trade partners, including Canada and the European Union, already impose consumption taxes on U.S. goods through VAT systems.\n\u201cMost of these countries have a VAT tax, a value-added tax, which is a tax that is a consumption tax at the consumer level,\u201d he said.\nSee Also: Trump Tariffs Hurt US Chocolate Makers, Give Edge To Canada, Mexico: Report\nIn O'Leary's view, Trump sees this as a de facto tariff and has since responded with his own. \u201cThere's no American VAT tax. However, what Trump has done is exactly that, and he's called it something else,\u201d referring to the new base tariffs that are set to be imposed on all countries.\n\u201cHe calls this a tariff. The Europeans and the Canadians call theirs VAT. Who cares what it's called? It's a tax.\u201d he says.\nWhile O\u2019Leary acknowledges Trump\u2019s bombastic public persona, referring to him as \u201ca walking press conference,\u201d he also emphasized his effectiveness in applying pressure through trade policy. \u201cTrump can be very pragmatic at times,\" he says.\nHe also says that if tariffs are applied reciprocally and stay around the 10% range, \u201cthe economies can live with\u201d that outcome. \u201cTrump put his VAT tax in place. Everything's equal. Even Steven, so to speak,\u201d he says.\nWhy It Matters: Earlier in the week, O\u2019Leary said during his appearance on Fox Business that the \u201ctariff drama\u201d is \u201csettling\u201d and the markets are \u201ccalming\u201d as Trump had found the loophole to impose a value-added tax.\nHe said, \u201cas long as the numbers are reasonable,\u201d that is, they range from 10% to 15%, then industry will adapt. \u201cThe market wants a headline number.\u201d\nWall Street analysts such as Goldman\u2019s Jan Hatzius have since echoed similar views, saying that tariff-driven inflation was likely to be a \u201cone-time price level shift akin to a VAT hike,\u201d rather than a prolonged issue.\nRead More:\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com.
