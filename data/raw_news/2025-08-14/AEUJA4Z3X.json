  "title": "Even at an All-Time High, The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF Isn't as Expensive as It Seems",
  "description": "Peeling back the veil on the S&P 500's elevated valuation reveals a rally grounded in logic.",
  "content": "Peeling back the veil on the S&P 500's elevated valuation reveals a rally grounded in logic.\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide low-cost ways to get exposure to a diversified basket of stocks. With over $1.5 trillion in assets, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.06%) is the largest S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.06%) fund by net assets -- even larger than the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust .\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is hovering around an all-time high at the time of this writing -- up 8.5% year to date and a whopping 66.4% since the start of 2023. But S&P 500 earnings haven't grown nearly as fast, which has pushed up the valuation of the index.\n\nHere's why the S&P 500 isn't as expensive as it seems, including a few reasons why it could still be a good buy at an all-time high.\n\nOne simple way to measure the S&P 500's valuation is to look at the price appreciation of the index compared to changes in its operating earnings per share (EPS). Operating earnings can be a better metric for tracking the valuation of the S&P 500 because they exclude one-time charges or gains that don't accurately represent the performance of the underlying businesses.\n\nHere's a look at how the S&P 500 has traded in comparison to its operating EPS over different intervals.\n\nAs you can see in the table, the S&P 500 is rising faster than operating earnings, which has expanded its valuation. Overall, the businesses that make up the S&P 500 are relatively expensive based on their performance.\n\nAnother way of looking at S&P 500 valuation is forward earnings projections. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 takes the current price and divides it by analyst consensus estimates for earnings over the next year rather than the trailing 12 months.\n\nAccording to data from FactSet from Aug. 1, the forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is 22.2 compared to a five-year average forward P/E of 19.9 and a 10-year average forward P/E of 18.5. So the S&P 500 commands a 20% premium to its 10-year average. On the surface, it looks like the index is massively overvalued. However, the valuation of the S&P 500 and companies in general should arguably go up over time as companies become more efficient.\n\nThe internet and the instant transfer of information have made doing business much more efficient. Just think about the time savings from sending an email versus a fax or hopping on a video call instead of traveling to meet in person. Then, there is also the transition from having several analog devices performing independent tasks -- like an alarm clock or calculator -- to having many tools available at arm's reach, all on a single mobile phone.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) should further increase worker productivity, and in turn, boost company performance. As companies across industries become better businesses, the overall valuation of the market should steadily tick higher.\n\nIt is natural for the valuation of the S&P 500 to rise over time as growth-focused companies make up a larger portion of the index. Companies that reinvest their profits rather than distributing them to shareholders through buybacks and dividends should command higher valuations as those investments generate returns.\n\nIt's not the best idea to glance at what the valuation of the S&P 500 is today versus the average of the last decade and hastily assume the S&P 500 is overvalued without considering the valid reasons why the index is more expensive. By the same token, it's a mistake to gloss over the risks of today's market.\n\nGrowth-driven companies have increased the quality of S&P 500 earnings and the projected growth rate, but they can also boost market volatility. A cyclical downturn in investment in the tech sector would have a sizable impact on the S&P 500, more so than when tech had a lower weight in the index.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 deserves to have a higher than historical valuation, so the ETFs that track the index aren't as expensive as they seem. However, don't be surprised if the index makes sharper moves to the upside and the downside, given its composition.",

      "text": "Beating the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over an extended period of time is no easy task. Just 8% of active large-cap U.S. equity stock funds outperformed the index over the last 20 years.\nOne of the most effective ways to beat the index is to have a few winners that do really well. Buying a stock like Amazon 20 years ago would have produced monster returns, allowing investors to take an otherwise mediocre portfolio and transform it into an elite one.\nHaving outsized positions in large-cap growth stocks has been the secret sauce for beating the S&P 500 over the last decade, which is exactly what the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG 0.22%) aims to do. Here's why the exchange-traded fund (ETF) could continue to do well over the long term.\nThe Growth ETF gains are driven by just three stock market sectors\nThe Vanguard Growth ETF has a 0.04% expense ratio compared to 0.03% for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.09%), which is just a $1 difference for every $10,000 invested. So there's essentially a negligible cost to choose the Growth ETF over the S&P 500 ETF.\nAs you can see in the following table, the Growth ETF has crushed the S&P 500 over the last decade -- largely thanks to outperformance periods in 2017, 2020, 2023, and 2024.\n|\n2015 |\n2016 |\n2017 |\n2018 |\n2019 |\n2020 |\n2021 |\n2022 |\n2023 |\n2024 |\n2025 YTD |\n|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\nVanguard Growth ETF |\n3.3% |\n6.3% |\n27.7% |\n(3.3%) |\n37% |\n40.2% |\n27.3% |\n(33.2%) |\n46.8% |\n32.7% |\n10.5% |\n|\nVanguard S&P 500 ETF |\n1.3% |\n12.2% |\n21.8% |\n(4.5%) |\n31.4% |\n18.3% |\n28.8% |\n(18.2%) |\n26.3% |\n25% |\n9% |\nYou'll notice that the Growth ETF fell much more than the S&P 500 in 2022, but that decline was more than made up for with outsized gains in many other years. Even when factoring in the S&P 500's higher dividend yield, the total return for the Vanguard Growth ETF is up 353.4% over the decade compared to 264.2% for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- which is the difference between turning $10,000 into $45,240 versus $36,420 with no extra effort.\nIf the technology, communications, and consumer discretionary sectors continue to outperform the S&P 500, so will the Growth ETF. The Growth ETF has a combined weighting in these sectors of 80.1% compared to 53.3% for the S&P 500. So while the S&P 500 has become more concentrated in these sectors, the Growth ETF takes it to a whole new level by being drastically underweight in financials, healthcare, energy, consumer staples, materials, real estate, and utilities. Both sectors have roughly equal exposure to industrials -- which is cyclical and somewhat of a blend between growth, income, and value.\nReinvesting excess profits rather than distributing them can accelerate earnings growth\nThe Vanguard Growth ETF is betting big on just a handful of names, with roughly two-thirds of the fund concentrated in just 15 companies -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Broadcom, Tesla, Eli Lilly, Visa, Mastercard, Netflix, Costco Wholesale, and Palantir Technologies. These companies have contributed a disproportionate amount of gains to the S&P 500 compared to the average S&P 500 holding. And since the Growth ETF is overweight in these names compared to the index, it has benefited even more from their outperformance.\nThe valuations of many of these companies are significantly higher than they used to be, which may lead some investors to wonder how much longer their outperformance can last before they revert to the mean. While it's easy to look at the price action of these companies and say they are overvalued, a better question is to ask what is stopping these companies from continuing to beat the market? Or even more specifically, what's holding these companies back from growing earnings at an above-average rate, therefore justifying higher stock prices?\nAt their core, what separates growth stocks from value stocks is capital allocation. A stodgy, mature business like Coca-Cola will sometimes acquire new drinks or invest in organic growth. But the opportunities are limited. So management prioritizes returning excess profits to shareholders through dividends, and to a lesser extent, stock repurchases, whereas many top growth stocks have compelling opportunities in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, robotics, e-commerce, media, networking, electronics, and more. These end markets have been lucrative for companies that can allocate capital effectively and innovate.\nAmazon is famous for taking cash flow and plowing it back into growth initiatives. Amazon's track record is riddled with failures, but also major successes -- such as becoming the market leader in cloud computing and continuing to expand its e-commerce empire. By investing in ideas and maintaining a strong balance sheet, Amazon can afford to take risks and ride out downturns. Investors aren't always happy with this risk-taking, as Amazon fell 25% or more from its all-time high three times in the last 10 years (February 2016, December 2018, and over 55% in December 2022). In sum, the price for outsized gains is often high volatility, which can work in favor of risk-tolerant investors with long-term time horizons.\nThe Growth ETF remains a top buy now\nThere's no guarantee that the Vanguard Growth ETF will continue to outperform the S&P 500, but it has been one of the simplest ways to beat the index.\nThe outperformance hasn't been a fluke, as the index bets big on leading companies that pour resources into growing their future earnings rather than directly returning capital to shareholders. That strategy should continue to produce solid gains over the long term, but investors may want to temper their expectations in the near term, given elevated valuations.\nI expect the Vanguard Growth ETF to outperform the S&P 500 ETF over the next decade, making it a more attractive option for long-term investors. However, the Growth ETF could easily underperform the S&P 500 over the short term, so it's only worth approaching the fund if you have the time horizon needed to endure volatility."

      "text": "When it comes to the major U.S. stock indexes, the S&P 500 index is considered the best gauge of the overall stock market's performance and an indicator of how large U.S. corporations are performing.\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s what all investors should know about the S&P 500 index, how it works, how you can invest in it, and why doing so could be a smart move.\nWhat is the S&P 500 index?\nWhat is the S&P 500 index?\nThe S&P 500 (also known as the Standard & Poor's 500) is a registered trademark of the joint venture S&P Dow Jones Indices. It is a stock index that consists of the 500 largest companies in the U.S. and is generally considered the best indicator of how U.S. stocks are performing overall.\nIn simple terms, the S&P 500 is a measure of the performance of America's 500 largest stocks. For this reason, the S&P 500 is a common benchmark against which portfolio performance can be evaluated.\nThe S&P 500 index is weighted by market capitalization, which means that larger companies make up more of the index's performance. Each listed company doesn't simply represent 1/500th of the index. Massive companies such as Apple (AAPL -0.17%) and Amazon (AMZN 2.93%) have a greater impact on the S&P 500 index than relatively smaller companies like General Motors (GM 1.65%).\nOne key point is that, although these are 500 large companies, there's a wide range of valuations. The largest companies in the index have market caps in excess of $3 trillion. This is more than 200 times larger than the smallest S&P 500 companies, which have market caps of less than $10 billion.\nWhy use it?\nWhy use the S&P 500?\nYou may be wondering why the S&P 500 is considered so useful as a market and economic indicator. Because the S&P 500 consists of a broad basket of stocks without too many small or obscure companies, it contains the companies most widely owned by individual investors. In fact, the 500 companies account for roughly 80% of the overall value of the stock market in the U.S.\nCompany weighting formula and calculation\nThe weighting formula for S&P 500 stocks is fairly straightforward. First, the company's market cap is determined by multiplying each company's outstanding share count by its current share price.\nNext, the market caps of all S&P 500 components are added together. Each company's market cap is then divided by the total to determine its weight in the index. For example, if the combined market cap of all S&P 500 companies is $40 trillion and one company has a $1 trillion market cap, it would make up 2.5% of the index by weight.\nWhich companies are in the S&P 500 index?\nThe S&P 500 index is composed of 503 stocks issued by 500 different companies. There's a difference in numbers because a few S&P 500 component companies issue more than one class of stock. For example, Alphabet Class C (GOOG 0.46%) and Alphabet Class A (GOOGL 0.53%) stock are both included in the S&P 500 index.\nObviously, it wouldn't be practical to list all of the S&P 500 companies here. But because the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, its performance is mostly driven by the performances of the stocks of the largest companies.\nWith that in mind, here's a look at the 10 largest companies of the S&P 500 index as of June 23, 2025. This list and its sequence can, and probably will, change over time.\n- Microsoft (MSFT 0.46%)\n- Nvidia (NVDA 0.28%)\n- Apple (AAPL -0.17%)\n- Amazon (AMZN 2.93%)\n- Alphabet (GOOGL 0.53%) (GOOG 0.46%)\n- Meta Platforms (META 0.28%)\n- Broadcom (AVGO 0.76%)\n- Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.4%)(BRK.B 0.37%)\n- Tesla (TSLA -1.0%)\n- JPMorgan Chase (JPM 1.25%)\nData source: Dow Jones S&P Indexes.\nSP 500 vs. others\nS&P 500 vs. other major indexes\nAlthough the S&P 500 is widely regarded as the best gauge of how the U.S. stock market is doing, there are several other indexes that can be useful for investors as well, including:\n- Dow Jones Industrial Average\n- Nasdaq Composite\n- Russell 2000 (small-cap index)\nS&P 500 vs. Dow Jones Industrial Average\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted index, meaning that the companies with the highest stock prices have the most influence on the index regardless of their valuations. The Dow only lists 30 companies and excludes some of the largest stocks in the market -- for example, Amazon, Alphabet, and Berkshire Hathaway.\nBecause the Dow is price-weighted, Goldman Sachs (GS 0.34%), with a nearly $650 share price currently, has more than six times as much influence over the Dow's performance as Walmart (WMT -0.08%), despite Goldman's market cap being roughly one-fourth of Walmart's.\nFor these reasons, the S&P 500 is considered by most experts to be a better stock market indicator.\nS&P 500 vs. the Nasdaq\nThe obvious difference between the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index is that stocks in the latter must be listed exclusively on the Nasdaq market. The S&P 500 is a mix of both Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks. The Nasdaq has a higher proportion of technology stocks than the broader market, so it is more of a tech-heavy index. You may notice that when tech stocks are underperforming, the Nasdaq Composite tends to underperform the S&P 500 as well.\nAnother key difference is that while the S&P 500 consists of large-cap stocks, the Nasdaq Composite contains all qualified stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange, so it's more diverse in terms of the market caps represented.\nS&P 500 vs. the Russell Indexes\nThe Russell Indexes are designed to provide benchmarks for the entire stock market. The Russell 1000 is the closest comparison to the S&P 500 since it's a large-cap stock index that consists of 1,000 stocks (twice as many as the S&P 500) and is representative of about 93% of the stock market.\nThere is also the more popular Russell 2000 index, which is considered to be the best benchmark of how small-cap U.S. stocks are doing. Collectively, the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are known as the Russell 3000, which is a total stock market benchmark index.\nHow to invest in it\nHow can you invest in the S&P 500 index?\nYou can invest in the S&P 500 index by purchasing shares of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that passively tracks the index. These investment vehicles own all the stocks in the S&P 500 index in proportional weights.\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.09%), which trades just like a stock, and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (NASDAQMUTFUND:VFIAX) mutual fund are two attractive options. Both have extremely low fees and deliver virtually identical performance as the S&P 500 index over time.\nIn addition, you can buy S&P 500 futures, which trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, although this is a far more complex way to invest than simply buying an index fund. These are essentially options that enable hedging or speculating on the index's future value.\nRelated investment topics\nIs this investment for you?\nIs investing in the S&P 500 right for you?\nLegendary stock market investor Warren Buffett has famously said that a low-cost S&P 500 index fund is the best investment that most people can make. It\u2019s not difficult to see why. Over long periods, the S&P 500 has delivered annualized total returns of 9% to 10%, and you can easily invest in a passive S&P 500 fund with virtually no investment fees.\nIf you have the time, knowledge, and desire to properly research stocks and maintain a portfolio, it\u2019s certainly possible over the long term to achieve superior investment returns relative to the S&P 500. However, not everyone has the time and discipline needed to invest in stocks that way, and newer investors especially may be better off buying shares in an S&P 500 index fund until they build up their knowledge.\nInvesting in the S&P 500 is a way to get broad exposure to the profitability of U.S. businesses without too much exposure to any individual company\u2019s performance. Over time, the S&P 500 can produce strong returns for your portfolio with minimal effort on your part.\nFAQs\nS&P 500 FAQs\nWhat is the S&P 500?\nThe S&P 500 (also known as the Standard & Poor's 500), a registered trademark of the joint venture S&P Dow Jones Indices, is a stock index that consists of the 500 largest companies in the U.S. It is generally considered the best indicator of how U.S. stocks are performing overall. From another angle, the S&P 500, as an index, is a statistical measure of the performance of America's 500 largest stocks. In this context, the S&P 500 is a common benchmark against which portfolio performance can be evaluated.\nWhat are stock market indexes?\nA stock market index shows how investors feel an economy is faring. An index collects data from a variety of companies across industries. Together, that data forms a picture that helps investors compare current price levels with past prices to calculate market performance. Some indexes focus on a smaller subset of the market. For example, the Nasdaq index has a high concentration in technology stocks. So, if you want to know how technology is performing, you\u2019d want to look at the Nasdaq stock index.\nWhat is the Nasdaq Composite Index?\nThe Nasdaq Composite is a stock market index that consists of the stocks that are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. To be included in the index:\n- A stock must be listed exclusively on the Nasdaq market.\n- The stock must be a common stock of an individual company, so preferred stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other types of securities are excluded.\n- American depositary receipts (ADRs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and shares of limited partnerships are eligible, however.\nThat's why there are so many stocks included in the Nasdaq Composite and why the number of stocks in the index changes often. The index is designed to be representative of the entire Nasdaq stock market, not just the largest companies."

      "text": "Microsoft (MSFT 0.46%) has been a standout growth stock in 2025, adding more than $830 billion in market cap from the start of the year through the end of July. But some investors may be concerned that Microsoft is running up too far too fast, setting the stage for a pullback due to valuation concerns.\nHere's why Microsoft's valuation is pretty much the only thing holding it back from being a screaming buy, and why the company can grow into its valuation over time.\nMicrosoft and the effectiveness of consistent compounding\nMicrosoft is a textbook example of the power of compounding solid growth over an extended period.\nOver the last decade, cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) have been the two biggest drivers of Microsoft's sales and earnings growth. An honorable mention is the vertical integration of Microsoft's gaming business (under its More Personal Computing segment) through Xbox, content services, and the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nOver the last decade, Microsoft's revenue more than tripled, and its net income is up more than sixfold. The company generated more net income in fiscal 2025 than revenue in fiscal 2017 -- illustrating the impact of high-margin growth on Microsoft's bottom line.\n|\nFiscal Year |\n2016 |\n2017 |\n2018 |\n2019 |\n2020 |\n2021 |\n2022 |\n2023 |\n2024 |\n2025 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\nRevenue (billions) |\n$85.3 |\n$90 |\n$110.4 |\n$125.8 |\n$143 |\n$168.1 |\n$198.3 |\n$211.9 |\n$245.1 |\n$281.7 |\n|\nNet income (billions) |\n$16.8 |\n$21.2 |\n$16.6 |\n$39.2 |\n$44.3 |\n$69.9 |\n$72.7 |\n$72.4 |\n$88.1 |\n$101.8 |\n|\nNet profit margin |\n19.7% |\n23.6% |\n15% |\n31.2% |\n31% |\n41.6% |\n36.7% |\n34.2% |\n35.9% |\n36.1% |\nMicrosoft has been consistently growing revenue, but net income is growing even faster. In fiscal 2025, Microsoft raked in around $0.36 of every dollar in revenue into bottom-line profit. That's profit net of all expenses -- including taxes. That's an incredible achievement, especially considering how much Microsoft's expenses have gone up in recent years.\nMicrosoft is relatively expensive\nMicrosoft's rapid growth in the second half of the 2010s was driven by Azure and the widespread adoption of cloud computing. But everything has been clicking for Microsoft over the last three years. The company grew revenue by roughly 15% in fiscal 2023, 2024, and now 2025 -- surpassing $100 billion net income for a fiscal year for the first time in company history.\nMicrosoft's stock price responded to these impeccable results by compounding several-fold. And for a while, the valuation was arguably too cheap to ignore.\nBut now, Microsoft is being valued for what it has become, which is an ultra-high-margin, diversified business growing revenue in the mid-teens rather than the high single digits or low teens of years past. This valuation expansion has pushed Microsoft's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio close to 40 -- whereas its 10-year median P/E is 33.1.\nGrowing into its valuation\nMicrosoft has never been a better company, but it has also become a much more expensive stock. Over time, Microsoft has justified its high valuation by consistently growing revenue and earnings. And now more than ever there's reason to believe that can continue.\nAnything can happen in the stock market in the short term. But when it comes to long-term investing, buying ultra-high-quality companies at premium prices is usually worth it.\nAs an example, if Microsoft keeps growing earnings at 15% per year, earnings will double in five years.\nIf the stock price did nothing over that period, the P/E would be cut in half, down to around 20.\nIf the stock price gained another 50%, the P/E would fall to 30 -- a discount to Microsoft's historical average.\nJustifying a premium price\nMicrosoft won't look expensive if it keeps up this pace of earnings growth. The power of compound returns is why the market is willing to pay a high price for Microsoft today.\nAs an individual investor, you have the luxury of choosing whether to agree with a prevailing sentiment. Right now, the sentiment is optimistic on Microsoft. So to buy the stock requires a long-term time horizon and the conviction that the optimism is grounded in logic rather than greed.\nBut if you believe that a lot of Microsoft's growth is due to a surge in AI adoption that will cool off as the technology becomes widespread, then it's perfectly all right to take a wait-and-see approach to the stock."

      "text": "On July 9, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) became the first company to reach $4 trillion in market cap. But Nvidia's stint as the lone company on the $4 trillion podium wouldn't last.\nA scorching rally, followed by blowout earnings report and guidance, springboarded Microsoft (MSFT 0.46%) above $4 trillion on July 31 -- making these two tech giants the undisputed heavyweight champs in the age of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAs of market close on July 31, Microsoft was up 26.9% year to date compared to a 7.8% gain in the S&P 500. Microsoft had dropped out of the $4 trillion club by Monday morning, but I'm sure it will get back there. Here are three reasons Microsoft deserves to be in the $4 trillion club and why it could still be a growth stock worth buying now.\n1. Entering a new growth gear\nExpectations were high for Microsoft's final quarter of fiscal 2025.\nThree months ago, the tech giant delivered fantastic results and updated its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, calling for a 13.8% increase in full-year revenue. Not only did Microsoft surpass that target with 15% full-year revenue growth, but it also boosted margins and earnings.\nMicrosoft finished the fiscal year with a 45.6% operating margin and a 36.1% profit margin -- meaning it is converting $0.36 of every dollar in revenue into net income.\nIt's also worth mentioning that Microsoft hasn't been relying on acquisitions to fuel its higher numbers. Rather, it has been expanding its core business segments -- which tends to be a better path to earnings growth because it shows the underlying business is strong and doesn't need to pay for innovation by acquiring talent and ideas.\n2. Microsoft is innovating\nGrowing sales at 15% is impressive on its own for a company the size of Microsoft. But doing so while also expanding margins is a testament to Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, where Microsoft is experiencing high-margin growth fueled by AI.\nAzure surpassed $75 billion in fiscal-year revenue as Microsoft continues building more data centers. On the earnings call on July 30, Microsoft said it continues to lead the AI infrastructure wave and now operates more data centers than any other cloud provider.\nMicrosoft is building larger and more efficient data centers that can handle AI workloads. It is developing tools that are advancing its AI offerings, such as Microsoft Sovereign Cloud for public and private clouds and data and analytics platform Microsoft Fabric, and also pushing forward long-term bets on quantum computing.\nOutside cloud services, Microsoft Copilot continues to expand -- surpassing 100 million monthly active users. On the earnings call, Microsoft discussed how some companies initially tried out Copilot and have since expanded their orders to the enterprise level. The rapid adoption reflects the fact that Copilot is becoming an everyday tool for Microsoft 365 users.\nMicrosoft is unique because it is developing entirely new tools for AI-specific workflows, but it is also upgrading legacy software, like Microsoft 365, to make it more powerful. Innovating while improving core aspects of the existing business has given Microsoft impressive results, and it's why the company is growing revenue and margins quickly despite tough comps.\n3. Investments are paying off\nMicrosoft's earnings growth hasn't come cheap. The company has been pouring resources into research and development, capital expenditures (capex), and operating expenses, and it has seen a surge in stock-based compensation. But Microsoft has been able to make these investments pay off.\nToo often, companies will enter a period of expansion, get greedy, and throw resources at ideas that end up being money pits. This position can amplify losses during a downturn. For example, Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) vertical integration created a more capital-intensive business model. Failing to keep pace with competition that was adopting new semiconductor technology to pack more transistors onto smaller chips led to Intel's falling even further behind.\nRamping up capex on its own isn't good enough. A company must invest in the right ideas and make those ideas benefit the underlying business over the long term, not just result in temporary earnings spikes.\nMicrosoft is putting on a clinic in capital allocation without neglecting its financial health.\nFor example, in fiscal 2025, Microsoft finished with $11.9 billion more in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet than at the end of fiscal 2024 -- and that's despite growing its expenses and dividend. However, free cash flow grew at 10% compared to 15% growth in operating cash flow as a result of higher capex.\nMicrosoft is guiding for $30 billion in capex in its current quarter. For context, capex in its latest quarter was $24.2 billion.\nIn sum, Microsoft has so far been able to convert record spending into record earnings, which is driving its record stock price. But the pace of its capex spending is entering uncharted waters, which will put more pressure on Microsoft to deliver results.\nMicrosoft's run-up is justified\nWall Street has been rewarding companies delivering AI-driven growth, and Microsoft has been at the forefront of that wave. Microsoft's blowout quarter and guidance suggest that it is pushing even harder on long-term investments -- but it can afford to do so, as evidenced by its rock-solid balance sheet. It continues to grow earnings faster than revenue, meaning that Microsoft isn't compromising efficiency in the pursuit of revenue growth.\nMicrosoft has done a masterful job allocating capital. Until that changes, Microsoft will likely remain a Wall Street darling. But if it starts showing signs of failing to convert that spending into earnings, it wouldn't surprise me to see the stock sell off.\nAll told, Microsoft is still worth buying and holding for investors who agree with its aggressive approach to AI and are willing to accept its higher valuation."

      "text": "Investors love categorizing companies. There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META 0.28%)), Amazon (AMZN 2.93%), Netflix (NFLX 2.17%), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOG 0.46%) (GOOGL 0.53%)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (AAPL -0.17%).\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NVDA 0.28%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.46%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA -1.00%).\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (AVGO 0.76%), Oracle (ORCL 0.29%), and Netflix.\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\nThe Broadcom blunder\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market."

      "text": "Forward P/E is a valuation metric that uses earnings forecasts to calculate the ratio of the share price to projected earnings per share. The \"P\" in forward P/E stands for price, or share price. The \"E\" stands for future earnings per share.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is forward P/E?\nForward P/E is a variation of the price-to-earnings ratio that uses an estimate of earnings over the next 12 months to calculate the metric. Unlike the trailing P/E, which uses actual earnings results from the previous 12 months, the forward P/E is based on estimates, and is therefore subject to errors in forecasting.\nTo combat the potential to get the estimated earnings wrong, the forward P/E is typically calculated using a consensus estimate from all analysts who have published their expectations. This wisdom of the crowd approach typically leads to more accurate estimates.\nHow to calculate it\nHow to calculate forward P/E\nThe formula for calculating a forward P/E ratio is very straightforward.\nForward P/E = Current share price / Estimated future earnings per share\nThe hard part is determining the estimated earnings per share. Several resources provide consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts for big companies. Some companies, however, only have a few analysts (and sometimes none) publishing estimates. In those cases it may be worthwhile to dig into the company financials, management\u2019s commentary, and build your own estimate to aggregate with the professionals.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say a stock currently trades for around $150 per share. Analysts expect it\u2019ll produce earnings per share of $6 over the next year. That stock has a forward P/E ratio of 25.\nHow to use it\nHow to use forward P/E\nCalculating the forward P/E of a stock isn\u2019t very useful in and of itself. To get something out of it, you need to calculate the forward P/E of other comparable stocks.\nComparing the forward P/E of two or more companies within the same industry can give you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If one stock has a P/E far greater than its peers, the stock might not be a very good deal.\nBut there are good reasons why a stock may have a high forward P/E. If analysts expect that company\u2019s earnings per share to grow significantly faster than its peers, it\u2019ll value the next 12 months of earnings far higher than a slow-growing company. That\u2019s because a stock price reflects all the future cash flows of a business, not just the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s important to consider that a forward P/E uses earnings per share, or EPS, in the denominator. EPS is itself a ratio, which is affected by the number of shares outstanding. So, if a company has plans to buy back a large percentage of its shares outstanding through a share repurchase program, investors may be willing to pay more for its earnings today.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations of forward P/E\nTo calculate a price-to-earnings ratio, a company needs to have earnings. But not every company produces positive earnings for its shareholders.\nEarly-stage growth companies often produce losses, but their operations show strong potential for earnings at some point in the future. While they invest to grow the business, leverage their fixed operating expenses, and move toward profitability, their stocks technically trade for a negative P/E ratio.\nProfit\nEven when those companies start to make a profit, their relatively minuscule profits relative to the number of shares outstanding can lead to P/E ratios with triple or even quadruple digits. Those valuations aren\u2019t useful for an investing thesis, and forward P/E falls flat in those cases.\nInvestors will be better off finding a different valuation metric to compare growth stocks that are still generating losses for investors. Just because they have extremely high or non-existent forward P/E ratios doesn\u2019t make them bad investments."
