  "description": "Cool down from up to 70 feet away with this rechargeable indoor-outdoor fan with Instacool misting now that it's at an all-time low price at Amazon.",
  "content": "Want to talk about rapid evolution? You don\u2019t have to be that old to remember when turning on a fan to cool down meant turning the switch on a simple box fan. One propeller, three speeds, and the only other feature is that it makes your voice sound funny if you talk into it. Fast-forward to today and behold the Shark FlexBreeze pedestal and tabletop oscillating fan, which is at its lowest price ever right now at Amazon, just $130.\n\nThe list of the Shark FlexBreeze\u2019s features is pretty incredible, and this 35% off Amazon deal is arriving just in time as an August heat wave settles in across much of the country. The Shark FlexBreeze\u2019s cooling breeze can be felt from as far away as 70 feet, and when you use the Instacool misting attachment, that breeze can make you feel up to 10 degrees cooler. It has a separate pedestal pole and base to toggle between floor and tabletop use, it\u2019s UV- and water-resistant for outdoor use, and when you take it outside you don\u2019t have to worry about running an extension cord, because it has a rechargeable battery with a 24-hour runtime.\n\nThe Shark FlexBreeze weighs just 13 pounds, and has a built-in handle that is key to expanding the FlexBreeze from tabletop to floor fan and back again, and also to carry the fan anywhere you need it \u2014 indoors or outdoors. Yet despite its relatively small size and sleek design, the FlexBreeze packs a tremendous cooling punch. Put it in BreezeBoost mode and you can feel the air moving from up to 70 feet away. And even with that kind of power, the Shark FlexBreeze is amazingly quiet, so you can run it while you\u2019re working or sleeping without interruption.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the amazing cooling power of a misting fan, they\u2019ve long been the key to allowing outdoor eating and other activities in places like Phoenix and Las Vegas during the brutal summer months. Add the Instacool misting attachment to the FlexBreeze and bring that simple yet effective technology wherever you need it \u2014 the mist cools you by as much as 10 degrees without getting you even a little bit damp.\n\nThe Shark FlexBreeze\u2019s rechargeable battery has a robust 24 hour runtime, and if it begins to run down or if you don\u2019t necessarily need to go wireless, it also plugs in so it can run while recharging the battery. Bring it outside and fire up the misting attachment without fear of damage \u2014 the FlexBreeze is UV- and water-resistant.\n\nThe Shark FlexBreeze could be the most innovative and versatile fan we\u2019ve seen in a long time, and it could be an essential addition to your home during the hottest days of summer which may yet to come. This Amazon limited-time deal is your big chance \u2014 it\u2019s the lowest price ever for the Shark FlexBreeze, just $130.",
