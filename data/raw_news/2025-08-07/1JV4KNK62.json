  "description": "Doehler Dry Ingredient Solutions issued a voluntary recall in July for a dried fruit pack due to potential listeria contamination.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nA recall of a dried fruit product due to potential listeria contamination has been issued the highest risk warning by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nDoehler Dry Ingredient Solutions, LLC, announced a voluntary recall on July 30 for it Freeze Dried Fruit Variety Pack, containing five strawberry pouches, five banana pouches, and five apple pouches. The FDA later issued a Class I risk classification for the recall on Wednesday.\n\nNewsweek contacted Doehler Dry Ingredient Solutions, LLC, for comment via its website outside of regular working hours.\n\nA Class I risk classification represents \"a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death,\" according to the FDA.\n\nListeria infection, or listeriosis, may lead to a range of symptoms in infected individuals. For those experiencing less severe infections, symptoms may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which often last between one and three days, the FDA said.\n\nFor more severe and potentially life-threatening infections, symptoms may include headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.\n\nSevere infections are particularly dangerous for young children, frail or elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems. It can also lead to miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe products affected by the recall include the following:\n\nThe products were sold in Sam's Club retail stores in 43 states and territories.\n\nThe affected items were shipped to distribution centers in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Wyoming.\n\nAs of July 31, no illnesses had been reported in connection with the consumption of the affected products.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nMary O'Riordan, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, told Newsweek previously: \"Listeria has an unusual capacity to grow at refrigerated temperatures. Although the bacterium can contaminate many types of food, cheeses or deli meats that are kept in cold storage for long periods in stores or at home are a place where listeria can keep growing.\n\n\"Early symptoms of listeria infection look similar to other common foodborne infections, including fever, diarrhea and vomiting, so it's often not diagnosed right away. Unfortunately, sometimes listeria can spread into the brain and cause more serious illness, like meningitis. In those cases, if people experience headache, stiff neck or confusion, they should seek urgent medical attention.\"\n\nHaley F. Oliver, a professor of food science at Purdue University, told Newsweek previously: \"Listeria monocytogenes is a common microorganism that can be found in the natural environment, for example in soil. There are many factors that determine if someone gets listeriosis\u2014a listeria infection. In most instances, an immunocompromised person\u2014so young, old, pregnant or otherwise immunocompromised\u2014must eat contaminated food. The number of bacteria resulting in infection and the amount of time before illness varies considerably. Symptoms vary among people but can include fever, flu-like symptoms, headache, stiff neck, confusion and loss of balance.\"\n\nThe FDA says on its website: \"Pregnant women and their unborn or newborn baby, adults over the age of 65, and those with weakened immune systems, are all considered to be high-risk groups that are susceptible to the serious and adverse effects of listeriosis.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe recall is listed as completed, according to the FDA.\n\nConsumers who purchased the recalled products should discard them or return them to Sam's Club for a full refund.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\nA recall of two sweetener products after a mislabeling error has been issued the second-highest risk warning by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nNuNaturals, Inc., based in Eugene, Oregon, initiated a voluntary recall for select lots of its Organic Pure Stevia and Pure Monk Fruit Sweetener on July 14. The FDA later issued a Class II risk classification for the recall on August 1.\nNewsweek contacted NuNaturals, Inc. for comment by email outside of regular working hours.\nWhy It Matters\nA Class II risk classification\u2014the second-highest of three classes\u2014refers to a situation in which the \"use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote,\" according to the FDA.\nIndividuals with allergies to ragweed and related plants may also be sensitive to stevia, according to WebMD. While monk fruit allergies are rare, they are still possible.\nAllergic reactions vary in severity from mild symptoms, such as hives and lip swelling, to life-threatening complications, such as anaphylaxis, that may include fatal respiratory problems.\nWhat To Know\nThe products impacted by the recall are the following:\n- Pure Monk Fruit Sweetener - 78 bottles - UPC 7 39223 00187 6 - best-by: April 2028 - Lot number: 25104S\n- Organic Pure Stevia - 78 bottles - UPC 7 39223 00204 0 - best-by: April 2028 - Lot number: 25104S\nThe bottles labeled as Pure Monk Fruit Sweetener in fact contained stevia powder. Meanwhile, the recalled Organic Pure Stevia bottles contained monk fruit, according to the FDA.\nThe products were distributed to retailers and consumers nationwide, according to the FDA. They were packaged in plastic bottles with white caps, weighing 0.71oz and 1oz.\nWhat People Are Saying\nThe FDA, on its website: \"People with food allergies should read labels and avoid the foods they are allergic to. The law requires that food labels identify the food source of all major food allergens used to make the food.\"\nIt adds: \"Food producers recall their products from the marketplace when the products are mislabeled or when the food may present a health hazard to consumers because the food is contaminated or has caused a foodborne illness outbreak.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe recall is listed as ongoing, according to the FDA.\nConsumers with allergies or sensitives to stevia, ragweed, related plants, and monk fruit should not consume the affected products.\nAbout the writer\nMatthew Robinson is the Newsweek U.S. News Editor based in London, U.K. His focus is U.S. politics and national news. ...

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the nine \"major\" food allergens in the U.S. are eggs, milk, fish, wheat, soybeans, Crustacean shellfish, sesame, tree nuts and peanuts.\nListeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that poses significant health risks, particularly to pregnant women, newborns, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems, according to the FDA.\nWhat To Know\nIn the alert, the FDA notes that the products were distributed from July 1, 2025, until July 25, 2025, at Sam's Club retail locations.\nThe states and territories impacted by this recall are:\n- Alabama\n- Arizona\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Connecticut\n- Delaware\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Hawaii\n- Iowa\n- Indiana\n- Illinois\n- Idaho\n- Kansas\n- Louisiana\n- Maryland\n- Maine\n- Mississippi\n- Minnesota\n- Missouri\n- Michigan\n- Montana\n- North Carolina\n- North Dakota\n- Nebraska\n- New Hampshire\n- New Jersey\n- New Mexico\n- Nevada\n- New York\n- Ohio\n- Oklahoma\n- Pennsylvania\n- South Carolina\n- South Dakota\n- Tennessee\n- Texas\n- Utah\n- Virginia\n- Wisconsin\n- West Virginia\n- Wyoming\n- Puerto Rico\nThe Member's Mark Freeze Dried Fruit Variety Pack's being recalled are in 15 count boxes with a UPC number of 1 93968 50900 2, the FDA said.

The average time from exposure to illness is approximately 30 days, but symptoms can appear as long as 90 days after exposure. It is important for consumers to know that the infection can occur as much as 90 days later, so that they can seek appropriate treatment if they have symptoms of Listeria infection.\"\nWhat Happens Next?\nConsumers are advised to contact Doehler Dry Ingredient Solutions, LLC's Customer Service via phone at (770) 387-0451 on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET with any additional questions, the FDA says.\nHealth authorities continue to emphasize the importance of proper food storage and handling, particularly for ready-to-eat items.

Inconsistencies may occur.\nA nationwide and cross-border recall of a popular relaxation tea, initiated after an ingredient mixup, has been designated by food inspectors as the second-highest risk level.\nHerbalife International of America, which is based in Los Angeles, issued a voluntary recall of its Relaxation Tea on July 21. The recall affects 5,888 products sold online across the United States as well as in Mexico and Ecuador.\nOn August 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified the recall as a Class II risk\u2014a designation indicating products may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences.\nNo press release was issued and the FDA's classification alert did not state which ingredients had been mixed up. Newsweek has contacted Herbalife via email outside of regular office hours on Thursday.\nWhy It Matters\nThe FDA's decision to classify the recall as a Class II risk signals a significant, though not life-threatening, potential for harm. Class II recalls address situations where the use of a product could cause temporary or medically reversible adverse effects, or the probability of serious consequences is remote.\nWhat To Know\nThe FDA said the recall stemmed from the use of an \"incorrect ingredient received from supplier and used in manufacturing finished product Relaxation Tea.\"\nThe items' lot code, which is often found near the product's bar code, is: D925507J02. The expiration date is 04/11/2027, the FDA alert said.\nHerbalife advised customers not to use the affected Relaxation Tea products.\nFDA inspectors assign recalls one of three classifications\u2014Class I, Class II, or Class III\u2014to indicate the degree of hazard to people's health. The classifications are defined by the agency as:\n- Class I - a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\n- Class II - a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\n- Class III - a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.\nWhat Happens Next\nConsumers who purchased Herbalife Relaxation Tea are urged to check their packaging and discontinue use of any recalled units. Customers with affected products or safety concerns are advised to contact Herbalife's customer service or review the FDA's recall posting for detailed guidance."
