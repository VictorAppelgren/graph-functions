      "feedback": "Strong draft overall, but to reach world‑class status you need (1) a clearly stated multi‑year regime map anchored in first principles, not just narrative: build invariant anchors (productivity gains from cloud/AI, capital returns, policy reaction functions) and define regimes and transition conditions; reference the cloud/AI mega‑trend (0G3A676BP) and Grand View Research’s 21.2% cloud CAGR to 2030, plus the role of moats and cash flow (0G3A676BP), and tie them to a policy/FX/BoP framework where applicable; (2) a coherent causal chain from the invariants to market pricing, including how cloud/AI expansion, labor‑capital dynamics, and EV/tariff cycles alter discount rates, cash flow conversion, and ROIC, with explicit linkage to the cited sources (e.g., 0G3A676BP for cloud/AI growth, 4LQD15CFU for labor‑market strategy and JUST Capital signals, P0K0UEOHU for Rivian/Tesla policy risk, TN66GHPAT for Donegal DGICB context, JVKCZAPVG for the Gran Torino analogy); (3) a structured base case plus clearly defined catalysts/triggers and invalidation events: Regime triggers (cloud capex momentum, AI talent disclosure, EV tax credits/tariffs shifts, IBM/Salesforce hiring/layoff trajectories as per 4LQD15CFU and its sources), with specific milestones (Rivian EBITDA breakeven by 2027; Rivian R2 launch; Tesla robotaxi progress) drawn from P0K0UEOHU and 0G3A676BP; (4) crisp, numbers‑driven quantification rather than qualitative statements: quote and bracket ranges where possible (MSFT Q4 FY2025: revenue +18%, Azure +39% QoQ; cloud CAGR 21.2% to 2030; Rivian EBITDA breakeven 2027; DOE loan of $6.6B; R2 price around $45k; DGICB dividend yield drift; etc.), and present sensitivity tests around these levers; (5) rigorous coverage and conflict reconciliation: acknowledge competing narratives (e.g., Just Capital vs. BuzzFeed Costco imagery vs. HBR‑style labor research in 4LQD15CFU) and weight them, rather than cherry‑picking; (6) format and horizon alignment per SECTION FOCUS: deliver a Base Case, Key Risks, Things to Watch, and Confidence section, with short, regime‑specific causal chains and a one‑paragraph conclusion, ensuring every assertion maps to an ID in SOURCE MATERIAL (0G3A676BP, 4LQD15CFU, P0K0UEOHU, TN66GHPAT, JVKCZAPVG, etc.) and avoiding promotional framing (cut the Stock Advisor/pitch language); (7) tighten the prose for coherence: replace blended recap with discrete, testable hypotheses and a single cohesive narrative that reveals how each source underpins the regime premises, and add an explicit invalidation rule (e.g., if cloud growth slows below a threshold or EV credits are extended/shrunk).",
