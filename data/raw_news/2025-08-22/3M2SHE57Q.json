  "title": "Trump administration official says some CHIPS Act companies won't need to give up equity",
  "description": "Unlike Intel, TSMC will reportedly not have to give up any equity to the US government after receiving funds under the CHIPs Act.",
  "content": "Last week, the Trump administration said it might take a stake in Intel in exchange for the $10.86 billion in federal grants the company is receiving from the Chips and Science (CHIPS) Act. However, not all companies receiving funds under the same program will need to give up equity, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Companies like TSMC and Micron that increased their US investments won't have any additional obligations, according to a government official familiar with the matter.\n\nEalier, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick appeared to royally screw NVIDIA with comments about the company's H20 AI chips, and may have also rubbed chip giant TSMC the wrong way. \"The Biden administration literally was giving Intel [money] for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies, just giving them money for free,\" he told CNBC on Tuesday. \"Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money. If we\u2019re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.'\"\n\nHowever, TSMC may have noticed the Intel equity kerfuffle and executives reportedly held preliminary discussions about handing back subsidies if the US government asks to become a shareholder, according to the WSJ's sources. TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion for its Arizona plant that started producing chips late last year for Apple and others. However, the company recently said it would invest another $100 billion over the next four years to build three more fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and development center.\n\nBecause of that extra investment, the Trump administration won't ask for a piece of TSMC or Micron (which also expanded its US facilities in Idaho, New York and Virginia). \"The Commerce Department is not looking to take equity from TSMC and Micron,\" an unnamed official said.\n\nIn any case, attempts by the US government to take equity in companies will likely face legal challenges due to language in the contracts. Companies are already required to share revenue with the US government if profits rise above a certain amount.\n\nIn another development, the US government may divert up to $2 billion in CHIPS Act funding toward critical minerals projects in the US, Reuters reported. The move aims to reduce US dependence on China for key minerals extensively used in the electronics and defense industries. \"The administration is creatively trying to find ways to fund the critical minerals sector,\" Reuters' source said, adding that those plans could change.",

      "text": "China reportedly discouraged purchase of NVIDIA AI chips due to 'insulting' Lutnick statements\nHoward Lutnick previously said that the US wants China to keep using its fourth best AI chip.\nChinese regulators reportedly dissuaded local companies from purchasing NVIDIA's H20 chips, because they found certain statements by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" According to the Financial Times, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) teamed up to intensify their efforts to push the use of homegrown chips following Lutnick's remarks in an interview with CNBC.\nThe US, if you'll recall, blocked NVIDIA from selling its H20 chips to China back in April out of concern that the Chinese military would use them to develop AI technology. When the US government reversed its decision in July and allowed the company to start shipping its chips to China, Lutnick told CNBC: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. That's the thinking.\" To note, a previous Times report stated that the government allowed NVIDIA to ship its products to China again after agreeing to hand over 15 percent of its profits.\nAs a response to Lutnick's remarks, the Times says Chinese authorities sought ways to prevent local companies from buying H20 chips. CAC issued an informal notice instructing China's biggest tech firms, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop new orders for H20 chips until the government is done conducting a national security review. The companies are compelled to comply, because they could face substantial fines from the CAC if they don't. Meanwhile, NDRC also issued an informal notice, asking local tech companies not to purchase any NVIDIA chip.\nReuters recently reported that NVIDIA is developing a new chip for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, perhaps driven in part by China's move to discourage its purchase. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, but will only be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Their regulatory and export approval aren't guaranteed, but the president previously implied that he was aware of the project and said he expects NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to talk to him about it.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "Trump's administration may look to buy a stake in Intel\nA possible deal with the US government could boost the chipmaker's domestic manufacturing business.\nIntel has had some recent struggles in delivering results for its shareholders, but the company could soon be answering to an additional boss. The current administration is reportedly in talks to have the US government acquire a stake in the chipmaker. Bloomberg first reported the news without specifics about the size or value of the potential share the government wants to buy. According to a newer report by Bloomberg and The New York Times, the Trump administration is looking to take a 10 percent stake in Intel as part of its efforts to give domestic chip manufacturing a boost.\nThe administration is reportedly considering converting the $10.86 billion in federal grants Intel is getting from the US Chips and Science Act into equity instead. It's still early days, and the White House is still deciding on the exact size of the stake. Intel initially shared plans to construct a semiconductor facility in Ohio in 2022 while Pat Gelsinger was still at the helm of the company. Since then, the project has faced delays, and at its latest quarterly earnings report, execs said Intel would \"slow the pace\" on the Ohio construction, as well as scrapping other international building plans and making workforce cuts.\nThe potential for government ownership of Intel is the latest swing of the administration's attitude toward the company. A few days after calling for his resignation over connections to China, President Donald Trump met with CEO Lip-Bu Tan and seemed to now hold a more positive outlook on the company leader.\nA representative from Intel told Bloomberg in a statement that the company is \"deeply committed to supporting President Trump\u2019s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership. We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.\"\nUpdate, August 18 2025, 10:31AM ET: This story has been updated to include new reports that the Trump administration is looking to take a 10 percent stake in Intel."

The investment, equal to about 2% of Intel, makes SoftBank the fifth-biggest shareholder, according to FactSet.\nLutnick said any potential arrangement wouldn't provide the government with voting or governance rights in Intel.\n\"It's not governance, we're just converting what was a grant under Biden into equity for the Trump administration, for the American people,\" Lutnick said. \"Nonvoting.\"\nIntel declined to comment.\nLutnick also suggested that President Donald Trump could seek out similar deals with other CHIPS recipients.\nIntel said last fall that it had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant from the law to build its factories. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was awarded $6.6 billion under the legislation to boost chip fabrication at its Arizona facilities.\n'Silicon Heartland'\nTrump has called for more reshoring of U.S. manufacturing to reduce the country's reliance on companies like Samsung and TSMC to manufacture chips.\nIntel has been spending billions near Columbus, Ohio, to build a series of chip factories that the company previously called the \"Silicon Heartland.\" Intel has said that the factory complex would be able to produce the most advanced chips, including AI chips.\nBut in July, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a memo to employees that there would be \"no more blank checks,\" and that it was slowing down the construction of its Ohio factory complex, depending on market conditions.\nThe first factory is now scheduled to start operations in 2030.\nThe Ohio factory was one of the most public projects funded by the CHIPS and Science Act, which became law in 2022. The law committed the U.S. government to fund chip research and development and was estimated to cost about $53 billion.\n\"The Biden administration literally was giving Intel for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies just giving them money for free,\" Lutnick said. \"Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money. If we're going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.' \"\nIntel has struggled to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that's yet to secure a significant customer. Intel tapped Lip-Bu Tan to be its CEO in March after his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was ousted in December.\nTan met with Trump at the White House last week after the president called for his resignation, alleging he had ties to China.\n\u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."

      "text": "Apple expects to source over 19 billion chips from U.S. factories this year\nMany of them produced in Arizona.\nAlthough range-topping Apple processors are produced by TSMC in Taiwan, a lot of the chips that it uses inside its devices are made in the U.S. This year alone, Apple says it intends to source as many as 19 billion chips made in America \u2014 and tens of millions of them will be fabbed by TSMC in Arizona.\n\"During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year,\" said Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, during this week's earnings call with analysts and investors while describing Apple's manufacturing activities in America.\n\"We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company. All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the U.S. across all 50 states.\"\nFor now, TSMC's Fab 21 in Arizona will produce a fraction of the chips Apple uses in its products \u2014 tens of millions out of the 19 billion chips made in the U.S. But even tens of millions seems like a lot, considering Apple's latest devices use chips fabbed with 3nm-class process technologies, whereas Fab 21 produces chips on TSMC's 4nm and 5nm-class production nodes.\nApparently, Apple still has plenty of products that sell in the tens of millions that rely on 4nm and 5nm-class chips. Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that most of Apple's in-house designed processors will be made in Taiwan.\nThe key chips used by Apple inside its devices \u2014 such as system-on-chip (SoC) processors, memory, modems, and camera sensors \u2014 are produced by companies like TSMC, Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, and Sony in various Asian countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan.\nEach of Apple's devices contains dozens of humble ICs, however \u2014 amplifiers, power management ICs (PMICs), display drivers, radio front-end modules (FEMs), microcontrollers, retimers, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules, Ethernet controllers, and tens of others \u2014 that do not need the most advanced fabrication technologies, and which are made in the U.S. To that end, it is not surprising that Apple may be sourcing billions of chips made in the U.S. already.\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\nIn addition to sourcing chips from U.S. developers and manufacturers, Apple recently announced a commitment to invest $500 billion over the coming four years in its own facilities in America. This effort will involve scaling up operations and adding staff across multiple locations, such as Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. As part of this expansion, it will also be setting up a new facility in Texas that will produce its AI servers.\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

  "argos_summary": "The Trump administration is considering taking a 10% equity stake in Intel in exchange for $10.86 billion in federal grants under the CHIPS Act, a move that could boost domestic chip manufacturing. However, companies like TSMC and Micron, which have increased their U.S. investments, will not face similar equity demands. Meanwhile, comments from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick regarding NVIDIA's AI chips have reportedly led to Chinese regulators discouraging local companies from purchasing them, as they found his remarks insulting.",
