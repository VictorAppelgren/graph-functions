  "description": "When it's too hot to grill, the almighty air fryer steps in to help cook dinner without overheating the house.",
  "content": "I love my grill, but standing over blazing flames in 90-degree weather isn't my idea of summer fun. Cooking indoors isn't much better -- the oven turns the whole house into a sauna, and firing up the gas range with the windows closed can hurt indoor air quality.\n\nThat's where the air fryer comes in. These compact powerhouses cook quickly while using far less energy than a traditional oven, making them a perfect heat wave solution. Sure, they give off a little warmth, but nothing like a wall oven. Plus, most air fryer recipes are done in a fraction of the time, so you can get back to relaxing faster.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, I ran tests to see how much an air fryer would warm my kitchen compared to cooking them same food in an oven. The results cemented the air fryer as one of the best summer kitchen tools, right up there with ice makers and blenders.\n\nA heat wave requires creative thinking to keep the home cool and an air fryer is my ticket to getting through those sweltering summer spells without starving. To see if air fryers belong in the summer cooking hall of fame, I ran tests to see how much the oven heats up the kitchen versus an air fryer.\n\nI ran tests to see how much hotter an oven would make the kitchen\n\nTo find real-world differences, I roasted chicken thighs in my KitchenAid wall oven (less than 10 years old) and a 4-quart Dreo air fryer, according to two popular recipes from a well-known cooking site. I tested the temperature before, during and after to see how much of a difference each machine makes.\n\nMy Brooklyn apartment kitchen is on the small side, but it's not enclosed and opens up to the rest of the apartment. I kept the windows closed for the test, although it's worth noting that recent studies show cooking with natural gas in an enclosed kitchen can be a health risk.\n\nThe standard oven recipe called for the chicken to be roasted at 375 degrees for 30 minutes in the oven. Because of its smaller chamber, the air fryer recipe only required 20 minutes of cooking at the same temperature. The air fryer requires only about a minute to come to temperature, while the oven takes more than five.\n\nI placed a standard ambient thermometer in the middle of the kitchen -- about 5 feet from the stove -- at counter height. I took a reading before the oven or air fryer was turned on. I took another reading halfway through the cooking time and the last one at the end of the cooking time. Between the two sessions, I waited for the kitchen to return to a resting temperature before starting the next one.\n\nThe oven made my kitchen 10 degrees hotter than the air fryer\n\nMidway through the recipes (15 minutes), the oven raised the temperature of my kitchen by 15 degrees from 71 F to too-hot 88 F. After 10 minutes of cooking with the air fryer on 375 F, the temperature in my kitchen had gone up only 5 degrees F, from 72 F to a pleasant 77 F. You can feel heat emanating from the air fryer if you stand close enough, but it's not enough to significantly change the temperature of the kitchen.\n\nRead more: Here's How to Keep Your Kitchen Cool (and Lower Your Energy Bill) During a Heat Wave\n\nNot only did the air fryer cause less of a temperature spike, but I only needed to have it running for roughly 20 minutes with one minute of preheat time. The oven took 30 minutes to cook the chicken and 6 minutes to preheat.\n\nUsing the air fryer will cut down on energy bills\n\nDuring a heat wave, your air conditioner is already working hard. Heating the kitchen up with your oven will only require them to work harder, using more energy to bring the room back down to your desired temperature. For the AC to make up the difference for one 20- or 30-minute cooking session with an oven, it may not be a total budget-buster. Spread that out over time or for longer cooking sessions and using the oven during hot months can have real fiscal ramifications. For more on this, read my breakdown of exactly how much more an oven costs to run than an air fryer.\n\nWhat can you make in an air fryer?\n\nAn air fryer can do almost any cooking job that an oven can, although air fryers are typically smaller than wall ovens so you can't cook as much in one go.\n\nI've been tinkering with the air fryer a lot this year. I discovered the joy of cooking whole chickens in the air fryer, filets of salmon and even bacon cheeseburgers. The air fryer goes well beyond its reputation for cooking crispy wings and french fries. You can make dinner party-level recipes in the air fryer without breaking a sweat, literally.\n\nHere are seven foods that I only make in the air fryer now not just because they keep my kitchen cooler but because the results are as good or better than other methods.

      "text": "I'm no air fryer rookie -- I've crisped, roasted and reheated just about everything in my beloved countertop convection oven, but I held off on burgers for one reason: I wasn't convinced it could deliver that perfect medium-rare magic like a grill or cast-iron pan. Turns out, I was wrong.\nIf your backyard's missing a Weber -- and the smoky sizzle of burgers -- you're not out of luck. You can whip up juicy cheeseburgers, turkey patties and veggie stacks without ever stepping outside. One of my favorite tricks? Letting the air fryer do the heavy lifting.\nAfter air-frying a burger -- bacon, bun and all -- I am happy to report that making a bacon cheeseburger in an apartment-friendly air fryer is fast, clean and, as I found out recently, nets an equally juicy burger.\nPlus, you can easily get your air fryer burger medium rare via the super-convection heat that crisps the outside of food quickly without overcooking the inside.\nHere's how to make a bacon cheeseburger in your air fryer at home.\nHow to make a cheeseburger in your air fryer\nI consulted a variety of different sources for timings and temperatures, but the process is about what you'd expect and similar to that which you'd experience cooking a burger in any manner: flipping the patty about halfway through for even results, with different timings depending on the size of your desired doneness.\nRead more: How to Tell When Steak Is Perfectly Cooked Without a Thermometer\nThe air fryer works by circulating hot air in its contained chamber, so as a matter of interest, your air fryer burger will cook opposite to what you'd see on a saut\u00e9 pan, with the exposed side of the burger cooking more quickly and becoming browner than the underside of the patty.\nI tried two approaches, both with a quarter pound of lean ground beef, seasoned simply with salt and pepper.\nAir fryer cheeseburger recipe\n- Shape a single patty of beef about three-quarters of an inch in thickness.\n- Place in a greased air fryer basket and cooked at 370 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes, flipping at the halfway mark.\n- With about 2 minutes to go, add cheese to top of burger patty and place bun into air fryer basket to toast.\n- Remove all ingredients and build burger on bun with toppings of your choice.\n- Serve.\nI also tried the same amount of meat shaped into two, thin, smash-style patties for a total cooking time of about six minutes. (Double your cheeseburger, double your fun.)\nAir fryers require very little cleanup\nWell, that was easy. In both cases the patties cooked evenly, with an outcome that was medium in doneness. (You can easily experiment with your model and ideal burger patty size to find the precise timings for your preferred degree of doneness.) The hot air circulation even managed to produce a bit of caramelized crust on one side. Because I could, even with a small, single-household air fryer, I put in a couple of strips of bacon with the single burger patty, since crispy, spatter-free bacon is another excellent use for an air fryer -- not to mention an exceptional burger topping.\nSpeaking of spatter-free, this is the single most compelling reason to employ the air fryer for burger prep. Your clothing, skin and stovetop all avoid the sizzling oil droplets that -- safely contained within the air fryer drawer -- like to escape the pan during regular skillet cooking. The smoky, greasy, meaty aroma, which is otherwise appealing at a burger dive, but not so much in a studio apartment, is also minimized. Cleanup was limited only to the nonstick, air fryer drawer.\nRead more: I've Been Making Bacon Wrong. Here's the Best (and Cleanest) Way to Cook it\nThere are drawbacks to air fryer burgers\nThe air fryer isn't perfect when it comes to burgers, and the drawbacks as I experienced are twofold. First, since you can't really access the patty while it cooks, you're unable to smash it down in such a way that it doesn't shrink up significantly while cooking. Since an English muffin is the best burger containment method -- I will not be considering opposing viewpoints at this time -- this didn't bother me so much, since the resulting patty fits the intended vessel perfectly. Expect shrinkage when considering the size of your patty before cooking.\nSecond, if you're like me and believe that a burger without cheese isn't worth eating, things get a little more complicated. Because of the air circulation action of the air fryer, it's hard to anchor cheese on top for a quick melt at the end of the process. My first attempt with a sliced single, an ideal burger cheese -- and I am a cheese pro, so don't come at me -- flew off and unhelpfully adhered to the surface of the air fryer drawer.\nMy second attempt where a slice was halved and layered for extra heft was more successful, even more so when I moved the patties to the back edge of the fryer basket, which gets less aggressive air circulation. This may just be a quirk of my model, but I'd be prepared to experiment. I wouldn't even consider shredded cheese on top of a patty, but I absolutely would consider a cheese-stuffed burger, which should work nicely."

      "text": "Earlier this week, the Department of Energy announced new energy-efficiency guidelines for gas and electric stoves that \"make modest improvements.\" Approximately 97% of existing gas stoves on the market already meet the new standards, so they will have minimal impact on both consumers and kitchen appliance makers.\nThe new measures, which go into effect in 2028, address the environmental impact of natural gas stove use (although it's unclear how much of an impact they will have) but do nothing to address the growing concerns over potential health risks associated with the popular large appliances.\nAre natural gas stoves safe? What can be done to protect yourself from harmful toxins caused by a leaky gas stove? We'll try to answer both questions to help you mitigate risk for your home and family.\nAre gas stoves safe?\nWhile more research is needed, two recent studies have shown that natural gas stoves leak more than was previously known and that leaked gas poses a bigger long-term health threat, particularly to the respiratory health of children (more on that below).\nThe conversation around gas stove safety reached a fever pitch in January 2023 when Richard Trumka, an official with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, hinted in an interview with Bloomberg that natural gas stoves could be banned if found to be dangerous.\nTrumka has since walked back the comments following a maelstrom of backlash. While the CPSC has not made any formal statements about natural gas stoves being unsafe, there is mounting evidence to the contrary.\nAs many as 40% of stoves in the US run on natural gas. In its unburned state, natural gas contains harmful air toxins, including benzene, a chemical linked to cancer, and methane, which is harmful to the environment. In theory, natural gas' harmful toxins are eliminated during combustion, but last year's Harvard study proved stoves often leak the toxic unburned gas when not in use. The study also found that the odorants added to natural gas to help people detect leaks were done inconsistently, making it harder to catch a gas leak using your nose.\nAnother study from December 2022 showed that US homes with natural gas stoves had 13% more instances of childhood asthma. The number was even higher in certain states, including Illinois, New York and California.\nA leaky gas stove is often more dangerous in winter\nThe dangers of gas stoves are heightened during colder months when most of us keep windows closed, making kitchens more difficult to ventilate.\nThere are simple ways to prevent and detect dangerous air quality conditions and keep yourself safe. Adding a powerful fan, air purifier or both to the kitchen and running them when the stove is on will lower the chances of air quality becoming dangerously poor.\nHow to protect yourself from natural gas\n1. Keep your kitchen ventilated and always run the exhaust fan\nKeeping your kitchen well-ventilated, especially while cooking with gas, is one of the best defenses against gas leaks, airborne chemicals and toxins. Most kitchens have windows; if weather permits, always keep one open or cracked while cooking.\nDuring these colder months when cracking a window isn't always a viable option, you should consider adding a powerful fan to the kitchen that will help disperse concentrated air that may be harmful.\nYou should also run the exhaust fan above your range whenever the oven burner or stove is on and keep it running for 20 minutes or so even after you're finished since nasty stuff such as benzene and carbon monoxide may still be lingering in the air.\n2. Monitor your kitchen's air quality\nArguably, even more important than kitchen ventilation is keeping tabs on your air quality, and several devices are designed to do just that. Adding a carbon monoxide detector is a good start, but most are limited in the toxins they detect. More advanced air quality monitors such as Airthings View Plus and Nest Protect will register other volatile organic compounds (the bad stuff) and sync with an app to alert you directly via your mobile device when air quality becomes dangerous.\nAs a bonus, monitors like Airthings detect radon, an airborne carcinogen that occurs naturally as well as other harmful VOCs emitted from plastic wrapping materials, packaging and elsewhere.\n3. Don't let the burner run without ignition\nThis one may seem obvious, but letting the gas run before lighting more than a second or two can emit harmful toxins into your kitchen. If your stove burners aren't igniting right away, you may want to have the stove inspected, repaired or replaced. Double check that all burners are switched off when you've finished cooking.\n4. Adding an air purifier can help, but it's not a fix-all\nHEPA air purifiers help to clean dirty air, and adding one can lower the risk of airborne toxins in the kitchen. There are several toxins in natural gas, including benzene and carbon monoxide, that air purifiers won't remove. Plopping one by the stove is by no means a panacea for poor kitchen air quality. HEPA air purifiers may reduce these harmful volatile organic compounds but they won't eliminate them. These products should be used in concert with other defenses and safeguards.\n5. Have your gas stove checked for leaks\nLast year's Harvard study shows that gas stoves leak far more when not in use than previously thought. Because this gas is unburned, it's particularly toxic if inhaled. If you're worried about how much gas is leaking from your stove, you can have it tested by a service person from your gas company or hire a professional.\nThis is particularly important if you ever smell gas in the kitchen. If you do, you can bet there is probably a gas leak, and you should vacate the home until the problem is identified. If you want to test for gas leaks yourself, you can buy a detector for about $24 on Amazon.\n6. Switch to propane gas or an electric stove\nThis is the most surefire fix but also the most inconvenient and expensive solution. Switching to an electric stove or non-toxic propane fuel will mitigate the risks associated with natural gas. Even cooking with an electric stove can negatively affect air quality since burnt food and oils can release toxins into the air. It's a much lower risk than natural gas but is still reason enough to keep your kitchen ventilated and regularly test for air quality.\nCheck out more CNET Home Tips including how to slash your monthly internet bill and the three places to never put a home security camera."

      "text": "I've got a ton of reasons to love my air fryer. It's fast, super convenient and cranks out crispy, delicious food without much effort. Plus, unlike gas ovens, it doesn't mess with your indoor air quality. The best part? You don't have to drop more than $100 or $150 to get a great one.\nLately, I've found yet another reason to be obsessed with the smaller, faster, countertop convection oven: it helps me save on energy.\nCurious about how much you can actually save using an air fryer instead of a regular wall oven? I crunched some numbers. Turns out, air fryers use about half the energy as a traditional oven. That's not even counting the fact that they cook food faster and don't need much (if any) preheating.\nHere's a look at how I came up with those numbers and what kind of savings you might see by swapping your oven for the air fryer.\nCost of oven versus air fryer\n| Gas oven | Electric oven | Air fryer | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Cost per hour of cooking | 40 cents | 52 cents | 25 cents |\nHow much energy does an air fryer use?\nThe exact savings will be different for everyone since energy prices vary depending on where you live in the U.S. Plus, ovens aren't all the same\u2014newer ones are usually more efficient and use less gas or electricity. For this little breakdown, we're going to use some averages and rough estimates to get an idea of how much you could save by choosing the air fryer over the oven. And honestly, cutting energy costs is just one of many reasons we think air fryers are totally worth it.\nSo how did we get these numbers? The easiest way to figure out how much an air fryer might save you versus a big oven was to calculate the wattage pulled per hour versus how much an electric stove would use. The same goes for a gas oven, although for that you need to figure out the amount of natural gas used for a stove as well as the cost of natural gas in your state.\nDon't worry. We did the hard part.\nHow much energy do wall ovens use?\nDepending on what type of oven you have, gas or electric, operating costs will vary since natural gas prices and electricity costs vary rather dramatically by state and service provider. Both use a similar amount of energy and have somewhat similar upfront costs, if you own an older oven there's a good chance it's less energy-efficient than a newer model.\nHow much energy does a gas oven use?\nTo calculate the operating cost of your gas stove and oven, we take the energy rating of the oven in Btu and divide it by 100,000. Multiply the result by the cost per therm of natural gas in your state, which varies greatly, then multiply by the number of hours the oven is used. You should be able to find the energy rating of your oven online if you know the model name or number. It is likely somewhere on the unit itself. If you still have the owner's manual, you can find the energy rating there, measured in Btu.\nTo calculate the operating cost of an 18,000-Btu oven, you'll divide 18,000 by 100,000, giving you 0.18. We'll also need to find the average price per therm of natural gas in your state. This chart has the most recent prices via the US Energy Information Administration. Note that this chart is listed in dollars per thousand cubic feet, so you'll need to divide by 10. For instance, if the chart price is $23, you'll use $2.30 to calculate the cost.\nIn New York where I live, the price is currently $2.20 per therm (about average for the US). Next, we'll multiply that price for a therm by the number you calculated in the last step (0.18 in this example) to get the operating cost per hour of using your gas oven.\nFor me, it would cost about 40 cents per hour to run an 18,000-Btu oven. If I were to run an oven for 1 hour per day, it would cost $146 per year. In some states (including Georgia, Florida and Ohio), natural gas is about 30% higher than the national average. In Hawaii, it's more than double.\nHow much energy does an electric oven use?\nTo determine electric stove consumption you'll calculate the wattage pulled per hour of cooking. Most electric ovens draw around 3,000 watts, depending on the temperature. Once you find the wattage of your oven via the appliance tag, owner's manual or an online product listing, multiply that by the number of hours you use the oven each day (we'll use 1 hour for this calculation), then divide by 1,000 watts to find the kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity used.\nNext, find the average price per kWh of electricity in your state. For that, you can consult this chart that has the 2023 prices listed in cents per kWh. The prices for 2021 won't be released until December 2022, but if you do some web searching, you should be able to find the latest figures. Multiply that amount by the number you just calculated (3 kWh in this example) to determine your operating cost per day.\nWorking with New York's current electricity rate of 18 cents per kWh, a 3,000-watt oven would cost about 54 cents per hour when run at high heat. If I used my oven for roughly 1 hour per day for one year that would equal roughly $197 per year. This cost doesn't include energy used by the range and burners.\nHow much energy does an air fryer use?\nAir fryers are electric appliances, so we can use the same methodology as above to find the operating cost. The wattage for air fryers varies and larger models will use more energy, but a standard 4-quart fryer such as this Ninja (our top-rated model) uses about 1,500 watts.\nConsidering that's exactly half the wattage pull of the average full-size oven from our stove calculation, we can project that the air fryer will use roughly half as much electricity to operate.\nUsing New York's electricity prices, we safely say a standard 4-quart air fryer will cost about 27 cents per hour to run. That's 50% more energy-efficient than the average full-size electric oven and about 35% more efficient than the average gas oven (calculated with New York state's average energy costs).\nHow much money can you save using an air fryer?\n- Cost of 300 hours of cooking with a gas oven on high heat: $153\n- Cost of 300 hours of cooking with an electric oven on high heat: $162\n- Cost of 150 hours of cooking with an air fryer: $40\nThese numbers are a rough estimate, of course. The numbers will vary based on your state's energy cost, how much cooking you do in a year, what temperature you're cooking at and the type and size of oven you're using.\nThat's only half of the equation. Air fryers are even more energy- and cost-efficient than these raw numbers illustrate.\nHere's why\u2026\nAir fryers cook faster than big ovens\nBecause of the smaller cooking chamber and superconvection (intense fan blowing heat into food), air fryers generally cook foods much faster than your traditional gas or electric stove, often in about half the time it takes to make a similar recipe in a full oven.\nBelow are some examples of cooking times for air fryers versus stoves. The cooking website Taste of Home compiled a list of average air fryer cooking times for popular foods. We compared those with standard cooking times pulled from Food Network recipes for oven-baked or oven-roasted versions of those foods.\nCooking times: Air fryer versus oven\n| Food | Temperature | Air fryer cooking time (mins) | Oven cooking time with preheat (mins) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Chicken thighs | 400 F | 20-25 | 40 |\n| Chicken wings | 375 F | 10-12 | 40 |\n| Chicken breast | 375 F | 23 | 30 |\n| Salmon | 400 F | 5-7 | 12-15 |\n| Brussels sprouts | 350 F | 15-18 | 40 |\n| Bacon | 400 F | 5-10 | 20 |\n| Cauliflower | 400 F | 10-12 | 20 |\n| French fries (from scratch) | 400 F | 10-20 | 40-45 |\n| French fries (frozen) | 400 F | 6-8 | 18-20 |\nAir fryers don't need to preheat either\nDon't forget most air fryers also don't require any preheating time, making them even more efficient. The average full-size oven takes at least 10 minutes to preheat but usually more like 12 to 15 minutes. Preheating requires as much (or more) energy as actual cooking. In the chart above, I added a modest 10 minutes to each of the oven cooking times to account for preheating.\nIf you consider that an air fryer does the work of an oven in half the time (even faster when you include preheat time), 300 hours of cooking in a standard oven in a year would likely take fewer than 150 hours when done in an air fryer.\nBefore we get carried away\u2026\nAn air fryer is not a pound-for-pound replacement for an oven. There are plenty of foods that you probably won't want to cook in an air fryer. Others just plain won't fit in a standard air fryer. Certain models are spacious enough to cook a whole chicken, but for larger roasts, a Thanksgiving turkey or that Sunday lasagna -- not to mention most baking projects -- your air fryer may not be the best option.\nFor someone who doesn't bake much or cook whole turkeys and racks of lamb on the regular, an air fryer can shoulder a whole lot of the cooking that your more expensive, less energy-efficient oven has been handling.\nThe best reason to use an air fryer isn't the savings\nAn air fryer won't cook everything better than your oven, but there are some air fryer foods that a big oven can't touch. Because air fryers cook so fast and at high temps, foods like chicken wings, french fries and most frozen apps will get crispy on the outside without drying out inside the way they might when stuck in the large oven for 30 or 40 minutes.\nAs mentioned, air fryers don't require any preheating time either. Most of the models I've used are also extremely simple to operate, safe even for children to use and easy to clean.\nBonus: Air fryers are cheap\nYou can pay in the hundreds for an air fryer but many of the best ones we tested are less than that. You can pick up our favorite air fryer, the Ninja 4-quart, for $100, or cheaper if you find it on sale. Our favorite budget air fryer, the Gourmia 4-quart, can be found for just $60.\nIf you're curious, Instant Pots and multicookers also use significantly less energy than an oven. If you have an Instant Pot but no air fryer, you can snag the Mealthy air-frying lid for $85 or the Instant Pot's lid attachment for Instant Pot's lid for $50."

      "text": "The days are getting warmer, and if you're already thinking about ways to stay cool, now is the perfect time to get your window air conditioner summer-ready. Prepping it before the real heat kicks in can make a big difference. This yearly maintenance doesn't just improve the performance, but can also extend the lifespan of your AC, making it last up to 10 years. It can even keep your energy bills down. Follow these simple, budget-friendly tips to keep your AC in shape and ready for the warmer months.\nFor more, explore CNET's window AC unit buying guide and this comparison between window AC units and portable AC units.\n1. Choose the right AC model for your room\nWhen selecting a window AC unit, you need to account for the size of your room first. If you choose a less powerful model to cool a large area, it forces the unit to work harder to cool the room, resulting in a shorter operational life span.\nTherefore, when selecting the appropriate model, you want to examine an air conditioner's British thermal unit capacity (also known as BTUs). The more BTUs a unit has, the more powerful it is. As a guide, you need 20 BTUs for every square foot of the room you need to cool. In the case of a 500-square-foot room, you would need an air conditioner capable of delivering at least 10,000 BTUs.\nConversely, you could save money purchasing a less powerful model if you have a smaller room. Just keep in mind that the AC you're buying is an investment, and if you upgrade the size of your living space, you're probably going to need a more powerful model.\n2. Find the best location for your AC unit\nWhen setting up your AC unit, avoid placing it in direct sunlight if possible. Operating in direct sunlight will force it to work harder. Instead, if you have a window in your room that has shade, install it there. In turn, you'll extend the life of your air conditioner, since it won't overheat from the sunlight.\n3. Keep the filter clean\nThe filter collects particles like dust, hair and more. When you use your air conditioner regularly, you will need to wash the filter once a month.\nTo clean the filter, turn off the unit and unplug it. Next, remove the filter from the front panel. If you notice a lot of dust, hair or other debris, you can use the attachment from a vacuum cleaner to give the filter a deeper clean.\nYou can also clean the filter using soap and warm water. Once the filter dries, reinstall it. A good rule of thumb is to replace your filter once every six weeks to six months, depending on how often you use your air conditioner, how many pets you have and what kind of filter you use.\nIt might seem like a hassle to replace the filter so often, but it's in your best interests to do so. Outfitting your AC with a clean filter saves you a significant amount of money in the long run.\n4. Maximize efficiency\nHaving the air on full blast all the time shortens your AC's lifespan. While it does keep you cool, it also forces the unit to work harder to achieve this setting. Turning the air conditioner off when you leave maximizes its efficiency and prolongs its operational life span.\nA smart alternative is to use the eco-settings (if your system comes with one) or use a smart plug to manage your AC unit more closely via remote access on your phone and automatic on/off scheduling.\n5. Keep the fins clean and aligned\nYour window air conditioner has aluminum fins that cover the coils. Over time, dust, dirt and other debris can build on them. Without regular cleaning, it could lead to mold growth in the unit.\nWith this in mind, you should clean the fins at least once a year. To do so, turn off your air conditioner and unplug it. Next, you need to remove the housing screws. You can clean the fins with a mix of warm water and dish soap. Remove any particles you find with a brush. You should also rinse the remaining suds off the fins.\nAt this time, you want to make sure the fins are in good shape. The ones on the back coil can be prone to bending. And if they are bent, they force your AC unit to work harder. To straighten them, use a fin comb.\nRead more: How to Clean Your Window Air Conditioner\n6. Inspect and clean the drain\nWhen using your air conditioner, you should also inspect its drain once a month for any clogs. To remove them, use a stiff wire. Keeping your drain clear reduces the likelihood of moisture buildup, which can shorten the life of your AC.\nThese tips can help you prolong the life of your window unit. Make sure to do this maintenance (aside from replacing your filters more regularly) at least once a year. Ideally, try out these maintenance tips before the weather heats up so you aren't stuck making last minute repairs without air conditioning. You could also enlist the help of a professional to check your air conditioner for you.\nSave money around the home all year\n- Does Unplugging Appliances Really Save Electricity And Money?\n- Save Money on Gas, Electric and Water Bills With These Easy Tips\n- How Much Money Can You Actually Save by Turning Off Lights Around Your House?\n- The Best Energy Saving Smart Home Devices to Keep Your Utility Bills Down\n- Your Smart Thermostat Can Save You Money.

      "text": "Summer heat inspires lighter fare with shorter cooking times and less mess. Salmon ticks a lot of those boxes, but even grilling this healthy fish outside has its drawbacks. If you've ever had to scrape salmon skin off your grill, you know what I mean.\nThe air fryer may have made its name via its ability to make crispy wings and fries without all the oil, but it's also the perfect way to make filets of salmon or any other fish. The 10-minute method crisps the outside, leaving the inside a tender medium-rare. Best of all, there's no messy grill or oil-splattered stovetop to clean up afterward. And forget preheating the large oven, which takes twice as long and can raise the temperature of the kitchen by as much as 10 degrees (the air fryer won't).\nFor hot nights when I need something affordable, healthy and quick, this air fryer salmon is an easy decision. You can also play with the recipe, mixing and matching sauces, seasoning and sides until you find a flavor that fits your taste. Salmon tacos are a particular favorite in this house.\nHere's how to make a perfect filet every time. And for more, see our favorite places to order salmon online and the best air fryers we tested for 2025. If you're wondering how these trendy and efficient countertop cookers work and which model is best, read my complete guide to air fryers.\nIngredients for the 10-minute air fryer salmon\n- 1 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari\n- 1 tsp brown sugar\n- 1 green onion, diced\n- Salmon filet\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Parchment paper (optional)\nRead More: Best BBQ Sauces\nDirections for perfect 10-minute air fryer salmon\n- Step 1: Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F on either \"air fry\" or \"roast.\"\n- Step 2: Whisk together olive oil, brown sugar, soy sauce and green onion.\n- Step 3: Pat the salmon filet dry and place it in the air fryer on top of parchment paper (paper optional).\n- Step 4: Pour soy sauce mixture over salmon and brush to coat completely.\n- Step 5: Close the basket and cook for about 8 minutes, checking with a fork or internal probe for doneness (cook a minute or two more if you prefer your salmon medium well or well done).\nWhat else can I cook in the air fryer?\nThe air fryer is my go-to for roasted chicken, replacing my slow and dirty dish-heavy oven recipe. I recently learned to make juicy air fryer cheeseburgers and sizzle bacon in less than 10 minutes and without dirtying a skillet or sheet pan.\nWhy should I use an air fryer instead of an oven?\nAir fryers are incredibly convenient and can do many of the same jobs that an oven can. They only take a couple of minutes to preheat, contain many of the cooking messes you'd otherwise have to spend time cleaning up and are overall more energy-efficient cooking appliances.\nWhat's the biggest limitation of cooking with an air fryer?\nWhen you're planning to cook meals with an air fryer, you need to make sure you have enough space inside of your appliance for the food you want to cook. Many air fryers can accommodate for a single person's serving size, but you'll likely have to run the air fryer multiple times to make enough food for your whole family.\nCan I bake in an air fryer?\nYes, you can. The air fryer functions just like a convection oven, making it suitable for baking cookies, brownies and more."

      "text": "When the heat index climbs, turning on the oven feels like a bad idea. A countertop air fryer solves the problem. It cooks quickly, keeps the kitchen noticeably cooler, and still delivers that crisp, golden finish you want for weeknight dinners.\nI swapped a few sheet-pan meals for air fryer recipes during a warm stretch and the difference was immediate. No waiting for preheating, shorter cook times, and less lingering heat in the room. Cleanup took minutes, since the basket and tray went straight into the sink.\nIf your goal is fast summer dinners without heating the house, start here. These air fryer dishes keep things light on effort and heavy on flavor, with reliable results that make no-oven cooking an easy habit.\nWhat began as a glorified frozen-snack machine has turned into a full-on kitchen workhorse. The air fryer now handles everything from crispy chicken tenders to roasted veggies to gooey desserts. Beyond the staples, I've discovered a few surprising air fryer foods that I'm now completely hooked on.\nFrom whole-roasted chicken and flaky salmon to vegetables and sides, such as cauliflower, potatoes and carrots, certain foods feel like they were made to cook in an air fryer. You'll find a ton of Reddit threads with home cooks asking for the ultimate air fryer recipes and we've put together this guide to help you out with our favorites.\nLooking for something great to make? Check out the nine foods you absolutely have to cook in an air fryer below.\nAnd if you're searching for an air fryer or to upgrade your existing oven, we have a new favorite model with a glass cooking chamber that's easy to clean and doubles as a food storage container.\n1. Salmon\nBroiled salmon is a simple, healthy weeknight dinner staple. It's not difficult to make in the oven but if you're only cooking for one or two people, the preheating time is a pain and you'll waste a lot of energy for a small amount of food. Pan-seared salmon is great and quick, but there's almost no way to cook salmon on the stove without creating an oily and odorous mess.\nI tried cooking roasted salmon in the air fryer and it came out perfectly in about 10 minutes, including preheating time. The closed cooking chamber captures all of the grease and even hides some of the fishy smell from taking over the space.\nOK, so you might catch me throwing the occasional filet of salmon on the grill during warmer months, but gone are the days of me wiping fish grease from the backsplash behind my kitchen stove.\nHere's how to make perfect air fryer salmon.\n2. Whole chicken\nThis one surprised me the most because I make a roast chicken most Sundays and had become content with my method of using the oven. I learned fast that the air fryer does an even better job because it's able to crisp the skin quickly without overcooking the meat. Air-fryer roasted chicken takes about 45 minutes -- about 15% quicker than the oven -- and it's nearly impossible to screw up.\nHere's how to make a quick roasted chicken in the air fryer.\n3. Bacon cheeseburgers\nAir fryer cheeseburgers have become a staple around my home. The exception is during summer when the grill is in full swing but during cooler months, I turn to the air fryer for this American classic. It's not only cleaner than pan frying but the burger doesn't cook in its own grease so you get a lighter, healthier meal (if you're into that sort of thing). You can also stick the bun and a couple of slices of bacon in with the burger and you have the full meal with almost no cleanup to manage.\nHere's how to make a cheeseburger from top to bottom in the air fryer.\n4. Chicken cutlets\nBefore the air fryer, I used to pan-fry breaded chicken cutlets for chicken Parmesan and other recipes but the air fryer does the same job with less mess and produces less oily fried chicken, too.\nI recommend using boneless chicken thighs, which have enough fat content to withstand all that convection heat without drying out. Simply coat the chicken in beaten egg wash followed by bread crumbs mixed with salt, pepper and other spices. Cook at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes.\nYou can spray the cutlets lightly with a bit of oil before cooking to get an extra crispy crust but it's not necessary. I've tried the same method with chicken breasts; it works well but there is more risk of drying out the meat.\n5. Cauliflower steak\nOne of my favorite things to cook in the air fryer is cauliflower. A slab of cauliflower makes an excellent hearty side dish or main course if you're going plant-based. Simply toss a thick slice or two of cauliflower with olive oil and salt and pepper, or some seasoning of your choice, and air fry for 10 or 12 minutes on high. The air fryer gives it a beautiful caramelized crust and it cooks the dense veggie fast enough so that the inside of the cauliflower doesn't become mushy.\n6. Leftover pizza\nWhile not every type of food is best reheated in the air fryer, a lot of them are. Air fryers are the perfect way to revive leftover pizza, fried chicken, grilled meats and vegetables. A microwave heats food unevenly and tends to impart a rubbery texture. Air fryers give food a second life via convection heat for a crispy crust and even heating.\nHere's the best way to reheat every type of leftover.\n7. Hot dogs\nIt's hard to screw up a hot dog but if you want a perfectly charred wiener in less than five minutes with essentially no cleanup, look to the air fryer. Air fryer hot dogs are as simple as simple gets and the super convection oven gives them a perfect browning in two or three minutes.\nHere's how to make hot dogs in the air fryer all summer.\n8. Baked potatoes\nOK, so technically this one starts out in the microwave and then gets finished in the air fryer. The microwave softens the inside in less than 8 minutes while the air fryer blasts the edges and skin to a crispy perfection. It's a restaurant-quality baked potato in less than 12 minutes. Here's how to make the best air fryer baked potato ever.\nAnd if you're still not sure what an air fryer is and how it works, check out our complete guide to air fryers.\n9. Grilled cheese\nFor a grilled cheese, the air fryer is working on both of the bread surfaces and the cheese all at once, resulting in a quicker melt, which adheres the cheese to the bread slices together making for a much easier flip. (Flipping is still recommended but with far less drama.)\nHere's the secret to perfect air fryer grilled cheese."

      "text": "I'm lucky to call the high desert home -- a place where warm days practically demand we head out to explore the lakes, rivers and mountains in every direction, ideally before the crowds catch on. And when I'm gearing up for a hike, there's a handful of tech I always toss in my pack.\nIf you've got a hiking or camping trip on the calendar, check out the gadgets and essentials I swear by. They can turn a quick afternoon trek or a full weekend adventure into something smoother, safer and more fun. Here's what's worth making room for in your bag.\n1. A GPS tracker and communicator\nFor serious hikers, a GPS device is a must-have, especially when exploring less-trod trails and documenting your route afterward. It also functions as a safety net if something goes seriously wrong or you lose your stuff (climbers may even want a dedicated tracker for their additional supplies). I like the basic GPS trackers like this $30 LandAirSea model, but it's easy to upgrade to a GPS watch.\nNowadays, there's a new GPS darling on the scene that combines GPS with a satellite communicator or walkie-talkie, like this $400 Garmin model. That's pricey, but communication features can be invaluable, especially for more serious forays beyond the trails or for volunteer trail work. You could also upgrade to a GPS map version, like this more affordable $200 Garmin version.\n2. Collapsible trekking poles\nTrekking or hiking poles are generally associated with uphill trails and icy or slippery conditions, but I've found they're a lot more useful than expected. Collapsible poles from Black Diamond or Trekology can easily fit in or on your pack and only come out when needed. They're a lifesaver if you or a buddy gets unexpectedly winded, finds a rough patch trail or becomes injured and needs a bit of help getting back to the roadside. You'll frequently be glad you brought them along.\n3. Filtration straw or pump\nWhile LifeStraw has popularized the easily packaged filtration device, you can these filters in all shapes and sizes for your hike. Some even include pumps to easily filter water and add it to a bottle or bucket from a nearby river, lake, pond or pool. With something as lightweight and affordable as a LifeStraw, you can add it to nearly any pack. But filtration devices are especially important if you're going to be out for more than a day or two.\n4. Collapsible canteen\nWhile people love their Stanley Cups and Nalgenes (where I live we're Hydroflask people), those bottles are a little too large and heavy to comfortably take on every hike, especially if you're going to be carrying around a pack for a long time. And on longer hikes when space is at a premium, they grow even more annoying.\nMy favorite alternative is a collapsible canteen or soft water bottle, like this $30 model from Hydaway. They're lightweight water bottles designed to save space when they aren't full. As long as you rinse them out and keep them clean, you can keep them with your hiking pack so you always have a way to quickly stock up on water and take a drink without weighing you down.\nRead more: Best Dog Toys, According to the Experts: Our Dogs\n5. Daypack with battery pack\nEven casual hikers should invest in a simple daypack to carry along all these gadgets I'm talking about. A daypack is the smallest and most affordable version of a hiking backpack, popularized by brands like bike-friendly Camelbak (drinking straw included). They've got just enough room to store the essentials and a couple of snacks, plus a design that helps reduce sweat when walking in the heat.\nThere are many options to upsize to larger packs for longer hikes, but you should take a look at this Gregory pack for a more affordable upgrade. Whatever you choose, I highly recommend adding a small battery pack so you have a way to charge your phone and devices when they run low. Some of my friends love portable solar panels for charging, but they aren't quite as convenient as slipping a battery pack into a spare pouch.\n6. Rechargeable headlamp\nIf you're planning on camping for the evening, watching the sunset out on the trail or plotting a moonlight hike, you'll want a reliable headlamp to light up the dark while keeping your hands free. Today's headlamp bands are easy to pull on and quickly rechargeable, making them perfect for these types of shorter excursions. Black Diamond has some of my favorite options for around $50, but you can find many different options including more affordable picks.\n7. An all-purpose pad or sweat cloth\nPee cloths are traditionally for those who need to find a quiet place to crouch, go and then clean up while out on the trails, but these cleaning pads are worth it no matter your bathroom plans. With decorative art, reflective strips, anti-microbial surfaces and reliable hand protection, they can serve as coffee cozies, de facto \"gloves\" to handle messes or potholders for hot soups, along with anything else you need. The pads can become surprisingly all-purpose, even if they never get called for bathroom duty -- just, uhh, remember to clean them before use.\nIf you're very sure you won't need a pad like this, take a look at this PackTowl microfiber towel ($33)designed specifically for hikes and perfect for toweling off the sweat and mosquito spray when you need to. That way you won't have to worry about staining your favorite bandana.\n8. A trusty hiking app\nFinally, adding a hiking app to your phone can be tremendously helpful (although a waterproof map is always a good idea, too). Hiking apps, both national and local, excel at providing helpful information and up-to-date trail conditions as well as easily-zoomable maps for navigation. They're a big upgrade for any hiking endeavor and most can work offline if you want to download a map.\nIf there's no standout hiking apps for your specific state, region or mountain range, then popular generic apps include AllTrails and Gaia GPS, both with free download options. I personally like Gaia GPS more if you're willing to sign up for a plan, but the many filters of AllTrails are available at no cost, which is always a great deal.\nIf you want to spend a bit more, the latest Apple Watch and WatchOS 11 updates include some excellent and inuitive GPS improvements for hiking and finding waypoints -- without taking yourself too much out of the experience. And if batteries fail, I always like to have a physical map packed somewhere with a compass just in case.\nNow that you've started your journey, why not continue with our recommendations for the best outdoor tech, the top outdoor security cameras, how to add important security when living the van life, and our Editors' Choice picks for the top AI and future tech."

      "text": "The best blender for 2025\nCountertop blenders are a kitchen staple. They're versatile and efficient appliances that can help you make smoothies and soups and even grind coffee beans. If you want to make pancakes, you can even smoothen the batter in these powerful devices. The bottom line? A good blender is incredibly useful, and you owe it to yourself to invest in one if you haven\u2019t already.\nTo ensure you have the best blenders to choose from, our CNET team tested 15+ models, tracking their unique features and listing their pros and cons. The Vitamix Explorian came out on top overall, but as a premium brand, it'll cost a lot more than a dime. For a more budget-friendly option, we recommend the Nutribullet.\nAfter thoroughly testing various blenders, our CNET experts have selected the best blenders of 2025 for you.\nBest blenders of 2025\nThere's a reason Vitamix blenders enjoy a fervent following. These category darlings aren't just powerful, but a pleasure to operate and built to last years. The high cost is the downside with many models selling for $400 or more, but the entry-level Explorian will give you great value for money and lands on our list as the best overall blender for 2025.\nThe Explorian passed every blender test we ran with flying colors and sports one of the best interfaces -- simple, intuitive and not prone to breaking. The Explorian's base and canister are sturdy, don't wobble and, as I can report from years of personal experience, the Explorian lasts years and holds its power. And if it doesn't, Vitamix blenders come with a free five-year warranty and the brand offers excellent repair programs to support your purchase.\nThe Explorian offers basic blending functions and no fancy presets, but we don't care much for those anyhow. Its 1,500 watts is plenty of power to crush nuts into nut butter and there's no frozen fruit this machine can't pulverize in seconds. The 48-ounce canister is also set low, so it stores more easily than other models in the Vitamix line.\nThe Vitamix is worth its normal $380 price tag, but it often goes on sale, which is exactly when you should pounce.\nNutriBullet keeps it simple with three power levels, a pulse setting and 1,200 watts of power. It performed well in all of our tests. Smooth batters, finely crushed ice, green smoothies, hot soup and good grated cheese (our torture test) were all easy to achieve. A reasonable price tag means you won't have to break the bank to get a good blender.\nSlightly more powerful than the comparable Ninja model below, NutriBullet gets the job done quickly. The 64-ounce blending jar is plenty big enough for most recipes. The personal blender comes with a handy recipe book and a tamper to make sure all your ingredients contact the blades. The NutriBullet blender jar is also dishwasher safe and comes with a one-year warranty.\nSimple, powerful and consistent, the NutriBullet is one of the best moderately priced blenders on the market right now and you can have it for about $80 at Amazon right now.\nPros\n- This built-in twisting tamper prevents you from having to stop and loosen ingredients manually\n- Whopping 1,600 watts of power, yet small enough to store in a cupboard\n- Includes two single-serve blending cups\nCons\n- Higher potential for breakage due to the extra plastic parts\n- Base rocks a bit when blending at full speed\nI was very close to giving this the top spot on our list, but because of the smaller size, it might not be the best fit for everyone. But if smoothies are the No. 1 reason you pull out the blender, Ninja's Twisti is the best blender for your buck. This smartly designed, compact model has tamper blades built into the lid that you can twist manually to loosen stuck and stubborn ingredients without having to stop the motor.\nIn addition to cranking out clump-free smoothies in seconds and without having to stop and scrape, this blender nailed the other tests, including turning nuts into powder and crushing ice in seconds. With 1,100 watts of operating power, there isn't much this blender can't pulverize in a snap.\nThe main reason this unit isn't atop our list is that it's small -- just 34 ounces -- so it won't be the best pick if you use your blender for making large batches of soups or sauces. But for dip makers and smoothie drinkers who want to save themselves the extra step of having to stop midblend to set dense ingredients free, this blender is your best bet.\nWhen you reach a certain level (and price), most blenders do just about everything you need and so you have to start splitting hairs. Vitamix, Blendtec, Hurom, Braun and Cleanblend all make powerful blenders you likely won't regret buying -- but what we love about Breville's stately Super Q, beyond its performance, are the thoughtful touches. The build and materials used for this blender are sturdy and elegant, and the canister is a different, slightly silkier grade of plastic.\nThe Q also comes with loads of extras but nothing superfluous. In addition to the 68-ounce canister and a staggering 1,800-watt motor base, you get a 24-ounce blending cup with its own separate blade attachment for making single-serve smoothies or soups to take on the go. There are also dozens of presets which take time to learn but, once you do, make blending a very enjoyable experience.\nAs for the tests we ran, the Super Q did as well or better than any of the others. It shredded cheese with ease, pulverized raw almonds to smithereens and made quick and consistent work of ice and a pancake batter mix. The Breville has a few blender settings and programs. Yet since it's not trying to reinvent the wheel, there aren't so many that it'll overwhelm you.\nThis is the most expensive blender we tested, but it was also the most pleasurable to use. If you've got half a grand to spend on a blender, you won't regret the Super Q. And if past experience with Breville kitchen appliances is any indicator, it will last you a while.\nOther models we tested\nHurom Hexa Power Speed: If you're looking for simple functionality and pure power, this is our top pick. The Hurom Hexa doesn't have many fancy presets and functions (just smoothie, ice crush, soup and pulse) but does have 1,600 watts of power to whip the crap out of anything that you put inside. It almost feels industrial grade and creates a vortex inside akin to something you'd see at a science museum. We also love how this blender looks with its shiny stainless steel armor. Worth noting that it's the tallest of the blenders we tested so it won't store as easily as some of the others.\nBeautiful by Drew Barrymore: (Update: Out of Stock) We've been impressed by other products from this new line of budget-friendly kitchen appliances, including the electric kettle and air fryer. Sadly, the blender did not pass muster. It's serviceable, to be certain, but didn't excel in testing and it feels a bit cheap. I'd also worry about the shelf life of its all-digital control panel.\nCuisinart SmartPower SPB-7CH: It's hard to figure out what happened to this stalwart kitchen brand but this blender model, along with other Cuisinart appliances I've tested lately, have been disappointing. That's especially true when you consider the bloated prices. The digital blender feels cheap and flimsy and netted mediocre results in testing.\nVitamix 5200: Variable speed and sturdy design make this Vitamix 5200 blender a popular model for luxury blenders. Though considered a high-performance blender, at such a high price, we weren't wowed enough to recommend it. It oddly struggled with cheese grating and we found it to be noticeably louder than other models.\nBlendtec Total Classic: This popular Blendtec blender worked well with frozen ingredients and crushed ice, making it a good choice for blending smoothies and making frozen cocktails. However, the Blendtec failed to grate cheese and the batter mixing preset was less effective than regular blending by speed.\nHamilton Beach Power Elite: Affordability aside, this blender didn't perform well enough to recommend. While it did have a nice glass bowl, the lid was infuriatingly hard to remove. It has only presets, so you'll need to deduce which ones are actually low, medium or high.\nBlack & Decker Crush Master: This blender will work if you really need something cheap in a pinch. But don't expect excellence. It wasn't able to handle large frozen strawberries or evenly mix pancake batter. Still, it could suffice for small jobs.\nBreville Fresh & Furious: Great looks and bonus points for a cool name, but that's not enough to recommend this blender. Performance was average and it struggled to mix wet and dry ingredients.\nBeast Health: The $165 Beast Health may be the best-looking blender ever, and it works well, until it doesn't. The Beast Health's motor gave out after about 14 months -- too quickly for a blender this expensive -- causing us to remove it from a top spot on this list.\nNinja BL610: This is another great blender around the $100 range. Ultimately, NutriBullet's edged the Ninja in a few of the tests but the NInja had a slightly sturdier build. This is a fine blender and well worth the money.\nKitchenAid K400: This KitchenAid blender is beautiful, but left something to be desired when it came to performance for that price. It has five speeds, pulse and three presets. If you have your heart set on a colorful blender with retro flare, the KitchenAid is a good option.\nOster Versa Pro Series (Update: Out of stock): This Oster model is a good performer and includes a few extra features we found helpful. It's on the expensive side, but this price includes a beverage container and a set of bowls and blades for food processing. You're almost getting two appliances here, a blender and a food processor. It also has a reverse blend button which is great for crushing ice and making nut flour.\nHow we test blenders\nTesting blenders isn't just making smoothies and crushing ice. There are a lot of other recipes blenders work well for and these tests highlight how capable each model is when it comes to dry, large and coarse ingredients.\nIce\nIn a test of pure crushing power, we placed two cups of ice cubes into each blender. Counting the number of pulses it takes to get to fine, crushed ice gives a good indication of real-world chopping power. The three blenders we recommended above performed well.\nSmoothie\nA classic blender recipe, fruit smoothies were high on my list of recipes to test. This shouldn't be a big stress test for any decent blender and so it really comes down to speed and consistency. We used two cups of orange juice and one cup of frozen strawberries to make the test smoothies.\nWhile many of these tests yielded very similar results, a few worked faster than others. Not all blenders come with presets, but the ones that do almost always include a smoothie function. When possible, this is the mode we used. If there was no smoothie blender function, we followed the blender's manual recommendation for smoothie making. This was usually around a minute on high.\nThis is a relatively easy test and most blenders handled frozen ingredients well. Some were frothier and some slushier, but only the Black & Decker model left large chunks of frozen strawberry unblended.\nNut flour and butter\nBlenders aren't all about beverages. There are plenty of other uses, including grinding dry ingredients. For our dry ingredient test, we put a cup of almond pieces (unroasted) in each blender and pulsed until those pieces were reduced to a fine flour. A bit of a challenge for some blenders, but most were able to do this in about 10 to 20 pulses, with the Hamilton Beach model yielding noticeably coarser results.\nNut butter is a different story. Most blenders aren't really designed for long running times and the level of processing needed to make a butter like almond butter or peanut butter. In fact, many recommend not running the blender for more than a few minutes at a time.\nOnly one Vitamix model showed real signs of progress toward almond butter in our testing with the nut flour, and it plateaued before achieving a good consistency. Most models simply whirred the dry ingredients upward and into the hard-to-wash crevices of their lids. If you're set on making nut butter, we recommend a model like the Oster with an included processing kit, or a separate food processor.\nCheese\nDid you know blenders can shred cheese? It's true; some blenders can. We placed an 8-ounce block of cheese in each blender and pulsed until the entire block was shredded. This brought to light a few interesting design choices among some models. The Ninja, for example, lost the cheese round because multiple blender blade levels made it impossible to fit the cheese block in the blender. I had to cut it up into pieces.\nBoth Vitamix models had some trouble with this particular test and bore holes in the cheese block without actually blending it, simultaneously melting what little cheese had been shredded as the machine heated up. Meanwhile, the NutriBullet, Ninja, instant Pot, Breville Super Q and Hurom Hexa handled grating the cheese block in less than five pulses.\nPancake batter\nIf you've seen our list of the best waffle makers, it should come as no surprise that pancake batter made an appearance in our blender testing. While I was happy to fire up the griddle and flip some cakes, mixing batter is an important test. It measures how easy or difficult it is for the blender to mix wet and dry ingredients.\nBlender buying tips\nLike most kitchen appliances, you should think about how often you'll use it, for what tasks and is it a portable blender. Many budget blenders could handle a few smoothies every summer. It's not worth spending $200 on a blender you'll use for two occasions each year. If you're mixing batters, grinding dry ingredients and crushing ice on a regular basis, however, it might be wise to invest in a quality model. Here are a few things to keep in mind.\nAccessories\nWith a conventional blender, accessories can make all the difference. A blender that comes with a tamper is great for getting those last stubborn bits into the blender blades and it's one item I would highly recommend checking for when you buy a blender. Several models we tested included one in the box. You can purchase them separately, but they're often model-specific with a ring guard at the top to keep you from plunging the tamper into the blender blades.\nIf you'll be making smoothies and frozen drinks, a blender with a special set of travel blender cup containers makes getting out the door one step easier. If you're blending larger, more dense foods for recipes, consider a model that has either a food processing bowl and wheel blade option or something with high-power wattage. Ninja and NutriBullet make these kits for travel containers and processors.\nPreset preference\nNext, consider your preference for specific modes versus speeds. We found some modes to be effective and helpful, while other blenders worked better when we took over and chose a speed for my ingredients, watching for when to stop. Some models offer simply low, medium and high modes. Others, like many Vitamix models, are variable, with speeds 1 to 10 on a dial. While it comes down to preference, in my opinion, you'll have more control over your result without a preset. Yes, you'll need to keep watch and be a bit more hands-on, but it's easier to be sure things don't get too blended, overheated or stop before everything is truly mixed.\nDesign\nBlenders don't have to be boring. KitchenAid models come in a rainbow of colors. The Oster Versa Pro above looks pretty sporty and the Breville Super Q and Hurom Hexa both had lovely finishes and a sturdy feel. Don't forget to consider aesthetics if this appliance will live on your countertop.\nIf your blender will be on your kitchen counter, we recommend measuring the height between your countertop and your upper cabinets. A few models we tested including the Hurom and Breville Super Q may not fit beneath standard cabinets and would inhibit you from sliding it to the back of my counter when not in use.\nThere are several types of blenders and each is designed for a specific use.\nFull-sized blenders: This is the blender you probably imagine when someone says the word \"blender.\" These are the most versatile of the bunch, but they are also generally the largest, with blending jars as large as 72 ounces. If you do a lot of blending -- soups, dips, smoothies, sauces, frozen drinks and nut butter -- you'll want a good full-sized blender. They can be as powerful as 2,000 watts and cost as much as $600, but you can also nab a great one with fewer bells and whistles and less power for $100 or so (see above).\nPersonal blenders: This term refers to smaller blenders such as NutriBullet, Beast, NutriNinja and others. These blenders have less capacity, around 24 to 32 ounces, give or take. They're great for soups and smoothies but often have a bit less power -- between 900 and 1,000 watts -- so they're not as good for dense ingredients like nuts.\nImmersion blenders: These handheld versions of the blender have one main use: to puree a soup or sauce that's already in a pot. An immersion blender saves you from having to transfer hot liquids from a pot to a blender jar. Though some cost a pretty penny, many serviceable immersion blenders start as low as $30.\nPortable blenders: These blenders are so small that you can take them with you on the go. They often run on battery, so you can blend anywhere -- the beach, at your desk or after the gym. BlendJet is a popular brand and their teeny-weeny blenders cost around $60.\nWhile a blender and food processor are similar at first blush, they are used for distinctly different kitchen and cooking jobs. A food processor can't do the work of a blender, nor can a blender do the work of a food processor: They're not interchangeable.\nBlenders generally have one fixed blade designed to puree or whip ingredients into a liquid or smooth paste. Classic examples are smoothies, soups, sauces and nut butters. Food processors, on the other hand, generally have a set of blades for different tasks -- they're best when they step in for your knife. Most food processors can chop, dice and mince. They can also grate and shred if you need a lot of cheese or are making coleslaw from scratch.\nWhile they won't do each other's tasks well, you can buy blenders with food processor attachments, including this $200 Ninja MegaSystem (includes blender) or this $250 Vitamix food processor attachment (does not include blender) that works with Ascent and Venturist models.\nWattage and horsepower are the two most common ways to measure the sheer capacity of a blender. For small or personal blenders, 1,000 watts of power is all you'll need given the minimal amount of ingredients you're blending. For large and full-sized blenders, 1,100 watts is still more than a serviceable amount of power to do most of the daily blending jobs you'll ask of it. Our top blender picks for the price -- the Ninja and the NutriBullet -- are both in that 1,100 range. They both performed well and cost much less than a Vitamix or Breville.\nWattage in premium and super-premium blenders can go as high as 2,000, though most are somewhere between 1,400 and 1,800 watts. This amount of power means you'll likely get a longer life out of the blender since it won't have to rely on full power to do the easier, daily blending jobs. It also means faster blending since the blades are able to hit higher speeds.\nTotal horsepower is a sexy (and newer) unit of measurement for blenders, but brands also use it for smoke and mirrors. For more, read about the truth about horsepower in blenders."

      "text": "If you\u2019re aiming to eat healthier without giving up on flavor or convenience, an air fryer is the perfect companion. They use less oil to achieve the same crispy and caramelized texture you get from pan-frying, roasting, and broiling. To help you find the best, I've tested models from Ninja, De\u2019Longhi, Breville, Phillips, Cosori and Dash.\nOur Picks\nFrom cooking whole chickens to crisping up chickpeas, vegetables or salmon, air fryers handle it all with ease. I make no secret of my love for air fryers, and I've been testing various models for more than five years. My list of favorite things to make in the air fryer grows by the week, but choosing the right countertop oven to make them isn't as simple as it seems.\nWhat's the best air fryer overall?\nWhen Ninja released its Ninja glass-bowl Crispi, we got a new favorite air fryer on our list after two years. The Crispi has loads of power and is easy to clean, plus the cooking chamber doubles as a portable food container. This is hands down the best air fryer to buy in 2025. And guess what? It's available for just $180 -- a bargain.\nThe dynamic glass Crispi is the air fryer we now recommend most, but there are several other picks to choose from that cost less, hold more food or feature additional cooking modes and methods not available on that model.\nRead more: The Air Fryer Is the Best and Fastest Way to Make a Roast Chicken\nBest air fryers of 2025\nPros\n- Glass cooking chamber is easy to clean\n- Can view your food's progress without stopping\n- Cooking chamber turns into a sealed food container\n- Simple controls\nCons\n- Glass gets hot during and after cooking\n- Pricier than others on the list\n- No precise control of temperature\nWhat I liked:\nOur new favorite air fryer comes from the makers of our old favorite. The glass bowl Ninja offers several advantages over metal and nonstick cooking baskets. First, you can see your food while it's being cooked. After cooking, the glass bottom chamber converts to a sealable food carrier when you pop on a rubber lid. As a bonus, the Ninja Crispi's glass cooking chamber was the easiest to get squeaky clean of all the air fryers we've tested.\nUnlike most air fryers that utilize a basket that slides in and out of the machine, this air fryer has a cooking mechanism that clamps down on one of the included 4-quart or 6-cup containers. The powerful coils cooked everything we put inside to a perfect, even crisp. Four simple cooking modes -- warm, reheat, bake, and air fry -- and the adjustable timer made using the machine a breeze.\nWho is it for:\nIt's the best air fryer for those who are particular about getting their kitchen tools squeaky clean. It's also the best air fryer for anyone concerned about nonstick coatings and the potential hazards they present.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe one downside, aside from the high price, is that the glass chamber gets and stays pretty hot both during and after cooking, which could present a danger to careless cooks or those with small children. The glass bowls are equipped with stay-cool handles for handling and transporting the air fryer.\nPros\n- Modest size is good for crowded kitchens\n- Air fryer function was great\n- Able to do gentle toasting in addition to powerful air-frying\n- Fun retro look and available in a range of colors\n- Steam function helps keep food moist\nCons\n- There are definitely cheaper options available\n- Air fryer toaster ovens aren't as easy to clean\nWhat I liked:\nA conveniently sized, PFAS-free, countertop-worthy appliance that can air fry, bake, roast, toast, reheat and broil -- all with steam infusion technology for crispy exteriors and soft, moist interiors. It does everything, from ultra-crispy air frying to serious roasting, to rejuvenating steam infusion. It\u2019s fairly spacious, although certainly not the largest oven we tried. You could roast a roughly 4-pound chicken or go multilevel to cook double the capacity of a stand-alone air fryer.\nThis oven allows you to\nWho is it for:\nIf you have trouble keeping your air-fryer food from drying out, the Wonder Oven is the only model on our list with a steam function that helps keep food moist while it's being blasted with superconvection heat.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe modest capacity means you may have to cook food in batches. If you regularly feed a large crowd, consider upgrading to a larger air fryer or air-frying toaster oven.\nPros\n- Has major power and cooked food faster than any other air fryer we tested\n- The build is sturdy\n- Controls are simple\n- At $69, it's an excellent value\nCons\n- Its shiny plastic body shows fingerprints easily\nWhat I liked:\nNinja's sleek and efficient pod air fryer impressed us in several rounds of testing. At $69, it's a clear pick for the best budget air fryer in 2025. The Ninja is powerful, easy to operate, looks great and is reasonably priced. We tested both the 4-quart model and the otherwise identical 5.5-quart model (perfect for roasting a whole chicken). There were no discernible differences in performance between the two.\nThe Ninja turned out the best chicken wings of any air fryer we cooked them in. It seems to run a little hotter than other models of its size, but I consider that a good thing. Air frying is about getting the outside crispy without drying out the middle, and you need a blast of hot convection to do it.\nWho is it for:\nThose seeking a budget-friendly basket-style air fryer with lots of power. The Ninja's control panel is simple and intuitive. Beyond flicking on the air fryer, there are a handful of presets and cooking modes, including bake and reheat, that are perfect for warming bread or reviving leftover pizza without burning it.\nWho should avoid it:\nThis air fryer sports a nonstick basket, so if you're worried about chemical leaching or the coating wearing out over time, choose Ninja's glass-bowl air fryer instead. One other thing to note is that the Ninja lacks a special cooking mode for vegetables. Much as in earlier rounds of testing, the fresh Brussels sprouts emerged a tad overdone -- even burnt in spots. This simply requires a little more checking when you're air-frying certain foods for the first time.\nPros\n- Air fryer and pressure cooker both work great\n- Great value considering how much it does\nCons\n- Difficult to clean after air frying\n- Heavier than solo air fryers\nWhat I like:\nThis Instant Pot model is a pressure cooker, slow cooker, and air fryer with sear and steam functions, to boot. I found the air fryer function worked as well or better than most of the solo air fryers I tested.\nInstant Pot's Duo model made incredible crispy \"fried\" chicken, wings, veggies, and other classics, but know that you'll likely have to cook in batches if you're making food for a group. It's also a solid deal considering all this machine does. The Duo Crisp can often be found for $150 or cheaper if you nab it on sale.\nWho is it for:\nIf you're eyeing an air fryer but also an Instant Pot or another multicooker, let me save you some money and kitchen space. The Instant Pot Duo does all the work of the popular multicooker -- pressure cooker, slow cooker, steam and saute -- but comes with a separate air fryer lid and cooking function as well.\nWho should avoid it:\nIt's worth noting that the air fryer cooking capacity is relatively small, even if the full chamber for pressure and slow cooking is large. Another thing I didn't love about this model is the steel air fryer basket, which is trickier to clean than the pod-shaped models, most of which feature nonstick cooking baskets.\nPros\n- Sleek design and consistent function\n- Close to a replacement for your wall oven\n- Preheats fast\n- Great for holidays or when extra cooking capacity is needed\nCons\n- Expensive\n- A large cooking chamber makes it harder to get that true air fryer crust.\n- The air fryer function isn't as powerful as some others we tried\nWhat I like:\nBreville's stylish Smart Oven Air is our favorite air fryer and toaster combo. This isn't just a proficient air fryer but a mini version of a smart oven that can handle a small chicken, as many as four filets of salmon or a tray of homemade cookies. Most likely because of its size, the Smart Oven Air took a little bit longer to get crispy chicken wings and Brussels sprouts, but only by a few minutes.\nWho is it for:\nIf you want a countertop appliance that can do far more than wings and wedges, this is a whole lot of oven capability. The Breville heats very consistently and has a wealth of cooking modes -- toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, warm, reheat, air fry -- making it about as good a replacement for your big oven as any. This makes a great supplement to your large oven during holidays and other occasions where extra cooking capacity is welcomed.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf you like a toaster oven and are just looking for an air fryer, this probably isn't the pick.\nPros\n- Light and easy to move around the kitchen\n- Good power despite a compact 2-quart size\n- Comes in 5 colors\n- Has a fun retro look\nCons\n- Small 2-quart capacity is not ideal for large groups or families\nWhat I like:\nAs the award suggests, this air fryer is small. About as small as any brand makes them. If you're only cooking for one or two people, it may be enough capacity and will save you precious space on the counter. The Dash has enough power to make eight or nine crispy chicken wings in about 20 minutes and a few servings of fries in about half that time.\nThe single analog dial is easy to manipulate, and there is just one mode -- air fry -- to keep things uncomplicated. For an air fryer under $50, this model is fairly solid, and the basket fits snugly into the hull without any wobble. It's also easy to clean and quiet when running.\nWho is it for:\nIf you're after pure value, the Dash performs well and will cost less than $50. It's also perfect for smaller kitchens or those wanting to test out an air fryer without committing much money or kitchen space.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf you're cooking for more than two or three people, this air fryer won't be big enough.\nPros\n- Dual basket design allows you to cook multiple foods at once\n- Huge capacity for making big batches of food for crowds\nCons\n- Takes up a lot of space in the kitchen\n- Expensive for an air fryer\nWhat I like:\nA dual-basket air fryer allows you to cook most of an entire meal in one go without fear of burning one thing or undercooking the other. Smaller baskets net better results when air frying, so I suggest a dual-basket as opposed to an oven with one single, large cooking chamber. This model has all the same settings and cooking modes as Ninja's single-basket model, but allows you to toggle between both baskets to set the time and temp accordingly. There's also a handy match-cook setting if you're doing one huge heap of wings in both baskets.\nWhile Instant also makes a formidable version, Ninja's 8-quart (two 4-quart baskets) is our top pick. It sports tons of power at a great price. As with the single-basket Ninja, this machine feels rock solid, and the baskets slide in firmly with no wiggle.\nWho is it for:\nThis is the perfect air fryer for those who regularly cook for big groups. You can make double batches of wings or cook two recipes at once for a full meal without having to do it in batches or worry about overcooking one of the recipes.\nWho should avoid it:\nThis is a massive air fryer and will dominate whatever part of the countertop you keep it on. If you don't regularly cook for large groups, opt for one of the smaller, less expensive models on our list. This dual-basket model also has a smaller 6-quart model (two 3-quart baskets) and a massive 10-quart version (two 5-quart baskets) available.\nWant more info? Check out our full review of the Ninja Foodi Dual-Basket air fryer.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025\nThe Ninja Crispi glass air fryer was tested and added as best air fryer overall\nThe Ninja 4-quart air fryer was tested and added as the best air fryer under $75\nThe Our Place Wonder Oven was tested and added as the best air fryer and toaster oven\nCompare air fryers\n| Air fryer | Size | Wattage | Controls | Cooking modes | Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ninja Crispi glass air fryer | 4 quarts | 1,500 | Digital | Air fry, recrisp, reheat, mac crisp | $160 |\n| Ninja 4- or 6-quart air fryer | 4 quarts | 1,550 | Digital | Air fry, roast, reheat, dehydrate | $69 |\n| Dash 2-quart air fryer | 2 quarts | 1,500 | Analog | Air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate | $50 |\n| Ninja Foodi DualZone air fryer | 8 quarts (total) | 1,690 | Digital | Air fry, broil, bake, dehydrate, roast, reheat | $200 |\n| Instant Pot Duo Crisp | 6 quarts | 1,000 | Digital | Pressure cook, slow cook, air fry, roast, steam, bake, broil, warm, saut\u00e9 | $150 |\n| Breville Smart Oven Air | 0.8 cubic feet | 1,800 | Digital | Toast, broil, bake, roast, warm, pizza, air fry, reheat, slow cook | $350 |\nOther air fryers we tested\nDreo Chefmaker: This souped-up air fryer has a built-in thermometer and tons of smart features. It works ggreen t but I found myself just using the basic air fryer function which makes it hard to justify the $359 price.\nDash Tasti-Crisp: I don't have major complaints with this model's function, but it feels a little flimsy for $60.\nCrux Marshmello: This compact 3-quart air fryer did well in testing and the cooking basket was easy to clean. I wasn't a fan of the control panels, which sport cutesy LED images in place of words, and it wasn't abundantly clear what each one was for.\nPhillips air fryer: I had no issues with this air fryer and liked the sleek design and intuitive controls. It performed similarly to the Ninja 4-quart but that model, our top budget pick, costs $100 less.\nPowerXL Air Fryer: This is another small air fryer that did well in testing, but I prefer the controls and sleek design of the more budget-friendly Gourmia 2-quart.\nInstant Vortex: One popular option is the Instant Vortex. It's priced in line with the other air fryers in this group. The Vortex is made by the same company that created the groundbreaking Instant Pot electric pressure cooker. Despite that, I wasn't blown away by its results. Chicken wings and fried chicken were acceptable but not incredible and less juicy than what other fryers produced. My Brussels sprouts ended up overdone too, and frozen fries cooked unevenly.\nDash Compact Air Fryer: We found the Dash Compact Air Fryer to be underpowered. While the larger Dash Deluxe is a powerhouse, the Dash Compact struggled to air-fry almost everything we put inside it. Both french fries and Brussels sprouts were under-done and unevenly cooked. The only bright spot was chicken wings. They took 30 minutes, but I was treated to skin with some crunch.\nGoWise USA 8-in-1 Digital Air Fryer: You may not have heard of this brand, but this offering from GoWise is a solid choice. It didn't cook the skin of my chicken wings evenly. That said, french fries came out crispy and crunchy, with fluffy interiors. The fryer also roasted Brussels sprouts well, no mean feat for this group of appliances.\nChefman 3.5 qt. Analog Air Fryer: Another relatively affordable choice is the Chefman Analog Air Fryer. It's tiny, too, offering just 3.5 quarts of food-frying capacity. The appliance delivered decent chicken wings, but it undercooked the Brussels sprouts and frozen french fries. We also found the Chefman's timer control confusing. This dial is labeled in numerical increments of 10. The numbers are separated by groups of four dots, not nine, as you would expect.\nPowerXL Vortex Air Fryer: You might consider purchasing the PowerXL Vortex, but we recommend against it due to its steep price and mediocre frying performance. We had satisfactory results cooking chicken wings in it, but this machine overcooked Brussels sprouts, and the french fries were just OK.\nDeLonghi Rapid Crisp: The DeLonghi Rapid Crisp was one of the most expensive models we tested, and it just didn't live up to the price tag. While I liked the design and sturdy build and appreciated the small viewing window for watching the cooking progress, I found the buttons and interface clunky. There was no way to set an actual cooking temp, only presets, and even those weren't very intuitive.\nBeautiful Air Fryer by Drew Barrymore: This air fryer offering from the actor's new kitchen line performed well in the four rounds of testing. It showed good power and cooked chicken wings to a nice crispy outside and kept them juicy inside after about 25 minutes. The air fryer's interface is slick, although I liked the Ninja's simpler control panel more, which is one of a few reasons it edged out this unit for best air fryer overall. This is a great option and is about $30 cheaper than the Ninja. It also has a pleasing design with smooth matte plastic (which does smudge a bit).\nHow we test air fryers\nTo date, we've tested well over a dozen air fryers to curate this list. Each air fryer is evaluated for its power, consistency, ease of use, design, features and overall performance. In total, we've logged results for more than 20 air fryers and over 75 hours of air fryer testing.\nThere are hundreds of recipes that can be made with an air fryer but we stuck to the basics and focused on the most popular foods people associate with air fryers. Chicken wings are at the top of that list, but french fries, frozen snacks and dense vegetables -- in this case, Brussels sprouts -- are air fryer food staples. Before we began, we consulted each model's manual for relevant cooking directions. If the manual didn't provide specific instructions, we applied uniform procedures to each air fryer depending on the type of food we were preparing.\nFor chicken wings, we followed a basic air fryer recipe. First, we preheated the air fryer to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and cooked them for 25 minutes in the basket with the included tray, then checked on them and turned them every 8 minutes. Most of the air fryers we tested had a solid showing in the wing test, although some, including the powerful Ninja and Cosori Lite models, got the wings a bit crispier in that amount of time.\nFor Brussels sprouts, we preheated the ovens to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and cooked them for 15 minutes. Before cooking, we rinsed and cut the sprouts in half and tossed them with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. In this test, some ovens struggled to brown the outside of the sprouts, but most got there eventually.\nFor the french fry test, we opted for Alexia's frozen crinkle-cut fries and cooked 1 cup, according to the air fryer directions on the bag. Quick note: Be careful when cooking fries in an air fryer as some types, especially thinner-cut fries, can dry out easily when hit with super-convection. We recommend heftier waffle fries, tater tots, crinkle cut or potato wedges over the shoestring variety.\nAt the end of each test, we looked for how evenly the items were cooked, if they were cooked through and whether they had a sufficient level of crispy, crunchy, fried goodness comparable to deep frying or pan frying.\nEase of use\nBeyond cooking performance, how easy an air fryer is to operate and how intuitive the buttons and controls were something we observed closely during testing. Overly complicated settings, controls and presets didn't generally result in high marks, but certain features were appreciated. All air fryers have base-level control over the temperature and cook time, although some are controlled digitally while others require the crank of simple manual dials. From there, you'll find preset programs for various foods such as wings, fries, fish, veggies and even baked goods.\nHow well they cook\nTo get a sense of how each air fryer in this test group handles, we ran a battery of three tests on each model. Each test focused on one food: chicken wings, Brussels sprouts and frozen french fries.\nWhat health experts say about air fryers\nThe Cleveland Clinic: \"They [air fryers] won't magically remove the saturated fat from bacon or the trans fats from a bag of processed chicken wings. To reap the benefits, reach for better-for-you options like vegetables and lean proteins....Think of the air fryer as a way to enhance healthier foods, so they're even more tempting.\"\nMedical News Today: \"Research on the effects of air-fried food is promising. Air fryers appear to be a healthy alternative, offering flavors similar to fried food with fewer adverse effects.\"\nBritish Heart Foundation: \"If you often eat deep-fried foods, switching to an air fryer could be helpful.\"\nBuying guide: What to consider when choosing an air fryer\nAn air fryer can bring efficiency and simplicity to your nightly meal routine. It's easy to make a quick and delicious meal with the best air fryers in your kitchen. They are not only healthier than an oven but also use less energy. Check out the complete guide to air fryers to learn more about these great kitchen appliances.\nPod-shaped air fryers vs. air-frying toasters\nWhile the idea of a toaster oven that doubles as an air fryer is a good one, and the air frying function on many of the hybrid machines is proficient, certain foods we love cooking in an air fryer are too messy to cook in a toaster.\nAll pod air fryers have removable cooking baskets and most of them are nonstick. When you're cooking chicken thighs with a sauce or even veggies drizzled with oil -- a few favorites -- there is going to be some inevitable splatter. Air frying mode is intense, with high convection heat circulated at a fast pace. Do this in a toaster oven, which is markedly more difficult to clean, and you'll be dealing with some serious caked-on gunk after the first few dozen uses.\nPod air fryers, on the other hand, take very little effort to get clean. Most air fryer baskets are now thicker and also nonstick. Beware of thin wire baskets, which can be tougher to clean. Both types can be removed to soak in the sink and some can be run through the dishwasher. The same can't be said for the inside walls of a countertop oven.\nIf you're buying a toaster oven, there's no reason not to get one with an air fryer function. It can still be used for less splatter-prone foods such as potatoes, frozen empanadas and filets of salmon with too much risk of making a mess.\nFor more, read CNET's complete guide to air fryers.\nAir fryer size\nWhile there are several features to consider, the size of your air fryer is likely the most important decision you'll make. If you're typically cooking for one or two people, a 2- or 3-quart air fryer should be large enough. Consider adding another quart of capacity to your air fryer for every person that you're regularly cooking for.\nA family of four or five, for instance, should be fine with a 5-quart model. If you plan on regularly cooking full meals for a family, including meat and veggies or sides, you might consider a larger, dual-basket air fryer like the Ninja DualZone.\nAll that said, the smaller the air fryer you can get away with the better. I've found that smaller air fryers such as the Magic Bullet 2- to 5-quart model and Instant Pot's Duo Crisp net better results since food will get blasted faster and more often than inside a larger model. Smaller air fryers mean less overall capacity, so you may have to cook in batches.\nPower\nMost air fryers are somewhere between 1,200 and 1,800 watts. Larger air fryers typically have more wattage and smaller models have less. Your midrange 4-quart air fryer should have about 1,500 watts. The small Magic Bullet and Gourmia air fryers have 1,300, but that's plenty of power to cook food in the petite basket. Larger air fryers should have about 100 more watts per quart to make sure they hit those hot temps of 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAir fryer accessories\nSome fancy models may come with extra accessories, but all you need is an air fryer basket with wire or nonstick grates. They come standard with most air fryer models and help the super-convection to hit all sides of your food evenly. I prefer the nonstick variety as wire baskets can be particularly tricky to clean.\nShould you just get a normal air fryer or a multifunction model?\nThat depends on the type of cooking you'll do and what other appliances you already have. I like having a solo air fryer, but I'm also a fan of the Instant Pot Duo Crisp which functions as both an air fryer and a multicooker (also a pressure cooker and slow cooker).\nConsider how the air fryer looks, too\nAir fryers don't have to be kept on the counter but anything larger than 3 quarts might be tricky to store when not in use. Considering that, you should get an air fryer that compliments your kitchen. Both the Ninja and Cosori models are available in a range of colors (Cosori has more). There are also glass bowl air fryers and more modern-looking machines.\nAir fryer FAQs\nHow do air fryers work?\nThe air fryer is a simple cooking machine that employs hot, fast-circulating convection heat and a small fan to flash-roast food inside a contained frying basket. While there's generally no or very little oil used, the results can be similar to those of traditional frying in that food comes out crispy on the outside and (ideally) moist on the inside.\nAre air fryers energy efficient compared to ovens?\nWe did an analysis and found that a standard 4-quart air fryer will cost about 27 cents per hour to run. That's 50% more energy-efficient than the average full-size electric oven and about 35% more efficient than the average gas oven.\nWhat can you make in an air fryer?\nThe options for foods you can cook in an air fryer are vast, but some air fryer favorites include chicken wings, chicken tenders, french fries and mozzarella sticks. You can also make fish in an air fryer, including salmon, for a moist inside and roasted outer crust. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are great when made in an air fryer, as are certain vegetables like Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, onions, peppers and carrots.\nIs using an air fryer healthier?\nGenerally speaking, air frying is a healthy way to cook. Cooking with an air fryer means you'll get foods that taste like they've been fried but with little or no oil. You can make healthier chicken wings, French fries, and cheese sticks without deep-frying or pan-frying in oil. Some foods do best in an air fryer with a light coating of oil, but most don't require any. Air fryers have become popular in part because they allow people to eat snack-type foods but with far less fat, cholesterol, and fewer calories.\nCan you cook raw meat in an air fryer?\nAs long as the raw meat is fully defrosted, you can place and even cook it in an air fryer with very little trouble. However, we do recommend using baking paper under the meat (either by covering the tray, or cutting a fine piece of the paper to put under your food) so that the juice collected doesn't collect at the bottom of your air fryer."

      "text": "Give your summer that perfect chill with the best ice maker. A countertop ice maker can add nugget, bullet or cocktail ice to your favorite beverage. These makers are especially helpful if you don't have a built-in ice maker in your fridge or if you just want some fancy cubes on hand.\nOur Picks\nTo find the best ice makers to keep the party going, I tested 10 machines. The models I evaluated varied widely in price, ice type and size, so there are picks on this list to accommodate specific frozen water requirements. If you're a consummate host of big outdoor bashes (and where's our invite?) consider a large-capacity ice maker versus a smaller model with limited output.\nWhat's the best ice maker for 2025?\nAfter weeks of testing and lots of cold beverages, we found GE Profile's Opal 2.0 Nugget Ice Maker with water tank to be the best ice maker overall. The larger machine pumps out mountains (3 pounds to be exact) of chewable nugget ice that's perfect for icy spritzes, chilled lemonade and blends into smoothies with zero resistance.\nA version of this ice maker has been around for more than a decade -- we tested the first generation model in 2016 and liked it then -- so we have faith it'll stand the test of time, which is key for an appliance type that's not known for longevity.\nBut there are other ice makers made for smaller spaces or specialty cocktails that could be a better fit for your summer soiree. Read on for our picks for the best ice makers for 2025.\nBest ice makers for 2025\nPros\n- Makes crunchy nugget ice, great for chewing or cocktails\n- The large removable water means you don't have to constantly refill\n- Quiet and easy to use\n- The design is pleasing\nCons\n- One of the most expensive nugget ice makers on our list\n- Larger than most so it might not fit on your kitchen counter\nWhy I like it:\nThe Opal Nugget 2.0 ice maker had one of the fastest ice outputs of the models we tried. It also has the largest capacity, able to hold three pounds at once and produce more than 35 pounds of ice in a single day. The large .75-gallon side water reservoir on the 2.0 comes in handy when you're hosting and don't want to bother with refilling constantly. The Opal is also relatively quiet and easy to use.\nWhy we chose this model over GE's other Opal ice makers is the removable reservoir that is far more convenient than the built-in water tank found on the brand's other models.\nWho is it for:\nIf you need large quantities of ice and have the space to house it, the Opal will provide the most ice to keep drinks cold and party guests happy. The Opal has a pleasant design and an easy-access bin with a caddy for the ice scoop on the side so you never lose it.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf you don't require loads of ice regularly, the Opal may be more ice maker than you need. It's significantly larger than the other ice makers on our list so it may not be the best pick if you plan to keep it in the kitchen. It also costs about $579 so it's not a budget buy.\nNote: Our pick is for the Opal 2.0. The Opal 2.0 XL is identical except for a slightly larger 1-gallon reservoir but costs $149 more. There is also a line of Opal ice makers with a built-in reservoir, which is less convenient to fill than the removable reservoir.\nPros\n- Made ice faster than any other nugget ice maker we tested\n- Simple to use\n- Classic design with several colors available\n- Good value considering the performance\nCons\n- The ice bucket feels a little cheap\n- No holder for the ice scoop\nWhy I like it:\nThis simple nugget ice maker quickly and efficiently turned 2 quarts of water into crunchy ice. It isn't decked out with special features like others on this list but it has a cleaning cycle that is recommended to run with distilled vinegar every so often to keep scale from building up.\nI appreciated the removable reservoir, which allows you to keep the machine anywhere in the kitchen. Those with built-in water tanks must either be placed near the sink or you'll have to find a vessel to bring water over to refill.\nWho is it for:\nThis ice maker is quiet, works well and is a modest size, making it a great pick for most kitchens. It will take up about the same amount of space as a 4-quart air fryer so you'll need to budget some counter space. That said, it's roughly half the size of the GE Profile Opal.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf your ice needs are particularly great, this mid-sized model may not be able to keep up. Two and a half pounds of ice may sound like a lot, but during a summer party with 10 or more guests, it'll go fast. A full batch of ice takes about an hour, so you can expect to fill it somewhat regularly throughout your event.\nPros\n- My favorite design of any ice maker we tested\n- Love the top-open door revealing ice bin and water tank\n- Keeps ice super cold after making it\n- Quiet operation\nCons\n- Smart features seem mostly unnecessary\n- Digital screen is busy\n- Less familiar with the brand, which makes me nervous about longevity\nWhy I like it:\nThis ice maker had my favorite design of all the models tested. The slick top-open door reveals an ice basket and easy-fill removable reservoir. The Ecozy also made its soft nugget ice fast, churning out 2.5 pounds in just more than an hour. It makes slightly less ice per day than the Frigidaire but still enough for the average household not to fall behind.\nThe Ecozy's smart features are fun, but I didn't find myself using them often. The ice maker is Wi-Fi enabled so you can start and stop the cycle remotely if you choose. However, you'll still have to return to manually fill the reservoir so remote control isn't a major boon.\nThis machine sports an LED light to show ice bin fullness without opening it. It also tells you the air and water temperatures but I struggled to see how this would be helpful other than to plan how long the ice would keep from melting. The insulated chamber was useful as this machine kept its ice frozen for several hours after it was made, even when I turned it on.\nWho is it for:\nSmart home aficionados will appreciate the Ecozy's extra features, such as app control and temperature readouts. While it doesn't filter water, the machine also reads the water's total dissolved solids, so you can haul in a separate filter system if the quality is poor.\nWho should avoid it:\nMy biggest concern with this ice maker is my lack of familiarity with the brand. Because it sports all those smart features, there are more elements that could potentially break or glitch over time, although everything ran smoothly in my weeks-long test.\nPros\n- A bargain at less than $100\n- Made bullet ice fast and kept it cold\n- Handle is convenient for bring ice outside or to another room\nCons\n- Makes a small amount of ice\nWhat I like:\nThe Igloo is about as simple as ice makers get but it made bullet ice fast and kept it frozen. The ice maker is relatively quiet and takes up very little counter space. I loved the handle that lets you easily lug a full batch of ice, which takes about an hour to make, outside or into another room.\nIt also made its first ice cubes faster than any machine, churning out nine cubes in less than 8 minutes.\nWho is it for:\nFor those who need just a small supplemental supply of ice, the Igloo's $95 machine won't bust your wallet or crowd your counter. It works consistently\nWho should avoid it:\nThis is a small-capacity ice maker. It holds just 1.25 pounds of ice and makes only 26 pounds total per day so you'll need to run and refill it often to keep up with even modest demand from a group. You can always batch ice and stick it in the freezer, but that requires planning ahead so consider this machine's output before you decide to buy.\nPros\n- The 2-inch cubes made by this machine were a thing of beauty\n- Slow melting ice is perfect for cocktails and sipping liquor\n- Small footprint\nCons\n- It takes eight hours to make four cubes\n- Expensive at more than $500\nWhy I like it:\nThe Klaris specialty ice maker makes perfectly clear 2-inch cubes of ice. While it takes time to make them, the resulting ice is optimal for sipping a fine whiskey or bourbon cocktail. The ice melts considerably slower than other types and thus won't water down your custom cocktail. It's also visually appealing if you plan to show off your cocktails on Instagram.\nWho is it for:\nThis is undoubtedly a specialty ice maker for fans of premium liquor with some money to spend. The Klaris makes four large crystal-clear ice cubes in each batch but takes about 8 hours to do it. It's easy to operate with just one button. The Klaris is also one of the smaller ice makers so it won't crowd your countertop and can ornament a home bar.\nWho should avoid it:\nThis isn't a practical ice maker for most people. The Klaris makes perfect cocktail ice but it takes eight hours to create just four cubes. It's also one of the more expensive home ice makers on the market at more than $500.\nOthers ice makers we tested\nFrigidaire Ball: This $335 model would be a good pick if you want cocktail ice but don't want to splurge on the $500 Klaris. The balls of ice were at times inconsistent or half-made but it was mostly efficient and easy to use.\nWhynter Nugget Ice Maker: This machine performed well but it was louder than the others. Also, the build is low and wide -- most were taller but narrow -- making it more difficult to squeeze into a crowded kitchen.\nGoveeLife Smart Ice Maker: This ice maker was the worst of the bunch. The Govee never produced a single cube after several attempts at running a cycle.\nGevi V2.0 Nugget Ice Maker: The Gevi performed OK when making ice but it didn't keep that ice frozen in the bin for as long as the others.\nCuisinart Compact Bullet Ice Maker: This bullet ice maker got the job done but the control panel was fussy and the price was bloated for a basic ice machine. The Igloo, our budget pick, is a nearly identical machine but costs $100 less.\nIce makers compared\n| GE Opal Nugget Ice Maker | Frigidaire Gallery Nugget Ice Maker | Ecozy Smart Nugget Ice Maker | Igloo 26-lb Bullet Ice Maker | Klaris Cocktail Ice Maker | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Type | Nugget | Nugget | Nugget | Bullet | Large cubes |\n| Dimensions | 17.5\"D x 13.43\"W x 16.5\"H | 16.75\"D x 11.75\"W x 20.25\"H | 9.33\"D x 14.01\"W x 15.51\"H | 12.2\"D x 9.06\"W x 12.8\"H | 9\"D x 9\"W x 12\"H |\n| Bin capacity | 3 lbs | 2.5 lbs | 2.6 lbs | 1.25 lbs | 4 cubes |\n| Ice made per day | 38 lbs | 44 lbs | 40 lbs | 26 lbs | 12 cubes |\n| Removeable water tank | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |\n| Special features | Large water tank | 4 colors available | Mobile app control, water quality monitor | Handle for easy transport | Makes clear cocktail ice |\n| Price | $536 | $300 | $400 | $90 | $549 |\nThere aren't a ton of ice makers from well-known brands.\nKitchen brands don't seem to be clamoring to get into the ice maker space and plenty of brands have skipped out on the category. I asked reps from several of my favorite kitchen brands why but most didn't have an answer.\nIn researching the models we would test, I reached out to some of them. A rep from SharkNinja, a kitchen brand we are consistently impressed with, said, \"We aren't in that category at the moment but we're always looking for the next consumer problem to solve \u2026 and always follow our deep consumer insights in that process.\"\nHow we tested ice makers\nTesting ice makers isn't as straightforward as some of the other products we evaluate at CNET. Most of the ice makers we brought in for testing delivered on the promise to turn tap water into ice. But some made ice faster than others and kept it cool for longer when the machine was turned off.\nMany of our picks hinged less on hard metrics gleaned from testing and more on how well the ice makers were designed and constructed, how easy they were to use, their features and their noise level. We ran each ice maker more than 10 times to ensure consistency in production and looked for any glitches in the controls. We also looked for leaks or design flaws that might cause a mess to clean up later.\nFor hard metrics, we timed how long it took each ice maker to make it's first cubes. We ran that test twice and averaged the two times. In most machines, it was consistently about 10 minutes before the first cubes or nuggets dropped into the bin.\nNext, we tested how long it took each ice maker to fill its bin. This isn't an apples-to-apples comparison because the machines all have different capacities but we wanted to see if the ice makers delivered on the promises made in marketing lingo.\nWhat to consider: Ice maker buying advice\nA removable reservoir\nThe most convenient feature of all the ice makers I tested was a removable reservoir. Some of the budget models had built-in water tanks, which meant you had to either keep the machine near the sink or bring water in a separate vessel to fill it.\nThe removable reservoirs proved uniquely handy for refilling, especially for the midsized machines that required more refills to keep up with demand.\nIce type\nMost at-home ice makers make one of two types of ice: bullet or nugget. Nugget ice can be made quickly and is great for chewing on but it melts fast in drinks. Bullet ice seems to be the go-to ice type for budget-friendly ice makers. It's more similar in structure to ice you would find in an in-fridge ice maker.\nThen there are the specialty ice makers, largely designed for cocktail making. Frigidaire has a $300 ball ice maker, while Klaris' $524 ice maker makes perfect, air-pocket-free blocks for sipping your favorite brown liquor or mixed drink.\nSize and production volume\nThe smallest ice makers are good for crowded kitchens but the production is limited so it might not be worth even the meager space they take up. The Cuisinart and Igloo, for instance, hold just 2 pounds of ice, enough for roughly 7 drinks.\nMost ice makers hold about 2 liters, which equals roughly 2.5 pounds of ice, good for about nine drinks. The bigger ice makers, including our top pick, the GE Profile Opal Nugget ice maker, hold 3 pounds at once, enough for 12 drinks, but the footprint on your counter is significantly bigger.\nOne thing to note is that the overall size of the ice maker doesn't guarantee it will produce more ice per day than a smaller machine, only that it makes more in one full cycle. The GE Opal, for instance, makes a few pounds less per day than the Ecozy and Frigidaire if you were to continuously fill them for 24 straight hours. The benefit of having a bigger machine is that you won't have to refill it as often.\nYou'd be wise to consider the space where you plan to put your ice maker before you purchase. Many homes may only require extra ice in the summer, so if you can budget the space for three or four months only, you can spring for a larger model that produces more. If it's going in the basement or garage to replenish ice as needed or to be pulled out for special occasions, size may not be a concern.\nCost and value\nThe most affordable ice makers we tested were less than $100. All of these models were small in stature and made bullet ice -- similar to ice from a fridge ice maker. Ice makers that produce nugget ice, which is easy to chew and looks nice in cocktails, typically start at about $300. Premium ice makers, such as the Opal 2.0 and Klaris specialty ice maker, cost about $500 to $700.\nCleaning mode\nMost of the ice makers we tested have a cleaning function that sends water mixed with a food-safe cleaning product or a vinegar solution through the channels to descale. We recommend buying an ice maker that has this feature to prevent tainted ice down the line.\nIce maker FAQs\nWill an ice maker work outside in the heat?\nIn my experience, ice makers function far less efficiently in the heat. If you have a portable ice maker, it's best to operate it inside where it's cooler during warm weather.\nHow do you clean an ice maker?\nTo clean an ice maker unplug the machine and empty the ice bin and water reservoir. Next, wipe down interior and exterior surfaces with a mild cleaning solution. For a deeper clean, run the machine's cleaning cycle once or twice to rid the lines of buildup. The run another cleaning cycle with only water to flush it out.\nHow long does an an ice maker take to make ice?\nMost automatic ice makers we tested start making ice in about 12 minutes but take a full hour or longer to make a full batch. The larger models took longer to fill the bucket with ice.\nHow much ice do ice makers make?\nMost of the ice makers we tested hold between 2.5 and 3 pounds of ice, enough for 8 to 12 drinks. The smaller, more budget-friendly machines hold closer to 1 pound.\nWhat to consider\nA removable reservoir\nNot all models have it but it makes life easy.\nIce type\nChewable nugget and bullet are the most popular types of ice made by these countertop machines.\nSize and production\nHow much ice you regularly need should inform the ice maker you buy.\nCost and value\nIce makers start at $100 and go well over $500 for premium models."

      "text": "I've got a ton of reasons to love my air fryer. It's fast, super convenient and cranks out crispy, delicious food without much effort. Plus, unlike gas ovens, it doesn't mess with your indoor air quality. The best part? You don't have to drop more than $100 or $150 to get a great one.\nLately, I've found yet another reason to be obsessed with the smaller, faster, countertop convection oven: it helps me save on energy.\nCurious about how much you can actually save using an air fryer instead of a regular wall oven? I crunched some numbers. Turns out, air fryers use about half the energy as a traditional oven. That's not even counting the fact that they cook food faster and don't need much (if any) preheating.\nHere's a look at how I came up with those numbers and what kind of savings you might see by swapping your oven for the air fryer.\nCost of oven versus air fryer\n| Gas oven | Electric oven | Air fryer | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Cost per hour of cooking | 40 cents | 52 cents | 25 cents |\nHow much energy does an air fryer use?\nThe exact savings will be different for everyone since energy prices vary depending on where you live in the U.S. Plus, ovens aren't all the same\u2014newer ones are usually more efficient and use less gas or electricity. For this little breakdown, we're going to use some averages and rough estimates to get an idea of how much you could save by choosing the air fryer over the oven. And honestly, cutting energy costs is just one of many reasons we think air fryers are totally worth it.\nSo how did we get these numbers? The easiest way to figure out how much an air fryer might save you versus a big oven was to calculate the wattage pulled per hour versus how much an electric stove would use. The same goes for a gas oven, although for that you need to figure out the amount of natural gas used for a stove as well as the cost of natural gas in your state.\nDon't worry. We did the hard part.\nHow much energy do wall ovens use?\nDepending on what type of oven you have, gas or electric, operating costs will vary since natural gas prices and electricity costs vary rather dramatically by state and service provider. Both use a similar amount of energy and have somewhat similar upfront costs, if you own an older oven there's a good chance it's less energy-efficient than a newer model.\nHow much energy does a gas oven use?\nTo calculate the operating cost of your gas stove and oven, we take the energy rating of the oven in Btu and divide it by 100,000. Multiply the result by the cost per therm of natural gas in your state, which varies greatly, then multiply by the number of hours the oven is used. You should be able to find the energy rating of your oven online if you know the model name or number. It is likely somewhere on the unit itself. If you still have the owner's manual, you can find the energy rating there, measured in Btu.\nTo calculate the operating cost of an 18,000-Btu oven, you'll divide 18,000 by 100,000, giving you 0.18. We'll also need to find the average price per therm of natural gas in your state. This chart has the most recent prices via the US Energy Information Administration. Note that this chart is listed in dollars per thousand cubic feet, so you'll need to divide by 10. For instance, if the chart price is $23, you'll use $2.30 to calculate the cost.\nIn New York where I live, the price is currently $2.20 per therm (about average for the US). Next, we'll multiply that price for a therm by the number you calculated in the last step (0.18 in this example) to get the operating cost per hour of using your gas oven.\nFor me, it would cost about 40 cents per hour to run an 18,000-Btu oven. If I were to run an oven for 1 hour per day, it would cost $146 per year. In some states (including Georgia, Florida and Ohio), natural gas is about 30% higher than the national average. In Hawaii, it's more than double.\nHow much energy does an electric oven use?\nTo determine electric stove consumption you'll calculate the wattage pulled per hour of cooking. Most electric ovens draw around 3,000 watts, depending on the temperature. Once you find the wattage of your oven via the appliance tag, owner's manual or an online product listing, multiply that by the number of hours you use the oven each day (we'll use 1 hour for this calculation), then divide by 1,000 watts to find the kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity used.\nNext, find the average price per kWh of electricity in your state. For that, you can consult this chart that has the 2023 prices listed in cents per kWh. The prices for 2021 won't be released until December 2022, but if you do some web searching, you should be able to find the latest figures. Multiply that amount by the number you just calculated (3 kWh in this example) to determine your operating cost per day.\nWorking with New York's current electricity rate of 18 cents per kWh, a 3,000-watt oven would cost about 54 cents per hour when run at high heat. If I used my oven for roughly 1 hour per day for one year that would equal roughly $197 per year. This cost doesn't include energy used by the range and burners.\nHow much energy does an air fryer use?\nAir fryers are electric appliances, so we can use the same methodology as above to find the operating cost. The wattage for air fryers varies and larger models will use more energy, but a standard 4-quart fryer such as this Ninja (our top-rated model) uses about 1,500 watts.\nConsidering that's exactly half the wattage pull of the average full-size oven from our stove calculation, we can project that the air fryer will use roughly half as much electricity to operate.\nUsing New York's electricity prices, we safely say a standard 4-quart air fryer will cost about 27 cents per hour to run. That's 50% more energy-efficient than the average full-size electric oven and about 35% more efficient than the average gas oven (calculated with New York state's average energy costs).\nHow much money can you save using an air fryer?\n- Cost of 300 hours of cooking with a gas oven on high heat: $153\n- Cost of 300 hours of cooking with an electric oven on high heat: $162\n- Cost of 150 hours of cooking with an air fryer: $40\nThese numbers are a rough estimate, of course. The numbers will vary based on your state's energy cost, how much cooking you do in a year, what temperature you're cooking at and the type and size of oven you're using.\nThat's only half of the equation. Air fryers are even more energy- and cost-efficient than these raw numbers illustrate.\nHere's why\u2026\nAir fryers cook faster than big ovens\nBecause of the smaller cooking chamber and superconvection (intense fan blowing heat into food), air fryers generally cook foods much faster than your traditional gas or electric stove, often in about half the time it takes to make a similar recipe in a full oven.\nBelow are some examples of cooking times for air fryers versus stoves. The cooking website Taste of Home compiled a list of average air fryer cooking times for popular foods. We compared those with standard cooking times pulled from Food Network recipes for oven-baked or oven-roasted versions of those foods.\nCooking times: Air fryer versus oven\n| Food | Temperature | Air fryer cooking time (mins) | Oven cooking time with preheat (mins) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Chicken thighs | 400 F | 20-25 | 40 |\n| Chicken wings | 375 F | 10-12 | 40 |\n| Chicken breast | 375 F | 23 | 30 |\n| Salmon | 400 F | 5-7 | 12-15 |\n| Brussels sprouts | 350 F | 15-18 | 40 |\n| Bacon | 400 F | 5-10 | 20 |\n| Cauliflower | 400 F | 10-12 | 20 |\n| French fries (from scratch) | 400 F | 10-20 | 40-45 |\n| French fries (frozen) | 400 F | 6-8 | 18-20 |\nAir fryers don't need to preheat either\nDon't forget most air fryers also don't require any preheating time, making them even more efficient. The average full-size oven takes at least 10 minutes to preheat but usually more like 12 to 15 minutes. Preheating requires as much (or more) energy as actual cooking. In the chart above, I added a modest 10 minutes to each of the oven cooking times to account for preheating.\nIf you consider that an air fryer does the work of an oven in half the time (even faster when you include preheat time), 300 hours of cooking in a standard oven in a year would likely take fewer than 150 hours when done in an air fryer.\nBefore we get carried away\u2026\nAn air fryer is not a pound-for-pound replacement for an oven. There are plenty of foods that you probably won't want to cook in an air fryer. Others just plain won't fit in a standard air fryer. Certain models are spacious enough to cook a whole chicken, but for larger roasts, a Thanksgiving turkey or that Sunday lasagna -- not to mention most baking projects -- your air fryer may not be the best option.\nFor someone who doesn't bake much or cook whole turkeys and racks of lamb on the regular, an air fryer can shoulder a whole lot of the cooking that your more expensive, less energy-efficient oven has been handling.\nThe best reason to use an air fryer isn't the savings\nAn air fryer won't cook everything better than your oven, but there are some air fryer foods that a big oven can't touch. Because air fryers cook so fast and at high temps, foods like chicken wings, french fries and most frozen apps will get crispy on the outside without drying out inside the way they might when stuck in the large oven for 30 or 40 minutes.\nAs mentioned, air fryers don't require any preheating time either. Most of the models I've used are also extremely simple to operate, safe even for children to use and easy to clean.\nBonus: Air fryers are cheap\nYou can pay in the hundreds for an air fryer but many of the best ones we tested are less than that. You can pick up our favorite air fryer, the Ninja 4-quart, for $100, or cheaper if you find it on sale. Our favorite budget air fryer, the Gourmia 4-quart, can be found for just $60.\nIf you're curious, Instant Pots and multicookers also use significantly less energy than an oven. If you have an Instant Pot but no air fryer, you can snag the Mealthy air-frying lid for $85 or the Instant Pot's lid attachment for Instant Pot's lid for $50."

      "text": "Midsummer is the hottest time of year, and 2025 has delivered record-breaking heat waves across the US. With temperatures in three digits, the idea of standing in a hot kitchen might be driving you to consider take out. When it's outrageously hot outside, there are a few tricks that help you stay cool and deliver a delicious dinner for your family.\nRead more: Best Foods for Staying Hydrated During Hot Weather\nFrom choosing the right appliances to timing your cooking sessions just right, a few simple strategies is all it takes. Better still, these tricks will help keep the kitchen from warming up the rest of the house and sending your AC bill through the roof.\nHere are nine practical tips to keep your kitchen -- and you -- cool, even when the temperature outside is pushing triple digits.\n1. Prepare instead of cooking\nDon't want to heat up your kitchen? Don't cook. That doesn't mean you can't eat. Focus on no-cook, fresh foods, such as summer salads, ceviche, smoothies and cold noodles. Even slicing up fresh fruit or vegetables like cucumbers and melons can be a refreshing and healthy summer treat. No-cook foods help beat the heat in two ways: By not heating up your kitchen -- or your body -- as you consume them.\nWhen you do cook, limit your time in the kitchen with a helpful meal kit (these are the best meal kits for 2025). You'll likely still have to cook the food, but you'll do far less prep and spending less time in a sweltering kitchen is definitely a good thing. Most services offer lighter, no-cook meals during the summer, too.\nEssential gear for food prep\n2. Use an exhaust fan\nIf you're going to use your oven, make sure the exhaust fan is on full tilt whenever you do. Most people associate exhaust systems with limiting smoke, but these above-oven fans suck up a ton of heat too.\n3. Use your outdoor grill or pizza oven\nTake the heat out of the kitchen by cooking outdoors this summer. Barbecued grilled chicken or steaks are classics for the grill but don't forget you can grill summer favorites like corn on the cob or watermelon. You might be hot while you're outside using a grill or smoker to heat foods, but your kitchen can stay cool.\nEssential gear for grilling and outdoor cooking, all tested and reviewed.\n4. Use an air fryer or Instant Pot\nMinimizing use of the oven and stove can help you avoid heating up your kitchen. Small appliances can cook your food just as well while emitting less heat than large appliances. Try using an air fryer instead of your wall oven, or a panini press instead of the stovetop. You'd be surprised how versatile small appliances can be. Your slow cooker and Instant Pot aren't just for winter soups and stews. Think of summer recipes you can achieve on your countertop, like Instant Pot pork carnitas. Don't turn your nose up at your microwave, which can zap rice, quinoa, vegetables and more while generating practically no heat.\nKitchen appliances that keep your wall oven off\n5. Meal prep ahead of hot days\nIf you're going to heat up your kitchen, make it worth it. If you do end up using your oven or stovetop, make larger quantities than normal. That way, you can use precooked leftovers, which means you have food ready to go without heating up your kitchen again.\nWith the right kitchen appliances, you can batch cook and keep the oven off. For example, make a whole bunch of pulled chicken in your Instant Pot (which gives off very little heat). Then you can use the leftovers to make tacos, chicken salad nachos and other meals that don't require firing up your oven.\nBest gear for batch cooking\n- An Instant Pot Rival Worthy of Your Countertop\n- Instant Pots Are Heat Wave-Proof. These Are the Best to Use Instead of the Oven\n6. Cook during cooler hours\nCooking in your kitchen when it's already hot outside (and maybe already hot in your home) means you'll only add to the heat. Plan ahead and strategize your cooking times for when it's not as hot. The best time to cook to avoid the heat is in the morning or later in the evening. That might appear easier said than done, but you could bake bread in the morning, or cook proteins and pasta dishes while you're making breakfast or an early lunch so they'll be ready to go for dinner.\nMore cool kitchen tips\n- 6 Best Bread Machines, Tested and Reviewed\n- This TikTok Viral Feta Pasta Is Big for a Reason\n- How to Make Bacon in an Air Fryer\n7. Add some fans to the mix\nAirflow can help cool down your kitchen. If you're using your stove, turn on the range hood vent. It's there to remove not just grease, fumes and odors but smoke, heat and steam that could get trapped and heat up your kitchen while you're cooking. Plus, you can keep a fan on in the kitchen to move air around and cool it down. You can also position your fan to move hot air out, or bring cold air in with a cool, wet towel.\nWe're a fan of these\n- Best Tower Fans\n- There's an Ideal Place for Your Fan\n- Try This Ceiling Fan Hack to Save Big Money on AC Costs\n8. Limit bright lights\nSunlight and even artificial interior light can generate heat, and when you're in the heat of summer, every degree counts. Dim the lights, shut any curtains, close your blinds and limit how many lights you turn on. You don't need to work in the dark but be wary of turning on lots of overhead lights.\nSmart lights for a kitchen glow-up\n9. Keep yourself hydrated\nThis strategy won't lower the actual temperature in your kitchen but it will make the heat more bearable. Hydration is the No. 1 rule for most summer activities, and cooking outdoors or in a warm kitchen is no exception. Drink lots of water -- it's recommended to drink between 11 and 15 cups per day -- and sip even more than you think you should when the mercury rises.\nWant to punch it up a bit? Try water infusions for more flavor and refreshment. Planning to sweat? Add sea salt and lemon to boost electrolytes and flavor.\nHot tips to stay hydrated\n- Mastering Summer Hydration: Debunking Myths and Essential Tips\n- Best Reusable Water Bottles\n- Best Soda Water Makers\n- The 4 Best Water Filter Pitchers for 2025: Top Picks Tested\nFAQs\nHow can you remove heat from a kitchen?\nDevices like heat extractors help remove excess heat, smoke and airborne grease by venting hot air and fumes outside -- keeping your kitchen cooler and more comfortable."

      "text": "Groceries and dining out are only getting more expensive. I'm constantly in search of a great meal prep recipe and it doesn't get better than roasted chicken. During summer heat, roasting a whole chicken in the oven -- plus preheat time -- could raise the temperature in your house as much as 10 degrees F. On the other hand, an air fryer can help you cook a perfect roast chicken in under an hour without turning your already warm kitchen into a virtual sauna.\nDuring my decade-long tenure as a food and kitchen tech editor, the air fryer has been my most-used kitchen appliance. My latest obsession is using an air fryer to roast a whole chicken. An air fryer can cut cooking time by 15 to 20% -- and the skin will come out super crispy and with the nonstick basket, cleanup is a breeze.\nWhen it comes to lip-smacking meals, it's very hard to beat a well-roasted chicken. Add some root vegetables into the mix, slather on gravy and you get a proper Sunday dinner with leftover chicken you can eat for the rest of the week.\nTo make a perfect roasted chicken in about 45 minutes, all you need is an air fryer (4 quarts or larger,) a chicken of your choice and some simple spices and pantry ingredients. I'm well versed in the joys of air fryer cooking, but air fryer chicken is perhaps the best cool-weather cooking discovery I've made while tinkering with these trendy convection cookers. Let me show you how it all works.\nCan you really cook a whole chicken in an air fryer?\nYou sure can. The secret to great roasted chicken is high heat while not overcooking the bird for a crispy skin with moist, tender meat. An air fryer is the perfect vessel for this method since it envelops the food inside with hot quickly moving air and manages to crisp outer layers better than a full-size convection oven that features more widely dispersed heat. The smaller air fryer cooking chamber also means more consistent temps throughout a single session.\nAir fryers are typically smaller than wall ovens, but many models are capable of handling a 3- or 4-pound chicken. I cooked a full 4-pound roaster and it fit comfortably inside my Dreo 6-quart ChefMaker smart air fryer oven.\nRead more: Grill, Bye. Make Your Next Burger in an Air Fryer and Thank Me Later\nWhat size air fryer do you need to cook a whole chicken?\nThis fancy souped-up air fryer has a steam feature and smart cooking programs, but I didn't need or use them. I cooked the chicken on basic air fryer mode at 360 degrees Fahrenheit for 55 minutes, flipping the bird (ha!) after 25. You won't need a fancy air fryer, either. This $120 Instant air fryer will get the job done. As will this $80 Gourmia model.\nThere was minimal prep in this air fryer chicken recipe, which I adapted from a few found online and my go-to oven-roasted chicken recipe. I whisked together a quick marinade with olive oil, grain mustard, salt, pepper and some of my favorite Mediterranean seasoning blend. I stuffed the chicken with half of an orange, some green onion and a bunch of fresh parsley that was down to its final days in the fridge.\nWhat should you serve with roasted chicken\nI served the chicken with rice made in my speedy and effortless rice cooker, but I could have just as easily dropped some potatoes or other root vegetables in with the chicken and had myself with a full dinner to feed four or five -- all cooked in the confines of one nonstick air fryer basket.\nAir fryers cook fast so careful not to burn the skin\nMy only other note when making an air fryer bird is to keep a close eye on the chicken, especially toward the end. The heat from an air fryer is intense and could burn the skin if you have it cranked up too high or leave it in too long. If your skin seems to be getting brown faster than the chicken is coming to temp inside, pull back on the heat and continue monitoring.\nYou can always fire it up again once the meat is cooked to get a crispy skin before serving. You'll know the meat is cooked when a meat probe reads 160 degrees Fahrenheit when plunged into the thickest part of the breast.\nIngredients for air fryer roast chicken\n- 4-pound chicken, giblets removed\n- 3 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 tablespoons grain mustard\n- Seasoning blend (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Lemon or orange\n- Fresh herbs\nHow to make air fryer roast chicken\n- Preheat air fryer to 360 degrees Fahrenheit\n- Whisk olive oil, mustard, seasoning blend, salt and pepper together\n- Rub mustard marinade over the entire chicken\n- Place chicken in air fryer basket breast down on top of the wire rack and cook for 25 minutes\n- Flip the bird breast up and cook for the another 20 minutes\n- Remove when juices run clear or an internal thermometer reads 160 degrees Fahrenheit\n- Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Pour juices from the air fryer basket over sliced chicken or use to make a gravy"

      "text": "While it's unclear exactly what prompted a high-ranking member of US Consumer Product Safety Commission to suggest natural gas stoves may be regulated, or even banned, two worrying studies on the common kitchen fuel may be at the root of it all. A Harvard study from 2022 found natural gas to be more toxic than previously thought and also a propensity for stoves to leak harmful pollutants. Another scientific work published just this January linked natural gas stove use to childhood asthma at an alarming rate.\nIn Bloomberg's striking interview on Monday, CPSC commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. called natural gas stoves, which can be found in as many as 40% of US homes, a \"hidden hazard.\" \"Any option is on the table,\" he continued. \"Products that can't be made safe can be banned.\"\nAfter a firestorm of criticism and pushback, particularly from right-wing pundits, Trumpka quickly clarified his statement about a potential gas stove ban with a Twitter post, also on Monday, saying, \"To be clear, CPSC isn't coming for anyone's gas stoves. Regulations apply to new products.\"\nWhile Trumpka did not point to explicit data or sources in his initial interview, a study completed by Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health in June of last year may something to do with the advancing rhetoric around natural gas stove safety. The study found that natural gas used in homes contains far more toxins than previously thought, including nitrogen dioxide and methane, and that gas-powered kitchen stoves often leak, even when they're turned off, putting those in and around the kitchen at higher risk.\nA second more recent study from earlier this month concluded that as much as 12.7% of childhood asthma can be attributed to gas stove use. The work, which was published by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, found that the rates of asthma caused by gas stoves are even higher in certain states including Illinois (21.1%), California (20.1%) and New York (18.8%).\nThe 16-month Harvard study, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology in June 2022, took samples from 69 stoves in homes serviced by three different natural gas companies across the Boston area. Testing of the precombustion (unburned) methane gas found over 300 chemicals, including 21 airborne toxins. Those toxins notably included low levels of benzene, a known carcinogen, which was discovered in 95% of the natural gas tested.\nThe study also found that about one in 20 stoves (5%) had gas leakage when not in use that was sizable enough to recommend follow-up with an expert. The leaks were typically so small that they couldn't be detected by the human nose (natural gas is odorized for safety), but still could pose a potential health risk, according to Drew Michanowicz, a senior scientist at PSE Healthy Energy who worked on the study.\nIt's important to note that this study was intended only to identify potential human risk in using natural gas stoves and did not measure exposure levels of said air toxins or draw any conclusions as to what effects these low levels of exposure might have on health over time.\nIs your natural gas stove unsafe?\nIt's still too early to make grand or sweeping statements about health risks from using natural gas stoves, but the data from both studies signal that natural gas presents potential health hazards not previously known. More research is needed on exposure levels for the average person living with and using a gas stove. That said, natural gas used in the stoves that were tested proved to contain more harmful gasses than previously thought -- notably benzene -- which could pose a health risk if exposure to the unburned gas is great enough. That, coupled with gas stoves often leaking gas when not in use, could result in harmful health outcomes over time.\nHow to protect yourself from natural gas leaks\nWhile more research is needed to determine the true dangers of natural gas stoves, there are some steps you can take in the meantime to mitigate risk.\nMake sure your kitchen is well-ventilated with windows. If it's not a well-ventilated space or you're not able to keep windows cracked open, consider adding a simple fan to promote airflow. Air purifiers with charcoal filters remove harmful benzene and other air toxins. A basic model costs anywhere from $100 to $150. (Check out our picks for the best air purifiers.)\nHow to tell if your stove is leaking gas when not in use\nWhile the tiny leaks detected in the study are not likely to pose an immediate threat to your health, larger leaks can. If you suspect a gas leak in your home, contact your gas utility company immediately. They will send out a technician to investigate further and take care of any potential hazards, often at no charge to you.\nUse a gas detector\nA simple gas leak detector will help identify the presence of gas around your burner and give an idea roughly how much is leaking. Testing for a gas leak will give you some information to start. If there is in fact a leak, reach out to your gas company for help.\nNatural gas leaks will typically release carbon monoxide into the air which can cause poisoning and even death if it reaches high enough levels. Install a carbon monoxide detector or smart smoke and CO detector like the Nest Protect to make sure your home is not at risk.\nUse your nose\nNatural gas is treated with an odorant to help detect leaks so if you smell that unique smell when the burners are off, you might have an issue. But if the leak is small enough, you won't be able to smell it with just your nose and it still may be doing harm over time.\nMore oven intel\n- How Much Can You Save Cooking With an Air Fryer?\n- How to Place and Install Carbon Monoxide Detectors in Your Home\n- Review: Solo Stove Brings 'Brick Oven' Pizza to Your Backyard\n- Here's How Much Energy a Microwave Uses Compared with an Oven\n- A Guide to Air Fryers: Everything to Know Before You Buy\n- Try This Easy Hack to Safely Clean Oven Grease From Hard-to-Reach Places\n- Oven Not Heating Up?

      "text": "Air fryers have taken up a lot of oxygen in the kitchen contraption conversation these past few years. The buzzy countertop cookers are no longer new, so to speak, but you'd never know it with the way excitable air fryer owners talk about their favorite small appliance. Yes, myself included.\nIf you're just entering the chat, don't worry -- I've got all the air fryer know-how to catch you up in less time than it takes to make perfect salmon in an air fryer. I'll also discuss the types of air fryer ovens to help you find a match and explain how much you should pay for an air fryer (spoiler alert: not more than $100 for a basic model).\nFinally, I'll share some tips on what you should and shouldn't make in an air fryer so you can hit the ground running.\nBelow you'll find everything you need to know about air fryers before you buy one for your kitchen, dorm or RV.\nRead more: Air Fryers Are Perfectly Safe as Long as You Don't Do This\nWhat's an air fryer and how does it work?\nContrary to the name, an air fryer doesn't fry at all. Instead, the air fryer works more like a convection oven, circulating hot air with a fan into a compact cooking chamber. The main difference between a regular convection oven and an air fryer is that the air fryer fan blows faster and the compartment in which food is cooked is often (but not always) smaller. All that hot air hits food more rapidly than in a larger oven and thus doesn't lose as much oomph in transit. Most air fryers come with a grated rack or perforated basket so hot air can travel through and pummel the food from all sides.\nWhat's so great about air fryers?\nThis fast, hot roasting or \"super convection\" will quickly brown chicken, potatoes, frozen snacks, veggies and fish without overcooking the inside. That's very similar to how deep-frying works, which is where both the comparison and the name come from. While it isn't the case for everything, I've air-fried many foods that taste nearly identical to if they'd been deep-fried. In fact, some things taste better when air-fried since they aren't coated or saturated in oil which can overpower the flavor of the food.\nIs it healthier to use an air fryer?\nIt all depends on what you're making in your air fryer, but cooking something in an air fryer is almost universally healthier than deep-frying or pan-frying it in oil. Less oil typically means less fat and fewer calories too.\nWhat can you make in an air fryer?\nFoods that are at their most delicious when fried -- chicken wings, fried chicken, french fries, mozzarella sticks -- are often typically great candidates for an air fryer, too. You'll get similarly crispy and browned outsides with insides that don't overcook. But you can also make roasted vegetables such as zucchini, stuffed peppers, sweet potatoes and cauliflower in an air fryer in less time than it would take in a large oven. I even made a whole roasted chicken in the air fryer and it went pretty well.\nSome favorites to cook in an air fryer include \"fried\" chicken with the skin on; just a quick dredging of egg and seasoned flour and then 25 minutes on high. Brussels sprouts, frozen dumplings (with a light coating of oil), and seasoned mushrooms with chopped garlic are a few more easy sides and appetizers to make in an air fryer.\nSpeaking of appetizers, popular frozen foods such as bagel bites, premade chicken tenders, jalapeno poppers and fish sticks or crab cakes are excellent candidates for cooking in an air fryer.\nHere are seven foods I'll only make in the air fryer from now on.\nWhat shouldn't you make in an air fryer?\nAir fryers are extremely versatile, but there are a few foods that shouldn't go in an air fryer. Leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale will likely dry out and turn crispy in an air fryer. The same goes for broccoli, although you can avoid burnt broccoli by wrapping it in aluminum foil before sticking it in the air fryer.\nWhile not impossible, steaks are also tricky to successfully cook in an air fryer and tend to dry out. I don't recommend cooking any cuts of beef, especially good ones, in an air fryer. Save that for the grill or cast-iron skillet. Here are seven foods to avoid putting in the air fryer.\nRead more: Air frying vs. oven baking: Which cooking method is best?\nDo you need to use oil with an air fryer?\nShort answer: No, you don't need oil. But some foods do well with a light spray or coating of cooking oil. Vegetables, including green beans, broccoli, asparagus and even potatoes, will dry out if you blast them in an air fryer so a light spritz of avocado or olive oil can go a long way.\nRemember, you're still using far less oil than deep-frying or even pan-frying in which food sits in oil or is submerged the entire time it's cooking. Anything with some inherent oil content, like chicken or salmon, will have plenty of natural oil to baste itself while cooking.\nHow much do air fryers cost?\nLike anything else, you can pay a whole lot for an air fryer but in our experience, the most expensive air fryers aren't necessarily the best. A basic air fryer is not a complex machine so you needn't break the bank. Small no-frills air fryer models start at $25 or $30, and I've found they will do a serviceable job. That said, if you bump up another $30 or $40, you're going to get a better build, sharper look and generally a bit more power too.\nAt the high end are the hybrid countertop ovens with air fry functions. These can go as high as $300, but you can get less advanced models from bargain brands or ones that are on sale for around $150.\nWhat size air fryer should you get?\nIf you're cooking for one or two people a 2- or 3-quart air fryer should be large enough. From there, I would suggest adding a quart of capacity for every person that you're regularly cooking for. So, if you plan to air fry for five people, spring for a 5-quart model.\nSize matters when it comes to air fryer prowess but maybe not in the way you expected. A smaller air fryer means food is going to get blasted faster and more often than inside a larger model where the air has further to travel and more time to lose heat. I've found that small and powerful air fryers including the Magic Bullet 2-5-quart model and Instant Pot's Duo Crisp (which has a small air frying capacity once you load the air fry basket in) works exceptionally well and very quickly.\nThe smaller air fryers mean less overall capacity so you may have to cook in batches.\nUsing medium chicken thighs as a unit measurement, a 2.5-quart air fryer can fit three thighs. A 5-quart model will comfortably fit six thighs and so on. If you spring for a hybrid oven with multiple racks, you can cook as many as 10 or 12 chicken thighs at once, but it will take longer than with a smaller air fryer\nWhat are the different types of air fryers?\nSolo air fryer: Best for most people (and most budget-friendly)\nThe most basic of air fryers looks like a small robot. They are generally just a cylindrical base with a basket to hold the food that pulls in and out. These come as small as two quarts and can be as big as six or seven. These models come with digital controls or manual dials. There are also air fryers with dual compartments so you can make two types of food at different temps simultaneously. Ninja makes a particularly good one with two 4-quart cooking baskets (8 quarts overall).\nSolo air fryers are the least expensive too, and they can be had for as little as $30. I'd say if you just want to try air frying but don't want to commit a lot of money or kitchen space, opt for one of these.\nAir frying toaster oven: Bake, broil, roast and toast\nThese models look and function much like a standard countertop toaster oven but they have an air fry function as well. An advanced version is almost like adding a second main oven to your kitchen since they can broil, roast, bake, toast and much more. Some even come with a rotisserie function. For someone who hosts Thanksgiving or big family gatherings, the extra oven space these provide may feel like a godsend. Plus, they air fry; although due to their larger size, these models usually don't cook as quickly or quite as intensely as smaller solo air fryer ovens.\nBreville makes an excellent (and large) model as do KitchenAid and Cuisinart. My favorite in a test of these types air frying toaster ovens was Ninja's Foodi, which blasted chicken wings and french fries to crispy golden perfection -- I suspect that was large in part due to the smaller cooking cavity which helps the air fry function work properly. It also made wonderful broiled salmon and perfect toast.\nThese air fryers start at around $150 and go up from there.\nAir fryer and multicooker: An air fryer that does it all\nThese are the most advanced and versatile air fryers and they do a whole lot more than air fry. Think Instant Pot but with an air fryer function as well. Ninja's Foodi multicooker and the Instant Pot Duo Crisp are two popular models, and if you want an air fryer and multicooker or pressure cooker but don't have a lot of kitchen space to relinquish, one of these is a great option. I've used the 6-quart Duo Crisp a bunch and find it works well, turning out some of the most delicious fried chicken ever (with no frying at all.) These models generally retail for about $175 to $250\nYou can buy an air fryer attachment for your Instant Pot\nIf you already have an Instant Pot, you can buy a Mealthy air fryer lid ($94) that will clamp on top and air fry food down below. I found the air fryer lids work exceptionally well, although they don't have a large capacity for cooking.\nShould you get a digital air fryer over an analog? Meh, not really.\nThis depends on your personal preference but the controls don't have much to do with the performance or result. Digital air fryers have presets for things like chicken wings, french fries, fish and such, but I find that even if the presets exist, it takes me just a few runs to learn how long things need and the correct temperatures, and I end up bypassing them anyways. Digital air fryers tend to cost a bit more and you run the risk of the panel shorting out, but having a digital readout of the temp and cook time can be nice.\nWhich air fryer is best for you?\nAnother question that depends on your needs and budget. Fortunately, we've tested to find best air fryers in 2024 and the best air frying toaster ovens with picks in various sizes, styles and prices to help you decide."

      "text": "We're barely into summer and already the US has seen a devastating heat dome pushing temperatures to uncomfortable heights. And if you're hot, know that your phone is even hotter, which can make it turn off abruptly or potentially damage the battery.\nBut there's no need to get hot and bothered, especially when you know these easy ways to keep your iPhone or Android phone from overheating.\nSee also: What else can you do to keep cool? Here are more practical tips for your phone, plus ways to stay cool indoors.\nHead for the shade\nManufacturers like to boast about how bright their phone screens can get, allowing you to see your display clearly even in direct sunlight. Pushing the intensity of those pixels to 1,000 or 2,000 nits of peak brightness is great for reading what's on the screen, but sustaining that level uses more power and generates more heat than when you're inside or in the shade.\nPlus, direct sunlight delivers radiant heat to items like metal and glass, increasing the temperature of your device. If you need to use your phone for an extended period of time during sunny, hot days, find some shade to protect both it and you.\nDon't leave the phone in a hot car for extended time periods\nIf you don't want to expose the phone to the sun, what about keeping it in a car while you're frolicking on the beach? Setting aside the risk of having it nabbed in a break-in, cars turn into hotboxes on sunny days, which can easily push past the recommended operating temperatures. It's better to take the phone with you.\nWhich reminds me: I know you'd never leave a pet in a hot car, but they can get overheated elsewhere. Here's how to take care of your vulnerable furry friends.\nRemove the case while charging\nIt's normal for a phone to heat up while it's charging -- the phone's surface dissipates that heat away from the inside by design. But if you're using a bulky case, the heat could get trapped. If the phone seems to be heating up too much when plugged in, remove the case before charging.\nAvoid charging and using demanding apps at the same time\nHeat doesn't just come from the outside environment.\nYour phone's processor has to work a lot harder when you do something like play graphics-intensive games, which can generate more heat than usual from within your device.\nAnd playing these games can also drain your battery quickly, so it's natural to want to plug into power.\nHowever, this combination of high processing and charging increases the heat generation even more, leading to overheating.\nPause after recording video\nVideo recording is resource-intensive, capturing and storing multiple megabytes of data per second and usually processing that footage at the same time. Even expensive mirrorless cameras capable of shooting high-quality video hit thermal ceilings (or have add-on fans to dissipate the heat).\nIf you're recording lengthy clips, you may need to pause for a few minutes between them to allow the phone to cool down.\nBuy reliable chargers\nIt's just a power charger, so why not get the cheapest one? Be wary of amazingly low prices, because they're often attached to knock-off products that don't include safety electronics for regulating power throughput and preventing overheating.\nIt's better to pay slightly more and get a recommended USB-C charger or power bank that you know you can trust.\nUpdate the phone's operating system\nIt sounds like the worst sort of overly general advice: Make sure your device's software is up to date. And yet it's usually good advice, especially in this case.\nFor example, a bug in iOS 17, plus a problem with some apps, including Instagram and Uber, caused many iPhone 15 Pro phones to overheating. Apple soon released an update to fix the problem.\nNote that it's normal for a phone to warm up during and after a system update as the software optimizes data in the background. However, this is a temporary temperature elevation.\nAlso, if you're running prerelease software such as the iOS 26 beta or the latest Android 16 beta, it's not uncommon for phones to run a little hot because the software usually doesn't get optimized for battery life until just before launch.\nGet a thermal phone pouch\nIf you can't avoid the heat and often find yourself waiting for the phone to cool, consider buying an inexpensive thermal phone pouch to store it in. Using materials designed to protect astronauts from temperature extremes, a pouch will reflect direct sunlight and heat away from the phone. Thermal pouches also work at the other end of the spectrum, protecting your phone from cold weather, such as when you're skiing.\nGet the battery checked out\nIf overheating becomes a frequent problem -- and the phone isn't exposed to the other situations mentioned in this gallery -- a faulty or failing battery might be the cause.\nFirst, see what the phone is telling you: on the iPhone, go to Settings > Battery and check Battery Health. On Android, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Diagnostics (Pixel) or Settings > Battery information (Samsung). If the functionality is degraded, it might be time to schedule a battery replacement.\nAnd if the phone is bulging, cracked or shows other signs of a swollen battery, turn it off and contact the company's support programs immediately. That's a less likely circumstance, but with lithium-ion batteries, you don't want to mess around with safety."

      "text": "When the heat index climbs, turning on the oven feels like a bad idea. A countertop air fryer solves the problem. It cooks quickly, keeps the kitchen noticeably cooler, and still delivers that crisp, golden finish you want for weeknight dinners.\nI swapped a few sheet-pan meals for air fryer recipes during a warm stretch and the difference was immediate. No waiting for preheating, shorter cook times, and less lingering heat in the room. Cleanup took minutes, since the basket and tray went straight into the sink.\nIf your goal is fast summer dinners without heating the house, start here. These air fryer dishes keep things light on effort and heavy on flavor, with reliable results that make no-oven cooking an easy habit.\nWhat began as a glorified frozen-snack machine has turned into a full-on kitchen workhorse. The air fryer now handles everything from crispy chicken tenders to roasted veggies to gooey desserts. Beyond the staples, I've discovered a few surprising air fryer foods that I'm now completely hooked on.\nFrom whole-roasted chicken and flaky salmon to vegetables and sides, such as cauliflower, potatoes and carrots, certain foods feel like they were made to cook in an air fryer. You'll find a ton of Reddit threads with home cooks asking for the ultimate air fryer recipes and we've put together this guide to help you out with our favorites.\nLooking for something great to make? Check out the nine foods you absolutely have to cook in an air fryer below.\nAnd if you're searching for an air fryer or to upgrade your existing oven, we have a new favorite model with a glass cooking chamber that's easy to clean and doubles as a food storage container.\n1. Salmon\nBroiled salmon is a simple, healthy weeknight dinner staple. It's not difficult to make in the oven but if you're only cooking for one or two people, the preheating time is a pain and you'll waste a lot of energy for a small amount of food. Pan-seared salmon is great and quick, but there's almost no way to cook salmon on the stove without creating an oily and odorous mess.\nI tried cooking roasted salmon in the air fryer and it came out perfectly in about 10 minutes, including preheating time. The closed cooking chamber captures all of the grease and even hides some of the fishy smell from taking over the space.\nOK, so you might catch me throwing the occasional filet of salmon on the grill during warmer months, but gone are the days of me wiping fish grease from the backsplash behind my kitchen stove.\nHere's how to make perfect air fryer salmon.\n2. Whole chicken\nThis one surprised me the most because I make a roast chicken most Sundays and had become content with my method of using the oven. I learned fast that the air fryer does an even better job because it's able to crisp the skin quickly without overcooking the meat. Air-fryer roasted chicken takes about 45 minutes -- about 15% quicker than the oven -- and it's nearly impossible to screw up.\nHere's how to make a quick roasted chicken in the air fryer.\n3. Bacon cheeseburgers\nAir fryer cheeseburgers have become a staple around my home. The exception is during summer when the grill is in full swing but during cooler months, I turn to the air fryer for this American classic. It's not only cleaner than pan frying but the burger doesn't cook in its own grease so you get a lighter, healthier meal (if you're into that sort of thing). You can also stick the bun and a couple of slices of bacon in with the burger and you have the full meal with almost no cleanup to manage.\nHere's how to make a cheeseburger from top to bottom in the air fryer.\n4. Chicken cutlets\nBefore the air fryer, I used to pan-fry breaded chicken cutlets for chicken Parmesan and other recipes but the air fryer does the same job with less mess and produces less oily fried chicken, too.\nI recommend using boneless chicken thighs, which have enough fat content to withstand all that convection heat without drying out. Simply coat the chicken in beaten egg wash followed by bread crumbs mixed with salt, pepper and other spices. Cook at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes.\nYou can spray the cutlets lightly with a bit of oil before cooking to get an extra crispy crust but it's not necessary. I've tried the same method with chicken breasts; it works well but there is more risk of drying out the meat.\n5. Cauliflower steak\nOne of my favorite things to cook in the air fryer is cauliflower. A slab of cauliflower makes an excellent hearty side dish or main course if you're going plant-based. Simply toss a thick slice or two of cauliflower with olive oil and salt and pepper, or some seasoning of your choice, and air fry for 10 or 12 minutes on high. The air fryer gives it a beautiful caramelized crust and it cooks the dense veggie fast enough so that the inside of the cauliflower doesn't become mushy.\n6. Leftover pizza\nWhile not every type of food is best reheated in the air fryer, a lot of them are. Air fryers are the perfect way to revive leftover pizza, fried chicken, grilled meats and vegetables. A microwave heats food unevenly and tends to impart a rubbery texture. Air fryers give food a second life via convection heat for a crispy crust and even heating.\nHere's the best way to reheat every type of leftover.\n7. Hot dogs\nIt's hard to screw up a hot dog but if you want a perfectly charred wiener in less than five minutes with essentially no cleanup, look to the air fryer. Air fryer hot dogs are as simple as simple gets and the super convection oven gives them a perfect browning in two or three minutes.\nHere's how to make hot dogs in the air fryer all summer.\n8. Baked potatoes\nOK, so technically this one starts out in the microwave and then gets finished in the air fryer. The microwave softens the inside in less than 8 minutes while the air fryer blasts the edges and skin to a crispy perfection. It's a restaurant-quality baked potato in less than 12 minutes. Here's how to make the best air fryer baked potato ever.\nAnd if you're still not sure what an air fryer is and how it works, check out our complete guide to air fryers.\n9. Grilled cheese\nFor a grilled cheese, the air fryer is working on both of the bread surfaces and the cheese all at once, resulting in a quicker melt, which adheres the cheese to the bread slices together making for a much easier flip. (Flipping is still recommended but with far less drama.)\nHere's the secret to perfect air fryer grilled cheese."
