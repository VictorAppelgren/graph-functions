  "description": "U.S. coffee prices jumped to $8.41 per pound in July, the sharpest rise in years.",
  "content": "Coffee futures, the global benchmark for arabica coffee, have risen more than 33% since July and nearly hit a four-month high in late August as traders have become concerned about the prospect of a slump in coffee supplies coming out of major markets like Brazil and Vietnam amid volatile weather in these regions. Conab, Brazil\u2019s crop forecasting agency, this week slashed the estimate for its 2025 arabica coffee crop by nearly 5% and warned that U.S. tariffs could drive further price gains. The 50% tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on Brazil took effect last month and put \u201cupward pressure\u201d on coffee prices, according to an August report from the International Coffee Organization. Those factors are likely to mean that consumers will have to pay even more to make coffee at home or buy a cup on the go. Ground coffee prices hit a record high of $8.41 per pound in July, up 33% from a year ago, according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. After eggs, coffee experienced the second-highest inflation rate in any category of the consumer price index in July.\n\nThe J.M. Smucker Co., which owns Folgers and Caf\u00e9 Bustelo, has raised coffee prices twice this year and is likely to do so again this winter as a result of Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to reporting by The Wall Street Journal. Tariffs have become a new ingredient in a coffee market that\u2019s been roiled by weather volatility in recent years. There have been severe droughts in both Brazil and Vietnam, and these two countries are the world\u2019s top two coffee producers, according to Bernstein analysts. But there could be some reasons to be optimistic that coffee prices will start to stabilize. Rains in Brazil could allay some of the concerns about the impact of the drought in the South American country, while the outlook from Vietnam has also improved as the country has forecasted a higher crop output for this year.\n\nPrice pressures \u201cshould be easing off\u201d in the near term, Danilo Gargiulo, a senior research analyst at Bernstein, told CNBC. Improving weather and capital investment to boost productivity signal lower prices ahead, while the impact of tariffs on Brazilian imports may be somewhat limited for consumers who buy coffee from the major chains, he added. Finally, there could be some hope for changes on the horizon in terms of Brazil-U.S. trade negotiations. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, is convening a virtual meeting of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) nations next week to discuss Trump\u2019s trade policy, according to Bloomberg. The Brazilian president has repeatedly called on Trump to negotiate on trade after Trump imposed the second-highest tariffs on the nation in retaliation for its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. But Lula has also authorized a retaliation process against Trump\u2019s tariffs, in an attempt to bring the U.S. president back to the negotiation table.",

      "text": "Caffeine levels aren't the only things spiking for coffee drinkers lately.\nPrices for coffee have soared, fueled largely by volatile weather that's reduced crop harvests among major growers like Brazil and Vietnam, according to analysts.\nGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. hit $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nGlobal coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.\nU.S. prices for all coffee varieties (including roasted and instant coffee) were up 14.5% year-on-year in July \u2014 the second-highest annual inflation rate for any CPI category behind eggs, according to the consumer price index.\nPrice pressures \"should be easing off\" in the near term, said Danilo Gargiulo, a senior research analyst at Bernstein.\nBut 50% tariffs that the Trump administration levied on Brazil threaten to put \"upward pressure\" on coffee prices, according to an August report from the International Coffee Organization.\n'Precipitation whiplash' crimps supply\nLike all commodities, coffee prices are a function of supply and demand.\nWeather volatility is perhaps the \"most critical\" short-term factor underpinning coffee supply and prices, since coffee cultivation and yield are \"highly sensitive to its environment,\" according to a Bernstein report published in March.\nA severe drought during Brazil's last summer season \"devastated\" the harvest, Berstein analysts wrote.\nBrazil is the world's top coffee producer, supplying about 40% of the global volume, they wrote. The U.S., the world's largest coffee importer, sources the bulk of its supply (32%) from the South American nation, it said.\nVietnam, the world's No. 2 supplier, was hit by a drought that caused coffee production to fall by 20% in 2024, according to Bernstein.\nThat was followed by heavy rainstorms that also crimped production, said Mike Hoffmann, professor emeritus at Cornell University and lead author of \"Our Changing Menu: Climate Change and the Foods We Love and Need.\"\nThe dynamic \u2014 \"precipitation whiplash\" \u2014 reduces crop yield, he said.\n\"Your standard season isn't as it should be,\" Hoffmann said. \"Drought stresses the coffee plants, then you get way too much water, and it affects the quality and quantity of the bean, the berries.\"\nFurther, as coffee prices have risen, companies like Starbucks chose to draw down their existing coffee inventories instead of buying expensive beans on the open market, Gargiulo said.\nInventories came down \"significantly below historical levels\" in the last few years, Bernstein analysts wrote. While the market can weather a shortfall relatively well when inventories are high, low levels can lead to sharp price spikes if there's a new demand or supply shock, they wrote.\nHow prices might impact coffee drinkers\nConsumers may also feel higher coffee prices differently depending on whether they shop at the grocery store for coffee to prepare at home or consume it away from home, at restaurants or coffee chains, for example, Gargiulo said.\nCoffee prices in the grocery aisle tend to fluctuate more with the commodity cost, meaning they are generally more volatile, he said. Grocers may be quicker to raise store prices as coffee prices rise, and may offer promotions to consumers when coffee prices fall, he said.\nBut prices for food commodities like coffee generally move in cycles, and improving weather and capital investment to boost productivity signal lower prices are likely ahead, Gargiulo said.\nAdditionally, the Brazil tariff \"impact\" may be somewhat limited for consumers who buy from big coffee chains, Gargiulo said.\nHe estimates Starbucks would have to raise prices by 0.5% or less to recoup the full cost of Brazil tariffs, for example.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nWhy inflation is retirees' 'greatest enemy'\nStudent loan borrowers pausing payments have doubled since 2024\n68 jobs may qualify for Trump's $25,000 'no tax on tips' deduction\nOver the longer term, consumers should brace for higher-than-average prices, analysts said.\nExtreme weather that negatively impacts coffee harvests is expected to be more common, and coffee consumption worldwide continues to increase and bolster demand, they said.\n\"The prices will continue to go up, in my mind,\" Hoffmann said.\n\"Climate change isn't going away,\" he said. \"The severity of droughts, flooding, all of that will get worse. It's not just coffee \u2014 it's the whole food supply.\""
