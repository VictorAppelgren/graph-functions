  "title": "College football is back! Can USC and UCLA bounce back into relevance?",
  "description": "Your morning catch-up: We preview the UCLA and USC football teams as the college season kicks off, the public defender\u2019s office seeks removal of Trump\u2019s top L.A. federal prosecutor, and more big stories.",
  "content": "For college football fans, the tranquility and/or boredom of game-free weekends has officially ended.\n\nYes, the college football season is back today along with all of the game-day traditions: tailgating, plopping on the couch with a 60-inch screen, backyard barbecues and incessant complaining about traffic from residents near the Rose Bowl.\n\nHope is high for the USC and UCLA football programs, members of the Big 10 Conference (it still feels weird saying that!).\n\nOur L.A. Times sports team put together an amazing digital preview package for the upcoming season. The Trojans start first, hosting Missouri State at the Memorial Coliseum at 4:30 p.m. today while the Bruins welcome Utah to the Rose Bowl at 8 p.m.\n\nLet\u2019s sample some of that coverage and wish both teams the best of luck. And as an Alabama alumnus myself, may I add a very loud Roll Tide!\n\nMy colleague and Trojans beat writer Ryan Kartje said the redshirt junior made a concerted effort over the summer to eliminate the back-breaking mistakes he struggled with last season.\n\nSince last season, he dug deeper into head coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s offense and worked on his mechanics with the experts at the 3DQB training academy in Huntington Beach.\n\nBut Maiava\u2019s style has lent itself to high variance.\n\nHe loves to chuck it deep and too often throws it into coverage. That could yield some thrilling results. We\u2019ll have to see if that will benefit USC or not.\n\nBut 4.3% of his passes last season were deemed turnover-worthy by Pro Football Focus. That was third-highest in the Big Ten and too high for USC\u2019s offense to reach its potential.\n\nUCLA\u2019s defense will need big seasons from safety Key Lawrence and edge rusher Devin Aupiu.\n\nMy colleague and UCLA beat writer Ben Bolch said UCLA will look for leadership on defense.\n\nPerhaps the most energetic player on the team, Lawrence, a Mississippi transfer, also boasts plenty of talent, speed and smarts.\n\nBarring a setback from a minor right leg injury he sustained midway through training camp, Lawrence projects to be an opening-day starter.\n\nHe\u2019ll need to anchor a secondary that\u2019s replacing every starter.\n\nAs for Aupiu, UCLA\u2019s pass rush was meh last season, generating 22 sacks to rank tied for No. 78 in the nation.\n\nAs a part-time starter, Aupiu made 4\u00bd tackles for losses, including 1\u00bd sacks \u2014 decent production given his limited playing time and easily the most among returning players. Getting into the backfield more often this season is a must for the redshirt senior.\n\nBolch has more in his article: \u201cTen Bruins who must step up for the football team to thrive in \u201925.\u201d\n\nPrediction time: The Bruins will be bowl-bound while the Trojans will split with their rivals.\n\nBolch is predicting a season full of surprises and a bowl berth for the Bruins. Does he think they\u2019ll beat USC? You\u2019ll have to .\n\nKartje is predicting a fast start for the Trojans, who will run into some bumps and bruises in the Big 10 before rallying with a flourish. Will USC topple UCLA and Notre Dame?\n\nKartje thinks only one victory is in store, but which one? Read his preview to find out .\n\nOur Times sports team also lays out key points to watch and season openers while they chat up .\n\nOf course, you can always find more at each team\u2019s landing page, and .\n\nSee you at a game.\n\u2022 Orange County will fight Trump over sensitive voter information, despite pushback.\n\u2022 What the end of \u2018de minimis\u2019 means for online shoppers.\n\u2022 Newsom, California lawmakers strike deal that would allow Uber, Lyft drivers to unionize.\n\u2022 Supervisor Hilda Solis says she\u2019ll run for Congress if new maps are approved.\n\u2022 Boy, 4, died while in custody of leaders of cult-like group; police reopen investigation.\n\u2022 Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova are expecting their fourth child.\n\u2022 Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce and Swift\u2019s big ol\u2019 engagement ring go to a football game together.\n\u2022 Why did Weird Al Yankovic abandon musical parodies for a decade before his bigger, weirder comeback?\n\u2022 Two stairways are required in L.A. apartments.

The debut season of the flagship series concluded with \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 Navy SEAL commander James Reece (Chris Pratt) discovering his closest ally, Ben Edwards (Taylor Kitsch) was involved in the ambush mission that led to the death of his platoon, as well as his wife and daughter. \u201cThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf\u201d traces Ben\u2019s journey from Navy SEAL to CIA operative. Creator and showrunner David DiGilio stopped by to discuss expanding the Jack Carr book universe and working with Kitsch.\nAlso in this week\u2019s Screen Gab, our streaming recommendations are different types of nostalgia plays: Noah Hawley\u2019s timely television prequel to the \u2018Alien\u2019 film franchise that is set on Earth, and \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d the classic western that first hit TV screens 70 years ago and is finding new life in the streaming era.\nICYMI\nMust-read stories you might have missed\nOlivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch are a match made in heaven \u2014 or, in \u2018The Roses,\u2019 hell: They\u2019ve known each other for years, but having the opportunity to spar in a savage new take on \u2018The War of the Roses\u2019 was too good for the longtime friends to pass up.\nHow Taylor Kitsch became Hollywood\u2019s go-to actor (and veterans\u2019 favorite) for military roles: The star of \u2018The Terminal List: Dark Wolf\u2019 discusses his new prequel series and how, with the help of military veterans, he learned to embody a Navy SEAL.\nTelluride Film Festival returns with an eclectic mix of politics, auteur visions and the Boss: The 52nd edition blends star power and auteurs, with world premieres from Scott Cooper, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and Edward Berger, plus new work from Yorgos Lanthimos and Noah Baumbach.\nInside romance queen Emily Henry\u2019s literary empire and soon-to-be cinematic universe: The author has become the master of the contemporary romance novel, publishing six bestsellers since 2020. Now, five are being adapted into movies and shows.\nTurn on\nRecommendations from the film and TV experts at The Times\n\u201cAlien: Earth\u201d (Hulu, Disney+)\nReimagining a nearly 50-year-old franchise like \u201cAlien\u201d isn\u2019t for the faint of heart (or stomach). The iconic sci-fi horror saga has already spawned a tangled web of sequels, prequels and spin-offs of wildly varying quality. But Noah Hawley \u2014 who turned \u201cFargo\u201d and \u201cLegion\u201d into bold, brainy extensions of their cinematic roots \u2014 brings a jolt of fresh, unnerving life to \u201cAlien: Earth.\u201d The horror is real, the xenomorphs still terrifying (and, yes, there are new critters too). But this isn\u2019t just eight hours of people running from acid-blooded monsters. It\u2019s a sprawling, idea-rich vision of a future ruled by tech oligopolies, where minds are uploaded into synthetic bodies and morality is outsourced to machines \u2014 a world as indebted to Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cBlade Runner\u201d as his original \u201cAlien.\u201d The monsters are back, but the deeper thrill is how Hawley keeps you thinking even as you\u2019re bracing for the next kill. Now midway through its eight\u2011episode run, \u201cAlien: Earth\u201d doesn\u2019t just extend a franchise. It reanimates it with a mind of its own and a brand-new set of fangs. \u2014 Josh Rottenberg\n\u201cGunsmoke\u201d (Peacock, Pluto TV)\nI long for the simple times when my family and I would gather around the television to watch the latest episode of \u201cGunsmoke.\u201d The drama that featured James Arness as no-nonsense Marshal Matt Dillon was a staple in millions of households throughout its 20-year run, which ended in 1975. In the streaming era, \u201cGunsmoke\u201d is now sparking a lot of new heat, and has ranked at least twice among Nielsen\u2019s top 10 list of most-streamed acquired series. Beginning Saturday, MeTV will kick off a month-long 70th anniversary salute to the drama, airing specially-themed weeks such as \u201cBest Characters of Dodge City\u201d and five made-for-TV movies. \u2014 Greg Braxton\nGuest spot\nA weekly chat with actors, writers, directors and more about what they\u2019re working on \u2014 and what they\u2019re watching\nTaylor Kitsch rose to fame with his portrayal of brooding football player Tim Riggins on \u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d but he\u2019s spent a good portion of his career since then stepping into the military mindset \u2014 as my former colleague Michael Ordo\u00f1a astutely unpacked in his profile of the actor. With \u201cThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf,\u201d which further expands Jack Carr\u2019s book universe, Kitsch reprises his role as Navy SEAL-turned-CIA operative Ben Edwards in Prime Video\u2019s prequel to 2022\u2019s Chris Pratt-led series. Premiering its first three episodes earlier this week, the series takes place five years before the events of the first season of \u201cThe Terminal List\u201d and explores Ben\u2019s origin story and his crisis of faith that eventually led to his betrayal of James Reece (Pratt). Showrunner David DiGilio stopped by Screen Gab recently to discuss why Ben is a worthwhile character for a spin-off, the story behind that AC/DC needle drop and more. \u2014 Yvonne Villarreal\nWhat was it about the story of Ben Edwards that resonated with you and made you so passionate about wanting to explore his origin story?\nBen is an ever-evolving character. He was different in the book than he was in our scripts for Season 1 of \u201cThe Terminal List.\u201d Then Taylor arrived and brought a whole new layer of empathy, complexity and danger to the role. Unlike Reece, who represents a light wolf character pulled into a dark place by a conspiracy, Ben Edwards is a man with innate darkness inside him. But he also values loyalty, brotherhood and freedom. And that dichotomy in a character means we can give Taylor a ton of great stuff to play. It makes Ben unpredictable. And we get to watch how Ben evolves from a leader in the SEAL Teams to a Black Side Operator who thinks he can use his dark wolf for good.\nYou had involvement from real veterans in the making of the series, including in the writing of the season. There are seven episodes and five were written by veterans. Walk me through finding the voices to join the room and how did that enrich discussion as you broke stories?\nAs we were making Season 1 of the flagship series, we made a commitment to military authenticity. The lived experience is what defines Jack Carr\u2019s writing in the books, and we wanted to make sure it translated to the shows. During Season 1 of \u201cThe Terminal List,\u201d two military veteran storytellers in particular \u2014 Max Adams, a former Army Ranger, and Jared Shaw, a former Navy SEAL \u2014 really stepped up our action and authenticity and our storytelling overall. When it came time for \u201cDark Wolf,\u201d we elevated Max and Jared to executive producer[s]. And we were able to include Jack Carr in more of the writing and creating side of the show as well. But we didn\u2019t stop there. We brought writer-producer Kenny Sheard \u2014 also a former SEAL \u2014 into the writers room and brought back Ray Mendoza \u2014 a former SEAL and technical advisor on Season 1 \u2014 to second unit direct. So, between Max, Jared, Kenny, Ray and Jack Carr himself, I don\u2019t think you have a show that\u2019s more committed to getting it right for the military veteran audience.\nIs there a personal connection \u2014 for you or the veterans who worked on the show \u2014 behind the use of AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHells Bells\u201d to score the time jump in the first episode?\nInteresting story. We were trying to use Led Zeppelin for that training montage in the pilot. The band is notoriously tricky to clear, but we made it to about the five yard line before it got denied. Sadly, we\u2019d been temp-editing with that song for months and were all quite attached. So we now had to pivot \u2026 quickly. We found AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHells Bells\u201d by asking our military veteran storytellers for bands/songs that were big for them during deployments. AC/DC was near the top of the list, and the civilian side of our EP team had connections to the music as well. We tried three AC/DC songs for the sequence, and \u201cHells Bells\u201d was a no-brainer. But, truly, a classic example of the adage \u201cdon\u2019t fall in love with the temp.\u201d We made this music selection way tougher than it needed to be!\nTell us a good story about Taylor Kitsch and his time on the inflatable boat.\nI think the biggest thing we learned from putting Taylor on that boat in the pilot is that we weren\u2019t in Kansas anymore. Meaning, Budapest production is very different than production in the U.S. In the States, you would have a full \u201cmarine unit\u201d dedicated to getting a scene like that. Half a dozen camera boats and follow boats built specifically to capture that sequence. In Budapest, we were tying camera men down on the boat itself, and turning tourist river boats into parts of our armada. Boats could not keep up with those beastly gunship engines. Smaller boats got waked. We got the scene, and we got it safely. But after the ease of filming the flagship series in Los Angeles, I think that day told all of us that Budapest would be a city with unique production challenges. But I give a huge hat tip to the Budapest crew, because even on a day like that, they never complained. And I think having the cast and American crew together in a foreign city really helped bond us all into one big family.\nWhat have you watched recently that you are recommending to everyone you know?\nMy last watch was probably while flying to and from South Africa and Toronto for the filming of \u201cThe Terminal List\u201d Season 2. I downloaded and binged \u201cAdolescence\u201d [Netflix] and Season 2 of \u201cAndor\u201d [Disney+]. I\u2019m surprised more folks don\u2019t talk about \u201cAndor.\u201d It\u2019s probably the most smartly-written show on streaming these days. A World War II resistance film wrapped up in incredible sci-fi visuals. And on \u201cAdolescence,\u201d the performances were incredible. But note to all, whatever you do, don\u2019t watch that show\u2019s finale in a crowded airport lounge in London. I was bawling.\nWhat\u2019s your go-to \u201ccomfort watch,\u201d the movie or TV show you go back to again and again?\nMight not surprise folks to hear, but it\u2019s either \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d [Prime Video, Pluto TV] or \u201cGladiator\u201d [Prime Video, Paramount +]. Both movies capture the warrior\u2019s ethos and sense of brotherhood that we strive for in the \u201cTerminal List\u201d shows. They also combine great action with big emotional character-driven scenes. Hollywood\u2019s balance of VFX and character work was probably at its zenith right around the turn of the century. So I love to rewatch those films as a reminder of the balance I strive for in my writing, and for the balance we try to build into the Jack Carr Universe shows."

      "text": "- Share via\nToward the end of her 2024 campaign, Kamala Harris made a big mistake. Having gained traction by talking about \u201cjoy\u201d and \u201cfreedom,\u201d she panicked and reverted back to apocalyptic warnings about Trump.\nToday, those warnings read like a prophecy. But \u2014 and this part is key \u2014 she still lost.\nThe lesson? Shouting \u201cdemocracy is on the ballot\u201d isn\u2019t a cheat code for winning elections.\nIf the artificial intelligence boom happens while President Trump is in office, he\u2019ll be blamed for the loss of millions of middle-class jobs. But will Democrats offer a vision for a new workforce?\nIn fact, in 2024, many voters who claimed democracy was their top issue pulled the lever for \u2026 Donald Trump (which is sort of like saying your top priority is dental hygiene, and then brushing your teeth with a Hershey\u2019s bar).\nThis, of course, brings us to current events. Trump is working overtime to prove Harris was right. He has federalized and militarized the Washington police, deployed the National Guard and threatened similar action in Chicago and Baltimore.\nTrump\u2019s FBI searched John Bolton\u2019s house, and he floated reopening the \u201cBridgegate\u201d \u2014 because nothing screams strength like digging up a 10-year-old scandal to punish Chris Christie for being mean.\nIf they hear one more lecture about toxic masculinity, they\u2019re likely to vote for the most toxic guy in the room.\nHe also signed an executive order against flag burning \u2014 complete with talk of a one-year mandatory jail sentence. Because, you know, free speech.\nTrump cut a deal giving the U.S. government a 10% stake in the chipmaker Intel. Because socialism is now apparently good.\nAnd ICE? They detained Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Again. Last time, he was deported to El Salvador. This time, they\u2019re trying to ship him to Uganda. Next time? Maybe outer space.\nMeanwhile, Trump fired Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, a move that seems aimed at pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates.\nAnd just in case the \u201cNorth Korean dictator\u201d optics weren\u2019t already obvious, the Labor Department unfurled a huge banner featuring Trump\u2019s head.\nIt\u2019s frustrating to watch the systematic and never-ending erosion of American norms and institutions while most Americans collectively yawn. But the truth is that most voters don\u2019t clutch their pearls over this kind of stuff.\nTo Joe Sixpack, deploying the National Guard sounds like fighting crime. And having your home searched by the FBI feels like the kind of thing you only have to worry about if you\u2019re an elite \u2014 and probably deserve it. (Hell, half the electorate probably thinks John Bolton is that guy who sang \u201cHow Am I Supposed to Live Without You.\u201d)\nTo everyday people, this all feels abstract, and abstract doesn\u2019t resonate with most voters. Indeed, it turns them off.\nThat\u2019s the paradox. Lean too heavily into liberal democracy, and Democrats sound like out-of-touch hall monitors. Ignore Trump\u2019s power grabs, and they look complicit or spineless to their base. Either way, they lose.\nSo what\u2019s left? The same thing that\u2019s always mattered the most to the most voters: the economy.\nIn 2024, Trump turned inflation into a cudgel. Americans obsessively worried about the cost of eggs. Not the Constitution. Not norms. Not Trump\u2019s promise of retribution or talk of being a dictator for \u201cDay One.\u201d Eggs!\nAnd boy did it work. After the election, a whopping 32% of voters said the economy was the most important issue that influenced their vote.\nNow, the script has flipped. Trump promised lower grocery prices \u201con Day One.\u201d Instead, prices are up again \u2014 and his tariffs and immigration policies will only push them higher. (Ditto forcing the Fed to lower interest rates, a move that is likely to spur inflation on all sorts of consumer items.)\nThat\u2019s the opening Democrats have needed.\nDon\u2019t just take my word for it. While Trump was busy running amok, Democrat Catelin Drey won a huge double-digit special election victory for an Iowa state Senate seat previously held by a Republican.\nAnd what was Drey\u2019s election about? \u201cThe main frustration point that I am hearing is that we have an affordability crisis,\u201d she told the Des Moines Register. \u201cAnd folks are really feeling that in their pocketbooks and in their spending decisions.\u201d\nThe big lesson we can take from Drey\u2019s victory and Harris\u2019 defeat isn\u2019t that \u201cdemocracy doesn\u2019t matter\u201d; it\u2019s that you can\u2019t lead with a civics lecture. Lead with groceries and rent and child care.\nSo don\u2019t just say Trump is eroding democracy, say he\u2019s eroding your savings. Don\u2019t just say he\u2019s breaking norms, say he\u2019s breaking the bank. Don\u2019t just talk about Trump\u2019s empty promises, talk about empty shelves, empty wallets, empty refrigerators.\nBecause here\u2019s the dark truth about the current state of America: You won\u2019t save democracy by talking about democracy or by calling Trump an authoritarian. The only way to save democracy is to prove it\u2019s better \u2014 and cheaper! \u2014 than the alternative.\nMatt K.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nWarnings about democracy being \u201con the ballot\u201d failed as an electoral strategy, as evidenced by Kamala Harris\u2019s loss despite accurately predicting Trump\u2019s authoritarian actions. Many voters who claimed democracy was their top concern still voted for Trump, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of this messaging approach.\nTrump\u2019s current actions, including federalizing Washington police, deploying the National Guard, and various other power grabs, validate concerns about democratic erosion but don\u2019t resonate with ordinary voters who view these issues as abstract and disconnected from their daily lives.\nMost Americans don\u2019t respond to constitutional concerns because they seem elitist and theoretical, while actions like FBI searches feel like problems that only affect political elites who probably deserve scrutiny anyway.\nEconomic issues, particularly grocery prices and inflation, remain the primary driver of voter behavior, as demonstrated by 32% of voters citing the economy as their most important issue in 2024 and recent Democratic victories focused on affordability rather than democracy.\nDemocrats face a strategic paradox where focusing too heavily on liberal democracy makes them appear out-of-touch, while ignoring Trump\u2019s authoritarian actions makes them seem complicit, creating a lose-lose scenario for traditional democratic messaging.\nThe most effective approach for protecting democracy involves proving that democratic governance delivers better economic outcomes, essentially saving democracy through economic success rather than constitutional arguments.\nDifferent views on the topic\nDemocracy scholars largely agree that American democracy faces substantial threats, with the likelihood of dramatic and lasting changes to the political system being significant enough to warrant serious attention even if the probability remains below 50%[1]. Furthermore, a majority of Americans recognize the severity of the situation, with 57% believing the country is experiencing a constitutional crisis that represents a breakdown of normal constitutional order[2].\nTrump\u2019s recent actions demonstrate concrete threats to democratic institutions that extend beyond abstract concerns, including systematic attempts to circumvent Congress, refusal to comply with court orders, and concerning statements that the judicial system cannot check executive power[2]. These actions represent what scholars identify as preconditions for regime change, even under narrow definitions of democracy focused solely on free and fair elections[1].\nThe Trump administration\u2019s takeover of Washington law enforcement represents unprecedented federal overreach that raises serious constitutional questions, including potential violations of the Posse Comitatus Act and improper use of emergency powers[4]. Legal experts argue that the administration\u2019s interpretation of statutory authority exceeds what the law actually permits, particularly regarding federal control over local police departments.\nPolitical scientists and observers note that Trump\u2019s actions since January 2025 strongly resemble the \u201cautocratic playbook\u201d used by leaders in countries where democracy has been significantly eroded, drawing comparisons to democratic backsliding in Hungary, India, Poland, and other nations[3]. Some experts contend that the United States has already slipped into the category of competitive authoritarian regimes, arguing that checks and balances are actively failing[3].\nCounter-mobilization against democratic erosion may prove effective, as aggressive multi-front approaches like Trump\u2019s current strategy can provoke significant resistance even from sympathetic observers within the Republican Party who may be forced to acknowledge threats to democracy[1]. Additionally, the speed and visibility of democratic backsliding in America may actually help defenders of democracy recognize dangers and act before it becomes too late[1]."

      "text": "What the end of \u2018de minimis\u2019 means for online shoppers\n- Share via\nFor nearly nine decades, an import tax exception allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. without duties attached. The rule has let American consumers access loads of cheap foreign goods from online retailers.\nThat\u2019s all changing Friday when the rule known as de minimis is suspended in accordance with an executive order President Trump signed last month. All shipments into the U.S. will be subject to an import tax ranging from $80 to $200 for the next six months, after which the rate will be based on the tariffs imposed on the country of origin.\nSince 2015, the de minimis exception has applied to goods with a retail value of less than $800. The rule dates to 1938, when it applied only to goods worth less than $1.\nMultiple postal services around Europe say they are suspending the shipment of many packages to the United States amid a lack of clarity over new import duties.\nOnline retail giants such as Temu and Shein, which ship products from China with hyper-low price tags, have \u201cbenefited massively\u201d from the exception, said Dominick Miserandino, chief executive of the online hub Retail Tech Media Nexus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to this super cheap pricing mentality for a lot of online goods, and with the removal of this rule, it\u2019s going away,\u201d Miserandino said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to hit consumers who are accustomed to buying a $5 phone case.\u201d\nThe rise and fall of \u2018de minimis\u2019\nCongress first introduced the exception in 1938 to boost trade and spare the government the hassle of processing low-value parcels generating negligible tax revenue. De minimis is Latin for something of little importance.\nLawmakers increased the threshold from $1 to $5 in 1990 and again to $200 in 1993. Under the most recent threshold of $800, the number of packages entering the U.S. duty-free has skyrocketed.\nMore than 1.30 billion packages with a combined value of $64.6 billion reached the U.S. with no import tax in 2024, compared to 134 million packages in 2015, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nTrump has called the rule a \u201cscam\u201d that weakens American businesses and allows dangerous goods to enter the country without oversight. Packages that claim the exemption are not inspected as thoroughly by U.S. Customs personnel.\nTrump ended the so-called loophole for goods sent from China in May before eliminating the practice for goods from all other foreign nations. Documents and gifts under $100 are still exempt from import taxes.\nTrump closed the \u2018de minimis\u2019 shipping loophole, calling the exemption a \u2018big scam\u2019 that has hurt U.S. business and enabled the fentanyl trade.\nWhat can U.S. consumers expect?\nThe price increase Americans could see on everyday goods such as pet products and apparel depends on where the package is coming from and what portion of the import duty the shopper is responsible for.\nLarge manufacturers may choose to cover the duty themselves, while smaller sellers like those on the online shopping platform Etsy could pass costs onto customers.\nTrump placed some of his highest tariffs of 30% and 35% on China and Canada, respectively, though the rate on Chinese goods remains under negotiation. Switzerland faces a tariff of 39%. The price of goods shipped from these countries will likely rise in proportion with the tariffs, leading to significant jumps in sticker prices.\nIt will also be more difficult to get foreign goods delivered, at least for the moment. Several international postage services are suspending deliveries to the U.S. in response to Trump\u2019s executive order. Japan, Switzerland, France and Australia are among more than a dozen nations that have paused U.S. shipments while they adjust to the new pricing requirements."

The bros (Jason was there too) were rooting for the Bearcats, obviously, with Travis rocking a street-art emblazoned Cincinnati cap and his older sibling sported a more traditional college typeface on his chapeau.\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce are taking their love story to the next chapter. The couple announced their engagement Tuesday after two years of dating.\nSwift rocked a denim miniskirt, according to People, with a white sweater, white boots, green nails and, oh yes, that massive engagement ring. The Old Mine Cut diamond ring was designed by Travis Kelce and New York City-based jewelry designer Kindred Lubeck, according to myriad media reports.\n- Share via\nWhile experts who talked to People put the size of the stone at between 5 and 10 carats and guesstimated its value as anywhere from $125,000 to $5 million \u2014 which is quite the range \u2014 folks who talked to Page Six said it likely came with a $1-million price tag. Basically, nobody knows the value of a custom-made, vintage-style ring with a one-of-a-kind hand-etched diamond that is currently sitting on the ring finger of a global pop star. Go figure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my engraved pieces that put me on the digital map,\u201d Lubeck told VoyageJacksonville in 2024. \u201cI started making reels showcasing my work and people started noticing.

(Swifties, where you at? A bunch of them can be had for less than $5,000! And they\u2019re not even \u201cdistressed.\u201d)\nThe Grammy-winning \u201cLove Story\u201d pop icon and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end announced the beginning of their engagement era on Tuesday in a joint Instagram post.\n\u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,\u201d Swift captioned photos from the garden engagement, which actually took place a couple of weeks earlier.\nTravis Kelce\u2019s old tweets resurfaced amid his high-profile romance with singer Taylor Swift and he\u2019s praising her in a new interview: \u2018I\u2019m learning every day.\u2019\nKelce\u2019s dad told a Cleveland news station the same day that Travis had popped the question at home in Lee\u2019s Summit, Mo., after months of planning, right before the two headed out for dinner. Before they left, Travis told Taylor, \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s go out and have a glass of wine.\u2019 ... They got out there, and that\u2019s when he asked her, and it was beautiful,\u201d Ed Kelce said.\nHe added with a happy shrug, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much I\u2019m supposed to say, but I don\u2019t care!\u201d\nBut Vice President JD Vance definitely cares \u2014 about the effects this pairing might have on the NFL this season.\n\u201cI will say as a football fan \u2014 as a Cincinnati Bengals fan \u2014 I hope that the NFL does not put a thumb on the scale for the Kansas City Chiefs just because Travis Kelce is now getting married to maybe the most famous woman in the world,\u201d the veep told USA Today this week.\n\u201cYou guys can\u2019t sort of have this, \u2018I\u2019m worried they\u2019re going to have a Super Bowl wedding\u2019 thing this season.

      "text": "Times of Troy: Game-by-game picks for the USC football team this season\n- Share via\nAfter all the transfer portal trackers and the Lincoln Riley Finebaum rants and the landscape-altering, paradigm-shifting changes to the sport, it\u2019s finally game week here at the Times of Troy.\nWe\u2019re at the doorstep of a new USC football season, which means there\u2019s no better time to subscribe to this newsletter and ensure you get the best USC analysis \u2014 not to mention TV recs, Big Ten betting picks, Midwest travel tips and more \u2014 delivered to your inbox every Monday morning.\nFor this week, it\u2019s time for the Times of Troy to get down to business. We\u2019ve told you what the best-case scenario would look like for Lincoln Riley and the Trojans this season. We\u2019ve told you the worst case. So now, let\u2019s talk about how we actually think this season will unfold at USC.\nAug. 30 vs. Missouri State: USC was supposed to welcome Lane Kiffin back to the Coliseum in this one. Instead, they get a team playing in its first game as a Football Bowl Subdivision team. Missouri State had just six winning seasons in this century at the FCS level. Its record over the last five years (26-31) is the worst of any team making the FBS transition ever. The Bears have a quarterback with some potential in Jacob Clark, but that won\u2019t be nearly enough.\nPrediction: USC wins, 52-10\nSept. 6 vs. Georgia Southern: Clay Helton\u2019s return to the Coliseum could be an uncomfortable affair, if only because Georgia Southern might actually be one of the best teams in the Sun Belt Conference. At the very least, they return a lot of experience on both sides of the ball. That shouldn\u2019t trip up a team with the talent of USC. But don\u2019t be surprised if the Trojans come out tight. A big mistake from USC makes things interesting before the defense clamps down in the second half.\nPrediction: USC wins, 33-20\nSept. 13 at Purdue: It\u2019s tough to know what to expect from a team that brought in 54 (!!) transfers, but I\u2019ve seen enough of Purdue in recent years to not expect all that much. Barry Odom worked magic at Nevada Las Vegas, but it won\u2019t be nearly that simple in West Lafayette, with a Big Ten schedule ahead. For USC, this is as smooth of a Big Ten road opener as they could hope for. It should be noted the Trojans did lose a game like this \u2014 to Maryland \u2014 a year ago. This time, USC takes the opportunity to prove it can push down the gas pedal late.\nPrediction: USC wins, 38-13\nSept. 20 vs. Michigan State: Entering this game at 3-0 is essential because the road gets much rockier from here. If quarterback Aidan Chiles can make the leap in his second year with Jonathan Smith, the Spartans could make this interesting. But this is still a Spartan offense that ranked 123rd of 134 teams in points per game last season. They won\u2019t be that bad in 2025, but this early in the season, I don\u2019t see the Spartans keeping up. Especially with USC\u2019s defense eager to make a statement.\nPrediction: USC wins, 30-17\nSept. 27 at Illinois: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say the direction of USC\u2019s entire season could be determined in Champaign, Ill., in late September. A win could catapult the Trojans into playoff contention. A loss could start a monthlong slide. They\u2019re not the only ones with a lot on the line here, though. Illinois has its own playoff ambitions. Plus, the Illini return 18 starters, including quarterback Luke Altmyer, who\u2019s already one of the best in the conference. I toiled over picking this game, but ultimately couldn\u2019t get USC\u2019s struggles on the road last season out of my head.\nPrediction: USC loses, 24-23\nOct. 11 vs. Michigan: We know that Michigan will have a top-tier defense, but on offense, so much rides on a relative unknown, albeit one with a rocket right arm. True freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood looks the part of a Vince Young clone, but will he be able to handle a hostile atmosphere and keep his composure? Michigan will have already faced Oklahoma (at home) and Nebraska (in Lincoln) by this point, so this isn\u2019t Underwood\u2019s first rodeo on the road. The Coliseum will be rocking, and USC will be eager to avenge last season\u2019s loss. But the Trojans offensive line will struggle to stay intact. And in a grind-it-out kind of game, I favor Michigan and its defensive front.\nPrediction: USC loses, 28-24\nOct. 18 at Notre Dame: After back-to-back difficult defeats, USC travels to South Bend for arguably the toughest game of its season. We don\u2019t know yet what to expect out of C.J. Carr and the Notre Dame passing attack, but that\u2019s pretty much where the questions stop. The Irish have the best run game USC will face all season, led by Heisman candidate Jeremiyah Love, and probably the best overall defense, too. Unless Jayden Maiava has a star turn or USC\u2019s defense creates turnovers, it could be a long trip for the Trojans.\nPrediction: USC loses, 27-17\nNov. 1 at Nebraska: The bye comes at a critical time here for USC, having lost three in a row. In this scenario, we might be talking about whether or not Riley should continue with Maiava at quarterback. But traveling to Lincoln is no walk in the park. The Huskers have one of the more hostile environments in the Big Ten and could be primed for a leap this season. That said, I do think USC will exorcise its road demons somewhere on this schedule. The calls for five-star freshman Husan Longstreet might have gotten pretty loud by this point, but Maiava comes up big while the Trojans\u2019 backs are against the wall.\nPrediction: USC wins, 34-31\nNov. 7 vs. Northwestern: The short week after an emotional win leaves USC primed for a letdown, and the Wildcats should be improved with a passable quarterback in Southern Methodist transfer Preston Stone now under center. But the gap between these two teams is just too significant for Northwestern to bridge on the road. USC\u2019s defense dominates, and Maiava continues to roll.\nPrediction: USC wins, 41-16\nNov. 15 vs. Iowa: I think Iowa will surprise people this season, now that it finally has a quarterback in Mark Gronowski capable of slinging it. Kirk Ferentz will always have the Hawkeyes playing good defense, and they could make life difficult on Maiava and USC\u2019s passing attack if the Trojans get behind. It\u2019s just the sort of game where Riley\u2019s coaching and in-game management will play a critical role. So, too, will D\u2019Anton Lynn\u2019s defensive prowess. I think his group comes up big in this one, giving Lynn another showcase for NFL teams looking for their next coordinator.\nPrediction: USC wins, 24-17\nNov. 22 at Oregon: After so much roster turnover and with a new quarterback at the helm, Oregon is a big question mark to me. Between the two of USC\u2019s toughest road tilts \u2014 Notre Dame being the other \u2014 this game feels more winnable to me. That said, I have a tough time envisioning USC heading into Autzen in late November. We just haven\u2019t seen Riley\u2019s teams win games like this yet. New Oregon running back Makhi Hughes will continue his surge as one of the Big Ten\u2019s best backs, and the Ducks defensive front, led by Matayo Uiagalelei, will give USC\u2019s offensive line fits.\nPrediction: USC loses, 38-31\nNov. 29 vs. UCLA: Count me as someone who doesn\u2019t buy the sudden hype for a Bruins offense led by Nico Iamaleava. For one, the weapons around Iamaleava aren\u2019t nearly of the caliber as they were last season at Tennessee. UCLA\u2019s defense was able to keep Maiava in check last season, but that was a full year ago. USC has a big day with its downfield offense, and the Trojans take the crosstown rivalry for the third time in four years.\nPrediction: USC wins, 42-24\nOfficial Times of Troy record prediction: 8-4\nIt\u2019s only right, I guess, that after suggesting USC could go anywhere from 6-6 to 10-2, I end up settling right in the middle. USC\u2019s defense is going to take a step forward this season \u2014 I feel confident about that much. But there are still too many questions on offense, namely along the offensive line, for me to trust the Trojans to beat teams like Illinois, Nebraska, Notre Dame or Oregon on the road. It\u2019s up to Maiava to make me eat my words.\nExtra points\n\u2014With DJ Wingfield not suiting up this fall, the starting offensive line that makes the most sense to me \u2026 has Tobias Raymond at left guard, and Justin Tauanuu at right tackle. Riley has harped for years about having his best five linemen, regardless of position, playing up front. Tauanuu has more pedigree and experience, both in practice and in games, than Micah Banuelos. Plus, when Redmond was being recruited, USC told him they saw him as a future NFL interior lineman. The bigger question may be at center, where Kilian O\u2019Connor has kept even with transfer J\u2019Onre Reed all camp.\n\u2014Count receivers Tanook Hines and Corey Simms as freshmen who could contribute. Ja\u2019Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon will get the lion\u2019s share of targets this season, but beyond them, the receiver room is wide open. Prince Strachan will presumably start the season on the outside opposite of Lane, while Zacharyus Williams and Jay Fair will factor in on a rotational basis. But before season\u2019s end, don\u2019t be surprised if either of these two works their way into a role.\n\u2014USC will once again pick its captains weekly. Most fans I\u2019ve talked to didn\u2019t love this setup last season, but Riley thinks it gives players an incentive to prove themselves every week. I think the real answer is probably that it doesn\u2019t impact much at all. Players know who the team leaders are, whether they\u2019re announced as captains or not.\n\u2014The SEC is finally adopting a nine-game league schedule. Which the Big Ten has been pushing for, publicly and privately. But while the Big Ten got what it wants in this case \u2014 and what\u2019s best for college football, I might add \u2014 the SEC wouldn\u2019t make this move for equity\u2019s sake. My guess is that this compromise eventually leads the Big Ten to accept the SEC\u2019s preferred model for the College Football Playoff. The Big Ten has held out to this point on a system with four automatic qualifiers for themselves and the SEC, the rest of the power conferences, including the SEC, want a format with five conference champions and 11 at-large bids.\n\u2014Auburn has decided to claim the 2004 national title for itself. L-O-L. The record books may say that USC vacated the 2004 national title. But let\u2019s set aside that technicality for a moment to marvel at the audacity of claiming a championship more than two decades after the fact. And not just that, but claiming a championship that rightfully belongs to one of the greatest college football teams of the 21st century. That Trojans team set out to \u201cleave no doubt\u201d during that season after sharing the title in 2003, and they proceeded to go wire to wire at No. 1 in the AP poll, beating their opponents by an average net margin of 25 points per game. No one doubted who was the champion then, and no one doubts it now. No matter what the NCAA or Auburn happens to claim.\nIn case you missed it\nQ&A: Former USC star Todd Marinovich says it was cathartic to finally write his own story\nCarson Palmer embracing the challenges and joys of coaching high school football\nTop USC receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane cleared to play after breaking his foot during offseason\nJudge\u2019s ruling effectively blocks two players from competing for USC and UCLA this season\nWhat I\u2019m watching this week\nSeth Rogen has been on an absolute heater lately \u2014 \u201cThe Studio\u201d is probably my favorite show of 2025 to date \u2014 and his role in \u201cPlatonic\u201d is just another feather in his cap. I could watch Rogen and Rose Byrne banter for hours on end, which is pretty much the premise of this Apple comedy about two platonic forty-something friends grappling with their lives. What we\u2019ve seen of the second season so far is letting other members of the cast cook, too, which is always a great sign for where a comedy is headed.\nUntil next time ...\nThat concludes today\u2019s newsletter.

      "text": "- Share via\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 They came from all across America to join President Trump\u2019s deportation machine.\nA Border Patrol agent, his firefighter wife and their 3-year-old daughter who drove nearly eight hours for jobs that could bring them closer to home. A man from Tennessee who wanted to apply because of \u201cthe way things have become with the illegal immigration and the strain it\u2019s been on our economy.\u201d\nAnd a young Latino who was already catching flak for trying to work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A friend texted: \u201cOh hell no Ricardo I thought you was joking. I will not speak to you ever again if you become and ice agent ... You have a dad who was deported dude.\u201d\nThey showed up Tuesday in Arlington, Texas, drawn by the Department of Homeland Security, which has mounted a campaign reminiscent of a wartime recruitment drive. Its images of Uncle Sam \u2014 wearing a baseball cap with the letters ICE or with an eagle behind him \u2014 tell people \u201cAMERICA NEEDS YOU.\u201d\n\u201cAmerica has been invaded by criminals and predators,\u201d the recruitment posts on social media read. \u201cWe need YOU to get them out.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s two-day career expo marked the first major hiring event staged by ICE since the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which earmarked about $170 billion for border and immigration enforcement, including tens of billions of dollars for hiring deportation agents and other personnel. ICE officials say it\u2019s the first of several hiring events planned around the country.\n- Share via\nDHS officials say that in less than two weeks, the agency received more than 100,000 applications, although it\u2019s unclear how many were viable candidates. The department has loosened age restrictions for potential recruits and is offering hiring incentives such as bonuses of up to $50,000 and student loan repayment benefits. ICE hopes to hire 10,000 deportation officers by the end of the year, although some worry that the expedited expansion could open the door to troubling hires.\nWhether the agency will reach its goal remains to be seen, but a couple of days in Texas shows there\u2019s no shortage of applicants eager to join an agency that has become essential in Trump\u2019s push to drive out immigrants who are in the country illegally.\nIn all, 3,000 people attended the expo, and nearly 700 received tentative job offers, according to ICE.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to get people to come here ... this is a highly desired career,\u201d Matthew Elliston, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations assistant director, told reporters at the expo. \u201cEspecially amongst those who are currently in law enforcement. A lot of people want to do this job.\u201d\nPresident Trump says he wants to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 3,000 Border Patrol agents. The Department of Homeland Security says it\u2019s already making progress on new hires, but experts and the history of past hiring sprees suggest reaching that goal will be difficult.\nThe wide interest in ICE employment suggests that, while some apply for these federal jobs despite months of uproar over immigration raids, others are drawn to them because Trump\u2019s deportation efforts have great appeal.\n\u201cAs American citizens, I think we need to step up and try to help instead of depending on someone else to do it,\u201d said one man, who drove 10 hours from Tennessee and declined to give his name. \u201cI think decent people will do that.\u201d\nAnother man, wearing a shirt with the American flag on it, said he was there because of \u201cpatriotism.\u201d\nAnd then there are those who view working as a deportation officer as a means to an end \u2014 whether that\u2019s paying off a newly purchased home or gaining financial security.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a career, not a job,\u201d said 25-year-old T.J. Jordan, who wore a cross around his neck and miniature ones dangling from his ears. \u201cWhether that be law enforcement, immigration enforcement.\u201d\nThe expo was held inside the Esports Stadium in Arlington \u2014 branded the \u201cAmerican Dream City\u201d \u2014 halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth.\nInside, screens featured rallying messages to join the team \u201cAND UNLOCK YOUR POTENTIAL.\u201d \u201cWith honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland and our values.\u201d Outside, a group of protesters shouted at applicants: \u201cYou\u2019re a Nazi now. You want to deport grandma.\u201d\nEven before the 8 a.m. start time on the expo\u2019s first day, a line of about 100 people snaked around the building. ICE officials said about 1,800 applicants had registered to attend. They hoped to come away with 1,000 new hires.\nApplicants wore suits, dresses, jeans, cowboy hats and boots, longhorn belt buckles. Some doused themselves in body spray in the parking lot before joining the line. They held binders and manila folders that contained resumes and diplomas.\nThere were men, women and toddlers whose parents had not been able to secure child care. Mixed in the crowd were young applicants with peach fuzz and older men and women, hair streaked with gray.\nAlthough Orlin Chotev is 61, he said he felt he had a chance after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that ICE would waive age limits for new applicants, allowing applicants as young as 18 and eliminating a maximum age.\nChotev, a Texas resident, immigrated from Bulgaria in 2010, drawn to America \u201cbecause it\u2019s a country of legal order.\u201d He said he waited 15 years to get a green card and another five or so to become a U.S. citizen.\n\u201cI know when law is not enforced what chaos and corruption results,\u201d said Chotev, as protesters shouted into megaphones nearby. \u201cNow maybe it\u2019s my call to help this country enforce its laws.\u201d\nChotev, who worked as a systems engineer in IT for more than a decade, said ICE officials asked him whether he was a citizen and inquired about his skills. He was also asked his age, noting, \u201cI\u2019m sure it will affect my chances. It does in every job.\u201d\nRegardless, he said, his hope is \u201cto get a good job where I can contribute.\u201d\nIt is a dramatic time to join ICE, the agency that \u2014 despite the key role of Border Patrol agents \u2014 has become almost shorthand for the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive campaign to remove undocumented immigrants from the country.\nThe administration has vowed to deport the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d But in recent months, videos of immigration raids \u2014 especially in Los Angeles \u2014 have gone viral, capturing agents arresting tamale vendors, day laborers and car wash workers. Noem said this week that Border Patrol and ICE have made 5,000 arrests in the L.A. area since June.\nBut the statistics in California have not reflected arrests focused primarily on those with criminal records.\nFrom July 1 to July 29, ICE data show that officers arrested 2,782 people in California. About 67% of those had no criminal convictions and 54% had never been convicted or charged with a crime. Nationally, the data show 22,611 people were arrested in July. Of those, 65% had no criminal convictions and 37% had never been convicted or charged with a crime.\nL.A. in particular has become a battleground against the Trump administration\u2019s deportation efforts, with lawyers, unions and immigrant rights groups filing a federal lawsuit accusing immigration officials of racial profiling.\nBut that discontent has spread across the country \u2014 including in Texas.\nAcross the street from the expo, around 30 protesters stood behind metal barricades chanting \u201cShame\u201d and \u201cGo home Nazis\u201d at applicants passing by. They held American flags and signs that read \u201cThe Constitution Matters\u201d and \u201cDefend Democracy.\u201d\n\u201cAre you gonna put the mask on before you kiss your kids goodbye for school tomorrow?\u201d shouted Teresa Dunham, a 65-year-old Arlington resident and the first protester to arrive at about 7:30 a.m.\nDunham said she wasn\u2019t surprised at the large turnout of applicants.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting for this their whole life, this opportunity to just be a badass or whatever they think,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cThey are putting in writing what they\u2019re willing to do to other people to get a paycheck. And some of them, I\u2019m sure, don\u2019t even want a paycheck, they\u2019ve been living for this day.\u201d\nThe small crowd of protesters did not appear to deter applicants or slow the pace of processing inside the stadium.\nAs people lined up so officials could review their identification and resumes, current and former law enforcement personnel were routed into a separate line, with the goal of expediting their path. There was an officer who had flown in from Massachusetts. Others from Louisiana.\nThe expedited hiring process has raised concerns, with some likening it to a Border Patrol hiring spree from 2006 to 2009, in which standards for hiring and training were lowered and about 8,000 agents were brought on. The Associated Press reported that the number of employees arrested for misconduct \u2014 such as civil rights violations or off-duty crimes including domestic violence \u2014 grew yearly between 2007 and 2012, reaching 336, or a 44% increase.\nWhen asked about the Border Patrol hiring spree, Elliston stressed that ICE applicants will not get firm job offers until they\u2019ve cleared a background check.\nIf something is flagged in an applicants background, he said, that person could be asked to take a polygraph exam \u201cto make sure that we are hiring the right person so we don\u2019t have the same problem that you\u2019re speaking about with Border Patrol.\u201d\nHundreds of people waited, sitting on black metal folding chairs or standing in groups, hoping for an email or phone call telling them they\u2019d received a tentative offer. They listened to the same video playing on a loop, telling them that ICE works \u201cto strengthen the integrity of our entire immigration system.\u201d\nOccasionally, a voice would boom out from the public address system, calling applicants by last name: Saldana. Sanchez. Rivera. Chavez.\nAmong the Latinos present that day was Angela Larrosa, a 45-year-old former flight attendant and Dallas resident. Her mother had immigrated from Mexico and her father from Uruguay in the 1960s.\n\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t know what to think, but then the more I started really looking into it, you know you have to really think about, are they really just taking anyone off of the streets and deporting them? No,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking people that have criminal backgrounds, people that are a threat to the community, people that don\u2019t really need to be here,\u201d Larrosa said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking the criminals out and I\u2019m all for that.\u201d\nRicardo Quiroz, 23, and his two friends, Ivan Gonzalez, 27, and Blake Holland, 24, had also shown up looking to join. The Texas residents had been talking for weeks about the expo and their hopes of becoming deportation officers.\nBut Gonzalez said he told ICE hiring officials that he had a 10-year-old felony on his record for petty theft and he was told he wouldn\u2019t qualify for the position. Holland said all he had on his resume were fast-food jobs; he was told he needed more work experience.\nQuiroz said he hoped to add to his resume and get a job with the agency down the line.\n\u201cWe just wanted to take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d Quiroz said. His father had been deported to Mexico when Quiroz was a teenager.\nAsked how his family reacted to his decision to apply to ICE, Quiroz said he doesn\u2019t communicate much with them. But he said his girlfriend\u2019s cousin had gotten upset when he texted her a picture from inside the expo and told her he was applying for a job. He explained he was trying to get a career.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just things can go a long way,\u201d he texted her. \u201cBut I understand your point of view.\u201d\n\u201cWell good for you and if that\u2019s what you want so be it but I don\u2019t condone for ice and will never agree with what ice does to little kids and adults,\u201d she texted back.\nAs the day progressed, tentative job offers began to roll in.\nT.J. Jordan got one. He\u2019d already applied online but came in person in hopes of expediting the process. His grandfather \u2014 formerly in law enforcement \u2014 and other relatives encouraged him to apply.\nJordan held a red folder with his resume inside. He\u2019s a contract worker in the San Antonio area in the solar energy industry. As such, he said, he has to pay for all his own benefits. For ICE employees, \u201cthey\u2019re going to take care of the benefits for you,\u201d he said.\nAround four hours after he arrived, a tentative offer came through. The agency just needed to get his background check and drug test results back first, he said. If he ultimately gets the job and accepts, he will head out for training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers in Brunswick, Ga.\n\u201cThe job security is something people are thinking about,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cPeople who want to start a family and grow up in a safe country \u2014 I think that\u2019s why most people will do it.\u201d\nTimes data reporter Gabrielle LaMarr LeMee contributed to this report."

      "text": "Why did Weird Al Yankovic abandon musical parodies for a decade before his bigger, weirder comeback?\n- Share via\nA decade ago, \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic launched his 12th concert tour, which covered 200 shows over two years. Somewhere along the line, the pop world\u2019s foremost parodist was backstage putting on a fat suit \u201cfor literally the 1,000th time\u201d when he was suddenly struck by the desire to \u201cgo out on stage and do a show like a regular musician.\u201d\nSoon after, he launched his \u201cRidiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour,\u201d playing small venues with no video screens, no costume changes, no props or choreography, and none of the song parodies that made him famous. The songs were still comedic \u2014 \u201cEverything I write winds up a little warped,\u201d he says \u2014 but were original tunes that were pastiches of, say, Frank Zappa or They Might Be Giants\u2019 style. He enjoyed it so much he revived the concept a couple of years ago.\nYankovic, 65, has also not released a parody song for more than a decade, in part, he says, because there\u2019s no longer a \u201cmonoculture where it\u2019s more obvious what the hits are,\u201d but also because he enjoys the challenges of those original pastiches, some of which take months for him to develop.\n\u201cI wanted to prove that I\u2019m more than just the parody guy,\u201d says Yankovic, who also co-wrote the 2022 TV film \u201cWeird: The Al Yankovic Story.\u201d The loopy biopic satire starred Daniel Radcliffe and earned Yankovic an Emmy nomination for his writing. (Recently, he also had self-parodying cameo in \u201cNaked Gun.\u201d)\nNow, having proved he was more than the parody guy, Yankovic has re-embraced the whole full-throated \u201cWeird Al\u201d parody thing \u2014 his \u201cBigger & Weirder\u201d tour, which comes to the Kia Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, features plenty of video screens, lots of costume changes and props, and twice as many band members.\nAnd, of course, it features parodies covering decades of pop music: The Knack (\u201cMy Bologna\u201d), Michael Jackson (\u201cEat It\u201d), Madonna (\u201cLike a Surgeon\u201d), Coolio (\u201cAmish Paradise\u201d), Nirvana (\u201cSmells Like Nirvana\u201d) and Robin Thicke (\u201cWord Crimes\u201d).\n\u201cThe smaller tours cleansed the palate for me and were fun for my band and the hardcore fans,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now we\u2019re back playing the big tent. We\u2019re ramping up the silliness.\u201d\nThat includes reviving not just old songs but also old bits. \u201cSome fans feel comfort in repetition, which is OK,\u201d he says. While he\u2019ll change up individual jokes, \u201cwe\u2019re trying not to change too much what people came to see \u2014 if we don\u2019t fulfill their expectations, they\u2019re liable to walk away disappointed.\u201d\n(His fans are committed enough that some even parody his songs with their own rewrites. Yankovic is particularly impressed by Steve Goodie, who parodied his \u201cHardware Store\u201d with \u201cDumbledore\u201d and even has a one-man show called \u201cAL! The Weird Tribute (and How Daniel Radcliffe Got Mixed Up in This Nonsense).\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fun and gratifying and a little \u2018Inception\u2019-like,\u201d Yankovic says, although he has yet to parody Goodie\u2019s parody.)\nAnd so band newcomer Probyn Gregory, a musician who worked with Brian Wilson, Paul McCartney, Billy Joel and Eric Clapton, spends \u201cSmells Like Nirvana\u201d dressed like a janitor and mopping the stage as part of the performance. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing artist, but you can\u2019t have a sense of shame and be part of this entourage,\u201d Yankovic says.\nFor the most part, of course, Yankovic is putting Gregory and the other multi-instrumentalists he hired to more practical uses \u2014 three of them are women because he wanted three-part female harmonies, but between them they also can add percussion, guitar, saxophones and more. \u201cI needed somebody that could play the trumpet and then someone to play clarinet for the polkas,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the arenas, I hear our sound and think, \u2018Wow, this is much, much bigger than it\u2019s ever been.\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s also more layered, with all those instruments enabling him to \u201cstretch and do songs that were out of our reach as a five-piece.\u201d\nTo show off his band, Yankovic drops the funny stuff at one point in each show, covering a classic song and playing it straight. In recent weeks, the group has played Paul Simon\u2019s \u201cYou Can Call Me Al,\u201d George Harrison\u2019s \u201cWhat Is Life,\u201d the Box Top\u2019s \u201cThe Letter,\u201d the Doobie Brothers\u2019 \u201cChina Grove,\u201d and even Helen Reddy\u2019s \u201cI Am Woman.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rotating slot and almost every night is something different,\u201d he says. The fans get into it, he says, although when he talks to them about it, he sometimes finds their reactions \u201cbaffling.\u201d\n\u201cPeople sometimes say, \u2018Oh, you guys can really play. You can really do real music,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you think we\u2019ve been doing? Just because the words are funny, it\u2019s not real music?\u201d\nYankovic is a \u201cpop culture sponge\u201d and has always listened to various music genres, first for pleasure and then for work. \u201cI just like to soak it in and regurgitate it in my own demented way,\u201d he says. But he was also raised on Dr. Demento, and was heavily influenced by Spike Jones, Tom Lehrer, Allan Sherman, and Monty Python. Those comedians taught him that craftsmanship matters even, or especially, when you\u2019re being silly.\n\u201cI think that the craftsmanship is one of the reasons that the humor works so well and I think the best parody is material that emulates the original source as closely as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps the joke if you\u2019re sucked into thinking you\u2019re listening to a particular pop song and then think, \u2018Wait a minute, these aren\u2019t the lyrics I\u2019m used to.\u2019\u201d\nFor that to work, the craftsmanship in his writing and arranging must be matched by the musicianship in his band; he hopes his audience appreciates both sides of that coin.\nHe adds that he thinks he personally has improved over time. \u201cI think I\u2019m a better singer now than I was in the \u201980s and I\u2019m a better musician and a better arranger,\u201d he says.\nEven with the four newcomers, Yankovic relies heavily on his original band. \u201cI\u2019ve got one of the best bands in the world and they do every genre flawlessly, and that\u2019s what helps make the whole act work,\u201d he says. \u201cThe core band has been together for over 40 years and we\u2019re kind of telepathic in the way we communicate now, so we\u2019re a lot better than we were back in the day.\u201d"

      "text": "Public defender\u2019s office seeks removal of Trump\u2019s top federal prosecutor in L.A.\n- Share via\nThe federal public defender\u2019s office in Los Angeles filed a motion Friday to disqualify acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli, arguing that the Trump administration\u2019s pick to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Southern California is unlawfully occupying his post.\nEssayli, a former Riverside County assemblyman, was appointed by U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi in April, and his term was set to expire in late July unless he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate or a panel of federal judges. But the White House never moved to nominate him to a permanent role, instead opting to use an unprecedented legal maneuver to shift his title to \u201cacting,\u201d extending his term another nine months without any confirmation process.\nThe federal public defender\u2019s office filed a motion seeking to dismiss an indictment against their client and to disqualify Essayli and attorneys working under him \u201cfrom participating in criminal prosecutions in this district.\u201d\nThe defendant, Jaime Ramirez, was indicted on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\nIn a 63-page motion filed in Ramirez\u2019s case, James Anglin Flynn and Ayah A. Sarsour, deputy federal public defenders, argued that the Trump administration circumvented limitations that Congress has imposed on temporary service in key offices, including U.S. attorneys.\nEssayli\u2019s term was supposed to expire on July 29. At that point the White House had not formally nominated him before the U.S. Senate, and local federal judges had taken no action to confirm Essayli, or anyone else, to the position. At the eleventh hour, the White House named Essayli as acting U.S. attorney, allowing him to hold the post for 210 more days without confirmation hearings.\nEssayli \u201cwas not lawfully acting as the United States Attorney in any capacity\u201d on Aug. 13, when the government obtained the indictment against Ramirez, the deputy federal public defenders wrote in their motion. \u201cAnd he has no such lawful authority today.\u201d\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office in L.A. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment.\nIn their motion, Flynn and Sarsour pointed out that the Trump administration has used similar strategies to keep political allies in power in U.S. attorney\u2019s offices in New Jersey, Nevada, New Mexico and the Northern District of New York. But legal challenges are mounting. Last week, a federal judge ruled that Alina Habba has been illegally occupying her seat in New Jersey since early July, although that order was put on hold pending appeal.\nHabba was nominated for the post earlier this year but did not receive Senate or judicial confirmation. Instead, local federal judges chose Desiree Leigh Grace, a veteran Republican prosecutor within the office, to replace Habba. Bondi responded by firing Grace and naming Habba acting U.S. attorney, sparking confusion over who actually held the post and all but paralyzing the federal criminal court system in the Garden State.\nOn Tuesday, the federal public defender\u2019s office in Nevada filed a motion to do one of two things: dismiss an indictment that acting U.S. Atty. Sigal Chattah brought against one of its clients, or disqualify the U.S. attorney\u2019s office entirely. The 59-page motion specifically challenged Chattah, stating that she is not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney.\nEchoing Judge Matthew W. Brann\u2019s ruling on Habba, the Nevada public defenders argued that Chattah was not first an assistant U.S. attorney, as federal law required when the U.S. attorney seat became vacant.\nThe motion also argues that Chattah was illegally kept in office past the 120-day limit and can\u2019t exercise the powers of the office without Senate confirmation.\n\u201cThe Court should dismiss the indictment; at a minimum, it should disqualify Ms. Chattah from this prosecution, as well as attorneys operating under her direction; and the judges of this district should exercise their authority to appoint a proper interim U.S. Attorney,\u201d the Nevada motion read.\nLast month, in the final days before Chattah\u2019s interim appointment ended, more than 100 retired state and federal judges wrote Nevada\u2019s chief federal district judge to urge him not to appoint her once her term expired. The group said Chattah\u2019s history of \u201cracially charged, violence-tinged, and inflammatory public statements\u201d was disqualifying.\nThe letter called Chattah\u2019s interim appointment \u201ca troubling pattern by the Trump administration of bypassing the Senate\u2019s constitutional role in confirming U.S. Attorneys.\u201d\nAccording to the letter, as of July, Trump had submitted formal nominations for only nine of his administration\u2019s 37 interim appointees.\n\u201cIf this pattern persists, by late fall, more than one-third of the 93 U.S. Attorneys will have evaded Senate review this year alone,\u201d the letter read. \u201cYet, the constitutional role of the Senate is vital regarding the appointment of U.S. Attorneys.\u201d\nEach of Trump\u2019s controversial picks has demonstrated fealty to the president. Chattah has long upheld Trump\u2019s lie that he actually won the 2020 election. Habba \u2014 who once served as Trump\u2019s personal attorney and has no prosecutorial experience \u2014 promised to turn New Jersey \u201cred,\u201d breaking with longstanding norms of federal prosecutors eschewing partisan politics. She has also filed criminal charges against two Democratic lawmakers in the state over scuffles with immigration officers at a Newark detention facility.\nSince taking office, Essayli has doggedly pursued Trump\u2019s agenda, championing hard-line immigration enforcement in Southern California, often aping the president\u2019s language verbatim at news conferences. His tenure has sparked discord in the office, with dozens of prosecutors quitting in the face of his belligerent, scream-first management style.\nA Times investigation last month found that his aggressive pursuit of charges against people protesting immigration enforcement in Southern California has led to weak cases being rejected again and again by grand juries. A number of others have been dismissed.\nEven if Trump had formally nominated him to serve a full term as U.S. attorney, it is unlikely he would have ever appeared on the Senate floor. California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, both Democrats, are both opposed to Essayli\u2019s appointment and could have derailed any nomination by withholding what is known as their \u201cblue slip,\u201d or acknowledgment of support for a nominee.\nThe procedural blockades have drawn Trump\u2019s ire, and the president has challenged Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to do away with honoring the blue slip tradition. Grassley has held firm, but Trump has threatened litigation.\nLegal experts called the White House\u2019s move to keep Essayli in office unprecedented last month, and warned it could affect criminal cases.\n\u201cThese laws have never been used, as far as I can see, to bypass the Senate confirmation process or the judicial one,\u201d Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor in L.A. who now serves as a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told The Times last month. \u201cThe most serious consequences are if you\u2019re going to end up with indictments that are not valid because they weren\u2019t signed by a lawful U.S. attorney.\u201d"

      "text": "From Lamborghinis to jail: Ex-LAPD cop accused of crypto heist with reputed Israeli mob figure\n- Share via\n- L.A. County prosecutors accused former LAPD Officer Eric Benjamin Halem of masterminding a home invasion robbery with a man with reputed ties to the Israeli underworld. About $300,000 worth of cryptocurrency, cash and jewelry were stolen from the victim, according to prosecutors.\n- One of Halem\u2019s alleged co-conspirators, Gaby Ben, was a close business associate of Moshe Matsri, whom authorities describe as an L.A. leader of the Israeli underground\n- One of Halem\u2019s side hustles, Drive-LA, boasted a fleet of rare luxury vehicles for rent, including a Bentley and a Lamborghini.\nIn December 2021, Eric Benjamin Halem was riding high.\nBeyond his day job as an LAPD officer, he was juggling several lucrative side hustles, business records and court filings show.\nPrivate security. An app for aspiring actors trying to land auditions. And an exotic car rental company, Drive-LA, that was gaining a following among rappers, influencers and executives.\nBut Halem\u2019s comfortable life soon began to unravel. He left his full-time position with the LAPD after coming under internal investigation, according to records submitted as part of a lawsuit. Earlier this year, state authorities charged him with insurance fraud.\nThen, a few weeks ago, L.A. County prosecutors accused him of masterminding a home invasion robbery with a man with reputed ties to the Israeli underworld \u2014 part of what authorities say is a growing trend of criminals targeting victims for their cryptocurrency profits.\nHow Halem, 37, became embroiled with one of his alleged co-conspirators, Gaby (sometimes spelled \u201cGabby\u201d) Ben, remains a mystery.\nBen, who has twice been convicted of fraud, was a close business associate of Moshe Matsri, or \u201cMoshe the Religious,\u201d whom authorities describe as an L.A. leader of the Israeli underground who had long operated in the San Fernando Valley and had ties to the Abergil crime syndicate, according to court filings.\nIn the early morning hours of Dec. 28, 2024, Halem, Ben and Mishael Mann, 20, made their way into an apartment building in Koreatown, LAPD Robbery-Homicide Det. Guillermo De La Riva wrote in a sworn declaration in favor of denying Halem\u2019s bail.\nA Tarzana man who prosecutors say was a leader of an Israeli crime organization was sentenced Friday in federal court to 32 years in prison for drug trafficking, money laundering and extortion.\nPierre Louis, 26, had arranged to meet up with the victim for a \u201cdigital currency transaction,\u201d which was a ruse to allow the three other men to enter the building and wait for the victim to return, De La Riva wrote.\nThe men handcuffed the victim and a second person, De La Riva wrote, ordering them at gunpoint to transfer money from a cryptocurrency account and fleeing with $300,000 worth of cryptocurrency, cash and jewelry.\nDe La Riva said he believed that after Halem\u2019s arrest, other alleged victims might come forward.\nWhen LAPD detectives arrested Halem earlier this month, they obtained search warrants for the $2.1-million home he had recently moved into in Porter Ranch, a scenic neighborhood in the Santa Susana foothills. They also reportedly recovered at least one of his guns from the home of his former police partner.\nHalem, who went by Ben professionally, has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and robbery and remains in Men\u2019s Central Jail after a judge denied his application for bail. His attorney, George G. Mgdesyan, declined to comment, saying he hadn\u2019t yet reviewed the evidence against his client.\nHalem has also pleaded not guilty in the state insurance fraud case. Ben, 51, is jailed on a federal immigration hold in Florida.\nLouis, Mann and another defendant, Luis Banuelos, have pleaded not guilty to felony charges. Their attorneys declined to comment.\nAs LAPD detectives investigated the kidnapping and robbery, they took a closer look at Halem\u2019s side businesses, according to two department sources \u2014 including whether his startup funding came from organized crime and whether his companies were a front for money laundering. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\nIn recent years, business was taking off at Drive-LA, which boasted a fleet of rare luxury vehicles for rent, including a 2020 Bentley Continental GT and a Lamborghini Urus, and had nearly 60,000 Instagram followers. With glowing media coverage and venture capitalists opening their checkbooks, Halem planned to open a second location in Phoenix.\nHe was co-hosting a podcast for car enthusiasts, and former associates told The Times that a reality show based on his life was in the works. On social media, he cultivated the image of a carefree young entrepreneur, with photos of himself posing on the steps of a private jet, at a Formula 1 race and courtside with NBA superstars Dwight Howard and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\nHalem launched an app called kaypr in 2017 that matched aspiring actors \u201cto available roles,\u201d allowing them to audition remotely from anywhere in the world. For a security firm where he had a leadership role, he worked \u201cmusic festivals, celebrity details, and large-scale events.\u201d Among his clients was action film producer Randall Emmett, who has faced fraud claims and allegations of abuse toward women. Emmett has denied the allegations.\nThe ex-fiance of reality star Lala Kent faces the collapse of his company amid a trail of lawsuits, civil fraud charges and allegations of abusive behavior.\nIn a blog post, Halem described himself as a thrill seeker who has always chased \u201cspeed, precision, and a little bit of calculated chaos.\u201d\nAccording to an online biography, Halem grew up in Los Angeles and attended UC Riverside before joining the LAPD. He spent nearly half his 13 years on the force as a training officer and was qualified as a sharpshooter.\nHis last assignment was at West Valley Division, which patrols areas featured in crimes involving suspects with ties to Israeli organized crime, including the wealthy enclave of Encino. Several former colleagues who spoke with The Times described Halem as a solid if unremarkable officer.\nIn 2014, Halem was injured during an encounter with a suspect in the West Valley area who had holed up inside an apartment and pelted officers with objects. An LAPD review board found that Halem\u2019s decision to fire a beanbag shotgun at the suspect was in line with department policy.\nBy the time he left the LAPD in 2022, Halem was pulling in $188,500 in salary and benefits, according to the Transparent California database.\nAnd his other businesses were apparently far more lucrative than his day job. In an interview with Internal Affairs detectives investigating him for insurance fraud, Halem boasted that he was raking in more than $1 million in profit annually from Drive-LA, according to a department source who reviewed the Internal Affairs file and was not authorized to discuss the matter.\nHalem was also targeted by numerous lawsuits, one of which cited a WhatsApp conversation in which an LAPD sergeant said that Halem\u2019s \u201cbusiness smells dirty\u201d and suggested that there were other LAPD officers who were \u201cinvolved in his business dealings.\u201d\n\u201c[If] there is any misconduct on their part they will be held accountable,\u201d the sergeant wrote in the WhatsApp exchange, referring to the other officers.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the LAPD investigated whether other officers were involved. The department did eventually clear Halem of the insurance fraud allegations. But his alleged misdeeds had come to the attention of the state Department of Insurance, which charged both him and his brother, Jacob Halem, with misrepresenting details in a roughly $200,000 insurance claim related to a Bentley crash in January 2023. The case is pending.\nAfter leaving his full-time LAPD job, Halem worked as an unpaid reserve officer. In March, he was stripped of his police powers after he was charged in the insurance fraud case.\nBen, who moved to the San Fernando Valley from Israel as a young adult, worked in real estate and was a partner at his late mother\u2019s restaurant.\nFederal prosecutors described him as a flashy high roller with an affinity for high-end watches. His Israeli mafia connections allowed him to launder money through Jewish-owned businesses across the Valley, prosecutors alleged in documents filed in the case.\nBen was deported after each of his fraud convictions, federal court records show. In one of the cases, prosecutors alleged that he orchestrated a so-called bust-out scheme, recruiting people to open bank accounts on his behalf in exchange for a small fee.\nHe and his brother, Amin Ben, were also accused of defrauding senior citizens by entering their homes disguised as HVAC repairmen and then photographing their driver\u2019s licenses and bank statements.\nBased on wiretaps described in a federal sworn affidavit, federal investigators believed the brothers could move freely in and out of the country, despite their legal troubles, because of Amin Ben\u2019s connection to an official at the Israeli Consulate who was \u201cable to facilitate and issue travel documents.\u201d Prosecutors also alleged that the brothers were captured on a recording threatening to kill the Israel-based family of an LAPD detective investigating one of the federal cases.\nThe check-cashing business that Ben ran with Matsri, the alleged Israeli crime boss, in an Encino strip mall was a front for alleged fraud schemes, according to a declaration filed in court by an LAPD Major Crimes detective.\nInvestigators determined that the pair bought more than 230 airline tickets, worth more than $600,000, using phone credit card approval codes and then resold the tickets to local Israelis at discount rates, an FBI agent wrote in a sworn affidavit.\nWhen they arrested Ben and Matsri in October 2010, authorities seized 16 high-end watches and a handgun from Ben\u2019s home.\nIn 2015, Matsri was sentenced in a separate federal case to 32 years in prison for drug trafficking, money laundering and extortion.\nLand records show that Ben was living in a glitzy mansion in the Hollywood Hills, where neighbors said they often saw him driving a black Rolls-Royce. The mansion\u2019s owner sued him after he stopped paying rent for five months, eventually racking up a $150,000 tab, court records show.\nBen continued to live at the residence until moving out in March."

      "text": "Deadly freeway collision devastates Southern California youth soccer community\n- Share via\nRelatives and youth soccer groups across Southern California have been left reeling after a fiery car accident killed two teenage boys, a man and a woman.\nThe deadly collision, which authorities suspect was the result of an illegal race, occurred Saturday on Interstate 15 in Temecula.\nAccording to authorities, a BMW was traveling north at a high rate of speed when it suddenly veered left and leaped over the median. The BMW collided with an oncoming Nissan Sentra, and both vehicles burst into flames.\nBMW passengers Jacob Labib, 15, and brother and sister Mina Sabet, 14, and Yostena Sabet, 22, all suffered fatal injuries and were pronounced dead at the scene, according to relatives and the Riverside County coroner\u2019s office.\nNicholas Callans, the 35-year-old driver of the Nissan, was also pronounced dead at the scene.\nIn Oxnard, a summer of immigration raids has fueled community hostility and distrust, and put city officials on the defensive.\nGirgis Alber, 23, the driver of the BMW and Yostena Sabet\u2019s fiance, was pulled from the vehicle and taken to the Inland Valley Medical Center in critical condition, the California Highway Patrol said. An unidentified passenger of the Nissan was also listed in critical condition at the medical center.\nAccording to the CHP, once Alber is treated for his injuries, he will be booked on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, child endangerment and engaging in a speed contest. The investigation continues, the CHP said.\nThe deaths have devastated family members, a church community and youth soccer players.\nJonah Labib, Jacob\u2019s father, said the boys had enjoyed a full day of competitive tournament matches at the Albion Cup in Temecula before the accident. The boys, who lived in Moreno Valley, spent most of their time together as teammates on the SoCal Reds, a youth soccer club in the Elite Academy League.\n\u201cThey had been friends since they were very little,\u201d Labib said. \u201cThey did scouts together, Sunday school together, played soccer for the same club, almost in the same positions. They were inseparable.\u201d\nSince the boys were so close, it was a regular arrangement for their families to drive them to tournaments together, Labib said. Labib had to host a church service as Father of St. George Coptic Orthodox Church in Bellflower, so after driving the boys to their morning matches, he planned for Sabet\u2019s family to drive them home.\nBut hours later, he received an emergency message from Jacob\u2019s phone and could not reach him. When he arrived at his son\u2019s location, officers informed him what had occurred.\n\u201cThe youth of the church are greatly impacted by his departure,\u201d Labib said. \u201cHe is God-fearing, extremely passionate about soccer, and a mentor to his little brothers. He was just a friend that his friends could rely on.\u201d\nLynn Perez, head of soccer operations for the SoCalReds, created a GoFundMe page to help the families cover funeral costs. The effort has so far raised over $40,000 in support.\n\u201cJacob and Mina were more than just teammates; they were friends, leaders, and an important part of our soccer family,\u201d Perez wrote. \u201cTheir warmth, kindness, and passion for the game left an impact on everyone who had the privilege of knowing them.\u201d\nThe settlement was reached five years after 15,000 gallons of jet fuel from a Delta Air Lines plane were dumped onto Cudahy, drenching children playing at a school.\nIn a SoCal Red post about the crash, several other California youth soccer clubs shared their condolences and grief.\n\u201cClaremont Stars sending these families all kinds of love and comfort,\u201d said the Claremont Stars football club.\n\u201cThe entire Rangers FC family extends our deepest condolences to the families, friends, and teammates of Jacob and Mina. Our thoughts and prayers are with you during this heartbreaking time,\u201d wrote the Rangers football club.\n\u201cThe entire OC soccer community is thinking of you and with you,\u201d said Orange County Soccer Club, a professional United Soccer League team.\nLabib said his religion would help him through this time, if nothing else.\n\u201cThe Lord has given and the Lord has taken away \u2014 Blessed be the name of the Lord,\u201d he said."

      "text": "9 great new sandwiches to try in Los Angeles\n- Share via\nSandwiches are like one of the year\u2019s best picture Oscar contenders: Everything, everywhere, all at once. Within a recent 24-hour span, I admired the contrast of soft-scrambled eggs and spicy-sweet fried chicken on a brunch sandwich at Distrito Catorce, where Jonathan Perez has a residency for his Macheen pop-up, and debated on a rainy night whether I liked the chicken parm or meatball parm more at the new Ggiata location in West Hollywood. I thought then that it made sense to push myself into looking for more newish sandwiches, from freshly minted operations to the latest creations from places that have been settling in for a year or two.\nWhat did I find? A reminder that the universal medium of sandwiches helped the food industry refocus and reinvent itself in the pandemic afterquakes. And that, as always, sandwiches are windows into the nostalgic past (New Jersey and New York deli inspiration emerged as a recurring theme) and foundations for original creative expression. These are nine new favorites, alphabetized by restaurant rather than ranked."

      "text": "Times of Troy: Six bold predictions for the USC football team in 2025\n- Share via\nWelcome back to the Times of Troy newsletter, and the happiest of birthdays to my son, Camden, who turns 2 today. Judging by how often he\u2019s pointing at the TV and screaming for me to turn on NFL preseason games, I\u2019d say he is as ready for \u201cball ball\u201d season as anyone.\nFortunately for him \u2014 and us \u2014 we are less than two weeks out from USC\u2019s season opener against Missouri State. There\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know. But before we walk our way through the schedule next week, it\u2019s time to get on the record with a few things I think might happen with USC..\nHere are six bold predictions for the Trojans in 2025:\nJayden Maiava will throw for 30 touchdowns this season. But he\u2019ll also throw 15 interceptions.\nMaiava made a concerted effort over the summer to eliminate the back-breaking mistakes he struggled with last season. He dug deeper into Lincoln Riley\u2019s offense, and he worked on his mechanics with the experts at the 3DQB training academy. But Maiava\u2019s style is always going to lend itself to high variance. He loves to chuck it deep and still seems to throw it too often into coverage. That\u2019s going to yield some thrilling results at times on an offense that should be more conducive to big plays. But 4.3% of his passes last season were deemed turnover-worthy by Pro Football Focus. That was third-highest in the Big Ten and too high for USC\u2019s offense to reach its potential. His big-time throw rate was also third-highest in the Big Ten at 5.1%, though, and that was before he fully grasped the Trojans offense. There\u2019s room to grow here. But I\u2019d caution that his proclivity for throwing caution to the wind might just be a part of the deal with Maiava.\nUSC will be shuffling its offensive line all season.\nUSC hasn\u2019t really had a reliable front since Riley\u2019s first season, and this is by far his most unproven unit yet. The interior is a legitimate concern if DJ Wingfield isn\u2019t deemed eligible. I expect at some point this season we\u2019ll see a former walk-on (Kilian O\u2019Connor) and a preferred walk-on (Kaylon Miller) start a game at center and guard, respectively. And while both should be commended for their development, that\u2019s not a good sign for USC\u2019s offense. The Trojans desperately need Elijah Paige to deliver on his huge potential this season at left tackle, Alani Noa to iron out some of his inconsistencies at right guard, and Tobias Raymond to live up to Riley\u2019s billing of him as one of the best players on the team. That\u2019s a lot to ask. Expect many different combinations up front for USC, with J\u2019Onre Reed, Micah Banuelos and Justin Tauanuu also logging starts throughout. That\u2019s eight different starters on the line, which would be the most since Riley took over at USC.\nUSC will have two 1,000-yard receivers.\nThe last time a duo of Trojan receivers crossed that mark was 2019, so not that long ago, but it\u2019s been pretty rare around college football the past decade. Less than two teams on average per year, to be exact. Still, I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say Ja\u2019Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon both cross that mark. Lemon\u2019s last eight games of 2024 put him on pace for more than 1,000 yards already, and that was with a much less potent downfield passing game for most of the season. Lane might be the more unlikely of the two to reach this mark, but I\u2019m betting on talent. He has to see more targets this season. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a target share for the two of them that nears 50%. In the bowl game, the two of them saw a combined 18 targets, a 46% target share.\nWalker Lyons will be USC\u2019s most productive tight end.\nThis is no shade on Lake McRee, who has been a reliable tentpole of the Trojans\u2019 attack for a while now. But Lyons is just the sort of tight end that should thrive in Riley\u2019s offense. More than anyone Riley has worked with yet at USC, Lyons is more in the mold of Mark Andrews, who emerged as one of the top tight ends in college football in Riley\u2019s first season at Oklahoma. Like Andrews, he came to college as more of a skilled receiver learning to play inline. Now it\u2019s clear he\u2019s ready for the next step. A breakout season could be incoming.\nUSC will have three first-round picks next April.\nA look at recent history might suggest that I\u2019m crazy. USC had three players drafted total last spring and haven\u2019t seen three Trojans drafted in the first round since 2009. Alas, I\u2019m still not deterred. Either or both of Lemon and Lane could hear their names called in the first round. Kamari Ramsey might have been a first-round pick last season, if he\u2019d declared, and Gentry has all the tools to make it happen. It\u2019s not crazy to think that others could enter the chat too. With a huge breakout season, Maiava, Paige and defensive tackle Devan Thompkins are intriguing cases to consider. Though, the first round might be a bit too optimistic.\nUSC will rediscover its pass rush.\nCount me as someone who believes USC\u2019s defense takes another step forward. And I expect that progress will be most apparent in the defensive front, where USC could barely conjure a pass rush last season. Braylan Shelby led the 2024 defense with \u2026 three measly sacks. I expect we\u2019ll see five different Trojan pass rushers pass that number this season. Gentry and sophomore Kameryn Fountain are both capable of reaching double-digit sacks, while Shelby, Anthony Lucas and freshman Jahkeem Stewart each are sure to chip in a handful on their own. Judging by early praise, Stewart could very well be the team\u2019s best pass rusher by December.\nHave your own bold takes or predictions that you want to get on the record in the next Times of Troy newsletter? Send them to me at ryan.kartje@latimes.com, and I\u2019ll include some of the best ones next week.\nExtra points\n\u2014The NCAA\u2019s 2010 sanctions of USC only get more insane by the year. This week, the NCAA issued its punishment in the Michigan sign-stealing scandal. Aside from a $20-million fine, which is substantial, the punishment reflected how much has changed societally since 2010, and the reality of how toothless the NCAA has become. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2010, when the NCAA dropped the hammer on USC, taking away 30 scholarships and banning them from bowl games for two seasons amid the Reggie Bush saga, while the BCS stripped the school of its 2004 title. That punishment was devastating primarily to players who had nothing to do with the crime. This latest ruling clearly tried to avoid that, which is a commendable change from the NCAA. But it did understandably upset some USC fans who are still frustrated with how they were treated in a case that had far less of an actual influence on the field.\n\u2014Special teams coach Ryan Dougherty understands USC\u2019s placekicking hasn\u2019t been good enough. Michael Lantz hit just 14 of his 21 attempts (66.7%) last season. Denis Lynch hit 10 of 14 (71%) in 2023 and 15 of 22 in 2022 (68.2%). A few more made field goals last season might have made the difference in some of USC\u2019s narrow losses. This season, Dougherty will put his faith in sophomore Caden Chittenden, who set the Mountain West record last year for a freshman kicker with 26 made field goals. Chittenden seems like a safe bet to be a significant improvement at a position that\u2019s been lacking during Riley\u2019s tenure.\n\u2014Makai Lemon will be USC\u2019s top punt returner. Some of you might wonder why USC would invite the added risk of having Lemon return punts. But Riley wouldn\u2019t even entertain that line of thinking this week. The coach said that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing anyone would do that would keep us from playing them on punt return.\u201d Given how electric Lemon can be in the return game, I get it. USC has just one punt return touchdown during Riley\u2019s entire tenure. That unit needs to be better.\n\u2014Rawlinson Stadium is officially open. Which means the first step of USC\u2019s $200-million Athletics West capital project is complete. Reporters were invited last week on a tour of the Trojans\u2019 gleaming new soccer and lacrosse stadium, and let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a significant improvement on their old home, McAlister Field. McAlister could barely fit 1,000 people, didn\u2019t have lights and didn\u2019t even have locker rooms for the team. Rawlinson has a capacity of 2,500, a press box, viewing decks for fans and a video board, while the lockers are customized based on feedback directly from the players. Women\u2019s soccer coach Jane Alukonis made clear to reporters how much Rawlinson would influence the program\u2019s recruiting efforts. USC invested $38 million to make it happen. Now we can see why.\nIn case you missed it\nMichigan hit with major fine for sign-stealing scheme. Jim Harbaugh\u2019s NCAA exile extended 10 years\nMicah Banuelos works to make up for lost time as USC aims to build its strongest offensive line\nWhy USC is not in the AP Top 25 preseason poll\nWhat I\u2019m reading this week\nSo much has been written about Todd Marinovich over the years, but never has he written about his harrowing journey in his own words until now. In \u201cMarinovich: Outside the Lines of Football, Art, and Addiction\u201d, the former USC quarterback opens up a vein, giving readers an unvarnished look at how he went from child prodigy and \u201cRobo Quarterback\u201d to drug addict and NFL washout. It\u2019s rare that athletes really examine themselves at the level that Marinovich does in this autobiography. He even tries to correct the record about his father, Marv, who he writes was a \u201cthorny scapegoat.\u201d\nIf you find Marinovich and his story of redemption at all interesting, I\u2019d recommend checking it out.\nUntil next time ...\nThat concludes today\u2019s newsletter.

      "text": "Orange County will fight Trump over sensitive voter information, despite pushback\n- Share via\nOrange County leaders are vowing to fight the Trump administration over the release of sensitive voter data to the Department of Justice after the agency sued for the information in June.\nThe fight marks a test for county leaders, who have been divided over whether to resist demands by the U.S. Justice Department for records related to alleged voting irregularities, an issue Trump has championed since losing the 2020 election.\nRepublican Supervisors Don Wagner and Janet Nguyen on Tuesday sought support from the rest of the board to comply with the federal government\u2019s request to turn over voter registration records of 17 individuals who were ineligible to cast a ballot but had appeared on the county\u2019s voter registration rolls.\nInstead, a majority of the board voted against the request, with several noting they preferred to let a judge decide whether the information should ultimately be released.\nThe vote, county lawyers said, wouldn\u2019t be enough to force the county registrar to turn over any information anyway since the county isn\u2019t named in the lawsuit. But experts say the move signals a willingness in this onetime conservative stronghold to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to expand federal power and seek sensitive information on individuals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of posturing of whether or not there is allegiance to the Trump administration [by] obeying in advance,\u201d said Jodi Balma, a political science professor at Fullerton College. \u201cThe reality is, nobody\u2019s dying on the hill of 17 voter registrations.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has begun to ramp up scrutiny of how the country\u2019s elections are carried out, particularly in relation to noncitizen voting.\nThe Justice Department has sent letters to at least 26 states requesting details about voters, election administrative processes and election officials. Many of those states received specific requests for statewide voter registration lists.\nWagner said in an interview on Thursday that he didn\u2019t see any upside to Orange County fighting the federal government on this issue, especially during a time when California, in particular, is under intense scrutiny by the Trump administration.\n\u201cIt does appear the the governor and the president are trying to score rhetorical points against each other,\u201d Wagner said, \u201cand the president has already said to all these sanctuary jurisdictions in California that he\u2019s trying to withhold money from them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been the whipping boy at the state and federal levels,\u201d he added, \u201cand I just don\u2019t want to be caught in the middle of this.\u201d\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has sued the Orange County Registrar of Voters in an effort to get details about the records of noncitizens.\nThe lawsuit, filed against the county\u2019s registrar of voters, stems from a June 2 letter the Justice Department sent to county election officials seeking information on people who had been removed from voter rolls beginning in January 2020 because they weren\u2019t eligible to cast a ballot. The lawsuit states that federal officials were responding to a complaint made by the relative of a noncitizen who received a mail-in ballot.\nThe county responded by sending information on 17 individuals, including their names and addresses, who either self-reported being noncitizens or whose ineligibility was confirmed by the Orange County district attorney\u2019s office. Those individuals were removed from the voter rolls.\nDist. Atty. Todd Spitzer told the Board of Supervisors during Tuesday\u2019s meeting that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the county.\nStill, the federal government took issue with redactions the county made before sending the documents. The county removed Social Security numbers, California identification numbers, voter identification numbers and scans of the voters\u2019 signatures, a move county attorneys argue balances federal disclosure and California laws that limit sharing private information.\nCounty officials said the Department of Justice claimed it needed the registrants\u2019 Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers to verify that the registrar\u2019s office is complying with the Help America Vote Act, a 2002 law that made sweeping reforms to the country\u2019s voting process.\nThe Department of Justice did not respond to a request from The Times seeking additional details about how the data would be used.\n\u201cThere is a long history of Republicans focused on vote fraud nationally that doesn\u2019t end up turning out to be large numbers,\u201d said Jon Gould, dean of the school of social ecology at UC Irvine. \u201cAnd it would seem that this is consistent with that.\u201d\nMany Republicans who supported Trump\u2019s call to deport undocumented criminals have expressed hesitation about immigration sweeps targeting workers and longtime residents.\nHe added it was unclear how the additional information would help the federal government get to the root of a voting integrity problem. \u201cI can\u2019t for the life of me figure out what they\u2019re after other than to keep the controversy going,\u201d he said.\nThe county\u2019s lawyers offered to produce the redacted information as long as it was under a protective order or confidentiality agreement that would permit the federal government to use the data only for election enforcement purposes. The Department of Justice did not respond to the proposal, according to a county spokesperson.\nSupervisor Katrina Foley, a Democrat, said the reason she voted against her colleagues\u2019 request was simple. The registrar of voters doesn\u2019t have the authority under state and federal law to disclose the information, she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re following the law. It\u2019s not like this is a gray area where we might have a legal analysis that comes to a different opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is black and white law. The way this gets resolved is simply for the court to order the disclosure.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nKyle Schwarber\u2019s last swing Thursday night was a disappointment. He\u2019d hit four home runs, and in the eighth inning had a chance to become the first player in major league history to hit a fifth. He popped up.\nBy doing so, however, the Philadelphia Phillies designated hitter averted a certain controversy and cries that his accomplishment was tainted.\nWhy? Because the pitcher he faced was Atlanta Braves infielder Vidal Bruj\u00e1n, a position player mopping up the last inning of the Phillies\u2019 19-4 victory at Citizens Bank Park.\nBruj\u00e1n lobbed a 57.4-mph pitch over the middle of the plate. Schwarber hit it straight into the air for an infield fly rule out. Controversy averted.\nBy going deep in the first, fourth, fifth and seventh innings. Schwarber became the 21st player to hit four home runs in a game, an accomplishment even more rare than a perfect game, 24 of which have been pitched.\nSchwarber was only the fourth player to get a chance to hit a fifth homer, joining Mike Cameron (2002), Lou Gehrig (1932) and Bobby Lowe (1894). Everyone else on the list hit their fourth home run in their last at-bat.\n\u201cI thought he was going to do it, I really did,\u201d Phillies manager Rob Thomson told reporters after the game. \u201cThere was no doubt in my mind.\u201d\nSchwarber was less sure. He has 333 career home runs and an NL-leading 49 this season, but has zero home runs in 15 plate appearances against position players, against whom he is two for 10 with two walks, two hit-by-pitches and one sacrifice fly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a mental block somewhere in my head that I\u2019m not very good against position players,\u201d Schwarber said.\nHis difficulty is an anomaly. Bruj\u00e1n has an earned-run average of 27.00 in three career pitching appearances, having given up two home runs and nine runs in three innings.\nNot wanting to further tax their overworked bullpen, the Dodgers bring Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez in to pitch the final 2 1/3 innings of blowout loss to Padres.\nThe Dodgers have used two position players to finish games this season. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez has an ERA of 15.10 in 5 1/3 innings and Miguel Rojas has a 12.60 ERA in five innings, including two in a 16-0 loss to the Cubs when he had the dugout laughing by imitating his teammates.\nRojas wore Yoshinobu Yamamoto\u2019s blue glove, wiggled the ball in it and hesitated during his windup. He imitated Clayton Kershaw, raising his glove high above his head going into the stretch. He tried to look like rookie Roki Sasaki, bending his back knee and lifting his front leg uncomfortably high before releasing the pitch.\nAll of which took a bit of the sting out of the Dodgers\u2019 worst shutout loss in franchise history.\n\u201cI guess a little bit of levity in a game like that is certainly helpful,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cIt just shows [Rojas] watches the games. To be able to throw two innings was huge for us, and we needed every bit of that.\u201d\nYet the ERA of position players pitching since 2021 has been about 10.00, according to FanGraphs. Not everybody is laughing.\nRoki Sasaki gave up one run in five sturdy innings, but the Cubs handed the Dodgers a 16-0 loss that ended with infielder Miguel Rojas on the mound imitating teammates.\nWhy do position players find themselves on the mound? The practice is stomached by managers who want to protect their actual pitchers from overuse. It\u2019s a way of throwing in the towel, waving the white flag, wishing for the mercy rule used in youth baseball.\nMLB has acknowledged that the prevalence of position players pitching has become a problem, with critics saying the practice makes a mockery of the game and affects the validity of statistics \u2014 a sacred part of baseball.\nAs Times assistant sports editor Houston Mitchell wrote, \u201cMight as well bring in the stilts guy from the Savannah Bananas to pitch.\u201d\nMLB responded in 2023 by implementing a rule restricting the use of position players pitching to games in which a team is trailing by at least eight runs at any point, leading by 10 runs in the ninth inning, or in extra innings.\nIt hasn\u2019t done much to stem the tide. Teams are on pace this season to challenge the 2022 record of 132 pitching appearances by position players. As recently as 2008, there were only three such pitching appearances and in 2006 there were none.\nSo Schwarber hitting a historic fifth home run off anyone other than a legitimate pitcher would have triggered howls from purists and anyone else who believes crushing a 57.4-mph pitch into the stands is a joke.\nIf you\u2019re a Japanese company wanting to get the word out in America about your product, you\u2019re in good company at Dodger Stadium.\nAs it was, belting four homers was quite a feat. Schwarber is the fourth Phillies player to do so, joining Mike Schmidt (1976), Chuck Klein (1936) and Ed Delahanty (1896). He also was the third player to do so this season, joining Eugenio Su\u00e1rez of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Nick Kurtz of the Athletics.\nOthers on the short list include the Dodgers\u2019 Shawn Green in 2002, who in a 16-3 win over the Brewers also doubled and singled to set a record with 19 total bases.\nSchwarber got an early start with a 450-foot solo homer in the first inning and a two-run shot in the third. He added a three-run homer in the fifth and finished with another three-run blast in the seventh inning.\nWhen it looked as if he\u2019d get one last at-bat in the eighth, Schwarber yelled out a question while hitting in the underground batting cage adjacent to the dugout.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have even asked the question, but I was like, \u2018How many guys have hit five?\u2019\u201d Schwarber said. \u201cAnd nobody said anything, so I was like, \u2018Oh, OK, well, that answers the question.\u2019\u201d\nThanks to his pop fly against Bruj\u00e1n, the answer remains the same: Nobody.\nAnd thanks to his pop fly against Bruj\u00e1n, nobody can complain that a cherished record was broken in a way that would have raised the ire of many."

      "text": "Supervisor Hilda Solis says she\u2019ll run for Congress if new maps are approved\n- Share via\nBacked by a hefty list of prominent endorsers, Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has officially kicked off her bid for a southeast L.A. County congressional seat, should new district maps be approved by California voters in November.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been standing up for the people \u2014 and against Trump \u2014 as a Supervisor, and now it\u2019s time to campaign for the House and fight for the people and democracy in the Congress,\u201d Solis said in a statement Friday.\nThe former secretary of Labor, 67, previously served in Congress and the statehouse before becoming a county supervisor.\nSolis\u2019 campaign launch included endorsements from five sitting members of Congress, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, among others.\nThe heavyweight list speaks to the legislator\u2019s deep backing in local Democratic politics. It also doubles as a warning to other potential candidates about the establishment firepower behind Solis\u2019 nascent campaign, despite the seat she\u2019s angling for not actually existing yet.\nSolis would run in the redrawn 38th District, which is currently represented by Rep. Linda S\u00e1nchez (D-Whittier). Should the maps pass, S\u00e1nchez is likely planning to run in the redrawn 41st District, which will include her home of Whittier, leaving the new 38th District without an incumbent candidate. Both districts will be heavily Democratic.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s push to redraw California\u2019s district maps to favor Democrats will be decided by voters in a Nov. 4 special election \u2014 a decision that could potentially determine the balance of power in the Congress in 2026. The plan punches back at President Trump\u2019s drive for more GOP House seats in Texas and other states.\nThe Times reported this month that Solis was lining up support for a potential candidacy even before the new maps were finalized. At least one California lawmaker told The Times that Solis referred to the district as \u201cmy seat\u201d when asking for backing \u2014 a reference to the seat she once held, even though the new district doesn\u2019t yet exist. Solis confirmed her candidacy to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune on Thursday.\nAlong with Sanchez, former Obama administration staffer TJ Adams-Falconer has also filed campaign fundraising paperwork in the district."

      "text": "- Share via\nOn a recent Saturday in July, as the sun set behind East L.A. club Don Quixote, a line of black-clothed and face-pierced youths chattered excitedly outside the venue.\nInside, luchadores were raring to wrestle, as alternative musicians touched up their eyeliner in anticipation of their performances at the Lucha Goth Haus \u2014 a recurring variety show in which the iconic Mexican sport of lucha libre meets the sounds of dark wave and industrial music.\nThe crowd\u2019s alternative style was imbued with Latin flair: Latinos in black vaquero boots clicked their heels against the concrete, while lace veils flowed above their carefully teased hair. Many of their faces, painted a ghostly white, were framed by embroidered Tejano hats \u2014 and one massive mariachi sombrero.\nAmong the city\u2019s Latino community, a gothic renaissance is growing. In the music, fashion and expression that incorporates post-punk rebellion into Latin American culture, Angelenos are reviving a decades-long countercultural tradition, while redefining outdated ideas of what goth can be.\nIn recent pop culture, goth Latinos were placed firmly in the foreground of Tim Burton\u2019s hit Netflix series \u201cWednesday.\u201d Inspired by the classic television-turned-film series \u201cThe Addams Family,\u201d Jenna Ortega plays the beloved character Wednesday Addams, who dresses only in black and wields a brooding stare.\nOrtega, who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, sparked a fashion movement among her young fans, who dressed in the character\u2019s signature dark, macabre style. Ortega\u2019s role as Wednesday has helped expand a renewed interest in goth culture.\nLuis Guzm\u00e1n, the actor continuing the legacy of fellow Puerto Rican performer Raul Julia as Gomez Addams, said that \u201cWednesday\u201d represents an embracing of the weird and unusual: \u201cOur show shows people that it\u2019s OK to be who you are no matter what,\u201d the actor told The Times in July. \u201cIt\u2019s not about fitting in \u2014 it\u2019s just about living your life, and it\u2019s OK to be how you are.\u201d\nAs Ortega and Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s characters have placed \u201cunusual\u201d Latinos in the mainstream, L.A.\u2019s goth Latino community is thriving more than ever.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Latinos are \u2018taking over\u2019 the goth scene in L.A.,\u201d said Francisco Saenz, drummer for L.A. post-punk band Deceits. \u201cI would say we are the scene.\u201d\nOn any given night, roaming bands of proud Latino alternative kids can find each other in the streets and music venues of L.A., seeking a sense of gothic sanctuary and community solidarity.\nThe L.A.-born community collective LosGothsCo has made a name for itself by hosting events that celebrate Latino culture in tandem with the spirit of alternative experimentation that defines the goth community.\nEddie Escalante, a Salvadoran American artist who fuses Latin urban sounds with atmospheric rock, performed at the collective\u2019s Lucha Goth Haus show in a purple-lit wrestler\u2019s cage, with silver paint glinting from his neck and his guitar strings.\n\u201cThe newer musicians like me, we\u2019re uniting those old and new, who feel like reggaet\u00f3n isn\u2019t the only genre Latinos can love and be represented by,\u201d said Escalante. \u201cBut it can be alternative too.\u201d\nIn an alleyway outside the venue, Deceits\u2019 lead vocalist, Kevin Moreno, echoed Escalante\u2019s sentiments.\n\u201cWe might love goth, but we also love to have fun \u2014 puro desmadre,\u201d said Moreno. \u201cWhen you think of goth, you think of brooding. But we\u2019re all just people who love the music. We\u2019re embracing those musical roots but we add our own flavor to it.\u201d\nGoth, as its known today, is marked by a love for the macabre. Gothic art, architecture and literature are defined by a dark romanticism and otherworldliness, from the famous raven at Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s door to the stony Gothic cathedrals of Europe, hallmarked by their ornate, archways pointed toward the heavens.\nMusically, goth formed from the ashes of England\u2019s punk scene. The jagged guitar riffs of the 1970s were refined by shadowy post-punk bands like Joy Division and Bauhaus, which then paired well with the mystical echoes of synths deployed by the Cure, the Smiths and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Outside the U.K., African American blues singer Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins was leaving spellbinding impressions on an Australian avant-gardist named Nick Cave.\nMeanwhile, in Latin America, the mournful tones of traditional boleros and rancheras gave way to more alternative expressions of heartache, influenced by anglophone artists and accented with distinctly Latino flourishes of romance. As rock en espa\u00f1ol acts like Los Prisioneros and Soda Stereo swept South America with their takes on new wave, Mexican rock band Caifanes blended post-punk melancholia with folk tradition in their 1988 cover of the Cuban cumbia song \u201cLa Negra Tomasa\u201d \u2014 a perfect marriage of Latin American and goth sensibilities.\n\u201cThe goth scene in L.A. is definitely having a renaissance right now,\u201d said Carla Carrillo, a local nurse and longtime goth. \u201cI\u2019ve been goth for years, and now there\u2019s so many new bands coming out ... events, clubs and people entering the scene. And L.A. is where it\u2019s happening.\u201d\nLatino goths in the local music and event space also use their platforms for more than representing a subculture \u2014 they also show support for immigrants, especially as ICE continues targeting communities across Southern California, fueled by Trump\u2019s promise of the \u201clargest mass deportation operation\u201d in American history.\nDeceits drummer Saenz is a teacher in a neighborhood made up almost entirely of children of immigrants. For Moreno and Saenz, who are children of immigrants themselves, speaking up just made sense.\nTheir latest performance, which took place at a newer goth night at Hollywood\u2019s Knucklehead Club called SexBeat, raised funds for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights.\nRey Garcia, organizer of SexBeat, is another mainstay of the scene. Having amassed a following online using the nickname \u201cGoth Tio,\u201d Garcia inspires young goths to dance unabashedly \u2014 in his videos, he swings his own body to industrial and funk music, while wearing a signature black vaquero hat.\nGarcia believes that helping immigrants is an essential tenet of the L.A. goth philosophy.\n\u201cThis is just kind of how the goth community operates. Let\u2019s get together, let\u2019s listen to the music we love and still support the people that are being directly impacted by these issues,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole resurgence from people just discovering goth for the first time, and I want them to feel that acceptance that I felt.\u201d\nAndres Martinez, co-founder of events collective LosGothsCo, still remembers the significance of helping to organize what would become the group\u2019s signature event: Gothicumbia. (Imagine a late-night carne asada, but with more haunting music.)\n\u201cIt was one of those nights where you just felt like something cool was about to happen,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cEven for that first time, it felt familiar, like a family party of some sort. At the end of the night, when the dance floor\u2019s poppin\u2019 and you\u2019re looking around ... you\u2019re like, man, it feels so cool to be part of this. People were relating to the event, to each other.\u201d\nFrom its humble beginnings at downtown dive bar La Cita, Gothicumbia has drawn black sheep from all over the city \u2014 and has since traveled from Riverside to San Francisco.\nLosGothsCo held its Gothicumbia homecoming party on Aug. 15 at the Regent in downtown L.A., where a grimly fiendish procession of DJs spinning the sounds of cumbia, new Latin alternative, post-punk and rock en espa\u00f1ol.\nAs leather-clad Latinos entered the theater, they were greeted with giant skeletons, handheld rave lights and a packed dance floor.\n\u201cI grew up [in] a time where there weren\u2019t nightclubs like this for us,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt was either being the black sheep at the Latin clubs or going to the goth club that was always playing the same music. Gothicumbia was something I wish I had when I first started out in the scene.\u201d\nBesides its musical offerings, Gothicumbia has developed a reputation for harboring the most inventive Latin goth fashion. Women arrive adorned with black lace hairpieces and painted tears a la Virgencita, as men blend dark accents with their Chicano workwear and vaquero boots.\nDaisy Linsangan is a familiar face at local goth nights \u2014 most recently found dancing at Gothicumbia in August, lost in the sounds of the Cure and Anecito Molina. Best known by her online and go-go dancing moniker, hell_fairy, she twirls in lace and leather, both on and offstage.\n\u201cI feel like with any fashion, it is a tool to express yourself, and when you express yourself, you show your most true authentic self,\u201d Linsangan said.\n\u201cWhen I go to my nine-to-five [job], I don\u2019t have my white face paint on. I have to speak in a certain way, kind of white-coded. When I can go out on these nights, I feel like I can truly be myself.\u201d\nAfter another LosGothsCo event came to a close, there was an aura of joy that radiated from the crowd and permeated the East L.A. night air.\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d said one hair-sprayed and corseted Chicana to another. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d"

Muhammad, president of Classical California, the entity that operates the nonprofit KUSC and its sister station, KDFC in San Francisco, confirmed the workforce reduction in a note sent Thursday to its listeners.\n\u201cDespite our best efforts, the fact is that Classical California has experienced a reduction of $1.1 million in support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,\u201d Muhammad wrote. \u201cThis, along with other impacts, requires us to make difficult decisions across KUSC-FM and KDFC-FM.\u201d\nA representative for Classical California did not respond to questions on the number of employees cut.

Trump has called NPR and PBS government-funded \u201cleft-wing propaganda.\u201d\nThe Corp. for Public Broadcasting was also a vital revenue source for cultural and fine arts programming that often struggles to sustain itself in the commercial media marketplace.\nBoth KUSC and KDFC, which are owned and operated by the University of Southern California, play classical music 24 hours a day and are not NPR affiliates. They are the most-listened-to classical radio stations in the U.S.\nMuhammad\u2019s note to listeners included a plea for contributions to make up for the shortfall caused by the cuts.\n\u201cWe remain committed to continuing to be your home for classical music,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cAs a listener-supported station, we need your support of KUSC and KDFC, now more than ever.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\n- In the reopening of Ojai\u2019s Hotel El Roblar, a property that first went up in 1919, designers aimed to stress the historical feel of the rooms and grounds.\n- The hotel reopens with 50 total rooms, two dining venues and rates that hint at the town\u2019s short supply of lodging.\nDowntown Ojai\u2019s newest hotel, which is also its oldest, stands along Ojai Avenue like a rancher in his best string tie and leather vest.\nThis property, now known as Hotel El Roblar, has been a fixture on Ojai\u2019s main street for more than a century \u2014 party to multiple civic dramas, one fraud conviction, repeated closures and four decades of fitness retreats. Now, after years of negotiation and restoration, a new team of owners has reshaped the place to evoke Old California, celebrate the Ojai Valley\u2019s wild side and lure Angelenos looking to escape the city.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a hitching post outside, next to the bike rack,\u201d hotel partner Jeremy McBride pointed out, noting that horseback visits aren\u2019t out of the question.\nIn a town that\u2019s short on lodging supply, the Roblar stands out for its size, its place in local history and the way it wears that history on its walls. Oh, and the two giant tortoises out back.\nIt went up in 1919, a blend of Spanish Revival and California Mission Revival styles. Its 2 acres include 39 guest rooms, 11 bungalows, a pool, an event space, a dinner restaurant (the Condor Bar) and a breakfast-and-lunch restaurant (La Cocina). It reopened this summer with nightly rates of $455 and up.\n\u201cThere are so many trendy design hotels out there, and we certainly didn\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Eric Goode, the partner with the most longstanding ties to the area. \u201cOjai is rustic and horsey. It\u2019s not Montecito.\u201d\nThe hotel entrance is framed by an arch that echoes those in Ojai\u2019s downtown arcade building. Most of the bungalows have kiva-style fireplaces. In the Cocina breakfast-and-lunch room, the bar wall is a stack of colored bottles mortared together with concrete like a ghost town bottle-house.\nThe centerpiece of the lobby is a stacked-stone fireplace. The walls feature a wrap-around mural filled with Ojai Valley flora and fauna.\nThe room looks like it goes back a century. But the fireplace is new, rebuilt to resemble old photos. So is the mural, painted by artist Stefano Castronovo last year.\nThough Goode, 67, is best known elsewhere as an entrepreneur and maker of documentaries, he spent a chunk of his childhood in the Ojai Valley. While his father was teaching at the Thacher School, Goode said, he was \u201ccatching horned lizards and rattlesnakes and putting them in my lunchbox.\u201d\nRelax during your next trip to Ojai at these six spiritual sites, including esoteric libraries, pilgrimage sites and gorgeous natural spaces.\nLater, Goode created New York\u2019s Area nightclub/art gallery in the 1980s; took ownership roles in several hotels and restaurants, including New York\u2019s Bowery Hotel; and co-founded the nonprofit Turtle Conservancy with Maurice Rodrigues. Later still, Goode produced and directed the documentary series \u201cTiger King\u201d (2020) and \u201cChimp Crazy\u201d (2024).\nFor about 35 years, Goode said, he has kept a home in Ojai and returned frequently. Yet for most of that time, Goode said, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d do a business here.\u201d The key, he said, was finding a historic property whose reopening might feel more like a revival than a disruption to local culture.\nWhen Ojai and the Roblar were born\nThe Roblar was born as modern Ojai was taking shape between 1917 and 1920. That\u2019s when the town was renamed from Nordhoff to Ojai and local leader E.D. Libbey hired architects Richard Requa and Frank Mead to effectively reshape the city after a fire.\nThey designed the city\u2019s long arcade along Ojai Avenue; its signature post office and tower; a church that became the Ojai Valley Museum; and the Roblar, all crafted with Spanish Colonial and Mission Revival features.\nWhile Ojai\u2019s reputation spread as a sophisticated small town with a spiritual bent and spectacular setting, the Roblar prospered, faltered, was renamed the Oaks, added a bar, added a pool and added bungalows. It also added a neon sign and then subtracted it, eventually forsaking much of its original design as owners and managers came and went.\nBy one account, the hotel\u2019s early managers included a Mr. Canfield from Santa Barbara, followed by Mr. Cromwell from San Francisco, both of whom committed suicide. Later came Frank Keenan, a former Chicago alderman who bought the hotel in 1952 and in 1957 was convicted in Illinois of federal income tax evasion.\n\u201cWe hope not to follow in their footsteps,\u201d Goode said.\nThe hotel entered a different era in 1977, when fitness entrepreneur Sheila Cluff remade it as a health-oriented retreat, later passing leadership to her daughter, Cathy Cluff. The Oaks closed in 2017 after suffering smoke damage in the Thomas fire \u2014 and when the Cluff family put the property up for sale, the new owners stepped in.\nNew rooms, new art, roaming reptiles\nNobody will mistake El Roblar for a fitness retreat now. Though its pool and gym are likely to get plenty of use, the new owners are clearly focused on comfort, style and history.\nBesides Goode and McBride, who has a background as an entrepreneur and filmmaker, the partners include designer Ramin Shamshiri and restaurateur Warner Ebbink (who co-owns the Little Dom\u2019s restaurants in Los Feliz and Carpinteria and Bar Lou in Montecito).\nThe sale closed in September 2019. Then the pandemic arrived. It took six years of design, permit negotiations with the city, restoration and construction before the hotel reopened under its original name.\nBecause the the Oaks was run as a mostly private fitness retreat, McBride said, the restart of the hotel means \u201cit\u2019s really open to the community for the first time in 50 years.\u201d\nIts dinner restaurant, the Condor Bar, led by executive chef Brandon Boudet, opened July 17, serving \u201cCalifornia Mexican\u201d cuisine and using a Santa Maria-style wood-fired grill. Work continues on the eight guest rooms in the hotel\u2019s Sycamore building, scheduled to open in mid-September.\nAcross Ventura Street from the hotel, the new owners have also bought a property that once housed World University (which closed in 2017). Their plan still needs city approval, but the hotel owners have said they aim to open a 9,000-square-foot spa and wellness facility \u201cto complement the hotel\u201d in the next 18 to 24 months.\nThe overarching idea, McBride said, is for the Roblar space to feel \u201cnot like a new, fancy hotel, but something that\u2019s always been here.\u201d\nThe public areas and guest rooms are filled with custom and antique furniture and more than 1,000 pieces of art, many of them from California Auctioneers in Casitas Springs and Early California Antiques in Oxnard. The walls of the restaurant are crowded full of condor images and artifacts \u2014 \u201clike you\u2019re having dinner in your favorite natural history museum,\u201d McBride said.\nIn the walled garden by the hotel\u2019s bungalows, two Aldabra giant tortoises, Abra and Cadabra, creep between sun and shade. (They\u2019re on loan from the Turtle Conservancy. For $100 per adult, Roblar guests can sign up for a tour of the conservancy\u2019s Ojai property, which includes about 500 turtles and tortoises.)\nWhat Ojai visitors need to know about booking a stay.\nThe hotel\u2019s website notes that the property and its fireplaces, balconies and lifeguard-less pool are \u201cdesigned for adults\u201d and that \u201cwe discourage children [as overnight guests] for safety reasons.\u201d Dogs under 60 pounds are welcome (with a $250 fee). Also, photography and video recording \u201care not permitted in shared spaces,\u201d though a ban on selfies might be difficult to enforce.\nThe Roblar\u2019s rates hint at the short supply of lodging in Ojai, which has drawn many entertainment industry figures yet guards its small-town character aggressively.\nThe city has about 7,600 residents and a dozen hotels. It levies one of the state\u2019s highest hotel tax rates (15%), forbids short-term vacation rentals and bans chain businesses with five or more locations. The largest hotel in town is the 303-room Ojai Valley Inn, which has its own golf course and summer rates that start around $780.\nIn 2022, the school board turned down a plan to convert a school district site into a 200-room hotel. Last year, Mayor Andy Gilman\u2019s winning campaign called for civil discourse and open minds, but warned of \u201cour over-dependence on tourism.\u201d\nParking might be the most controversial part of the Roblar\u2019s rebirth. To make room for other elements, the new owners got permission to take out the hotel\u2019s public parking lot, secure off-site parking and require that guests use valet service ($50 nightly). This satisfied city officials, but not some neighbors.\n\u201cJust another sickening display of LA $$$$. No real parking,\u201d one Ojai resident complained on Facebook.\nAwkward as these debates can be, McBride said, it\u2019s the protective attitude of Ojai residents that has helped keep the city\u2019s identity in place.\n\u201cThis place is still so special,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why people who are here want to preserve it.\u201d"

Gavin Newsom and California lawmakers on Friday announced a landmark deal with Uber and Lyft to allow hundreds of thousands of rideshare drivers to unionize and bargain collectively while still being classified as independent contractors.\nThe compromise between labor unions and the Silicon Valley companies, backed by Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, would advance a collective bargaining bill through the Legislature along with a bill backed by Uber and Lyft that would significantly reduce the companies\u2019 insurance requirements.\nThe deal is a major development in the years-long tussle between organized labor and Silicon Valley over rights for independent contractors.\nLabor leaders from Service Employees International Union California, a powerful union that has been working for years to organize app-based drivers, said the deal is the largest expansion of private sector collective bargaining rights in California history.\n\u201cLabor and industry sat down together, worked through their differences, and found common ground,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. The agreement, he said, will \u201cempower hundreds of thousands of drivers while making rideshare more affordable for millions of Californians.\u201d\nWith support from Rivas and McGuire, both bills are expected to sail through the Legislature before the session ends in mid-September. The agreement does not apply to other types of gig workers, including those who deliver food through apps like DoorDash.\nThe two bills \u201crepresent a compromise that lowers costs for riders while creating stronger voices for drivers,\u201d said Ramona Prieto, Uber\u2019s head of public policy for California, in a prepared statement.\nThe deal marks a new chapter in nearly a decade of tension between technology companies and state lawmakers over the employment status of the tens of thousands of Californians who do gig work for app-based companies.\n\u201cThis moment has been a long fight for over a decade in the making,\u201d said Tia Orr, the executive director of SEIU California.\nAfter the California Legislature in 2019 rewrote employment law in 2019, clarifying and limiting when businesses can classify workers as independent contractors, Uber and Lyft went to the ballot in California to exempt their drivers.\nWhen California voters passed Proposition 22, the ballot measure funded by Uber and Lyft, in 2020, drivers were classified as independent contractors and, under federal law, do not have the right to organize. Prop. 22 also explicitly barred drivers from collectively bargaining over their compensation, benefits and working conditions.\nBut SEIU California argued that court decisions over Prop. 22 left an opening for the state Legislature to create a process for drivers to unionize.\nEarlier this year, Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland) and Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced the collective bargaining bill, AB 1340, which Uber and Lyft initially opposed.\nThe bill allows drivers to negotiate their pay and other terms of their agreements with the companies and exempts workers from the state and federal antitrust laws that normally prohibit collective action by independent contractors.\nUnder federal law, employees in the U.S. can unionize by holding an election or reaching a voluntary agreement with their employers for a specific union to represent them.\nThe process for California Uber and Lyft drivers would be somewhat different. The bill says drivers can select a bargaining representative by collecting signatures from at least 10% of active drivers, then petitioning the state\u2019s Public Employment Relations Board for a certification.\nThat path to collective bargaining mirrors a ballot initiative approved by Massachusetts voters last fall that was also backed by SEIU, which allowed drivers to form a union after collecting signatures from at least 25% of active drivers in the state.\nVeena Dubal, a law professor at UC Irvine who studies the effect of technology on workers, said the compromise reached by California lawmakers may not be strong enough to ensure that drivers can reach a fair contract.\nThe bill does not clarify whether drivers would be protected if they collectively protested or went on strike, she said, and doesn\u2019t require that the companies provide data about wages.\n\u201cThese are the crux of what makes a union strong and the very, very bottom line of what members need and want,\u201d Dubal said. \u201cThat they couldn\u2019t achieve those things \u2014 that\u2019s a win for Uber.\u201d\nUber driver Margarita Pe\u00f1alosa, 45, of Los Angeles, said she realized she needed a union after being temporarily deactivated from the app, and losing three days of income, when a passenger who reeked of marijuana left behind a lingering smell in her car that other riders then complained about.\n\u201cThat experience made me realize how powerless we can be,\u201d she said. She said she hoped that a collective bargaining process would create a \u201cclear, fair appeals process\u201d for rider complaints.\nA Southern California group that counts some 20,000 drivers as members said they had lobbied for provisions to strengthen the bill \u2014 including protections that would give drivers the right to strike and more enforcement resources for the state board tasked with overseeing the process \u2014 but had been largely shut out of negotiations.\n\u201cWe were not invited into conversations about this, and we were banging on the door,\u201d said Nicole Moore, president of Rideshare Drivers United.\nRepresentatives from SEIU and Wicks\u2019 office met multiple times with Rideshare Drivers United about their proposals and discussed why some weren\u2019t included, said someone familiar with the negotiations who was not authorized to speak publicly. For example, that person said, strike protections could open up the bill to attack for potentially violating antitrust laws.\n\u201cWhile we always give fair consideration to suggested amendments, not all are ultimately viable,\u201d Wicks said. She added that her office heard from dozens of constituents and advocates over months of public debate, and \u201cany suggestion otherwise is disingenuous.\u201d\nDespite the weaknesses in the law, Moore said, she still hopes that it will help, since right now, she said, drivers \u201chave no labor rights and our wages are in the dungeon.\u201d\n\u201cWe will do what we can with duct tape and a few paper clips and a little extra wax to actually wage a fight,\u201d she said.\nThe insurance bill, backed by Uber and Lyft and introduced by state Sen. Christopher Cabaldon (D-Yolo), would reduce the amount of insurance that companies like Uber and Lyft are required to provide for rides.\nCurrently, the companies must carry $1 million in coverage per rideshare driver for accidents caused by other drivers who are uninsured or underinsured. The companies have argued that current insurance requirements are so high that they encourage litigation for insurance payouts and create higher costs for passengers.\nThe agreement instead calls for $60,000 in uninsured motorist coverage per rideshare driver and $300,000 per accident.\nCabaldon said that the changes would eliminate \u201coutsized insurance requirements that don\u2019t apply to any other forms of transportation, such as taxis, buses, or limos.\u201d"

      "text": "UCLA Unlocked: Ten Bruins who must step up for the football team to thrive in \u201925\n- Share via\nGreg Biggins, the 247Sports.com college football recruiting analyst who is one of the best in the nation at what he does, likes to say that you need dudes to win big.\nNo one has won a national championship in the College Football Playoff era whose roster wasn\u2019t at least halfway stocked with four- and five-star players. Only a handful of teams have made the title game without meeting that blue-chip ratio \u2014 and they\u2019ve been walloped.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve got to have dudes, you have to have talent,\u201d Biggins recently told The Times. \u201cCoaching and development is huge, but you take coaching and development with guys who look like [star Ohio State wide receiver] Jeremiah Smith, now that\u2019s a different level altogether.\u201d\nAs UCLA\u2019s DeShaun Foster prepares to open his second season as the head coach at his alma mater, he\u2019s increasingly replenished his roster with dudes. Transfer quarterback Nico Iamaleava is a five-star talent, and 13 other players who arrived through the transfer portal were rated as four stars either coming out of high school or as a transfer.\nWhile the Bruins\u2019 blue-chip ratio still falls well short of 50%, it\u2019s creeping upward. But as Biggins mentioned, coaching and development also matter. Former UCLA linebacker Carson Schwesinger, who received zero stars coming out of high school, is now with the Cleveland Browns after being selected in the second round of the NFL draft.\nFor the Bruins to have the breakthrough they\u2019re seeking under Foster, they will need both blue-chippers and less heralded prospects to emerge as stars. Here are 10 players who must become dudes for UCLA to succeed in 2025:\nOffense\nQB Nico Iamaleava: Well, duh. UCLA is not going to have the kind of season it wants unless its quarterback puts himself in the conversation for the school\u2019s best player at the position since Brett Hundley. (Sorry, Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Josh Rosen, eight- and nine-win seasons don\u2019t suffice.) Efficiency will tell the story. If Iamaleava exceeds his 2024 accuracy, when he completed 63.8% of his passes and tallied nearly four times as many touchdowns (19) as interceptions (five), then the Bruins will be in business.\nOT Courtland Ford: Quickly slotting into the starting left tackle spot in spring practices, Ford projects to have his biggest role since he started the first eight games of the 2021 season at USC. He went on to become a part-time starter with the Trojans in 2022 and at Kentucky in 2023 and 2024 before transferring to UCLA. The hope is that he can provide stability and bolster an offensive line that was a major weakness last season amid several injuries at left tackle.\nRB Jaivian Thomas: Jaydn who? Foster likes to point out that Thomas was the top tailback at California last season despite Jaydn Ott receiving much of the hype. There\u2019s a widespread expectation that Thomas will reprise that role with the Bruins as part of a deep group of running backs that also includes Jalen Berger, Anthony Woods, Anthony Frias II and Karson Cox. While each of those players holds promise, Thomas appears to have the biggest upside given his speed, patience and vision.\nWR Kwazi Gilmer: Often by Iamaleava\u2019s side getting off the team bus at training camp, Gilmer quickly established a narrative of becoming his quarterback\u2019s go-to receiver. The duo established a strong connection during the short practice viewing window open to the media, Iamaleava often finding the speedy and shifty Gilmer in the end zone. It\u2019s easy to envision Gilmer more than doubling his output from 2024, when he caught 31 passes for 345 yards and two touchdowns. Gilmer showed some swagger by saying he wanted to win the Biletnikoff Award that goes to the nation\u2019s top college receiver; now he\u2019s got to back up those words.\nTE Hudson Habermehl: After shedding his surfer look, those long blond locks replaced by a far more streamlined hairstyle, Hambermehl yearns to reintroduce himself as a sleeker, more productive version of the player Bruins fans last saw in the spring of 2024. That\u2019s when he suffered a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury that would require two surgeries and more than a year of recovery. Now Habermehl is back, ready to become the team\u2019s most targeted tight end while exceeding his 2023 production (nine catches for 148 yards and three touchdowns).\nDefense\nLB JonJon Vaughns: Having abandoned his baseball pursuits for football full time, Vaughns needs to slide into a starring role. He\u2019s shown glimpses of promise, particularly during a 2022 season in which he started 11 games and made two interceptions and five pass breakups. Now comes the challenge of sustaining that sort of production while leading a defense that thirsts for new playmakers to emerge at every position.\nS Key Lawrence: Perhaps the most energetic player on the team, the Mississippi transfer also boasts plenty of talent thanks to his combination of speed and smarts. Barring a setback from the minor right leg injury he sustained midway through training camp, Lawrence projects to be an opening-day starter. He\u2019ll need to anchor a secondary that\u2019s replacing every starter.\nEdge Devin Aupiu: UCLA\u2019s pass rush was meh last season, generating 22 sacks to rank tied for No. 78 in the nation. As a part-time starter, Aupiu made 4\u00bd tackles for loss, including 1\u00bd sacks \u2014 decent production given his role and easily the most among returning players. Getting into the backfield more often this season is a must for the redshirt senior.\nDT Gary Smith III: Most successful diets don\u2019t end with someone weighing 340 pounds. But after shedding 20 pounds thanks to what he described as clean eating, Smith appears slimmer, stronger and more explosive in his return from the ankle injury that sidelined him all of last season. He posted a video of his squatting a team-high 700 pounds and could combine with fellow interior defensive lineman Keanu Williams to make running up the middle the place where ambitions go to die for opposing tailbacks.\nLB Isaiah Chisom: In case Chisom was tempted to get cocky after one season at Oregon State in which he was selected a freshman All-American by The Athletic, he lost out to new UCLA teammate Jalen Woods in the battle to keep his No. 9 jersey. Maybe every time he glances at his No. 32, it will remind him of the work he needs to put in to become a super sophomore.\nOlympic sport spotlight: Men\u2019s soccer\nThe program that produced Sigi Schmid, Cobi Jones and Paul Caligiuri hasn\u2019t been in the news much lately.\nUCLA men\u2019s soccer has not made it past the Round of 16 in the NCAA tournament since reaching the finals in 2014, when it lost to Virginia. The Briuns\u2019 last national championship came in 2002.\nCould 2025 be a breakthrough year?\nAnswers will start to emerge once the Bruins open the season Thursday evening at UC Irvine. UCLA returns four starters, including junior midfielder Philip Naef, who led the team last season with 10 assists \u2014 the most since Jackson Yueill also reached double digits in 2016. A bevy of talented freshmen from the nation\u2019s top-ranked recruiting class, according to TopDrawerSoccer, should also help coach Ryan Jorden\u2019s bid to guide his team deep into the NCAA tournament.\nAlumni watch\nCarson Schwesinger\u2019s incredible ascent continues.\nThe linebacker who was essentially unwanted out of Oaks Christian High when UCLA snagged him with a walk-on spot impressed in his NFL preseason debut, leading the Cleveland Browns with six tackles during a 30-10 exhibition victory over the Carolina Panthers.\nMaking that production all the more impressive, it came in only 13 snaps. Maybe that transition from college to the NFL isn\u2019t so hard after all.\n\u201cI mean, I think there\u2019s always going to be a difference going to the next level,\u201d Schwesinger told reporters after the game, \u201cbut we\u2019ve been practicing against it so much now that it\u2019s something that I\u2019m getting used to. So there wasn\u2019t a huge difference, I would say, from practice to the game. I think that\u2019s because of how we practice.\u201d\nRemember when?\nMy favorite UCLA-Utah game felt like one played in an alternate universe.\nThe Bruins, who ran what could have been called the \u201cPoint-Three Yards and a Cloud of Dust\u201d offense under Kennedy Polamalu in 2016, came out in a spread, no-huddle, hurry-up formation against the Utes for the first time all season.\nIt might have resulted in a UCLA victory had the Bruins\u2019 defense showed up.\nUtah running back Joe Williams ran for a school-record 332 yards and four touchdowns during the Utes\u2019 thrilling 52-45 victory, overcoming a record-setting day for UCLA quarterback Mike Fafaul. Continuing to start in place of the injured Josh Rosen, Fafaul completed 40 of 70 passes for a career-high 464 yards and five touchdowns while breaking Rosen\u2019s previous school records for completions (34) and pass attempts (57).\nIn a lost season for the Bruins, this was as entertaining as it got.\nYou can watch highlights from that game here.\nPoll results\nWe asked, \u201cWhich UCLA football player not named Nico Iamaleava will be the team\u2019s most important in 2025?\u201d and gave you five choices: offensive tackle Courtland Ford, running back Jaivian Thomas, wide receiver Kwazi Gilmer, defensive tackle Gary Smith III or linebacker Isaiah Chisom.\nAfter 534 votes, the results:\nRunning back Jaivian Thomas, 37.4%\nWide receiver Kwazi Gilmer, 23.7%\nOffensive tackle Courtland Ford, 17.6%\nDefensive tackle Gary Smith III, 17.4%\nLinebacker Isaiah Chisom, 3.9%\nOpinion time\nUCLA\u2019s 2025 football schedule features a handful of games that scream intrigue.\nThe opener against Utah is a battle of former Pac-12 rivals.

      "text": "- Share via\n- Tyler Wells lost his home \u2014 and almost his restaurant \u2014 in Altadena in the January fires.\n- After months of soul searching, he\u2019s reopening the restaurant as a beacon for the community.\n- On Saturday Bernee returns as Betsy with its custom hearth grill and a renewed focus on farm sourcing.\nAgainst all odds, Tyler Wells\u2019 Altadena restaurant remains standing. Like roughly 10,000 homes and structures in the area, many of the surrounding businesses burned in January\u2019s Eaton fire, changing the mountain town\u2019s community and landscape forever.\nAfter the neighborhood\u2019s destruction Wells thought his restaurant would never reopen, but on Saturday, Betsy \u2014 formerly called Bernee \u2014 will serve its rustic, seasonal cuisine once again. It will usher in customers for the return of its hearth-fired menu in what Wells hopes will be a beacon of light and a gathering place for Altadena after so much pain.\nIn a town where so much has disappeared, a new place to grieve has emerged in an Altadena parking lot.\nBetsy \u2014 near the corner of Lake Avenue and Mariposa Street \u2014 is flanked by remnants of the fire\u2019s destruction: to the west, a hollowed-out brick structure that once held the local hardware store, its metal light fixtures still wilted from the heat; to the south, a leveled lot that was once a Spanish-language school; and north, there\u2019s what\u2019s left of a pottery studio and neighborhood stalwarts Caf\u00e9 de Leche and Rancho Bar.\n\u201cFire\u2019s an incredible thing, and also will decimate an entire city and ruin people\u2019s lives,\u201d Wells said. \u201cThe allure of it for me is to not control it \u2014 and this is getting spiritual \u2014 but to find that harmony. Maybe we can do our tiniest little part to restore some of that balance.\u201d\nBernee debuted Dec. 7, 2024. In its one month of service before the fire, guests dined on steaks, cast-iron potatoes and rich, fluffy burnt cheesecakes in the glow of its wood-fired hearth. The oven, overseen by lead chef Paul Downer, burned through almond wood and red oak, required near-\u2019round-the-clock staff, and functioned as a baking oven by day and a blazing grill and roasting oven for meat, fish, beans and charred vegetables by night.\nWells had poured himself into the space, building his own tables, shelves and sleek wooden walls. Through personal duress, including the dissolution of his marriage to Ashley Wells and of their partnership in popular Los Feliz restaurant All Time, he found hope and focus in his new Altadena restaurant.\nOn Jan. 2 he moved to a new home, nearer to what is now Betsy, which is named for his late mother. On the day of the Eaton fire he told his therapist, \u201cI don\u2019t know, man, I could see myself being happy here. There\u2019s a little crack with light being shown in.\u201d He had a morning of revelation and optimism. That night, located practically along the Eaton Canyon trail, his new house was directly in the fire\u2019s path.\nWells never imagined the fire would reach the city. On Jan. 7 he worked the restaurant til close, and helped his staff leave early and chart safer routes back to their homes.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018The restaurant\u2019s fine, you guys get home safe,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cLike, this restaurant is so far from the mountain, a fire can\u2019t burn through all of this. Little did I know about these grapefruit-sized embers getting blasted down the mountain.\u201d\nThat night he evacuated a few of his own belongings. Then he woke up to roughly 150 text messages, many simply sharing statements like, \u201cIt\u2019s all gone.\u201d\n\u201cI was just like, \u2018OK, the restaurant\u2019s gone. My house is gone. I\u2019m separated. I just had this moment: \u2018I\u2019m out. I\u2019m leaving now,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was just like, \u2018I\u2019m not coming back to L.A. This is it.\u2019\u201d\nHe began to envision starting over anew, maybe in another state, maybe in Mexico. Not two hours later, Paola Guasp \u2014 owner of Amara Kitchen, which also burned \u2014 reached out: Wells\u2019 restaurant was, somehow, still standing.\nBefore the Eaton fire, Altadena and north Pasadena had seen a new generation start new restaurants and food shops and revive old ones. Many of those small businesses were destroyed in the flames. But not everything is gone. There is hope for rebuilding not just structures but a community.\nHe drove to Mariposa Street to check on Bernee and happened to meet one of his staff, who\u2019d also decided to visit the restaurant at that moment. They embraced, then Wells grabbed two cases of the most expensive wine in the building and drove north without a destination.\nWells had befriended potter Victoria Morris and her husband, Morgan Bateman, occasionally dropping by the ceramics studio housed in the building behind Bernee. It burned in January. So did their home.\nAs Wells drove north he called an Ojai hotel and booked a few nights there, then called Morris and Bateman, who have a home in Ojai. Morris told him to cancel his hotel. \u201cI was like, \u2018What? What do you mean?\u2019\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd there was a long pause, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Tyler, f\u2014 you. You live with us now.\u2019\u201d\nFor eight weeks they processed the fire and their losses and grief. Those meals and months with them, he said, are moments he\u2019ll cherish for the rest of his life.\nHe then traveled to Mexico City to visit friends, and his return to California, he vowed, would only be a temporary one.\nA call from the Ecology Center, a sprawling farm and market stand in San Juan Capistrano, changed his course. Could he help reshape the onsite cafe, molding its menus and programming closer to the farm\u2019s bounty? No, he thought, he wasn\u2019t ready. Wells traveled to Colorado, but he couldn\u2019t get the Ecology Center out of his mind; he cut his trip short and headed back, throwing himself into work on the farm, its cafe and ticketed dinners and events. Then he called in Bernee reinforcements.\nJoey Messina, a cook at Betsy, agreed to temporarily relocate to the farm. Wells vacated the Airstream trailer on the property for him, and took up new residency on the property\u2019s yurt. When they needed waitstaff help they called Tom Oakes, also currently at Betsy; he trekked down to join them and Wells relocated again, this time pitching a tent between two orange trees. He remained there for eight weeks. More staff followed.\nThey called it \u201cdirtbag summer camp,\u201d working 18 hours a day, then cooking luxurious meals with produce pulled right from the ground. These dinners convinced him to stay.\n\u201cL.A.\u2019s got some challenges that are really hard for me as a business owner, but these are my people,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the greatest friends I\u2019ve ever known in my life. \u2026 It\u2019s hot and it\u2019s expensive and it\u2019s a pain in the ass to do business here, but the greatest people in the world are here.\u201d\nAfter its closure, most of Bernee\u2019s staff found work in other restaurants. Some, like server Courtney Johnson \u2014 the new curator of Betsy\u2019s wine list \u2014 told The Times that they were ready to leave the industry entirely, unless Wells reopened his restaurant.\n\u201cThey made the decision that the restaurant\u2019s reopening,\u201d Wells said. \u201cI had to just pull a few levers here and there, like, \u2018Here\u2019s your restaurant back.\u2019 I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nThe timing, he said, also began to feel right. The first months were horrifying, filled with trauma and smoke. In spring when construction crews began clearing the lots, he felt slightly optimistic. Through the summer, grass began to grow. The air felt cleaner. He saw signs of life returning to the community.\n\u201cI just realized: We\u2019re right at the bottom of this climb, and it\u2019s a hell of a climb, and I want to be a part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where I fit in.\u201d\nWhat kind of a member of this community would he be, he thought, if he only returned once all the damage had cleared?\nWhile some fire victims are opting to sell their lots in Altadena, one woman is choosing to stay and rebuild \u2014 and she\u2019s trying to do it as quickly as possible.\nHe renamed the restaurant and tweaked the menu for seasonality, but nearly everything remains as it did during Bernee\u2019s single month of service. He\u2019s gotten that wood-fired hearth back up and running. He deep-cleaned the air ducts and filters and restocked its kitchen.\nOn Aug. 3 he threw his first dinner at Betsy, cooking for friends, family, neighbors, and guests who\u2019d cut their dinner short on the night the fire began in January. Wells gave the staff a pre-opening speech that was so unexpectedly emotional it brought him to tears in front of them all.\n\u201cI was just like, \u2018This restaurant is not a restaurant,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a silly thing, but what it represents is something so much bigger and deeper, and what it means for people in the community.\u201d\nOn Aug. 24, during another practice run of dinner service, a customer approached Wells in the dining room and tapped him gently on the shoulder from behind.\nHe didn\u2019t know her, she said softly over the din of the guests, but she lives in the neighborhood. She said she needed to tell him that the return of the restaurant felt like the start of something new for Altadena, and she was so glad it came back.\n\u201cI think people do see it as a beacon, just to let a little bit of light in,\u201d Wells said later. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be just us, obviously \u2014 I think we need another 1,000 examples of that \u2014 but it\u2019s so meaningful to me. That\u2019s what restaurants have always been for me, but to be able to do it in this kind of time and place is really powerful. It feels like a calling for all of us.\u201d\nBetsy is at 875 E. Mariposa St. in Altadena, open daily from 5 p.m. until close."

      "text": "Can DeShaun Foster continue to grow? Five things to watch when UCLA faces Utah\n- Share via\nA year ago, UCLA was on the verge of Hawaiian humiliation in its season opener.\nThe offense plodded. The defense was a blooper reel, committing three penalties on the same play. The special teams failed to put enough players on the field, leading to a busted punt coverage.\nShakiest of all might have been the coach.\nHaving starred as a running back and assistant coach, DeShaun Foster stumbled in his head-coaching debut. Appearing as disorganized and unprepared as his team, Foster didn\u2019t know the proper way to address reporters after his team rallied to beat Hawaii, asking a media relations staff member for help.\nAfter a brief run at Tennessee, Nico Iamaleava is grateful to be surrounded by family and focused on leading the UCLA football team to success.\nYeah, you could say he was a mess.\nA year later, on the verge of his second season, Foster acknowledged as much.\n\u201cOh, I was scared, you know?\u201d Foster said this week. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never been scared on the football field. It was a nervous feeling just because it was brand new and I\u2019d never been in that position.\u201d\nAnd now?\n\u201cI\u2019m not nowhere near where we were last year,\u201d Foster said, \u201cso I feel pretty good.\u201d\nThe coach and his team will need to be at their best Saturday night at the Rose Bowl when they open the season against Utah, a trendy pick to become a College Football Playoff contender.\nUCLA\u2019s roster features 57 new players \u2014 including two who arrived after the start of training camp \u2014 and eight new assistant coaches, including offensive coordinator Tino Sunseri.\nHow will Foster fare in this second chance to make a first impression after his team went 5-7 in 2024? Here are five things to watch when the Bruins face the Utes:\nThe Nico Show?\nQuarterback Nico Iamaleava\u2019s arrival as a former five-star high school prospect who helped Tennessee reach the CFP in 2024 generated some much-needed buzz for a humdrum operation.\nNational college football reporters swarmed Iamaleava at Big Ten media days. His presence has kept UCLA in the headlines for several months.\nBut Foster wanted everyone to know that UCLA football is not a one-man show.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more than just Nico on our team,\u201d Foster said, \u201cso I think all our guys are pretty excited to get out there and show a national audience what we can do.\u201d\nOther candidates to emerge as stars include wide receiver Kwazi Gilmer, running back Jaivian Thomas, defensive tackle Gary Smith III and safety Key Lawrence.\nTino\u2019s debut\nA stirring subplot Saturday will be UCLA\u2019s new offensive coordinator.\nOnce considered a rising star as quarterbacks coach and co-offensive coordinator, Sunseri now gets to run his own offense. What will it look like?\nPredictably keeping things as vague as possible to protect his scheme, Sunseri said it would be balanced and physical while stretching the defense to make it cover \u201cevery blade of grass.\u201d\nIt could also mix in some fun. Spotted at a recent practice were giant poster boards featuring symbols, logos and faces. The boards were similar to what Oregon used under coach Chip Kelly before his UCLA teams became a lot less entertaining.\nMaking a run for it\nFoster called this the deepest group of running backs he\u2019s had at UCLA.\nThomas and Jalen Berger are the favorites to get the most carries, followed by Anthony Woods and Anthony Frias II. Woods will be playing against his old team after sitting out last season at Utah while recovering from a torn knee ligament. He had been electric before that at Idaho, leading the Big Sky Conference in 2023 with 1,155 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns.\nThomas has the potential to top 1,000 yards this season and Berger is eager to show his potential after being hobbled by an ankle injury over the final four games of last season.\nAn early test\nUCLA\u2019s defense won\u2019t be able to ease its way into the season.\nIt will face a Utah offensive line that includes five returning starters and a pair of tackles \u2014 Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu \u2014 who are projected first-round NFL draft picks.\nThe question is how productive transfer quarterback Devon Dampier can be playing behind that line. Dampier had more success running the ball (1,166 yards and 7.5 yards per carry with 19 touchdowns) than he did passing (57.9% accuracy with as many interceptions as touchdowns) last season at New Mexico. Offensive coordinator Jason Beck came over with Dampier from Albuquerque, which could ease their transition.\nThe names to know in Utah\u2019s run game are Wayshawn Parker, a transfer from Washington State, and NaQuari Rogers, a transfer from New Mexico. Beck\u2019s offense is expected to spread the field with an up-tempo attack, amplifying the challenge facing the Bruins.\nStepping up\nThe search for playmakers on a defense replacing every full-time starter begins up front.\nSmith and fellow defensive tackle Keanu Williams are both coming off significant injuries but could provide an immediate roadblock for opposing run games if they can return to form.\nIn addition to his veteran interior defensive linemen, Foster also identified defensive tackle Siale Taupaki, edge rushers Anthony Jones and Kechaun Bennett and linebackers Scott Taylor and JuJu Walls as the most consistent pass rushers in training camp."

      "text": "UCLA Unlocked: Game-by-game picks for how Bruins football will fare in 2025\n- Share via\nAn optimist can see and hear it, like a dramatic score accompanying the path to some inconceivable dreamland.\nLate in the season, the wins piling up and the buzz building inside the Rose Bowl, UCLA finds itself in contention for the College Football Playoff.\nNew quarterback Nico Iamaleava elevates everyone around him. New offensive coordinator Tino Sunseri is the envy of every other college football staff. The defense finds more than enough playmakers. Athletic director Martin Jarmond must fight the urge to take a victory lap over his hiring of coach DeShaun Foster.\nOf course, there are other views on how things might go for the Bruins in 2025.\nA pessimist can envision a comedic unraveling. Iamaleava is erratic playing behind an offensive line that struggles to protect him. Sunseri\u2019s offense can\u2019t sustain momentum. The defense gets pushed around.\nA realist can see a mix of the possibilities. Iamaleava has several savior moments in leading the Bruins to big wins, but the team\u2019s shortcomings keep it from reaching a truly elite level.\nWhat\u2019s my take? Preferring to keep it real, there\u2019s probably a sprinkling of each scenario in store for UCLA during what\u2019s probably Iamaleava\u2019s only season as a Bruin. Here\u2019s my game-by-game prediction for how things will go this season:\nUtah on Saturday at the Rose Bowl: This could come down to which team has the better transfer quarterback. Utah\u2019s Devon Dampier, a dual-threat dynamo in his first season with the team after arriving from New Mexico alongside new Utes offensive coordinator Jason Beck, will challenge a UCLA defense effectively replacing every starter. Here\u2019s saying that the Bruins\u2019 \u201cD\u201d gets it done with a big assist from Iamaleava, whose sparkling debut as UCLA\u2019s quarterback provides a little wiggle room. (Win, Record: 1-0)\nNevada Las Vegas on Sept. 6 at Allegiant Stadium: Four years after his Florida flameout, Dan Mullen is trying to revive his career at what\u2019s traditionally been a coaches\u2019 graveyard. Barry Odom bucked that trend when he won 20 games over the last two seasons, parlaying that success into the Purdue job. Mullen restocked a barren roster with a bevy of Power Four conference transfers, including quarterbacks Alex Orji (Michigan) and Anthony Colandrea (Virginia). But the bottom line is that the Bruins should still have more talent. (Win, Record: 2-0)\nNew Mexico on Sept. 12 at the Rose Bowl: This plucky Mountain West Conference outfit has a new coach in Jason Eck, who went an impressive 26-13 in three seasons at Idaho. Winning with the Lobos will be harder, particularly with an almost entirely new offense. New Mexico brought in Scottre Humphrey and Damon Bankston, running backs who each topped 1,000 yards at the Football Championship Subdivision level. Beating UCLA away from Albuquerque will take a freaky Friday for an undermanned roster seeking something close to a miracle. Better call Saul? (Win, Record: 3-0)\nNorthwestern on Sept. 27 at Martin Stadium: Weird things happen in a football season. UCLA will probably be riding high and favored in its Big Ten opener against a team that somehow assembled a worse offense than the Bruins\u2019 under Eric Bieniemy in 2024. But odds and assumptions are far from foolproof. Northwestern has a prolific quarterback in Preston Stone, a transfer from Southern Methodist, and a sturdy running back in Cam Porter, who will be back for a sixth season, to go with a stellar defensive line. For UCLA, this could be the ache by the lake. (Loss, Record: 3-1)\nPenn State on Oct. 4 at the Rose Bowl: James Franklin is known for stumbling in big games, and this could qualify if the Bruins start 4-0 and Iamaleava builds significant Heisman Trophy buzz. Chances are the Nittany Lions have enough talent in 2025 to overcome any shaky decisions from the sideline. Veteran quarterback Drew Allar, a backfield featuring a pair of 1,000-yard rushers and a defense with a slew of players bound for the NFL will probably make this a one-sided affair. (Loss, Record: 3-2)\nMichigan State on Oct. 11 at Spartan Stadium: There are plenty of parallels between Foster and Jonathan Smith, coaches with plenty to prove in their second season with their respective teams. Smith\u2019s prospects for a Year 2 breakthrough don\u2019t seem as promising unless quarterback Aidan Chiles can become far more efficient than he was in 2024, when he completed just 59.4% of his passes and tallied 11 interceptions, tied for the most in the Big Ten. Here\u2019s guessing the Spartans come away from this game with quarterback envy. (Win, Record: 4-2)\nMaryland on Oct. 18 at the Rose Bowl: God bless Mike Locksley. At a time when it seems that no one wants to take accountability, Maryland\u2019s coach admitted he had lost his locker room last season over animosity regarding who made what in name, image and likeness compensation. It turned out that no one was worth much considering the team finished 4-8. Among the newcomers this season is UCLA transfer Justyn Martin, who will be determined to beat his old team if he wins the starting quarterback job. (Win, Record: 5-2)\nIndiana on Oct. 25 at Memorial Stadium: Rather than sneak up on anyone, the Hoosiers could just outright bludgeon them. That\u2019s how much talent coach Curt Cignetti has amassed going into his second season after making Indiana the breakthrough story of 2024. Fernando Mendoza, the transfer quarterback from California, is poised to pick up where predecessor Kurtis Rourke left off, setting offensive records and making opposing defenses look overmatched. (Loss, Record: 5-3)\nNebraska on Nov. 8 at the Rose Bowl: UCLA\u2019s defense made Dylan Raiola look like a Division III quarterback last season, constantly pressuring the freshman into shaky passes and bad decisions. Adding high-end transfers on the offensive line in guard Rocco Spindler (Notre Dame) and tackle Elijah Pritchett (Alabama) should help Raiola elevate his game. The big question surrounds the Cornhuskers defense following the departure of defensive coordinator Tony White to Florida State; can his replacement, John Butler, sustain the team\u2019s success on that side of the ball? (Win, Record: 6-3)\nOhio State on Nov. 15 at Ohio Stadium: UCLA fans who were looking forward to heckling Chip Kelly from the stands lost the opportunity once the failed-Bruin-turned-successful-Buckeye headed to Las Vegas to join Pete Carroll\u2019s staff with the Raiders. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is a stocked Ohio State roster led by star wide receiver Jeremiah Smith that features All-Big Ten candidates at every position. The Bruins would do well to keep this game close at halftime. (Loss, Record: 6-4)\nWashington on Nov. 22 at the Rose Bowl: Former UCLA offensive coordinator Jedd Fisch has been a thorn in the Bruins\u2019 side recently, guiding Arizona to wins over UCLA in 2022 and 2023 before beating the Bruins during his debut season at Washington in 2024. Huskies quarterback Demond Williams Jr., making just his second career start, looked like a future star after throwing for 374 yards and four touchdowns against Louisville in the Sun Bowl. Fisch also restocked the defense with playmakers from the transfer portal. Seeking an important late-season win to boost their bowl standing, the Bruins might have to \u201cGo Fisch.\u201d (Loss, Record: 6-5)\nUSC on Nov. 29 at the Coliseum: In a rivalry oddity, the home team has lost every game since the Trojans routed the Bruins at the Coliseum in 2019. Lincoln Riley seeks some stability going into his fourth season after a sparkling debut was followed by two years of maddening mediocrity, but he\u2019ll need far more consistency out of quarterback Jayden Maiava to come anywhere close to the CFP. Here\u2019s betting that Iamaleava is the best quarterback on the field and the Bruins revive calls for Riley\u2019s dismissal with more rivalry road revelry. (Win, Record: 7-5)\nLas Vegas Bowl vs. Washington State on Dec. 31 at Allegiant Stadium: The Bruins take on an old Pac-12 rival that bears no resemblance to recent predecessors. The Cougars are expected to unleash a relentless rushing attack after hiring coach Jimmy Rogers from South Dakota State and importing tailbacks Angel Johnson and Kirby Vorhees, who combined for more than 1,100 yards on the ground last season at the FCS level under Rogers. This could be UCLA backup quarterback Luke Duncan\u2019s big moment with Iamaleava probably sitting out in preparation for the NFL draft. (Win, Record: 8-5)\nIt\u2019s gotta be the shoes \u2026 and suits\nYou might see the football team walk into the Rose Bowl on Saturday in snazzy light blue suits and tan laser wingtip Oxfords, wondering how much all that haberdashery cost.\nWe have some answers.\nLast year, when Foster outfitted players in suits with custom lining, a wrinkle-resistant shirt and tie \u2014 including the same jackets that marketing officials said players wore for the CFP national championship game \u2014 the tab was $65,625, according to documents provided from a public-records request. That accounted for 125 suits at $525 each, with defensive tackle Jay Toia\u2019s custom suit in a different fabric going for an additional $400.\nThe 174 pairs of Cole Haan dress shoes the team ordered cost $72 each \u2014 a bargain, considering they were recently on sale for $139.95 online \u2014 for a total of $12,528.\nOffensive tackle Garrett DiGiorgio said at Big Ten media day that returning players would re-wear their suits from last season, though with 55 newcomers on the roster, there will be plenty of new fabric unveiled Saturday.\nHeard on campus\nUCLA basketball coach Mick Cronin has three more seasons left on the contract extension he signed on the eve of the 2022 NCAA tournament, but it appears that he\u2019ll probably have the option to put pen to paper once more to secure an even longer future with the Bruins.\nDuring a recent conversation with The Times, Jarmond indicated his satisfaction with Cronin and his hopes to hold onto the coach who has taken the school to one Final Four and two Sweet 16s.\n\u201cI want Mick to be here a long time \u2014 Mick knows that,\u201d Jarmond said. \u201cWe talk about that, so you know, we\u2019ll work on that when we need to work on it. But I want him to be here a long time. I love what Mick is doing in our program.\u201d\nOlympic sport spotlight: Men\u2019s water polo\nAdam Wright deserves a statue on campus.\nNot only has the UCLA men\u2019s water polo coach won five national titles, he\u2019s won all of them against rival USC, maximizing the glory.\nThe Bruins enter this season with designs on a repeat after winning their 13th NCAA championship behind the incredible play of freshman Ryder Dodd, who scored 102 goals on the way to becoming the first player to win both Mountain Pacific Sports Federation player and newcomer of the year in the same season.\nSix of the top seven scorers return for a team that opens the season Friday against Navy at Coronado High.\nOpinion time\nMany college football pundits have fawned over Iamaleava before he\u2019s thrown a single pass for the Bruins, signaling that he could lead his new team somewhere special. But there are certainly scenarios in which Iamaleava stars for a team that can\u2019t match his prowess.\nHow do you see the season playing out for UCLA and its new quarterback?\nIamaleava leads UCLA to the CFP\nIamaleava leads a resurgence to a bowl game\nIamaleava plays well but his team struggles\nIamaleava struggles for a losing team\nClick here to vote in our survey.\nPoll results\nWe asked, \u201cWhich UCLA football game are you looking forward to most?\u201d\nAfter 563 votes, the results:\nUtah on Aug. 30, 32.2%\nUSC on Nov. 29, 31.3%\nPenn St. on Oct. 4, 22.6%\nOhio St. on Nov. 15, 13.9%\nIn case you missed it\nRaised on football, Tino Sunseri intends to uphold heritage with UCLA\u2019s offense\nHow UCLA\u2019s new assistant football coaches ran an amazing race to hoard talent\nJudge\u2019s ruling effectively blocks two players from competing for USC and UCLA this season\nHave something Bruin?\nDo you have a comment or something you\u2019d like to see in a future UCLA newsletter?

      "text": "Santa Monica\u2019s police chief resigns, citing clash with city administration\n- Share via\n- Batista announced his resignation from a department in which he oversaw a drop in crime and increased police hiring.\n- He hinted at a clash with city leaders in his resignation letter.\nLess than four years into his tenure, Santa Monica\u2019s first Latino police chief, Ram\u00f3n Batista, has announced his resignation from the department where he oversaw a drop in crime and increased police hiring.\nBatista hinted at a potential clash with city leaders in a letter Friday to the city manager, Oliver Chi.\n\u201cMy nearly 40 years of experience in public safety and policing, my deeply held sense of justice, and following not only the spirit, but the letter of the law, appear to be at odds from demands set by the new administration,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cIn that light, the right path is to transition leadership here, as I look forward with purpose, conviction, and optimism to my next challenge.\u201d\nBatista said in his letter that his last day would be Oct. 4, exactly two weeks before his fourth anniversary of being sworn in as Santa Monica\u2019s 18th police chief over its 128 years.\nBatista and Santa Monica officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nChi, who received Batista\u2019s letter, said in a statement he was grateful for the chief\u2019s \u201cmany contributions.\u201d\n\u201cHis dedication, kindness and vision have shaped our police department in positive ways, and on behalf of the entire organization, we honor and thank him for his service,\u201d Chi said.\nEmployees at the Santa Monica Proper are pursuing a class-action lawsuit accusing the luxury hotel of failing to pay staff minimum wage.\nThe city manager also noted that Santa Monica Deputy Chief Darrick Jacob would serve as acting police chief.\nChi said Jacob had served the department for more than 20 years, with responsibilities including overseeing daily operations.\n\u201cI am supremely confident that our staff, the police department, and the entire community will be well served by Acting Chief Jacob,\u201d Chi said.\nChi did not lay out a process or a timeline for finding a permanent replacement.\nA call to the Santa Monica Police Officers Assn., which endorsed Batista\u2019s hiring, was not returned.\nBatista claims a few victories in his resignation letter, including helping rebuild morale after Santa Monica endured a chaotic protest in May 2020, when hundreds were arrested in the wake of the death of George Floyd.\nIn May 2021, an outside analyst hired by the city found several shortcomings in the department\u2019s reaction to the protest. Although no one died, OIR Group found that widespread \u201cvandalism and property damage, the losses to business and the divisive handling of protesters\u201d ultimately undermined the \u201cconfidence in people\u2019s basic security.\u201d\nOIR Group made 44 recommendations to the city, including addressing the department\u2019s high turnover rate and not relying on overtime as a fix for low staffing. The report also criticized a lack of planning in the lead-up to the protest.\nPolice arrested a man suspected of opening fire at Santa Monica Place mall. The man is also a person of interest in an incident where a suspect shot at a Waymo.\n\u201cDuring that period, morale was low, many officers were sidelined due to injuries, and the department was stretched thin,\u201d he wrote.\nBatista said in his letter that the department had 177 working police officers when he took over in October 2021. He said that number had been bumped up to 231.\nPart of what made Batista an attractive prospect for Santa Monica in the summer of 2021 was his ability to fight crime.\nBy the end of his 2\u00bd-year run as the police chief of Mesa, Ariz., his department had lowered Part I crimes to a city all-time low of 23 events per 1,000 residents.\nPart I crimes, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, refer to eight specific categories of serious offenses: criminal homicide (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter), rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.\nIn 2024, the department recorded 50,000 proactive contacts with residents and businesses while responding to 128,000 service calls, according to Batista.\nHe said his department made 2,800 arrests, which led to a 2% reduction in Part I crimes.\n\u201cI leave confident that the department is stronger, more modern, and more connected to the community than when I arrived,\u201d he said."

      "text": "Judge rules homeowner can probe State Farm claims practices\n- Share via\nPolicyholders critical of State Farm General\u2019s response to January\u2019s firestorms won a court victory this week when a judge ruled a Pacific Palisades homeowner can probe the insurer\u2019s claims handling practices during a rate hearing.\nIn doing so, Administrative Law Judge Karl Fredric Seligman denied a motion by the Department of Insurance to move an inquiry into the insurer\u2019s claims practices by Merritt Farren, whose home burned down, to a separate hearing after the rate increase is first considered.\n\u201cThe outcome could easily result in chaos and challenges ... on numerous grounds that would only operate to cause delay,\u201d the judge wrote of the department\u2019s motion in his Wednesday ruling.\nState Farm is seeking to raise its homeowner rates 11% after receiving an emergency 17% hike in May from Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, who adopted a decision by Seligman at the time that the insurer deserved the hike given its weak financial position even prior to the fires. State Farm also is seeking increases in other lines of property insurance.\nSix months after the Jan. 7 fire storms that killed at least 30 people, frustrations are mounting among many homeowners over how the state\u2019s largest insurer is handling their damage claims.\nThe insurer said this week it has received more than 13,000 claims and paid over $4.5 billion to policyholders. State Farm has said it expects claims payments to top $7 billion from the Jan. 7 fires, but losses under $700 million due to reinsurance agreements with its parent company. State Farm contends an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of its local policyholders are satisfied with its services.\nHowever, policyholders led by the Eaton Fire Survivors Network have demanded there should be no rate hike until hundreds of complaints over alleged payment delays, underpayments and claims denials are looked into and resolved \u2014 a position also voiced by area legislators at a news conference this week.\nAlso opposing the increase is Los Angeles advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, which says State Farm\u2019s possible total increase, including the 17% hike it already has received, would cost consumers $1.2 billion.\nFarren, 64, a former attorney for Disney and Amazon, was granted permission in July to participate in the rate hearing under a provision of Proposition 103, which regulates the industry and allows for public participation in rate hearings.\nHe said he was thankful for the judge\u2019s ruling this week, as well as a second decision that gave him time to seek documents from State Farm through the discovery process.\nState Farm, the largest home insurer in California, continues to seek approval of a 22% emergency rate hike even as it faces complaints over its handling of insurance claims.\nHe said any rate increases should be tied to the actual value homeowners receive from their policies, which crucially should include how their claims are handled. \u201cI think it\u2019s completely common sense and that it just really shouldn\u2019t be done any other way,\u201d Farren said.\nState Farm spokesperson Bob Devereux, in a statement said, \u201cWe thank the judge for the ruling on this matter, and we are looking forward to moving the rate hearing process forward toward conclusion later this year.\u201d\nThe Department of Insurance also said it looked forward to the rate hearing, which has been delayed and is now set for December.\nIn court filings, the department has argued that combining the two issues \u2014 the proposed rate increase and allegations the company has mishandled claims \u2014 could slow review of the rate request, which State Farm has said is critical to stabilize its finances.\nThe company\u2019s financial strength has been downgraded by ratings agencies, including S&P Global this month. However, the agency said it benefited from its strategic importance to its highly rated Bloomington, Ill., parent company.\nThe department also maintained that state law calls for handling claims issues through separate proceedings, including a market conduct exam of State Farm General\u2019s practices that Lara announced in June. It said a separate hearing would allow those findings when they are released to be considered with Farren\u2019s own probe of the issue.\nLegislators representing Altadena-area fire victims on Monday called on Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to crack down on insurers over how they are handling Jan. 7 fire claims and to freeze a rate hike requested by State Farm General.\nFarren said that while he lost his Mount Holyoke Drive home where he lived with this two sons, his request to look into claims practices wasn\u2019t driven by his personal experience with State Farm \u2014 which he deemed likely \u201cbetter than most\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but from what he heard from other policyholders.\nIn particular, he said he wants to look into the insurer\u2019s practices regarding payments for personal property losses and how it calculates building-cost estimates for reconstruction, as well as how it has handled claims for smoke-damaged houses. The insurer has been accused of being \u201cstingy\u201d in handling such claims.\nFarren said he has heard of situations in which State Farm has advanced payments for personal property coverage and then after receiving an itemized list of losses, has sought to offset what it has deemed overpayments from future payouts.\nMeanwhile, Palisades homeowners have received reconstruction cost estimates under $400 a square foot from State Farm, he alleged, when other insurers are issuing estimates of $800 to $1,200 per square foot.\nAfter the hearing, Joy Chen, chief executive of the Eaton Fire Survivors community group, issued an email to its more than 7,000 members, criticizing Lara for the department\u2019s legal position, saying Seligman had \u201csided with fairness.\u201d"

That address is part of the Hundred Acre property, Singer confirmed.\nSinger declined to comment on reports about the discarded ashes. However, he made clear that there was no controlled burn on the property that might have gotten out of control.\nAs of Sunday evening, the fire near Calistoga had scorched more than 6,800 acres and was 11% contained, fire officials said.\nOfficials with Cal Fire, which is leading the fire investigation and response, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Pickett fire remained at just under 7,000 acres as of Thursday, with 33% containment, according to Cal Fire reports. It broke out amid a major heat wave, prompting evacuation orders and warnings, including many that remain in place.\nThe blaze has not grown in several days, but Cal Fire reported Thursday that \u201clarge fuels continue to smolder within the fire perimeter as firefighters work to construct control lines within steep, rugged terrain.\u201d\nWhile the extent of damage to vineyards and properties around the region hasn\u2019t yet been assessed, no structures have been reported destroyed or damaged. Singer said Hundred Acre\u2019s properties have had road and infrastructure damage, but no buildings or vineyards were affected.\nThere are more than 2,500 people assigned to the fire response, according to Cal Fire."

      "text": "- Share via\nResidents in San Marino were stunned when a well-respected doctor and mother of twins was found dead in the scorched den of her sprawling estate.\nIrene Gaw-Lai and her husband, Yoon \u201cKevin\u201d Lai, had raised their sons in the affluent, quiet community, driving them to private school and baseball tournaments.\nBut when a fire burned in the rear of the family\u2019s home, family and neighbors wondered: How could a healthy 56-year-old be killed in a fire that never spread beyond a single room?\nBut her 16-year-old sons feared they knew the answer.\nReeling from the news of their mother\u2019s death, the boys spent that night with their aunt, saying they didn\u2019t want to be around their father, according to family court documents.\n\u201cThey were afraid,\u201d said Randolph Gaw, the dead woman\u2019s cousin and the attorney now representing Gaw-Lai\u2019s family.\nPublicly, investigators initially said little about Gaw-Lai\u2019s death. Investigators had not yet disclosed that she appeared to have been beaten, but her children were already harboring suspicions of their own.\nIn a court filing, family members said the two brothers \u201csuspect that Yoon had some involvement in the recent and untimely demise of their mother.\u201d\nNow, nearly six months after Gaw-Lai was found dead in her home in the 2600 block of Lorain Road, the Los Angeles County District Attorney has charged their father with one count each of murder and arson in an inhabited building.\nLai has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has been released on $2.25 million bail.\nFederal agents with the IRS, U.S. Postal Service, U.S. Labor Department and FBI were all part of the morning raid.\n\u201cWe look forward to defending these false allegations in Court,\u201d said Lai\u2019s attorney, James Robert Tedford, in an email. Tedford declined to comment on the accusations.\nFamily and neighbors said the family appeared to live a quiet life. Yet hundreds of court records reviewed by The Times, including sworn declarations, surveillance footage images and an autopsy report describe a strained marital relationship and contentious divorce.\nWhen firefighters found her corpse, Gaw-Lai had burns on about 60% of her body, according to a death investigation summary filed in court. Further investigation found that the mother had also suffered a broken nose, a fractured eye socket, a lost tooth, bruising to her knees and other parts of her body as well as multiple cuts and bruises. A frying pan and metal baseball bat with traces of blood on them were also found in the home, investigators wrote in the summary.\nAfter the fire, the twins\u2019 aunt was named temporary guardian. Lai has contested that order in court.\n\u201cShe has refused to return the children to me,\u201d the father wrote in a court filing.\nIn family court documents, Gaw-Lai\u2019s siblings described the couple\u2019s 22-year marriage as troubled and said that when the wife filed for divorce in August, she asked a judge to revoke the couple\u2019s premarital agreement. The divorce proceeding, according to court filings, meant the couple\u2019s real estate properties, believed to be worth millions of dollars by relatives, were suddenly at stake.\nAn endocrinologist, Gaw-Lai practiced in Arcadia. Lai, according to public records, owns his own civil engineering and land surveying business but also bought and sold real estate.\nThe two were married in 2002, but court records indicate their marriage quickly met challenges. Just months after they were married, Gaw-Lai filed for divorce, although they seemed to have reconciled by the time their twins were born in 2008.\nAt family gatherings, Lai would keep to himself unless the conversation turned toward business, Gaw said.\n\u201cAlmost every time he talked to me, it was almost always about money,\u201d Gaw said. \u201cEither how much people were making, how much he was paying in taxes or how much he didn\u2019t want to pay.\u201d\nA group of friends from Thousand Oaks were among the victims of a mass shooting in Reno this week. The men had attended another friend\u2019s bachelor party before the shooting.\nIn August 2024, Gaw-Lai filed for divorce again, citing irreconcilable differences. In court declarations, the couple\u2019s sons said they learned their father was having an affair after they looked at his phone.\nWhen asking for a divorce, Gaw-Lai also asked that their premarital agreement be nullified. According to Jocelyn Gaw\u2019s declaration, the request came because her sister had discovered that several properties the couple owned were solely in her husband\u2019s name and, according to the 2002 premarital agreement, would remain in his possession.\nRelatives said the couple talked about reconciliation, but Gaw-Lai had a few conditions before she reconsidered. According to text messages reviewed by The Times and filed in court, Gaw-Lai told her brother that Lai was \u201cbegging me to come back.\u201d\nSome of those conditions included voiding the premarital agreement, putting her name on all properties that had been purchased and requiring Lai to go to therapy.\n\u201cThat seems a lot, do you think he\u2019ll agree?\u201d her brother, Enrico Gaw Gonzalo, texted her.\n\u201cit depends on what\u2019s more important to him...\u201d she responded.\nThe premarital agreement was revoked on Sept. 7, 2024, and Gaw-Lai\u2019s name was also added as co-owner of the San Marino home, court records say.\nRelatives also told The Times that, despite her husband\u2019s acquiescence to her requests, Gaw-Lai still planned to go forward with the divorce. And as time went by, she told relatives she was increasingly concerned about her husband.\n\u201cIrene disclosed to others around this time that she was fearful for her safety if she was left alone with Kevin,\u201d one court filing reads.\nLai had moved out of the San Marino home but would stop by often to drive the twins to practice and events. Gaw-Lai would make sure the twins were around if her husband was stopping by, said Randolph Gaw.\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, Lai arrived at the Lorain Road home at 7:06 a.m. to take the twins to baseball practice, according to court documents. About six minutes later, Ring camera data submitted in court indicated sensors for the home\u2019s \u201cdining\u201d and \u201cgarden\u201d cameras \u2014 which pointed to where Gaw-Lai\u2019s body was found \u2014 were \u201cmanually disabled.\u201d\nAnd although Lai told his sons that he would be going to work after he dropped them off and would be picking them up late, Ring camera footage shows a car similar to Lai\u2019s returning to the neighborhood at 8:19 a.m., according to documents filed in court.\nAt 9:46 a.m., the couple\u2019s next-door neighbor, Connie Morris, called 911 when she saw smoking coming from the house, according to court documents.\nAccording to a declaration signed by Morris and submitted in court, she also spotted Lai inside the house. At one point, he opened the kitchen door to speak to her, acting \u201cbewildered\u201d when she mentioned the smoke.\nAccording to Morris\u2019 declaration, Lai said his wife was picking up the twins from baseball practice, but Morris noticed that her car was still at the house.\nIt took more than six months to confirm what officials hope will be the final death from L.A. County\u2019s January firestorm.\nGaw, the family\u2019s attorney, said cameras in the home didn\u2019t appear to capture video of what happened to Gaw-Lai.\nAccording to a death investigation summary of Gaw-Lai, the 56-year-old mother had suffered blunt force trauma to her head.\nInvestigators found the fire appeared to have started in the den, according to the report. One ignition point was near Gaw-Lai\u2019s body, and a second was about six feet away.\nMorris declined to talk about details of what she saw that day with a reporter but said she had lived next to the family for years.\nThe family led a quiet life, she said, and she can\u2019t remember ever hearing loud arguments or police being called to the house.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it was so alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just shocking.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nLatinos make up more than half of Oxnard\u2019s 202,000 residents, and they have long taken pride in helping to build this sprawling city by the sea.\nConstructed around the same agriculture fields where Cesar Chavez organized migrant laborers before establishing the United Farm Workers of America, Oxnard is a place where Latino influence is omnipresent \u2014 from music festivals to eateries.\nAt City Hall, officials have made it a priority to protect the area\u2019s immigrant residents and workforce \u2014 whether that involves bolstering tenant rights against predatory landlords, or joining a civil rights lawsuit against indiscriminate raids.\nBut a summer of immigration sweeps has fueled distrust in the community, and put city officials on the defensive.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s crackdown has sparked street protests, as well as complaints that city officials need to be more proactive and forceful in the face of federal immigration enforcement.\n\u201cTensions are high in the community right now and relations are being strained,\u201d said Lucas Zucker, co-executive director of Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, the same group behind new tenant protections. \u201cIt takes a lot of work to build trust with the immigrant community and any law enforcement or government.\u201d\nAt a City Council meeting last month, speakers criticized police and city leaders for not doing enough to help the immigrant population. Some called for legal action.\n\u201cOur community is under attack by the federal government,\u201d Veronica Miranda, 65, told the council that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you can do, but I\u2019m going to ask you to do something \u2014 a gesture, can we look at an eviction moratorium?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not able to stop the federal government,\u201d said Pastor Greg Runyon. \u201cI don\u2019t fault you for that \u2026 but you do have a weapon \u2014 it\u2019s a bully pulpit.\u201d\nVanessa Valdez, an attorney and resident, didn\u2019t mince her words.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here to serve us, if you refuse to act, we will make sure you do not get reelected,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will hold every one of you accountable for what happens under your leadership, starting with the death of Jaime Alanis Garc\u00eda.\u201d\nCity officials said they understand the anger, but they insist they are doing all they can to fight the federal action.\nAlexander Nguyen, city manager for Oxnard, said it was particularly alarming given the city\u2019s efforts to build trust with immigrant communities.\n\u201cThe Police Department has worked really hard over the last two decades to establish a tremendous amount of trust and respect, and open communication,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the federal actions, it clearly can drive a wedge between specific communities and their police departments.\u201d\nSince January, federal immigration agents had been parachuting into the town and surrounding communities. The agents, successfully at times, entered farms and packinghouses to apprehend immigrant workers living in the country illegally. They stopped people in their vehicles and on the street, sometimes loitering around schools.\nSome of the raids were captured on video and shared on social media, including one in May, when federal agents detained a man at a gas station, leaving his two sons behind. One of the sons was 19, but did not have a license to drive.\nThe following month, amid harvest season, federal agents were caught on video as they chased a farmworker across a strawberry field.\nAs the raids continued, community frustration grew. That was especially the case for the Police Department, whose officers often stood between agents and demonstrators.\nIt didn\u2019t help that federal authorities would drive to the police station to report that they were being followed, prompting police officers to contact immigrant rights advocates, who have been alerting residents of the operations and documenting them.\nAnd because federal agents often dressed in plain clothes, there were a few cases in which activists mistakenly followed police officers home from work. In some cases, sting operations by a police task force have been complicated by people mistaking them for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.\nBut things came to a head last month when the largest cannabis operator in the state \u2014 Glass House Brands \u2014 was the target of two separate worksite operations in Camarillo and Carpinteria.\nThere were hundreds of workers at the Camarillo property, many of them Oxnard residents, who were detained and taken away for deportation. It was during this operation that Garc\u00eda fell three stories from a greenhouse while trying to evade federal agents.\nGarc\u00eda died from his injuries two days later.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said that Garc\u00eda was not among those being pursued and that federal agents called in a medevac for him.\nThe operation led to an hours-long standoff between demonstrators and federal agents, who used less lethal ammunition to keep the crowd at bay. A few demonstrators responded by throwing rocks at federal vehicles as they left the area. At least one man was captured on video shooting a handgun at agents.\nThe operation also included members of the National Guard, prompting the National Immigration Law Center to file a Freedom of Information Act to ascertain the military\u2019s role in the operation.\n\u201cThe deployment of the U.S. military in our communities is not just unnecessary, it is yet another fear tactic this administration is using in its concerted assault on immigrant communities and our democratic traditions,\u201d said Benjamin R. Farley, special counsel at NILC, in a written statement.\nThe situation only worsened when federal agents showed up at a local hospital where injured farmworkers had been taken, prompting Oxnard police to respond.\nOxnard Police Chief Jason Benites said the officers were requested by the Fire Department, not ICE. However, their presence drove a narrative that officers were helping federal agents. He said the officers were there to ensure that ambulances could access the emergency room.\nTwo days after the operation, a federal judge would order immigration authorities to stop detaining people based on their ethnicity or occupation. The order covers seven counties: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.\nIn her ruling, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found sufficient evidence that agents were using race, language, a person\u2019s vocation or the location they are at \u2014 such as a car wash, Home Depot, swap meets or a row of street vendors \u2014 to form \u201creasonable suspicion.\u201d\nFrimpong said reliance on those factors, either alone or in combination, does not meet the requirements of the 4th Amendment. Her order prohibits agents from relying solely on those factors to establish reasonable suspicion to detain people.\nFarmworkers have long been a part of life of Oxnard. The vast coastal plain grows most of the nation\u2019s celery, along with beans, strawberries, onions and peppers, according to UC Davis data.\nChavez, the father of the farm labor movement, spent a year in the town organizing workers and registering voters.\nThe city had its share of racial strife over the years, with some Latino migrants feeling they were mistreated by a white majority that also owned the farms where they worked. But by the early 1990s, Latinos became the majority and rapidly remade political and cultural life.\nOver the next three decades, it became a magnet for Latino residents and saw its population nearly double. A thriving Latino middle class was also established.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 2010 \u2014 after a massive scandal brought government reforms \u2014 that Latinos were significantly represented in city affairs.\nThe first change came when voters elected Carmen Ramirez, the first Latina on the Oxnard City Council. She would later become the first Latina on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. An environmentalist, she along with environmental groups and residents worked together to stop the construction of a power plant. They would also address other environmental issues.\nAnother change came in 2018, when the city moved to district elections, allowing for Latino representation in government to grow.\n\u201cI think both things made the City Council more racially diverse, but also more accessible to grassroots community members who wanted to run for office, because it\u2019s a lot easier to run in a small district, especially in a small town,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cAnd so I think that that has helped bring in some pretty progressive and community-oriented folks to the City Council, who have moved forward ... some really important policies.\u201d\nImmigration raids are not new here. In the 1970s and 1980s, the federal government launched roundups targeting Mexican and Central Americans.\nOxnard was still trying to recover from racial strife at the time of the crackdown. Much of the tension was related to school segregation and police brutality. The latter led to violent riots when residents of La Colonia, a Latino neighborhood where Chavez once lived, rose up.\nBut under Police Chief Robert Owens, the department tried to shift the way it conducted police work, pushing officers to build a closer relationship with the community.\nWhen Benites joined the department more than 30 years ago, he was told that officers never got involved in federal immigration operations and that when it came to the immigrant population, everyone was treated equally and that the only time you\u2019d arrest someone was for committing a crime.\nPolice departments have walked a fine line between being peacekeepers and crimefighters, a distinction that has been difficult to make at times amid controversial shootings and past enforcements.\nIn the summer of 1978, Oxnard police officers and Ventura County sheriff deputies found themselves standing between members of the Ku Klux Klan and demonstrators. The Klan attempted to show the film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d at the town\u2019s community center in an effort to recruit new members, but their arrival led to a standoff that turned violent.\nResidents at the time accused Oxnard police officers of protecting members of the Klan. At least one officer who was there during the riot said he and others were there to keep the peace and prevent both sides from hurting each other.\nNow, officers find themselves being accused of helping federal agents.\nZucker, the co-executive of Cause, said he doesn\u2019t believe the Police Department is working with the federal government, but he does believe there is some soft cooperation. He said when federal agents go to the station and request police assistance, that same response is not provided to activists who are trying to determine what agency the federal agents work for.\n\u201cI think from the Police Department\u2019s perspective, I think what they say is: \u2018We would do this for anyone.\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s just a perception in the community that it never seems to be the case that the local police are helping the protesters or immigrants in those confrontations, and it always just so happens they seem to be making it easier for ICE to do that.\u201d\nIn order to preserve its relationship with the community, Benites said the department has reached out to immigrant rights advocates to discuss any issues. An officer also takes questions from the community on a local radio program \u2014 a long-standing tradition started many years ago and later expanded to include the Spanish media by Mayor Luis McArthur, a former Oxnard police officer.\nMost recently, Benites launched a podcast to discuss issues such as immigration operations and to clarify the department\u2019s role.\nEven before Trump was sworn into office, Benites and other police chiefs in Ventura County put out a joint statement saying they do not assist or take part in federal immigration operations. They underscored their roles are limited and often subjected to investigations targeting organized crime such as drug organizations or human trafficking operations.\nDespite the outreach, he said, it\u2019s not always guaranteed that people will listen.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do,\u201d Benites said.\nThe raids have also had an impact on the relationships between city officials and social justice groups.\nThe groups want the city to stand with the immigrant community and have asked that the city allocate money for a legal defense fund to help families that have been affected by the immigration raids.\nMcArthur, the mayor, said the city has plans to meet with all groups to address ongoing immigration issues in the city.\nMcArthur said he\u2019s hoping to keep the bridges that he and his predecessors spent years forging with local groups, but it has been difficult with the high number of operations taking place."

      "text": "Where to camp last-minute near L.A. for Labor Day weekend\n- Share via\nA three-day weekend is approaching, and you\u2019d like to escape to the mountains. But you didn\u2019t plan ahead. What\u2019s an L.A. outdoorsy resident to do?\nDon\u2019t fret, my dear Wilder, for there are about 30 first-come, first-served campgrounds around L.A. County, and I\u2019m here to suggest a few where I think even the worst of planners could snag a spot this weekend.\nLet\u2019s start with the popular first-come, first-served spots near L.A.\nIf you leave right now, meaning Thursday late morning when this newsletter publishes, you might get lucky enough to snag a spot at Buckhorn, a 38-site first-come, first-served campground in Angeles National Forest. This pine-dappled paradise is just over an hour\u2019s drive from L.A. and sits at around 6,500 feet elevation, offering a cool reprieve from your steamy apartment. (That window unit can only do so much!)\nOr you could try Chilao, an 84-site campground about 10 miles southwest of Buckhorn. It is also first-come, first-served. My wife and I once snagged the last campsite available on a Memorial Day weekend trip (in which we undoubtedly set up our tent in the dark).\nBuckhorn is very popular and fills up quickly. Chilao is also popular but larger, so again, perhaps you\u2019d get lucky! Make sure to check both the Manzanita and Little Pines loops for spots. If you left Friday morning, I think you\u2019d snag a spot at Chilao.\nCrystal Lake \u2014 not to be confused with Crystal Cove \u2014 is a 120-site campground north of Azusa in Angeles National Forest. If you forget anything, the charming Crystal Lake Cafe is on-site, selling burgers, sandwiches and an array of camping supplies and treats. It is also a popular spot, but given its size, hopefully you could find a spot on Friday.\nOn your way to Crystal Lake, you\u2019d pass Coldbrook Campground, which has 22 sites, including some spots next to the creek where the campground gets its name. If it were me and I had enough time, I\u2019d swing by Coldbrook on Friday morning to see whether any spots were still open before heading up to Crystal Lake. That said, Crystal Lake provides stunning views of the night sky. My friends recently camped there around the peak of the Perseid meteor shower and saw shooting stars.\nI am too nervous to try this, but resort Mountain High manages five campgrounds near Wrightwood, and some sites are first-come, first-served. Wrightwood is a charming mountain town, and hikes in the surrounding area offer stunning panoramic views. That said, the campgrounds are popular too, so I wouldn\u2019t leave late Friday evening expecting to find a spot.\nFor those of you who are stuck at work until 5 p.m. Friday, I want to provide options for you too.\nHere are some less popular but still great spots to consider.\n- Horse Flat: A 26-site campground in Angeles National Forest shaded by tall pine trees and near the scenic Silver Moccasin Trail. No potable water available.\n- Mt. Pacifico: Ten tent-only sites; no potable water; reached by driving a narrow dirt road for about 4.4 miles \u2014 an experience that gave me the vapors because of its steep drop-offs \u2014 and then another mile on a rougher road recommended only for high-clearance vehicles. It can also be reached by backpacking.\n- Sawmill: A remote eight-site campground with striking views of the Antelope Valley and more that\u2019s about a two-hour drive from L.A. There is no potable water, but thanks to recent renovations funded by federal Great American Outdoors money, the campground has bear boxes and campfire rings. The Pacific Crest Trail is nearby and great for day hikes! You must travel a steep dirt road to reach the campground, so consider a vehicle with good clearance.\nLastly, if you have gear handy, you could consider a quick backpacking trip. I wrote this guide on backpacking near L.A., highlighting great spots to check out. I\u2019m personally itching to get back to Valley Forge.\nRegardless of where you end up for Labor Day weekend, I hope you have a safe and serene time in our public lands. Feel free to let me know how it goes! I love hearing about your adventures in the wild.\n3 things to do\n1. Clean up a trail with new pals in Irvine\nWe Explore Earth will host a hike and trail cleanup as well as post-hike yoga and a journaling session from 5 to 8 p.m. Saturday in Irvine. Participants will meet at the Turtle Rock trailhead, hiking 1.7 miles round-trip and picking up trash along the way. Afterward, the group will be led in yoga and nature journaling. Register at eventbrite.com.\n2. Gaze at the stars in Silver Lake\nThe Los Angeles Astronomical Society will host a star party from 8 to 10:30 p.m. Thursday at Sunset Triangle Plaza (3700 Sunset Blvd.). Participants are encouraged to have dinner at nearby local restaurants while they look at the cosmos through provided telescopes. Learn more at nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov.\n3. Learn about queer ecology in L.A.\nLocal naturalist Jason Wise and biological anthropologist Natalia Reagan will host a queer ecology-focused walk at 6 p.m. next Thursday near the Elysian Park Arboretum. Participants will learn about native Californian animals that scientists have documented engaging in homosexual behavior. Tickets on a sliding scale from free to $33.85. Register at eventbrite.com.\nThe must-read\nAny hiker knows that going outside is restorative, but I was intrigued to learn in my conversation with environmental neuroscientist Marc G. Berman that a person benefits from being in nature even if they don\u2019t enjoy it. I recently spoke to Berman about his new book, \u201cNature and the Mind: The Science of How Nature Improves Cognitive, Physical, and Social Well-Being.\u201d Berman told me scientists believe nature can restore our attention spans in part because it is \u201csoftly fascinating,\u201d like when we gaze at a waterfall. \u201cThe kind of stimulation that gives you this restful, restorative experience has to be softly fascinating and not harshly fascinating,\u201d Berman said. The thing that will stay with me most, though, is what Berman told me about the humanizing effects nature can have on our psyche \u2014 a crucial bit of data in the midst of so much dehumanizing rhetoric in the news.\nHappy adventuring,\nP.S.\nBack in June, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins rescinded the 2001 \u201cRoadless Rule,\u201d a landmark environmental law that established significant protections \u2014 namely from road construction and logging \u2014 for 58.5 million acres of national forestland, including 4.4 million acres in California. The Trump administration says the rule must be revoked to decrease wildfire risk, a claim that environmental advocates found dubious, arguing this is yet another public land grab. Friends of the Inyo recently flagged that the public comment period, which is part of the formal rulemaking process, is expected to start soon on what should be done next regarding the Roadless Rule. You should be able to check this U.S. Forest Service page to stay apprised of the process.

City Council voted last week to draft an ordinance that would allow buildings of up to six stories to have a single stairway.\n- Advocates say it would be easier and cheaper to build on smaller lots, and that could lead to more family-sized apartments in the city.\n- Proponents of double stairways say they are a key safety measure, giving residents two options for fleeing a fire, along with a separate route for firefighters.\nArchitect Simon Ha was trying to squeeze an apartment building onto a 6,400-square foot lot in Hollywood.\nThe city of Los Angeles requires two stairways for such buildings, which limited the configurations Ha could use. After racking his brain, he finally came up with a solution.\n\u201cIt was like designing a Swiss watch,\u201d he said of the 2023 project.\nNow, the L.A. City Council is on the brink of allowing just one stairway for buildings of up to six stories, making it easier and cheaper to build on smaller lots \u2014 but raising concerns about escape routes in a fire or earthquake.\nCouncilmember Nithya Raman, who introduced the single stairway proposal with Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky, said she wants to speed up development to address the city\u2019s housing crisis and to encourage the construction of apartments big enough for families. And she believes safety needn\u2019t be sacrificed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to say, \u2018How can we build more safely \u2014 and build more overall?\u2019\u201d Raman said in an interview.\nUntil recently, New York, Seattle and Honolulu were among the few American cities that allowed single stairways in buildings of up to six stories. Since 2022, amid a nationwide affordable housing crunch, at least 16 cities and states have proposed or enacted single stairway regulations, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts study released in February.\nThe double stairway rule, in place in California since 1981, makes it harder to build apartments with more than two bedrooms, urban planners and architects said.\nHow can we achieve more and better housing? Denser neighborhoods. Smaller homes, some modular or printed in 3-D. Properties co-owned. ADUs sold separately.\nApartments typically have to be laid out along a long hallway, with windows on only one side of each unit, resulting in less light and ventilation, said Stephen Smith, who is executive director of the Center for Building in North America and one of the single stairway\u2019s biggest advocates.\n\u201cFor small lots in particular, the second stairway can eat up a huge amount of the building\u2019s footprint,\u201d he said.\nA single stair layout without a long hallway could mean more room for larger units\nDouble-stair layout\nStair #1\nStudio\nStudio\nStudio\nStudio\nStudio\nElevator\nStudio\nStair #2\nStudio\nStudio\nStudio\nStudio\nSingle-stair layout\nStair #1\n3-Bedroom\nElevator\n3-Bedroom\n2-Bedroom\nDouble-stair layout\nSingle-stair layout\nStudio\nStudio\n3-Bedroom\nStudio\nStudio\nStair #1\nStair #1\nStudio\nElevator\nElevator\nStudio\nStudio\n2 -Bedroom\nStudio\nStair #2\n3-Bedroom\nStudio\nStudio\nBased on design by Simon Ha\nGabrielle LaMarr LeMee LOS ANGELES TIMES\nUnder state law, L.A. can reduce the number of stairways it requires, as long as it implements other restrictions, such as high-end sprinkler systems. Raman and Yaroslavsky\u2019s proposal for single stairway buildings would limit the number of units per floor to four.\nBut proponents of double stairways say they are a key safety measure, giving residents two options for fleeing a fire, along with a separate route for firefighters.\nFrank Lima, a Los Angeles firefighter and general secretary-treasurer of the International Assn. of Fire Fighters, or IAFF, said the stairways are a life-and-death issue.\n\u201c[A single stairway] forces building occupants to go down a stairwell while firefighters go up a stairwell,\u201d Lima said. \u201cThat delays fire attack, delays people getting out of a building \u2014 when seconds count.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you try to cut corners to save money or make more units, it shouldn\u2019t be at the price of children that die,\u201d Lima said.\nThe IAFF, which represents firefighters and emergency medical technicians across the U.S. and Canada, has strongly opposed single stairway proposals \u2014 \u201cI\u2019d rather call it \u2018only one way out,\u2019\u201d Lima said.\nTo solve its housing crisis Los Angeles must build. Here\u2019s where:\nOn Aug. 20, the City Council voted 13 to 1 to request that city staffers draft a single stairway ordinance.\nIn a memo to the council, City Planning Director Vincent Bertoni wrote that the single stairway proposal could make a \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to the city\u2019s housing supply.\n\u201cThe result is that family-sized units \u2014 a much needed segment of Los Angeles\u2019 housing stock \u2014 are not being produced at the scale required to meet existing and projected needs,\u201d he wrote of the double stairway requirement.\nAbout 14% of rental units in the city are three or more bedrooms, according to the Planning Department.\nZachary Pitts, the Los Angeles director of YIMBY Action, which advocates for more affordable housing, said he had a hard time finding a three-bedroom apartment in downtown Los Angeles.\nThere were plenty of studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms, but places big enough for his family of four cost a small fortune.\n\u201cWe ended up buying a single-family home, since a mortgage was lower than the prices we were being quoted,\u201d Pitts said.\nThe surprising story, in words and pictures, behind the homeless crisis in Los Angeles \u2014 a tale of law enforcement, housing and economic crosswinds.\nHa, the architect, said that ditching the double stairway requirement could enable developers to produce \u201cEast Coast-style\u201d townhouses like those in New York \u2014 a contrast to the \u201cpodium-style\u201d buildings now going up in L.A., which generally take up a half or whole block.\nHa has designed buildings from San Francisco to San Diego, though most of his work is in Los Angeles, where he is the architect of many micro-apartment complexes, which contain only studios.\nSmall parcels of 7,500 square feet or less, where a single stairway would make apartments easier to build, often sit empty for long periods, creating \u201cmissing teeth\u201d in the city\u2019s layout, Ha said.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department declined to comment on the single stairway proposal, saying it is under review by the city fire marshal. The councilmembers behind the proposal say the department has been consulted every step of the way.\nRaman said she sees \u201cno reduction in fire safety.\u201d\n\u201cNew fire safety standards in our building code have made it so new buildings are much safer overall,\u201d she said.\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts study, co-written and researched by Smith of the Center for Building in North America, found that in New York, the rate of fire deaths in single stairway buildings was the same as in other residential buildings.\n\u201cThis [double stairway] code originates from when people were cooking with open flames, when there were no sprinklers or fire alarms,\u201d Smith said.\nCity Councilmember Adrin Nazarian voted yes on the Aug. 20 motion to draft a single stairway ordinance, though he had previously expressed reservations about earthquake safety.\nSeattle has single stairways but \u201cless than one-tenth the number of seismic activity we have in our region,\u201d he said during a council meeting.\nCouncilmember Traci Park was the lone no vote.\n\u201cGenerally in life, when you have more exits and evacuation routes, things are generally more safe,\u201d she said."
