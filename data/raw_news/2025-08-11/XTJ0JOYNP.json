  "title": "The Rivian R1T Quad Might Be The Most Incredible EV On The Road",
  "description": "With advanced technology and enhanced off-road systems, the Rivian R1 Quad is the brand's pinnacle, with four-motor performance designed to climb the highest hills.",
  "content": "Last year Rivian reached a milestone in its short life: just after announcing its next models, the R2, R3 and R3X, the company rolled out an updated R1 line: A new second generation of the R1T and R1S. These second generation models, while looking almost identical to the first generation, feature new electronics, new technology, an in-house hands-free driving system, a longer-range battery\u2014adding up to 50 miles\u2014and more power.\n\nThe pinnacle of the new Rivian flagship is the R1 Quad.\n\nWith four motors, one for each wheel, and delivering 1,025 HP, the Rivian R1 Quad, priced from about $116,000 and topping out at $130,000 for the launch edition, is available in both the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV. And they are designed to be not just the ultimate EV, but the ultimate off-roader.\n\nFor off-roaders, horsepower isn\u2019t really the key ingredient to conquering a vaunted hill or trail. For the R1 Quad, HP is more of a by-product of four motors and engineering designed to climb every mountain and go the long-haul distance, delivering as much power to each wheel as the driver and circumstances require.\n\nSkill, equipment and engineering are far more important, as is torque: the new Quad delivers 1,198 pound-feet of torque. Together, this is really where this electric SUV shines.\n\nThe R1 Quad\u2019s engineering was real-world tested in two particularly grueling competitions: The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb and the Rebelle Rally. The Pikes Peak Hill Climb pits performance cars against the 12.4 mile, oxygen-starved 14,115 foot Colorado summit. A natural space for EVs it\u2019s less so for pickup trucks and large SUVs. After Rivian test engineer Gardiner Nichols ran the Hill Climb in his own R1T, the company added his feedback to improve the R1 Quad\u2019s torque, power and battery management; in 2024 Nichols drove the Second Gen R1T Quad to place in the exhibition division. The resulting production version of the R1 Quad incorporates even more of Nichols\u2019 findings.\n\nTo test the R1 Quad in an off-road setting, the company entered it in the 2024 Rebelle Rally, the longest off-road rally in the US and one of the most grueling; competitors, all women, compete using maps and compasses. The terrain ranges from steep mountains and rock faces to deep desert sands and rutted trails.\n\nRivian engineers Lilly Macaruso and Alex Anderson won the overall competition, the first EV to take the top prize, building on Rivian\u2019s growing off-road legacy. But this race was also about learning; Macaruso and Anderson focused on how to improve drive modes and to better tune each aspect of the R1 Quad\u2019s performance. The result? Not just a more robust off-road experience but also, new features that allow it to deliver an over-the-top performance.\n\nKick Turn And RAD Tuning \u2018Party Tricks\u2019 Are Useful, Too\n\nThe pinnacle of these new features are two new drive modes: RAD Tuner and Kick Turn. These harness the R1 Quad\u2019s advanced technology and pair it with the four motor system and four wheel steering to allow two new functions: Highly customizable 4WD settings, known as RAD Tuner and the ability to execute a turn so tight the R1 Quad essentially spins in place, known as Kick Turn.\n\nRAD Tuner, which stands for Rivian Adventure Department, functions like the equalizer on a stereo system, allowing the driver to set the level of wheel slip, ride height and torque balance, among others. The system visualizes each setting in an animated graph.\n\nKick Turn, once activated, requires the driver to tap buttons on either side of the steering wheel for a directional turn; the harder and longer you press the button the faster and tighter the turn. The gaming-like control only takes only a few minutes to learn, though regulating speed, accommodating pitch and road conditions on a trail are more challenging.\n\nI had the chance to try Kick Turn on a closed dirt course, the only place it\u2019s proper to learn to use it. It\u2019s easy and intuitive to use, unlike some other tank-turn or customized four-wheel steering systems on high-end off-roaders. Once on the trail, though, Kick Turn was useful but took more focus to get right.\n\nChanges Add Up To One Of The Most Well-Received Off-Roaders Of The Year\n\nThe numbers presented by the Rivian R1 Gen 2 Quad are pretty impressive: the company says it will hit 0-60 MPH in 2.5 seconds in addition to generating 1,025 HP and 1,198 pound-feet of torque; driving range has increased to up to 400 miles in Max battery pack models and driving in Conserve mode; in standard mode range is estimated at 374 miles, still stellar for an SUV or pickup truck.\n\nNew features are pretty stellar, too: Rivian just rolled out its updated hands-free highway driving system after taking on the development of the system itself. Rivian says that by bringing it all in house the company can update the system and activate new features more quickly. With more autonomous vehicles on the road and more consumer-driven vehicles offering level-two hands-free highway driving, remaining competitive is key to staying on top.\n\nIn the exterior R1 Quad buyers will notice new signifier details. It starts with the Quad logo on the rear of tail gate and the Rivian nameplate shadowlined in Laguna Blue, which is also the color of the brake calipers. Most iconic is the Rivian Gear Guard mascot on the the right side of the tailgate, its hair blowing in the wind in a nod to the 1,025 HP. Buyers of the R1 Quad will also be the first easily charge at a Tesla Supercharger; this model comes with a NACS charge port, though the R1 Quad can still charge at a standard CCS charger with an adapter.\n\nThe performance the details and the new technology added up to one of the best received updated off-roaders of the year so far; reviews from top automotive writers, off-road writers and experts have been overwhelmingly glowing. I can add to that: After spending a day learning just how capable the Rivian R1 Quad is I was convinced. It easily conquered trails I\u2019d previously only thought a small ATV would be capable of climbing.\n\nTrue to its roots and mission, the interior of the Rivian R1T and R1S are pretty much unchanged; that\u2019s good for those who love the large expanses of wood and leatherette, plaid fabrics and accent piping that create a cabin that feels like a retreat. Buyers who want something more distinct in the top-of-the-line model, such as fancier seats or more plush details will have to rest in the exclusive details and colors that R1 Gen 2 Quad buyers are offered.\n\nThe cabin is anchored by screens and that is where most functions live. The multimedia system is still fairly intuitive and easy to figure out, though it may take even digital natives some time to find all its fun features and functions.",

      "text": "Here\u2019s the magic of electric cars: carmakers can improve battery performance, the drive experience and even boost power with just a software update. And that\u2019s the mission behind the second generation fo the Rivian R1S SUV (and R1T pickup truck): More miles, more efficiencies and more power through a new electronics architecture and hardware systems that improve performance now and set the stage for improvements in the future.\nThe second generation revamp of this three row, seven passenger off-road capable SUV represents an almost thoroughly redesigned technology architecture, from battery and power to the multimedia touchscreen user experience.\nIn fact, the only thing that is mostly untouched is the look and style of the Rivian R1S, which maintains its iconic look of square corners and rounded lights.\nPowertrain Improvements Mean Better Performance, Easier Maintenance\nRivian, which engineered the \u2018skateboard\u2019 structure for EV battery packs, has continued to tinker with the design to make batteries easier to manufacture and access, and added cooling systems to preserve range and cabin comfort. And for the second generation, Rivian is offering a new lithium-iron phosphate battery that inches driving range up by 5% to a top range of 420 miles on a charge.\nProbably the most exciting news, however, is the increase in power output and the number of power options. There are five model options starting at about $76,000: the Dual Standard model that delivers 270 miles and 533 hp; the Dual Large model ($82,900) with a 330 mile range and 665 hp; the Dual Max model ($89,900) with a 410 mile range and 665 hp, the 3-motor Tri Max model ($108,650) with a range of 371 miles and 850 hp, or the Quad Max four-motor model that will deliver up to 1,025 hp. Rivian hasn\u2019t yet announced a mileage range or price on the Quad Max, but based on the first generation, range will likely be up to 400 miles or so in Conserve mode, and pricing will likely north of $125,000. Rivian is taking orders and will finalize details when production begins.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nSetting The Path For Smarter Drive Assist Systems\nAnother big part of the update to the R1 platform is a proprietary hands-free driving system. The second generation R1S and R1T are outfitted with more cameras, radars, sensors and AI prediction technology that, when the software updates are issued, will allow drivers a smarter adaptive cruise system with hands-free driving and automatic lane changes on designated highways and in proper conditions.\nAlso set for updates via software are Rivian\u2019s new headlights; when updates are issued, they will allow greater visibility in poor weather and at night.\nA More Comfortable Ride Experience\nRivian\u2019s SUV and truck are known for off-road mastery, which can also mean a less comfortable ride on pavement. So, the company sought to, as part of software and hardware improvements, reduce the impact of bumps, quick stops and hard turns with updates to the suspension and air springs.\nMore Phone And App-Based Functions\nRivian updated the already very good user experience with new screens and functions, and added new apps from Apple and Google. The center screen is where most functions are found, even side mirror and headlight settings, and it now allows streaming through Connect+; this means that while parked, passengers can watch a movie on the large main screen.\nAdding to in-cabin experience is a new premium sound system from Apple, the Spacial Audio system with Dolby Atmos, which is designed to deliver a full range of sound.\nAnd, owners can keep a \u2018key\u2019 in Apple Wallet or a Google Pixel phone and lock, unlock and drive the Rivian without a physical key fob.\nElevated New Interior Choices Elevate The Feel\nRivian offers four interior choices on the Dual models, which range from dark to dark and light colors, with classic dark wood surfaces framed in chrome. On the Tri Motor model, though, Rivian offers its newest interior: Ascent. Notable for blonde wood, bronze accents and light and dark leatherette upholstery, the overall feeling is elevated.\nThe interior can be further enhanced in any model with a smart panoramic glass roof, a $1,500 addition. This iconic roof, which is tinted to keep the cabin cool, can now be electronically frosted with the touch of a button.\nWith the addition of the lower-level Dual Motor trims, Rivian actually decreased pricing a bit, with a starting price that is about $3,000 less than the prior entry level model, potentially making Rivian ownership more attractive to more buyers. And now there are five models to choose from, as well some new options, giving buyers even more choices. But it\u2019s the future promise of software updates over the air updates that make the second generation a standout improvement over the first models. And that\u2019s an achievement, since the original Rivian R1S has been the one to top."

      "text": "[UPDATE] Rivian stock has been on a tear this past week. Deliveries have jumped and the R1T and R1S continue to get stellar reviews.\nBut Rivian\u2019s breakthrough vehicle won\u2019t arrive until the R2, which the company is expected to preview to the public in early 2024.\nThe R2, hitting the market by 2026, is expected to be offered as both a compact SUV and pickup priced at between $40,000 and $60,000, much less expensive than its current products, which start at over $70,000 but typically skew towards $80,000 and above.\nLike Rivian\u2019s current R1T truck and R1S SUV, the R2 will be off-road-capable (via Car and Driver).\n\u201cThe R2 captures the essence of our brand, but of course, to a smaller package and in a much lower price point,\u201d said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe in the third quarter earnings conference call in November.\nScaringe, keenly aware of the high prices that put its cars beyond reach of the average car buyer, repeated the-cheaper-model-is-coming mantra during the earnings call and made it clear that this will make its EVs available to many more car buyers.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\u201cSo if you look at R2 launching in 2026,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're enormously excited about the product, but to do it at a price point that's considerably lower than what we have in R1 and at a form factor, a size that [fits] the largest segment in the United States,\u201d he said.\nRivian future hinges on R2\nThe R2 is shaping up to be analogous to Tesla\u2019s 2016 introduction of the Model 3, which transformed Tesla from a manufacturer of overpriced elite EVs to a mainstream car maker \u2014 putting it on a path to be one of the top global vehicle manufacturers by output.\nRivian\u2019s \u201cbusiness will grow disproportionately\u201d based on the coming R2, according to Scaringe, with the \u201cR2 platform representing a significant step up in volume,\u201d he said to Bloomberg earlier this year, adding that the R2 will be the \u201ccore focus\u201d now for Rivian.\nThe R2 will also have domestically-made batteries \u2014 though reports indicate there have been some battery shake-ups in house \u2014 that meet Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) federal EV tax credit criteria. Currently, Rivian cars are not eligible for the entire credit. The R2 will be eligible for the entire $7,500 credit, potentially driving down the price even more.\nRivian delivered 15,564 vehicles in the third quarter, more than twice the 6,584 units it delivered in the third quarter of last year. And it expects to deliver 54,000 vehicles in the fiscal year, more than double the roughly 20,000 units delivered in fiscal 2022.\nAnother positive: Rivian and Tesla have reached an agreement to integrate Rivian\u2019s vehicles into Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network. Rivian cars will adopt a charging port compatible with Tesla\u2019s starting in 2025, which Scaringe described as a more \u201celegant\u201d charging solution.\nRivian has also been delivering electric vans to Amazon in the U.S. and begun to deliver vans in Europe and AT&T announced on December 14 it will purchase Rivian vans and R1 vehicles for its commercial fleets.\nDemand shifting to SUV\nThe demand mix is shifting to the R1S SUV from the R1T pickup, according to Scaringe. In the first quarter of this year, roughly 75 percent of production was for the R1T but the \u201cdemand mix\u201d is just the opposite now: it\u2019s 75 percent R1S, he said.\n\u201c[But] we\u2019re now getting...to the point where production matches demand,\u201d he said to Bloomberg. Rivian will spend the next few quarters focusing on getting R1S production to catch R1S demand."

      "text": "Counting a century since its very first run, the Broadmoor Pikes Peak International Hill Climb is one of the country\u2019s long-standing extreme automobile races, drawing fans deep into the Rockies to witness the action. Brought to the public by Gran Turismo, the event happens annually and is known as one of the most dangerous racing challenges in the United States. It is also the second oldest auto race in the United States, second to only the Indy 500. In less than fifteen minutes, drivers take on 12.42 miles of narrow highway, switchbacks and unpredictable weather to reach the 14,115 ft. summit finish line, a route that takes regular visitors nearly three hours to complete. To get a firsthand perspective on just how much preparation goes into the race, I was able to join professional racer James Clay thanks to his sponsor, OPTIMA Batteries. With twenty four years of experience in the industry and his own BMW performance parts company, BimmerWorld, James was an insightful guide to the effort that goes into making the Hill Climb possible and successful year after year. This year marks BimmerWorld\u2019s 25th anniversary, as well as the 100th running of the climb.\nWith the race taking place on Sunday, June 26th, I made my way to Denver just before the weekend, giving me enough time to watch practice runs of the race sections starting at dawn. By 9:00am, practice had concluded, and the drivers took advantage of some much needed down time in anticipation of the real thing. The runs were my first in-person taste of Pikes Peak, which happened to be clear and sunny on Friday morning. Steep drop-offs, loose rock and expansive views line the two-lane highway running up the mountain, which is more often enveloped by low-hanging clouds. Often foggy and shrouded in unpredictability, the mountain cultivates a personality of its own, especially when you realize just how daunting the race can be to drivers with years of experience, let alone casual visitors. Starting at over 9,000 feet of altitude, the environment, combined with the anticipation of competition can have a significant physical effect on both drivers and those rooting for them.\nDetermined to keep coming back better, faster, and stronger, James and his team had been building the car they used in the race for nearly five years. \"The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb is the most challenging event we run every year and the most difficult event I have ever run in 25 years of motorsport,\u201d James said as he reflected on his relationship to the event. \u201cWhile a tremendous amount of the result depends on that development and preparation, we are all racing the mountain and weather conditions thrown at us on race day.\u201d\nLater that evening, I headed to Downtown Colorado Springs to the Pikes Peak Fan Fest, a yearly tradition that brings extreme sports lovers together to talk racing, compare notes and enjoy local food and drinks over the course of a night dedicated to the Hill Climb. The atmosphere was all about letting loose, rooting for favorites and looking forward to watching the race live knowing everyone was ready to brave the long wait on race day for the same reasons.\nSaturday, June 25th was all about final prep, and I visited the track to see the paddock being prepared for the race. These were just the finishing touches: many teams arrive at the mountain a month in advance to dial in their vehicles and host official test days. I wrapped up the day early knowing that getting to the race gate early would be a priority the next morning; Pikes Peak fan traffic is notorious. I planned to get to the race gate by 2am to avoid traffic and weather delays, but there were still plenty of cars lined up on the road leading to the raceway. The weather had been temperamental the day before, and was already causing delays hours before the racers\u2019 7-7:30am start.\nAs a media guest, restrictions were much more limiting for this event than other races I\u2019ve covered, speaking to the logistics of planning one of America\u2019s most dangerous races. The highway leading up the mountain becomes a one-way road during the race, meaning anyone who is hoping to watch has to make it to a designated viewing area before the entry gates close. Once you\u2019re at your viewing area, you\u2019re expected to stay there until the conclusion of the race meaning you have to bring plenty of layers, hot drinks and whatever else you need in the hours leading up to the morning. As people filtered in, I could tell these were the fans who didn\u2019t mind a bit of inconvenience and cold weather if it meant they could witness racing history unfold. After all, this year's event was a centennial celebration as much as it was a tradition.\nI watched the competitors fly by from the starting line with the rest of the OPTIMA team. An ideal vantage point, the starting point gave me time to admire every vehicle up close as it took its place before taking off towards the summit. The paddock had a few wide screens streaming the action from the starting line and at various points along the track all the way back to Colorado Springs for those who couldn\u2019t make it to the event in person. While the race sees everything from snow to hail and rain, the morning of the 26th was especially foggy, rendering some of the cars all but invisible as they sped through the mist.\nIn what seemed like a split second, the race was over as quickly as it began, bringing two days of preparations to a climactic finish. Overcoming exceptionally low visibility, and slippery conditions, James Clay took 11th place overall and 2nd place in his division. Robin Shute took 1st place both overall in a 2018 Wolf TSC-FS, with David Donohue and David Donner following close behind in a pair of Porsches. Rolling his vehicle once on a dicey corner and getting right back on the road immediately after, Levi Shirley broke the race\u2019s record for the fastest car to both roll and finish the race. Other honorable mentions include Henry Hill\u2019s Rookie of the Year award, and Rhys and Rod Millens\u2019 tied division win, which carried on the father-son duo\u2019s family legacy on Pikes Peak. \u201cIt was an honor to have OPTIMA Batteries as the official battery of the legendary Pikes Peak International Hill Climb this year,\u201d stated Cam Douglass, the Director of Marketing for OPTIMA Batteries A Clarios Brand, in a closing statement. \u201cThe conditions on the mountain are rarely favorable, and this year was no exception. We are happy our racers finished safely and are already looking forward to next year.\u201d\nBy that evening, I was saying goodbye to both Pikes Peak and Colorado Springs, but the scale of the race stayed with me. Wrapping extreme sports, showmanship and the uncertainty of the mountain into a few heart stopping moments, the race draws diehard and attracts new ones every year. Woven into the fabric of Colorado\u2019s outdoor adventure community, the Hill Climb will return home to Pikes Peak next summer.
