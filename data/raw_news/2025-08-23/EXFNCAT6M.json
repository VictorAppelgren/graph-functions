  "content": "Postal services in Europe and around the world plan to halt shipping merchandise to the U.S. as the Trump administration\u2019s end of the de minimus tariff exemption goes into effect.\n\nThe \"de minimus\" exemption allowed internation carriers to ship goods valued under $800 to the U.S. without paying any duties.\n\nThe White House announced the end of the exemption weeks ago, linking it to fentanyl and other illicit drugs coming into the U.S.\n\nDHL, Europe\u2019s largest shipping provider, said in a statement on its website Friday that \"Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany will no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S.\" effective immediately.\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES TARIFF INVESTIGATION INTO FURNITURE IMPORTS TO RESTORE US MANUFACTURING\n\nThe end of the exemption goes into effect Aug. 29.\n\nDHL said its restrictions on packages would be temporary, explaining they were necessary because of \"new processes required by U.S. authorities for postal shipping, which differ from the previously applicable regulations.\"\n\nThe company continued, \"Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\"\n\nPostal services in Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Austria, France and Belgium have similarly said they plan to pause shipments to the U.S.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Royal Mail has also temporarily paused shipments, according to the BBC.\n\nOutside of Europe, Asian countries like Singapore and Thailand said their countries would also hold on shipments until there\u2019s more clarity on the new rules.\n\nCANADA LIFTS TARIFFS ON SOME US GOODS TO RESUME TRADE TALKS\n\n\"The halt underscores the sweeping disruption caused by President Trump\u2019s decision to eliminate the de minimis threshold, which previously allowed low-value parcels to enter the US without customs duties,\" Thailand Post said in a statement on its website. \"The exemption, capped at US$800 per person per day, facilitated millions of small packages from around the world entering the US smoothly.\"\n\nAustralia Post said it has paused transit on a handful of packages from other countries bound for the U.S.\n\n\"We have been working hard with US authorities and international partners to adapt our services to meet the new US de minimis requirements so UK consumers and businesses can continue to use our services when they come into effect,\" the Royal Mail said.\n\nThe U.S. ended the de minimus exemption for China in May.\n\nThe White House said at the time that many Chinese-based shippers hide illicit substances, including synthetic opioids, in low-value packages to exploit the de minimis exemption.\n\nThe administration said that the amount of de minimus shipments coming into the U.S. has increased from 134 million to 1.34 billion between 2-15 and 2024, according to the Financial Times.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIt has also helped Chinese-based fast fashion companies like Temu and Shein, which ship directly to customers.\n\nFOX Business has reached out to the White House and DHL for comment.",

The newly signed executive order will now provide some relief to Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu.\nStarting Wednesday, the \"de minimis\" tariff will drop from 120% to 54%.

The announcements were made in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, which is set to end a tariff loophole on low-value imports next month.\nShein, a fast-fashion retailer now based in Singapore, will increase its prices starting on April 25 and has encouraged its shoppers to buy their products \"now at today\u2019s rates.\"\nMultiple outlets reported that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, sent out a similar notice as well.\n\"Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up,\" Shein said in a statement. \"To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025.\"\nPRESSURE FROM SHEIN, TEMU ACCELERATE RETAIL CLOSURES\n\"Until April 25, prices will stay the same, so you can shop now at today\u2019s rates,\" Shein continued. \"We stand ready to make sure your orders arrive smoothly during this time.\"\nIt remains unclear how expensive these goods will become.
