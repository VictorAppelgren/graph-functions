  "description": "New candidates include current and former Federal Reserve officials.",
  "content": "New candidates include current and former Federal Reserve officials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump wants to Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nAs part of that campaign, he has widened the search for a replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with whom the president has an escalating clash over interest rates.\n\nPowell\u2019s term as chair expires in May.\n\nTrump has strongly and bluntly indicated he would like the next chair to share his hawkish view toward aggressive monetary policy.\n\nGlobal markets don\u2019t like to see the independence of the central bank threatened by intense political efforts by the executive office to influence monetary policy.\n\nHistorically, massive economic and market failures result once the politicians take the keys to the bank away from the economists.\n\nTrump can\u2019t legally fire Powell. So he has escalated a campaign to create a \u201cshadow presidency\u2019\u2019 at the Federal Reserve and name a new chair before May in an attempt to pressure Powell to lower interest rates.\n\nThe president has three options.\n\nAll center on the recent nomination of Council of Economic Advisors Chair Stephen Miran to fill a surprise temporary opening on the seven-member Fed Board of Governors.\n\u2022 Elevate Miran, a Trump loyalist who has advocated for massive Fed reforms, to a permanent role and name him the next chair.\n\u2022 Nominate an external permanent replacement for Miran who would join the Fed in January and take over as chair in May.\n\u2022 Tap an internal candidate as the next chair.\n\nThe president has widened the search and added the Fed\u2019s two vice chairs, Michelle Bowman and Philip Jefferson, and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, Bloomberg reported Aug. 11.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is running the search, will interview additional candidates in the coming weeks and present a short list of finalists to Trump.\n\nThe president is expected to make a final announcement this fall, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOther candidates who remain under consideration include:\n\u2022 James Bullard, former head of the St. Louis Fed.\n\nAs for Powell, Fed chairs traditionally leave the central bank when their terms run out.\n\nIf he chooses, he can stay on as a governor until 2028.\n\nTrump appointed Bowman to the Fed in 2018 and made her vice chair for supervision earlier this year.\n\nJefferson was appointed to the board by President Joseph Biden in 2022 and appointed vice chair in 2023.\n\nFed to vote on interest rates next month\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s dual congressional mandate requires monetary policy that balances low unemployment and low inflation.\n\nThe Fed has maintained a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach to the benchmark Federal Funds Rate this year in part to assess whether the expected tariff inflation will be a one-time hit to the economy or a longer sustained blow.\n\u2022 Former Federal Reserve official sends bold message on 'regime change'\n\nFed officials had been expected to cut rates modestly in 2025, with their June projections showing a median suitable Federal Funds Rate of 3.9% at year-end, down from the current 4.25%\u20134.50%.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee held interest rates steady for a fifth straight time in July.\n\nBowman and Waller, also a Trump appointee, dissented in favor of a .25% cut, pointing to a weakening labor market.\n\nThe next FOMC meeting is Sept. 17.\n\nThe Senate is not expected to vote on Miran\u2019s nomination in time for him to attend.\n\nThe CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool places the chance of a .25% rate cut in September at 85.9%.",
