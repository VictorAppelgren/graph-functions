      "feedback": "This draft hits the tariffication theme but could be world-class with a tighter, fully sourced causal chain, explicit near‑term catalysts, and crisp thresholds for 0–3 weeks. Add an explicit, testable chain: tariff headlines (Japan autos cut to 15%, India 50% looming, EU 15% MFN framework) drive immediate market volatility, tighten auto margins and pricing power, and feed into housing/retail pricing signals via consumer inflation; anchor each link to specific data points (S15934PBQ for Japan autos pass‑through and Toyota/Ford impact; DGG6HXUFZ and VCZKKPORO for India and de minimis/Canada moves; the EU framework in 9/ Yahoo Reuters item; 12 for tariff inflation timing). Quantify near‑term effects with concrete numbers: Toyota NA operating income swung to a $438m NA loss (S15934PBQ); Ford tariff costs >$2b this year (S15934PBQ); June average tariff rate around 9% versus earlier 15% estimates (12); apparel back‑to‑school pricing around 9% YoY (CNN/12); potential tariff revenue rhetoric of $700–$800b or higher (7) to frame macro‑ficus vs debt relief (19). Reconcile conflicting statements (Toyota saying tariffs aren’t to blame for higher prices vs Nikkei noting pass‑through) by framing as “headline messaging vs price data signals” and cite both sides. Strengthen the near‑term scenario structure: base case (moderate pass‑through, EU autos relief pill likely only after timely legislation, India 50% tariff still looming), upside (EU autos relief sooner, broader sector concessions), downside (tariff inflation accelerates if LCs widen; India/other sectors escalate). Add explicit triggers/invalidation: 1) EU autos relief implementation timing; 2) Aug 28 de minimis end; 3) India 50% tariff activation; 4) furniture tariff investigation results (50 days) per 9RVBO4NQJ; 5) cross‑border flows and chip/packaging constraints (11). Tie to price/earnings/macro reads with minimal non‑essential narrative, and ensure every claim maps to IDs (S15934PBQ, DGG6HXUFZ, VCZKKPORO, 9, 12, 7, 11, 27, 19, 9RVBO4NQJ). Structure length to a tight 120–180 words by consolidating the current paragraph into a single, continuous causal thread plus a short monitor list: monitor tariff announcements/timelines, price pass‑through in autos/furniture/apparel, tariff receipts trajectory for debt impact (7, 19), and cross‑border policy moves (Canada rollback; EU framework). Output the revised piece with precise parenthetical citations after each data point, and prune extraneous color commentary (logos, side stories) to preserve the 0–3 week horizon focus.",
