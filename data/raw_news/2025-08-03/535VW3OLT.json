  "title": "This Small Luxury Crossover Is Built for Driving Fun under $40,000",
  "description": "Compact, stylish, and exciting to drive, this luxury crossover proves you don\u2019t need to spend big to have fun.",
  "content": "Finding a small luxury crossover that\u2019s genuinely fun to drive under $40,000 can be a challenge, but one model stands out as the clear choice for enthusiasts. It combines playful handling, premium touches, and everyday usability, all at a price that won\u2019t stretch your budget.\n\nBehind the wheel, it delivers sharp steering, agile cornering, and a lively engine that makes even routine drives exciting. Inside, the cabin is filled with upscale materials and modern tech, giving it a premium feel without losing its quirky charm or practicality.\n\nFor drivers who want luxury and driving excitement in a compact, city-friendly package, this crossover checks every box. It proves that you don\u2019t need a massive budget to enjoy a premium experience that\u2019s as entertaining as it is versatile.\n\nMini's New Countryman Is a Fantastic Crossover at an Affordable Price\n\nMini is a brand that has defined itself over the years by selling small cars. The Countryman has defied the classic formula by being essentially a big version of the Cooper. Despite straying from what made the British automaker so popular in the first place, the crossover checks just about every box.\n\nThe Countryman competes in the luxury subcompact SUV segment, going up against some pretty nice little crossovers like the Volvo XC40 and the Mercedes-Benz GLB. It actually shares its platform and powertrain with the X1, meaning you can get BMW levels of performance at a discount. This is one of the things that sets it apart from all of its rivals, with a starting price that is thousands of dollars lower than some of its top competitors.\n\nFor the time being, Mini only offers the Countryman in S guise ALL4 guise, though the brand may add different variants in the future. There are two distinct trim levels to choose from, the Signature Plus and the Iconic. Both are well-equipped and you won't be disappointed either way.\n\nIf you're looking to stick under the $40,000 mark, then stick with the Signature Plus. However, the Iconic offers a lot of value for the additional money. It comes with an upgraded audio system, augmented reality navigation, parking assist, and power-adjustable front seats with a massage function.\n\nThe Countryman was fully redesigned for the 2025 model year, so changes were kept minimal for 2026. A John Cooper Works Style package is now on offer, adding a number of aesthetic elements as well as adaptive suspension for $1,200. You can also order any model with racing stripes now. Finally, any 2026 Countryman built after July will come with digital key functionality, allowing you to use your smartphone as a key.\n\nCoverage on the Countryman is pretty average for the segment. Both the bumper-to-bumper and powertrain plans sit at about the average point, though a few competitors do offer longer plans. What we do find impressive is the fact that Mini will cover scheduled maintenance for the first three years of ownership.\n\nThe 2026 Countryman Has the Bones and Heart of a BMW\n\nIf you're looking to grab a new BMW X1, you're likely to spend well over the $40,000 mark, especially if you want it as well-equipped as the Mini. We think that the platform and powertrain on offer in the Countryman make it a truly enjoyable crossover to drive, keeping your daily commute from turning into a bore.\n\nWe're not claiming that the Mini Countryman is a sports car, just that it's more enjoyable to drive than the average crossover of this size. It comes standard with a turbocharged inline-four, unless you go for the much more expensive JCW model. A seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive are also standard. The only thing we're sad about is that the Countryman doesn't get the paddle shifters that can be found in the X1.\n\nThe Countryman is a fantastically balanced machine. When driven softly, you'll be amazed at how smooth and refined the ride is, with the crossover absorbing most bumps in the road with ease. Find a section of twisty road and put your foot down and you'll be equally impressed with how confidently agile it is. A maximum towing capacity of 3,500 pounds adds to the crossover's practicality as well.\n\nWhile not the most efficient car in this segment, the Countryman does pretty well given the fact that it's all-wheel drive and packed with a good amount of power. It does much better on the highway than it does in the city, as is usually the case with a turbocharged engine. The similarly equipped BMW X1 manages a combined rating of 28 miles per gallon, meaning the Countryman comes close.\n\u2022 Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go\n\nThe most important safety and driver assist features come standard in the Countryman. This includes things like a number of collision detection and avoidance systems. However, if you're looking to get adaptive cruise control with lane-centering, then you'll need to spring for the Driving Assistant Plus package.\n\nA design ideology centered around fun dominates every Mini. This is what makes them so instantly recognizable. On the inside of the Countryman, the fun continues in a way that doesn't feel kitsch. Compared to the iconic Cooper, the Countryman is a lot more practical, with more space for passengers and cargo as well.\n\nThe Countryman is much more spacious on the inside than you'd expect from a Mini. Those in the front seats are spoiled, with plenty of room to stretch out. The design of the dashboard also makes the whole cabin feel roomier. While those in the back don't get as much legroom, most will find it more than comfortable enough. Cargo capacity is also reasonably spacious.\n\nWe love that Mini keeps away from the minimalism that has infected most other luxury brands. The cabin has a lot of character, with fabric covering most panels, creating a stippling effect. LEDs shine from behind the fabric, changing based on your selected drive mode. There are plenty of comfort features available in the Countryman, including automatic climate control, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and power-adjustable seats with lumbar support.\n\nKey to the Mini's quirky identity is its infotainment screen. Rather than using a traditional two-screen setup for the gauge cluster and the infotainment system, a single circular 9.4-inch screen is mounted to the center of the dashboard. The panel is an OLED and responds quickly and smoothly to inputs. You can change the themes of the screen, including being able to upload photos to use as a background. A heads-up display is standard, though.\n\nWireless Android Auto and Apple Carplay and standard features in the Countryman, as is a on-board Wi-Fi. There a USB slots in the front and the back, you also get a standard wireless smartphone charging pad. The standard sound system is good, but you can upgrade to a 12-speaker Harman Kardon system instead.",

      "text": "If you're looking to break into the luxury segment without spending a fortune, this stylish and surprisingly refined compact car is your best bet. As the most affordable new luxury car you can buy in 2025, it proves that premium doesn\u2019t have to mean pricey.\nIt blends distinctive European design, premium materials, and agile handling into a city-friendly package that\u2019s both fun to drive and easy to live with. Despite its small footprint, the interior feels upscale with available leather upholstery, intuitive tech, and refined finishes that rival more expensive competitors.\nThis isn\u2019t just an entry-level model with a luxury badge, it\u2019s a true premium vehicle that delivers charm, character, and value in equal measure. For 2025, luxury starts here.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed and the EPA.\nThe 2026 Mini Cooper Offers a Premium Experience at an Affordable Price\nThe Cooper hatchback is easily among the most iconic and instantly recognizable cars ever produced. For the 2025 model year, the hatch received an update that improved everything, from the styling to standard technology. While it isn't everyone's idea of a traditional luxury car, it comes loaded with plenty of premium elements that help it compete with cars priced much higher.\n2026 Trims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nCooper 2-Door |\n$30,675 |\n|\nCooper 4-Door |\n$31,675 |\n|\nCooper S 2-Door |\n$33,975 |\n|\nCooper S 4-Door |\n$34,975 |\n|\nCooper Convertible |\n$35,775 |\n|\nCooper S Convertible |\n$39,075 |\nThere is still a lot of customization on offer when building your new Mini Cooper, with the brand offering a two-door hardtop, a four-door hardtop, and a two-door convertible. These three body styles are offered either as the standard Cooper or the more powerful and engaging Cooper S. From that point on, you can choose from three trim levels, the Signature, Signature Plus, or Iconic.\nThis leaves you with a lot of choices to make, though. Once you've decided how many doors you want and whether or not you'd like to be able to drop the top, we'd recommend going for the Cooper S in the Signature Plus trim. Assuming you go with the two-door model, this would bring the price up to $35,200. It adds additional levels of customization as well as a driving assistant, sport seats, and wireless device charging.\nWarranties and Maintenance\n- Limited Warranty: Four Years or 50,000 Miles\n- Powertrain Warranty: Four Years or 50,000 Miles\n- Complimentary Maintenance: Three Years or 36,000 Miles\nMini is pretty competitive when it comes to its warranty packages. Whilst not mind-blowing, the bumper-to-bumper coverage is slightly better than average while the powertrain warranty is pretty standard. What is nice is the fact that Mini offers three years of complimentary maintenance. Other competitors like BMW and Volvo do match this offering, though.\nMini's Hatchback Feels More Comfortable and Upscale Than You'd Expect\nMini has always prided itself on being different and a little bit quirky. The new Cooper leans into this ideology, with a cabin that is different from just about anything else on the market. While its price tag is resonably low, the Cooper is much more upscale than you'd expect, though it is tight on passenger space.\nInterior Dimensions and Comfort\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n38.6 Inches |\n|---|---|\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n41.4 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n36.2 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n32.3 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity |\n13.1 Cubic Feet |\nAt the end of the day, the Mini Cooper is a small hatchback, which is something you should definitely remember before taking one home. Regardless of which body type you opt for, rear seat legroom is going to be pretty compromised. That being said, it does feel more spacious than its specifications suggest. Just note that the above table is for the four-door Cooper.\nIf you're someone who sticks to urban areas and doesn't often lift more than a single passenger, then the Cooper still has a ton to offer. Its interior is retro, with plenty of callbacks to the 1959 Mini. Tons of nice materials cover every surface, though, with a dashboard covered in soft fabrics. Behind the fabric are LED lighting elements that adjust based on a number of different factors.\nInfotainment and Technology\nA key part of the Mini Cooper's unique identity is linked to its infotainment screen. Rather than having two separate screens, one for the infotainment system and one for gauges, the Cooper has a single circular display which sits in the center of the dashboard. It features a number of different themes and can be adjusted based on your individual preferences. A heads-up display is standard, though, meaning all the info you need is still right in front of you.\nMini offers a plethora of other features in the Cooper hatchback. As mentioned before, wireless smartphone charging is available in addition to the USB ports in the cabin. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard features. If you opt for the top trim, you can also get a Harman Kardon sound system. When parked, the central screen can also be used to play single or multiplayer video games.\nThis Hatchback Remains a Fun and Engaging Car To Drive in 2025\nThe original Mini made a name for itself by being playful and fun, something that the current generation of the hatchback aims to continue. As well as having quirky exterior styling and a unique cabin, the Mini is an impressively enjoyable car to drive, particularly if you opt for the more powerful Cooper S.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n7-Speed Dual-Clutch |\n7-Speed Dual-Clutch |\n|\nHorsepower |\n161 HP |\n201 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n184 LB-FT |\n221 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD |\nFWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7.4 Seconds |\n5.8 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n130 MPH |\n150 MPH |\nDespite its pretty humble-looking figures, the Mini Cooper is an exceptionally perky car to drive. Both the Cooper and the Cooper S feature a turbocharged inline-four under the hood, but the S makes quite a bit more power. The S also makes 12 more horses than it did back in 2024 before its update. The manual transmission is now off the table, but a slick dual-clutch automatic is standard across the board.\nThe Mini Cooper is a torque-happy engine, willing to be pushed hard regardless of which model you opt for. While it has become quieter and a lot more refined than it used to be, the Cooper remains an athletic hatchback that is an absolute joy to drive through twisty sections of road.\nIf neither the Cooper or the Cooper S feel sporty enough for you, two-door models can get the JCW treatment. This pushes horsepower up to 228 and torque up to 280 pound-feet. It also gets a lot of other performance upgrades that help it feel more focused, such as Brembo brakes, an electronically locking differential, and a unique suspension tune.\nFuel Economy\n|\nModel |\nCity |\nHighway |\nCombined |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nMini Cooper |\n28 MPG |\n39 MPG |\n32 MPG |\n|\nMini Cooper S |\n28 MPG |\n39 MPG |\n32 MPG |\n|\nMini Cooper Convertible |\n27 MPG |\n37 MPG |\n30 MPG |\n|\nMini Cooper S Convertible |\n26 MPG |\n36 MPG |\n30 MPG |\nFor a gas-only car that is as peppy as the Cooper is, Mini's hatchback is impressively efficient. Whether you opt for the two-door model or the four-door model, it achieves the same 32 miles per gallon combined. There is also no penalty for opting for the more powerful S model, which achieves the same fuel economy in hardtop form.\nThe convertible model, however, is where you see the Mini start to lose some efficiency. The change isn't drastic, though, with the biggest losses incurred during highway driving. The Cooper S with the drop top does lose another mile per gallon over its non-S counterpart.\nSafety and Driver Assist Features\n- Front Collision Warning and Brake Intervention\n- Lane Departure Warning and Lane\u2011Keep Assist\n- Active Blind Spot Detection\n- Active Cruise Control with Stop\u2011and\u2011Go Function\n- Parking Assistant Plus\nMini loads their small hatchback with a ton of standard safety tech, including collision detection and avoidance systems, blind spot monitoring, and systems that keep you from drifting out of your lane. As well as features like adaptive cruise control, you can also get Parking Assistant Plus, which parks your car for you using a number of different cameras and sensors."

      "text": "When you\u2019re a buyer on a budget, there are a seemingly endless number of things that you have to consider when looking for a new car. Small crossovers, however, seem to tick a lot of boxes, delivering practicality, comfort, and affordable running costs, all at a price that is bearable.\nSmall crossovers are some of the most popular vehicles on the road, and for good reason. For those that simply want more interior space and ground clearance than a sedan, they easily get the job done. There are also a lot of options out there that keep the savings rolling by being super affordable to keep running.\nWe\u2019ve found ten small crossovers that deliver on their practicality promises with spacious interiors for both passengers and cargo. These ten crossovers also feature running costs that are well below average for their segments. We outline how much you can expect to pay in maintenance as well as how much interior room you and your passengers will have.\nIn compiling this article, we have cross-referenced information for vehicle reliability, maintenance, and pricing from sources like TopSpeed, J.D. Power, Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, RepairPal, CarEdge, and Consumer Reports to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible. Please note that we have ranked the following models in descending order, with the most affordable model holding the number one spot.\n10 2025 MINI Countryman\nMaintenance Costs Over Ten Years: $7,630\nWhile MINI is traditionally known for making, well, mini cars, the Countryman extends the brand's lineup into the compact crossover segment. This small luxury SUV comes packed with technology and plenty of comfort features, with some very distinct elements that remind you what brand of car you're driving.\nOwnership Costs\nDespite existing within the luxury segment, the Mini Countryman isn't a particularly expensive car to keep in good condition. Along with offering complimentary maintenance for three years or 36,000 miles, maintenance costs are generally low for its segment.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: $880 (RepairPal)\n- Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $7,630 (CarEdge)\n- Recalls: 3\n- Worst Countryman Year To Buy Used: 2012\nInterior Dimensions\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n40.7 Inches |\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n40.4 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n37.4 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n37 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity Behind Second Row |\n25 Cubic Feet |\n9 2025 Mazda CX-30\nMaintenance Costs Over Ten Years: $7,600\nMazda has put significant effort into upscaling their brand, aiming to be somewhat of an entry-level luxury option. The CX-30 demonstrates how successful they've been with this approach. With premium styling inside and out and plenty of features for the money you pay, it really does offer tons of value.\nOwnership Costs\nMazda may be moving up in the world, but the cost of owning one of their vehicles has stayed pretty stagnant, which is fantastic. The CX-30, in particular, costs much less than the average SUV to maintain. The only downside is that Mazda doesn't offer any complimentary maintenance as it stands.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: N/A (RepairPal)\n- Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $7,600 (CarEdge)\n- Recalls: 0\n- Worst CX-30 Year To Buy Used: 2021\nInterior Dimensions\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n38.1 Inches |\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n41.7 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n38.3 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n36.3 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity Behind Second Row |\n20.2 Cubic Feet |\n8 2025 Nissan Kicks\nMaintenance Costs Over Ten Years: $7,569\nNissan has completely revitalized the Kicks for the 2025 model year, with it entering a brand-new generation. Despite all the changes, it hasn't abandoned its fun personality, which made it such an attractive option in the past. It has matured, though, becoming more refined and more comfortable.\nReliability\nNissan may not necessarily always be associated with low running costs, but the Kicks proves that the brand still has some offerings for those on a budget. Part of its ideology is that it keeps things affordable, which is why maintenance costs are so low. Nissan also offers complimentary maintenance for the first two years or 24,000 miles.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: N/A (RepairPal)\n- Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $7,569 (CarEdge)\n- Recalls: 1\n- Worst Kicks Year To Buy Used: 2019\nInterior Dimensions\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n39.7 Inches |\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n42.7 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n38.5 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n34.5 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity Behind Second Row |\n30 Cubic Feet |\n7 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander\nMaintenance Costs Over Ten Years: $7,519\nMitsubishi's presence in North America is not what it once was, but the Outlander easily keeps the brand alive on its own. It has been refreshed for 2025, with updated styling and a plethora of new features. It is also the only 2025 compact crossover to come standard with three rows of seats.\nOwnership Costs\nWhile the Mitsubishi name doesn't carry a ton of clout on its own, the Outlander stands out as an affordable option that doesn't cost a lot to keep running. Along with a two-year, 24,000-mile complimentary maintenance plan, the Japanese brand also offers the longest powertrain warranty in North America at 10 years or 100,000 miles.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: $519 (RepairPal)\n- Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $7,519 (CarEdge)\n- Recalls: 0\n- Worst Outlander Year To Buy Used: 2015\nInterior Dimensions\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n40.6 Inches |\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n41.7 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n39.1 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n39.9 Inches |\n|\nThird Row Headroom |\n34.5 Inches |\n|\nThird Row Legroom |\n18.7 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity Behind Second Row |\n30.6 Cubic Feet |\n6 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport\nMaintenance Costs Over Ten Years: $7,404\nIt seems strange to us that Mitsubishi would decide to market this crossover as the Outlander Sport when it has very little in common with the Outlander, especially considering it is called the ASX almost everywhere else. This subcompact SUV follows the same ideology as the Mitsubishi Mirage, to keep things as cheap as humanly possible.\nOwnership Costs\nKeeping ownership costs low isn't a supremely difficult task when you use cheap materials throughout, including powering the crossover with an under-powered engine. The Outlander Sport features the same maintenance plan and long warranties as the regular Outlander.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: $498 (RepairPal)\n- Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $7,404 (CarEdge)\n- Recalls: 0\n- Worst Outlander Sport Year To Buy Used: 2015\nInterior Dimensions\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n39.4 Inches |\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n41.6 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n37.9 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n36.3 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity Behind Second Row |\n21.7 Cubic Feet |\n5 2025 Honda CR-V\nMaintenance Costs Over Ten Years: $7,367\nIf value for money is what you're after, then the CR-V is one of the best options in the compact segment. Honda has really hit it out of the park with this generation of the crossover, offering tons of practicality and space as well as an excellent list of standard features whether you opt for the gas or hybrid model.\nOwnership Costs\nHonda is pretty well known for building cars that are both reliable and cheap to maintain. The CR-V is no exception, sitting well below average when we look at predicted maintenance costs. Honda also offers a year of complimentary maintenance, or 12,000 miles.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: $407 (RepairPal)\n- Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $7,367 (CarEdge)\n- Recalls: 1\n- Worst CR-V Year To Buy Used: 2018\nInterior Dimensions\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n40 Inches |\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n41.3 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n38.2 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n41 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity Behind Second Row |\n39.3 Cubic Feet |\n4 2025 Honda HR-V\nMaintenance Costs Over Ten Years: $7,226\nIf the CR-V is a proposition that excites you, but you don't want to spend that much on a new car, then you can instead opt for the slightly smaller HR-V. We say slightly smaller as space for passengers doesn't differ as drastically as you'd expect, with the HR-V delivering a fantastic cabin.\nOwnership Costs\nThe HR-V is smaller and simpler than the CR-V, which is why it makes sense that the subcompact crossover would be slightly more affordable to maintain. Honda offers the same maintenance and warranty package on the HR-V as it does on its bigger compact SUV.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: $301 (RepairPal)\n- Est.

While many people like to dunk on it, its fun-loving attitude has certainly grown on us. This is helped plenty by the fact that its boxy exterior design helps it feel incredibly spacious on the inside.\nOwnership Costs\nThe Kia Soul is essentially the modern version of a hatchback, cramming tons of practicality into a seemingly small design. One of the benefits of this is that it is engineered pretty simply. Kia doesn't offer any complimentary maintenance to keep running costs low, but its 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty will certainly give you some peace of mind.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: $437 (RepairPal)\n- Est.

In multiple countries around the world, it sits among some of the best-selling vehicles. If only they could fix the build quality issues.\nOwnership Costs\nElectric vehicles are estimated to be cheaper to run than most gas-powered vehicles and more reliable. However, there aren't many EVs that have been around long enough and in large enough numbers to provide tons of reliable data. The Model Y, however, has been around for some time and shows that this sentiment could definitely be true.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: N/A (RepairPal)\n- Est.

The RAV4 basically invented the compact crossover segment as it exists today by offering utility and practicality above all else, forgoing any kind of gimmicks.\nOwnership Costs\nToyota is legendary for being able to keep maintenance costs way lower than any of its competitors. This is obvious with the RAV4 which is much cheaper to maintain than the other gas-powered cars on this list. Toyota also offers a two-year, 25,000-mile complimentary maintenance plan.\n- Average Yearly Maintenance Cost: $429(RepairPal)\n- Est.

      "text": "Any Mini owner will tell you that a good Mini must adhere to a strict set of rules. The first, of course, being its size. No, the 2025 Mini Countryman is no longer mini. By any standard, it's properly large, fitting in the compact category of SUVs rather than the subcompact one where Mini slots it. But that's because the entire industry has moved upwards in size, forcing carmakers to push the boundaries of the traditional sizing model.\nSo, while Mini has actually shrunk the overall length of its flagship Cooper, it did the complete opposite with the Countryman, stretching it to dimensions never before seen by this brand. Has this killed the Countryman's charming qualities? Actually, no.\n2025 Mini Countryman S\nFor its third generation, the Mini Countryman is larger than ever, defying Mini's core ethos of being cute and small. But that actually helps the Countryman remain competitive in the premium sub-compact crossover space. With peppy performance, spunky handling and BMW's expected build quality, the Countryman, especially in its sportier S form, is both practical and fun to drive.\n- Fun and cheerful looks.\n- Spacious and practical.\n- Quick and fun to drive.\n- No longer looks like a Mini.\n- No longer sized like a Mini.\n- Can quickly get expensive.\nThe Countryman S pictured here belongs to the BMW Canada press office. The vehicle was picked up clean and with a full tank of gas. For detailed insight into testing procedures and data collection, please review our methodology policy.\n2025 Mini Countryman S Exterior: A Clear Departure From Its Predecessor\n|\nStrengths |\nWeaknesses |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nSay what you will about the fact that Mini launched an SUV with the Countryman, it worked for the brand. Sure, Mini only sells about 15,000 of these things in the U.S. and Canada each year, but sales have been steady. The Countryman has also been consistently outselling BMW's own X2 in the U.S., so it only makes sense to see BMW green-lighting a third-generation for this thing, which is all new for the 2025 model year.\nIt looks...interesting. I don't know whether I should like this or not. The Countryman sure carries with it the cute, fun and energetic Mini vibe that defines the brand, but its styling doesn't really evoke anything from Mini's past. Then again, the Countryman really only exists to keep the Mini brand alive in North America, so I can see why the designers had a bit of fun with it.\nIn this S spec - which is halfway between the standard model and the full-fat John Cooper Works (JCW) - the Countryman does at least look fun and purposeful, kind of like a running shoe. There are neat design details like the added bronze tint around the grille, wheels, side blades and even on the roof. A part of that roof droops down aft of the C pillar with the ALL4 logo, breaking up the otherwise station wagon-like greenhouse. It didn't need to be there, but it does add character to this design. Above all, the Countryman S looks rugged and ready for adventure. It looks like it's already having fun even when it's parked, which is precisely what you want from a Mini.\nExterior Dimensions 2025 Versus 2024\n|\nModel Year 2025 |\nModel Year 2024 |\n|\n|\nLength |\n174.9 in |\n169.7 in |\n|\nWidth (With Mirrors) |\n72.6 in |\n71.7 in |\n|\nHeight |\n65.2 in |\n61.3 in |\n|\nWheelbase |\n106 in |\n105.1 in |\n|\nFront Track |\n62.0 in |\n61.6 in |\n|\nRear Track |\n62.0 in |\n61.7 in |\n|\nCurb Weight |\n3,777 lb |\n3,618 lb |\n2025 Mini Countryman S: Differences Between The U.S. And Canadian Market\nIn both markets, Mini sells essentially the same Countryman S with the same powertrain. And in both cases, the vehicle comes standard with all-wheel drive. There's also roughly the same level of customization options. The only main difference is what Mini calls the available trim packages for the S model. In the U.S., you have the choice between Signature Plus and Iconic, while in Canada, the Countryman S can be had in Premier or Premier + trims.\nU.S. Versus Canada Lineup Breakdown (model tested in bold)\n|\nU.S. Market |\nCanadian Market |\n|\nCountryman S Signature Plus ($38,900 USD) |\nCountryman S Premier ($45,590 CAD) |\n|\nCountryman S Iconic ($42,100 USD) |\nCountryman S Premier + ($49,590 CAD) |\nDriving Impressions And Performance: Punchy Acceleration, Fantastic Steering\nThe second core Mini rule is how fun the car is to drive. I was a huge fan of the last-generation Countryman because while it was an overblown Mini Cooper with all-wheel drive, it remained immensely fun to toss around in corners and legitimately quick off the line in its sportier S and JCW versions.\nAnd none of this has been lost with this new model. Underneath its body is essentially the same hardware as before. It still rides on BMW's UKL2 transverse architecture shared with the BMW X1 and X2 crossovers, and it's still powered by the same turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (BMW's B48). But it sees a significant bump in output to 241 horsepower (from 189 hp) and 295 lb-ft of torque (from 206 lb-ft).\nSure, the new Countryman S weighs 160 pounds more than its predecessor, but it picks itself up quickly and with the same sort of vigor you'd expect from BMW's M-rated small crossovers, sprinting to 60 MPH in six seconds flat, or about the same as a Golf GTI. As a matter of fact, this is almost as quick as the last-generation JCW. Punch the accelerator pedal and this four-cylinder is surprisingly strong in the low ends of the powerband, providing a good amount of torque, getting this bred box going quickly.\nYes, there's pumped in audio during the process, but it simply adds charm to the punchy powertrain. The chassis feels solid, sturdy and nimble in the corners, another defining Mini trait. The steering is heavy, precise and engaging to operate, and the all-wheel drive system kills the torque steer you normally find in the Cooper S. In every respect, this still drives like a Mini wearing an S badge.\nThere are, however, a few frustrating bits about this powertrain that made me miss the old model. BMW ditched the eight-speed automatic transmission for a new seven-speed dual-clutch unit. On paper, a dual-clutch shifts faster than a conventional automatic, but in this specific application it somehow doesn't. Like in the Cooper S, this transmission is slow to react at times, refusing to do what you ask of it. It too often sticks to upper gears, or worse, it hangs onto revs when you don't need it to, turning the Countryman into a frantic and loud crossover in situations where you'd prefer it remained tame.\nBut perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this transmission is the total lack of a lever or paddle shifters to manually shift from one gear to the next. So you're stuck with Mini's programming. The old Countryman had a long gear lever that allowed you to shuffle between gears like in a rally car. It made the driving experience fun as heck. But that's all in the past now.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder |\n|\nTransmission |\n7-Speed Dual Clutch Automatic |\n|\nDriveline |\nAWD |\n|\nHorsepower |\n241 HP @ 4,500 RPM |\n|\nTorque |\n295 LB-FT @ 1,500 RPM |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n6.0 Seconds |\n|\nTowing Capacity |\n3,500 LB |\n2025 Mini Countryman S Fuel Consumption\nThe EPA rates the Countryman S ALL4 at a decent 27 MPG combined, which is actually a hair under its predecessor. Over 300 miles and a full week with the Countryman S in October, while having a bit of fun with the throttle in the process, I averaged 26 MPG. That's totally acceptable for a vehicle of this size and weight that does not use hybrid technology.\nEPA And As Tested Fuel Consumption\n|\nCity |\nHighway |\nCombined |\n|\n|\nEPA Fuel Consumption |\n24 MPG |\n32 MPG |\n27 MPG |\n|\nFuel Consumption As Tested |\nNA |\nNA |\n26 MPG |\nInterior Design And Comfort: Roomy And Beautifully Styled\n|\nStrengths |\nWeaknesses |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nThe third Mini rule is that a Mini's cabin must be all about styling. It must also be built like a BMW, feeling like a premium item inside. And boy does this new one hit the hammer right on the head.\nLike in the Cooper, there's a clever use of materials and color combinations here that truly makes the experience of sitting inside a Countryman a special one. The dashboard, door cards and even the center console - which is actually a large pencil case - are covered in this warm and attractive wool-like texture. There's a slick motif on the door cards that goes from blue to brown (in my tester's case), and the blue Mini logo on the backrests uses a classic Mini font. It's all attractive and very inviting.\nIt's also supremely well put together. The level of quality and attention to detail is actually better than expected. Mini stays true to its circular infotainment system, which now houses more content than ever (more on that later). The Countryman's dashboard is minimalistic and uncluttered, which creates a non-intimidating and open space. There's also a neat shelf arrangement on the lower part of the center stack to stow various objects, including a wireless charging tray. It's all easy and well laid-out.\nThe Countryman's bloat obviously helps its rear passenger space. If its predecessor felt a little cramped back there, this new one will seat four tall adults comfortably. Legroom is adequate and headroom is never an issue. The increased width also slightly improved shoulder room back there.\nInterior Dimensions 2025 Versus 2024\n|\nFront (2025) |\nRear (2025) |\nFront (2024) |\nRear (2024) |\n|\n|\nHeadroom |\n40.7 in |\n37.4 in |\n40.5 in |\n38.3 in |\n|\nShoulder Room |\n55.7 in |\n54.8 in |\n54.8 in |\n54.0 in |\n|\nHip Room |\nNA |\nNA |\nNA |\nNA |\n|\nLegroom |\n40.4 in |\n37.0 in |\n40.4 in |\n37.6 in |\nTechnology And Ease Of Use: New Tech Inside Mini's Familiar Circular Screen\nMini was already cramming a lot of information into that central screen, but now there's even more happening. The Countryman also got rid of its steering-mounted gauge pod, which is a bit of a letdown. It was replaced by a heads-up-display.\nThe infotainment itself is very much like BMW's latest iDrive system as it shares the same basic hardware and interface. Mini simply dressed it up to look funkier, more playful and in tune with its products, but also completely ditched the old knob dial. That said, the Countryman - just like the Cooper - does a fantastic job of utilizing the circular and rather tight real estate. Icons and menus are presented in a carousel manner which you can navigate through using touch controls.\nThe system is fluid and reacts quickly. Drive modes were replaced by Experiences, which change the car's ambient lighting, infotainment theme, as well as the transmission's behavior and steering response. The voice command features are dealt with by a personal assistant presented as a cartoonish interpretation of a Mini. There are more fun features, too, like an onboard camera that both acts as theft prevention, but is also a way to grab snapshots with friends and family and share them on social media. And, no, it's not some form of data collection ploy, which I discovered when writing my dedicated piece on the matter:\nGenerally speaking, the technology in the 2025 Mini Countryman S is good and never tries to ruin your day, but like too many systems these days, it's so rich in content that doing simple tasks can take more time than if you just had a button instead. For instance, if you're not a fan of adaptive cruise control, you'll need to dig into the system to remove it each time. The same goes for most of the driving aid technology like lane keep assist.\nCargo And Storage Space: The New Dimensions Help\nLike passenger space, it's obvious that the new Countryman's increased size helps it in the cargo space department. You get a full seven cubes more than before from the trunk when the seats are in place. For reference, the Countryman now has more cargo space than a Mercedes-Benz GLA (15.4 cu-ft / 50.5 cu-ft).\n2025 Mini Countryman S Cargo Space Specifications Versus 2024\n|\nModel Year 2025 |\nModel Year 2024 |\n|\n|\nMinimum Cargo Space (With All Seats In Place) |\n25 cu-ft |\n17.6 cu-ft |\n|\nMaximum Cargo Space (With All Seats Lowered Flat) |\n56.2 cu-ft |\n47.6 cu-ft |\nThe BMW X1's Cooler, More Entertaining Cousin\nWhat's particularly interesting about the 2025 Mini Countryman is that, from a mechanical standpoint, it's closer than ever to its mechanical twin, the BMW X1. Yet, it feels more like a Mini than ever before.\nWhat Mini has achieved with this new model is creating a branding exercise like very few carmakers know how to do. After all, this is the essence of a Mini. We never really cared where their engines came from nor who provided the hardware. What we've always wanted from this brand were vehicles that take you out of the mundane, and manage to slap a grin on your face in the process. The fact that Mini has managed to do this with a vehicle as homogeneous as a crossover is a testament to the brand's ability to capitalize on styling and lifestyle. On paper, the Countryman is nothing more than a rebadged BMW X1. But it's the X1's cool cousin with whom you'd rather go out with for a drink."
