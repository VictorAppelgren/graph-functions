      "text": "Jenna Ortega will be back for a third run as the leading character in Netflix's hit Addams Family-inspired series. The streaming giant announced it has renewed Wednesday for a third season - just ahead of the show's return in August.\nWednesday, which first debuted on Netflix in November 2022, quickly became a global phenomenon. The series - which also stars stars prolific Puerto Rican film and TV actor Luis Guzm\u00e1n and Oscar-winning actress Catherine Zeta-Jones as Gomez and Morticia Addams - shattered records, becoming Netflix\u2019s most popular English language show of all time with over 252 million views in its first 91 days. It reached the number one spot in 90 countries and crossed the one billion hours viewed mark just three weeks after its release.\n\"The undeniable impact of Wednesday resonated immediately with fans worldwide, driving it to the top of our charts as our most popular English language TV show, and sparking cultural trends,\" said Bela Bajaria, Netflix's Chief Content Officer. \"We are so proud of Al Gough, Miles Millar, Tim Burton, Jenna Ortega, and the entire Wednesday cast and crew for everything they've accomplished.\"\nSeason 1 stayed at the #1 spot of the Netflix Global Top 10 for six consecutive weeks after its release, still a record for an English TV show on the platform. Additionally, the show's first season broke the record for the most-viewed in a week for an English language TV series on Netflix twice in back-to-back weeks.\nThe appeal of the supernatural dramedy series continues to grow, with Season 2 becoming one of the most anticipated new Netflix titles of 2025 with more than 2.8 billion social impressions to date.\nCreators, writers, and showrunners Alfred Gough and Miles Millar expressed their excitement about the renewal in Wednesday fashion:\n\"It\u2019s been a dark delight to watch Wednesday cast her spell over audiences across the globe - one deadpan quip at a time. We're beyond thrilled she'll be returning to stalk the halls of Nevermore in Season 3. This time, she'll unearth more of the school's sinister secrets - and descend even deeper into the Addams family crypt. Or, as Wednesday would say: 'Nothing brings a family together like a good exhumation.'\"\nSeason 2 will arrive in two parts, with the first four episodes dropping on August 6, 2025, and the remaining four on September 3, 2025.\nOrtega\u2019s razor-sharp wit and deadpan charm as Wednesday Addams promises to continue building upon the upcoming season\u2019s darkly comedic, supernatural mayhem that made the show a hit as she sees the line between her school and family life not just blur - it gets \"hacked to pieces,\" teased director and executive producer Tim Burton, hinting at even more Addams family drama on campus.\nThe new season is packed with star power, including a guest appearance by Lady Gaga in Part 2. The music superstar will play Rosaline Rotwood, a legendary and enigmatic Nevermore teacher who crosses paths with Wednesday. The season will also introduce viewers to new characters as Wednesday navigates family, friends and old adversaries while tackling a new bone-chilling supernatural mystery.\nDetails about Season 3's plot, casting and production timeline remain under wraps. But the early renewal signals Netflix's confidence in the franchise's continued success and cultural relevance."
