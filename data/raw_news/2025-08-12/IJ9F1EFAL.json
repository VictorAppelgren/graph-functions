  "content": "Welcome to the 11th edition of The Athletic\u2019s Transfer DealSheet for the summer 2025 transfer window.\n\nOur team of dedicated writers, including David Ornstein, will take you inside the market to explain the deals being worked on. The transfer window is open and will run until September 1.\n\nThe information found within this article has been gathered according to The Athletic\u2019s sourcing guidelines. Unless stated, our reporters have spoken to more than one person briefed on each deal before offering the clubs involved the opportunity to comment. Their responses, when they were given, have been included.\n\nWe aim to bring you analysis you can trust about what is happening at Europe\u2019s leading clubs and the latest information we\u2019re hearing from across the market. This year, The Athletic\u2019s football finance writer, Chris Weatherspoon, will be adding to our analysis of the transfer market. Our Manchester City reporter Jordan Campbell will return with the latest from the club next week.\n\nLast week, we looked at the striker high among the options left on the market, a possible deal for an Arsenal midfielder, and the latest on Benjamin Sesko before he joined Manchester United. This week, David Ornstein gives us his One To Watch, we have news on Liverpool interest in a young defender and the latest on Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nThis article is long but detailed, so enjoy it all \u2014 or search for the club or player you want to read about.\n\nWhen supporters are awaiting Newcastle United\u2019s line-up to face Aston Villa on Saturday, a burning question will be what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Alexander Isak might occupy for Eddie Howe\u2019s team.\n\nIsak has not featured in pre-season amid Liverpool\u2019s ongoing pursuit, and while Newcastle have stressed they have no intention of allowing a sale, potential replacements continue to be explored.\n\nThe anticipation is that Isak will miss the trip to Villa Park, with his future shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nBased on conversations with sources privy to the matter, The Athletic understands Isak is adamant he will never represent Newcastle again.\n\nEven if they refuse to sell the 25-year-old Sweden striker and he remains on Tyneside when the transfer window closes, Isak regards his career at St James\u2019s Park as finished and has no desire to reintegrate into the squad.\n\nIsak\u2019s perspective is that after being informed last summer that a new contract would not yet be offered to him \u2014 because of Newcastle\u2019s need to comply with football\u2019s financial rules and Isak already having a lucrative deal until 2028 \u2014 he made clear it would be his last campaign with the club.\n\nSome at Newcastle deny this was expressed and believe the forward planned to discuss the situation, including the possibility of fresh terms, once 2024-25 concluded.\n\nIsak helped his side win the Carabao Cup and qualify for the Champions League. Two weeks before the season ended, he told Howe of his wish to leave and reiterated this on a call to the manager before flying to Sweden after a final-day defeat by Everton.\n\nLiverpool are yet to make another offer since their \u00a3110million bid at the beginning of August was turned down. Newcastle\u2019s stance may soften if a proposal closer to \u00a3150m arrives and they can fill Isak\u2019s void through the market.\n\nThe Premier League champions\u2019 interest remains firm, and Isak is focused on a move to Anfield.\n\nKeep an eye on Ramsey\u2026\n\nAnother situation to keep an eye on as the transfer window enters its final few weeks involves Aston Villa midfielder Jacob Ramsey.\n\nThe 24-year-old is now in the final 24 months of his Villa contract, and despite several offers to extend, no agreement has been reached.\n\nIn such circumstances, both parties are open-minded about finding an alternative solution, and that is likely to mean a sale.\n\nThis would avoid further limbo, allowing Villa to plan ahead with more clarity and Ramsey the opportunity to achieve greater career stability.\n\nMany suitors have expressed an interest to Ramsey\u2019s camp, but emerging as his preferred destination are Newcastle United.\n\nThe Tyneside club made an approach for the former England youth international in January 2024, and boss Eddie Howe is a big fan.\n\nOther sides from the Premier League and abroad are also keen, including West Ham United. Their head coach Graham Potter admires Ramsey, and the feeling is mutual.\n\nHowever, Newcastle\u2019s project and the chance to work under Howe are thought to carry the greatest appeal.\n\nBefore opening their seasons in Saturday\u2019s lunchtime kick-off at Villa Park, Newcastle and Villa are starting talks to explore whether a compromise can be reached.\n\nRamsey is a priority target as Newcastle aim to strengthen in his position \u2014 and up front \u2014 amid what has been a testing market.\n\nA number of ambitious options have moved elsewhere, but they have landed Anthony Elanga and Aaron Ramsdale, while a deal for Malick Thiaw is close to being completed.\n\nManchester United are continuing to explore whether a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba can be agreed this summer.\n\nThe talks, taking place via intermediaries on United\u2019s behalf, have so far been to assess his willingness to join and the salary required \u2014 plus Brighton\u2019s potential valuation.\n\nBrighton do not intend to sell the 21-year-old in this market, preferring to keep him for at least another season, and have not indicated a price so far.\n\nBut United are determined to reshape Ruben Amorim\u2019s squad as much as possible in his first summer transfer window, and adding a top-level No 6 has been central to the club\u2019s plans.\n\nBaleba heads their list of targets, having impressed greatly during his two campaigns in the Premier League. He also has seven caps for the Cameroon national team.\n\nCompetition in 2026 is set to be fierce, so United are studying the parameters of a deal now, in case it is viable and Brighton\u2019s resolve can be put to the test.\n\nEqually, United will hope Brighton consider whether now might be the best time to cash in, given the inherent insecurities of football.\n\nBaleba \u2014 whose contract runs until 2028 with an option to extend by a further 12 months \u2014 is keen on the possibility of a switch to United, and personal terms would not be a problem.\n\nA number of United players have been in contact with Baleba about a transfer to Old Trafford, explaining the current landscape and ambitions.\n\nThe cost of any transaction would be a significant hurdle to overcome, though, and for this reason, some at United remain sceptical about the chances of an agreement being reached.\n\nIn 2023, Brighton sold Moises Caicedo to Chelsea for \u00a3100million rising to \u00a3115m, and Baleba is regarded in a similar category.\n\nAnother point of reference may be Joao Pedro, who Brighton recently traded to Chelsea for \u00a360m. Pedro was omitted for the final two games of last season after a training ground altercation with Jan Paul van Hecke.\n\nUnited are not expected to submit a bid for Baleba unless they believe there is a chance of success, with indirect conversations ongoing. Their signings so far have come in at the \u00a360million to \u00a370m range.\n\nUnited do need sales to balance the books after committing to more than \u00a3200m on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund are available and could raise significant funds.\n\nGiving United a degree of flexibility on cash is an extension to their revolving credit facility, plus sell-on clauses being realised for Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Carreras primarily, as well as Marcus Rashford\u2019s salary being off the wage bill.\n\nFurthermore, United included a significant sell-on clause in the deal agreed with Marseille for Mason Greenwood, who has attracted interest this window.\n\nShould United need, they can make sales in January and up to June 30 next summer to comply with PSR regulations for 2025-26.\n\u2022 Liverpool are interested in Parma centre-back Giovanni Leoni. They are trying to persuade the defender to move to Anfield this summer, but accept convincing him to leave Italy will be highly challenging. No clubs in Italy can afford him at this moment in time, with Milan going for Genoa\u2019s Koni De Winter as a result. The 18-year-old is highly rated and played 17 games for Parma in Serie A last season. Leoni has been capped seven times at Under-19 level by Italy. David Ornstein, James Horncastle and James Pearce\n\u2022 Gianluigi Donnarumma is willing to leave Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 but only for the right club and at the right moment. The goalkeeper is into the final year of his contract, and sources close to the player have indicated they expect him to leave. But he will not be forced out or made to accept an offer that he does not want. James Horncastle\n\u2022 Everton have agreed a deal to take Jack Grealish on loan from Manchester City. The deal still needs to be finalised but a medical was scheduled for Monday for the England international. An option to buy in the region of \u00a350milllion ($67.3m) will be included. David Ornstein and Gregg Evans\n\u2022 Chelsea forward Christopher Nkunku would be open to a return to RB Leipzig this summer if his former club\u2019s interest in a potential move advances. Nkunku has been the subject of enquiries from clubs in Germany, England and Italy this summer. Leipzig are among a number of sides interested in the 27-year-old, but have some financial reservations about the logistics of a potential deal given their need to keep their wage bill lower this season, having failed to secure European football for the 2025-26 campaign. Sebastian Stafford-Bloor\n\u2022 Al Nassr have reached an agreement in principle with Bayern Munich for Kingsley Coman. The deal for the winger is set to be between \u20ac25m and \u20ac30m. Coman will be Al Nassr\u2019s fifth permanent transfer of the summer, most recently securing the signing of centre-back Inigo Martinez from Barcelona for no fee. Meanwhile, Bayern have signed winger Luis Diaz from Liverpool on a \u20ac75million (\u00a365.6m; $88.1m) deal. Sebastian Stafford-Bloor\n\u2022 Nottingham Forest are close to a deal for Manchester City midfielder James McAtee. Nothing has been agreed at this stage but talks are moving in a positive direction. McAtee, 22, is available on a permanent transfer this summer and The Athletic reported in the DealSheet in July that he had attracted interest from England and Germany, with Nottingham Forest among his admirers. Paul Taylor\n\u2022 Newcastle United are advancing in negotiations to loan Odysseas Vlachodimos to Sevilla for the 2025-26 campaign. The 31-year-old goalkeeper joined for \u00a320million ($26.9m) from Nottingham Forest last summer, with Elliot Anderson moving in the opposite direction. Those deals came about due to Newcastle United\u2019s desperate need to comply with the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR) by June 30, 2024. Vlachodimos was not initially a target for Newcastle back then and does not feature in Eddie Howe\u2019s plans, having made a solitary substitute appearance against AFC Wimbledon in the Carabao Cup across 2024-25. Sevilla are looking to take Vlachodimos on a straight loan for the season, which does not contain an option or clause for the Spanish side to buy the Greece international, and Newcastle are set to pay the majority of his wages. Chris Waugh and Mario Cortegana\n\nHow much has each Premier League club spent so far this season?\n\nManchester United\u2019s signing of Benjamin Sesko over the weekend took their spend on transfer fees to just shy of \u00a3200m this summer and also elevated them as the highest spending Premier League club on a net basis. United have spent heavily on Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha without yet recouping a transfer fee in return; only Arsenal\u2019s \u00a3185.7m net spend comes close to that dispensed at Old Trafford so far this window.\n\nFor all the talk of Liverpool spending heavily \u2014 and they remain the highest spenders on a gross basis \u2014 five clubs have spent more on a net basis than their \u00a383.6m, per Transfermarkt. That cohort of five includes Sunderland, whose own summer splurging shows little sign of abating. They\u2019re expecting to complete the signing of Getafe centre-back Omar Alderete soon.\n\nLiverpool have offset their spending on new faces by selling well, with Darwin Nunez\u2019s departure for Saudi Arabia the latest example. The Anfield outfit have recouped nearly \u00a3170m in transfer fees this summer, a figure only usurped by perennial good sellers Chelsea. The latter are estimated to have now tipped over the \u00a3200m figure in sales, on the back of the twin departures of Lesley Ugochukwu and Armando Broja to newly promoted Burnley.\n\nIn turn, that put Burnley over the \u00a3100m barrier for new signings, making them one of eight Premier League clubs to hit nine-figures when it comes to transfer spending in the last couple of months.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, neither Crystal Palace nor Fulham are yet to spend much of anything, though nor have they been active sellers. Interestingly, the lowest spenders on a net basis are all clubs who competed to break into the top eight last season: Brighton & Hove Albion, Brentford, Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth have all taken in much more than they\u2019ve spent so far this summer.\n\nArsenal announced a new five-year contract for Ethan Nwaneri. Securing Nwaneri\u2019s future is excellent news for the club. Nwaneri had fielded interest from elsewhere in the Premier League and abroad, but his preference was always to find an agreement with Arsenal.\n\nOther than that, it has been relatively quiet: with the bulk of Arsenal\u2019s incoming transfer business done, the focus has been on preparing the current players for the start of the new season.\n\nIt\u2019s a week to the season \u2014 do Arsenal look ready?\n\nThey had their best performance of pre-season against Athletic Club, running out 3-0 winners thanks to goals from Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz.\n\nIt was an encouraging display, with familiar defensive solidity coupled with dynamic attacking. The likes of Gabriel, Riccardo Calafiori, Jurrien Timber and Havertz are also fit again, just in time for the new season.\n\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\n\nAsked after the win over Athletic whether Arsenal will add to the six signings they have already made, manager Mikel Arteta said: \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens in terms of where the squad is in the next few weeks, but we are actively looking at options.\n\n\u201cThere are a few players that have to leave as well, so we\u2019ll be open to see what happens.\u201d\n\nIf Arsenal are to make another addition, it is likely to be in the attacking part of the pitch. Arsenal have been studying candidates to improve their left wing options, but ideally, the club would like to make some sales before prioritising another arrival.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nA number of players who spent last season out on loan \u2014 the likes of Fabio Vieira, Karl Hein, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson \u2014 are available to leave the club before the transfer deadline on September 1. Vieira is the subject of talks between Arsenal and Stuttgart, while Fulham have held negotiations over Nelson\u2019s return. In both cases, Arsenal favour a permanent deal.\n\nOleksandr Zinchenko is also available to leave before the deadline, although the Ukraine international is giving consideration to seeing out the final year of his Arsenal contract and moving on a free transfer in 2026. Arsenal, naturally, would prefer a sale in this window.\n\nPolish international Jakub Kiwior is open to leaving for a club where he can be a regular starter. Arsenal are in no rush to sell, however, and none of the clubs tracking Kiwior have yet met their asking price.\n\nChelsea\u2019s steady stream of outgoings gathered pace. Marc Guiu completed a season-long loan move to Sunderland, while Everton signed Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for \u00a325m.\n\nBurnley also finalised the purchases of two unwanted Chelsea players in midfielder Ugochukwu and home-grown striker Broja, raising significant funds.\n\nChelsea stepped up talks to prise out-of-favour Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho from Old Trafford.\n\nOn the pitch, Chelsea won both of their pre-season friendlies impressively against Bayer Leverkusen and Milan. The optimistic glow around Stamford Bridge was dimmed a little by the news that defender Levi Colwill tore his ACL in training at Cobham and is expected to miss most of the season after undergoing surgery.\n\nNicolas Jackson was also left out of Enzo Maresca\u2019s squad for both matches as Chelsea and the striker explore a possible transfer in the final weeks of the summer window.\n\nColwill was fundamental to Chelsea\u2019s biggest achievements last season, playing twice as many minutes as any of Maresca\u2019s other centre-backs. His influence was huge both in and out of possession, so losing him to such a serious injury on the eve of the new season is a real blow to their aspirations.\n\nBut there is no sense of panic at Stamford Bridge, and Chelsea feel no urgent need to delve into the summer transfer market to replace him.\n\nThis is precisely why you amass the level of depth that they have over the last two-and-a-half years; even with Colwill sidelined, Chelsea still have as many as 10 senior players competing for four defensive positions. Maresca trusts Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo, and Wesley Fofana is nearing a return to full fitness. Summer signing Jorrel Hato is equally capable of playing at centre-back or left-back.\n\nBenoit Badiashile was regarded as a close to equivalent talent to Colwill, with a very similar profile, when he was acquired from Monaco in January 2023. Josh Acheampong won the love of Maresca in last season\u2019s Conference League campaign and looks ready to shoulder greater responsibility.\n\nThen there is Aaron Anselmino, who specialised in playing as the middle of three defenders in possession at Boca Juniors and could be kept around this season if Maresca deems him ready.\n\nChelsea are confident in their alternative options, and Colwill\u2019s unfortunate injury could prove exactly the kind of opportunity that one of his teammates has been waiting for.\n\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\n\nChelsea would still like to sign a winger and an attacking midfielder before the transfer window closes, and the names at the top of their wish list for each position are well known.\n\nGarnacho is the top choice for a right-footed left winger to compete with summer signing Jamie Gittens. Chelsea have stepped up talks in the wake of the Sesko deal and view the Argentine\u2019s situation at Old Trafford as an opportunity, but they are not inclined to simply meet Manchester United\u2019s valuation of the player.\n\nAs detailed by my colleague David Ornstein last week, Garnacho expects to join Chelsea and has ruled out all options other than moving to Stamford Bridge or staying at Old Trafford.\n\nAnother ongoing situation is that of Xavi Simons. Informal discussions have been held with Leipzig over a move for the Netherlands international, but no formal bid has been made.\n\nChelsea also like Aston Villa\u2019s Morgan Rogers as a potential fit for the attacking midfield role.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nSubstantial progress has been made in trimming Chelsea\u2019s player list, but there is more work to be done in the remainder of August.\n\nJackson and Christopher Nkunku were left out of Chelsea\u2019s pre-season friendlies against Leverkusen and Milan as they, their representatives and the club explore potential moves away.\n\nSenior sources at Stamford Bridge say that Jackson will be reintegrated into Maresca\u2019s squad after the deadline if no transfer materialises. Chelsea are not desperate to sell him but recognise that he may want to be the lead striker at another club, and are open to sanctioning a sale if the proposal satisfies all parties.\n\nThere is more confidence that Nkunku will depart; he is open to a return to Leipzig but is commanding interest from other Bundesliga sides as well as clubs in Italy and the Premier League.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch, Renato Veiga will not return to Chelsea\u2019s first team squad despite Colwill\u2019s injury and is expected to be sold for a substantial profit this summer.\n\nGarnacho\u2019s arrival would further limit Tyrique George\u2019s game time, and Chelsea will work with him and his representatives to find a club where he can play more regularly this season. That could be a loan or even a permanent sale if the proposal is right. A number of clubs in England and in Europe have expressed interest.\n\nChelsea are still working on the departures of Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka and Axel Disasi. Alfie Gilchrist is expected to be sold to a Championship club before the transfer deadline on September 1.\n\nLiverpool completed the sale of striker Darwin Nunez to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal for an initial fee of \u20ac53m. It brought to an end the erratic Uruguayan\u2019s three-year stay at Anfield. The Premier League champions believe that once achievable add-ons are triggered, the deal will ultimately be worth around \u20ac65m to them.\n\nYoung midfielder Tyler Morton joined French club Lyon in a \u20ac15m deal with Liverpool negotiating a 20 per cent sell-on clause.\n\nSenior Anfield figures dismissed reports that Liverpool were targeting PSG attacker Bradley Barcola. Liverpool believe bringing in a left-sided attacker with his profile would block the pathway for talented teenager Rio Ngumoha, who is now viewed as part of Arne Slot\u2019s senior squad after an impressive pre-season.\n\nDoes Nunez\u2019s exit free up funds for Isak?\n\nLiverpool had already bid \u00a3110m for Isak before selling Nunez, so it\u2019s not as if they have been relying on further outgoings to make their move for the Swedish striker.\n\nHowever, it certainly opens up a space in the squad and gives them more leeway financially. For all the talk about Liverpool\u2019s \u00a3300m spending spree so far this summer, sporting director Richard Hughes has also generated around \u00a3200m from sales when you include performance-related add-ons.\n\nLiverpool have the capacity to shatter the British transfer record for Isak without any concerns over PSR. But so far, there\u2019s no sign of Newcastle\u2019s \u2018not for sale\u2019 stance shifting. That\u2019s the reason why Liverpool have yet to table an improved bid for Isak.\n\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\n\nAs well as a centre-forward, Liverpool are also in the market for a centre-back, having yet to replace Jarell Quansah, who was sold to Bayer Leverkusen last month.\n\nWith Joe Gomez out with an Achilles injury, Slot only has two recognised senior centre-backs in Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate ahead of Friday\u2019s Premier League opener at home to Bournemouth.\n\nYoung Parma centre-back Giovanni Leoni is highly-regarded. Liverpool have also previously shown interest in Crystal Palace skipper Marc Guehi, who is down to the final year of his contract.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nHarvey Elliott has been attracting interest from Bundesliga outfit Leipzig, who view him as a potential replacement for Xavi Simons. Liverpool value Elliott at around \u00a350m.\n\nKostas Tsimikas was left out of Slot\u2019s squad for Sunday\u2019s Community Shield. Liverpool are open to sanctioning a permanent exit for the Greece international. Nottingham Forest are among the clubs to have shown interest.\n\nThe future of young winger Ben Doak is also unclear. Newly promoted Leeds United are one of a number of top-flight clubs keen on Doak, who is valued at around \u00a320m.\n\nLuca Stephenson is set to sign a new deal at Anfield and then head to Dundee United on a season-long loan.\n\nUnited sealed the transfer of Sesko, agreeing a fee with Leipzig of \u20ac76.5m plus \u20ac8.5m in add-ons. Sesko flew in on Thursday, completed his medical on Friday, signed his paperwork on Saturday and was presented to United fans on the pitch at Old Trafford ahead of the Fiorentina game.\n\nRasmus Hojlund was left as an unused substitute for United\u2019s final pre-season friendly, with Mason Mount preferred up front instead. Afterwards, Ruben Amorim said: \u201cIn some moments, I felt that we struggle without a reference as a striker. We have a new player, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAmorim declining to use Hojlund in the match, then neglecting to mention him afterwards, is a sign of the club\u2019s intentions to sell him.\n\nWith Sesko in, will transfer business slow down?\n\nThat would be the logical assessment. But United are taking a bold approach to this window, the first under INEOS rule, when the structure is established above a head coach of their choosing. Activity might even speed up.\n\nAmorim\u2019s desire to reshape his squad is clear, which is why United are exploring an ambitious move for Carlos Baleba. Talks continue on Brighton\u2019s willingness, or not, to entertain a sale. Amorim wants a dynamic No 6, who can stop attacks and link defence with the frontline.\n\nGoing the other way, bringing in money for Garnacho is a priority, and progress is being made on talks with Chelsea. Clubs such as Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Leipzig and Newcastle are taking a look at Hojlund, who at present insists he wants to stay and fight for his place.\n\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\n\nUnited remain in the market for a midfielder, with the pursuit of Baleba explained above. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants United to be capable of making a major impression this campaign, and signing a player of Baleba\u2019s quality would be expected to significantly aid those aims.\n\nThe goalkeeper position carries some intrigue, with United continuing to be linked with a new No 1. Donnarumma is the latest name, and he appears to be heading for the exit at PSG after they this week signed Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.\n\nAt 23, Chevalier is three years younger than Donnarumma, who has not agreed to a new contract. His current terms expire in 2026. United\u2019s stance on goalkeepers \u2014 since Aston Villa rejected their loan offer for Emiliano Martinez \u2014 is that a signing could only happen if Andre Onana departs, and there are no signs of that at present. Onana is hoping to be fit for the opening game of the Premier League against Arsenal on Sunday. A move for Donnarumma is not expected to materialise.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nAs well as Garnacho and Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.\n\nHarry Amass, who was left out of United\u2019s tour to the U.S. is attracting loan interest from several clubs from the Championship and Europe, with around 15 suitors in touch. Game time will be the main factor in selecting his club.\n\nYou mean aside from Eddie Howe fielding an inordinate number of questions about Alexander Isak\u2019s future? (Apologies, but there will be more on Isak later).\n\nWell, Sesko, the striker, has become the latest player to turn down Newcastle in favour of a move to Manchester United \u2014 an eventuality some inside St James\u2019 Park had feared from the start of that ambitious pursuit \u2014 while long-serving goalkeeper Martin Dubravka has joined Burnley permanently.\n\nMalick Thiaw, meanwhile, is close to being unveiled as the third senior signing of the summer, after Anthony Elanga and Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nThe 24-year-old Germany international centre-back underwent his medical on Monday, having flown to Tyneside on Sunday evening, and will join from Milan for an upfront fee of \u20ac35m (\u00a330.3m; $40.8m) alongside \u20ac5m (\u00a34.3m; $5.8m) in add-ons. Thiaw has been a long-term target, with Howe confirming that the defender was a player he admired during the summer of 2024, and his arrival means that Newcastle have finally reinforced at right-sided centre-back, something they have been aiming to do for three years.\n\nElsewhere, on the striker front, Newcastle remain in protracted talks to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford, though substantive progress has yet to be made, while Porto\u2019s Samu Aghehowa is among the alternative centre-forwards the club have discussed internally.\n\nWhat is the priority with a week to go until the season?\n\nSomewhat perversely, despite the cloud of negativity which has understandably loomed over Newcastle\u2019s summer, their window may yet end with the squad being significantly strengthened in all the areas the club hoped to.\n\nThat remains a big if for now, however, given that goals are a massive concern and Isak was missing in action throughout the whole of Newcastle\u2019s (winless) pre-season friendly campaign. My colleague David Ornstein explained further on Isak\u2019s future above, and the striker\u2019s perspective, but it is clear that reintegrating him would be a huge task.\n\nHowe admitted on Friday that it is \u201cclear I can\u2019t involve\u201d Isak at the moment, while insisting that striker \u201chas a future\u201d at St James\u2019. The head coach has managed the situation delicately, stressing that he can only work with players who \u201cwant\u201d to play for the club, and at the same time refusing to overtly criticise Isak.\n\nLiverpool have yet to return since seeing a \u00a3110m bid rejected at the start of this month, and Newcastle remain adamant, from the boardroom down, that Isak is not for sale. That message, which continues to be repeated, is only likely to soften if Newcastle sign two strikers and Liverpool offer a fee close to \u00a3150m.\n\nAs things stand, those two eventualities appear unlikely, which means the priority has to be on bringing in a replacement for Callum Wilson. Howe will also be hoping that he can use all of his man-management skills to coax Isak back around so that the Sweden international leads the line for the majority of the 2025-26 season, even if it he is set to miss the start of the campaign. Whether or not that is possible remains to be seen.\n\nWissa would be the ideal replacement for Wilson, but Brentford will not sell until they sign a replacement and, even then, Newcastle have to agree a fee and will not overpay for a player who turns 29 next month. While Aghehowa has been watched and is liked, he is only 21, and a deal would be complicated and expensive. Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 Jorgen Strand Larsen has also been considered, though his club do not deem the striker to be for sale.\n\nNewcastle are actively pursuing alternatives in case the Wissa deal does not happen, though they are running out of time, and so Anthony Gordon is set to lead the line as a makeshift centre-forward against Aston Villa on Saturday.\n\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\n\nBeyond centre-forward, which is clearly their most pressing need, Howe ideally wants to sign another midfielder following Sean Longstaff\u2019s departure to Leeds United last month. Joe Willock is also suffering from a calf injury, which is set to keep him out for another month.\n\nAlthough Howe has an elite first-choice midfield of Joelinton, Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimaraes, and an exciting prospect as back-up in Lewis Miley, alongside Willock, the head coach likes to operate with six options, given he usually starts with three of them. Given the additional demands of Champions League football, another midfielder is required.\n\nIdeally, an attacking midfielder in the No 8 mould would arrive. West Ham United\u2019s Lucas Paqueta is unlikely to be that addition, despite being linked, with Newcastle focusing on options elsewhere. As mentioned by my colleague David Ornstein, Newcastle are emerging as Jacob Ramsey\u2019s preferred destination.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nThere\u2019s a player whose name begins with \u201cI\u201d who you may have heard wants to leave, though Newcastle remain steadfast that Isak can and will be reintegrated, rather than join Liverpool.\n\nElsewhere, as The Athletic reported on Monday, Odysseas Vlachodimos is set to join Sevilla on a season-long loan. The Greece international made only one substitute appearance last season, and Newcastle are due to cover the majority of his wages. The framework of the deal being discussed does not include an option or obligation to buy and is just a straight loan.\n\nNewcastle would not stand in the way of full-backs Matt Targett or Harrison Ashby leaving.\n\nAs Isak\u2019s situation shows, Newcastle cannot take anything for granted, but they are determined to hold on to their other prize assets, Tonali, Guimaraes, Gordon and Tino Livramento.\n\nThere were two big developments at Tottenham last week, both of them largely known in advance from the end of the Asia tour.\n\nFirstly, Son Heung-min\u2019s departure was confirmed, to LAFC in MLS, after 10 years at Tottenham. He said some emotional goodbyes to the Spurs fans and is now already playing for his new club.\n\nSecondly, the club confirmed the news that James Maddison ruptured his ACL and would need knee surgery. Beyond that, there have been no more arrivals since Joao Palhinha\u2019s loan from Bayern Munich was confirmed.\n\nThere have been other departures, specifically of young players going out on loan: Alfie Devine to Preston North End, Portsmouth for Yang Min-hyeok, Oxford United for Will Lankshear, Stoke City for Jamie Donley, Wycombe Wanderers for George Abbott and Notts County for Tyrese Hall.\n\nMikey Moore, who is on loan at Rangers, also signed a new long-term contract.\n\nSpurs travelled to Bayern Munich for a pre-season friendly on Thursday and lost 4-0.\n\nIs replacing Maddison now the priority?\n\nThomas Frank admitted in Munich last week that yes, Tottenham will be looking for players who can help to cover for Maddison following his knee injury. \u201cWe are definitely in the market in general,\u201d Frank said. \u201cOf course, when players get a long-term injury, we need to look into that.\u201d\n\nMaddison will miss much of this season after knee surgery, while Dejan Kulusevski, who had knee surgery of his own in May, will also miss the start of the season. \u201cOut for a long time\u201d is how Frank put it.\n\nSo Tottenham clearly need creative quality in attacking midfield before the start of the season. They have plenty of solidity in the middle of the pitch, especially after adding Palhinha this window.\n\nAnd they have plenty of pace in wide areas now, even more so after signing Mohammed Kudus from West Ham at the start of the window. But creativity in the No 10 role is the glaring issue with the squad.\n\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\n\nAttacking quality is the main focus at Spurs right now.\n\nThe Athletic reported on Monday morning that Spurs have approached Manchester City about signing Brazilian winger Savinho, discussing a package of roughly \u20ac50m for his signing. City, however, said that they do not want to sell Savinho and regard the matter as closed.\n\nTottenham are also big admirers of Nico Paz, the 20-year-old Argentina international currently at Como in Serie A. Como do not currently want to sell Paz either, and Real Madrid have the right to match any bid for Paz this summer.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nSpurs have now moved on most of their talented young players for loan spells, where they will play more football.\n\nThat means that the squad is starting to take shape for next season, although Dane Scarlett, who has been earmarked for a loan, is still there.\n\nThe final question relates to more experienced senior players, such as Yves Bissouma and Richarlison. If they go, then Spurs might have more space to bring more players in, but so far, nothing has happened.\n\nWhy have some Premier League sides spent so little this summer?\n\nThe usual names dominate spending this summer, but it is worth a look at those occupying the other end of the scale.\n\nAt Crystal Palace, the \u00a32m signing of left-back Borna Sosa from Ajax comprises their only spending. Ten miles north west, purse strings have been even tighter; Fulham\u2019s only signing has been 34-year-old backup goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, arriving from Montpellier for less than \u00a3500,000.\n\nPalace\u2019s lack of spending looks hard to unravel from their recent ownership upheaval. For all the drama John Textor\u2019s presence brought to proceedings, he did also bring plenty of funding; Palace\u2019s cash from its owners ticked up notably during his time, with \u00a330m or more pumped in in each of the past four seasons.\n\nThose Textor has left behind are hardly poor but Palace pre-Textor always had a focus on financial sustainability. Save for a \u00a324m injection in 2018-19 to help fund hefty transfer instalments, owner funding before his arrival was minimal, particularly by Premier League standards.\n\nPalace weren\u2019t in any danger of a profit and sustainability rules (PSR) breach this summer, but losses have leapt in recent years and are near \u00a3200m since the onset of the pandemic. Last season\u2019s sales of Michael Olise and Joachim Anderson brought in big money, but Palace boast neither spendthrift owners nor huge revenues.\n\nAt Fulham, Shahid Khan has spent lots during his 12 years at the helm, but the building of the new Riverside Stand has sapped resources. In four seasons from 2020-21 to 2023-24, Fulham spent \u00a3211m on infrastructure projects.\n\nKhan is hardly short, but Fulham need revenues to flow from that build for a couple of reasons. Like Palace, they were fine on PSR last year, but there\u2019s a looming threat. Fulham\u2019s 85 per cent wages-to-revenue ratio was the third highest in the Premier League in 2023-24 and, though the division will continue to operate a version of UEFA\u2019s \u2018squad cost\u2019 limits in shadow again this season, there\u2019s a need to have an eye on the future. Fulham\u2019s frugal summer is unlikely to be entirely agnostic of such considerations.\n\nWhile neither of those two have spent much, five others have sold more than they\u2019ve bought. Propping up the net spend table are Bournemouth, whose net \u00a370m income this summer is only set to increase with Illia Zabarnyi\u2019s likely big-money move to PSG.\n\nOf those five clubs, four, including Bournemouth, finished between seventh and tenth last season. Nottingham Forest, Brighton and Brentford have all made net income of \u00a335m to \u00a340m this summer and, in the case of the latter two, successful player trading has been key to recent rises up the English pyramid.\n\nBrighton spent heavily last year but have returned to being bigger sellers than buyers. They, like those around them, essentially have to trade their way up the table, as they don\u2019t boast the big non-transfer revenues of some others.\n\nLast season\u2019s mid-table sides are generating plenty in sales this summer, but their ability to progress further will be dictated by how well they\u2019re able to reinvest it \u2014 especially at Bournemouth.\n\nBarcelona finished their pre-season with a 5-0 win against Serie A side Como to claim the Joan Gamper Trophy, with Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez scoring two goals apiece.\n\nThere have been plenty more off-pitch issues in the past week, though. Marc-Andre ter Stegen was stripped of his captaincy on Thursday after refusing to allow Barca to share his surgery reports with La Liga \u2014 with the club looking to use a rule regarding injured players to register a new signing under the league\u2019s salary limit regulations.\n\nIf La Liga\u2019s medical panel consider Ter Stegen\u2019s back injury to be long-term \u2014 i.e. it deems the German to be out for at least four months \u2014 Barca would be allowed to use the equivalent of a significant chunk of his salary to register one new player.\n\nThe 34-year-old took a step back a day later, posting a statement on social media in which he said he was keen to cooperate with the club and gave his consent for them to file his medical reports to La Liga. As soon as that happened, Barca released a new statement on Friday night, reinstating him as team captain.\n\nTer Stegen spoke to fans at the Estadi Johan Cruyff before the Joan Gamper game and said he was happy to leave his problems with the club behind.\n\nThere was also an unexpected move: Martinez left to join Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League. Al Nassr offered the 34-year-old centre-back a significant salary improvement, and Martinez left for free, per a \u2018gentleman\u2019s agreement\u2019 between player and club last summer when he had received another lucrative proposal from the Saudi Pro League.\n\nBarca agreed to show openness to let him go if a new offer came in this summer, as was the case here. Martinez did not feature in the final two games of their pre-season tour in South Korea with negotiations ongoing at the time.\n\nHow much of a financial boost is Martinez\u2019s exit?\n\nBarca sources say Martinez\u2019s exit takes off \u20ac14m from their wage bill for this season. But the Catalans will not be able to use all of it to register their new signings. As they are still spending above their salary limit, La Liga does not allow them to spend every euro of new income freely (the so-called 1:1 rule), so they can only use 60 per cent of the salary space freed up by Martinez for new signings.\n\nThe club admit that will not be enough to get all the new registrations done. Barca are still waiting for money from the VIP seating sale they agreed in January to be approved by their auditors and counted as part of their budget.\n\nBarca believe they should be in a strong position once that is approved, but there is no indication this will happen before the end of the week \u2014 with the first game of the season against Real Mallorca on Saturday.\n\nFor now, new signings Joan Garcia, Marcus Rashford and Wojciech Szczesny (following his short-term deal last season) are not registered, and therefore cannot play in that game. Fellow new arrival Roony Bardghji isn\u2019t either, but he could be approved as a reserve team player. Club sources say left-back Gerard Martin also needs to be registered as part of the first team after being promoted from the second team, Barca Atletic, last season.\n\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\n\nHansi Flick said after the Como win that he does not expect the club to make any signings to replace Martinez. \u201cI will speak with Deco when he\u2019s around here, but for now I don\u2019t think any new signing will come in,\u201d he told Catalan television station TV3.\n\nBarca are not actively working on more signings as they believe all positions are well-covered. In Martinez\u2019s absence, players such as Ronald Araujo and Andreas Christensen are expected to step up and fill the gap.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nGoalkeeper Inaki Pena has been on the list of potential departures since the start of pre-season. The 26-year-old is expected to leave, with all parties involved agreeing it is the best solution for him.\n\nBarca sources and voices within the player\u2019s camp say there have been approaches from multiple clubs, including Como and Celta Vigo. But Barca are hesitant to let him go before they register their new goalkeeper Garcia, who signed from local rivals Espanyol earlier this summer.\n\nAs things stand, Pena is the only first-team \u2018keeper registered for Barca in La Liga \u2014 and therefore the only one who could play on Saturday. Club sources expect to make progress with Pena\u2019s exit as soon as there is progress with registrations.\n\nThe club have also allowed 19-year-old right-back Hector Fort to look for more playing time elsewhere. They are open to letting him go on loan or move permanently, but would look to keep a buy-back clause. Jules Kounde and Eric Garcia are ahead of Fort in the pecking order.\n\nAnd finally there is Oriol Romeu \u2014 yes, he is still a Barca player. They signed him in 2023, and he is entering the final year of his contract. The club plan to agree to a contract termination with him and he is in talks with other teams, including Girona \u2014 who Barca signed him from, and where he spent last season on loan.\n\nThe main news was academy graduate Gonzalo Garcia\u2019s renewal until 2030, making him a first-team player. The Athletic reported in the previous edition of The Transfer DealSheet that his agent was in talks with the club over the extension.\n\nThe club have rewarded the 21-year-old striker for his impressive performances at the Club World Cup. He arrived at that tournament with plans to leave in search of more playing time \u2014 with Getafe then very well positioned to sign him \u2014 but ended it as top scorer with four goals and an assist in six games.\n\nXabi Alonso\u2019s confidence in Gonzalo was a key factor in the decision, especially given doubts about his playing time with Endrick coming back from injury. The young Brazilian has been handed Madrid\u2019s iconic No 9 shirt, as first revealed by The Athletic, despite reports suggesting it would go to Gonzalo.\n\nGonzalo will wear 16, while summer signing Franco Mastantuono will be given the only remaining number, 25. The Argentine, who was signed from River Plate in June for around \u20ac63.2m, is expected to be officially unveiled on Thursday and will take the final spot in Madrid\u2019s 25-man La Liga squad.\n\nReinier Jesus\u2019 exit to Atletico Mineiro on a free transfer was also officially announced. The 23-year-old Brazilian midfielder left without having made his first-team debut after Madrid paid Flamengo \u20ac30m for him in 2020. The Spanish club retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause.\n\nWhy does Alonso\u2019s opinion of the squad\u2019s readiness differ from the club\u2019s?\n\nFirstly, because coaches generally always want more signings, while the board, who are responsible for balancing the books, are more cautious.\n\nSenior Madrid sources say that each position is covered by two players, all 25 places in the team\u2019s La Liga squad are filled and that nobody wants to leave. Alonso understands the situation but would ideally like more reinforcements.\n\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\n\nNone actively. If there are no further exits \u2014 and no player has indicated a desire to leave at this point \u2014 there is no room for new arrivals.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nFor now, nobody has expressed an interest in leaving.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the squad is closed yet,\u201d one anonymous player told The Athletic, saying that with every position filled, some players will barely be given any playing time.\n\nPeople at the club are keen to see David Alaba or Ferland Mendy leave, but are pessimistic about their chances of offloading them.\n\nAlonso and his staff would also welcome departures if it would help bring in new signings. Rodrygo is not expected to be a key player this season under the coach and the club\u2019s plans, with Premier League clubs interested in him.\n\nSome at Madrid believe a lack of playing time for certain players at the start of the season could lead to some movement, but that is just a feeling behind the scenes at the club.\n\nWould a Premier League side benefit from signing Rodrygo this summer?\n\nIn Real Madrid\u2019s star-studded attack, Brazilian winger Rodrygo can often feel like the forgotten man. With the club now open to selling him, it seems he\u2019s not at the forefront of Alonso\u2019s mind either.\n\nWhile he hasn\u2019t always matched the ludicrously high standards set by Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior, that shouldn\u2019t obscure the fact that he is a hugely talented player in his own right.\n\nRodrygo\u2019s attacking numbers last season \u2014 six goals and five assists \u2014 don\u2019t leap off the page. But that was partly due to the more selfless role he played under Carlo Ancelotti. Shunted to the right to make room for Mbappe, he gave up his most prolific position on the left for the good of the team.\n\nHis versatility has been invaluable for Real Madrid, filling in across the width of the pitch, and on occasion even playing centre forward. It speaks to the multi-faceted nature of his game that he remains effective wherever deployed.\n\nRodrygo is a skilful ball carrier \u2014 ranking 12th in La Liga last season for successful take-ons per 90 \u2014 and he drives his team upfield with invention. His relentless work off the ball allows his more illustrious teammates to conserve energy for decisive moments in attack.\n\nThere are few attacking talents as well-rounded as Rodrygo at the sharp end of the game. Real Madrid might be about to offer up one of the bargains of the summer.",

      "text": "Welcome to the 10th edition of The Athletic\u2019s Transfer DealSheet for the summer 2025 transfer window.\nOur team of dedicated writers, including David Ornstein, will take you inside the market to explain the deals being worked on. The transfer window is open and will run until September 1.\nThe information found within this article has been gathered according to The Athletic\u2019s sourcing guidelines. Unless stated, our reporters have spoken to more than one person briefed on each deal before offering the clubs involved the opportunity to comment. Their responses, when they were given, have been included.\nAdvertisement\nWe aim to bring you analysis you can trust about what is happening at Europe\u2019s leading clubs and the latest information we\u2019re hearing from across the market. This year, The Athletic\u2019s football finance writer, Chris Weatherspoon, will be adding to our analysis of the transfer market.\nLast week, we looked at Liverpool\u2019s financial position, a possible new contract for a Chelsea target, and Manchester United\u2019s striker options. This week, we look at the striker high among the options left on the market, a possible deal for an Arsenal midfielder, and the latest on Benjamin Sesko.\nThis article is long but detailed, so enjoy it all \u2014 or search for the club or player you want to read about.\nDavid Ornstein\u2019s One To Watch\nAs the striker jigsaw continues to form, the football world is watching closely to discover how the various pieces will eventually fall into place.\nThe likes of Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres have made their moves, but the futures of players such as Alexander Isak and Benjamin Sesko are yet to be resolved.\nOn Monday night, The Athletic revealed that Newcastle United have increased their offer for Sesko as they battle Manchester United to secure the 22-year-old.\nWhoever misses out will need to find an alternative recruit \u2014 unless they stick with existing personnel \u2014 and there is not a huge array of candidates on the market.\nWhether it is for those two clubs or others also looking to strengthen up front, that will naturally increase the consideration given to the market\u2019s remaining options.\nHigh among them is Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson, owing to his suitability and availability.\nThe Stamford Bridge side are not desperate to trade the 24-year-old, especially given they require depth ahead of contesting Champions League football next season.\nBut the arrival of Delap and Joao Pedro provides competition and puts Jackson at risk of not being the primary forward, and after scoring 30 goals across 81 games in west London, he will want to be the main man somewhere.\nAdvertisement\nThat explains why Chelsea are open to sanctioning the Senegal international\u2019s departure if an acceptable proposal arrives.\nInterest stems from suitors in both the Premier League and Europe. Some of them want Jackson only if their key target cannot be obtained, or someone leaves; others in addition to what they already have.\nEither way, there is a growing expectation that he will exit, and developments on that case are anticipated in the coming days.\nIt would continue a remarkable sequence of sales completed or agreed by Chelsea, which means they will have accumulated more than \u00a3200million ($265m) in the current transfer window. They are forecasting another \u00a3100m to \u00a3150m before the deadline.\nWhy top clubs would benefit from signing Jackson\nIn an increasingly transitional league, Nicolas Jackson\u2019s devastating ability on the break is a highly sought-after resource. Last season saw a seven-year high of 112 Premier League goals scored from counter-attacks, and few players were as central to those moves as Jackson.\nHis ability to collect the ball in deep areas and surge up the pitch sets him apart. According to advanced data provider Footovision, he led the division for counter-attacking involvements via ball carries.\nJackson is electric in transition, but his finishing and final-third choices remain raw. Yet few strikers possess the relentless desire and movement to reach those advanced areas in the first place: Jackson made 60 sprints in behind the defence \u2014 defined by SkillCorner as off-ball runs of at least 25km/h \u2014 nine more than any other Premier League player.\nJackson specialises in specific traits that make him an appealing profile for a host of Premier League clubs. And for all the noise around his performances, it\u2019s easy to forget that Jackson has hit double figures for league goals in both of his two seasons at Stamford Bridge.\nConor O\u2019Neill\nWhat else we\u2019re hearing\n- RB Leipzig have received an improved offer from Newcastle United to sign Benjamin Sesko. An opening bid worth \u20ac75million (\u00a365m; $87m) plus \u20ac5million in add-ons was deemed insufficient by Leipzig, leading Newcastle to raise that to at least \u20ac80m. Sesko is also wanted by Manchester United, but a proposal has yet to arrive from Old Trafford and the figures they have indicated a willingness to pay are lower than those of Newcastle at present. That leaves the St James\u2019 Park side in a strong position as things stand, after a day of positive talks held by their co-owner Jamie Reuben with Leipzig and the 22-year-old striker. Nothing is agreed yet and there is currently no guarantee of the outcome, which could still be Sesko staying if Leipzig do not accept a deal. David Ornstein\n- Burnley are set to strengthen in midfield ahead of their return to the Premier League after reaching an agreement with Chelsea to sign Lesley Ugochukwu. The France youth international, 21, has been granted permission to travel for medical tests and complete a permanent move to Turf Moor. If all goes to plan, Ugochukwu will put pen to paper on a five-year contract \u2014 significantly boosting head coach Scott Parker\u2019s options in the No 6 and No 8 roles. David Ornstein\n- Manchester City have reached an agreement in principle with Ruben Dias to sign a new contract. The 28-year-old\u2019s existing deal expires in 2027. Dias has been a major part of City\u2019s success since he joined from Benfica for an initial \u00a362m in 2020. David Ornstein\n- Stuttgart are working on a deal to sign attacking midfielder Fabio Vieira from Arsenal. The German club have approached their Premier League counterparts about Vieira. The 25-year-old was loaned to Porto last season, but Stuttgart\u2019s interest is in a permanent move. An agreement has yet to be reached, but talks are ongoing, with Arsenal likely to seek a respectable price for a player they recruited for up to \u20ac40m in the summer of 2022. David Ornstein\n- Borussia Dortmund remain interested in securing the permanent transfer of Chelsea\u2019s Carney Chukwuemeka, who spent last season on loan at the Westfalenstadion. Chelsea have no interest in loaning Chukwuemeka out again and would only consider a permanent deal for the 21-year-old. Sebastian Stafford-Bloor and Simon Johnson\n- Botafogo have reached an agreement with Bournemouth to sign Neto. The 36-year-old Brazilian goalkeeper was scheduled to fly to Rio de Janeiro on Monday night and undergo a medical before completing the proposed move. It will not involve a transfer fee, but as one of Bournemouth\u2019s highest earners, the Premier League club will make significant salary savings. Neto\u2019s contract was due to end next June, and he is set to join Botafogo on a deal until the summer of 2027, with an option to extend by six months. Bournemouth have already signed Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea as their new No 1, while Neto spent last season on loan with Arsenal. David Ornstein\n- Everton are in talks with Chelsea over the permanent transfer of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for an initial fee of \u00a325m. As reported by The Athletic last week, Chelsea will only consider a permanent sale and placed a valuation of \u00a330m \u2014 the fee they paid Leicester City last year \u2014 on the midfielder, while other Premier League clubs have also made enquiries. Patrick Boyland and Simon Johnson\nWho has spent the most in the Premier League so far this window?\nA look at Premier League spending by club so far this summer throws up few surprises at the top end. Using figures sourced from Transfermarkt, Liverpool\u2019s big summer puts them top of the tree with over \u00a3250m spent on new players; add in \u00a325m on Giorgi Mamardashvili (deal agreed last summer, but only joined Liverpool officially this season) and expectations of agent fees and the four per cent transfer levy payable by clubs on incoming transfers and you land beyond \u00a3300m.\nAdvertisement\nBehind Liverpool sit Chelsea, again offering little surprise. Indeed, of the seven clubs to have spent over \u00a3100m to date, all but one form part of England\u2019s \u2018Big Six\u2019. The exception, Sunderland, have spent heavily as a result of past prudence and out of necessity as a newly promoted club. They are expected to spend even more before the season commences.\nOf greater note are those clubs that haven\u2019t spent much yet. Between Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Fulham, less than \u00a310m has been laid out on new players, which looks pretty stark when set against the backdrop of the rest of the division\u2019s spending.\nPremier League clubs have spent over \u00a31.8billion on players so far this summer, though plenty of that has been among themselves, with the division\u2019s net spend standing at around \u00a3865m.\nEven so, Premier League spending continues to dominate the world transfer market. That net spend figure is far and away the most in football this summer, with only the Saudi Pro League also reaching nine figures (\u00a3185m). The Saudi league\u2019s gross spend is just \u00a3280m so far, though there are expectations that will soon rise.\nChris Weatherspoon\nArsenal\nWhat happened this week?\nAfter a flurry of activity, it has been a quieter week at Arsenal.\nArsenal\u2019s recruitment drive continues at academy level, although the club missed out on 17-year-old Salford City striker Will Wright. Despite agreeing on a fee of \u00a3200,000 plus add-ons with Salford, Arsenal never reached an agreement on personal terms with the player. Wright preferred to remain in the north west, and that allowed Liverpool to steal in and secure a deal.\nThe club are still looking for a striker to complement Andre Harriman-Annous, who toured with the first team in Asia, at under-21 level. Arsenal have had a second bid rejected for 17-year-old Blackburn Rovers striker Igor Tyjon.\nThey have managed to secure the signing of 16-year-old goalkeeper Remi Lupinski from MK Dons. Lupinski, who will be part of Arsenal\u2019s under-17s next season, has signed a two-year scholarship deal.\nWhich youngsters impressing in pre-season could fill gaps in the squad?\nLast summer, the performances of Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri in pre-season forced them into first-team contention. Arsenal adapted their transfer plans accordingly, loaning out Vieira to provide Nwaneri with opportunities to develop.\nThis year, it\u2019s 15-year-old Max Dowman who has captured the imagination with a series of impressive cameos. It is unclear how regularly he will be involved with the first team once the competitive season starts.\nAdvertisement\nThus far, left-footed Dowman has featured on the right wing. That\u2019s a position where Arsenal have more experienced alternatives. Bukayo Saka is one of the first names on the team sheet and Arsenal have also welcomed Noni Madueke to Colney in recent days. Madueke cut short his holiday to start training with Arsenal ahead of schedule.\nThe 2025-26 season is the first campaign in which Dowman will be eligible for either the Arsenal first-team or their under-21s. It is expected he will feature for both teams across the course of the campaign.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nIf Arsenal are to make a significant addition to the first-team squad, it is most likely to be on the left wing. Any acquisition may be connected to the futures of Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard.\nArsenal hold a long-term interest in 19-year-old Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet. The France Under-21 international was discussed as a potential signing before Arsenal moved ahead with a deal for Cristhian Mosquera.\nDepartures of defenders such as Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior could lead Arsenal to revisit their interest, but Jacquet signed a new deal with Rennes as recently as May, tying him to the Ligue 1 club until 2029.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nKiwior has been the subject of interest from Porto.\nThe Polish international defender enjoys life at Arsenal, but at 25, he is interested in exploring opportunities to join clubs where he would be regarded as a first-choice player.\nArsenal are not in a hurry to move Kiwior on, but as with most players, there is a number at which a deal would make sense for all parties.\nA number of other players on the fringes of the first-team squad could be allowed to leave before the transfer deadline. There is interest from Fulham in Reiss Nelson.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal also hope to find buyers for Zinchenko, Albert Sambi Lokonga, and Karl Hein. Vieira is being targeted by Stuttgart. The 25-year-old was loaned to Porto last season, but Stuttgart\u2019s interest is in a permanent move. An agreement has yet to be reached, but talks are ongoing.\nA number of academy players may also be permitted to leave permanently if a suitable opportunity arises.\nJames McNicholas\nChelsea\nWhat happened this week?\nIt has been a busy one. As far as incomings go, Chelsea completed the purchase of Netherlands international defender Jorrel Hato for a fee in excess of \u20ac40m. They also won the race to sign highly rated England Under-19 midfielder Jesse Derry, who chose to run his contract down at Crystal Palace.\nMore work has been done on the departures front. Joao Felix joined Al Nassr as expected for an initial \u20ac30m, with add-ons potentially taking it to \u20ac50m.\nBurnley have beaten off competition from teams across Europe to buy midfielder Ugochukwu. They also agreed a fee with Chelsea for striker Armando Broja. As reported in the transfer DealSheet last week, Chelsea\u2019s asking price was \u00a325m. The final sum is unlikely to be made public.\nEverton are in talks over the signing of midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for an initial fee of \u00a325m, and discussions are ongoing. There is also interest from other Premier League clubs. The transfer DealSheet revealed last week that several Premier League teams had made an enquiry and that Chelsea\u2019s asking price is around \u00a330m.\nSunderland are close to finalising a season-long loan for striker Marc Guiu. The negotiation has included inserting a clause akin to Broja\u2019s loan to Fulham last year, where a penalty fee will have to be paid if the forward does not play a certain number of games. Sunderland sources are comfortable with the situation and do not see such a clause being problematic.\nAdvertisement\nThere has been a lot of activity with sister club Strasbourg, too. Midfielder Kendry Paez and goalkeeper Mike Penders joined them on a season-long loan, while under-21 defender Ishe Samuels-Smith moved permanently for an undisclosed fee.\nMeanwhile, under-21 midfielder Leo Castledine left on loan for Huddersfield Town and another talented member of the development squad, Alex Matos, is nearing a permanent departure.\nDo Chelsea have what they need to compete on four fronts?\nChelsea believe they have improved the squad from the one that finished fourth in the Premier League and won the Conference League.\nThe two wingers that have left \u2014 Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke \u2014 have already been replaced by Jamie Gittens and Estevao Willian. The attack has been strengthened, too, with the arrivals of Liam Delap (Ipswich Town) and Joao Pedro (Brighton & Hove Albion), plus extra midfield cover has been provided with the additions of Dario Essugo (Sporting CP) and Andrey Santos, who has returned from Strasbourg on loan.\nHato\u2019s purchase has also filled in a major gap in the group, as Marc Cucurella finally has cover from someone who actually naturally plays in the position rather than switching right-backs Malo Gusto or Reece James across.\nMore departures are expected, particularly higher up the pitch, and that will leave space for more arrivals to come.\nThe only area they will not add to, which will come under scrutiny from the fan base, is in goal. They have no intention to buy another goalkeeper now, despite pursuing Mike Maignan earlier in the window. Chelsea are happy with Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen as their two main choices. Indeed, they turned down an offer from a Champions League club for the latter.\nIn terms of the overall picture, head coach Enzo Maresca will have the opportunity to rotate due to the amount of options at his disposal.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nThe primary areas are another winger and a creative player, which is why the names Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons will not go away. Both players depend on exits. Chelsea are in informal discussions with Manchester United over Garnacho, but that is as far as it has gone.\nThe same can be said for Simons. No formal bid has been made to RB Leipzig yet. Chelsea do have other players on their wishlist for these roles, including Aston Villa\u2019s Morgan Rogers.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAs my colleague David Ornstein reports, Chelsea are not desperate to sell Nicolas Jackson but would be open to sanctioning his departure if the right proposal arrives.\nThe transfer DealSheet revealed last month that Chelsea are open to loaning out winger Tyrique George, but the situation has developed since then.\nChelsea are talking with George\u2019s representatives to figure out the best option going forward. A straight loan is still a possibility, but Chelsea will not consider any proposals including an option to buy. Like Guiu, the club want some kind of conditions in place regarding playing time if there is a loan.\nA permanent sale is being discussed, too, but Chelsea would like to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on fee. A number of teams in England and Europe have registered their interest in both scenarios.\nChristopher Nkunku, who is valued at \u20ac50m, has been given permission to miss the start of pre-season training. He is the subject of enquiries from a number of clubs in England, Italy and Germany. Two teams that looked like possible candidates to sign him earlier in the window \u2014 Manchester United and RB Leipzig \u2014 are now deemed unlikely.\nJackson is the subject of approaches from multiple clubs in England and Europe, too. Chelsea do not see him as untouchable, but will demand a high fee similar to what other starting centre-forwards have cost when transferred to other clubs this summer.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea are still working on the sales of Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Renato Veiga, Carney Chukwuemeka, who is of interest to Borussia Dortmund, and Axel Disasi. They want to get their situations resolved before entering the final week.\nAlfie Gilchrist is still hopeful of joining a Championship side, but he may have to wait until the end of the month. Defender Aaron Anselmino is highly rated at Chelsea after integrating into the camp during the second half of last season and will be sent on loan. Teams in Europe have made an enquiry.\nSimon Johnson\nLiverpool\nWhat happened this week?\nLiverpool\u2019s pursuit of Alexander Isak continued, but there were no signs of a breakthrough.\nA \u00a3110m bid for the Sweden striker was rejected by Newcastle United, who value their prized asset close to \u00a3150m and will not consider selling unless an offer is too good to turn down and they source a suitable replacement.\nMeanwhile, after Luis Diaz completed his move to Bayern Munich, another Liverpool forward edged closer towards an exit as Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal identified Darwin Nunez as their priority target. Milan have also shown an interest in the Uruguayan, although it\u2019s unlikely they will be able to afford him as the cost of the total package is deemed too expensive.\nOn the pitch, Arne Slot\u2019s side wrapped up their pre-season friendly schedule with a double-header against Athletic Club on Monday night at Anfield.\nIs it Isak or bust up front?\nSlot has consistently reiterated that he is only looking for players who can immediately improve the squad, and clearly Isak fits the bill.\nLanding the 25-year-old striker would supercharge an attack that won the title last season and also boost the options ahead of further expected outgoings.\nYet there\u2019s no intention to stockpile players for the sake of it should a move for Isak not progress. Liverpool have new signings Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz alongside Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah already in the attacking department, while Jeremie Frimpong is an attack-minded right-sided player. There\u2019s no intention to block Rio Ngumoha\u2019s pathway, either, so it would take a standout market opportunity for Liverpool to consider a different attacking option.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nCentre-back is an area that remains a little light following Jarell Quansah\u2019s exit to Bayer Leverkusen.\nIdeally, Slot would like another defender so he has strong competition for places, and a number of young players have been considered.\nThe alternative is turning to either Ryan Gravenberch or Wataru Endo to fill in if Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, or Joe Gomez are not available.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nTyler Morton is on the verge of moving to Lyon for a fee of \u00a315m, inclusive of add-ons.\nFederico Chiesa is still weighing up his options ahead of a likely exit this month, while Kostas Tsimikas debates his future with two years remaining on his contract.\nA number of clubs have shown interest in Ben Doak, but Liverpool are waiting for any offers to sign the winger on a permanent deal before deciding what happens next. James McConnell and Luca Stephenson are expected to go out on loan, but there is growing interest in both players from clubs who are considering a permanent move.\nGregg Evans\nManchester City\nWhat happened this week?\nGoalkeeper James Trafford officially rejoined from Burnley, two years after leaving. City sold him for \u00a314m and bought him back for \u00a327m, which means the value of the deal in book value is \u00a313m.\nLeaving the club on loan was 19-year-old winger Joel Ndala, who joined Hull City. He spent a year at PSV Jong (their second-tier side) and the last four months of last season at Nottingham Forest, which he mainly spent with their Premier League 2 side. They did not take up the option to sign him permanently.\nAre we getting to the stage where City might cut any of their unwanted players loose?\nNumbers certainly have to come down now, with less than a month remaining of the window. They have yet to make headway on that, though, with Jack Grealish, Kalvin Phillips and James McAtee all still City players.\nOther possible departures are being narrowed down as players commit to staying. John Stones is not leaving in the final year of his deal, while the plan is for Abdukodir Khusanov to stay.\nAdvertisement\nThe Uzbek defender\u2019s first six months have been seen as a period to adjust to a new culture, league and language. The fact he can operate at right-back as well as centre-back is also useful.\nThere could be several players heading out on loan, though.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nTrafford represented the final bit of proactive business in terms of incomings.\nThe priority is now sorting the futures of the players who are surplus to requirements, unless an opportunity arises in a position that improves the team and adds value.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nClaudio Echeverri\u2019s future is still to be decided as he is highly thought of internally, but a spot in Argentina\u2019s World Cup squad next summer is on his mind.\nHe has yet to be capped by the senior team, but sources close to the player believe that a loan move is needed to ensure he plays enough. A move to fellow City Football Group club Girona is not on the cards, with the preference being a loan to a Premier League side, if he does leave.\nBrazilian defender Vitor Reis is also in discussions about leaving on loan for the season, potentially to Girona, with his international ambitions also playing a part.\nElsewhere, many European clubs have registered interest in acquiring Sverre Nypan on loan. Bundesliga clubs are in the race, but conversations are ongoing to identify the best destination for his development.\nAt the top end of the academy, Watford and Swansea City are battling for the signature of defender Max Alleyne, who is in talks to extend his contract before heading out on his first loan. Several European clubs have also shown interest.\nJordan Campbell\nManchester United\nWhat happened this week?\nUnited\u2019s summer-long striker search narrowed to a single, priority target: RB Leipzig\u2019s Benjamin Sesko.\nInformal club-to-club talks have taken place with Leipzig, as have discussions with Sesko\u2019s representatives over prospective personal terms. Competition from Newcastle United is fierce \u2014 they made an improved offer for the striker on Monday night. An opening bid worth \u20ac75m plus \u20ac5million in add-ons was deemed insufficient by Leipzig, leading Newcastle to raise that to at least \u20ac80m.\nAdvertisement\nChristopher Vivell, United\u2019s director of recruitment, served in the same role at Red Bull Salzburg when Sesko joined from Slovenian club Domzale in 2019 and has been a driving force behind United\u2019s pursuit. But a proposal has yet to arrive from Old Trafford and as The Athletic\u2019s David Ornstein reports, the figures they have indicated a willingness to pay are presently lower than those of Newcastle.\nOmar Berrada, United\u2019s chief executive, told MUTV before Sunday\u2019s 2-2 draw with Everton in the United States that a recruitment team, including Vivell, is \u201cworking around the clock\u201d back in Manchester to further strengthen the squad.\n\u201cWe have to do a lot of multitasking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure we stay on top of it.\u201d\nElsewhere, academy players Ethan Wheatley and Jack Moorhouse both secured loans to League One clubs, joining Northampton Town and Leyton Orient respectively until the end of the season.\nUnited have narrowed their search to a single priority striker: Sesko (Maja Hitij/Getty Images)\nWhy did Man Utd decide on Sesko as their first choice?\nUnited had previously whittled their striker shortlist down to Sesko and Aston Villa\u2019s Ollie Watkins, who would offer valuable Premier League experience, such as new arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.\nSesko is a rawer and riskier alternative to Watkins, but also far from an unknown quantity in the corridors of Carrington and Old Trafford. United previously explored a move for him when he was just 16 years old, before he had left his native Slovenia.\nUnited revived their interest during Erik ten Hag\u2019s first summer in charge, but Sesko committed to swapping Red Bull Salzburg for their stablemates in Leipzig. He was a target early last summer, too, before attention turned to Joshua Zirkzee.\nAdvertisement\nSesko\u2019s record in the Bundesliga of 27 goals in 64 appearances over the past two seasons is solid without being spectacular and raises questions over whether he is capable of making an immediate impact.\nBut at 22, he is significantly younger than the 29-year-old Watkins, and his rare blend of speed and stature with a powerful strike has made him one of the most highly rated young centre-forwards in Europe.\nSpending north of \u20ac80m on Sesko\u2019s potential would represent a gamble, but should he realise that potential, United would have a striker capable of leading the line for years to come.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nOther than up front, United have been assessing their options in midfield. Amorim is keen to add more dynamism in the middle of the park.\nA goalkeeper signing has also been considered, although with Andre Onana expected to stay, any further addition will likely depend on whether understudy Altay Bayindir departs in search of regular minutes.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nThe Sesko pursuit brings Rasmus Hojlund\u2019s future into question, despite him making no secret of his desire to stay and fight for his place.\nWhile there is interest in the 22-year-old, United will almost certainly need to swallow a loss on his book value of around \u00a340m to let him go. Offers of \u00a330m will be considered.\nGarnacho is the subject of interest from Chelsea, and Real Betis hope to sign Antony on a permanent basis after his successful loan spell in La Liga last season, but neither move is advanced.\nUnited are also eager to offload Sancho, are open to offers for Tyrell Malacia, and could allow Toby Collyer to leave on loan.\nMark Critchley\nNewcastle United\nWhat happened this week?\nBlimey, where to begin?\nThey finally received \u2014 and rebuffed \u2014 an offer for Isak, with Liverpool\u2019s formal bid of \u00a3110m some \u00a310m less than their unofficial expression of interest last month and a great deal less than Newcastle\u2019s \u00a3150m valuation. Isak, who has not been on the club\u2019s pre-season tour to East Asia, instead trained alone at Real Sociedad, his former club, before returning to Newcastle\u2019s training ground on Monday.\nAfter suffering a series of high-profile rejections this summer, Newcastle identified Sesko as their leading target to replace Isak or, \u201cin an ideal world\u201d, play alongside him.\nThey followed that up with a bid worth \u20ac80m to RB Leipzig, but that fell short of the German club\u2019s demands. Newcastle are working flat-out on Sesko, with Jamie Reuben, one of the club\u2019s co-owners, taking a personal interest and being heavily involved, but they are aware they are competing for Sesko with Manchester United.\nAdvertisement\nOn Monday, Newcastle made an improved offer. This leaves them in a strong position as things stand, following a day of positive talks held by Reuben with Leipzig and the striker.\nTheir pursuit of Brentford\u2019s Yoane Wissa is ongoing.\nThey completed their second senior signing of the window with goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale joining from Southampton on a season-long loan with an option to buy at the end of the season.\nThe 18-year-old winger, Antonio Cordero, newly arrived from Malaga, left for Westerlo in Belgium on a season-long loan, while midfielder Isaac Hayden was released from his contract.\nIs the slow-moving nature of Newcastle\u2019s business becoming a problem?\nThe slow-moving nature of everything Newcastle do (or don\u2019t do) is a concern. Almost 11 months after Darren Eales announced he would be stepping down as chief executive after a diagnosis of blood cancer, the club have still not confirmed his replacement, with Eales now on medical leave. Nor do they have a sporting director after Paul Mitchell saw out his notice and left at the end of June.\nBoth of these things, to put it mildly, are sub-optimal. It means, for the second summer in succession, there is a huge flux at the top of the club.\nIn terms of the bigger picture, there has been no tangible movement on a new stadium or training ground; while these are huge, complex projects, it has become difficult for Howe to point to progress in other areas of the club.\nRewind to the end of last season, when Newcastle sealed qualification for the Champions League and Howe said: \u201cWe have to be ready to conclude things very quickly because good players don\u2019t hang around for long.\u201d\nThat, clearly, did not happen. Was this a failure of preparation, which should have taken place on Mitchell\u2019s watch? Was it because Howe wanted, where possible, oven-ready Premier League players? Was it a combination of both, plus less-than-perfect circumstances?\nAdvertisement\nWhatever the case, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, James Trafford, and Hugo Ekitike have all ended up moving to traditional \u2018Big Six\u2019 clubs.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nFor obvious reasons, centre-forward towers above everything else. With Callum Wilson leaving Newcastle at the end of last season and subsequently joining West Ham United, some form of backup for Isak was already required.\nThere has been a glimpse of what life without Isak would look like during pre-season fixtures. William Osula, the only established centre-forward available to Howe, started three matches in succession; the Denmark Under-21 International is yet to start once in the Premier League. Against Tottenham Hotspur, Anthony Gordon began up front. Neither is a long-term solution.\nRight-sided centre-half is another longstanding requirement. Mitchell spent weeks attempting to sign Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Guehi a year ago, and he remains of interest, but is Newcastle still of interest to the England defender? Atalanta\u2019s Giorgio Scalvini and Marseille\u2019s Leonardo Balerdi have featured during transfer discussions, but other European-based players are under active consideration.\nHaving sold Sean Longstaff to Leeds United, Howe\u2019s options in midfield are thinner, particularly with Joe Willock now out for between four and six weeks with a calf injury. Ideally, there would be reinforcements here, too, although little has been ideal about this summer.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAll roads lead back to Isak.\nNewcastle have been careful to leave escape routes open for their most important player. There has been no criticism of him in public, although there were some pointed general remarks from Howe on Sunday when he told reporters: \u201cNo player can expect to act poorly and train with the group as normal.\u201d They still believe he can be reintegrated, but this will, in part, be determined by the player\u2019s attitude, as well as Liverpool, whose interest remains.\nAdvertisement\nAs Isak\u2019s situation shows, Newcastle cannot take anything for granted, but they are determined to hold on to their other prize assets, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimaraes, Gordon and Tino Livramento.\nBeyond that, Burnley are talking to the club about signing Martin Dubravka, the goalkeeper, while Odysseas Vlachodimos, another goalkeeper, is also available, most likely for a loan.\nNewcastle would not stand in the way of full-backs Matt Targett or Harrison Ashby leaving.\nWhich Premier League clubs could do with selling players this window?\nThere are four weeks remaining in this summer\u2019s transfer window and, though eyes will inevitably be drawn to incomings, it\u2019s a natural byproduct of modern football \u2014 profit and sustainability rules (PSR), cash flow, and squad sizes \u2014 that some clubs will be in greater need of selling than others.\nChelsea provide perhaps the most obvious example, their settlement agreement with UEFA last month dictating that to register new players to their Champions League squad list, they need to ensure a \u2018positive transfer balance\u2019. In other words, outgoings need to outweigh the cost of those newly registered players.\nIn truth, Chelsea\u2019s business model has long relied on player trading and they\u2019ve been effective sellers for years. Their need to sell is not a sign of desperation, more a fact of Stamford Bridge life.\nAs reported by David Ornstein, Jackson\u2019s exit could represent another big sale for Chelsea.\nManchester United might not be desperate, but their desire to sell players this summer is heightened, not least because they\u2019ve been such poor sellers in the past. Already this window, they have benefited from significant sell-on fees via moves involving Alvaro Carreras, Anthony Elanga and Maxi Oyedele.\nUnited haven\u2019t sold anyone themselves yet, though the savings on Marcus Rashford\u2019s wages for a year are sizeable. United\u2019s financial concerns are more cash-focused than based on any ongoing PSR worries, as they owed significant transfer instalments even before the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo. Outgoings, with Garnacho and Antony the prime candidates, might not be financial necessities, but United need to get better at selling, and there\u2019s no time better than the present.\nAdvertisement\nElsewhere, several clubs have already been active sellers of talent. Bournemouth, Brighton and Nottingham Forest have each banked over \u00a3100m in sales this summer. Wolves and Brentford aren\u2019t far behind. West Ham\u2019s sale of Mohammed Kudus pretty much offsets their spending on new faces.\nArsenal are the Premier League\u2019s highest spenders on a net basis currently, committing around \u00a3200m in fees while only recouping small sums on Nuno Tavares and Marquinhos. They had a lean year in terms of transfer spending last season, giving them scope to splurge this time around, but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if they sought some sales this month.\nLikewise Liverpool. The Athletic has detailed how they can afford their big spending, but the desire to land Isak looks a stretch without a departure, if only because of Fenway Sports Group\u2019s continued desire to run the club sustainably. Nunez leaving would have the benefit of freeing up a striker spot and, most likely, generating a decent fee.\nChris Weatherspoon\nTottenham Hotspur\nWhat happened this week?\nThe biggest story was Son Heung-min playing his last game for Tottenham Hotspur after 10 glorious years. Negotiations are currently ongoing for a move to LAFC, and Son played 66 minutes of the friendly against Newcastle before he was taken off to huge applause.\nIt remains to be seen when Son\u2019s move to LA will be confirmed, and whether Spurs will be straight into the market for a replacement. But the other major development from Sunday was James Maddison being taken off on a stretcher with a worrying-looking knee injury. If it was as serious as it looked, then Spurs may have an issue with creativity in the middle of the pitch.\nThey did make another midfield addition on Sunday, though, with Portugal international Joao Palhinha joining from Bayern Munich on loan. Meanwhile, Mikey Moore joined Rangers on a season\u2019s loan.\nDoes Palhinha solve an issue in the middle?\nMost definitely. Tottenham have lacked a solid defensive midfielder for years. Last season they had to make do with Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma in that position, with a few occasional contributions from Archie Gray. And they never looked secure.\nThe decision to allow Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to go to Marseille last summer, while understandable, left Tottenham short in that role. Too many times last year, opponents just counter-attacked through the middle of the pitch, or easily got a shot off from the edge of the box.\nIt is no surprise that Thomas Frank wanted to change that. The former Brentford head coach wanted to bring Christian Norgaard in from his former club, but he chose Arsenal. Frank will hope Palhinha will do the job. He had two good years at Fulham where he comfortably led the Premier League in tackles, proving that he was one of the best players around at stealing the ball and breaking up opposition attacks. And even though he struggled to make much of an impact at Bayern, he should be perfectly equipped to deliver some much-needed defensive stability at the base of Spurs\u2019 midfield.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nThe big question for Spurs is whether Maddison\u2019s knee injury forces them back into the market to add some creative quality before the end of the window. They pushed hard to sign Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest earlier in the window for \u00a360m. But with Gibbs-White staying at Forest, and Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski both down with knee injuries, Spurs have a serious lack of midfield to start the season.\nFans will be expecting the club to be bold in the market and try to sign some established quality, and would love Tottenham to re-enter the race to sign Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace.\nBeyond that, there are some areas that could do with strengthening, such as another left-sided defender, or possibly another centre forward.\nSpurs have five senior centre-backs. Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero are first-choice. Kevin Danso appears to have become the best backup option while Radu Dragusin recovers from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury he suffered in January. Kota Takai joined Spurs from J League side Kawasaki Frontale earlier this summer but has not featured in any pre-season games because he is suffering from a foot injury. Luka Vuskovic looks promising, but is more likely to head out on loan for regular game time to help his development.\nThey are interested in signing another centre-back before the window closes. Van de Ven and Romero both missed large chunks of last season through injury. Dragusin will not be available any time soon, and Takai will need time to acclimatise to a new country and environment. Spurs need more depth and quality to enable them to compete in the Premier League and the Champions League, and to avoid the injury crisis they suffered under Postecoglou last season.\nBut midfield remains the big story for the rest of August.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nSon\u2019s move to MLS is likely to be tied up soon, with Spurs hoping to get a fee of close to \u00a320m, which would mean they had almost made back the whole \u00a322m they paid Bayer Leverkusen for him 10 years ago.\nAdvertisement\nEven after Son\u2019s departure, there will be questions about a few other senior players, just in case offers come in that are worth Tottenham thinking about, such as Richarlison or Bissouma. But Cristian Romero, about whom there was so much speculation earlier in the window, looks set to stay.\nAtletico Madrid have given up on signing him and have already signed Slovakian international centre-back David Hancko from Feyenoord.\nBen Davies admitted there is uncertainty over his long-term future in an interview with The Athletic. However, Frank has been impressed by the Wales international, who has featured regularly in pre-season at left-back. He values the 32-year-old\u2019s experience and mentality. Frank believes he is a positive influence within the dressing room and is considering him for a role in the leadership group.\nBentancur has entered the final year of his contract, and Frank has been full of praise for him, too. He thinks the Uruguay international can be a key player long-term. If so, Spurs need to start discussions over a new deal if they haven\u2019t already.\nElsewhere, there is the possibility of younger players leaving Spurs, with Alfie Devine and Dane Scarlett still waiting for loan deals.\nJack Pitt-Brooke and Jay Harris\nBarcelona\nWhat happened this week?\nBarcelona came to the end of their pre-season tour on Monday with a convincing 5-0 win against Daegu FC, with Marcus Rashford scoring his first goal in a Barcelona shirt.\nLast week, they beat Seoul FC 7-3 with Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scoring two goals each. The Catalans ended their trip to Japan and South Korea with 15 goals scored across three games.\nNow they return to Barcelona to finalise their work before the start of La Liga. They will face Como at home next Sunday in the traditional Joan Gamper pre-season trophy.\nMeanwhile, Marc-Andre ter Stegen underwent surgery on his back injury successfully last week. Now it will be up to La Liga to determine if the goalkeeper\u2019s injury can be considered long-term, and therefore free up salary space to register a new Barca player.\nWho are Barcelona at risk of not being able to register?\nThe list is not short. All new signings from this summer need to be included: Joan Garcia, Marcus Rashford and Roony Bardghji. There\u2019s Wojciech Szczesny, too. Finally, Barcelona have to register Gerard Martin. The left-back played last season while being registered as an academy player, but after a significant number of appearances under Hansi Flick, La Liga will now force Barcelona to include him in their first team.\nAdvertisement\nThe number one priority in that department is Garcia. Barcelona want to get his registration resolved as soon as possible, and club president Joan Laporta said during the pre-season tour last week that they are working on it.\n\u201cAll the registrations are progressing adequately. It is better to work in silence and not speak too much about it in public,\u201d said Laporta on Saturday.\nAn element that could have an impact on registrations is Ter Stegen\u2019s injury. The German goalkeeper underwent surgery on his back last week in France. Now, Barcelona are expected to submit medical reports to La Liga, who will assess them. La Liga\u2019s independent medical panel will evaluate the injury and decide whether it can be deemed as a long-term injury. This would mean an expected recovery time of at least four months. If they do, Barcelona would be in a position to use 80 per cent of Ter Stegen\u2019s salary to register a new player.\n\u201cJoan Garcia\u2019s registration does not depend on Ter Stegen,\u201d Laporta said on the weekend. \u201cBut his absence, given it is an important injury, could provide a more straightforward way to register him\u201d.\nWith Rashford and Szczesny, the club maintain they will eventually be registered without any major sale completed. In the case of Bardghji, Barcelona are aware they could potentially register the Swedish winger as a Barcelona Atletic player if there\u2019s no room for him as a first-team one.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAccording to well-placed sources within the club, Barcelona are done with signings in this transfer window.\nAfter the arrivals of Garcia, Szczesny, Rashford and Bardghji, Laporta and Deco do not expect any other major arrivals this summer, and they are now focused on registrations.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nHector Fort is the only first-team player with a big chance of leaving. The 19-year-old right-back has lost his place in Flick\u2019s priority list in his position to Eric Garcia, who was fantastic last season when he was required in the role.\nThere is practically no game time in sight for Fort, which pushed Barca and Flick to tell the player it would be best for him to find a new club. Although Fort did not intend to leave initially, Barcelona\u2019s clarity over his role has made him reconsider. The club are searching for a permanent sale, while aiming to keep close tabs on the defender with a buy-back clause.\nAdvertisement\nOn other names, there have been plenty of rumours in local media. The likes of Fermin Lopez and Marc Casado have been named as players who could raise interest abroad, and ones that Barcelona would be very willing to listen to offers for.\nHowever, the reality is that none of those players intend to leave \u2014 even knowing they are not close to having a starting role \u2014 and Flick is very happy to keep them. Barca won\u2019t actively push for a sale, and at this point club sources acknowledge that there is no major sale contemplated.\nFlick is going to have a deep squad to handle, which is certainly a luxury to have, but at the same time, can be a man-management challenge for the German.\nPol Ballus\nReal Madrid\nWhat happened this week?\nThere was no major movement in terms of signings, and this is not expected to change unless space is freed up in the squad. For now, no further departures are expected after the exits of academy players Chema Andres (Stuttgart), Jacobo Ramon (Como) and Mario Martin (Getafe) were confirmed.\nArgentina midfielder Franco Mastantuono arrived in Madrid on Sunday, although the 17-year-old is not expected to be officially presented until he turns 18 on August 14.\nDoes Xabi Alonso have the right squad for his style of play?\nAlthough in his last press conference in the United States \u2014 after the 4-0 Club World Cup semi-final defeat to Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 Alonso left the door open to further improving the squad, the signings that have been made are in line with his project.\nUpon his arrival at Madrid, the Basque coach played an active role in the signings of Alvaro Carreras, Dean Huijsen and Mastantuono, all of whom he called to convince them to join. My colleague Mario Cortegana understands from sources close to the coaching setup that Alonso feels there is still room for improvement. One source suggests Alonso and his staff would like two signings, possibly one to replace Rodrygo in case the Brazilian leaves. The club\u2019s view is that the team has been built with Alonso in mind.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAlthough Madrid are always keeping an eye on the market and evaluating players, it is not clear if they have anyone specific in mind for the rest of the transfer window.\nSources who have recently been in contact with the club tell The Athletic they have been looking at options for midfield, but none of them have been fully convincing. In contrast, club sources insist the squad is closed to any more arrivals and that Alonso will have to adapt to what is available.\nAdvertisement\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAlthough both the club and Alonso are open to Rodrygo leaving, there have been no developments in his case and, according to sources close to the player, the Brazilian has indicated he wants to stay. My colleague Mario Cortegana has been told by sources close to the coaching staff that Alonso and his team are not entirely happy with Rodrygo. The player is working with intermediary Pini Zahavi this summer, which could indicate he is not so clear about his position at the club.\nBoth Endrick and Gonzalo Garcia are keen to stay. According to a source close to Gonzalo, the striker\u2019s agent, Oscar Ribot, is working on an extension and an improvement to his contract after his impressive performances at the Club World Cup.\nThe club has not yet announced who will wear the No 9 shirt, which is telling. Club sources say the decision is yet to be made.\nFrench left-back Ferland Mendy intends to stay at Madrid and compete with Carreras and Fran Garcia, but his camp is surprised the club has not yet announced his contract renewal (which, as The Athletic reported at the time, was finalised last year).\nMadrid retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause for the 20-year-old midfielder Nico Paz after his sale to Como last year. This year, Madrid have decided to waive their buy-back clause \u2014 they can re-sign him for \u20ac9m next year or \u20ac10m in 2027. Como have intended to buy out Madrid\u2019s sell-on rights for months after seeing a lot of potential in Paz last season.\nAccording to various sources involved in negotiations, there is no clause in the current agreement as to how Como could do that. When the idea was first raised a few months ago, sources at Madrid rejected the idea of losing control over a player they see as a potential star.\nReinier Jesus is set to join Atletico Mineiro in his native Brazil. The Athletic reported last week that they were the best-placed suitors for the 23-year-old. Reinier, who joined for \u20ac30m from Flamengo in 2020 and has never played for Madrid\u2019s first team, is expected to sign until December 2029 for the Brazilian side. Madrid will not receive any money but will retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause.\nGuillermo Rai\n(Top photos: Maryam Majd/Getty Images, David Klein/AP Photo; design: Dan Goldfarb)"

      "text": "Gonzalo Garcia has signed a new Real Madrid contract through to 2030.\nThe Athletic reported in the DealSheet on Tuesday Garcia\u2019s agent was working on an extension and an improvement to his deal after his impressive performances at the Club World Cup this summer.\nGarcia, 21, caught the eye during Madrid\u2019s run to the semi-finals of the tournament in the United States, scoring four times in six appearances \u2013 including the winner against Juventus in the round-of-16.\nAdvertisement\nThe plan this summer had initially been for the Spain youth international to depart in search of regular playing time, and he had doubts over his future at Madrid due to Endrick, 19, competing for the same position. But after enjoying an impressive Club World Cup, he is expected to remain with the first team, with Xabi Alonso an important factor in his decision to sign a new deal.\nThe striker progressed through the Madrid academy and has made 12 senior appearances for the club.\nHe featured three times from the bench in Madrid\u2019s final La Liga last season, recording an assist in the win over Sevilla in their penultimate game of the season.\nGarcia also scored the winner from the bench in the Copa del Rey quarter-final victory over Leganes.\nGarcia contract follows remarkable summer\nAnalysis by The Athletic\u2019s Tomas Hill Lopez-Menchero\nNot even Gonzalo Garcia could have predicted his past two months.\nBefore the Club World Cup, the 21-year-old\u2019s standout moment in a Real Madrid shirt had been a late header against Leganes to send his side through to the Copa del Rey semi-finals in February. But his achievements in the United States made everyone sit up and take notice.\nWith Kylian Mbappe missing through illness and Endrick through injury, Gonzalo proved himself a more than capable replacement No 9. There was his opener in the first game against Al Hilal, an assist in the next game against Pachuca and then three efforts in a row to help beat RB Salzburg, Juventus in the round of 16 and Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals. His goal against Juventus was the pick of the bunch, a guided header from a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross that drew comparisons with Madrid great Raul.\nThose were no surprise given the legendary former striker was Gonzalo\u2019s coach last season with Real Madrid Castilla, when he scored a record 25 goals in a campaign for the reserve side. Gonzalo revealed after the Juventus game that Raul still texts him after every match and called it \u201ca great compliment to be compared to him\u201d while \u201crespecting the distances\u201d between them.\nNobody is suggesting Gonzalo can reach those levels just yet. But with Endrick\u2019s form erratic and Jude Bellingham absent after his shoulder surgery, the kid from the academy could be just what Xabi Alonso needs to break down stubborn opponents.\n(Photo: Luke Hales/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Endrick will wear the No 9 shirt for Real Madrid next season.\nThe shirt number was vacant after former wearer Kylian Mbappe switched to the No 10 shirt in July.\nReports had suggested that 21-year-old striker Gonzalo Garcia may inherit the No 9. However, The Athletic can reveal that it is expected to be handed to Endrick instead.\nThe Brazil international will join a list of names including Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Ronaldo to wear the No 9 shirt for Real Madrid.\nEndrick officially joined Real Madrid last summer from Palmeiras. Wearing the number 16 shirt, Endrick scored seven goals and provided one assist over 37 games in his debut season in the Spanish capital. The forward missed his side\u2019s Club World Cup campaign, where they lost 4-0 in the semi final to Paris Saint-Germain, due to a leg injury. He is aiming to play again in mid-September and is expected to stay at the club.\nReal Madrid begin their La Liga campaign against Osasuna at the Santiago Bernabeu on August 19.\nWhat are the most important shirt numbers at Madrid?\nAnalysis by Guillermo Rai\nThe most significant shirt at Madrid is without doubt the No 7.\nIt has been worn by icons from practically every era who are closely associated with the club, including Amancio Amaro, the late Juanito (who died in a car accident at 37), Emilio Butragueno, Raul and, of course, Cristiano Ronaldo. It is currently occupied by Vinicius Junior.\nAdvertisement\nThat is why No 10 \u2014 usually the most important number at any other club, including Barcelona \u2014 is second on Madrid\u2019s list. It has mostly been worn by midfielders or creative players such as Raymond Kopa, Ferenc Puskas, Michael Laudrup, Clarence Seedorf, Luis Figo, Mesut Ozil, and, until this summer, Luka Modric.\nAs at any other club, 9 is also highly sought after. It was worn by Alfredo di Stefano, who led Madrid to win the first five European Cups, while other centre-forwards to have become synonymous with it include Hugo Sanchez, Ronaldo Nazario and Karim Benzema.\nMbappe wore it in his debut season with the club (as did Cristiano Ronaldo when he arrived from Manchester United, before Raul left the No 7 vacant).\nCuriously, Madrid last won the Champions League in 2024 without a No 9 \u2014 which was vacant after Benzema\u2019s exit to Saudi Pro League side Al Ittihad \u2014 the first campaign that had happened in their history.\nWhat have been the best-selling shirts in recent years?\nThe club do not make these numbers public, but various Spanish media outlets have reported Mbappe is the player to have sold the most shirts since his arrival in the summer of 2024.\nPreviously, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr were at the top of that list \u2014 and those three are the most commonly seen shirts on matchday at the Bernabeu.\nHow are La Liga rules on shirt numbers different to other European leagues?\nIn La Liga, players can only choose a shirt number between 1 and 25. Goalkeepers must wear No 1, 13 or 25, although Madrid\u2019s first team only have two goalkeepers in Thibaut Courtois (who wears No 1) and Andriy Lunin (13).\nWhen shirt numbers were first introduced in Spain in 1947, the numbers 1 to 11 were the only ones available and were usually chosen based on a player\u2019s position.\nLa Liga\u2019s rules on shirt numbers are seen as being stricter than the Premier League, Serie A and Ligue 1, which all allow players to choose shirt numbers between 1 and 99.\nAdvertisement\nWhy did Mbappe change to No 10 and how are shirt numbers decided at Madrid?\nClub sources \u2014 who, like all those cited in this article, asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships \u2014 told The Athletic that, with the No 10 free after Modric\u2019s exit at the end of his contract, they offered Mbappe the opportunity to wear the same number he does for France as it is a \u201cvery special number\u201d for a \u201cvery special\u201d player.\nMbappe himself confirmed the news on social media and his relationship with the No 10 goes back a long way. In an autobiographical comic book he released in 2021, the player is shown as a child unwrapping a Real Madrid shirt with the same number for Christmas.\nThe number of years a player has served at the club can be a factor in which players are given their preferred numbers. Even so, Madrid always have the final say.\nFor instance, sources close to Arda Guler said he wanted the No 10 before it was given to Mbappe \u2014 he has been at the club for a year longer than Mbappe but was overruled.\nEndrick has now been handed Mbappe\u2019s old number in what seems to be a significant show of faith in the young Brazilian striker.\nAre there any other numbers with special significance at Madrid?\nThe No 4 was worn by legendary captains Fernando Hierro and Sergio Ramos \u2014 it is considered to be so important that David Alaba, its current wearer, called Ramos to ask for his permission to take it when he joined in 2021, the same summer the Spaniard left.\nAccording to sources close to Dean Huijsen, the Dutch-born Spain international would love to wear it in the future too.\nOf the more unusual cases, Zinedine Zidane made the No 5 iconic when he arrived at the height of the \u2018galacticos\u2019 era in 2001. He was not able to wear 10 as it had already been taken by Luis Figo following his controversial move from Barcelona a year earlier.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Jude Bellingham joined in 2023, he asked Jesus Vallejo for permission to wear 5, given his admiration of Zidane.\nAnother number with special significance in recent years is 23, which David Beckham wore during his four-year spell at the Bernabeu from 2003-2007.\nIt reflected the club\u2019s expanding commercial strategy and was the same number with which NBA icon Michael Jordan made history with the Chicago Bulls.\n(Photo: David Ramos/Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of Crystal Palace vs Liverpool in the Community Shield\nBad misses and superior finishes. After three years of fighting the fight for Liverpool to varying degrees of success, Darwin Nunez is not just leaving Anfield but the European football scene entirely.\nThe 26-year-old is set for a medical with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Al Hilal after the clubs agreed a deal worth \u20ac53million (\u00a346.3m, $61.9m) plus add-ons. It means Nunez will leave right in the middle of what can often prove to be a striker\u2019s peak years, having scored 40 goals and provided 23 assists in 143 appearances for Liverpool.\nAdvertisement\nHe was fantastically entertaining to watch\u2026 but not always just for Liverpool fans.\nIt would usually start with a swing and a miss \u2014 and then the chants would come. \u201cS*** Andy Carroll, you\u2019re just a s*** Andy Carroll!\u201d.\nThe Uruguay international\u2019s struggles with the language barrier early on at Liverpool are well documented but he always seemed to understand what that meant. Whether he was being targeted from an away end at Anfield or all four stands when Liverpool were away, those lyrics seemed to have a profound impact on him.\nDuring a Carabao Cup match at Bournemouth in November 2023, Nunez, in his second season at Liverpool, came on in the 61st minute and was greeted with a rendition of that particular song by the home crowd. Nine minutes later, in a game during which the rain from Storm Ciaran had blown into the tiny Vitality Stadium sideways, Nunez cut infield and bent a shot into the top corner to score a vengeful winner.\nBournemouth fans were not the first or last to learn that taunting him often prompted his best work. Abuse was the precursor to many a payback goal.\n\u201cNunez! Nunez! Nunez!\u201d was Liverpool fans\u2019 riposte. He never got a chant longer than his own surname (which was consistently mispronounced: it\u2019s Noon-yez, not Noonez), but he didn\u2019t need one. His name was first shouted at him like that after he scored against Manchester City when Liverpool won the Community Shield at the start of the 2022-23 season. Nunez and the fans, who would point at him as they bellowed his name, bonded right from the off.\nBut if Liverpool fans didn\u2019t know that fellow striker Erling Haaland, who joined City from Germany\u2019s Borussia Dortmund that same summer, was a different beast, they would soon find out.\nEven though their head-to-head battle began with Nunez scoring and Haaland misfiring that August afternoon, the former was at a loss as soon as the comparisons began with the Norwegian.\nAlmost as soon as Nunez joined from Benfica of Portugal in an \u00a385million deal in June 2022, three weeks after Liverpool almost ended their season by winning every trophy on offer, he was pitted against Haaland.\nIt was billed as a new sub-rivalry within an ongoing feud as Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp continued to look for inventive ways to overthrow Pep Guardiola\u2019s City dynasty. But Nunez did not arrive in England as the finished article. Klopp, who had pushed so hard to sign him, often looked frustrated trying to help his striker find those finishing touches.\nAdvertisement\nNunez\u2019s up-and-downness could be draining to watch but Liverpool always clung on in expectation of his next moment of magic. When it arrived, in whatever way, shape or form, they would worship it.\nOn his day, he was the backheel finisher Real Madrid did not see coming in the Champions League. But he could also make a bulldozing run, get around the goalkeeper, see an open goal beckoning him and somehow clank a shot against the post, as he did in the Europa League against Toulouse.\nRyan Gravenberch scored the rebound to spare his blushes on that particular occasion, but Nunez still knowingly dropped to his knees, with head in hands. He was aware he was battling an army of social media trolls who sat waiting to laugh at him. It was harsh, and led Nunez to avoid social media entirely. He was persistent, though, and demonstrated an impressive capacity to bounce back.\nFor some, he will be remembered more for those big misses, such as the one against Ajax in the Champions League during his first season when he hit the post from five yards out, or at Luton Town when, from even closer to the target, he scooped the ball up and over the crossbar.\nFor many Liverpool supporters, he will be remembered as a Premier League champion, as someone who was out injured at the time but went hurtling onto the pitch faster than anyone when, in Klopp\u2019s final campaign, Liverpool won the Carabao Cup final.\nLiverpool have been mocked by rival fans for their use of \u201cThis means more\u201d as a tagline. But when Nunez scored, it didn\u2019t just mean more, it meant everything. Every single one of the club\u2019s supporters wanted to see him reach the heights they believed he was capable of. And when he celebrated with the kind of passion that could leave pitchside advertising boards broken, they did too.\nHe would kiss his wrist after every goal, reminiscent of his compatriot and Liverpool striking predecessor Luis Suarez. When Nunez joined, there was hope he could emulate Suarez, who scored 82 goals in 133 games for the club in three and a half seasons between January 2011 and July 2014 \u2014 and he did get off to the perfect start.\nAdvertisement\nA week after winning the Community Shield, he came off the bench for his Premier League debut in the opening game of the Premier League season to score one himself and then assist Mohamed Salah for the other in a 2-2 away draw against Fulham. The next week, in his home league debut, he emulated Suarez for the wrong reasons when losing his cool and headbutting Crystal Palace defender Joachim Andersen, leaving Liverpool a goal and a player down in a match that ended 1-1.\nPerhaps those first two Premier League appearances sum him up best.\nEvolution became an overused term when discussing this man named Darwin but ultimately Liverpool, under Klopp\u2019s successor Arne Slot, moved on without him. Last season, he totted up as many yellow cards (eight) as goal contributions (scoring five, with three assists) in his 30 Premier League games. He started eight of those matches, the last of them at home against Southampton on March 8.\nWatching Nunez play was like a sport within a sport and you had to be patient, especially when watching him trying to time a run. Only Dominic Calvert-Lewin (70) of Everton was flagged offside more often (62) in the Premier League over the past three seasons.\nAnd while Liverpool fans might be left feeling short-changed, Nunez did deliver some all-time memorable moments.\nHis two identical finishes to earn a comeback win in stoppage time against Newcastle in August 2023 showed the South American at his best. A goal scored off his backside when rushing at Sheffield United goalkeeper Ivo Grbic the following April was him at his hungriest. His stoppage-time brace away to Brentford in January helped earn a dramatic 2-0 victory during their race for a 20th top-flight title.\nIn fact, he scored (nine) and assisted (nine) more times for Liverpool in the final 15 minutes of games than he managed during any other time period of that size. He was a roll of the dice who the club can no longer look to. But in selling him, they could be about to invest that money into the signing of Newcastle\u2019s top scorer Alexander Isak, which would be a great parting gift.\nAdvertisement\nNunez also scored five times this pre-season, the last of them at the Kop end in a 4-1 win against Athletic Club on Monday, tapping at the club badge on his shirt as his final celebration in red. With his new shaved-head look replacing the ponytail of old and more than a hint of flair, he also assisted a Harvey Elliott goal.\nLike all good showmen, he has left Liverpool fans wanting more \u2014 for Nunez, that was always the problem.\n(Top photo: James Gill/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Newcastle United are considering a move for Porto striker Samu Aghehowa.\nThe 21-year-old is high among the small number of options Newcastle are considering to bolster their attack this summer after missing out on several targets.\nThe club are yet to make a formal approach, and there is no guarantee that the move will happen, but Aghehowa is a player liked by Newcastle.\nBrentford\u2019s Yoane Wissa and Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 Jorgen Strand Larsen are also considered options for the Tyneside club. Wolves, however, consider Strand Larsen as not for sale.\nAghehowa, formerly known as Omorodion, scored 27 goals across 45 appearances in his debut season at Porto. He scored twice against Manchester United in the group stage of the Europa League last season as Porto came from behind to draw 3-3.\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle had pursued RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko and had a bid of \u20ac82.5m (\u00a371.5m) plus \u20ac2.5m in add-ons accepted by Leipzig on Tuesday. However, the Slovenia international favoured a move to Manchester United, who have agreed a fee of \u20ac76.5m and \u20ac8.5m in add-ons, with Sesko being given permission to travel for a medical.\nNewcastle\u2019s search for a striker comes amid uncertainty over Alexander Isak\u2019s future, with Newcastle rejecting a formal of \u00a3110m from Liverpool for the Swedish forward.\nSpeaking on Sunday, head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle are \u201cnot deluded\u201d and recognise the urgent need for transfer reinforcements ahead of the new season.\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool), Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United), Liam Delap, Joao Pedro (both Chelsea), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid) and James Trafford (Manchester City) have moved elsewhere, rather than Tyneside, during the current window.\nLast summer, Chelsea agreed a \u00a334.5m deal with Atletico Madrid to sign Aghehowa, but the proposed move collapsed and he subsequently joined Porto in a \u20ac15m deal.\nAghehowa signed a five-year contract with Porto, which contains a \u20ac100m release clause, through to 2029.\nThe striker, who has played twice for Spain, never made a first-team appearance for Atletico, spending 2023-24 on loan at Alaves \u2014 where he scored eight goals \u2014 having come through the youth system at Granada, scoring in his only appearance for the club.\nPorto have added depth up front this summer with the signing of Luuk de Jong from PSV.\nWho is Samu Aghehowa?\nAnalysis from Liam Twomey in The Radar\nJust as he had made himself a household name in Porto, the striker formerly known as Samu Omorodion decided to change it.\nIn mid-November, having scored 12 goals in his first 12 appearances since arriving from Atletico Madrid, the striker who had come close to signing for Chelsea in the summer of 2024 made it clear that he no longer wanted to be known by his father\u2019s surname. He would instead be Samu Aghehowa, in honour of the great love and debt of gratitude he feels towards his mother.\nAdvertisement\nEdith Aghehowa made the fateful decision to leave Nigeria while pregnant with Samu and travel to Spain, eventually settling in Seville.\n\u201cI changed my surname because my mother gave us life and risked her life to raise us,\u201d he explained in an interview with Spanish newspaper El Periodico in June. \u201cShe gave everything so that my sister and I could have the best life possible. She deserved to be known by her surname. She deserves everything and I hope to do great things so that her name is known.\u201d\nHe has unequivocally made a great start, scoring 25 goals in 39 appearances across the Primeira Liga and Europa League, in only his second full season in professional football \u2014 one that was almost over by the time he celebrated his 21st birthday in the first week of May.\nThere was impressive variety in those goals: poacher\u2019s efforts, cool breakaway finishes, back-post tap-ins, deft headers (most memorably the one that brought Porto level with Manchester United in a 3-3 draw at Estadio do Dragao in October) and even an overhead kick.\nFurther from goal, Aghehowa already displays good knowledge of how to use his powerful 6ft 4in (193cm) frame to hold off defenders. Sometimes, he then deploys a burst of acceleration to spin away. On other occasions, he flashes a good feel for linking or switching the play, or laying the ball off for team-mates in his proximity.\nBut at the heart of his game is power, directness, and a hunger for goals, making plenty of runs in behind the defensive line and into the box to get on the end of crosses (as the blue spikes illustrate below).\nThese are key ingredients that make up any complete modern No 9, and Aghehowa\u2019s progress provided perhaps the brightest spark in a disappointing season for Porto, who finished a distant third in the Primeira Liga.\nThe old name will be forgotten at his request. The new one might be worth remembering.\n(David Ramos/Getty Images)"

      "text": "This is an updated version of an article first published in September 2024.\nIn December 2019, Reinier Jesus was asked to attend a meeting with his family and representatives at the hotel South American champions Flamengo were using as their base for the old Club World Cup in Qatar. The then 17-year-old Brazilian playmaker couldn\u2019t hide his excitement when he was told Real Madrid were strongly interested in signing him.\nAdvertisement\nReinier had paved the way for an exit after an affordable release clause was inserted into his latest contract with Flamengo \u2014 \u20ac30million ($35m; \u00a326m at current exchange rates), which would rise to \u20ac35m in July 2020 and \u20ac70m in January 2021 if he stayed with the Rio de Janeiro club that long. But the plan had been to move to a smaller European team than Madrid initially, with Borussia Dortmund of Germany, Dutch side Ajax and Everton all in a good position to sign him.\nMadrid blew those plans out of the water. They beat Manchester City to Reinier\u2019s signature in 2020 after his father went to visit the Premier League club\u2019s facilities. Other English sides had shown interest, while there were a few enquiries from Madrid\u2019s city rivals Atletico. But Reinier opted for the record European champions, following the route taken by his compatriots Vinicius Junior (a \u20ac45m signing from Flamengo announced in 2017) and Rodrygo (\u20ac40m from fellow Brazilians Santos in 2018).\nThat seems a long time ago now. Having just returned from a fourth unsuccessful loan, Reinier has left to join Atletico Mineiro in his homeland for free, as first reported by The Athletic. He did not make a single appearance for Madrid\u2019s senior team in his five years on their books. Madrid retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause as part of the deal.\nThis is the story of Madrid\u2019s forgotten Brazilian wonderkid.\nAfter Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo\u2019s arrivals, Reinier\u2019s signing was part of a clear strategy from Madrid to attract the best possible young talent \u2014 particularly from Brazil \u2014 after president Florentino Perez\u2019s frustration at missing out on Neymar to Barcelona in 2013.\nThat policy was led by Juni Calafat, a Spanish-Brazilian executive at Madrid who is now their chief scout. After Calafat\u2019s trusted staff in Brazil singled out Reinier as someone worth watching, he won over the player\u2019s family with visits there to forge a good relationship. The allure of playing for Madrid did the rest.\nReinier had a few days off between that pre-Christmas Club World Cup and South America\u2019s Under-23 Pre-Olympic tournament, staged in Colombia in the January and February. That was when he received a call from his father telling him the deal with Madrid had been agreed.\nThey would pay Reinier\u2019s \u20ac30m release clause, with 80 per cent of the money going to Flamengo, 10 per cent to the family and the remaining 10 per cent to the player\u2019s agent. Reinier, and his family, immediately started studying Spanish. He would join Castilla for the remainder of that 2019-20 season with a further six years on his deal.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, which shut down the world in the spring of 2020, affected Reinier\u2019s start at Madrid.\nReinier scored two goals and provided an assist in three appearances for Castilla before the season was paused in March due to the pandemic, eventually resuming three months later.\nReinier spent his time during lockdown training at home and in the May then-coach Zinedine Zidane called him up to join first-team training, where it became clear that he did not have a place in the senior squad but was already too good for Castilla.\nHe left on a two-year loan to Dortmund that summer, a deal including an option to buy, after multiple clubs showed interest in him \u2014 Madrid only agreed to that length as they felt it would encourage the Germans to bid for Reinier. Dortmund would also pay a \u20ac5m loan fee.\nBut his spell in the Bundesliga did not go to plan.\nReinier considered cutting short the loan in January 2021 due to a lack of game time and, despite seeing that first season out, he only had 340 minutes of action in 19 appearances. Dortmund approached Madrid about the possibility of signing him permanently later that year, but they rejected the offer. He then won a gold medal with Brazil at the delayed Tokyo Olympics that August, but played just 405 minutes in 20 games in year two with Dortmund.\nMadrid soon realised clubs were far more likely to give opportunities to players who had joined them permanently rather than on loan. Since then, they have often preferred to sell their young players while putting affordable buy-back clauses and a first right of refusal into their deals.\nFor Reinier, that policy came too late. He tried to get his career back on track with a loan to La Liga newcomers Girona in the 2022-23 season, but injuries hampered his development. Despite showing some promising signs, he scored just twice and provided one assist in 620 minutes of action across 18 games.\nAdvertisement\nIn the summer of 2023, Madrid again looked for a loan club for Reinier who were willing to cover a large part of the player\u2019s salary of around \u20ac3m net per year. When that did not materialise, the player had limited options. He joined Frosinone in Serie A on deadline day, scoring three goals and providing two assists in 23 appearances for a side eventually relegated.\nLast summer was not easy either.\nReinier contacted Madrid in July to find out when he was due to start pre-season and received a reply on the 15th of that month. Days later, he found out he would be considered a player for Castilla once more rather than the first team this season when a specialist from Raul\u2019s staff \u2014 the legendary Madrid striker was then coaching the side \u2014 wrote to him asking him if he needed a training plan. The Brazilian said he had already been working with a personal trainer in his home country. Raul did everything to try and keep him for the second team but Reinier wanted to progress elsewhere.\nThere were few offers for the playmaker, given his performances and Madrid\u2019s request for any loan club to cover a large chunk of his salary. Norwich City were in a good position to sign him, but the player wanted to wait in case he was able to stay in Spain.\nGranada emerged as late contenders for Reinier\u2019s signature and welcomed him as a \u2018Rei\u2019 or king, with their announcement post showing him sitting on a throne with a lion next to him in the city\u2019s iconic Alhambra palace.\nBut he scored just once and provided four assists in 24 appearances in the second tier. He was largely left out in the second half of the season as Granada went through three different managers \u2014 Guillermo Abascal, Fran Escriba and Jose Rojo \u2018Pacheta\u2019 Martin \u2014 and narrowly missed out on the promotion play-offs. Sources close to Reinier say the experience made him \u201cmore experienced and stronger\u201d, even if they admit he could have scored more goals and that the team\u2019s fight to reach La Liga complicated things.\nAdvertisement\nReinier had been upset with his constantly changing situation and did not feel supported by Madrid, who were barely in contact with him during these deals. He still believes in his quality but knew for some time that a future with them was no longer viable. Madrid and Castilla were both contacted for comment.\nBut there did not appear to be any ill feeling in Reinier\u2019s post on Instagram after his move to Atletico Mineiro was announced.\nView this post on Instagram\n\u201cAt 18 years old I landed in Spain to fulfil my childhood dream: to play football in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the club that made all this possible was no less than Real Madrid, the greatest in the world and my team since childhood!\n\u201cIn the last five years that I was in Spain, Germany and Italy, I learned at clubs that made me grow a lot as a person and as a professional.\n\u201cI know none of this would have been possible without the valuable opportunity Madrid gave me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why today I end my contract with a heart full of pride, gratitude and with a calm conscience!\u201d\nReinier would not have envisaged going back to Brazil without making a senior appearance for Madrid when he first joined five years ago. Sadly for him, it had been that way for a while.\n(Top photo: Reinier at his Real Madrid presentation; Burak Akbulut/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)"

      "text": "The first-team gym at RB Leipzig\u2019s Cottaweg training facility is upstairs, fronted by floor-to-ceiling windows.\nIt sits opposite the youth team gym, which is designed in the same way, and is meant to be aspirational. It allows the younger players to look across, to see the stars and glimpse their future.\nAdvertisement\nOver the past two years, those academy prospects will have seen Benjamin Sesko working away, packing his fascinating dimensions with as much power as possible and preparing for this moment: the completion of his \u20ac85million move to Manchester United.\nTalk to anyone who has encountered Sesko on his path through the game and themes repeat. He is relentless. He is driven. He is deeply ambitious. Off the pitch, those who know him describe a normal person with few airs and graces. It\u2019s not particularly Slovenian to swagger, and Sesko does not carry himself like a star.\nBut he is one. And has been for some time. Sesko is a national icon in a country where sporting celebrity is something new. Alongside Luka Doncic, the five-time NBA All-Star, and Tadej Pogacar, who recently won his fourth Tour de France, he is the third member of an athletic super class.\nBut the move to Manchester United will make him a global, as well as national property, and Miran Zore, a reporter and editor for Nogomania, one of Slovenia\u2019s largest football websites, describes the impact of that transfer.\n\u201cFor a small country like ours, this is huge news,\u201d Zore tells The Athletic.\n\u201cWe only have one Premier League player, Jaka Bijol of Leeds United (who joined from Udinese this summer), so this will have an enormous impact. Our biggest star in world football is our goalkeeper, Jan Oblak, but other than we don\u2019t have any \u2014 apart from Sesko.\u201d\n\u201cAnd with him having a big role at such a big club, it will change things here a lot. The Premier League is very different to Leipzig. But he has already had an impact. Even now.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not used to big stars in Slovenia, we are not particularly fanatical. We are not a country where football shirts are sold in great quantities. It\u2019s not like in the UK, where people buy a new one every season. Here, you buy a jersey and then you stick with it. But with Sesko, everything is changing. I see a lot of people now with his name on their jerseys. At national team matches, of course, but also on the beach. And this is totally new here.\u201d\nNew, but building for some time. Sesko became a senior international the day after his 18th birthday and, at 22, has already made 41 appearances for his country.\nHe\u2019s come a long way already, even before this next giant step up into the game\u2019s stratosphere.\nSesko comes from Radece, a small valley town of a few thousand people, an hour\u2019s drive from Ljubljana. It sits in the cradle of the Sava Hills, by a river of the same name that runs for 944 kilometres south east, through Croatia, forming its border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and all the way into Serbia.\nIt\u2019s no footballing heartland, but it\u2019s idyllic and beautiful, and Sesko joined the local club, NK Radece, when he was four years old.\nHis father, Ales, played for Radece as a goalkeeper and their first team play on a pitch surrounded by a running track, beyond which there\u2019s a tennis court, a skate ramp, and seating for a few dozen spectators.\nAdvertisement\nToday, Sesko\u2019s picture sits at the foot of their website, with his progress through the game charted alongside. That graphic will soon need to be resized to accommodate Manchester United\u2019s famous crest. If Radece make a big deal of him, then it\u2019s because he\u2019s been a gigantic success and a source of great pride. Handball is the most popular sport in a region which traditionally does not produce footballers and yet, by the time his career finishes, Sesko will likely be the most famous player in his country\u2019s history.\nSesko has been nationally known since he was 14. \u201cSensation!\u201d ran the headline in Ekipa, one of the country\u2019s largest sports dailies, atop a December 2017 article that was reporting on the scoring feats of a forward playing for the u15 side of second-division Krsko.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure that you\u2019ve not heard of Benjamin Sesko yet,\u201d it read, \u201cand that\u2019s not a surprise because he\u2019s 14. However, his talents cannot be overlooked. Sesko, who will celebrate his fifteenth birthday in May, has scored an astonishing 45 goals in just 15 matches in the first half of this season.\u201d\nBy the end of the year, it was 59 goals in 23 matches. Sesko scored nine hat-tricks and averaged a goal every 27 minutes.\nMirsad Mujakic coached Krsko\u2019s u15 side during that league season.\n\u201cBeni came to us when he was 13,\u201d he tells The Athletic.\n\u201cWe scouted him and invited him to our academy. When he arrived, he was extremely tall already and also very thin, but he had great athletic abilities.\n\u201cHe looked more like a basketball player than a football player but it was clear from the very first training session how strong he was and how he could score different goals from all types of positions.\n\u201cHe was very laidback, but on the field he was completely changed. More concentrated, more focused. I remember his first game for us against NS Mura in the under-15 league, when we won 4-1 and he scored a hat-trick. He was absolutely excellent.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhile Sesko\u2019s early size made him stand out and his goals quickly put him on the national media\u2019s radar, the traits that Mujakic remembers are the ones that have really spurred his progress.\n\u201cHis biggest strengths then were his natural athleticism, but also his technical mastery \u2014 his first touch and the speed of his first movement that gave him such an advantage over his opponent. In those days, his biggest weakness was his heading. That\u2019s what we devoted the most time to when we practised. But he always learnt new technical skills very quickly and that allowed him to develop and improve fast.\n\u201cBut he is also an exceptional person. He likes to socialise with everyone \u2014 after every match in the Slovenian national team, he stays until the end and gives autographs to all the children.\n\u201cAnd his potential is unlimited, because he is such a dedicated worker. He will do everything and more to succeed \u2014 and that\u2019s why I think he will quickly show why he is among the best strikers in the world. Anyone who doubts his quality will change their mind after a few games.\u201d\nSesko\u2019s path through Slovenian football was serene, but he would never make a senior domestic appearance. He left Krsko in 2018, when he was 15, before spending a season with NK Domzale, for whose youth team he scored 21 goals in 23 appearances, attracting interest across Europe.\nManchester United were among those clubs and had an offer of \u00a31m rejected in the summer of 2019. Ultimately, Red Bull Salzburg won the race to sign him, bringing him inside the Red Bull network for the first time, before loaning him to FC Liefering, their development club in the Austrian 2. Liga.\nIn 2019, Bo Svensson was also new. The Dane would later coach Mainz and Union Berlin in the Bundesliga, but his first head coaching role in senior football was with Liefering. As talented as Sesko was, he tells The Athletic, handling him at that stage of his career required some finesse.\n\u201cBenji arrived as a 16-year-old,\u201d Svensson says, \u201cand with two other players who they (Salzburg) had also picked up at 16. So, it was new for me to train such young guys and to play them against seniors. And especially because there were a lot of eyes on those guys from senior people at the club.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSesko was not immediately successful. He barely played during his first six months and scored just one 2. Liga goal all season. There were mishaps. In his third appearance, he came on as an 85th-minute substitute against SV Horn and was sent off for violent conduct 60 seconds later.\n\u201cThere had always been a lot of attention on Benji and a lot of expectation on his shoulders and someone so young is not capable of coping with that,\u201d Svensson recalls. \u201cPlaying against adults was a completely different style for him. It was tactically different for him, too, and there was a lot to learn.\n\u201cBut I think the biggest challenge was the emotional side. Physically, he had always been beyond anybody else at his age. He had always jumped higher and run faster. Then he came to a stage where he was playing against 30-year-old men and he wasn\u2019t taller and wasn\u2019t stronger than them, and had to find different solutions.\n\u201cHe had to understand that everything wasn\u2019t always going as smoothly as it had before, and with all the expectation on him, not always playing in the beginning was something he had to adapt to. And he was putting enormous amounts of pressure on himself. He would want to train all the time and wanted to turn over every stone in an attempt to get better. Sometimes we had to stop him.\n\u201cBut you have to take pressure away from a young kid like and that\u2019s what I would tell him. We had a lot of talks. There was no doubt about his talent. That was obvious. But it was about time.\n\u201cHe was different to a lot of the young players I\u2019ve coached. Because of that ambition and determination to get better. He was just completely passionate about his football. Some players within that squad even struggled with him because he was so determined to get to the top and, in his position, you need to have ego to succeed.\u201d\nThe contrast between years one and two at Liefering was dramatic. One 2. Liga goal in 2019-20 became 21 in 29 appearances in a second season during which he also debuted for Salzburg, the parent club in the Austrian Bundesliga.\nBy 17, he had outgrown second-tier senior football, but Svensson does not remember any dramatic difference between those two years, more a natural evolution.\n\u201cIt was just normal development. It was important for him to have that hard time playing against adults and to realise that there are other good players,\u201d he says \u201cIt\u2019s also good for a player to understand that he has to do more, that he has to learn more and that it\u2019s not just enough to be doing what he has always done.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe trained a lot individually. But it wasn\u2019t like anything big happened. At some point, it just clicked and from there was never any doubt that he was going to break through.\n\u201cThere would be times when we had run-ins, because he was very ambitious and would think about himself and not always the team. But he was young and that was development, too. And I liked Benji a lot. It was a pleasure working with him because he was so special and had such love for the game. He\u2019s the biggest talent I\u2019ve coached.\u201d\nSesko\u2019s first full season back with Salzburg was, inconveniently, the one immediately following Erling Haaland\u2019s departure to Borussia Dortmund. Physical, quick, long-limbed but with excellent coordination and technique, the Slovenian has been destined to be compared to Haaland ever since. It\u2019s not something he encourages; he\u2019s his own player.\nIn any case, Sesko grew up idolising Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his is the most profound influence.\nBut a Premier League scout, who was granted anonymity to protect relationships, says that one of the traits all three players \u2014 Ibrahimovic, Haaland and Sesko \u2014 share, lies in their physical dexterity.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not like Haaland in terms of how he actually plays his position. But watch the way he receives the ball. Or watch how he receives it. He\u2019s so tall and is so agile that even if team-mates are inaccurate with their delivery, he\u2019s still able to do something with it,\u201d they say.\n\u201cThat includes his work in the penalty box, because there are times when he scores goals that only players with those physical properties could have scored. There\u2019s a technical element to that, but look at some of the photos of him off the ground. He takes the ball with his feet at what would be head-height for most players.\u201d\nStaff at Salzburg talk of Sesko fondly. One story concerns his first interview with Sky Austria, the national league\u2019s main rights holder. At the time, the club leased Audi A7s to players as part of a sponsor\u2019s agreement and, on the day the interview was scheduled, producers were waiting on set for the car to pull into view.\nAdvertisement\nIt never did. Instead, Sesko \u2014 all 6ft 5in of him \u2014 arrived, mantis-like, by e-scooter.\nThat story still makes people at the club laugh now, and Sesko is recalled as a humble, friendly person, initially shy, with the occasional idiosyncrasy. But the most vivid memories are preserved in the images described by the Premier League scout. These are commonplace now. There are pictures everywhere of Sesko killing the ball on his in-step, metres off the ground.\nBut at Salzburg, before anyone was watching, Sesko was already performing feats that were outrageous to most people, but which he made look startlingly easy. A first touch, a shot struck with unholy power, or just how quickly could he accelerate to top speed. In September 2022, a video appeared online showing a 14-year-old Sesko kicking a lodged basketball free from the rim with his foot.\n@nxgn.football Nope. Benjamin Sesko is not human \ud83e\udd2f This video is from when he was 14 years old! \ud83d\ude31 Even Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be proud \ud83e\udd1d \ud83d\udcf9: IG @pro_transfer_agency #fyp #football #basketball #footballtiktok #goal #soccer #zlatan #nba #sesko\nIt is something you could well imagine Ibrahimovic doing. Or, quietly, Haaland.\nHis transfer from Salzburg to Leipzig was arranged in 2022 and completed in 2023. In the two years since, he has grown more steadily in what, at times, has been a Leipzig team in transition. Sesko has scored goals in bursts and with memorable force and artistry, but not yet at a steady rhythm. He leaves the Bundesliga having become one of its better players, rather than one of its leading lights.\nBut he has been everything Leipzig have wanted him to be. Across conversations over the past two years, people who have worked in the footballing department and beyond have described him as a perfect, pliable pupil. His dedication and drive have been impressive and, through those French windows in the first team gym, have been clear for most to see.\nBut they like how he has challenged team-mates in the dressing room, and how he has treated people he has come into contact with, from coaches to the catering staff. He has been willing to listen. In meetings with coaches and on the training pitches, of course, but also to anyone from whom he can learn \u2014 about lifestyle, about media, about anything that can take him closer to the top of the game.\nAdvertisement\nAnd he\u2019s still learning now. There are mechanics to hone, more efficiency to find and greater consistency to discover. Manchester United will understand that. \u20ac85m has bought them a forward who must still develop, but who has so far always grown towards the sun.\n(Illustration: Kelsea Petersen / The Athletic; NurPhoto / Getty, Maja Hitji / Getty)"

      "text": "Ethan Nwaneri was born less than two miles from the Emirates Stadium at Whittington Hospital in March 2007. Now 18, he has signed a five-year contract to continue living the dream of a local boy surrounded by all things Arsenal.\nIslington in north London is Nwaneri\u2019s home. He went to primary school in Archway, spent his spare time playing football at Whittington Park, and can still be spotted by eagle-eyed residents of the Holloway area.\nJust last month, the England Under-21 international was helping to support his community at a boxing club.\nView this post on Instagram\nThe midfielder\u2019s first trip to the Emirates came courtesy of his uncle, who took him to an FA Youth Cup match as a four-year-old. Gunnersaurus, Arsenal\u2019s green dinosaur mascot, caught his eye and that was it.\nThe first senior Arsenal game he watched was their 3-1 Champions League last-16 home defeat against Monaco in February 2015. Thankfully, that night did not put him off.\nAdvertisement\nHe would become the first player born after the Emirates was built to represent Arsenal when he made his debut aged 15 in September 2022.\nA supreme talent, there was always going to be outside interest when he entered the final 12 months of his first professional deal. That was signed in 2024 and set at three years, the legal maximum for all players under 18. A well-known prospect in his early teens, he had interest from Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United before signing that deal.\nBut even when talks over this new deal became more delicate, Nwaneri wanted to stay and Arsenal wanted to keep him.\nHe spent time at Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur as a child, when getting a taste for multiple clubs is normal, but Nwaneri\u2019s pre-academy journey with Arsenal started as a five-year-old.\nHe would stay behind after his sessions at the academy base, Hale End, to watch Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe and others hone their skills as \u2018the older boys\u2019. He was joined by friend and team-mate Myles Lewis-Skelly. Together, they have evoked similar emotions from fans who watched Saka and Smith Rowe help establish Mikel Arteta\u2019s project.\nProducing these players can be symbolic for Arsenal. No matter their race, age or gender, supporters will identify with players who come through the ranks and excel. The fact Lewis-Skelly and Nwaneri are, in Nwaneri\u2019s words, \u201cso similar but so opposite at the same time\u201d almost makes their coexistence in the first team all the better. Lewis-Skelly is more extroverted but both have found ways to shine.\nFor Nwaneri, that comes through best when he plays as if he has not been coached. His first Premier League minutes at the Emirates, against Leicester City in September, gave regular match-goers their first proper taste of what that is like. On the pitch for seconds, his first action was to receive the ball in midfield, drive past two players and shoot from outside the box. His shot was saved, but with the score 2-2 in the dying embers, he changed the energy.\nAdvertisement\nA visceral noise re-entered the ground and, with the help of Nwaneri, they scored twice to win 4-2.\nThat ability to change the mood of 60,000 people (and even more who watch on TV) in an instant is rare. Nwaneri\u2019s decisiveness plays a part in that, and cropped up at various points of last season. In his second Premier League start, away to Brighton & Hove Albion, he had Declan Rice in support as he went through on goal but didn\u2019t have a second thought. He was in control and finished the attack.\nBy the time Rice switched the ball to him with Arsenal 4-1 up against Manchester City, Nwaneri knew what he was going to do. He had been calling for the ball for 14 seconds, so quickly pushed it out of his feet and whipped it into the far corner. Once again, the Emirates erupted as he had joined Lewis-Skelly on the scoresheet.\nAfter his first Champions League goal away to Girona, Arteta said: \u201cThat (Nwaneri\u2019s decisiveness) is what we love about him. That he\u2019s willing to take the initiative to make things happen.\u201d\n\ud83c\udfb6 He\u2019s one of our own \ud83c\udfb6\nEvery Ethan Nwaneri goal so far \ud83c\udfaf pic.twitter.com/JQxdUggER9\n\u2014 Arsenal (@Arsenal) April 6, 2025\nThat willingness and ability to \u201cmake things happen\u201d is what any team needs. Nwaneri scored nine goals and assisted two in his breakout season, rivalling scoring records set by Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney before their 18th birthdays despite not being a centre-forward.\nThere has been a shortage of players like that of late. Players who can truly disrupt defences, get people off their seats and remind spectators why they fell in love with the game. And that does not always have to be with goals or assists \u2014 when Nwaneri beats a defender with his quick feet, it is special.\nThere were matches when these aspects of his game made him Arsenal\u2019s biggest attacking threat in Arteta\u2019s eyes \u2014 all while being the youngest player in the squad \u2014 a theme that continued when he was away helping England Under-21s retain the European Championship this summer.\nAdvertisement\nDuring the tournament, head coach Lee Carsley, who played alongside Arteta for Everton in a 1-0 win over Arsenal three days before Nwaneri\u2019s birth, said: \u201cI love watching him play. Players like that really get you excited when they get the ball because you feel something is going to happen.\u201d\nThankfully for Arsenal, that will continue to be the case in north London.\n(Top photo: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Offside via Getty Images)"

      "text": "If anyone needs a reminder of just how dizzyingly \u2014 and, at times, brutally \u2014 fast football moves, consider that less than two weeks ago, Levi Colwill was talking about competing for the Premier League title with Chelsea this season, and how he felt about an impending Champions League debut at his boyhood club.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhen that anthem comes on, it is going to be a dream,\u201d he told The Athletic at a pre-season friendly between Sholing FC and Chelsea Under-18s. \u201cI could get a bit emotional, to be honest.\u201d\nThat particular dream is going to have to wait, and Colwill would only be human if he had got more than a bit emotional in the days since he felt his knee give way towards the end of Chelsea\u2019s first pre-season training session at their Cobham HQ on Monday.\nA scan confirmed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), but footballers tend to know immediately when something is badly wrong. Enzo Maresca\u2019s ominous words in his press conference at Cobham on Thursday left little room to avoid the conclusion that Colwill had suffered a significant injury.\n\u201cWe know each other from last year, and we know how important he has been,\u201d Maresca said. \u201cI spoke with Levi yesterday (Wednesday) and I told him that if we achieved what we achieved last year, it\u2019s also because of him.\u201d\nColwill\u2019s absence from Chelsea\u2019s trophy celebration in front of several thousand supporters at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday provided the first public indication that something was amiss. A club statement issued on Thursday evening attempted to soften the blow while confirming the reality: \u201cLevi Colwill has today undergone successful surgery to an anterior cruciate ligament injury.\u201d\nThere are many sentiments deployed at moments like this, most of them empty. The timing is awful for Colwill before a Chelsea season rich with promise, leading into a World Cup where he could credibly start for England. But then, there is never a good time for a footballer to tear their ACL, given the long and gruelling nature of the rehabilitation process.\nFor some, it will feel worse because Colwill gives every impression of being one of football\u2019s genuine good guys, devoting his time and his money to Sholing and the new academy that bears his name, as well as organising a training session for children while on holiday in Trinidad. But good, bad or anything in between, it is always a sporting tragedy when football is deprived of an elite talent in this manner.\nAdvertisement\nMany will express the belief that Colwill can emerge stronger from this, but that is a reach for reassurance rather than a reliable predictor. Even in 2025, injuries as severe as a torn ACL or ruptured Achilles can disrupt and even derail athletes\u2019 careers. As a Chelsea player, Colwill will have every available resource to achieve a full recovery to elite competition, but there is no escaping the physical and mental challenges that lie ahead.\nPerhaps the most effective source of comfort to Colwill in the coming weeks and months will be the difficulty Chelsea have replacing him.\nLast season, he emerged as the foundation of Maresca\u2019s defence, playing more than twice as many Premier League minutes as any of the other centre-backs in the squad. His recognition of defensive danger sharpened with greater experience, and he warmed to the physical demands of battling opposing strikers. He formed effective partnerships with Wesley Fofana, Tosin Adarabioyo and fellow Cobham graduate Trevoh Chalobah, adjusting subtly to fit with each.\nOn the ball, his ability to punch progressive passes through opposition lines gave Maresca\u2019s patient build-up style a more direct option it desperately needed against low blocks. Colwill\u2019s unflappable assurance was critical to the team\u2019s success in playing out from the back through intense pressure.\nPut together, it is a rare, coveted skill set for a centre-back, which is why Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion tried hard to prise Colwill away from Stamford Bridge in the weeks before he signed a new long-term contract in the summer of 2023. It is also why Chelsea rebuffed all advances and always insisted they considered him untouchable, as he has been ever since.\nThen there is Colwill\u2019s strength of personality, which always stood out in one of the youngest squads ever assembled. No other regular Chelsea starter could be relied upon so consistently to field questions from the media after a match, win, lose or draw, and few others were as loud or outwardly forceful on the pitch.\nAdvertisement\nWithin the squad, there are no easy solutions. Tosin and Chalobah have both grown in stature and performance in this Chelsea squad in recent months, but are untested as a partnership in the Premier League. Benoit Badiashile has not proven as reliable as Colwill despite being regarded as a close to equivalent talent when he arrived from Monaco in January 2023.\nFofana is arguably Chelsea\u2019s most gifted defender, but the 24-year-old has also spent much of his time at Stamford Bridge on the sidelines. Summer signing Jorrel Hato has some similarities to Colwill in profile \u2014 left-footed, elegant on the ball, shorter but faster \u2014 but elevating the 19-year-old to the status of Premier League starting centre-back so soon would be a big call. The same could be said of another 19-year-old, Josh Acheampong, who Maresca has generally preferred to pick at right-back.\nThe transfer market will always be a consideration for Chelsea at a time like this, but any exploration must be tinged with wariness of radically altering the dynamic at the heart of Maresca\u2019s defence for the long term. Until he went down this week, Colwill was a fundamental component of the core that is powering the team\u2019s sharp upward trajectory.\nAny defensive plan that Chelsea decide upon in what remains of August must allow for the desired scenario that Colwill is fundamental again as soon as he returns.\n(Top photo: Alex Grimm/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Welcome to the seventh edition of The Athletic\u2019s Transfer DealSheet for the summer 2025 transfer window.\nOur team of dedicated writers, including David Ornstein, will take you inside the market to explain the deals being worked on. The mini-window ahead of the Club World Cup has come and gone, but the regular summer transfer window is open and will run until September 1.\nAdvertisement\nThe information found within this article has been gathered according to The Athletic\u2019s sourcing guidelines. Unless stated, our reporters have spoken to more than one person briefed on each deal before offering the clubs involved the opportunity to comment. Their responses, when they were given, have been included in the Transfer DealSheet.\nWe aim to bring you analysis you can trust about what is happening at Europe\u2019s leading clubs and the latest information we\u2019re hearing from across the market. This year, The Athletic\u2019s football finance writer, Chris Weatherspoon, will be adding to our analysis of the transfer market.\nLast week, we looked at Lionel Messi\u2019s situation, the arrival of Christian Norgaard at Arsenal and interest in Christopher Nkunku. This week, we have the latest on Liverpool and their transfer situation, and analyse Newcastle\u2019s push for Hugo Ekitike.\nThis article is long but detailed, so enjoy it all \u2014 or search for the club or player you want to read about.\nDavid Ornstein\u2019s One To Watch\nLiverpool returned to action on Sunday in a pre-season friendly at Preston North End. As would have been expected following the tragic death of their forward Diogo Jota, the occasion was dominated by tributes.\nLiverpool were able to hand game time to a number of new arrivals \u2014 Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong featured from the bench \u2014 owing to their early transfer activity. But while sensitivities around the club remain understandably high, there is an awareness they need to make further additions this summer.\nThe Premier League champions have prioritised an elite front three in recent seasons, with two strong options in each position. While on the left (Luiz Diaz and Cody Gakpo) and right (Mohamed Salah and Jeremie Frimpong) they have that available to them, they currently do not have an established first choice in the middle. Federico Chiesa is considered an option there, but Napoli and Al Hilal have been keeping tabs on Darwin Nunez. It is expected that a move for him will progress again soon.\nLiverpool\u2019s stance is that Diaz will not leave, and so unless that changes, their focus when it comes to incomings is on finding a top No 9. Sporting director Richard Hughes is prioritising that at present.\nEarlier in the window, targets to improve a team at Liverpool\u2019s level will have included the likes of Alexander Isak, Hugo Ekitike, Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Joao Pedro, while Nicolas Jackson is also a player Hughes liked when he was with Bournemouth.\nAdvertisement\nIf the Senegal international was not a Chelsea player he might be a more realistic candidate, given the Club World Cup winners have signed Joao Pedro and Liam Delap to operate up front. Isak and Ekitike remain prominent in their thinking but various factors would need to align for such interest to develop.\nWhy do Liverpool need to sign a No 9?\nThere\u2019s still a lot of affection for Darwin Nunez among Liverpool supporters.\nThe Uruguayan frontman made a few vital contributions en route to Arne Slot\u2019s side winning the Premier League title, and always wears his heart on his sleeve.\nHowever, the reality is that a return of just seven goals in 47 appearances in all competitions in 2024-25 was underwhelming. Nunez only started eight Premier League matches, with Slot preferring to play Luis Diaz as a false nine as he felt the Colombian was better suited to his system.\nAfter three mixed seasons at Liverpool, a summer exit for Nunez looked inevitable \u2014 with strong interest from Saudi Arabia and Italian club Napoli. So far, it hasn\u2019t happened with no acceptable offers forthcoming.\nBut if Liverpool can get \u00a360million for Nunez they should cash in and put that money towards an upgrade. Playing Florian Wirtz in an advanced central role in Slot\u2019s 4-2-3-1 is an option, but he\u2019s arguably better operating slightly deeper.\nJames Pearce\nWhat else we\u2019re hearing\n- The gap between Manchester United and Brentford on their valuation of Bryan Mbeumo remains considerable. The two sides are several million pounds apart. There have been no significant developments over the past couple of weeks, and a deal is still not imminent, but talks continue as United work to complete a move for the Cameroon forward. David Ornstein\n- Newcastle United are working on a deal worth around \u20ac75million to sign Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike. While an agreement is not yet close, talks are ongoing between the clubs over a potential deal which would eclipse Newcastle\u2019s previous record transfer \u2013 the \u20ac71.2m they paid Real Sociedad for Aleksander Isak in summer 2022. David Ornstein\n- Brentford made an approach to Ipswich Town on Monday for Omari Hutchinson, although a deal is felt to be unlikely at present. Hutchinson is on holiday after being given extended time off by Ipswich following England\u2019s triumphant Euro Under-21 campaign at the end of June. Brentford see the 21-year-old among a small number of potential replacements for Bryan Mbeumo should he join Manchester United. Hutchinson has a relegation release clause worth \u00a335million, which Brentford fell significantly short of meeting. That expires on Tuesday and so far he remains an Ipswich player. David Ornstein and Simon Johnson\n- RB Leipzig and Stuttgart have both expressed their interest in Chelsea forward Armando Broja. Leipzig are preparing for the departure of Benjamin Sesko and Xavi Simons, while Stuttgart have already rejected approaches from Bayern Munich for Nick Woltemade. Both see Broja as a potential replacement. Chelsea are looking for a permanent sale, while Broja is keen to find a new club. Seb Stafford-Bloor and Simon Johnson\n- RB Leipzig are close to completing the signing of Johan Bakayoko from PSV. Bakayoko had been a target for Bayer Leverkusen and has previously attracted Premier League interest, but the Belgium international has agreed to move to Leipzig, pending an agreement between the two clubs. Seb Stafford-Bloor\n- Neom SC are in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over the signing of Granit Xhaka. The Swiss midfielder has already indicated his willingness to join the Saudi Pro League team, who also signed Alexander Lacazette this summer and are coached by Christophe Gaultier, and negotiations with Bayer Leverkusen are continuing. Seb Stafford-Bloor\n- Everton are closing in on two signings to bolster their academy ranks. 16-year-old central defenders John Dodds and Reuben Gokah, from Hearts and Charlton Athletic respectively, are expected to join the club\u2019s under-18 setup in time for the new season. Patrick Boyland\n- Middlesbrough are exploring a deal to sign Danny Ings as a free agent. It is not agreed yet, but the Championship club are looking into it and talks are ongoing. Ings, 32, left West Ham at the end of last season. Chris Waugh\nHow much of the Club World Cup prize money have clubs already spent?\nThis summer\u2019s Club World Cup had an immediate impact on the transfer market, causing the window to open for 10 days at the beginning of June to enable competing clubs to make moves in anticipation of FIFA\u2019s newest tournament.\nNow, with the tournament successfully consigned to the past, we know how much each club has earned from the $1billion prize money pot.\nEurope had 12 teams competing and, unsurprisingly, they hoovered up much of the dividend. Chelsea led the way with \u00a384.5million ($114.6m) in winnings. UEFA\u2019s sides combined gobbled up, using the current conversion rate, \u00a3463.4m \u2014 or nearly two-thirds of the total pot.\nAdvertisement\nHow that has impacted the transfer market isn\u2019t the easiest thing to say. Prize money isn\u2019t a free meal (clubs had to pay the costs of physically getting to the tournament), and demarcating their earnings from the budget they\u2019d have had without those earnings is impossible. Club budgets are impacted by a whole host of things; assuming their spending is directly linked to the money they\u2019ve brought home from the U.S. would be foolish, to say the least.\nStill, we can at least compare competing clubs\u2019 transfer activity to date with their Club World Cup earnings. Of those 12 European clubs, eight have already spent more than their prize money on new transfers this summer. Change the parameters to being on a net basis, and the figure is still seven. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s sale of Jamie Gittens, to Chelsea, no less, means their net transfer spend is now negative.\nJust as they earned the most money this summer, so have Chelsea spent the most. That\u2019s hardly out of keeping for them recently. But Chelsea have seen little reason to taper down. Their estimated \u00a3212m transfer spend so far is more than double what they earned in the U.S., a marker both Manchester City and Porto have also hit.\nAt the other end of the scale, only two clubs have spent less than half their earnings on new signings. Those go by the name of Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain, who\u2019ve yet to be active at all in the transfer market. Don\u2019t expect that to stay the case for too long.\nEven on a net basis, the 12 European clubs have already spent more than their collective Club World Cup earnings on transfers.\nChris Weatherspoon\nArsenal\nIs Gyokeres close to getting over the line?\nArsenal are on the verge of finally landing a No 9. A deal in principle is in place with Sporting Lisbon: Arsenal will pay a fixed fee of \u20ac63.5million (\u00a354.8m, $74.2m) plus \u20ac10m (\u00a38.6m, $11.7m) in potential add-ons for Viktor Gyokeres. Mikel Arteta was eager to sign a centre-forward in time for them to participate in the bulk of Arsenal\u2019s pre-season preparations, and that now appears feasible.\nArsenal hope to close the deal in time for Gyokeres to join them when they depart for Singapore on Saturday.\nWhat else has happened this week?\nIt\u2019s been a frenetic week on the transfer front. Arsenal have also agreed a deal to sign Noni Madueke from Chelsea. Arsenal will pay an initial fee of \u00a348.5million ($65.5m), with a possible \u00a33.5m in potential add-ons. Madueke is expected to sign before Arsenal depart for Asia, but after his participation in the FIFA Club World Cup he may not join up with the squad until they return.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal are also working to complete the signing of Valencia centre-back Cristhian Mosquera. Personal terms with the 21-year-old are already in place, and the two clubs are close to an agreement. Mosquera, a right-footed centre-half who has played on either side of the central defensive axis, will add competition and cover for the first-choice pair of Gabriel and William Saliba.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nIf Arsenal can add Gyokeres, Madueke and Mosquera to the signings of Martin Zubimendi, Kepa, and Norgaard, they will have attended to many of their positional needs.\nThey are not yet closed for business, however. Arsenal are still considering bringing in an additional attacking player. Their interest in the likes of Rodrygo and Eberechi Eze remains, but may not develop until later in the window \u2014 and could potentially be offset by securing some sales.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nArsenal are open to offers for the quartet of senior players who spent last season out on loan: Karl Hein, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Fabio Vieira and Reiss Nelson. Beyond that, Oleksandr Zinchenko may move on, with Myles Lewis-Skelly and Riccardo Calafiori both seemingly ahead of him in the pecking order at left-back. There are no concrete developments yet on a possible departure for Jakub Kiwior, who showed at the tail end of last season that he can be an able deputy for Gabriel.\nThere is a certain degree of intrigue around the left-sided pair of Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard. Arteta values both players, but if a sale could unlock a deal for one of Arsenal\u2019s remaining targets, that could change things. As yet, there are no significant developments \u2014 Martinelli is one of several names Bayern Munich are considering for their left-wing role, but it has not yet developed any further than that.\nA number of young players have been training with the first team in La Manga. Some of these youngsters, such as 19-year-old centre-half Maldini Kacurri, could be ready for a loan or permanent move before the end of the transfer window.\nJames McNicholas\nChelsea\nHas anything happened over the past week?\nChelsea started to get busy on the outgoings front. The most significant news was agreeing a fee worth \u00a352million for Noni Madueke to go to Arsenal. The winger returned from America before the Club World Cup final in order to undergo a medical. A switch should be completed this week.\nGoalkeeper Djordje Petrovic is also set to finalise his move to Bournemouth. As The Athletic has previously reported in the Transfer DealSheet, a gentleman\u2019s agreement was in place between Chelsea and the player for him to be sold for \u00a325m. Bournemouth met the asking price.\nAdvertisement\nMidfielder Mathis Amougou also left for Strasbourg for an undisclosed fee. The 19-year-old only joined Chelsea from Saint-Etienne for \u00a312.5m in February and made just two substitute appearances for the club. Zak Sturge, an under-21 player, has joined Millwall on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee.\nHas Chelsea\u2019s budget changed because of their Club World Cup campaign?\nClearly picking up a neat \u00a384.5m from winning the tournament is a nice figure to put on the balance sheet \u2014 although that amount will be taxed. That sum alone has paid for two of the three summer signings in Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens.\nThe sales listed above (plus Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s \u00a35m transfer to Arsenal) mean they are actually on the cusp of making a profit so far this summer, even though they spent another \u00a350m-plus on Joao Pedro and have been fined \u20ac31m by UEFA for breaching their financial rules.\nIt means Chelsea are in a good financial position to add to their squad, but any additions will depend on departures, which is the priority for the time being.\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\nWith Madueke leaving for Arsenal, Chelsea are open to the idea of adding another wide player/attacker to the ranks. They have held an interest in Alejandro Garnacho since January, and Manchester United are looking to sell the 21-year-old this summer.\nAs my colleague Conor O\u2019Neill points out: \u201cGarnacho ranked fourth in the Premier League for progressive carries per 90 (9.19), just behind Madueke in third (9.9), underlining his potential to fill the ball-carrying void Madueke leaves behind at Chelsea.\u201d\nAston Villa\u2019s Morgan Rogers is another creative player they admire.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nSeveral fringe squad members who are up for sale began pre-season training at Cobham last week while the first team were still away in the USA.\nAs The Athletic reported, it was made up of players who were loaned out by the club last season. It included Joao Felix, Ben Chilwell, Axel Disasi, Lesley Ugochukwu, Renato Veiga, Armando Broja and Alfie Gilchrist. Chelsea are looking for permanent sales rather than loans.\nAdvertisement\nRaheem Sterling is also no longer wanted at Stamford Bridge, while Bayern Munich are interested in Christopher Nkunku as well as Veiga.\nBorussia Dortmund are keen to re-sign Carney Chukwuemeka on loan with an option to buy, but Chelsea prefer a straight sale.\nStriker Nicolas Jackson is not deemed an \u2018untouchable\u2019 by the club. He could be sold if they receive a high enough offer.\nChelsea under-21 defender Ishe Samuels-Smith has held talks with Strasbourg. Chelsea are looking to sell him for \u00a38m. Midfielder Kendry Paez, defender Aaron Anselmino, and goalkeeper Mike Penders are all being earmarked for a loan to the Ligue 1 side in 2025-26.\nSimon Johnson\nManchester City\nHas anything happened over the past week?\nCity\u2019s players are enjoying a four-week break following their exit from the Club World Cup.\nAfter Kyle Walker\u2019s exit to Burnley, the focus has switched to James McAtee, who is attracting interest from England and Germany.\nThe 22-year-old is available on a permanent transfer, having been allowed to play for England at the Under-21 European Championship rather than be part of the City first-team squad at the Club World Cup. German side Eintracht Frankfurt are keen on the midfielder and have followed him since at least January.\nNottingham Forest also like him and see him as being capable of playing No 8 or No 10. While he is a different player from Morgan Gibbs-White, who could potentially join Spurs, he would add to their creativity at a time when they might need it.\nSome interested clubs believe City could come to the table at \u00a325million but City are acutely aware of the case of Cole Palmer. He was sold to Chelsea in 2023 for a fee a \u00a340m and has gone on to prove that fee was a bargain.\nMcAtee has also played more Premier League minutes at this stage and also has a full season of experience with Sheffield United, so City are keen to secure a fee they view as comparable with his profile.\nThe price could also vary depending on how close a competitor they are with City. However, no official bids have been received by City yet.\nWhat does Ilkay Gundogan\u2019s future look like?\nThe former Germany international wants to stay at the top level, provided he still has a promising role to play.\nGalatasaray are the club he supported growing up, and they remain interested should his position change.\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\nA recognised right-back still appears to be the only gap in the squad, but so far, there appears to be little progress on that front.\nRico Lewis and Matheus Nunes can both play there, but neither has truly cemented the position as their own yet.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nThe numbers still aren\u2019t adding up for Guardiola\u2019s wish for a smaller squad.\nIt means that players such as John Stones, Nico O\u2019Reilly, Mateo Kovacic, Gundogan, Claudio Echeverri and Oscar Bobb, even if they have stated they wish to stay, have all been touted as potential exits either on loan or permanently.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, it is understood that Bobb, who impressed last pre-season but missed the entire season through injury, is very unlikely to be leaving the Etihad this summer.\nJordan Campbell\nManchester United\nHas anything happened over the past week?\nAndre Onana suffered a hamstring injury that will rule him out of United\u2019s pre-season tour of the U.S. and puts him in a race against time to be fit for Arsenal\u2019s visit to Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the Premier League campaign. This might impact United\u2019s plans on the goalkeeper market.\nThe club told the five players actively up for sale to only report for training this week after 5pm, once Ruben Amorim and the rest of the first-team squad have already left Carrington. Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are all looking to secure moves away.\nUnited held talks with two 16-year-old midfielders regarded as among the best in the country in Fulham\u2019s Seth Ridgeon and Manchester City\u2019s Tyrese Noubissie. Both are able to move before signing scholar contracts and United have made proposals, but face competition.\nBryan Mbeumo reported for duty at Brentford\u2019s training ground on Monday, as Keith Andrews\u2019 squad returned from their summer breaks.\nAre all of the out-of-favour five willing to leave?\nThat\u2019s the idea, albeit easier said than done when some of their wages are big, buyers know United need to sell, and there is not, as yet, great competition for their signatures.\nOne element that has relevance is Rashford and Garnacho, in particular, wanting to play in the World Cup next year, and so they have extra motivation to find a suitable destination for the coming season. As well as United looking to negotiate solutions, there is impetus for the players and their agents to work on exits.\nRashford is frequently posting footage of himself keeping fit in the gym, and Barcelona\u2019s interest is concrete. In January, Garnacho initially wanted to stay at United, but if he is to go, he has expressed a preference for staying in the Premier League, ideally in the Champions League, and Chelsea, who are looking at him, fit the bill.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\nAll focus is on Mbeumo, with United and Brentford in a stand-off over price. More than a fortnight has passed since United\u2019s second bid of \u00a355m plus \u00a37.5m in add-ons was rejected by Brentford, who originally wanted more than the \u00a362.5m Wolves received for Matheus Cunha. While there is some debate over the exact fee Brentford want, the reported \u00a370m offer by Tottenham, later denied by the club, is seen by some as a yardstick.\nUnited are being patient in the hope that Brentford ease on their valuation, given Mbeumo has said he wants to move to Old Trafford. Mbeumo\u2019s mood at Brentford training has now become a potential factor in the negotiations. He reported to Brentford\u2019s training ground on Monday and the club are relaxed about their position.\nIn terms of goalkeepers, Botafogo\u2019s John Victor has been scouted in case Altay Bayindir leaves, while there were talks on Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but United could only afford his fee if Onana is sold.\nUnited sent a scout to watch defender Eivind Helland, captain of Norway\u2019s under-21s, play for Brann against Viking on Sunday. The 20-year-old, who has 37 senior appearances for the club, can play centre-back and right-back and would cost around \u20ac7million to \u20ac8m. He played well as Brann won the game 3-1.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAside from the exiled five, there has been speculation around Rasmus Hojlund. But Inter no longer hold an active interest in buying him after they signed 21-year-old Ange-Yoan Bonny, who scored six goals in Serie A for Parma last season.\nLaurie Whitwell\nNewcastle United\nHas anything happened over the past week?\nAfter weeks of disappointment and knockbacks \u2014 including with Bryan Mbeumo, Dean Huijsen and Joao Pedro \u2014 Newcastle welcomed their first senior signing of the summer on Friday. Anthony Elanga, the winger, joined from Nottingham Forest on a five-year deal, for an initial fee of \u00a352m.\nNot only did that bring about much relief inside St James\u2019 Park, given Eddie Howe had publicly pleaded for Newcastle to act swiftly and early in the market, the hope inside the club is that it also generated positive momentum.\nAdvertisement\nCallum Wilson, the 33-year-old striker, has confirmed his departure and Newcastle are looking at a range of potential striker targets, with Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Hugo Ekitike \u2014 who they twice tried to sign previously in 2022 \u2014 the most ambitious of them and the top target.\nTalks have intensified in recent days, with Newcastle working on a deal worth around around \u20ac75million (\u00a365.2m; $87.5m). No agreement is in place, but negotiations are continuing with Frankfurt over a potential club-record acquisition.\nThe first-team squad returned for pre-season training last week and several senior players were involved in a 4-0 behind-closed-doors friendly victory over Carlisle United on Tyneside on Saturday. Joelinton, who missed the last five games of last season with a knee injury, received a 45-minute runout.\nHowe and his squad flew to Austria on Monday for a five-day training camp ahead of their opening official pre-season friendly at Celtic this Saturday.\nNewcastle may continue to operate without a sporting director following Paul Mitchell\u2019s exit at the end of June, but senior members of the recruitment team have travelled with the squad to Seefeld as the club looks for another transfer breakthrough.\nNewcastle are negotiating for Ekitike (Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\nWhat is the priority now Elanga has joined?\nEkitike is not concluded yet, so in basic terms, another signing to significantly bolster Howe\u2019s squad, preferably before Newcastle travel to Singapore and South Korea next week.\nA centre-back and a goalkeeper are still wanted, but acquiring a striker or versatile forward to replace Wilson is a pressing need. That is partly why Newcastle are pushing hard for progress with Ekitike, but also because they realise that speed is of the essence to conclude a deal before rival suitors potentially swoop in.\nAdvertisement\nEkitike\u2019s versatility \u2014 he is able to play across the frontline and has many stylistic similarities with Joao Pedro, though arguably has a higher ceiling potential-wise \u2014 is attractive.\nHe also scored 15 goals and provided eight assists in the Bundesliga last season and would be viewed as a marquee addition.\nBrentford\u2019s Yoane Wissa was floated as a potential striker option to Newcastle, too, but as things stand they are not expected to make a move for the 28-year-old.\nDespite Newcastle operating without a sporting director and claims that is limiting their recruitment team to focusing upon one deal at a time, sources insist they are actively discussing moves for multiple transfer targets across several positions.\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\nGoalkeeper, centre-back, and a forward to replace Wilson are the priority positions.\nBeyond the principal targets mentioned above, centre-backs based in the Premier League and across Europe have been discussed during recruitment meetings. Newcastle remain interested in Marc Guehi, the Crystal Palace and England defender who is in the final year of his contract, having failed in a month-long pursuit last August. Atalanta\u2019s Giorgio Scalvini is also admired, with the club aware of the likely costs of any deal. No bid has been launched or discussions initiated with Atalanta for the Italy international, but he has been closely tracked. Marseille\u2019s Leonardo Balerdi is another on Newcastle\u2019s defender list, but no move has been made for the 26-year-old Argentina international.\nChelsea\u2019s Axel Disasi is not under consideration as things stand, despite reports to the contrary.\nUp front, Newcastle have an interest in free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin, having previously not held one, after the Joao Pedro situation changed things. This does not mean that Newcastle will move for him, but the former Everton man has featured in conversations, having previously not been on their list of targets.\nAdvertisement\nStrikers and versatile forwards of various profiles, ages and price ranges have entered the mix in recent weeks, with Calvert-Lewin featuring on the opposite end of the spectrum as a free agent with Premier League experience, to someone like Ekitike, who is seen as an ambitious target with elite-level potential. If a deal for Ekitike is concluded, however, then Calvert-Lewin is highly unlikely to join as well.\nBurnley\u2019s James Trafford remains their primary goalkeeper target, but their long-term pursuit of the 22-year-old has continued for another week without a decisive breakthrough.\nNewcastle are not looking to sign Jack Grealish, even though they are continually linked with the Manchester City winger.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nOdysseas Vlachodimos is available, most likely for a loan given the PSR ramifications of selling the Greece international who Newcastle paid \u00a320million for, and Real Betis are among the clubs interested in the 31-year-old. Club-to-club contact has not yet been made, and Betis are believed to be exploring other options, too, but Newcastle would likely need to cover a significant portion of Vlachodimos\u2019 wages, should he be loaned out.\nMartin Dubravka is also likely to depart should another goalkeeper sign. However, John Ruddy, the 38-year-old, is due to stay for 2025-26, having played against Carlisle on Saturday, despite Newcastle having yet to publicly confirm his extension after his previous deal expired on June 30.\nNewcastle have no need or appetite to sell their best players and would not welcome bids for the likes of Isak, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimaraes or Anthony Gordon. They will also rebuff any interest in Tino Livramento, who is repeatedly linked with Manchester City.\nMatt Targett is available, and Newcastle would listen to offers for Sean Longstaff, who is entering the final year of his contract. The latter has attracted interest and offers from promoted Leeds United, among other Premier League clubs, but they are yet to reach Newcastle\u2019s asking price.\nAdvertisement\nJoe Willock has two years left on his contract and has been linked with moves elsewhere. Isaac Hayden, whose current deal expires next summer, is also available.\nChris Waugh\nEkitike and Newcastle \u2014 the key questions answered\nHasn\u2019t Ekitike rejected them twice before?\nYes. In January and the summer of 2022, the first two windows post-takeover.\nEkitike was still a relative unknown, but had broken through and impressed for Reims, his hometown club, and Newcastle tried to bring him to Tyneside to aid with their relegation fight in January, given goals were in short supply. A deal went down to the final hours of the window, but could not be concluded.\nNewcastle\u2019s interest did not wane, however, and they returned a few months later. Initially confident that a transfer had all but been agreed, Paris Saint-Germain swooped in and Ekitike opted to head to the French capital, rather than to Tyneside.\nThat was a blow and, in the minds of some Newcastle fans, Ekitike\u2019s decision left a sour taste. Such negative feelings will quickly dissipate should he sign and perform well for their club, however.\nInterestingly, Newcastle\u2019s recruitment department have tracked Ekitike\u2019s development closely over the past three years and, while Joao Pedro was initially their main forward target this summer, they have switched to a potential marquee addition \u2014 one which had appeared beyond them financially earlier in the summer \u2014 having missed out on the Brazilian.\nChris Waugh\nWhat does this mean for Isak if he joins?\nThe obvious fear that Newcastle fans will have \u2014 and the obvious leap that supporters of other clubs who desperately want to sign Isak will make \u2014 is that Ekitike arriving signals an exit for the Sweden international.\nMultiple sources at Newcastle insist that is not the case. They claim that the plan is to play Isak and Ekitike together, or to switch between the two, to ensure Newcastle have the goalscoring depth to compete on multiple fronts next season, given they are back in the Champions League.\nAdvertisement\nThe sceptics will suggest this is Newcastle acquiring Isak\u2019s replacement before he has left, but Newcastle have been adamant, publicly and privately, for months that the 25-year-old is going nowhere. The hope is that they tie him down to a new deal but, even if they cannot do so, his contract runs until 2028, and the directive from the very top of the club is that they keep hold of Isak.\nHow Newcastle could sustain two forwards of such pedigree \u2014 even if both can also play out wide \u2014 is unclear, from a PSR or footballing perspective. Newcastle have also insisted throughout the window that Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes will not be sold, either, while the club has just signed Elanga.\nThis prospective deal presents more questions than answers in many ways, but that should not diminish the ambition being shown. Ekitike would be a signing who, like Isak and Sandro Tonali before him, grabs the attention of the whole of Europe.\nChris Waugh\nCan Ekitike and Isak play together?\nHugo Ekitike can play, that much is clear from his highlight reel. But can he play with Aleksander Isak?\nIf Newcastle are successful in their pursuit, that would be the plan \u2014 and there\u2019s every reason to believe that it could be a successful combination. Because of how well Ekitike combined with Omar Marmoush, before the Egyptian was sold to Manchester City, and because there is a facilitating aspect to Ekitike\u2019s game that it\u2019s easy to imagine someone like Isak profiting from.\nLast season, according to data from FBref.com, Ekitike was in the 95th percentile for key passes (1.60/90 minutes), the 94th percentile for shot-creating actions (3.50/90 minutes), and the 93rd among all forwards for Expected Assists (0.19/90 minutes).\nThat performance can be attributed partly to how much defensive attention Ekitike attracts and how easily he can go beyond defenders and into space. He had a high shot volume last year, too (3.74/90 minutes) and that was a contributing factor also. But he plays with great craft too, and with a vision and touch that is rare.\nAdvertisement\nHis influence remains intermittent, and at 23, with fewer than 150 top-flight appearances to his name in senior football, he is still a developing player with many areas to improve in.\nFrankfurt are a transition team that rarely face a deep block. He must learn how to cope with that. His chance conversion must also be more efficient, and he will need to become fiercer without the ball. If he is to fully realise his potential, then he will have to gain all the necessary experience and, ultimately, be as well-coached as he has been in Frankfurt by Dino Topmoller.\nIs that Eddie Howe? Perhaps. Newcastle still have to reach an agreement for Ekitike. But whichever team does strike that deal will be getting a mighty prospect.\nSeb Stafford-Bloor\nCan Newcastle afford Ekitike without player sales?\nFrom a financial perspective, Premier League clubs have two real limitations on spending: regulations and cash. The former restraint has gained prominence in recent years as profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) have bitten; the latter has been an issue since transfers began.\nFor Newcastle, cash troubles disappeared into thin air in early October 2021. Taken over by one of the wealthiest sovereign wealth funds on the planet, there was little fear of the club\u2019s liquidity running dry. Even if there were delays in transporting money from Saudi Arabia, Newcastle have a term loan in place with HSBC (recently renewed) and a revolving credit facility to aid any cash flow needs.\nIf cash hasn\u2019t been an issue on Tyneside recently then regulation certainly has. June 2024 saw Newcastle frantically scurrying to sell players to avoid a PSR breach some estimate would have been in the \u00a350million region.\nTime heals many ills, and so too where PSR is concerned. 2025-26 sees the second of Newcastle\u2019s consecutive \u00a370m-plus pre-tax losses fall out of their PSR calculation, significantly improving regulatory headroom. Newcastle lost just \u00a311m in 2023-24 and while we don\u2019t yet know last season\u2019s result, it\u2019s clear they have scope to spend this summer.\nAdvertisement\nTo that end, dropping a club record fee on Ekitike won\u2019t need to be offset by player sales. Ekitike\u2019s fee and wages would add to the club\u2019s annual costs but would also arrive in a year where Newcastle are part of a Champions League offering greater financial reward than two years ago, and where commercial growth continues apace.\nChris Weatherspoon\nTottenham Hotspur\nHas anything happened over the past week?\nIt has been one of the most eventful weeks of Spurs transfer business for years. On Tuesday, they confirmed the arrival of Kota Takai, the young Japanese centre-back from Kawasaki Frontale. On Wednesday, they reached an agreement with West Ham United for Mohammed Kudus, landing on a fee of around \u00a355million ($73.8m) for the Ghana winger. His arrival was announced on Thursday, and he started training with his new team-mates on Friday.\nThen Spurs\u2019 attention turned to Nottingham Forest\u2019s England international Morgan Gibbs-White. Things moved quickly as Spurs offered \u00a360million ($80.5m), matching the release clause in Gibbs-White\u2019s contract. The move has been held up over the weekend, with Forest engaging their legal team, and Gibbs-White attended Forest training on Monday.\nDo they still need more attacking players?\nKudus ticked an important box. Spurs have struggled with a lack of quick wingers who can beat defenders one against one. They signed Wilson Odobert from Burnley last summer, but he struggled with hamstring injuries and only started to make an impact towards the end of the season.\nKudus is Premier League-proven and will instantly elevate Spurs\u2019 attack. The fact that Spurs then turned their attention to Gibbs-White shows they still want more attacking quality in the final third, even though they already have James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski.\nDominic Solanke could do with back-up at No 9, although it remains to be seen whether Richarlison and Son Heung-min will be there at the start of the season.\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\nDo they need an upgrade in the middle of the pitch? Spurs had to make do with Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur in the No 6 role last season, neither of whom had stellar seasons, although they both contributed well to winning the Europa League at the end of the season.\nAdvertisement\nMany Spurs fans have been saying for years they need a high-quality No 6 so it remains to be seen what Thomas Frank\u2019s plans are in that area. Maybe that will be the role earmarked for Archie Gray, who had a few games there last season without ever looking comfortable. The one other area that could do with strengthening is left-back. Tottenham have explored the possibility of adding another full-back this window.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAtletico Madrid have decided to move on from their pursuit of Cristian Romero and look elsewhere for centre-backs. The belief at Atletico is that Spurs will now try to tie Romero to a new contract, which would be the obvious thing to do for such a good player now with two years left on his Tottenham contract.\nThe next most intriguing question concerns the future of Spurs captain Son. This will be the final year of his contract, and it might be that he decides that lifting the Europa League in May marks the right moment for him to bow out, although he will surely be on the pre-season tour to South Korea. There are question marks over a few other senior players \u2014 Richarlison and Bissouma especially \u2014 but no recent developments on exits. Most players only met Frank for the first time last week.\nJack Pitt-Brooke\nBarcelona\nHas anything happened over the past week?\nBarcelona\u2019s first-team players have returned to training this week. They will train in Barcelona for 10 days before they fly to their pre-season tour in Japan and South Korea.\nHansi Flick has already taken care of the most urgent task on his to-do list: having a face-to-face chat with Marc-Andre ter Stegen. After the signing of Espanyol\u2019s goalkeeper Joan Garcia, Flick told the German last Friday that he plans to start the season with Garcia as his number one choice in goal.\nBarcelona sources say they won\u2019t actively look for a club to move Ter Stegen to. It is on the 33-year-old to decide what to do next, and those close to the player say he is willing to take on the challenge to fight for his place \u2014 despite the prospect that not playing for a whole season would put at risk his participation in the World Cup next summer as Germany\u2019s starting goalkeeper. The summer is long, and this will be a situation to keep an eye on.\nAdvertisement\nAlongside all the Barcelona first-team players who resumed training, Roony Bardghji was there too. The 19-year-old was pictured in a Barcelona kit one day before his signing was officially announced. Roony will complete pre-season under Flick\u2019s orders.\nLast Sunday was not just an important date given Barca\u2019s return to training \u2013 it was also Lamine Yamal\u2019s 18th birthday. This is expected to be a big week for the teenager, with expectation that his taking over of the No 10 shirt will be announced on Wednesday.\nPablo Torre finally confirmed his move to Mallorca on Monday night for \u20ac5million. Barcelona sources say they have a buy-back clause and percentage sell-on of future profit.\nWill UEFA\u2019s fine hurt Barcelona\u2019s transfer capabilities?\nIt won\u2019t help, that\u2019s for sure.\nBarcelona were fined \u20ac15m by UEFA after failing to meet their Financial Fair Play rules last season. Club sources say this fine was inevitable because UEFA and La Liga have different criteria for assessing annual budgets. Money coming from the sale of future assets, such as TV rights for the forthcoming seasons, can\u2019t be counted as income according to UEFA. La Liga allows it, and it has been used by Barcelona as a way to meet the division\u2019s salary limit regulations.\nNow that \u20ac15m fine will have to be accounted for as a loss. It was not a problem to pay it, as Barcelona say they had the money at their disposal. But it will become an extra hurdle when it comes to registering new signings \u2014 Barcelona will have to recoup more money in order to be in a stable position with La Liga.\nNumbers from all La Liga clubs regarding their salary cap are not officially disclosed until the end of the transfer window.\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\nThe main focus remains the left-winger role.\nThe two biggest names Barcelona have at the top of their list are the ones we mentioned last week: Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford.\nAdvertisement\nAs days go by, there has been a realisation around the club that despite Diaz still being the preferred option for Deco, it is going to be a very difficult deal to complete. Barcelona fear the demands Liverpool will have to allow the 28-year-old to leave are going to price them out.\nThat\u2019s what keeps the Rashford option very open. Barcelona know the player is very keen to join the club, and Manchester United are very willing to offload him. As much as Flick would appreciate having all his players available as soon as possible in pre-season, the more this saga drags on, the better it will be for the financial aspect at Barcelona. Club sources indicate they will know more precisely the margin they really have to register new signings.\nBarcelona have other names on the backburner \u2014 all of them for now are behind Diaz and Rashford among the club\u2019s preferences, according to club sources.\nThe Catalans have asked about Christopher Nkunku\u2019s availability this summer. They see him as an option if they\u2019re unable to conclude a deal for either of their two top candidates.\nHowever, while the player is keen on a move, Chelsea are not open to anything other than a permanent sale at this stage of the window.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAmong the footballers that joined pre-season, Ter Stegen and Pau Victor as two names that Barcelona would be open to selling. While the German goalkeeper\u2019s camp says he is willing to stay and fight for his place, Victor is open to a switch of clubs in order to find regular gametime.\nTer Stegen did not train in the first session of pre-season, Barcelona have confirmed, although they did not say whether he was injured or not.\nPol Ballus\nDo Diaz, Rashford or Nkunku suit Barcelona more?\nDiaz remains the top choice for Barcelona\u2019s sporting director Deco. His versatility \u2014 equally happy playing through the middle and drifting into midfield as he is out wide \u2014 as well as his sharpening instincts in front of goal, means he would fit seamlessly into Barcelona\u2019s front three, interchanging with the dangerous Raphinha off the left.\nAdvertisement\nRashford can play both roles too, recently outlining his increasing comfort in the No 9 position after an encouraging loan spell at Aston Villa. While he is less likely drop deep and interact with midfielders, he would bring those flickers of individualism through his direct dribbling and ability to strike the ball from distance that can help Barcelona to break down stubborn low blocks.\nNkunku, on the other hand, is more of a poacher, a player who can start off the left, but is ultimately at his most dangerous when he can attack the space in the box.\nThom Harris\nReal Madrid\nHas anything happened over the past week?\nAfter Real Madrid were eliminated in the Club World Cup semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain, the transfer market is back in the spotlight.\nAn agreement has finally been reached to sign Benfica\u2019s Alvaro Carreras (pending verification of the length of contract) and to pay the \u20ac50million (\u00a343.5m/$58.4m) fee in instalments.\nAfter an intense two-month saga, the 22-year-old left-back \u2014 who trained in Madrid\u2019s youth academy before moving to Manchester United in 2020 \u2014 will be presented on Tuesday at the Valdebebas sports complex.\nThe departures of legends Luka Modric to Milan and Lucas Vazquez \u2014 who has several options open to him, including a move to Europe \u2014 have also been confirmed. They will bid farewell to Madrid at an event expected to take place this week.\nMore departures of young players are expected, but the first to be officially confirmed is that of winger Victor Munoz, who has signed for Osasuna for \u20ac6million for 50 per cent of his rights.\nWill not reaching the Club World Cup final change Madrid\u2019s plans?\nAfter losing to Barcelona in the most recent La Liga Clasico, the message from Madrid was that a new era was beginning under Xabi Alonso and that three signings would be made: a right-back, a central defender and a left-back.\nThe club has signed Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen and Carreras, so those first signings considered to be a priority have been completed. But that is not to say this is the end of Madrid\u2019s transfer window.\nXabi Alonso is expected to ask for more reinforcements. He said in a press conference after the match against PSG: \u201cDuring the World Cup, we have not talked about the composition of the squad, but we always have the idea of improving. There is room for improvement.\u201d\nThere are also expected to be departures. The Athletic have reported that Brazilian forward Rodrygo is for sale, while the backline could be strengthened should a central defender leave.\nAdvertisement\nBut at the moment, there are no indications that anyone from the first team is leaving, except for the Castilla player Jacobo Ramon, who is of interest to Como.\nIn addition, there are signings that depend more on the moment or the opportunity, as was the case with Franco Mastantuono.\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\nAt this point, there are no definite targets, pending further club meetings.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nApart from Rodrygo, there are many young Madrid players who could leave in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen what decision is taken with Fran Garcia. Although his first idea is to stay and compete with Carreras for a place at left-back, he has interest from several clubs after doing well at the Club World Cup.\nTwo other players who could leave are midfielders Chema and Mario Martin. Both have many suitors from the Primera Division. In the case of Chema, Levante is one to consider.\nAnother player to follow in the coming weeks will be Dani Ceballos. The 28-year-old, who began his career at Betis, has left the door open to leave Madrid. He admitted when speaking to local media in Seville that he had not spoken to Betis but that he was open to everything.\nGuillermo Rai\n(Top image: Designed by Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; photographs by Harry Langer/DeFodi, Catherine Ivill/AMA via Getty Images)"
