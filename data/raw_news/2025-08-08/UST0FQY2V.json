  "description": "Spirit Island review: Is it still worth playing in 2025?",
  "content": "Spirit island raises a raging middle finger to colonization, rather than celebrating it like many euro-style war games. Its unique approach to the genre sets it apart from other strategy games. This game's customizable difficulty levels make it approachable despite the initial learning curve, while it also affords plenty of playstyles and heaps of replayability.\n\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.\n\nSpirit Island is a cooperative fantasy wargame in which players take one the role of supernatural beings \u2013 spirits of nature \u2013 who seek to reclaim the land from would-be invaders, and strike fear into the hearts of all those who oppose your might. It's a concept that will appeal to fans of eldritch horror and nature lovers alike, but with deep and intense strategy it'll take no small amount of brain power to push back against your foes. Fans of the best board games, roll up; this is a worthy challenge.\n\nWhile the ethereal artwork nods in a gentler direction, Spirit Island is a brutal board game. One that will have the tactically-minded scratching their heads, and coming back again and again to test out new spirits, strategies, and map layouts. The game puts some incredible twists on area control mechanics, nodding to big names like Risk and many other popular titles, while remaining unique and in its approach to war gaming.\n\u2022 Affords every playstyle under the sun\n\nAfter choosing your starter island and forming your island board, picking a Spirit is the first real step to your Island's inevitable demise. Your inclination toward a certain stat spread (Summary of Powers) governs your initial playstyle, though that may evolve to become more offensive, or take on more of a support role as you build out your deck and try to plug the holes in the table's tactics and overall strategy.\n\nDespite being a medium to high complexity board game, you don't have to jump in the deep end with Spirit Island. The step-by-step tutorial encourages new players to pick from a number of low complexity Spirits to ease them in. Along with a few system simplifications, it's great for ushering an all-new player group into the system, and should you feel confident you can up the complexity of your game individually, without confusing the entire pantheon. The rulebook breaks everything down into contained phases with clear reference cards for everything, too, so it only takes a short(ish) game to learn. That's when the real cerebral work begins.\n\nThe core loop involves building up your presence on the board, playing an evolving hand of Power cards, and expelling invaders before they can build up and ravage the land. Players must also contest against the blight the Invaders leave behind, which when the land is damaged can cascade, removing Spirit presence.\n\nEach card played comes at a printed cost along with a host of associated elements. When stacked up just right, these elements let you activate your Spirit's innate powers, so building a deck that leans into your elemental prowess is recommended. Some powers are activated swiftly in the Spirit Phase, meaning you can get in early before the enemy has a chance to build up forces, while other moves play out later in the round. It ups the tactical chatter, since timing can be everything.\n\nAs the game goes on, Spirits might pick up powers that allow them to use the blight to their advantage, while others might be able to move the otherwise passive native forces into new positions for greater defense. Some might learn to convert enemy units, buff allies, or eliminate entire settlements in one fell swoop. There's a playstyle for everyone here, and plenty of potential to branch out.\n\u2022 Fun concept with a lot of potential for emergent narrative to surface\n\u2022 Games can be slow, but are great for forming a deep strategy over multiple sessions\n\u2022 Brutal, but with impeccable pacing as your power level increases\n\nSpirit Island is a fantastic concept \u2013 one that allows for heaps of emergent narratives and deep, succulent strategies to form over multiple games. The custom difficulty options give players plenty of leeway, though even an 'easy' game is pretty brutal by wargame standards. Since enemy growth is almost perfectly synchronised with your own, matching your steps beat-for-beat unless players are able to coordinate impeccably, the game can feel supremely futile at points.\n\nIt's a beautifully dubious dance of destruction, marked by inspired methods of balancing on each side. To give players half a chance against ever more proficient enemy forces, most rounds will see them increasing the number of playable cards and per-round energy they generate. Accumulating Fear tokens is a way to collectively stem the tide, as it increases the Terror Level, ultimately reducing the difficulty of the win-state. It never really feels like you have the upper hand until late game, but being aware of your growing power and lowering win-state makes the constant tension far more palatable in earlier stages.\n\nThe draw-four-pick-one mechanic for gaining powers provides enough control in building out your deck, and as long as you have presence within range, there's always a choice as to where you might target next. Alongside some foresight as to where the enemy will build and strike next, there's enough player agency to inspire confidence that RNGsus won't swing the game too wildly and ruin it for everyone.\n\nSince every choice matters, the constant pressure can stretch a single game across multiple sessions of several hours a piece. The more players, the longer the tactical backtracking to find the most optimal play. Let's be real, you're going to need a long attention span to enjoy Spirit Island. I'd also recommend separate gaming and dining tables.\n\nIf you're hankering for a tactical challenge, one that will test friendships and neural pathways equally, Spirit Island will deliver a highly customisable test of wits and cooperative skill. While it can feel like a slog, the constant pressure means winning feels all the more satisfying. With endless potential for epic combos and moments of tight corroboration, it's a fantasy wargame for the ages.\n\nIt won't suit everyone, but collaboratively pushing back against colonizers is a genuinely refreshing twist on the genre.\n\nOur reviewer has owned Spirit Island for some time, so is deeply familiar with how it works and its quirks. They have played it multiple times as a result.\n\nFor more, be sure to see our guide to how we test board games or the full GamesRadar+ reviews policy if you want a broader overview.\n\nWant a real challenge?

People who are experienced with board games can pick this game up and play fluidly in just a few turns, but it can initially be overwhelming for casual players. The game is quite difficult, especially at first, but everything is tied together very well thematically and is very much less luck based than most cooperative board games; therefore, the (base) game is easier to play and win the more you play, but there are several ways to increase the difficulty once it feels too easy. Everyone playing feels important and all choices matter. Replay value is very high, and nobody I've played it with has had anything negative to say about it.\nPros:\n+ Thematically Consistent\n+ Truly 1-4 players (even single player is fun and challenging)\n+ Various difficulty levels and options for gameplay variation offer high replay value\n+ High-Quality pieces with great art\n+ Very hard to take control of other players - everyone feels important and their choices matter\nPOSSIBLE Cons:\n- Overwhelming at first (many different pieces and gameplay elements)\n- Can be difficult to teach because of the above point\n- Seemingly few 'scenarios' and 'adversaries' (but ultimately enough once you understand how they work)\n- Generally very challenging for new players even with the most simple set-up\nNeutral Points:\n~ Long play time for casual players (30-40 minutes for single player, 60+ minutes with 2 players, and easily 90-120+ minutes with 3 or 4 players, especially if playing with new players)\n~ In-box dividers/piece holders are flimsy and bulky, but box includes many resealable plastic bags for pieces\n~ Random elements are a small part of the game, but are very predictable, fit with the theme, and don't feel 'luck-based'\n~ NOT kid friendly. Don't be fooled by the colourful art - This game is challenging and complex for many adults, and I wouldn't even want to try playing it with anyone younger than a board game savvy 13 year old (I'm thinking of my younger siblings and cousins around that age as examples: some are definitely able to play and some I wouldn't let touch the box)\nThings to keep in mind when first playing the game:\n* If you can, learn the game with 2 players first, with the rule book and online FAQ open - learning with a single player will likely result in a quick and brutal loss that won't teach you enough, and learning with more than 2 players will likely result in a jumbled mess which will take far too long. Playing with several people is much easier when at least one person already knows how to play.\n* USE THE 'EASY' CHARACTERS - Seriously, their rules and powers are much easier to manage, and you can eliminate the deck building portion of the game as you learn the more integral elements\n* Don't be discouraged by the difficulty of the game. This game is hard to beat at first. Once you learn some strategy through trial and error, victory is much easier (which is why scenarios, adversaries, and blighted island cards are in the game, all of which increase the difficulty and/or complexity)\n-\nDr. DGranskad i USA den 15 juli 2022\n5,0 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor A Solo and Co-op Masterpiece Par Excellence\nStil: BasVerifierat k\u00f6pFrom Settlers of Catan to Puerto Rico, there are tons of prominent board games that feature an island being civilized by invading forces. Greater Than Games wanted to ask the question, \u201cWhat if the island fought back?\u201d To answer that question, let\u2019s get to the review!\nOVERVIEW: You play Spirit Island on a board made up of one map per player. Each map is seeded with enemy settlements and allied Dahan natives. Players take their turns simultaneously, beginning by choosing one of their spirit\u2019s growth options which will place presence on the board to allow them to use powers. Doing this lets players often increase either their energy income or the number of cards they can play per turn. They will then select the power cards that they will play for the turn, paying their cost (if any). Some cards are fast and will activate immediately. The invaders then take their turn ravaging some land types, defeating any Dahan there, and blighting the land. They will then build new settlements and other land types, and then send out explorers to repeat the process. The players then resolve any slow powers they played for the turn and discard all cards used for the turn. If the players can defeat enough of the invaders before too much of the land is blighted, they win.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: FOCUSED SIMULTANEOUS PLAY. Because each player begins on their own separate board with limited range on their powers, they can generally focus on the problems facing them on their map. This reduces analysis-paralysis and speeds up the game. But as the game progresses, players will be able to extend their presence to their neighbor\u2019s maps, which slowly ratchets up the cooperation and creates more of a tactical puzzle as the game goes on.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: FEAR EFFECTS. Players have a pool of fear tokens. As settlements are defeated and card effects are resolved, the tokens are moved down to the \u201cgenerated fear\u201d section. When all of the fear has been earned, the tokens are moved up and one fear card is moved down, waiting to be activated later in the turn. When 3 fear cards have been earned, the terror level for the game increases. Increasing the terror level makes both the victory conditions for the game easier and also levels up the powers of the fear cards you earned. The fear cards themselves are a lot of fun. Since you never know what effect they have, they give you random boosts to your strategy.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: TACTICAL PUZZLE. The tactical richness of Spirit Island really is unparalleled. The invader actions are telegraphed multiple turns in advance, giving you time to defeat them. The tactical puzzle gets even more interesting with the use of fast and slow powers. Trying to coordinate how to best use your powers to address the telegraphed invader actions makes this one of the best tactical puzzles in co-op board gaming history.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: VALUE AND VARIETY. Spirit Island comes with 4 scenarios that drastically change the rules of the game. It also comes with 3 different European adversaries for you to face. Each adversary has unique abilities and step-by-step upgrades to provide the exact challenge you want. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, you can even flip the game boards over to get a more challenging but more geographically realistic alternate board setup. All of this gives Spirit Island immense replay value and allows players to adjust the difficulty to the exact level they need.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: SPIRIT DIFFERENTIATION. Each spirit has unique setup rules, abilities, growth and power options, innate powers if they get combos from certain cards, and an entirely unique set of 4 power cards that only they can use. It\u2019s a staggering amount of differentiation, and the game really feels almost completely different each time. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned the ridiculous variety of minor and major powers that you can upgrade your spirit with throughout the game. This can culminate into ridiculous superpowers like lightning bearing down on the land or floods to wash enemy cities away. The variety in how your spirit will play game to game is truly spectacular.\nOVERALL SCORE, a resounding 5 out of 5. Spirit Island is absolutely one of my top co-op games of all time. I just love this game. Both serious and casual players that I\u2019ve introduced the game to have loved it as well. The combination of incredible variety, fast gameplay, and deep tactical puzzles is amazing. To keep my thoughts brief, Spirit Island is a co-op that every gamer should have in their collection. As a side note, the expansion \u201cBranch & Claw\u201d adds a ton of content to the game. I honestly don\u2019t play the game anymore without it. It should also come as no surprise that Spirit Island is excellent when played solo. When I play with just one spirit, I can complete a game in about 30 minutes, which is an amazing amount of gameplay for such a short time invested. Adding in a second spirit makes the puzzle that much tougher and exciting. All of my previous recommendations hold for people who want to play Spirit Island solo. It is GREAT.\nHappy gaming! This is Dr. D, and I\u2019m out!\n-\nLukeGranskad i Kanada den 23 januari 2022\n5,0 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor Great expansion\nStil: Ut\u00f6kningVerifierat k\u00f6pA great expansion.

      "text": "How we test board games at GamesRadar+\nLet us walk you through our process\nIt's our privilege at GamesRadar+ to help you decide which products you should buy and what you're better off avoiding, so how we test board games is very important to everyone on the team. Because your hard-earned cash is involved, it's vital that our content is both informative and of the highest quality.\nThat means a rigorous testing methodology (applied in as objective a way as possible for every brand, use-case, genre, and price point) is needed. With that in mind, our experts have combined their years of knowledge to create a process we use every day - and you can read about it below. Besides breaking down how we test board games in detail, it explains how we justify what deserves a place on buying guides like our roundup best board games. While there's some crossover with the wider GamesRadar+ review policy, you'll also find specific information on the way in which we tackle this unique and vibrant industry.\nA final note before we dive in: All reviews are someone's opinion. It's impossible to be completely, dispassionately objective about any product, so even though we strive to be as balanced as possible, it's OK if you disagree with our decisions. Ours isn't the final word on a game \u2013 it's just what we, the GamesRadar+ team, think.\nCriteria\nTo make sure a consistent testing methodology is being applied to every critique on the site, our reviewers consider the following categories seen below. These boil down to how easy a board game's rules are to understand (listed as 'accessibility'), how replayable it is, its setup and pack-down, component quality, and game mechanics \u2013 AKA the all-important 'fun' factor.\nWhile we touch on all of the above throughout any writeup we do, we rank all these out of five with a brief summary for each point toward the end of every review or buying guide entry. This will be displayed in a table, as seen below.\n| Game mechanics | A bitesize summary of how the game's mechanics hold up, and whether you'll actually enjoy playing. | ? / 5 |\n| Accessibility | Is the game easy to learn? We'll judge that in this section. | ? / 5 |\n| Replayability | We'll briefly discuss how much longevity the game has here. | ? / 5 |\n| Setup and pack-down | Is the game a pain to set up? Does it take a long time to put away? | ? / 5 |\n| Component quality | How will this game's pieces stand up to use? | ? / 5 |\nThe final score a board game gets will be informed by these aspects, represented by an overall star rating out of five.\nMethodology\nWhen testing board games, we'll keep our review and buying guide format in mind as a way of making sure our content is easy to understand at a glance. This forms our methodology, which can be seen below.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nFeatures & design\nWe always start by looking at a board game's specifications, and these are listed in a table that tells you how many players it can have, what kind of game it is (as explained in our guide to the many types of board games), how long an average session lasts, and more useful titbits.\nYou can see an example here:\n| Price | Approximate, listed as $, $$, or $$$ |\n| Ages | Recommended age-rating, e.g. 12+ |\n| Game type | A short description of the game's category |\n| Players | 1 - 4, etc |\n| Lasts | Rough playtime per session |\n| Complexity | Low, moderate, or high |\n| Designers | The person/people who created the game |\n| Publisher | E.g. Asmodee, Ravensburger |\n| Play if you enjoy | A list of similar board games |\nWe then move on to the game's features and design in a broader sense \u2013 both artistic and mechanical. What is the 'elevator pitch?' If it's a sequel or follow-up, what does it do differently? Does it have a particular art style or theme, and do we think these are used effectively?\nComponent quality is also discussed at this stage. We pay particular attention to workmanship and how long we think the pieces will last, not to mention how good a game's component storage solutions are.\nGameplay\nWe spend the vast majority of our time playing \u2013 and living with \u2013 board games when testing them. That's what you'd be doing if you bought the product, so it's only right that we focus our attention on gameplay too.\nOur reviewers start by reading the game's rulebook from cover to cover. This is done in a vacuum; we don't look at guides or how-to-play videos unless they're direct from the manufacturer. We then take notes on how easy those rules are to understand, the way questions or edge-cases are handled, and the book's general layout. Is it easy to follow, or to find the info you're looking for?\nThis feedback will let you know whether a product is actually worth the time you'll spend learning it\u2026 and if it's easy to get your head around in the first place. That's why we always include complexity ratings in our work; it offers an idea of what you're letting yourself in for before hitting checkout.\nAlthough completing every part of a hundred-hour experience with a full complement of players isn't always practical, our reviewers will have run through more than enough to let them definitively comment on whether campaign board games are a worthwhile purchase or not. We will then continue to run through the game's missions after publication if necessary, and may circle back to our critique if opinions have changed.\nWe then play the board game in question multiple times to get an understanding of how the experience holds up after repeat use. This gives us a better sense of its longevity, and whether you'll want to return or not. In addition, our reviewers will be able to comment on the setup / pack down process with more insight as a result.\nAnother focus for our tabletop reviewers is design quality and how a product compares to the competition. For example, has a particular idea been implemented better elsewhere? Our aim is to give the best possible advice, and this includes weighing up where a product falls in the wider world of board games. There's a lot of choice out there, so we want to make sure the investment isn't going to give you buyer's remorse. Are the game's tokens of a high quality or do they pale in comparison to rivals from the same price range? Does it offer a similar experience, but at a lower cost? We aim to find out with each and every write-up. That's why you'll often see 'VS' pieces on the site comparing similar items.\nFinally, we put a lot of stock in the most important criteria of all \u2013 good old-fashioned 'fun.' Board games are meant to be enjoyed, so we'll always report back on our experience and let you know whether we think players will have a good time with the product.\nShould you buy\nWe include a 'should you buy' section at the end of each review to help inform any purchasing decisions, so that question is at the forefront of our minds when testing. This is the time for real talk: Is the product worth what you'll pay for it? And is the price reasonable considering what you get? If we think something else is better value on the whole, we'll flag it here.\nOur team also provides 'buy if' and 'don't buy if' boxes for each review that break things down into bitesize chunks, so we bear these at-a-glance summaries in mind during tests. They normally look like this:\nBuy it if...\n\u2705 You want a team experience\nGame XYZ is all about working together to complete a shared objective, so it's perfect if you don't like competitiveness around the table.\nDon't buy it if...\n\u274c You want something quick\nIf you're looking for a 10-minute party game, XYZ isn't going to cut the mustard; it normally lasts for half an hour or more.\nHow we tested\nWe finish each review with a 'how we tested' section that summarizes our process for that particular board game, allowing you to peek behind the curtain and see how it was all done.\nIn essence, it's top priority that the way we test board games is transparent. We love board games just like you, and that's what we'd want from buying advice.\nOur audience\nWe think it's important to keep readers in mind when testing board games; this ensures that our experts are focusing on things the audience cares about. So, who are we writing for?\nSimply put, our tabletop coverage is designed for everyone. Yes, we cater to longtime fans of the best adult board games who know the difference between Prospero Hall and Avalon Hill. But we also strive to serve newcomers and more casual players of the best family board games as well. This means we won't ever assume knowledge or lean on insider references that may leave any part of our audience feeling lost. As with all GamesRadar+ content, the goal is to educate, entertain, and inform without judgment.\n\"Inform without judgment\" doesn't mean we avoid criticism, though. Board games can be expensive and are also a significant time investment, so we will always be honest about the lows of a product as well as its highs.\nIt's worth pointing out that we revisit reviews on an annual basis, especially if updates are added to the original game. Tabletop gaming is a world of constant iteration, and it's common for new additions to hit the shelves with quality-of-life improvements. As such, it's only fair to make sure our critique reflects this.\nWe don't limit ourselves to the biggest projects by well-known studios, either; part of our job is to surface lesser-known gems you might have missed. By the same token, we won't rigidly stick to tried and tested options. Our team is always on the hunt for cool new ideas to shake up games night, and it doesn't matter whether these products are from AAA developers or indie publishers. We'll look at both premium titles and budget games too. What matters is getting the best products in front of you, no matter where they come from.\nOn much the same note, we prioritize games that are actively available in your area. It's all good and well waxing lyrical about a beloved classic, but that advice isn't much help to anyone if the product in question has gone out of print.\nFor more insight on our team's work behind the scenes, be sure to check out the GamesRadar+ hardware policy.\nI've been writing about games in one form or another since 2012, and now manage GamesRadar+'s tabletop gaming and toy coverage. You'll find my grubby paws on everything from board game reviews to the latest Lego news."

      "text": "Best board games in 2025, with over 25 recommendations reviewed by our experts\nThese essential board games deserve a spot in your collection\nSummer may be heating up, which makes it a great time to kick back and relax with the best board games. There are plenty of options to take on vacation, break out at parties, try with your friends after work, or to play with your partner on date night. The GamesRadar+ team has been covering this industry for years now with news, reviews, and more, so that means we have plenty of advice about what we think deserves a spot in your collection. These recommendations range from old favorites like Catan to fresh-off-the-press trendsetters including Life in Reterra.\nThat's because the best board games aren't just for family get-togethers when you have nothing else to do; this is a vibrant industry overflowing with new ideas to suit any mood.

It takes a long time to play, but the effort is more than worthwhile.\nRead more below\nBest trivia\nDo you like fun facts and amusing trivia? Articulate needs to be on your shelf yesterday. Besides being easy to understand so everyone can get involved (it's like charades, but faster-paced), its questions aren't going to go out of date.\nRead more below\nBest board game overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCatan is a big deal in the tabletop community. For one thing, most agree that it's the perfect 'gateway' into more sophisticated board games. If you're ready to graduate from the likes of Risk or Clue, it eases you in whilst still providing enough complexity for players to sink their teeth into.\nSecondly, it might be one of the most influential games on this list. First published in 1995, it revolutionized the tabletop space and gained global recognition as a result. It also spawned an entirely new genre \u2013 'Eurogames' \u2013 which now dominates the industry. With this in mind, it's hard to argue that Catan doesn't deserve a spot here as one of the best board games overall.\n\u2705 You want a deeper board game that's still accessible: Catan is usually treated as the entry-point to 'hobby' gaming because it balances accessibility with deeper, less chance-based mechanic\n\u2705 You want a stone-cold classic: This is the kind of board game everyone should have on their shelf. Besides being a trendsetter that transformed the space back when it launched, Catan still holds up as a damn good time.\n\u274c Your table is prone to arguing: Seeing as Catan pits you against each other in a struggle for space, rivalries could ensue. Bear that in mind if things can get a little heated around your table.\n\u274c You're used to more complex strategy games: Although it was revolutionary back in 1995 (it spawned an entirely new genre), things have moved on since then. Fans of modern strategy games may find it a little light.\nFeatures & design: At face value, this is a resource-management game where players try to settle the eponymous island of Catan. Because space is limited, you'll all rush to secure resources (from stone to wood) which are used to build settlements and roads. These earn you Victory Points. As you might be able to guess, you'll need them to win.\nSetting up shop next to the hottest goods doesn't guarantee success, though. Resources are given out each turn based on dice rolls, and these values are assigned randomly to an already random board at the beginning of a match. As such, you've got to weigh up probability and how likely something is to pay up ahead of time\u2026 or trade with rivals if you can't get what you need. Because feathers could be ruffled as you all dash to secure the most lucrative spots, this opens an amusing can of worms.\nIn terms of how it looks, Catan is equally forthright. Opting for classic wooden tokens and a realistic, birds-eye-view art style, it doesn't muddy the water with unnecessary pomp.\nGameplay: Even though it's easy to understand, Catan requires cunning if you want to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. You can only get resources if you have a settlement next door, and these can't be placed if someone else owns a town nearby. That makes clever placement crucial, especially because you must build roads to reach certain board spaces. It's all about the bigger picture, so even though produce is given out randomly, foresight is rewarded.\nYou can try to edge a win by building the biggest military, constructing the longest road, or using well-timed cards too. This choose-your-own approach is Catan's biggest contribution to modern board game design; there's no 'right' way to go about things, so you're more in control.\nSocial interaction is encouraged as well, so it's not the kind of board game where you'll be checking your phone between turns. If a resource's number is rolled at the beginning of someone's turn, everyone with a settlement there gets produce. The floor then opens up to trade, which is its own twisty conundrum. Haggling for items may help you in the short term, but it could also bring your opponents closer to victory.\nSimilarly, hoarding resources won't do you any good. If you roll a seven at the start of a turn, the Robber is activated. This little pickle then steals half of every player's cards if they have over seven in their hand. They're then placed onto a tile to stop resource production there. Seeing as the person who rolled that seven gets to choose where the Robber goes, it's your chance to be mean.\nThis has the potential to cause friction if you have an argumentative table, but even that feeds into Catan's metagame. Annoying your rivals will guarantee that they won't trade with you, so even though there are ways around this (you can secure spaces which let players swap one kind of resource for another), it's a wrinkle worth considering. I've been sunk by this particular chestnut in the past, for example; I thought I was being clever by handicapping my biggest opponent's resources, but then I needed something only they had. Understandably, they told me to get stuffed when I approached them like Oliver Twist with an empty bowl.\nThat's why Catan has endured for 30 years in a nutshell \u2013 it makes memories. This isn't the kind of board game you sleepwalk through.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Catan revolutionized tabletop gaming and kicked off an entire genre when it launched. It's still just as compelling today. Because it rewards skill and forethought, victory is all the more satisfying. | 4 / 5 |\nAccessibility | Even though it's by no means 'simple,' Catan is very easy to get your head around. It's the perfect gateway game for those graduating from Clue, Risk, or Monopoly. | 4 / 5 |\nReplayability | Thanks to a randomized board and its focus on probability, you can keep coming back to Catan and get a different experience every time. | 5 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Putting the randomized board together with all its number tokens can be a faff at first, but it's not so bad once you've got the hang of things. | 5 / 5 |\nComponent quality | The artwork of Catan is iconic, but the latest version improves on a design that was starting to get long in the tooth. The tokens and board pieces are sturdy enough to survive a nuclear attack, too. | 4 / 5 |\n\"Catan sparked a revolution when it launched in the '90s, and gaming was changed for the better with its arrival. It isn't a relic better left in the past, however; it still holds up. Its core loop remains as engaging now as it was decades ago, and a wealth of ways to win gives you an agency you don't always get with family-friendly games.\" Read more: Catan review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nFor RPG fans\nIf you want another game which changed the industry forever, look no further than this. As mentioned in our Gloomhaven review, the sprawling epic takes dungeon-crawling mechanics and builds them into an adventure unlike anything else.\nFor co-op\nThe Pandemic series had already made a name for itself when it got in on the 'Legacy' craze where your actions have consequences that carry into your next match, and the result is arguably better than the original game.\nFor families\nThis award-winner is beyond popular, and its appeal is understandable; it's as engrossing as it is chilled-out. The artwork is beautiful too, and it's competitive without being overbearing. Like we say in our Wingspan review, it's one of the modern greats.\nBest board game for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTicket to Ride is one of the most laid-back entries on this list, and that makes it the perfect choice if you want the best family board games that aren't going to start a civil war around the table. Thoughtful and relaxing, it's a delight for all ages that lets players tackle the challenge at their own pace.\nIt does still have tactical bite, though. More specifically, figuring out the best way from A to B whilst working around roadblocks laid by your rivals is an engaging puzzle.\n\u2705 You want something easy but fun: Looking for a game that's accessible, but not boring? Despite being easy to understand, there's still enough strategy here to keep you interested.\n\u2705 The people you're playing with aren't board gamers: Even if your opponents have never played anything more exotic than Monopoly, they'll still be able to get involved easily enough.\n\u274c You want something that'll challenge you: Even though there are tactics on display in Ticket to Ride, it's not going to stretch you. This is a fairly laid-back experience overall.\n\u274c You'll be playing it a lot: Ticket to Ride can get a little tired if you overdo it. It got me through lockdown during the pandemic via virtual matches with family, but eventually we learned all the routes and the game lost its shine.\nFeatures & design: Picture the scene - it's the early 1900s, top hats are in, and trains are still of the steam variety. In this quaint landscape of frilly frocks and tail-coats, you've got to plot railway routes from one city to another. Whoever completes the most lucrative lines will win.\nSounds easy so far, right? And to an extent, it is; you couldn't call Ticket to Ride an overly competitive game. That's why it's such a good board game for families. There isn't as much opportunity for squabbling, which is something I think we can all appreciate after Christmas sessions of Monopoly gone wrong.\nYou shouldn't expect to coast, though. You need sets of differently-colored train cards to lay down routes, and because these are taken from either a face-up market available to everyone or drawn blind, others might work out what you need and beat you to the punch by taking those cards first. Plus, not completing routes will dock your score at the end of the game. This adds a push-your-luck element to proceedings.\nWith Ticket to Ride's turn-of-the-century vibe, that's fitting; it's couched in a time when the world was your oyster. There's an appealing steampunk tinge to everything as a result, and even the tokens have gone the extra mile thanks to being fully 3D carriages.\nGameplay: The railway theme may not light your world on fire, but there's an undercurrent of strategy holding everything together that allows it to hit the perfect balance of family-friendliness without losing any tactical complexity. That makes Ticket to Ride one of the best board games even if its players haven't ventured much beyond Scrabble.\nIt's not overly aggressive, either. Unlike so many entries on this list, there's less emphasis on screwing each other over. Although it is possible to ruin someone's day by building across their route, there's usually an alternative with which you can salvage all that time and effort. As such, Ticket to Ride is something I'm more than happy to break out if things typically get heated at family gatherings. Like our review mentions, it's \"the perfect option for newcomers and tabletop veterans alike.\"\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | This is a straightforward system, but it excels in spite of \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 that. It's easy to grasp, but there's a lot to think about during each session. | 4 / 5 |\nAccessibility | Ticket to Ride's simplicity makes it very easy to get into, and most will have no trouble learning its ins and outs. | 4 / 5 |\nReplayability | While it does have some longevity, you will eventually learn the routes if you play on repeat. That robs the game of some sparkle. | 3 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | In spite of a slightly more laborious pack-down (you've got to gather up dozens of train models), nothing else here is taxing. | 4 / 5 |\nComponent quality | Due to plastic train tokens, quality card stock, and a sturdy board, Ticket to Ride won't fall at the last hurdle. | 5 / 5 |\n\"A tense but incredibly rewarding experience that opens itself up to strategy and logic just as easily as it does creative thinking and social play.\" Read more: Ticket to Ride review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nPuzzle perfection\nThanks to brilliantly simple yet engrossing tile-laying mechanics that have you building a patchwork landscape for points, Carcassonne is a modern classic. As we mentioned in our Carcassonne review, it offers \"heaps of replayability.\"\nQuick and easy\nTrying to find board games without confusing rules? Herd Mentality says hello. It's easy to get the hang of and won't ever go out of date, because it hinges on what everyone else thinks. There's no 'right' answer \u2013 your aim is to be in the majority.\nFor travel\nIt looks very simple, but I'd recommend Bananagrams to any fan of word games in a heartbeat. It tasks you with creating a crossword using the randomly drawn tiles in front of you, so requires lateral thinking and quick reflexes.\nBest board game for 2 players\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAs the runaway success of 2024, Sky Team is taxiing its way onto more than a few wishlists. (That's the perk of winning a prestigious Spiel des Jahres award, I suppose.) Happily, it lives up to the hype; this is an engrossing exercise in teamwork that really makes you feel closer to one another because you're forced to overcome limited communication. That makes it great for couples.\nIt's also been designed specifically with two people in mind, and is small enough to take on the go. In other words? It's a textbook definition of what the best 2-player board games should look like. Rather than trying to please everyone with mechanics that scale for a crowd, it's laser-focused on providing the best experience for a pair.\n\u2705 You want a very replayable, portable game: Thanks to a wealth of scenarios and numerous mechanics drip-fed over time, Sky Team should impress. Because it's a fairly contained game that packs away into a reasonably-sized box, it's a great on-the-go option too.\n\u2705 You want a game you can learn together: As the name would suggest, Sky Team is all about teamwork and coordination\u2026 and those skills will be put to the test as its scenarios become more challenging.\n\u274c You don't like limited-communication games: You aren't able to talk with your co-pilot once dice are rolled (you need to find other ways to communicate), so chatter-boxes may struggle here.\n\u274c You hate flying: A game where you have to land a plane, and can potentially crash it, may not be the best fit for aerophobes.\nFeatures & design: Sky Team bundles you into the cockpit and asks you to land a plane without reducing it to a smear across the runway. In true jet-setting fashion, you and your co-pilot will fly across the world to airports which offer unique challenges.\nBecause each player contributes dice to control everything from speed to angle of approach, being on the same page is crucial. If you aren't in sync, things will quickly go pear-shaped. This is why those dice are rolled in secret and you aren't allowed to tell each other what you've got \u2013 you'll need to think up another way of communicating.\nThis is capped off with a board modelled on aeronautical instruments, so you'll certainly feel the part. Actually, that's one of my favorite things about the game; it looks much more lavish than you'd expect for the price.\nGameplay: Seeing as you can't talk once those dice have been rolled, it's hard not to become invested in Sky Team from the start. This isn't something you can play on autopilot \u2013 pun very much intended. Problem-solving together is baked into its DNA.\nOK, I'll admit that this can be stressful. But if you want a challenge, you'll find one here. It doesn't throw you in at the deep end, either. Designer Luc R\u00e9mond has done a great job of easing you into harder objectives, not to mention drip-feeding new mechanics that shake things up.\nAs an example, perks are available to balance the scales \u2013 you can spend reroll tokens to undo a bad result or deploy a coffee to adjust the number up or down. Working out when to break out these bonuses is a significant part of Sky Team's strategy.\nThe result is a game that seizes you by the collar and refuses to let go. If you can only get one board game for 2 players, make it this one.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Because it's specifically designed for two people, Sky Team is laser-focused on providing the best possible experience for just a couple of players. It'll bring you closer together thanks to an edge-of-your seat system where you can't communicate with one another normally, and that ratchets up suspense. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | You'd think a game about flying planes would be complicated, but it's actually very straightforward. It's also good at introducing new mechanics piece by piece. | 4 / 5 |\nReplayability | Sky Team includes plenty of scenarios with their own challenges to overcome, so it's primed for repeat-visits. | 4 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | This game doesn't take up loads of room when set up, so it's fairly easy to lay out and put away. | 4 / 5 |\nComponent quality | Whether it's thanks to a board that's inspired by an aeroplane cockpit or hard-wearing tokens which aren't going to be easily damaged, Sky Team impresses. | 4 / 5 |\n\"If you're trying to find something you can play as a couple or take with you on vacation, Sky Team is reporting for duty.

It's essentially tabletop Tetris, except you're trying to fill your board with quilt patches. You lose points for blank spaces at the end, so you'd better get your thinking cap on.\nBest co-op board game\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe odds are against you from the start in Pandemic, but that's the beauty of it. This team-based epic is never less than thrilling, and it doesn't feel hopeless either. Despite being tasked with curing a clutch of super-diseases, good communication (not to mention the ability to think on your feet) will see you through. Want satisfying cooperative board games for your collection? This should be at the top of the pile.\nSure, its theme hits closer to home nowadays. But there's something cathartic about giving a pandemic the boot\u2026 even if it's only in this tabletop world of tokens and cards.\n\u2705 You want a gripping team game: Battling each other for supremacy can be exhausting, especially if the people you're playing with are competitive. That makes this co-op challenge a breath of fresh air. You win or lose together, and good communication is essential.\n\u2705 You're looking for a challenge: This game doesn't take any prisoners, and that makes it all the more enthralling. You'll find yourself pushed to the brink as you wrestle with its clever mechanics.\n\u274c You don't like pressure: Tensions run high in Pandemic (you are saving the world, after all), so anyone that doesn't like pressure in games won't enjoy it.\n\u274c You want something easy: Want to avoid raising your blood pressure? It's probably better to stay away from this one - part of the fun in Pandemic is that it forces you to strategize on the fly.\nFeatures & design: You're racing against the clock in Pandemic - you've got to contain and cure four deadly diseases that are sweeping across the globe. Naturally, this is far from a walk in the park. For starters, new infections (represented by dinky cubes) are placed on random cities each turn. If enough cases gather in one place, they'll spill into neighboring areas in a devastating domino effect. To make matters worse, the number of infections deployed each turn increases over the course of the game. Spin your wheels and you'll get overwhelmed.\nThis leaves you with a difficult choice: research a cure by collecting cards (at which point the game stops placing infections for that particular disease), or remove infections at a local level so you can keep things under control.\nThe game's visuals amp up this tension with a style taken from the CSI playbook. Although the movers are basic, single-color pawns, everything else feels flashy. It's the sort of thing you'd expect to see displayed on a massive screen while someone says something dramatic, like \"my god - San Francisco has fallen.\"\nWell, apart from the disease cubes. I've always thought that those could pass for sweets, which is pretty distracting on the whole. (Ah, forbidden jellies - how delicious you seem.)\nGameplay: Pandemic's balance of risk and reward secures its throne as one of the best board games overall. Is it better to keep disease levels down so that they don't spread from city to city in the short term, or should you play the long game and go all-in on developing cures? There's no right answer, and this puts the power into your hands. Random chance dictates which cards get drawn from turn turn, of course, but everything else is all down to your strategy.\nMore importantly, that question will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I've rarely seen our board group more invested than when they're playing Pandemic, and the need to constantly change your battleplan on the fly means that communication is vital - a must for co-op games.\nIt's true that all this can be stressful. But it's also gripping. As mentioned in our review, such white-knuckle decision-making \"shows off everything tabletop gaming is capable of.\"\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | There aren't many co-op board games that can so elegantly balance tension and teamwork. This is a masterclass in strategy. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | It may look intimidating, but Pandemic is pretty easy to get your head around. Mastering it is a whole other matter, though. | 3 / 5 |\nReplayability | Infections are placed at randomly-selected locations at the start of the game and can spread in any number of directions, creating a cascading domino effect of possibility. That means there should be plenty to keep you busy. | 5 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | While it isn't a chore to lay out, Pandemic does require you to place a number of 'disease' cubes around the board before play begins. More will be used throughout the game, so there's quite a lot to put away once you're done. | 3 / 5 |\nComponent quality | Thanks to a design reminiscent of CSI thriller shows and hardy tokens (be it the cures or tiny disease cubes), there's little to complain about here. | 5 / 5 |\n\"There's no real board game canon, but if there were, Pandemic would clearly be included. While the subject matter might sound particularly dark, the actual mechanics of where to place resources are straightforward and serve as a good shift from map-based games like Risk to more crunchy titles.

Despite being quite long, the struggle between traitors, other players, and monsters will have you on the edge of your seat... which is why our Unfathomable review was so glowing.\nBest party board game\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFinding the right party game can be tough. You've got to account for numerous tastes, it can't take too long to play, and it shouldn't use up much space at the table either (if any). It's a task worthy of Mission Impossible, and that's why I gravitate towards Codenames when my friends get together.\nThis spy-themed game challenges you to track down secret agents before your rivals can, and victory hinges on word associations. That means it has a really straightforward concept that anyone can pick up. What's more, Codenames gets people talking, is suitable for a larger group, and doesn't require lots of room to set up. Crucially, you may learn a thing or two about each other along the way\u2026\n\u2705 You're playing with a larger group: Codenames is a 'the more the merrier' kind of game, so it's perfect if you have a lot of players itching for a game.\n\u2705 You want a great icebreaker: Picking the right card will hinge on clues from your spymaster, so it's a good way of getting into other players' heads.\n\u274c You aren't a fan of big-group games: Codenames is best when played with the full roster of eight, so you may want to pick something else if you prefer smaller crowds.\n\u274c You crack under pressure: Coming up with word associations carries a degree of pressure, especially if your teammates aren't patient.\nFeatures & design: Your mission, if you choose to accept it, involves dividing into teams (red or blue) and laying out 25 randomly-drawn word cards into a five-by-five grid. Secret agents or innocent bystanders are hidden under these cards, but only two players \u2013 'spymasters' for each team \u2013 know where they are. Find all your secret agents to win.\nTo help their team pick the right card, spymasters take it in turns to give clues. This is a single word associated with one or more cards on the board, along with a number for how many cards that word connects to. (As an example, you might say \"war, two\" so that your team picks 'battleship' and 'missile.') If players select the wrong card and hit an innocent bystander, the turn ends immediately. Everyone has to watch out for the lone assassin, too; if this is selected, it's game over.\nNaturally, this is wrapped up in classic spy iconography. We're talking sunglasses, dapper suits, and slick hairstyles that feel as if they could belong to James Bond. Meanwhile, the word cards are modelled after those manilla envelopes that contain spicy secrets in thriller movies.\nGameplay: Even though it packs a simple concept, there's an iceberg's worth of depth under the surface here. Should spymasters play it safe by going through each card one by one, knowing that their opponents may pull ahead? Or is it better to connect multiple words as best you can, even if there's a risk players will choose the wrong card?\nThat's the devious brilliance of Codenames. Yes, the cards are randomly drawn. However, plenty of them can be lumped together in the same category \u2013 and you may not realize this until too late. I can't tell you the amount of times my team has gotten the right answer\u2026 before talking themselves out of it and choosing something completely tangential. It's hilarious, infuriating, and memorable in equal measure. (Tread carefully if you have overly-competitive friends, because they may not take kindly to mistakes.)\nThanks to the sheer volume of cards included in the box, and the amount of permutations you can get every match by mixing them up, this is the kind of game that doesn't get old. It'll play very differently based on who's around the table, too. In other words, you won't get tired of it any time soon.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Codenames may seem straightforward, but it's hiding depth and can be wonderfully mind-bending. | 5/5 |\nAccessibility | Everyone will be able to get their head around Codenames with very little effort. | 5/5 |\nReplayability | Numerous double-sided cards and everyone's unique reaction to them provides more replayability than most board games dream of. | 5/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | It can take a moment to set up the 5x5 card grid, but it's not much effort on the whole. | 4/5 |\nComponent quality | This game may not be flashy, but it doesn't really need to be \u2013 it handles the spy aesthetic beautifully. | 4/5 |\n\"Codenames is the ultimate pick-up-and-play party game. No complex mechanics to trip up new players \u2014 just a word association game with some structure around it, and a competitive edge to spice things up. Don't let that simplicity fool you, though. There is a ton of depth and strategy on offer here for experienced players to sink their teeth into.The key to Codenames's success as a party game is that it's all about communication and getting on the same wavelength as your teammates.

It's way too much fun.\nHumanity is rebuilding after society collapsed, and it's your job to construct the best settlement whilst taking advantage of relics like the mysterious AA battery. (What could it be for? Who knows.) This results in a tongue-in-cheek rush to the finish that's incredibly moreish. It's one of the best adult board games by a long way.\n\u2705 You want an accessible but engaging strategy game: Want a more in-depth board game that's still easy to understand? Life in Reterra fits the bill. It's very accommodating for newcomers but has a wealth of options that'll take time to master.\n\u2705 Longevity is important to you: Looking to get maximum value for money? Life in Reterra ticks the box. Because its cards and buildings can be mixed and matched for wildly different results, there's always a new challenge to experience.\n\u274c You want a complex strategy game: That 'lite' approach is a double-edged sword. If you're expecting it to go up against games like Twilight Imperium or Scythe, you'll be disappointed.\n\u274c You have limited table space: Life in Reterra won't take up loads of room, but it sprawls out if you have more players.\nFeatures & design: Unlike most post-apocalypses, there isn't a zombie or viking-themed gang anywhere in sight here. Instead, everyone's recycling remnants of civilization into something new \u2013 and better. That old plane, for instance? It'd make a good school. What about that massive radar dish? The perfect soccer pitch, I'd say. You'll place these buildings on an ever-expanding board in a quest to construct the perfect village.\nIn a fitting twist, Life in Reterra recycles old ideas as well. It takes the ideas laid down by games like Carcassonne and molds them into an entirely fresh experience. What follows may seem like a tile-laying exercise, but you've got to think hard about where you place those pieces. Buildings that earn you points or bonuses have to be put on cog symbols, and you're only allowed to construct something if it's at least partially on a tile you just laid down. Whoever gets the highest score at the end will win, so you better think ahead. Particularly because the game finishes once you've put down 16 tiles\u2026\nThat means you can't spend too long admiring the scenery, even if you'll want to. With the exception of a weirdly dull beige board where buildings are stored, this is a beautiful game; it opts for a vibrant cartoon aesthetic instead of dreary realism. It comes with excellent plastic tubs to put your pieces into as well, ensuring those tokens won't be flying everywhere when packed away in the box.\nGameplay: You'll often find yourself wishing you had more time during Life in Reterra. That's how it gets its claws into you \u2013 there's always a \"what if.\" Due to short rounds which wrap up faster than you might expect, you'll be eager to reset and try something new you only thought of at the end of a match. I certainly am, and as someone who reviews the best board games for a living, this is a rarity.\nThere's a compelling risk/reward element at play here as well. You can only place buildings if they're partially on a tile you've just put down, and there are never enough cogs on a single piece. This leads to the quandary of whether you slap buildings down whenever you can, or hold off in the hope you can connect tiles for something bigger and more lucrative later on. That kind of mental Tetris is why Life in Reterra excels as a board game for adults; it exercises your gray matter and rewards repeat play with a regular group.\nEach of the game's (many) buildings provide different and increasingly tempting rewards, you see, so they're worth messing with. Seeing as you can also mix and match these to create entirely new building sets with unique interplay, there's months of gameplay here to grapple with if you're willing to dive down the rabbit hole.\nI'll admit that matches can end just as you're getting into them. Yet this is precisely why it works; you're always left wanting more. And yes, it doesn't have as much depth as other hobby games. But it's a superb middle-ground between the likes of Catan and Scythe, so I think it'll serve most people well.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Life in Reterra's greatest strength is that it doesn't try too hard. Its systems are simple but incredibly compelling, and this rock-solid foundation is built upon with increasingly interesting ideas later in the game. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | This is pitched as a 'lite' strategy game, which means it isn't a chore to learn. You can be grappling with it in no time. | 4 / 5 |\nReplayability | Due to a wealth of building cards that can be mixed and matched however you see fit, you'll struggle to run out of things to do. | 5 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | The addition of well-made storage tubs make this one hell of a lot easier to put away, and the fact you start from a single tile means setup is a breeze too. | 4 / 5 |\nComponent quality | Besides those storage cases to keep your tokens and cards tidy, Life in Reterra feels built to last. Its artwork is vivid and eye-popping as well, setting itself apart from the usual brown post-apocalypses. | 5 / 5 |\n\"The best board games get better the more you play and understand them, so Life in Reterra has earned its place at the table.

When combined with near-limitless card combos and compelling bluffing mechanics, this is far from bad or ugly.\nNSFW\nThe beauty of this funny party game is how it sets you up to fail. It challenges you to draw certain things that are bound to be misinterpreted in amusing, often rude ways, so it'll go down very well with friends (something we noted in our Scrawl review).\nBest board game for kids\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKing of Tokyo is the ideal choice for both big and little monsters. Allowing you to command tongue-in-cheek kaiju (ranging from Space Penguins to classic Godzilla-wannabes) that are intent on squishing the city, it's all about pushing your luck. You earn points by stomping across Japan's capital, but this opens you up to attack from other players. The trick is knowing when to stick it out or when to make a hasty retreat, and this will keep everyone around the table invested.\nIt's a great introduction to board game strategy, in other words. When combined with the amusingly silly concept, there's plenty for kids to love here \u2013 it's one of the best board games for kids by a long way.\n\u2705 You want something accessible but compelling: This isn't a game you'll struggle to understand, yet it won't leave you feeling bored either.\n\u2705 You want something parents will enjoy too: Don't worry folks, you should enjoy this as much as your little ones. It's fantastic for all ages.\n\u274c You have young children: Although it's straightforward, the strategy and pressure involved may not agree with particularly little kids.\n\u274c Your children take things very personally: Hitting Tokyo puts a target on your back, and your monster will be attacked a lot. With that in mind, sensitive kids may feel picked on (even if they're not).\nFeatures & design: As you might expect from a board game about wanton destruction, King of Tokyo isn't difficult to understand. You need to earn points by attacking the city, and players do this by placing your character on that board space when it's empty. The longer you stick around, the more points you'll get\u2026 and if you can earn 20 points overall, you'll win.\nHowever, victory won't come easy. Anyone in Tokyo is open to attack from rivals, and they can't heal while there. Basically, you're playing a game of chicken with your monster.\nRegardless of where your monster is, your actions are dictated by dice rolls. Getting the claw symbol allows you to hurt rivals, hearts let you heal, and rolling three of a particular number earns bonus points. The latter can be tricky, so you're allowed to reroll some or all of your dice up to three times per turn. To translate, King of Tokyo is great for risk-assessment.\nNot that you'd know that at a glance. This is a wonderfully goofy game with endearing, cartoonish artwork.\nGameplay: Hurling dice across the table and hoping for a good result is always thrilling, and King of Tokyo builds on that by adding a sprinkling of danger. Should you hold on for as long as possible in Tokyo itself to nab extra points, even though it's as good as putting a bullseye around your neck? Or is it better to let your opponents bleed themselves dry before swooping in yourself? There isn't a 'right' answer, and that makes for a tense balancing act that keeps everyone on the edge of their seat.\nThere's plenty to think about as a result, but not in a way that'll bog kids down.

This dungeon-crawling epic taps into all that with branching storylines more commonly seen in the best tabletop RPGs, and it makes skilful use of 'Legacy' mechanics where the consequences of your actions carry across from one session to the next.\nSeeing as it's more accessible than the original Gloomhaven (and much less expensive), this is a great place to start regardless of whether you intend to tackle other entries in the series or just want a taste of adventure. Yes, it's more complex than many other board games. But it's also a whole lot better.\n\u2705 You want an epic adventure game: Seeing as you'll be embarking on grand adventures and crawling through dungeons each session, Jaws of the Lion will hit the spot if you're in the mood for some swords 'n' sorcery. Plus, the fact that you level up your characters over time should scratch that RPG itch too.\n\u2705 You want your choices to matter: Because your decisions are carried over from session to session, what you do really does matter. The world feels much more alive and infinitely more memorable than most other games on your shelf as a result.\n\u274c You want something simple: Despite being a lot more accessible than standard Gloomhaven (it was pitched as an easier way into the game), Jaws of the Lion is still a lot denser than most board games. Keep that in mind before hitting the checkout.\n\u274c You're expecting it to be as deep as standard Gloomhaven: The original Gloomhaven (not to mention its sequel, Frosthaven) defines 'sprawling fantasy epic.' Indeed, it'll take you months to finish. Even though Jaws of the Lion has plenty of depth, it's nowhere near as big. If you're expecting it to be on par with its predecessor, you'll be disappointed.\nFeatures & design: Jaws of the Lion casts you as a mercenary looking for work in the grungy metropolis of Gloomhaven (imagine the world of The Witcher and you won't be far off). As is only right for fantasy RPGs, said 'work' involves swords and/or sorcery. These jobs lead you through a grand narrative where your choices matter, so tread carefully. Decisions can, and will, have consequences.\nWhile that sounds intense, the game has been designed with accessibility in mind. Unlike the full Gloomhaven or its sequel, Frosthaven, this one is smaller in scale and drip-feeds everything you need to know piece by piece. That includes a novel combat system which gets rid of random dice rolls. Rather than leaving success up to luck, all of your movement or attack actions are divvied up onto cards instead. The challenge lies in deciding which ones to use - and when.\nThe same handsome tokens and components have made their way across from Gloomhaven, though. Actually, I'd argue that its map board (upon you which you slap stickers to represent the missions you've completed) is better-looking than its predecessor.\nOK, so the models may still be clunky in comparison to rivals like Descent: Legends of the Dark and Bardsung. Yet everything else sings, especially that moody artwork for your foes.\nGameplay: Few board games can match the sense of agency in OG Gloomhaven, and it's no different for Jaws of the Lion. Along with upgrades for your character that'll provide a more personal connection with them, battles being so skill-based makes victory all the sweeter. Your clever tactics saw you through, not luck of the dice. And while there is still a steep learning curve, it's far less intimidating than its predecessors.\nIt's also worth persevering with. Honestly, there's nothing quite like the combat of this series. Trying to figure out the best combination of actions to use at any one time is a compelling mini-game in itself, and juggling your limited resources (you'll lose cards as you progress) makes for a challenging puzzle.\nSeeing as you'll have to balance helping your allies with hunting loot that can improve your hero, there's also a sizzling unease to keep you on the edge of your seat. Can your friends be trusted in a pinch, or are they more interested in helping themselves?\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | The creator of Gloomhaven isn't a fan of how many roleplaying games rely on luck, so endeavoured to create a purely skill-based system. It paid off here, and those mechanics are the perfect companion to a world where choice is paramount. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | Even though it's a much better entry-point than the original Gloomhaven, this is still more complicated than other board games. | 3 / 5 |\nReplayability | With such emphasis on 'Legacy' elements (where the consequences of your actions carry across to the next session), it's tough to revisit Jaws of the Lion unless you want to start over or have invested in non-permanent stickers. | 3 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | It's nothing compared to its predecessors, but Jaws of the Lion is still a well-stocked game with a lot of pieces to put into place. Still, its campaign book removes the need for separate board tiles. | 3 / 5 |\nComponent quality | This is the ultimate fantasy game thanks to incredible artwork and highly thematic pieces that make it feel as if you've stumbled upon a forgotten treasure chest of fantasy goodies. | 5 / 5 |\n\"Jaws of the Lion takes a dungeon-crawling experience that is expansive and epic, and makes it slightly less expansive \u2026 but no less epic. This hefty chunk of fantasy co-op goodness will take you through many a session of monster battling and exploration. Narrative does take a bit of a backseat here but I\u2019d argue that looking cool and looting treasure is a sufficient backstory for any adventurer.\" Read more: Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nThe definitive RPG\nIf you tried and loved Jaws of the Lion, it's time to graduate to Frosthaven. This sprawling epic takes those mechanics and builds them out into a grand adventure - one that's both slicker and smarter than Gloomhaven.\nNew adventures\nAs pointed out in our Arydia: The Paths We Dare Tread review, this new RPG game \"manages to give everyone something D&D can't match.\" That's high praise indeed, and the sense of communal energy given off here makes it feel positively vibrant.\nTop-notch tech\nI've always got time for a fantasy adventure, but Descent truly impressed me. A clever blend of tabletop gameplay and app-based enemies bring the experience to life in a way few of its rivals can. It's the perfect blend of video games and tabletop adventure.\nBest strategy board games\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLooks can be deceiving, and Root is the perfect example. Despite an inviting art-style, this is about as hardcore a strategy game as it gets. Alright, so the action takes place in a quiet woodland realm. However, all is not well beneath those trees. The animals living there want to kick the stuffing out of each other, and you'll need to hatch schemes that'll put your faction on top.\nSo long as you're happy to do a little homework in terms of its mechanics, you'll find that Root has a lot to offer. It's essential for strategy fans thanks to spotless asymmetric gameplay, and being able to boost the experience with a number of expansions keeps that spark alive.\n\u2705 You love deep strategy games: Root may look cute and cuddly, but it's ruthless. The tactics on display here are some of the industry's best, and because each faction has its own rules and objectives, there's plenty to grapple with.\n\u2705 You want something you can really get your teeth into: This is the sort of game that gets better after repeat sessions - you'll only truly grasp what your faction can do after using them a few times. In short, the more you play, the better your matches will be.\n\u274c You're turned off by dense rules: There's no way to sugarcoat this - the rules of Root are intimidating. Due to each faction having its own mechanics on top of an already-complex system, you'll need to spend time swotting up on how to play before you place your first meeple on the board. Naturally, that won't appeal to everyone.\n\u274c You can't commit to multiple playthroughs: Root is at its best when you can return to it over and over, so anyone that isn't able to do so will have more luck with other games.\nFeatures & design: Much like the Redwall novels, each player commands a tribe of anthropomorphic creatures that must fight to control the forest's clearings. (In practical terms, that means collecting 30 'Victory Points.') The base game gives you control of four factions: the 'Marquise de Cat' that must cement their rule by putting down rebellion, feudal birds who operate via espionage, an insurgency of 'peasant' animals (mice and hedgehogs) called the Woodland Alliance, and an adventuring racoon who sneaks around the board. Each one has its own unique playstyle, and although there's a lot to take in, it encourages you to think creatively.\nFortunately, the nuts and bolts of battle are much more straightforward. Players simply roll dice and compare results to see how a fight turns out, with more meeples being able to deal greater damage. That allows you to get a sense of how combat will turn out just by looking at the pieces you've got on the board. Throw crafting and special abilities into the mix (found on a deck of special cards that you'll draw on throughout the game) for a heady tactical cocktail.\nNot that you'd be able to tell from how Root looks. It carries a charming aesthetic by the hugely talented Kyle Ferrin that is reminiscent of Mouse Guard, and few board games in this guide can match the personality he brings to bear.\nWhile you'd expect his work to be found across cards and the board itself, it's neat that his design extends to Root's playing pieces too. Rather than being plain wooden meeples in the shape of animals, these ones have expressive eyes that bring them to life.\nGameplay: First things first - be aware that there is a learning curve here. While our review called it \"the most accessible complex wargame,\" Root is still a complicated beast that requires some investment. There's a payoff, though. Persevere and you'll wind up with one hell of a strategy board game.\nI've never seen two games go the same way, for instance. Each factions' quirks (and the cards that can influence them) provide a wealth of options each turn, and while this is overwhelming at first, such flexibility makes Root truly compelling in the long-term. It's incredibly replayable.\nSimilarly, the simplicity of its combat isn't a drawback. The fact that meeples can only move into spaces their faction controls (or where they have a numerical advantage) allows clever generals to squeeze opponents into a corner. Well-timed bonuses also add texture to this elegant yet rich system.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | As with so many of the best board games, Root isn't content to leave each player with the same objectives. Every faction handles differently and wants something unique, so the interplay between them is top-tier so far as strategy goes. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | The effort is more than worth your while, but players will need to put in some time to learn this one. | 2 / 5 |\nReplayability | Although the game's complexity makes it less accessible than others, that increases its replayability by a significant amount. | 5 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | It doesn't have the most complicated setup, but Root isn't exactly a game you can break out on impulse. | 3 / 5 |\nComponent quality | Kyle Ferrin's mesmerizing artwork pairs brilliantly with quaint wooden meeples for an incredibly wholesome aesthetic. | 5 / 5 |\n\"A masterful application of asymmetry in board games, Root manages to weave a tale of four distinct factions duking it out in the forest that never feels unbalanced. Turning your hand to the skills of one faction, you might find your wings in the slow-burn strategy of the Eyrie Dynasty, or dig your claws into the industry-centric Marquise de Cat, but no matter your favored strat, no game is ever the same.\" Read more: Root review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nA fan favorite\nIn an unexpected twist, this board game is one of the best-rated titles out there.

See our Arcs review for more.\nBest horror board game\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEver wonder how long you'd last in a horror movie? Betrayal at House on the Hill lets you find out. Setting players loose in a haunted mansion that's quite literally out to get them, it's drenched with tension. It's also unpredictable enough that you're never sure what's going to happen next.\nSure, not all of the scenarios are created equal. But if you're hunting down something more mature in terms of both narrative and gameplay, I'd say that this takes the cake. There are scarier horror games as well, but this will be the best board game for most people due to its blend of accessibility with tactical gameplay and narrative.\n\u2705 You want a deeper, more immersive experience: Even though it's accessible, Betrayal has more meat on the bone in terms of strategy than rivals. It's a decent step up from classic family games in terms of narrative, too.\n\u2705 You love adventure games: If you're a fan of games that emphasize exploration, it doesn't get much better than this. Discovering new rooms is a cornerstone of Betrayal, and the plot is inseparable from its mechanics. Because there are 50 scenarios on offer, you can also play for months without seeing everything.\n\u274c You want something easygoing: Looking for a simple party game that'll only last 20 minutes or so? This ain't it, chief. Despite being accessible on the whole, it's still far more complex than classics such as Clue.\n\u274c You don't like random elements: This game relies on randomly-drawn board tiles and cards that'll dictate what happens next. If this kind of unpredictability doesn't appeal, Betrayal probably isn't for you.\nFeatures & design: Your aim here is simple \u2013 make it out of the mansion alive. That isn't to say it's predictable, though. Betrayal isn't set up like traditional board games, which is part of its appeal. Your character has been drawn to the house for mysterious reasons (they're following a friend who's gone missing or have received a strange invitation, for example), and each room is selected at random when you enter it. The items or events encountered within are randomized as well. In short, there's no way of telling what lurks behind those doors.\nThe only thing you do know is that one of the game's scenarios will eventually begin, dictated by the rooms and items you've drawn. This mission turns your allies \u2013 or the mansion itself \u2013 against you. Seeing as both sides are given secret objectives to follow, the result is an anxious yet exhilarating race against time.\nStill, this isn't a grim and gritty misery-fest. The latest edition is surprisingly vibrant, and its sense of humor lightens the mood considerably.\nGameplay: This game's deadly twist on guess-who keeps you coming back for more. Which player is going to be unmasked as a traitor? And what will their mission be? With several-dozen imaginative scenarios under its belt, the novelty won't wear off anytime soon. Actually, I've still not seen everything these dusty halls have to offer despite playing the game for years. That puts Betrayal one step ahead of more formulaic (though still excellent) rivals like Mansions of Madness, and it ensures you'll have a blast even if you've already played an older version of the game. (To see how previous instalments stack up against the current one, check out our guide to Betrayal at House on the Hill 3rd edition vs 2nd edition.)\nYes, there's a learning curve. Its scenarios aren't always the most well-balanced either. But for the most part, you'll have enough fun that those niggles won't matter. This is perfect for game night with your grown-up friends, and it's one you can keep coming back to time and time again.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | The surprise traitor twist puts Betrayal head and shoulders above its competition, as does its randomly-generated board. | 4/5 |\nAccessibility | Because you're discovering the house as you explore, players will be eased in gently to this horror game. Some scenarios could be better-explained, though. | 3.5/5 |\nReplayability | Thanks to 50 unique scenarios and a house that's different every time you play, Betrayal will deliver for months to come. | 4.5/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Seeing as you place tiles as you go, setup for this game is incredibly straightforward. Packing it away is more of a headache, but not to any great degree. | 4/5 |\nComponent quality | Vivid artwork, a distinct style working across each component, and excellent miniatures make this one to beat in terms of quality. | 5/5 |\n\"If you're in the mood for a game you can truly sink your teeth into, Betrayal leads the pack. A randomized board and 50 unique scenarios (all with their own strategy) should keep you on edge for months, and it occupies a Goldilocks zone of gaming even if it isn't always the most balanced.

The result can eat up a full day if you let it, and few sessions last less than four hours. OK, it's a newer entry compared to other classic board games (1977's Cosmic Encounter, say). But none have lived up to its ambition before or since.\n\u2705 You want truly epic sci-fi: You're managing an entire starfaring civilization in a galaxy full of them, so scale isn't a problem here.\n\u2705 You want an unforgettable experience: For some, playing Twilight Imperium with friends across the weekend is a bucket-list dream. There aren't many board games that can match its creativity or the stories that emerge through play.\n\u274c You don't want a really, really long game: Sessions of Twilight Imperium last anywhere upward of four hours, but the average is six.\n\u274c You can't think of anyone who'd be interested in playing: If there isn't anyone you think would want to join you in this epic undertaking, the high cost of entry may not be worthwhile.\nFeatures & design: After setting up your galaxy of planets and stars on the table, players choose one of many factions with their own strengths or weaknesses. The lion-like Emirates of Hacan excel when it comes to commerce, for instance, while the Universities of Jol-Nar are best at researching new tech.\nNo matter what, your aim is simple: rule the universe. The cosmos' previous rulers have stepped aside, so now everyone's scrambling to park their bums on that throne. You achieve this by completing a variety of secret or public objectives, and the result is political intrigue on an incredible scale. That's why matches can take so long.\nIt looks the part too. Twilight Imperium is awash with classic science fiction tropes and a 'digital' overlay that makes it look as if it's been pulled from Mass Effect.\nGameplay: When all is said and done, Twilight Imperium isn't a million miles away from Game of Thrones. Subterfuge, betrayal, and vast battles are commonplace.\nWhile the rules powering these galaxy-shaking events aren't overly complex, they can have a big impact. As a case in point, attacks are rolled simultaneously. That means you can't ever guarantee how combat is going to pan out, so you must commit to a fight if you want to win. It's not just a case of rolling to see who gets a higher score, either; each ship has a specific attack value, and you'll roll a D10 for them all. Go over the threshold and you'll do damage.\nEqually, players will vote for or against new laws that can change the game's mechanics. This leads to debates where you'll try and convince others to go your way, or an opportunity to spend your valuable 'influence' points.\nAgain, the downside is how long this all takes to run. You can spend an entire day on Twilight Imperium without much trouble, so be warned if you're short on time. Oh my, is it worthwhile though.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | It's not a surprise that Twilight Imperium has lasted so long; there's nothing else quite like it in the world of tabletop. | 5/5 |\nAccessibility | Its rules are easier to understand than you might think, but this can be an overwhelming game that takes ages to complete. | 2/5 |\nReplayability | With multiple factions to play (each with their own strengths) and emergent struggles that come from player negotiation, you could play Twilight Imperium for years and not get bored. | 5/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | There are a lot of moving pieces behind Twilight Imperium, and it sprawls across a table. | 2/5 |\nComponent quality | Top-tier sci-fi artwork and incredibly high-quality components make this one of the best-made games around. | 5/5 |\n\"Twilight Imperium is the ultimate big board game. It's expensive, takes ages to play, and has a ton of rules to learn, but the reward for your efforts is one of the best board games ever made.There is a ton of strategic depth here, as each player is required to balance diplomacy, trading, economics and good old fashioned space warfare. The size and mechanical depth means it\u2019s not for everyone \u2014 I\u2019ve always described Twilight Imperium as a mixture of Risk and a meeting of the U.N.

Everyone knows about Trivial Pursuit, but I don't think it's the best board game for trivia fans. In my mind, that honor belongs to Articulate.\nFor starters, it doesn't go 'out of date' in the way its competition does. Secondly, anyone can get involved; it's something of a one-size-fits-all for get-togethers. What's more, it's ideal if you have family or friends descending on you en-masse. Up to 20 people can take part in Articulate so long as you've got even team numbers, and countless people have been enjoying the brain-teasers that follow since 1992.\n\u2705 There are a lot of players: Due to Articulate allowing for 20 people or more, it's ideal if friends or family are descending en-masse.\n\u2705 You want something anyone can play: Because it's a bit like charades, anyone can get their teeth into Articulate. You don't know lots of trivia either, because it emphasizes general knowledge.\n\u274c You want strategy: Because you're answering questions or giving out clues, there isn't much by way of strategy here.\n\u274c You don't like pressure: Whoever is offering clues has just 30 seconds to describe as many cards as they can, so it's pretty intense.\nFeatures & design: Once you've split up into teams, one member from each group will draw a card. They've then got 30 seconds to describe something listed there without using those specific words (e.g. for 'king' you might say \"man who wears a crown\"). Because you get to take another card if your teammates guess correctly, and you move that many spaces along the board once your turn is over, being succinct is key. The quicker you are, the further you'll go.\nThe space you land on will dictate which category you're reading from too, and these include everything from actions to geography. Some spaces even allow you to move your token forward or put a rival back.\nThat's probably the most interesting thing about the board, though; it's otherwise pedestrian and a bit plain.\nGameplay: The rush to rattle through as many cards as you can on your turn is, in a word, electrifying. While some won't appreciate the pressure that comes along with the spotlight, it's surprisingly engaging.\nI'll admit that the result isn't very tactical, or high-octane. Nevertheless, it is fun. The simplicity of Articulate means that anyone and everyone can get involved as well. You don't need to be the font of all knowledge either, because the categories are refreshingly broad. That also means they don't have an expiry date, unlike many trivia games.\nFinally, there are enough cards that you shouldn't get bored any time soon. I've been playing Articulate for well over a decade now and still haven't grown tired of it.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Articulate's mechanics are simple and sweet. That's probably why it continues to sell so well. | 4/5 |\nAccessibility | Everyone will be able to get involved with this game, and it's remarkably straightforward. | 5/5 |\nReplayability | Thanks to there being so many cards (each with multiple categories on them), Articulate should keep you amused for years. | 5/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | It's no trouble to lay out this game or put it away again. | 4/5 |\nComponent quality | Articulate's weakest point is its visual design.

Whenever we're looking for the best board games, our experts ask:\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66 How many players will there be?\nIt sounds obvious, but giving some thought to the number of people that'll be sitting around the table with you is crucial. Some games can only be played with two people, while others require a bigger crowd.\n\ud83d\udd50 How much time are you willing to spend?\nIt's a simple query, but will really help you zero in on the experience for you. If you lack spare time and want something quick and easy to understand, you're better off sticking with party games from companies like Big Potato or entry-level hobby games such as Catan and Carcassonne. If you're willing to dedicate more, on the other hand, I'd point you in the direction of more complex strategies such as Wingspan or Life in Reterra.\n\ud83c\udfb2 What games do you like already?\nIf you're a fan of a particular style of game, trying to find something like it is a good way forward. Enjoy the easy-going nature of Herd Mentality? Pick up Color Brain next. Are you a fan of the high-fantasy HeroQuest? Try Frosthaven, or Descent: Legends of the Dark.\n\u2753 Who are you buying for?\nIt's surprisingly helpful to think about who you'll be playing with. If you're mainly going to be going up against family or friends that don't like anything too complex, accessible 'family' titles like Ticket to Ride or Herd Mentality are going to be the way forward.\nAre you trying to find a more in-depth game to play with your board-gaming friends, on the other hand? Go in the opposite direction - avoid family-focused products and consider 'hobby' games like Betrayal at House on the Hill, Disney Villainous, or Pandemic instead.\nLongtime contributor and board game designer Katie Wickens has some advice as well. More specifically, she says that \"board gaming is all about delighting your inner child \u2013 to do that you'll need to learn its language. Start with a theme. Something that brings out that childlike wonder is really important, because it'll give you something familiar, even nostalgic, to latch onto and fuel your immersion. Then you'll need to decide if you're all about playing solo, working collaboratively with others, or crushing your enemies at every turn. Some games will deliver you solitude, while others feed the team player in you, and some will feed your will to dominate, with the latter often landing somewhere on a sliding scale of relationship-endangerment.\n\"Your gaming group's needs should factor in too. There's no point presenting Grandma with an intensely strategic Eurogame when a simple game of snakes and ladders will do. Most importantly, think about what makes your brain light up. That could be collecting and managing resources, thinking tactically to outmaneuver your opponent, or even building something beautiful \u2013 the mechanics we mention will give you an idea of whether a game will speak to you. Remember: everyone games differently, and there's something out there for everyone.\"\nHow we test the best board games\n- Our team has written more than 100 tabletop game reviews\n- We've spent years interviewing industry experts\n- We've reported on board games for over six years\n- We visit board game conventions & events each year\nThe way we test products is incredibly important to the GamesRadar+ team, and our experts (who have years of experience covering the industry) won't ever recommend anything unless they legitimately feel it's worth your time. If we don't think a product is one of the best board games, it doesn't get onto this page.\nYou can find more details in our dedicated 'how we test board games' feature, but the GamesRadar+ process involves our reviewers spending as much time playing and living with a game as possible, allowing us to go far beyond surface-level judgements. This helps them ascertain what it does well, what it fails at, and its overall longevity. We also run multiple sessions with different player counts, just to see how the experience differs.\nWhen approaching the critique on this page, we use four distinct sections described below:\n- Introduction: We discuss the 'elevator pitch' of a game (what does it do differently?) here, along with 'buy if/don't buy if' boxouts to help you decide if it's right for you at a glance.\n- Features & design: A game's basic mechanics are discussed here. We also explore its art/components in this section.\n- Gameplay: As the name would suggest, the majority of our review will focus on a game's mechanics. Is it fun? Is the core loop satisfying? Is the pacing off? We'll discuss everything we did and didn't like about gameplay here.\n- Expert verdict: We ask our experts for their opinion on the game in question, to provide an alternate take.\nWe finish each recommendation with a ratings table that covers essential elements like setup, complexity, and the good old-fashioned question of whether gameplay is fun or not. It looks something like this, and features a score out of five for every category:\nCategory | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | A breakdown of how good the game's systems are. | ? / 5 |\nAccessibility | Is the game easy to get into? We let you know here. | ? / 5 |\nReplayability | Our experts dig into the longevity of a game here. | ? / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Can you set the game up quickly, or is it a pain to put away? We'll give our verdict in this section. | ? / 5 |\nComponent quality | Are the game's pieces going to last? We'll let you know. | ? / 5 |\nFor a more in-depth examination of our process sitewide, be sure to see the GamesRadar+ review policy.\nBest board games FAQ\nWhat is the most popular board game in 2025?\nThere have been plenty of board games to snatch up fans' attention over the past few months, but one has risen to the top of the pile: Fate of the Fellowship, by Pandemic designer Matt Leacock. I've seen nothing but positive gushing about this online thanks to its clever twist on a familiar formula, and if I had to pick one board game as the most popular of 2025, it'd be this. Indeed, Leacock himself said that it was \"definitely the most thematically and mechanically rich game I\u2019ve worked on\" when we interviewed him earlier this year.\nIt's not alone, though. Earlier on in 2025, Wingspan spinoff Finspan made waves (no pun intended) too. Much like its dragon-themed predecessor that came out the year before, Finspan was unveiled by surprise and released in quick succession. Because of Wingspan's pedigree, along with an ocean-based theme fans had been asking for, that was enough to create a furore.\nCatan's new edition that is \"modernizing\" it for today's audience also got its fair share of attention at the start of the year. Seeing as Catan is one of the most influential games around, any changes to the formula are justifiably going to attract a spotlight.\nStill, these answers are all based on what the community is interested in - not necessarily in terms of sales. So far as popularity by way of bestsellers goes, family-favorites such as Connect 4 come up trumps according to Amazon's list (followed by modern classics such as Codenames and Ticket to Ride). Sure, that's not a definitive guide. But seeing as Amazon is potentially the most popular retailer in the world, it's a decent temperature check. Similarly, it's true that this doesn't account for what customers thought of the games after they played them... but it's a starting point.\nOf course, there's no way to discuss 'popular' board games without addressing the elephant (or should that be pawn?) in the room - chess. This ancient pastime has been going strong for longer than anyone can remember, and such staying power is reflected in annual sales. To be precise, chess has a habit of shifting around 3 million units each and every year. That's more than most of the best board games combined.\nWhat is the #1 board game?\nIf you want to know what the number one board game in the world is, it largely depends on what you're judging that on. If you were looking for the best board games in terms of sales, it'd almost certainly be chess. This ancient pastime sells around three million units each and every year, making everything else on the market look pretty insignificant by comparison. Monopoly follows shortly afterward with more than 200 million copies sold across its 80-year lifespan, which isn't bad going by any stretch of the imagination.\nIf we were going by ratings, however, it'd be a very different story. Take a look at popular tabletop forums and you'll often find the likes of Brass: Birmingham or RPG epic Gloomhaven ranking highly. Indeed, our team has certainly rated Gloomhaven and its smaller prequel as highly as we can thanks to their incredibly high quality. Actually, 'legacy' mechanics such as those seen in the latter (where the consequences for your actions carry over from session to session) are often a big hit with players.\nSo, what do we think? In the opinion of the GamesRadar+ team, we believe it depends on the kind of game you're looking for - the answer varies based on whether you'd like a co-op experience, strategy, or something else entirely. As luck would have it, we've listed what we think are the best board games in each category on this very page... Here's a quick rundown of the best board games in 2025:\nBest overall: Catan\nBest co-op: Pandemic\nBest for adults: Life in Reterra\nBest 2-player: Sky Team\nBest roleplaying: Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion\nBest party: Codenames\nBest strategy: Root\nBest horror: Betrayal at House on the Hill\nBest classic: Twilight Imperium\nBest for families: Ticket to Ride\nBest for kids: King of Tokyo\nBest trivia: Articulate\nWhich board games should I look forward to in 2025?\nThe tabletop gaming world never sits still, and new products are landing on shelves every single month. (It feels like there's a steady avalanche, in fact.) Because there's so much to sift through, the GamesRadar+ team and I have rounded up a few board games we're looking forward to in particular this year. If you put anything on your wishlist over the next few months, we'd suggest making it these entries.\nFate of the Fellowship | View at Asmodee\nThis Lord of the Rings adaptation has lit something of a fire under tabletop fans, and it's probably the game I've seen the most buzz about this year by a wide margin. That's because it's made by Matt Leacock, creator of the Pandemic franchise, and uses those same mechanics. Because Pandemic is a stone-cold classic, Fate of the Fellowship feels worthy of all the attention.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: July 2025\nSuper Boss Monster | View at Brotherwise\nI've had a soft spot for the Boss Monster franchise ever since my older brother brought the original card game home over a decade ago. This 'ultimate' edition combines the dungeon-building the series is known for with a larger town map, and it's backwards compatible with other Boss Monster releases. That makes it the perfect collection for longtime fans or those who've never tried it.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: Spring/Summer 2025\nViking Route | View at Kickstarter\nWe were very taken with this Viking-themed co-op game delighted us when we had a go at this year's UK Games Expo, so it went onto our wishlist immediately. You should put it on yours too, because it has an ingenious new mechanic using magnets that decides where your longhship goes next. Good forward-planning is essential as a result, providing a fresh challenge I've certainly not seen before now.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: October 2025\nTimber Town | View at Hachette\nBecause this builds on the mechanics of Life in Reterra, Carcassonne, and more, this new game can't come soon enough for the GamesRadar+ team. Your aim is to snatch up tiles as they 'float' downriver, and these are used to build a village for beavers. We singled this out as one to watch when we visited the UK Games Expo 2025.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: June-July, 2025\nHorrified: Dungeons & Dragons | View at Zatu\nI have a lot of time for the Horrified franchise, and for my money, it's comfortably one of the best co-op series out there. Although previous spin-offs focusing on American Monsters and Greek Myth were fun, this is the one I've been most excited about. I'm a massive D&D fan, and I think it has some of the best monsters in all of fantasy, so the combination is a match made in heaven.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: Halloween 2025\nGwent: The Legendary Card Game | View at Hachette\nThis adaptation of the popular Witcher card game is on its way to tabletops, and with a new Witcher following, interest is at an all-time high. We saw this in person at the UK Games Expo and came away very impressed by the head-to-head card battler.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: August 6, 2025\nBuilders of Baldur's Gate | View at Wizkids\nConsidering how in the zeitgeist Baldur's Gate is, this city-building spin-off focusing on the city is one we've got our eye on. You'll spend your time building your best version of the D&D metropolis.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: July-September 2025\nThe Witcher: Path of Destiny | View at Gamefound\nThis narrative-based game caught our eye because it's a blend of the classic short stories from Geralt's past fed through the world of CD Projekt Red's games. If you're a fan of choose-your-own or story-heavy experiences with a gritty twist, this should be on your wishlist.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: Spring 2025\nWhat are the best board games to come out in 2025 so far?\nNow that we're well over halfway through the year, 2025 has plenty of great games under its belt. Even though the US-China tariff situation has complicated things recently, that can't take away from the fantastic titles that have already landed over the past few months. Here are a few favorites of ours.\nThe Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game | View at Amazon\nThere was a lot of excited buzz surrounding this beautifully-illustrated card game earlier in 2025, and it's a novel spin on the trick taking concept thanks to co-op gameplay. I managed to see it in person at the London Toy Fair early this year and walked away impressed, so I recommend putting it on your wishlist now if it isn't already.\nFinspan | View at Amazon\nThe announcement of Wingspan's underwater spinoff took many of us by surprise, but the idea just makes sense. It takes the same mechanics and applies it to the ocean (albeit with different depths of water instead of unique habitats like its predecessor), so what's not to like? This has been pitched as a more beginner-friendly game than Wingspan or the more complex Wyrmspan, and that makes it the perfect introduction.\nDune: Imperium - Bloodlines | View at Dire Wolf Digital\nAs an expansion to the excellent Dune: Imperium Uprising, Bloodlines takes things to the next level with game-changing tech tiles and new Leaders to master. As mentioned by contributor Samantha Nelson in her review, fans should \"make it a default part of your games.\"\nAzul Duel | View at Amazon\nSeeing as puzzle classic Azul is so beloved, any two-player version was going to garner a lot of attention. This is a much more streamlined experience that caters specifically to two players, so it's perfect for travel or couples.\nEverdell Duo | View at Amazon\nEverdell is the sort of game you need a few people to get the most out of, and that's not always practical. As such, this two-player version leapt onto our radar because it condenses those concepts into a more bitesize form.\nArydia: The Paths We Dare Tread | View at Far Off Games\nHere's an enormous, open-world RPG to keep us all busy. Having been in the works for years after a successful Kickstarter, and it promises epic co-op adventures featuring 60+ pre-painted miniatures, 40+ hours of play, and around 300 map cards. Contributor Katie Wickens was full of praise for it in her review, saying that it \"manages to give everyone somethings D&D can't match.\"\nCritter Kitchen | View at Cardboard Alchemy\nWe're suckers for cozy games like this, so the spiritual successor to Flamecraft caught our attention right away. Your aim is to gather ingredients for an almighty meal your restaurant's going to make, all to impress a celebrity critic. It's a cute concept with some light but satisfying competition.\nThe Last of Us: Escape the Dark | View at Themeborne\nThis gritty, grungy spin on Escape the Dark Castle focuses on tough choices, emphasizes narrative, and shines a spotlight on teamwork. That made it an early standout of 2025, particularly thanks to that stunning monochrome art style.\nMetal Gear Solid: The Board Game | View at CMON\nIt took a very long time to get to this point, but the adaptation of Hideo Kojima's classic video game finally arrived early in 2025. It was made by the very talented designer of the stealth epic Specter Ops, so Solid Snake hasn't ever been better.\nWhere can I buy cheap board games?\nWe spend a lot of our time looking for good board game deals each week, and we've built up a list of go-to retailers that have proven to be consistently reliable. You can find these below.\nUS\n- Amazon: Best for variety\n- Target: Gets exclusive products\n- Walmart: For family classics\n- Miniature Market: For hobby games\nUK\n- Amazon: Best fovr variety\n- Magic Madhouse: Surprisingly good offers\n- Zatu: Deals on hobby games\n- Argos: Good for family games\n- Very: Family game deals\n- John Lewis: Solid deals on all kinds\nEager for more recommendations?

      "text": "The 6 best family board games for 2025, chosen and reviewed by experts\nFind budget-friendly games that everyone can enjoy here\nIf you can't take slogging through hours of Monopoly anymore, it's time to break out the best family board games. Despite what you might think, this is a vibrant and adventurous industry with modern classics that leave old-timers in the dust.\nThe trouble is knowing where to start. That's why the GamesRadar+ experts and I are on hand to recommend the best family board games here. Alongside suggestions for parties, lazy afternoons at home, and everything in-between, you'll find suggestions that'll suit all skill-levels or budgets (something that will become increasingly important if the China-US tariffs continue as planned, because publishers have suggested they could inflate the cost of board games). These must-haves get everyone involved, so even reluctant players should be happy to try them out. Oh, and don't assume they'll bore you to sleep if you're a tabletop veteran; I'd argue that they are some of the best board games overall. Take this guide's top choice, Ticket to Ride, as an example. It's very accessible but has hidden layers of strategy to keep you invested.\nTo make sure we're only discussing the best of the best when it comes to family board games, this list is made up of options our experts have had extensive hands-on experience with. If it doesn't wow the GamesRadar+ team, it doesn't get on the list\u2026 and because we review board games for families as a living, that bar is pretty high. You can find out more in the 'how we test' section further down the page. Not sure what you want, on the other hand? Check in with the 'how to choose' section for advice.\nBenjamin has spent more than six years covering board game news, reviews, and features for GamesRadar+. He has also been writing professionally since 2012. However, he began playing family board games from the moment he was able to roll dice as a child.\nMay 20, 2025: Alongside an improved 'how we test' section that more accurately reflects our process, this page has been updated with a new sections on the best family board games you should look forward to in 2025 (including Flamecraft Dual) and the best new games that arrived earlier this year (such as Flip 7).\nApril 25, 2025: This page has been updated with a new 'where to buy' section that discusses the retailers we prioritize on GamesRadar+ when looking for discounts on the best family board games.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nThere's nothing quite like Ticket to Ride. Easy to learn but spellbinding nonetheless, it challenges you to build a train line across continents. Although you can sabotage rivals by crossing their route, you don't have to - the fun lies in racking up as many points as possible. That makes the experience pretty zen on the whole. In fact, playing it helped us get through lockdown.\nRead more\nBest party\nYou won't find a better ice-breaker than this. Even though you're trying to collect eight cows (e.g. points) for your 'herd,' it's not really competitive. It's also straightforward enough to be enjoyed by all ages. That's because you'll be answering questions like \"what's the best sauce,\" and you score if you're in the majority. Seeing as it's about what you think others will say, Herd Mentality is perfect for starting conversations.\nRead more\nBest card game\nFor families with children (and even ones that are all grown-up, actually), Sushi Go is an essential purchase. Quick, straightforward, and endlessly replayable, it's the sort of thing kids can grasp quickly\u2026 but has a decent amount of strategy under the surface. Seeing as it comes in a portable tin and doesn't need much space, it's great for traveling as well; you can sling it in a bag and take it on vacation without any trouble.\nRead more\nBest strategy\nIn terms of enchanting family board games, Wingspan takes the cake. Challenging you to build the best wildlife reserve, it's oddly satisfying; you collect birds with special bonuses so that you can collect yet more birds, and so on. The lack of direct competition helps with this engrossing loop, and players will try to beat each others' scores instead. When combined with beautiful artwork, it's a real treat for older families.\nRead more\nBest trivia\nMost trivia board games go out of date before long, but not Articulate. Relying on more general knowledge instead, it's still relevant years after it was published. That means anyone can give it a go, too; you don't need to be a font of niche facts. Plus, it having such a massive player count (so long as you're divided into teams, you can have 20 or more people involved), it's ideal if relatives are descending en masse.\nRead more\nBest puzzle\nThis easy-going game has been going strong for more than 20 years, and it's not hard to see why; Carcassonne is accessible, endlessly replayable, and satisfying in equal measure. That's the reason it's often labelled as the perfect 'gateway game' for anyone hoping to graduate from Monopoly or Clue \u2013 it's a step up in complexity and tactics, but not so much that beginners will feel lost.\nRead more\nBest family board game overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNo matter whether you want to entertain the kids on a lazy Sunday or you're feeling sleepy post-Christmas dinner, the last thing you want is a complicated game that'll tax your brain. This is why Ticket to Ride is so brilliant. While there are tactics involved, it's a much more laid-back experience than other family board games on this list. It's the kind of thing you can learn in 15 minutes or less, too, so everyone will be able to join in regardless of their experience level.\nFinally, it's competitive but not to the point you'll fall out \u2013 players should still enjoy themselves even if they lose.\n\u2705 You want something easy that's still fun: If you're looking for an accessible game that won't bore you after a couple of sessions, Ticket to Ride fits the bill. Even though you can learn it in 10 - 15 minutes, it's tactical enough to keep you from checking your phone.\n\u2705 Your family is new to board games: Ticket to Ride is often dubbed a 'gateway' game because it balances accessibility with more complex mechanics than you'd find in something like Clue.\n\u274c You want a challenge: This isn't the most strategic game out there, even if it offers challenges of its own. Those looking for something to truly test their mettle will be disappointed.\n\u274c You'll play it a lot: I can say from experience that Ticket to Ride will lose its shine if you play too often. While it got my family and I through pandemic lockdown thanks to digital sessions, we eventually became over-familiar with its routes.\nFeatures & design: Ticket to Ride whisks us back more than a hundred years to a time when top hats were considered cool, and you're a businessperson hoping to earn their fortune on those new-fangled steam locomotives. Players score points by creating train routes across North America, Europe, or wherever your copy of the game is set.\nEasy enough, right? Sort of \u2013 winning isn't so straightforward. Because certain routes are worth more than others, the race is on to claim them before anyone else can.\nDifferently-colored train cards are critical for that. You need sets (ranging between two and half a dozen cards each) to place your tokens on a route, and these are drawn either from a face-up market available to everyone or blind from the deck. That means others can figure out what you're gunning for and act first if you're not careful. This gives Ticket to Ride a push-your-luck edge.\nYes, it's a little more cutthroat than you might have expected. But hey, Ticket to Ride is pretty enough for you to let it off. Even the standard version comes with 3D train tokens, and the cards provide pops of color that leap off the table. The board itself is rendered in a quaint turn-of-the-century style as well, so this board game for families has personality to spare.\nGameplay: Because everyone is scrambling to earn cards and win routes (many of which cross over with one another), Ticket to Ride draws you in by the scruff of your neck despite it being so laid back on the whole. This also makes it a satisfying personal challenge, even if you end up losing; there's something pleasing about completing a long and complicated route, especially if you have to go around a rival's line. Indeed, needing to take the long way round may be frustrating in the heat of the moment, but coming up with a workaround is rewarding.\nSpeaking of which, all that jostling for space injects an undercurrent of strategy. Which routes should you prioritize? And once you've finished your current batch, should you take any more? It's a fun conundrum to wrestle with, because failure to complete routes before the end will see those points taken off your total.\nThen there's the question of which routes you choose. Do you risk building a longer line for maximum value? Or should you finish a bunch of shorter routes to score quickly? It's a similar dilemma to Jaipur, one of the best card games, and will keep you invested for a while.\nJust be careful not to overdo it. You might learn Ticket to Ride's routes if you play it too much (thus allowing you to guess what other players are working on right away), and that robs it of some magic. Although the game got me and my extended family through the pandemic lockdown because we were able to 'play' together virtually via webcam, we did eventually become overfamiliar with Ticket to Ride so needed a break before getting it out again.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | This game doesn't overcomplicate things, and that's its greatest strength. It's easy to understand, but you still have plenty to think about during each match. | 4/5 |\nAccessibility | Ticket to Ride is blissfully straightforward, but it has slightly more to it than many family board games. | 4/5 |\nReplayability | You'll eventually learn this game's routes, and even though that doesn't sink it entirely, it does reduce the fun factor. | 3/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | There are going to be plenty of toy trains to pick up at the end, but it's generally not too taxing. | 4/5 |\nComponent quality | Quality card stock, a hard-wearing board, and plastic train icons mean that this is a very good looking game. | 5/5 |\n\"Yes, Ticket to Ride has a competitive edge. But not to the point its players fall out. Aside from an occasional gold rush over routes everyone wants, it's a refreshingly sedate puzzle you work on by yourself. There's a layer of strategy chugging away beneath all that, though. Deciding when to push your luck or play it safe gives it the compelling hook it needs, so even though it's not the most complex board game for families, there's plenty enough here to engage with.\" Read more: Ticket to Ride review\nBest family party board game\n2. Herd Mentality\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf my family is getting together and wants to play something, I'll always break out Herd Mentality first. It's the perfect board game for families that don't even like board games; it's dead easy to understand, is low-pressure, and doesn't require any kind of specialist knowledge. It won't ever become outdated, either \u2013 this one hinges on what your group thinks instead of your ability to remember obscure trivia.\nSeeing as it accommodates so many players (up to 20), it's also a solid pick if you have a particularly large clan of relatives.\n\u2705 You're looking for an easy-going, light-hearted game: It doesn't get more laid back than this, so Herd Mentality is perfect if you're hoping to kick off a games evening or need a low-effect choice. Catering to so many players is a bonus, too.\n\u2705 You're playing with people who don't usually get involved: There's absolutely no pressure to Herd Mentality, and there isn't a 'right' answer to any of its questions either. That means it's great for those who aren't a fan of being in the spotlight.\n\u274c You want something strategic: There's very little by way of strategy with this one, and the only 'tactic' you'll need is the ability to second-guess what your family might write down each round.\n\u274c You don't know the other players well: Are you hoping to make a good impression by playing this with a loved one's family that you've just met, perhaps over Christmas? You may struggle, because it's much easier if you have an idea of how everyone will answer.\nFeatures & design: Herd Mentality was designed by the company behind many of the best party board games, and that means it's wonderfully silly. Rather than posing trivia questions to make you think, it throws out bangers like \"what is the best sauce?\" You'll then scribble down your answer.\nThere's no 'right' answer, of course. Instead, you're trying to match what you think everyone else is going to say. You earn points if you're in the majority, and anyone in the minority gets penalized with the squishy pink cow of shame. This is basically a stress toy, so at least you can work through your angst if you get it.\nWhile we're on that subject, the theming is absolutely on point. Each player is trying to build their 'herd' by collecting eight cows (e.g. point tokens), and all of these are amusingly bizarre. They are also taken from a central, grassy pen rather than a boring case, so full points for effort. When combined with the fuzzy black spots on its box, Herd Mentality is more than a little quirky.\nGameplay: This is a game that can be explained in 10 seconds flat, and that's a huge bonus if you're trying to corral rowdy family-members. There's next-to-no downtime either, as everyone is writing down or sharing their answers together.\nCrucially, the fact that there's no 'correct' answer is helpful for those who don't play board games, or avoid them because they aren't sure what to do. It's also perfect if you have loved ones that are uncomfortable about joining in, or just prefer to watch \u2013 you'll find them starting to get involved from the sidelines by chipping in with what they think. My mom certainly does, and she never plays family board games with us.\nEven if everyone disagrees, that can be fun in and of itself. You'll all joke about why you're right, or discuss someone else's surprising answer. That makes it a good opportunity to learn something about each other and open up new discussions that get everyone talking.\nWhat's more, it's hugely replayable. No two groups are the same and will all answer differently. Herd Mentality is a family board game with plenty of longevity behind it as a result.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Herd Mentality is a lot of fun, and it'll fill a very happy half-hour. It isn't the deepest game, though, so more experienced players may find it too straightforward. | 3/5 |\nAccessibility | Literally anyone can play this game, and it's dead easy to learn. | 5/5 |\nReplayability | Because there's no 'right' answer (and everyone's responses will be different), Herd Mentality can be rolled out again and again without losing its shine. You may eventually get tired of the formula, but not for a while. | 4/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | All you need to get going with this one is a handful of cards, pens, and cow tokens. That makes setup a doddle, though the box's storage solutions aren't the best (I find that the pieces often come loose). | 4/5 |\nComponent quality | I'm always impressed by how sturdy Herd Mentality's tokens and 'pen' (e.g. token holder) are, not to mention that delightfully squishy pink cow. The box's velvet patches are a surprise bonus. | 5/5 |\n\"Herd Mentality manages to be exceedingly silly yet still involves a satisfying element of social strategy, especially if you know the group you\u2019re playing with well. Side note: you\u2019ve got to give props to Herd Mentality for supporting up to 20 players, this will definitely come in handy during big family-togethers.\"\nBest family card game\n3. Sushi Go!\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNo matter whether you're looking for family board games you can take with you on the go or something your kids will like, Sushi Go ticks those boxes. Besides being incredibly easy to learn, it doesn't take up much space in play or packed away. That makes it perfect for slinging in a backpack.\nIt doesn't take long to finish a match, either. Playing with younger gamers or the chronically impatient? This won't get boring\u2026 and it won't make you want to tear your hair out if little ones insist on rematch after rematch.\n\u2705 You want something quick: Because matches of Sushi Go rarely last more than 15 minutes, it doesn't outstay its welcome. It also lives in the sweet-spot so far as children's attention-spans go.\n\u2705 You want an on-the-go game: If you like to take family board games with you on vacation or out and about, Sushi Go is perfect. Besides coming in a little tin that won't take up much space, it only requires a small table to lay your cards on.\n\u274c You want a game for very young kids: Although it's very straightforward, this may still be too much for particularly young children. Planning a few goes ahead is crucial, as is adding up your score at the end.\n\u274c You want something very strategic: It requires some tactics, but this isn't an overly deep family board game. Whether that's a plus or minus depends on what you're looking for.\nFeatures & design: Sushi Go is different every time you pick it up. It works in a very similar way to Exploding Kittens, with players taking a card and passing the rest on\u2026 except here you need to build a selection of dishes that earn points over the course of three rounds. Whoever racks up the biggest score wins.\nSome of these cards are worth a lot right away, others provide multipliers, and yet more require you to collect a set for bigger payouts. This means that there are multiple approaches you can take on your path to victory. (Just don't forgot about Puddings, which are only scored at the end of the game and may tip your score over the edge.)\nThe art accompanying all this is delightful. Each dish has been given a cartoon makeover, which makes even me - someone who is notorious for avoiding seafood - want sushi.\nGameplay: The elevator pitch for Sushi Go is simple, but don't think it's shallow as a result. Because you'll be looking through your hand of cards before passing it to the next player (and can obviously tell what others have picked), smart cookies can sabotage their rivals by taking the cards someone else needs. It's deliciously devilish, and most will pick it up quickly.\nThe game's rapid-fire nature makes it a winner with little ones that don't have much patience, too. Matches don't take long and are easy to set up, so you can happily run an encore without much trouble.\nNot that this is only for kids, of course. It'll be a hit with all ages, and is a great warm-up game before moving on to something with more depth. I have many fond memories of playing this with friends or family at parties, so it usually gets thrown into my bag if a get-together is due.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | It's not a particularly complicated game, but you'll still feel invested as you gradually build a world-beating score. | 3/5 |\nAccessibility | Unlike some family board games, this one doesn't require much explanation at all \u2013 you can be playing in no time. | 5/5 |\nReplayability | Every match of Sushi Go is different because you'll always be dealing with a different hand of cards \u2013 and different priorities as a result. | 4/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Seeing as it only includes a deck of cards that are stored in a sturdy tin, Sushi Go is very easy to organize. | 5/5 |\nComponent quality | These cards feel as if they're built to last, and that storage tin should keep them safe when not in use. | 5/5 |\n\"Sushi Go is a quickfire gem that won't get boring any time soon. It's light, breezy, and charming enough to turn you into an instant fan. Plus, the fact that it doesn't have a board makes it a great travel option for gamers on the go.\"\nBest family strategy board game\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIn board gaming circles, Winspan is as close to a household name as you can get. The fact it walked away with one of the industry's most prestigious awards \u2013 the Kennerspiel des Jahres \u2013 in 2019 gives a clue as to why. With meticulously balanced mechanics that offer numerous ways to win accompanied by heaps of replayability, it's the sort of family board game you can make your own.\nBecause there isn't just one way to win, Wingspan is deceptively deep as well. It's the kind of experience you're still likely to be enjoying years from now; the extensive deck and varied card abilities encourage a wealth of strategies.\n\u2705 You enjoy asymmetric board games: Even though everyone's working on similar goals, players are able to use whatever strategy they like to get there. If that sort of freedom appeals to you, Wingspan should impress.\n\u2705 You love nature: Thanks to utterly beautiful watercolor artwork and a wealth of facts about the birds you're trying to collect, Wingspan will delight the animal lovers out there.\n\u274c Experimenting with playstyles sounds like a chore: Because there are so many approaches you can use in Wingspan, you may not get the most out of it if you don't experiment a little.\n\u274c Complex rules frustrate you: Wingspan isn't the easiest game to explain. If you're hoping for something you can pick up and play right away, steer clear.\nFeatures & design: The aim of Wingspan is to attract as many different birds to your nature reserve as possible using resources those species will like. These feathered friends may then give you special abilities that are used to attract even more birds, netting you points. Rinse and repeat for a thoroughly lovely time.\nIt's not just a scramble to the finish line, though. There are numerous ways to earn points, and each round has objectives of its own. This makes for a smart, layered experience you can properly dig into.\nThe art is equally high-quality. Watercolor paintings of each bird are just the tip of the iceberg; Wingspan also includes delightful egg tokens and a bird box dice tower to use when rolling for resources. The game may be a little more expensive than others on this list, but it feels every bit as premium as the price tag would suggest.\nGameplay: Steadily increasing tension is Wingspan's secret weapon. You get fewer actions to use each round, so even though mistakes are easily forgiven early on, players will have to be a lot more careful as the endgame draws near. You can also start to guess at your rivals' scores as time goes on thanks to shared objectives, so the excitement only builds with each turn.\nStill, it's not what I'd call stressful. Because everyone is working on their own boards, and there's a distinct lack of 'aggressive' moves to mess with another player's progress, it's not the kind of atmosphere that'll cause upset. If anything, it gives you the freedom to explore different tactics without fear of being undermined.\nIn much the same way, you won't feel thwarted by randomness here. There's an absurd amount of agency on tap because you can mix and match card effects as you see fit, allowing you to create resource-gathering engines that reward different playstyles. This ups the replayability in a big way, allowing you to revisit Wingspan for months to come without growing tired of it.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Due to a clever blend of engine-building and slowly increasing tension, Wingspan is a masterclass of design that quickly sinks its talons into you. | 5/5 |\nAccessibility | The main downside to Wingspan is learning it. This isn't a complicated game by any means, but it can be overwhelming at first. | 3/5 |\nReplayability | Thanks to its many cards and abilities, Wingspan has longevity to spare. You can play it numerous times and not have the same experience twice. | 5/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | This game isn't a headache to lay out or put away, even though everyone has their own board. However, I can see those plastic eggs getting easily lost during pack-down. | 4/5 |\nComponent quality | Although Wingspan is a little more expensive, the components reflect that with a suitably high quality. The bird feeder dice tower and plastic eggs are a very nice touch. | 5/5 |\n\"Affording varied play styles, Wingspan is a delightful game of feathered engine building. It's not the most competitive feeling game, but with steadily increasing tension, heaps of goals to weave into your strategy, and some oh-so satisfying combos this is one of the most replayable and satisfying freeform asymmetric games out there.\" Read more: Wingspan review\nBest family trivia board game\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you'd rather avoid a free-for-all around the table, Articulate is on the money. It puts you into teams and is playable with 20 or more people, making this one of the best cooperative board games for those with a big family.\nIts brand of trivia doesn't go out of date either, so Articulate can be relied upon for years to come. Because these categories are suitably broad, even the trivia-averse won't feel lost.\n\u2705 You want an accessible team game: This is an incredibly easy game to understand, and you're working in teams, so even those who aren't regular board gamers should feel at home.\n\u2705 You have lots of players: Because Articulate can be played with 20 or more people, nobody has to be left out.\n\u274c You struggle with pressure: Seeing as someone needs to be the 'teller' for each team every round, those who dislike the spotlight may be uncomfortable with this one.\n\u274c You want deep strategy: There isn't really any sense of tactics for Articulate beyond deciding what to do when you use the spinner. (Should you push opponents back a space, or go forward yourself?)\nFeatures & design: Rather than having you rattle off a stream of questions, Articulate is more like charades. After splitting into teams, a member of your group draws a card. They then have to describe whatever is listed on the card without saying those words (so anyone describing 'Washington D.C.' might yell \"capital of the USA\"). If the team guesses correctly, you move on to the next card \u2013 and so on \u2013 until 30 seconds is up. The amount you get right dictates how many spaces your team's token moves along the board. First to the finish line wins.\nWhile this is simple enough, the board adds a wrinkle to proceedings. Each space dictates which category you'll be using next (ranging from Geography to Action), and some let you either move ahead or push your rivals back a space.\nI just wish the components were as spicy. Articulate is a case of 'all work, no play' in terms of its design; everything is perfectly functional, yet bland.\nGameplay: Thanks to its simple premise and accessible rules, anyone can get involved with Articulate. You don't even have to be a trivia boffin, either \u2013 success relies on how well you can describe something, not random titbits. When combined with a broader focus (it trades topical references for something more generic that most people should be able to recognize), it's stayed relevant years after publication. This isn't a family board game that'll show its age a decade down the line.\nOK, so it won't win any awards for strategy. I wouldn't call it pulse-racing either unless you hate being in the spotlight. But that simplicity is Articulate's trump card. Everyone can get involved, no matter their age or interest. It's great as a co-op game too, because all be chiming in with suggestions on your team.\nIf you vibe with it, you'll be able to keep playing for years as well. Articulate is buried beneath cards carrying multiple words each (not to mention numerous categories), so you're unlikely to hit the same ones repeatedly. As a case in point, I've played the game since 2010 and I'm still not bored of it.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Articulate knows that 'simple' is often best, and it doesn't overcomplicate things. It's elegant, easy to understand, and will entertain for years to come. | 4/5 |\nAccessibility | This is a very straightforward game, to the point that I'm pretty sure you could have explained the rules and be playing in under a minute. | 5/5 |\nReplayability | Countless cards are included within the box, and each one has multiple categories to choose from. That means you can still be playing years from now. | 5/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | A central board with a spinner, a token for each team, and a deck of cards is as complicated as it gets. | 4/5 |\nComponent quality | This is the one area Articulate falls down, if you ask me \u2013 its visual design is simple and the components won't stand up to much punishment. | 2/5 |\n\"Perfect for revealing the true extent of the mental connection between you and your teammates (or just making a bit of a fool of yourself), Articulate offers rapid-fire fun for all the family. Its exceedingly simple gameplay loop and high level of replayability means you can expect Articulate to make a regular appearance at family board game nights.\"\nBest family puzzle board game\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCarcassonne is seen as one of the best classic board games for good reason; even though it's now available on a ton of digital platforms, there\u2019s something special about playing the game in its original, physical format that can't be beaten. Seriously, dropping a tile in exactly the right place to earn points is weirdly satisfying.\nThere are plenty of expansions to keep you busy once the core game has lost its shine, too. These add-ons include everything from castles and kings to mayors, so you should have plenty to chew on.\n\u2705 You want something short: Matches of Carcassonne rarely last longer than 30 minutes, so it's a great option if you're short on time.\n\u2705 You don't want a tactical game: If you aren't a fan of strategizing or analysing every move before you make it, the easy-going Carcassonne will appeal.\n\u274c You want something strategic: This game isn't particularly deep, so anyone that enjoys a more cerebral challenge will be left cold.\n\u274c You hate randomization: Luck of the draw plays a huge role in Carcassonne's gameplay.\nFeatures & design: Created in 2000 and inspired by the walled medieval town of the same name, Carcasonne's board is created as you play. Everyone fills out a section of Southern France using tiles drawn at random, and placing meeples \u2013 little wooden people \u2013 earns you points for each completed city, road, or connected field. It's a simple concept, and one\nRegardless of what happens, you can be guaranteed a rather handsome tapestry of tiles by the end of a match. Some may not like how the layout doesn't necessarily make sense (roads to nowhere, here we come), but it's a delightful patchwork of medieval life nonetheless.\nGameplay: Carcassonne is laid back by design, so it's a good family board game for those who want a more relaxing time around the table. That doesn't mean it's challenge-free, though. Having a strategy in mind while placing your pieces is crucial. Although luck of the draw is involved, leaving yourself enough space to finish landmarks is a challenge in itself.\nSimilarly, you can cut into a rivals' space or share control of their cities by linking your unconnected town with theirs. This ability to think on your feet and plan for possible moves keeps the game interesting. Plus, there's a lovely social element at play here because you're all contributing to the same, shared board.\nIt won't occupy strategy gamers for long, but there's something satisfying about cashing in a chain of meeples as well. Carcasonne is the kind of game where the leaderboard can shift very quickly, especially if you embrace chaos and try to sabotage other players.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | This is a phenomenally easy-going game, so even though it's not going to tax strategy aficionados, it's ideal as a casual family game. | 3/5 |\nAccessibility | You can explain Carcassonne and start playing within moments. | 5/5 |\nReplayability | It's not going to keep you entertained forever, but its randomly-drawn tiles mean that you'll always have a different experience each time. | 4/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Carcassonne starts simple with a single tile being placed, so the biggest challenge is shuffling them ahead of play. Packing away is a bit more involved because you'll have crafted an enormous cardboard mosaic, of course. | 4/5 |\nComponent quality | Thanks to sturdy cardboard tiles and economic but effective meeples, Carcassonne is built to last. | 4/5 |\n\"This map-building classic is fun for the whole family. It's a gateway game that can ease even the most reluctant board gamers into the hobby with a simple dominoes-like ruleset that's layered with fascinating area control mechanics. Definitely one for the collection.\" Read more: Carcassonne review\nHow to choose family board games\nIf you're not sure what you're in the mood for, don't worry - the GamesRadar+ team and I have some advice. We've been doing this for a long time now (I started writing about the best family board games for the site in 2018 and have played them since I was knee-high), so let us impart some hard-won wisdom that'll narrow things down.\nHere's what I tend to ask when recommending board games for families:\n\ud83c\udfc6 Are your family board gamers?\nKnowing how much experience your players have with tabletop gaming is always helpful. If they've never played anything beyond Sorry, I wouldn't break out Wingspan. Go for something light and breezy like Herd Mentality instead.\n\ud83d\udd50 How much time do you have?\nIf you can figure out how long you've got to play, you can narrow the list of candidates down significantly. Short on time? Avoid something like 7 Wonders and go for a party game like Sushi Go or Exploding Kittens instead.\n\ud83c\udfb2 What games do you already enjoy?\nHonestly, this might be one of the best ways to figure out what you want. If you hate murder mystery games, for example, something like 221B Baker Street won't appeal. Love trading games? Catan will be up your street. Pinning this down helps an awful lot.\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66 How many players are there going to be?\nI know it's obvious, but this is a good question to ask when choosing the best family board games. If there are only two or three of you, getting something like Articulate (which requires four players at minimum) won't work. Equally, you're sunk if you try and play something like Sushi Go with eight people. Every entry on this list has the player count displayed prominently up top, allowing you to find a suitable option right away.\n\ud83d\udcc6 What ages are the players?\nHere's another obvious consideration, but one you shouldn't ignore. While a game's age-rating can refer to the suitability of the content within (exactly like movies), it can also be a helpful way to judge whether young children will struggle or not from the off - it hints at complexity. I wouldn't wheel out Catan for a kindergartner, for instance.\nWant an overview of what's available, on the other hand? It's worth dropping in on our guide to the many types of board games. Besides filling you in on terms and genres that can be confusing unless you're a hobby veteran (like Eurogames), it's crammed with suggestions that could spark inspiration.\nHow we test board games for families\nHow we test board games is incredibly important to the entire GamesRadar+ team, and we won't ever suggest a product we wouldn't be happy to buy ourselves. Basically, we need to love something for it to get on this list of family board games.\nAs discussed in our guide to how we test board games, our reviewers (who have years of experience covering the industry) live and play with a game for as long as possible to get the best sense of how it works. This helps us establish whether it'll be a five-minute wonder or not as well.\nFor much the same reason, we'll always run multiple sessions with different numbers of people to get an idea of how this changes the experience - if at all.\nOur critique is then divided into four distinct sections:\n- Introduction: This is where we introduce what makes the game special in a nutshell. You'll also find an itemized 'buy if / don't buy if' breakdown here.\n- Features & design: We give you the lowdown on a game's 'elevator pitch' in this section. We then go into the basics of how it actually works, along with a judgement on its physical components.\n- Gameplay: Most of our review will focus on the actual mechanics of a game. We weigh in on what the play experience is like, whether it's fun, and things we weren't so keen on.\n- Expert verdict Because it's important to get outside opinions, this section rounds up a trusted team-member's thoughts on the family board game in bite-size format.\nYou'll also see the following standardized set of criteria throughout our reviews and buying guides - a ranking system based on gameplay, accessibility (how easy it is to understand and get into), setup and pack-down, component quality, and how replayable it is. Here's a quick example:\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | How fun are the game's core systems? | ?/5 |\nAccessibility | Is the game easy to understand and get into? | ?/5 |\nReplayability | We discuss whether the game has longevity here. | ?/5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Our writers go into the process of setting up and putting away a game in this section. | ?/5 |\nComponent quality | Are the tokens, cards, and more of a good quality? | ?/5 |\nFor more information on our process sitewide, be sure to see the GamesRadar+ GamesRadar+ review policy.\nBoard games for families FAQ\nWhat are the top 5 family board games?\nWhile there are countless family board games on offer right now, a few rise above the pack. You'll find our experts' personal favorites on this page, but here's a shortlist:\n- Ticket to Ride\n- Herd Mentality\n- Sushi Go\n- Wingspan\n- Articulate\nIt's a slightly different story if you're talking about sales, though. I've checked against different sources and my research indicates that chess, checkers, Monopoly, Scrabble, and Clue make the most money each year. Risk, Trivial Pursuit, and Battleship follow close behind them.\nAnother good metric would be the Amazon bestsellers list. In our most recent search, I was surprised to find that younger entries like Codenames topped the list. Not that I'm complaining, of course; that game is brilliant. Wingspan and Ticket to Ride (two games that actually feature on our roundup of the best family board games) make the cut too.\nWhat is the best game to play as a family?\nThere are a wealth of board games for families these days, and store shelves groan under the weight of them all. However, I'd always recommend ignoring these and trying Ticket to Ride first. It's a gentle game that doesn't require a lot of brain-power, but has enough strategy to keep you invested. It's not so competitive that you'll have everyone falling out, either - always a plus so far as I'm concerned.\nHerd Mentality is also a favorite in terms of family board games. It's easy to get into and doesn't put pressure on its players; you're all submitting your answers at once rather being put on the spot individually. This makes it ideal for those who don't like the attention that comes with certain games. At the same time, it's easy-going fun that won't leave you feeling bored.\nAre board games good for families?\nBoard games are an incredibly healthy pastime for families. As mentioned in our guide to how board games help cognitive health, they're a tremendous way to improve social skills, problem-solving, and more. In the piece mentioned above, Game to Grow founder Adam Davis told us that board games build \"frustration tolerance, working and sharing with others, logical sequencing, cognitive flexibility, imaginative thinking, and appreciating the unexpected.\"\nWhich family board games should I look forward to in 2025?\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nThis industry never stays still, and new games are always landing on shelves. It's the team and I's job to monitor these releases, so here are the ones we'd suggest keeping an eye out for.\nFlamecraft Duels | View at Kickstarter\nThere's a chance it may not arrive until next year, but at the time of writing, this two-player version of the adorable dragon game is set to launch in December 2025. Besides carrying across the cozy, cottage-core vibe of the original Flamecraft that made it so family-friendly, this is much more portable and specifically designed for a pair. That makes it a great choice for vacation.\nQuacks | View at CMYK\nFormerly known as Quacks of Quedlinburg, Quacks is a beloved family game that sits alongside other favorites like Carcassonne. It's getting a new edition soon, and that should come out toward the end of 2025. Besides a snappier name, it overhauls the art style with an eye-catching claymation effect. If you haven't tried the series yet, keep this on your radar.\nThe Sandcastles of Burgundy | View at Ravensburger\nThis one is either out now or is arriving very soon, so I think I can get away with giving it a shoutout here. As a child-friendly version of the iconic Castles of Burgundy, it's a great way of introducing kids to board gaming at large. I've actually seen this in person and was very impressed with its inviting design and straightforward gameplay.\nWhat are the best new family board games of 2025?\nWe're roughly halfway through the year, and that means an avalanche of games has dropped over the past few months. Some are better than others in our experience, so these are the ones from 2025 that the GamesRadar+ team and I would prioritize.\nFlip 7 | View at The OP\nI didn't think I would vibe with Flip 7 at first, because it's so simple. But that's the beauty of it; anyone can get involved, making it the perfect family board game. It challenges you to flip over cards without revealing the same number twice, all while mixing in ability cards and the chance to sabotage your rivals, so this comes highly recommended.\nFinspan | View at Amazon\nThe folks behind our favorite family strategy game, Wingspan, have surprised us with a new entry to the franchise for the last two years running. This time we got an ocean-themed version that takes us beneath the waves to collect different kinds of fish. Although it uses the same mechanics, it's more accessible than the other games.\nGloomies | View at Ravensburger\nI saw this very sweet-looking game earlier in the year, and it immediately captured my heart. Besides being cute as a button, it features gameplay similar to puzzle classic Azul mixed with the equally clever Mycelia. Well worth a look if you want something similar to those family board games, in other words.\nWhere can I get cheap family board games?\nThe best family board games can be expensive, especially in today's climate. That's why the GamesRadar+ team and I are always hunting down board game deals come rain or shine. Want to take up the search yourself? No problem. Here's a selection of retailers that I tend to check whenever I'm seeking out a bargain.\nUS\n- Amazon: Best for variety\n- Target: A reliable mix of classics\n- Walmart: Regular deals on favorites\n- Miniature Market: Wide range\nUK\n- Amazon: Best for general variety\n- John Lewis: Respectable selection\n- Argos: Reliable for classics\n- Very: A surprising range\n- Magic Madhouse: For hobby games\nFor more suggestions on what to play next, be sure to check out our guides to the best card games and classic board games everyone needs in their collection.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI've been writing about games in one form or another since 2012, and now manage GamesRadar+'s tabletop gaming and toy coverage. You'll find my grubby paws on everything from board game reviews to the latest Lego news."

People who are experienced with board games can pick this game up and play fluidly in just a few turns, but it can initially be overwhelming for casual players. The game is quite difficult, especially at first, but everything is tied together very well thematically and is very much less luck based than most cooperative board games; therefore, the (base) game is easier to play and win the more you play, but there are several ways to increase the difficulty once it feels too easy. Everyone playing feels important and all choices matter. Replay value is very high, and nobody I've played it with has had anything negative to say about it.\nPros:\n+ Thematically Consistent\n+ Truly 1-4 players (even single player is fun and challenging)\n+ Various difficulty levels and options for gameplay variation offer high replay value\n+ High-Quality pieces with great art\n+ Very hard to take control of other players - everyone feels important and their choices matter\nPOSSIBLE Cons:\n- Overwhelming at first (many different pieces and gameplay elements)\n- Can be difficult to teach because of the above point\n- Seemingly few 'scenarios' and 'adversaries' (but ultimately enough once you understand how they work)\n- Generally very challenging for new players even with the most simple set-up\nNeutral Points:\n~ Long play time for casual players (30-40 minutes for single player, 60+ minutes with 2 players, and easily 90-120+ minutes with 3 or 4 players, especially if playing with new players)\n~ In-box dividers/piece holders are flimsy and bulky, but box includes many resealable plastic bags for pieces\n~ Random elements are a small part of the game, but are very predictable, fit with the theme, and don't feel 'luck-based'\n~ NOT kid friendly. Don't be fooled by the colourful art - This game is challenging and complex for many adults, and I wouldn't even want to try playing it with anyone younger than a board game savvy 13 year old (I'm thinking of my younger siblings and cousins around that age as examples: some are definitely able to play and some I wouldn't let touch the box)\nThings to keep in mind when first playing the game:\n* If you can, learn the game with 2 players first, with the rule book and online FAQ open - learning with a single player will likely result in a quick and brutal loss that won't teach you enough, and learning with more than 2 players will likely result in a jumbled mess which will take far too long. Playing with several people is much easier when at least one person already knows how to play.\n* USE THE 'EASY' CHARACTERS - Seriously, their rules and powers are much easier to manage, and you can eliminate the deck building portion of the game as you learn the more integral elements\n* Don't be discouraged by the difficulty of the game. This game is hard to beat at first. Once you learn some strategy through trial and error, victory is much easier (which is why scenarios, adversaries, and blighted island cards are in the game, all of which increase the difficulty and/or complexity)\n-\nDr. DGranskad i USA den 15 juli 2022\n5,0 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor A Solo and Co-op Masterpiece Par Excellence\nStil: BasVerifierat k\u00f6pFrom Settlers of Catan to Puerto Rico, there are tons of prominent board games that feature an island being civilized by invading forces. Greater Than Games wanted to ask the question, \u201cWhat if the island fought back?\u201d To answer that question, let\u2019s get to the review!\nOVERVIEW: You play Spirit Island on a board made up of one map per player. Each map is seeded with enemy settlements and allied Dahan natives. Players take their turns simultaneously, beginning by choosing one of their spirit\u2019s growth options which will place presence on the board to allow them to use powers. Doing this lets players often increase either their energy income or the number of cards they can play per turn. They will then select the power cards that they will play for the turn, paying their cost (if any). Some cards are fast and will activate immediately. The invaders then take their turn ravaging some land types, defeating any Dahan there, and blighting the land. They will then build new settlements and other land types, and then send out explorers to repeat the process. The players then resolve any slow powers they played for the turn and discard all cards used for the turn. If the players can defeat enough of the invaders before too much of the land is blighted, they win.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: FOCUSED SIMULTANEOUS PLAY. Because each player begins on their own separate board with limited range on their powers, they can generally focus on the problems facing them on their map. This reduces analysis-paralysis and speeds up the game. But as the game progresses, players will be able to extend their presence to their neighbor\u2019s maps, which slowly ratchets up the cooperation and creates more of a tactical puzzle as the game goes on.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: FEAR EFFECTS. Players have a pool of fear tokens. As settlements are defeated and card effects are resolved, the tokens are moved down to the \u201cgenerated fear\u201d section. When all of the fear has been earned, the tokens are moved up and one fear card is moved down, waiting to be activated later in the turn. When 3 fear cards have been earned, the terror level for the game increases. Increasing the terror level makes both the victory conditions for the game easier and also levels up the powers of the fear cards you earned. The fear cards themselves are a lot of fun. Since you never know what effect they have, they give you random boosts to your strategy.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: TACTICAL PUZZLE. The tactical richness of Spirit Island really is unparalleled. The invader actions are telegraphed multiple turns in advance, giving you time to defeat them. The tactical puzzle gets even more interesting with the use of fast and slow powers. Trying to coordinate how to best use your powers to address the telegraphed invader actions makes this one of the best tactical puzzles in co-op board gaming history.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: VALUE AND VARIETY. Spirit Island comes with 4 scenarios that drastically change the rules of the game. It also comes with 3 different European adversaries for you to face. Each adversary has unique abilities and step-by-step upgrades to provide the exact challenge you want. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, you can even flip the game boards over to get a more challenging but more geographically realistic alternate board setup. All of this gives Spirit Island immense replay value and allows players to adjust the difficulty to the exact level they need.\nPRO, 5 out of 5: SPIRIT DIFFERENTIATION. Each spirit has unique setup rules, abilities, growth and power options, innate powers if they get combos from certain cards, and an entirely unique set of 4 power cards that only they can use. It\u2019s a staggering amount of differentiation, and the game really feels almost completely different each time. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned the ridiculous variety of minor and major powers that you can upgrade your spirit with throughout the game. This can culminate into ridiculous superpowers like lightning bearing down on the land or floods to wash enemy cities away. The variety in how your spirit will play game to game is truly spectacular.\nOVERALL SCORE, a resounding 5 out of 5. Spirit Island is absolutely one of my top co-op games of all time. I just love this game. Both serious and casual players that I\u2019ve introduced the game to have loved it as well. The combination of incredible variety, fast gameplay, and deep tactical puzzles is amazing. To keep my thoughts brief, Spirit Island is a co-op that every gamer should have in their collection. As a side note, the expansion \u201cBranch & Claw\u201d adds a ton of content to the game. I honestly don\u2019t play the game anymore without it. It should also come as no surprise that Spirit Island is excellent when played solo. When I play with just one spirit, I can complete a game in about 30 minutes, which is an amazing amount of gameplay for such a short time invested. Adding in a second spirit makes the puzzle that much tougher and exciting. All of my previous recommendations hold for people who want to play Spirit Island solo. It is GREAT.\nHappy gaming!

      "text": "The 6 best 2-player board games in 2025, hand-picked by experts\nGet ready for date night or a quiet evening in with recommendations tested by the GamesRadar+ team\nDespite what you might think, the best 2-player board games aren't a consolation prize if you can't rustle up enough people; they're perfect for everything from date night to vacation entertainment. Regardless of the season, you can't beat cozying up with board games for 2 players.\nEven if you have a regular gaming group, I'd still recommend adding some board games for 2 players to your collection. If you ask me, they're some of the best board games around. (Villainous is a particular favorite of mine, because some depth is lost with the chaos of extra people.) That's why the GamesRadar+ team and I have rounded up some recommendations here to save you time, like this month's number 1 choice - the excellent Sky Team. You'll find options to suit most moods, skill-levels, and budgets below, along with advice on how to choose the best 2-player board games for you.\nNo matter what you're in the mood for, know that our writers and editors have been hands-on with every single entry listed throughout this guide (I've got many of them in my own collection, for example).

Sky Team is the holy grail of 2-player board games; it's a magnificent blend of cooperative problem-solving with impressive replayability, and the game is small enough to take with you on the go. That's a killer combo. Seeing as it's designed with two people in mind rather than a crowd, you won't feel like you're missing out when playing as a couple either.\nHonestly, it's no surprise that Sky Team walked away with a prestigious Spiel des Jahres award. This is a winning mix that shows off how great two-player board games can be.\n\u2705 You want a game with high replayability: Due to its many scenarios and fresh mechanics that are introduced steadily over time, Sky Team isn't a five-minute novelty.\n\u2705 You want a game you can get invested in: Because Sky Team demands good teamwork thanks to its limited communication, it's impossible not to feel engaged from the start.\n\u274c You aren't keen on limited-communication games: Sky Team relies on players not being able to talk or reveal numbers once the dice are rolled (you need to communicate in other ways), so it may rub those who like to chat up the wrong way.\n\u274c You're scared of flying: A 2-player board game about landing planes and trying not to crash probably isn't a good fit for those who hate flying.\nFeatures & design: Think you could land a plane? This game puts that to the test by stuffing you into a tabletop cockpit. You and your co-pilot's aim is to touch down safely at airports around the world, and each location offers a unique problem to overcome.\nThese conundrums aren't limited to the runway, of course. As a limited-communication game, Sky Team forces you to get creative. That's because dice are used to set your speed, angle of approach, and more, but you can't talk once these are rolled. You've got no idea what your teammate is working with as a result, and seeing as you'll have to choose one of those numbers to combine or divide from the other player's die, things could get sticky fast if you don't come up with a system.\nWith all this aeronautical talk, it's fitting that the game's boards are modeled after a plane's instruments \u2013 it certainly looks the part. These are joined by classy wooden tokens to place on its various slots and a screen to hide your dice rolls from each other.\nGameplay: Players aren't allowed to chat once those dice have been let loose, so you're drawn into Sky Team by the collar. It's hard not to feel invested when you misread the situation and things go hilariously wrong.\nThis can be stressful, yes, but it also makes you feel engaged from the get-go. The game is an excellent bonding experience due that fact.\nIt doesn't lose its shine after a few goes, either. You'll have to navigate everything from other planes getting in the way to training interns, and a variety of scenarios give you plenty to chew on long-term. While these do increase the difficulty level (quite steeply in some cases), there are perks you can use to rebalance the scales. Just rolled a bad die, for example? Use a reroll token or grab a coffee powerup to adjust that number up or down. Deciding when to change your roll like this or let it be is key to Sky Team's strategy.\nWhat follows is a truly excellent board game for 2 players, and one of the few that'll help you feel closer by the end. Teamwork makes the dream work, after all.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Unlike so many competitors, Sky Team is specifically designed with two people in mind. It also makes great use of a simple yet engrossing system where you can't openly communicate with each other. Besides drawing you in, it provides a good hook to hang other mechanics off. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | The core idea powering Sky Team is straightforward, so it doesn't take long to absorb. It's also smart about drip-feeding new mechanics over time rather than all at once. | 4 / 5 |\nReplayability | There are numerous scenarios to work through in this game, and your fortunes can be influenced by the dice you roll, so it's not going to be in danger of becoming over-familiar anytime soon. | 4 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | I wouldn't say this is the perfect travel game (it still requires a table), but it doesn't take up loads of room on the whole. That makes it easy to set up and pack down. | 4 / 5 |\nComponent quality | Thanks to a board modelled after cockpit displays and a player area made to look like an aircraft safety leaflet, Sky Team has a great design. Sturdy little tokens then nudge it from 'good' to 'great' territory. | 4 / 5 |\nAs our reviewer Samantha mentioned in her critique, \"Sky Team is one of the best two player experiences out there. It\u2019s quick to play but provides a massive amount of replayability thanks to a huge variety of scenarios with slowly escalating rule complexity.\" Read more: Sky Team review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nA trendsetter\nFew are able to match this one's reputation, and it kick-started the trend of slimming down classic games for a head-to-head version. It manages to distill everything great about 7 Wonders' strategic brilliance into a smaller, more focused package.\nHead-to-head\nThis classic game is a little like bug chess; you play as opposing swarms trying to capture your foe's queen bee. Each of the five available insect types moves differently, and they're represented by very tactile (and portable) tiles you can take anywhere.\nBest mysteries\nThis deeply intelligent game is worthy of London's great detective himself, and even though playing as a pair reduces the number of brains to crack a problem, it makes solving the carefully crafted narrative much more satisfying.\nBest card game for 2 players\n2. Jaipur\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nJaipur is the poster child in terms of good board games for 2 players. Even though it's the definition of 'accessible', there's a hidden depth beneath the surface that allows you to experiment along the way. It's delightfully moreish too, making it a contender for any 'best' list.\nSo far as I'm concerned, it's one of the best card games overall.\n\u2705 You want something very replayable: There's no 'right' or 'wrong' way to play Jaipur, so you've got room to experiment every time you sit down at the table. When combined with the game's easy setup and quickfire nature, it's supremely replayable.\n\u2705 You want a good travel game: Jaipur doesn't take up much real-estate in play or when packed away, so it's a great choice if you want to game on the go.\n\u274c You want a multiplayer game: Sadly, Jaipur can only be played as a pair \u2013 there's no way to add more people into the mix. (Trust me, I've tried.)\n\u274c You want a complex strategy game: Despite having more than enough strategy to be going on with, Jaipur may not fit if you want something crunchy - it's fairly lighthearted.\nFeatures & design: Putting you in the shoes of a trader from Jaipur city, you've been challenged to become the best businessperson and earn an invite to the maharajah's court. (In other words, collect as many points as possible.) How you get there is up to you, though; players have room to test a variety of different strategies, and there are no wrong answers. Should you buy and trade cheap items quickly, or is it better to chase expensive goods that get you a larger payout in the end? You'll have to decide quickly, because the sooner you trade an item, the more points you'll get. That means your foe could beat you to the punch if you don't cash in your wares fast enough.\nSo far as its visual design goes, Jaipur is a riot of sumptuous color that brings the vibe of a busy street market to life. Its tokens are chunky bits of cardboard as well, so they should last for a good while without becoming too dog-eared.\nGameplay: Every match of Jaipur is a balancing act. The question of whether you should sell fast or hold out for a bigger payday is captivating, because there's always the risk that your opponent will get there first. They may figure out what you're collecting and go for the same thing to stop you in your tracks, too. It's surprisingly thoughtful \u2013 more so than you'd expect from a quick and seemingly lighthearted game.\nWhile we're on the subject of 'quick,' that makes Jaipur ideal for traveling as well (along with the fact that it doesn't take up much space in play or packed away). It's a shame that you can't play with more than one other person, but seeing as the experience is so laser-focused as a result, that's no bad thing.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Jaipur is another game specifically designed for two people, and it's laser-focused on providing a good head-to-head challenge as a result. Its trading system is straightforward yet surprisingly versatile as well. | 4 / 5 |\nAccessibility | Due to its simple but effective trading mechanics, you won't struggle to get the hang of Jaipur. | 4 / 5 |\nReplayability | While it lacks a deeper complexity than other games on this list, its core loop leads to a different experience every time you play. | 4 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Jaipur is easy to get ready and doesn't take up much space at all, so your most complicated job will be shuffling the deck. | 5 / 5 |\nComponent quality | That brightly-colored cardboard box may get battered if you take Jaipur on the go with you, but it's hard to fault anything else. The vibrant card artwork does a great job of evoking the open-air markets this game is inspired by, for instance. | 4 / 5 |\n\"There's no dead weight to Jaipur, and it's a great example of how to do a lot with relatively simple mechanics. Quick, compelling, and the perfect size for taking with you on the go, this is an easy (not to mention affordable) recommendation.\"\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nBest competitive\nThis has been the trading card game for the past three decades thanks to a compellingly versatile system that you can spend years mastering. It's very customizable as well, so no two people's decks have to be the same.\nFor adults\nThis is a stylish, frenetic game that combines puzzle-based attack and defence with an exquisite theme. Appropriately for a post-apocalyptic game, laying cards down results in a mushroom cloud of possibilities.\nFor all ages\nIf you want a more entry-level TCG or are shopping for a younger gamer, this stone-cold classic is the way to go. It's incredibly accessible but boasts a surprising degree of depth that has kept it in the limelight since the '90s.\nBest strategy board game for 2 players\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhat happens if evil wins? You get to find out with Villainous. Allowing players to mess around in a Disney-themed toy box, it's all about giving baddies their happy ending... and screwing over anyone that tries to stop you. Crucially, playing it as a head-to-head board game for 2 players is better than battling it out as a group. In all my years with Villainous, I've found that playing with just one other person makes for a more focused and enjoyable experience.\n\u2705 You're looking for a game you can learn and play together long-term: Every character has a unique play-style, so Villainous is the sort of game that gets better with each match. Because facing different villains encourages all-new strategies, it's very replayable as well.\n\u2705 You're a big Disney fan: As you can probably tell, this is a love-letter to Disney films both new and old. If you adore the House of Mouse, there's plenty for you to appreciate here.\n\u274c You're expecting something for families or kids: Even though it adapts some of the most beloved family films of all time, Villainous is tactical enough that casual players could bounce off it. Younger children will struggle too.\n\u274c You don't have patience for complex rules: Villainous is relatively complicated, so it's not going to be for you if strategy isn't your jam.\nFeatures & design: Don't be fooled by the colorful theming that makes it look like one of the best family board games \u2013 Villainous is hiding layer upon layer of strategy under its gorgeous artwork. You see, characters have a unique objective and play-style inspired by their movie, and that means they all handle differently from one another. They also come with their own board to explore at your leisure. However, that's not to say it's laissez-faire. The game encourages you to explore your wicked side, and you can send heroes to harass your foes as a result.\nJust be warned: it takes a hot minute to get your head around the rules, and it's not the easiest to explain.\nStill, at least you'll have time to admire its gorgeous artwork while you figure things out. Luxurious, atmospheric paintings are used here rather than screenshots from the movies in question, and every component has a premium feel that makes Villainous seem much more expensive than it is. Those movers are incredible, too; they're abstract, statue-esque representations of characters that really are beautiful.\nGameplay: While Villainous shines when played in a group, tackling it as a pair gives you space to learn the characters' ins and outs rather than being swept up by the chaos of a larger melee. And make no mistake, 'chaos' is the right word. That title isn't just a name; it's a mindset you'll need to embrace. The quickest path to victory is throwing a wrench into another player's schemes, and more people means more carnage. That's no bad thing, of course, but it's a little less focused. Seeing as genuine skill is rewarded here, battling head-to-head feels more tactical. There aren't as many variables to consider, so you can really hone in on your villain's skills.\nBecause each of these baddies is so distinctive mechanically speaking, this is the sort of game that benefits from repeat play as well. It'll take you a match or two to understand how they work, and different match-ups provide all-new challenges. (Especially if you add the many Disney Villainous expansions.)\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Villainous is the kind of game that feels richer every time you play it. This is all thanks to its best-in-class asymmetric gameplay where every character has their own unique playstyle and objective. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | It'll take a couple of goes to get used to Villainous, and that's the biggest complaint I have about it. Indeed, the publisher has since released toned-down beginner versions to better ease players in. | 2 / 5 |\nReplayability | Because each character handles so differently (and thus will interact differently with one another), Villainous is the sort of game you can keep coming back to for years. | 5 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Every player has their own board, cards, and tokens to worry about, so even though there isn't an overabundance of 'stuff,' it's still more involved than other games. | 3 / 5 |\nComponent quality | Alongside premium build-quality, the original artwork and token design here is peerless. This is how it's done. | 5 / 5 |\n\"So long as you have the patience to learn its rules, you'll be left with a smart and engaging 2-player board game that should keep you busy for a long time.\" Read more: Disney Villainous review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nNew horizons\nCivilization has come to an end in this city-(re)building board game, but that's OK; you're here to make a better one. It's a solid option for those who don't want anything too complex, and works just as well as a head-to-head.\nBest sci-fi\nThis sci-fi game was one of the most anticipated releases in 2024, and it doesn't take long to find out why. A compelling card-based system adds a fresh spin to the formula, and its many characters make it deeply replayable.\nClever stuff\nWant to give your gray matter something to puzzle over? This adaptation will do the trick. Its blend of worker-placement and subterfuge is unparalleled, and even though it's not as good 2-player, you'll still have a good time here.\nBest RPG board game for 2 players\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you grew up drawing fantasy maps and often dreamed about heroic quests, this 2-player board game will feel like those memories distilled into cardboard. With an expansive world and heroes you can make your own through upgrades, it fosters a feeling of genuine adventure from the start.\nIt's far more beginner-friendly than the original Gloomhaven, too. Despite being a lot cheaper, easier to store, and more bitesize than its predecessor, Jaws of the Lion still offers the same highs.\n\u2705 You want a swords-n-sorcery game: Jaws of the Lion has you dungeon-delving across the land, so it should be what you're looking for if you want some classic fantasy.\n\u2705 You want your choices to matter: This game puts a lot of emphasis on your decisions; you can choose how the story develops and mold your character with numerous upgrades.\n\u274c You want something simple: Gloomhaven's strength is also its downfall. Because it's a lot deeper than most games, it's a lot more complicated too.\n\u274c You're expecting it to be as deep as standard Gloomhaven: This is a prequel to the original Gloomhaven that was designed to be an accessible entry-point for newcomers. That means it's not as big or fiendish as its predecessor.\nFeatures & design: As well as being a classic dungeon-crawler where you trawl locations for loot, Jaws of the Lion reacts to your choices. Thanks to a branching storyline, the kingdom will respond to decisions you make. This is tracked through stickers on a map that's permanently altered by your journey, and secret mechanics (such as new characters) are unlocked along the way. When you add a combat system that relies on cards and strategy rather than luck of dice, it offers a feeling of agency matched only by the best tabletop RPGs.\nMuch like its predecessor, Gloomhaven, this game is also a handsome beast. If anything, it's better-looking. The map is more lavish, and instead of individual board pieces that make up most of the older game's box, you play on printed environments in a scenario book. There are those who will turn their nose up at this, which is fair enough, but the simple fact is that it's easier.\nJaws of the Lion's various tokens and trackers are made in exactly the same style as OG Gloomhaven, though. Similarly, it employs the same kind of cardboard standees for monsters (complete with moody artwork of each one) and plastic miniatures for heroes. These models might not be as high-quality as those seen in the Descent series or Bardsung, but they're still effective and evocative nonetheless.\nGameplay: While there is a learning curve you'll need to work through (Jaws of the Lion's deeper than most board games for 2 players), the payoff is greater as a result. The world of Gloomhaven is one you can lose yourself in, and you'll become very attached to your character by the end because you've spent hours leveling them up. Mix in combat that rewards genuine skill and you have a potent mix on your hands.\nAlright, so you can technically play with up to four people. Tackling it as a pair allows you to take more ownership of the narrative, though. (It's less hassle to line up schedules for the next session as well.) And yes, full-fat Gloomhaven is better overall. But this version is more intimate by default thanks to its reduced size, which makes it a great fit for two players.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | The creator of Gloomhaven hated how many RPG mechanics relied on luck or dice rolls, so they opted for a card system that is entirely skill-based. That gives players more freedom, which pairs well with the branching storyline and ongoing 'Legacy' campaign. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | While it's far more accessible than the original Gloomhaven (this was pitched as an entry point to the franchise), Jaws of the Lion is still more complex than your average game. | 3 / 5 |\nReplayability | This RPG leans hard into its Legacy roots where the consequences of your actions follow you across an ongoing campaign, so it's not something you can revisit easily unless you start over or use non-permanent stickers (which are sold separately). | 3 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Jaws of the Lion is a chunky game with a jam-packed box to sort through, but it's so much more manageable than the first Gloomhaven \u2013 largely thanks to a campaign book that removes the need for board tiles. | 3 / 5 |\nComponent quality | If you want an example of how to make a classy, high-quality board game that feels worth every cent, this is it. | 5 / 5 |\nDuring her full write-up on the game, Abigail noted that \"it\u2019s a great middleground for those who have a burgeoning appetite for more complex, involved board game experiences but aren\u2019t ready to sacrifice an entire row of their bookshelf (and a whole lot of time).\" Read more: Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion review\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nImmersive story\nIf you're playing as a pair, this RPG is a must-see. Descent blends its easy-to-use app with in-person gameplay for an experience that works brilliantly with two people \u2013 dialogue choices are involved, so you have more say over how the story progresses.\nTop-tier RPG\nAlthough Jaws of the Lion is a fantastic entry point to this series, the original can't be beaten for scale or ambition. There's a reason why it caused such a stir when it launched back in 2017; it demonstrates everything that tabletop games can be.\nGrim & gritty\nThis is another sprawling game that'll take months to finish, but the effort is worthwhile. Thanks to the gritty setting and a focus on monster-hunting, it has flavor all its own. It's also best when played with two people because adding more balloons the runtime.\nBest co-op board game for 2 players\n5. Jurassic World: The Legacy of Isla Nublar\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThink you can handle Jurassic Park better than its creators? The Legacy of Isla Nublar lets you have a go. Along with tense gameplay and consequence-driven mechanics, it improves on the 'Legacy' format (where decisions follow you from session to session) by providing something so much more replayable than its peers. Plus, tackling it as a pair gives you greater control of the choices you'll be asked to make \u2013 there's a danger of 'too many cooks' otherwise.\n\u2705 You're tired of competitiveness at the table: Teamwork is essential in The Legacy of Isla Nublar, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to show it off \u2013 be it by herding dinosaurs, solving puzzles, or deciding where you'll place your park's facilities.\n\u2705 You want a game that's always evolving: Alongside an edge-of-your-seat experience where you're racing against the clock, this game offers lasting consequences; you'll create your own board and dinosaurs.\n\u274c You can't commit to multiple sessions: Seeing as it'll take weeks for you to finish this game in its entirety, I'd steer clear if you're short on time.\n\u274c You don't like the pressure of permanently changing your board: Because the barriers and buildings you'll be placing are stickers, you can't change your mind about where they should go once they're down.\nFeatures & design: Although it allows you to play through the events of each movie, this game also fills in gaps between them with new stories. Naturally, dinos running amuck is a given\u2026 so you've got to keep them in line.\nThat's easier said than done. Aside from trying to break through any barriers you've erected, they'll do their best to chow down on park guests as well. Seeing as you have other objectives you need to complete at the same time (which feature unique mini-games), you'll often be faced with a deliciously wicked Catch 22.\nThe visual design of this 2-player board game is much easier to judge, though. In a word, it's amazing. It opts for a vibrant approach rather than slavish realism, and its rulebooks \u2013 not to mention cards \u2013 are made to look like pulp comic books. 'Wood-trimmed' elements and a colorful board give it an air of the best classic board games from decades ago, too.\nThen there are those dinosaur tokens, along with the dice. Oh my. The latter includes a d20 made to look like prehistoric mosquitos in amber, and the former are amazing little dioramas I'd be happy to display on my shelf. Legacy of Isla Nublar is an expensive game, yes, but goodness me does it make up for that.\nGameplay: Board games are at their best when something unexpected happens, and this is the perfect case in point. I once had to help geriatric park founder John Hammond fend off a T-Rex with nothing more than a cattle prod while he was stocking the gift shop, for instance. Emergent moments like this make The Legacy of Isla Nublar so much more memorable.\nThe real fun begins when you create your own board, though. Every barrier and building is permanent, so you'll wind up with a totally unique map by the end of your campaign. It isn't useless after that, either; the board can then be used in a separate, endlessly replayable game mode. There aren't many other Legacy games which give you the same luxury.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Legacy of Isla Nublar feels like a grab-bag of board gaming's best ideas, in a good way \u2013 it takes inspiration from Pandemic, Horrified, and more for a gripping co-op experience. | 5 / 5 |\nAccessibility | As a Legacy game, this will require a bit more brain-power than many other games on your shelf \u2013 but it's not nearly as intimidating as it might first appear. | 3 / 5 |\nReplayability | Unlike the majority of Legacy games, this one comes with an end-state that you can replay over and over again once you've finished the campaign. | 4 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | With so many sealed envelopes, mini boards, tokens, and cards, there's quite a lot to grapple with here. | 3 / 5 |\nComponent quality | It's very clear that no expense was spared when it comes to this game's components \u2013 it looks incredible and is built to last. | 5 / 5 |\n\"This spin on Jurassic World may lean on ideas we've seen before (hidden mechanics and branching character upgrades, namely), but thanks to a wealth of extras scattered throughout the campaign gives it a flavor all its own. Hold onto your butts, because few cooperative board games can match it.\"\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nLasting legacy\nThe Pandemic series is one of the most acclaimed board games around, and this 'Legacy' version (where you actions have long-lasting consequences) is a superb upgrade from the original. Playing as a pair gives you more autonomy.\nShort & sweet\nIf you're a fan of Pandemic, you'll enjoy this clever system. Challenging you to retrieve treasure before the island sinks beneath the waves, it's a tense race against time that will have you on the edge of your seat.\nModern classic\nDespite being an ode to classic horror, there's a lot of fun to be had here. It's a master of the trolley problem; completing your objective may mean sacrificing civilians, and with just two players this conundrum is even more keenly felt.\nBest puzzle board game for 2 players\n6. Patchwork\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere's something soothing about this 2-player board game. A serene exercise in fitting Tetris-like tiles together, it's the sort of easy-going distraction that's perfect for date night or a lazy Sunday afternoon. It's not overly competitive either, so fallings-out will be kept to a minimum.\n\u2705 You want a satisfying puzzle to solve: Despite being a competition, you're working on your own quilt pattern in Patchwork. That means you're free to figure out how you want all those pieces to fit together yourself.\n\u2705 You don't want anything too complex: The setup for this game may seem like a headache, but it really isn't. Patchwork is thoroughly chilled-out and perfect for a relaxed date night.\n\u274c You want sophisticated tactics: This is very light-touch when it comes to strategy, so anyone hankering after something complex should look elsewhere.\n\u274c You want a game for lots of people: Because Patchwork is limited to two players, you won't be able to add more people to the mix.\nFeatures & design: Your aim is simple \u2013 build a quilt before you run out of time. Fortunately, that process is much easier in Patchwork than it would be in real life. Players use buttons to 'buy' patches that slot onto their board, and this might earn them buttons in return. They can then buy more patches that earn them even more buttons. It's a satisfying domino effect, and whoever collects the most buttons at the end will win.\nJust keep an eye on the proverbial clock. Rather than using a sand timer, Patchwork tracks time by shuffling you along a central board. The bigger the patch, the more spaces you'll move. Reach the middle and it's all over.\nPatchwork is equally meat-and-potatoes in how it looks. That isn't to say it's bad; on the contrary, it's very effective despite that simplicity. The components are sturdy and well-made, while its art style is a cute but bold mish-mash of clashing patterns. Fitting for a board game about quilts, in other words.\nMeanwhile, its tokens are effective if workmanlike. They don't need to do more than they are, but a bit of flair wouldn't have gone amiss.\nGameplay: Despite what you might think, this isn't a simple race to the finish. Seeing as more desirable patches run down your time the most, planning ahead is vital \u2013 splashing out on a lucrative tile now might limit what you can do later.\nStill, you'll lose points if you leave spaces on your quilt unfilled. The result is an engrossing push-and-pull that draws you in quickly, and you won't want to put Patchwork down once you've got a taste for its smart yet simple gameplay. While it's a shame that you can't add more people to proceedings, it's a good chill-out option because it's not overly taxing.\nCriteria | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | Patchwork's greatest strength lies in how satisfying it is to slot its pieces onto your board \u2013 which becomes more unwieldy the further you go. It's not a particularly strategic experience, but it is fun. | 3 / 5 |\nAccessibility | Most of Patchwork involves you spending buttons on pieces you've then got to fit on your board, so it's very approachable. | 4 / 5 |\nReplayability | There are enough possible combinations here that you're unlikely to have the same experience twice. | 4 / 5 |\nSetup and pack-down | Every Patchwork piece must be set up in a great ring around the central board, and this is more of a faff than you'd think. Still, it's easy to pack away at the end once these have been used up. | 3 / 5 |\nComponent quality | Seeing as this game's pieces will be manhandled a lot, it's a good thing they're so well-made. There are a couple of areas where the developers could have pushed the boat out (by featuring real buttons, for instance), but that's not to say what's here is lacking \u2013 far from it. | 4 / 5 |\n\"It may not be the deepest board game for 2 players, and it won't win awards for its strategic brilliance. But it excels in every other respect. If you want to kick back and relax or are looking for a new date night favorite, Patchwork should be on your radar. Even though it only came out a few years ago, I can already see it becoming one of the best classic board games.\"\nLoad honorable mentions \u2193\nHonorable mentions\nA must-have\nIt may seem simplistic at first glance, but there's a lot of strategy bubbling under Azul's surface.

To point you in the right direction, here are a few questions that always help me when I'm looking for 2-player board games.\nIf you're still left feeling cold, why not take a look at our guide to the many types of board games? That may spark some inspiration for you.\n\ud83d\udd50 How much time do you have?\nIt's always worth thinking about how much time you've got (or are willing to spend on) board games, because that'll thin the herd an awful lot. Not keen to be sat at the table for hours on end? You'll probably want to avoid campaign games like Gloomhaven or Legacy of Isla Nublar. I've listed how long each game lasts per session in the specs of every entry, and you can usually find an average playtime on the box as well.\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66 Do you want a game that can scale up?\nWhile this guide is all about board games for 2 players, it can be nice to rope others into the action. If you want the option to add friends or family as and when you get an opportunity, be sure to look at the recommended player-count on the box (or in the 'specs' section of each entry on this page). That'll narrow things down for you.\n\ud83c\udfb2 What games do you already enjoy?\nIt sounds silly, but this simple question will help you more than any other piece of advice I could give. Our reviews always feature a 'play if you like' list, and you'll find the same thing on this page under every entry. Even if that fails, have a think about the kind of games you enjoy. That way, you can zero in on others within the genre. Love city building or area control games? Great \u2013 now you've got somewhere to start.\nFor a broader perspective, I also asked the team at Modiphius (who are responsible for an array of Fallout, Star Trek, and Elder Scrolls board games) what they thought when I caught up with them about their Discworld RPG. They said that playing a wide range of games can really help hone in on what you like; to be precise, it's \"vibes all the way down... play (or watch, or read) a bunch of games. It\u2019s the easiest way to figure out what you like and what you don\u2019t. Eventually you\u2019ll find something that makes your serotonin receptors light up.\"\nHow we test 2-player board games\n- We've been reporting on board games for years\n- We've written over 100 tabletop game reviews\n- Our staff visit numerous board game conventions & events\n- We've spent years interviewing industry experts like designers and artists\nThe testing process is very important to the GamesRadar+ team, and neither our writers nor I will never suggest a product in buying guides unless we're sure it's worth your time. If we aren't in love with it, it doesn't get on the list.\nTo ensure we're as up to date as possible, I cross-referenced popular choices from community forums too. My colleagues and I have also gotten expert opinions on the subject from well-known designers such as King of Tokyo creator Richard Garfield and the team at Modiphius.\nAs explained in our 'how we test board games' guide, our expert reviewers (who have many years of experience in the industry) spend as much time as they possibly can with any 2-player board game they're reviewing. That way, they can get a better sense of its pros, cons, and longevity. In addition, our writers always run a game multiple times with different amounts of players where appropriate. This helps us determine how the experience differs under these circumstances.\nWe then split our critique on this page into four distinct sections:\n- Introduction: This is where we discuss the 'elevator pitch' for a game, or \"what does it do differently?\" You'll also find reasons to buy / not to buy here.\n- Features & design: As well as discussing the basics of how a game works, we'll also dive into its physical components and art.\n- Gameplay: The bulk of our writing will be dedicated to the mechanics of a game, whether they're fun to play, and any issues we might have encountered.\n- Expert verdict: To finish, we like to quiz the reviewer themselves for their personal take on the game, or other members of our team to provide an alternate opinion.\nAdditionally, we rank 2-player board games using a standardized set of criteria before every expert verdict. We look at gameplay, accessibility (how easy it is to understand and get into), replayability, setup and pack-down, and component quality. Here's how this is all presented:\nCategory | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nGame mechanics | A rundown of how the game's systems hold up. | ?/5 |\nAccessibility | Is the game easy to learn?

Be sure to visit the overall GamesRadar+ review policy.\nBoard games for 2 players FAQ\nWhat are the most popular board games for 2 players?\nEven though I'm sure we can all name many 2-player board games we think should be dubbed the most popular, we'd probably be wrong - the answer is almost certainly chess. Yes, I know. I doubt it's the first game that comes to mind. But three million copies of chess are sold every single year, which is potentially more than any other game we could imagine combined.\nIt's a different story if you take a look the likes of Amazon's bestsellers list, though. Skyjo, Codenames, Scrabble, Guess Who, and Candy Land are all in the top handful of games. Seeing as Amazon is one of the largest retailers in the world, that feels like a pretty good temperature check.\nThings change again if we decide to focus on customer reviews instead. Amazon puts Splendor and Lords of Waterdeep near the top of the pile, while Cascadia (an award-winning game) also dominates listings thanks to extensive positive feedback.\nI'd certainly agree with the latter, but it's worth throwing Sky Team onto the pile as well. Despite being relatively new on the scene, it's already garnered a very warm reception and tops our own list of the best 2-player board games.\nPersonally speaking, I would add Disney Villainous into the mix too. In my opinion, it's one of the best 2-player board games ever made due to its complex and engaging strategies that change with each new character you use.\nDo you have your own suggestions? Add them to the comments below.\nWhat 2-player board games should I look forward to in 2025?\nThere are plenty of new 2-player board games on the way in 2025, and it's our job here at GamesRadar+ to keep an eye out for them. A few have particularly fired up our imagination, though, so these are the top three titles on our personal wishlist:\nGwent: The Legendary Card Game | View at Hachette\nSound familiar? It should - this is an adaptation of the hyper popular card game from the Witcher series, brought into real life by No Loading and ideal for head-to-head battles. We've actually seen this in person, and longtime contributor to the section Matt Thrower says in his UK Games Expo 2025 coverage that \"fans can rejoice that the core of the game remains intact, but there are lots of new play modes to take advantage of face to face play.\"\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: August 6, 2025\nTimber Town | View at Hachette\nWe absolutely adore games like Carcassonne and Life in Reterra here, and this newcomer (designed specifically with two players in mind) feels as if it's in the same vein. You've got to grab tiles as they 'float' down the river and use them to build a little beaver village. When combined with \"over 1,000 ways to score,\" Timber Town hits the right note if replayability is important to you. Contributor Matt Thrower singled this one out as Alley Cat Games' \"hottest new release\" in our UK Games Expo 2025 coverage, too.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: June-July, 2025\nBuilders of Baldur's Gate | View at Wizkids\nI always feel that in-depth city-builders are at their best with fewer players, so this one (which tasks you with constructing the iconic D&D metropolis) is a real contender for our list of the best 2-player board games when it launches in Q3 2025.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: July-September 2025\nFate of the Fellowship | View at Asmodee\nThere was an almighty stir when Z-Man Games announced that Pandemic creator Matt Leacock was making a Lord of the Rings game, and for good reason; he's a legend in the industry. Because Fate of the Fellowship is advertised as the most \"mechanically-rich Pandemic System design to date,\" it sounds perfect for digging into as a pair without the chaos of a larger group.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: Late June 2025\nThe Witcher: Path of Destiny | View at Gamefound\nStory-heavy games are a great choice for two players, because it means you can lose yourself in the narrative without having to rush things along and appease more impatient members of your party. This one takes the video game versions of these characters through previously unseen - but iconic - events of the franchise's short stories, with choose-your-own elements and gritty, morally gray quandaries to struggle through.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Release date: October-December 2025\nWhat are the best new 2-player board games in 2025?\nThe tabletop industry never sleeps, so a wealth of new 2-player board games arrived in 2025. Because there's a lot to choose from, these are the ones that caught the attention of the GamesRadar+ team and I.\nAzul Duel | View at Amazon\nThe Duel format has become incredibly popular over the last few years, so it's no surprise that the ever-popular Azul is jumping on the bandwagon. We're big fans of the original game here, so a small, head-to-head version is just what the doctor ordered.\nEverdell Duo | View at Amazon\nEverdell is a gap in my own tabletop knowledge, and finding enough willing victims players to try it with can be tough. That's why I was thrilled to see a 2-player version hit shelves this year. It condenses the worker placement system of its inspiration into a head-to-head challenge, and includes a campaign mode for long-term play.\nCritter Kitchen | View at Cardboard Alchemy\nIt's not specifically designed as a 2-player board game, but the adorable Critter Kitchen (from the publishers of Flamecraft) ticks off the 'cozy' vibe with ease. It's a perfect choice for you and your partner to curl up with when Fall arrives, ideally with a mug of hot cocoa each.\nWhere can I get cheap 2-player board games?\nTabletop can be an expensive hobby, and that's why the GamesRadar+ team and I track board game deals each and every week. If you'd like to go on a bargain hunt yourself, these are the retailers we prioritize ourselves. Keep an eye on them and you shouldn't go far wrong.\nUS\n- Amazon: The best for variety\n- Miniature Market: Deals on hobby games\n- Target: Often gets exclusives\n- Walmart: Surprisingly good discounts\n- Best Buy: Decent for family games\nUK\n- Amazon: Best for overall variety\n- Magic Madhouse: Surprisingly good offers\n- Zatu: Wide-ranging deals\n- Argos: Good reductions on classics\n- Very: Respectable family game deals\n- John Lewis: Solid deals on all kinds\nLooking for something a little different? Don't miss the best tabletop RPGs, or the best card games.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI've been writing about games in one form or another since 2012, and now manage GamesRadar+'s tabletop gaming and toy coverage. You'll find my grubby paws on everything from board game reviews to the latest Lego news."

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nEven though this is billed as an introduction to the beloved game, Horizons of Spirit Island is by no means less strategic than its predecessor. Less premium components help keep costs down, and the original's tactical complexity is allowed to shine unblemished. However, this does mean that the game can be hard to learn despite being pitched as more accessible.\nPros\n- +\nTough and highly varied strategy challenge\n- +\nFosters genuine cooperation among the players\n- +\nAppealing anti-colonial theme\nCons\n- -\nHard to learn, and the included 'introduction' doesn\u2019t help much\n- -\nPoor-quality components, especially compared to the full Spirit Island\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nHorizons of Spirit Island is a cut-price, stand-alone version of Spirit Island, one of the most popular and acclaimed cooperative board games ever produced. But what\u2019s been cut down isn\u2019t the gameplay - only the variety and production quality. That means you still get the full, deep, and demanding gameplay of the original, albeit with fixed boards instead of tiles and cardboard chits instead of miniatures.\nSo, is Horizons of Spirit Island worth getting instead of the original? Should you grab if you already have its predecessor? Let's dive in.\nFeatures & design\nPrice | $29.99 / \u00a329.99 |\nAges | 14+ |\nPlayers | 1 - 3 |\nLasts | 90 - 120mins |\nComplexity | High |\nPlay if you enjoy | Spirit Island |\n- A cheaper version of Spirit Island\n- Still the same tactical experience\n- Less premium components\nHorizons of Spirit Island is billed as an introductory version of the full title (which is often called one of the best board games on shelves right now), which has a reputation for dense complexity. That means it's more affordable and slightly less flashy in terms of components. The core concept remains the same, though; you play as supernatural entities that are trying to protect their home from invaders who are ruining the landscape and killing its native inhabitants (called 'Dahan').\nBasically? It's not quite as wholesome as the cover artwork would suggest.\nIn terms of how it works, each player takes the role of a spirit with a unique set of stats and starting cards. Among the many ways the spirits differ is in their growth options, which allow them to do things like gain cards, gain energy to play cards, or spread their influence around the map.\nYour first choice each turn is to decide how your spirit will grow, and then implement the effects of your selection while selecting cards with abilities that essentially boil down to damaging invaders, defending against their attacks, buffing yourself or your fellow players, and moving things around on the board.\nYour goal is to try and drive these invaders off the island before they cause too much damage. Often, this means destroying every colonist unit on the board. However, you can also scare them off by generating fear either through card effects or from destroying towns and cities. Build enough, and you\u2019ll get a fear card with a helpful effect. Get through enough fear cards, and you\u2019ll raise the terror level, making further fear effects more powerful. If you can empty the whole deck, then that\u2019s a secondary win condition.\nTo help you acclimatize, Horizons offers a full first-turn playthrough. However, this isn\u2019t all that helpful as it doesn\u2019t always explain why you do certain things, and the included rulebook is somewhat obtuse. It\u2019s also worth repeating that, rules-wise, this is the full Spirit Island experience; you just get less variety and downgraded components. The included spirits can even be used in the full game if you decide to go the whole hog.\nGameplay\n- Fosters a sense of genuine cooperation through the sheer volume of interlocking possibilities\n- Deterministic gameplay and fun theme keeps you challenged and engrossed\n- Tense curve that\u2019ll leave you feeling like victory is impossible, right up until you manage it\nMost modern cooperative games try and mix things up for the players, using hidden information to reduce the chance of one player bossing the others around. Horizons of Spirit Island, like its parent game, doesn\u2019t need to. Instead, it creates cooperation by simply presenting the players a vertical wall of overlapping strategic possibilities that they somehow need to navigate. You have to cooperate because there are simply too many paths, and too many obstacles, for one player to parse effectively.\nIt\u2019s hard to capture the full flowering of this effect without playing it, but for an example, take the speed system. Almost inevitably the powers you want to bring to bear early, to trim down the invaders before they act, are slow, and the ones you could wait until later to use are fast. You have limited card plays each turn, so you\u2019ll likely need to mix in some defensive cards, diluting your ability to take the fight to the enemy. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, especially since you\u2019ll need to spend a growth action to get your cards back every few turns.\nBut wait: what about the buffs that some spirits have? Perhaps you can use a buff to get the extra damage you need to knock out a city instead of an explorer. Or enough defence to let the Dahan survive and fight back. Or even a speed boost. That\u2019s down to whether you can communicate and coordinate effectively with your fellow spirits to get buffs you need while still leaving them the leeway to act themselves. With multiple spirits playing multiple cards, this strategy problem quickly expands to become exponential. It\u2019s a classic case of too much to do, too few things to do it with, except the problem is split among all the players and the solutions are far too convoluted to be obvious.\nYet, Horizons of Spirit Island is almost totally deterministic. There\u2019s no randomness here, other than the territories the invaders attack and the selection of new powers to choose from when you complete a growth action that gets you new cards. So it\u2019s down to you to try and pick apart the options and make the best choices. Given the game\u2019s theme, it can often feel like a genuinely heavy weight has fallen on your collective shoulders as you struggle to repel the destructive, rapacious colonists from your pristine corner of paradise.\nFor much of the game, it\u2019ll feel like this is an impossible struggle. Colonists multiply with terrifying speed, and it\u2019s all you can do to stop them stripping the island bare, let alone get a toe-hold in scaring them off or destroying them. Every fear card flipped, every city destroyed, feels like a desperate victory to cheer you on in the face of overwhelming odds. Until, quite suddenly, it isn\u2019t. As your spirits grow and acquire new powers, at some point you\u2019ll crest a hill where you can really make a difference.\nNot that this makes things easy, of course. There\u2019s still the interweaving web of strategy to plot out each turn, except now you\u2019re racing against the clock or the spread of blight to see if you can use your newfound competence to beat the game before it\u2019s too late. Win or lose, this contest to climb the hill and speed down the other side offers a superbly satisfying arc of tension and narrative for your group to enjoy.\nShould you buy Horizons of Spirit Island?\nThere\u2019s a good reason Spirit Island is so acclaimed among board games for adults, and if you\u2019ve been hankering to try it, or had your interest piqued by this review, Horizons of Spirit Island is a pretty good starting point. The lack of much to smooth the learning curve is regrettable, but the price point is very appealing and, if you enjoy the experience, the fact this is the full game without miniatures gives it plenty of longevity. Existing fans can leave this alone: the added spirits aren\u2019t interesting enough to justify the purchase. Otherwise, if you\u2019ve any interest in playing cooperatively with your group, then it\u2019s worth a punt: you might well be surprised.\nBuy it if...\nYou\u2019re interested in Spirit Island but put off by the cost\nIf you want a more affordable route into the beloved team game, Horizons is ideal. While its components are less flashy, it's much cheaper as a result.\nYou enjoy a very rich and varied strategic challenge\nAlthough it's cheaper, this isn't a 'my first Spirit Island' or some dumbed-down version of the original. It's just as layered and equally tactical, so fans of putting their gray matter to work will appreciate Horizons.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou already own the original game\nIf you're a veteran of the OG Spirit Island, you won't find much for you here - it's simply a cheaper version of the same thing.\nYou feel you\u2019ll struggle with a lot of rules or strategic complexity\nIf party games are more your speed, and you struggle with 'thinky' games in general, Horizons of Spirit Island won't be for you.\nHow we tested Horizons of Spirit Island\nAlong with playing games of Horizons of Spirit Island, I spent time comparing it to the original (something I already had in my collection). My process involved considerations around accessibility, how easy it was to learn, and what it was like in action. For more on our process, see our guide to how we test.\nThis review copy of Horizons of Spirit Island was provided by the publisher.\nMatt is a freelance writer specialising in board games and tabletop.
