  "description": "The California Coastal Commission unanimously rejected SpaceX's plan to nearly double rocket launches at Vandenberg to 95 per year on Thursday, citing environmental and regulatory concerns.",
  "content": "A contrail from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch is seen over homes in San Diego in 2024.\n\nThe California Coastal Commission has unanimously voted against SpaceX\u2019s plan for a dramatic expansion of rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base, citing environmental and regulatory concerns.\n\n\u201cThe sonic booms and their impacts on California\u2019s people, wildlife and property are extremely concerning,\u201d Commissioner Linda Escalante said at a hearing Thursday in Calabasas.\n\n\u201cThe negative impacts on public access, natural resources and environmental health warrant our scrutiny under California as a standard of review.\u201d\n\nSpaceX wants to boost annual launches from 50 to 95 per year, a massive jump from when SpaceX started at the Santa Barbara County facility in 2024.\n\nBut the accelerated timeline has increased friction between Elon Musk\u2019s space company and state regulators, who question whether SpaceX is sidestepping normal permitting processes by operating as a federal contractor.\n\nThe commission argues that the majority of launches serve commercial rather than government purposes. SpaceX has contracts with U.S. Department of Defense to launch spy satellites.\n\nMilitary officials maintain all launches benefit national security objectives, even missions deploying Starlink satellites for Musk\u2019s commercial internet service.\n\nHowever, commission staff argued the primary purpose of the launches is to expand SpaceX\u2019s commercial telecommunications network rather than serve federal agencies.\n\nA staff report emphasized that SpaceX now \u201cowns significantly more satellites than the combined total owned by every country and every other company in the world,\u201d supporting the company\u2019s recent $400-billion valuation.\n\nThe report argued that while the launches may benefit the federal government, the question is whether they are conducted \u201con behalf of\u201d the government rather than for commercial purposes.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what impact the California Coastal Commission\u2019s vote will have.\n\nIf launches qualify as federal activities, Space Force, a branch of the Department of Defense, can proceed without coastal commission permits and only needs to attempt mitigation agreements.\n\nThe Department of the Air Force was not present at the hearing, and the commission\u2019s unanimous objection does not prevent SpaceX from continuing its launch activities.\n\n\u201cI must say, I\u2019m just a little disappointed that the Air Force didn\u2019t want to participate with us,\u201d Commissioner Dayna Bochco said. \u201cI truly, truly hope that we can persuade them to conduct the monitoring, to do the work that it takes to understand how this rapid increase in launches is affecting not only the environment, but in this case now, the citizenry of the peoples that live around there.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of the Air Force and SpaceX could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe proposed expansion would nearly double SpaceX\u2019s current activity at Vandenberg, which hosted 51 launches last year, with 46 conducted by the company.\n\nThe proposal includes 24 rocket landing events annually, which generate additional sonic booms that have drawn complaints from coastal residents.\n\nEnvironmental groups including the Surfrider Foundation and Sierra Club opposed the expansion.\n\nJennifer Savage, a representative of the Surfrider Foundation, said Space Force is planning to proceed with the increase without providing the biological monitoring, sonic boom modeling or mitigation tracking needed to assess impacts.\n\nThe commission has identified deficiencies in current wildlife monitoring programs, particularly regarding impacts on marine mammals. Sonic booms from rocket launches and landings have been reported as far southeast as Ojai, with residents describing house-rattling effects.\n\nRelations between SpaceX and the commission have been strained since October, when commissioners rejected a plan for 50 annual launches.\n\nSpaceX responded by filing a federal lawsuit alleging the commission overstepped its authority and voted based on Musk\u2019s political activities rather than environmental concerns. That lawsuit is pending.\n\nCommission staff concluded that the Air Force \u201chas not provided sufficient information to enable the Commission to determine that the proposed project is consistent with the enforceable policies of the California Coastal Management Program.\u201d",

      "text": "SpaceX\u2019s Starship explodes on test stand in yet another setback\n- Share via\nA SpaceX Starship rocket exploded on a test stand in Texas, adding to a series of setbacks to Elon Musk\u2019s space ambitions that include trips to Mars.\nThe huge blast enveloped the craft as it stood upright on a test stand, before massive plumes of flames and smoke mushroomed into the night sky, video footage of the incident late Wednesday showed. The incident shook windows and rattled dishes, according to local media reports.\nThe rocket appeared to be undergoing a routine \u201cstatic fire test\u201d of its engines. That test is a prelaunch procedure in which a rocket\u2019s engines are fired while the rocket remains securely held on the ground \u2014 essentially a rehearsal for the real launch, enabling engineers to test the rocket\u2019s systems without sending it into space.\nMusk said on X that a specialized bottle that holds nitrogen probably failed.\n\u201cIf further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design,\u201d he said.\nNo one was injured and local residents aren\u2019t at risk, the company said, calling the explosion \u201ca major anomaly\u201d as the rocket program prepared for its 10th flight test.\nThe apparent destruction of the rocket extends the string of mishaps for a spaceship program that\u2019s central to NASA\u2019s plans to put American boots back on the moon \u2014 and also to Musk\u2019s grander ambitions to send cargo and people to Mars. The setback comes at a moment when Musk\u2019s business empire faces falling demand for Tesla Inc.\u2019s electric vehicles, and after Musk engaged in a public feud with President Trump.\nMusk\u2019s company holds contracts with NASA worth about $4 billion to land the agency\u2019s astronauts on the moon using Starship, the world\u2019s largest and most powerful launch system.\nSpaceX has experienced Starship mishaps during ground testing before. The earliest Starship prototypes either collapsed or exploded during propellant tests on the ground, well before the company began conducting routine test flights with the vehicle. However, Wednesday\u2019s explosion marked the first Starship failure in years during a ground test.\nThe company also has had explosive events ahead of static fire testing before. In 2016, one of the company\u2019s SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets exploded as it was being loaded with propellant, a rare failure for a rocket that now boasts a more than 99% mission success rate.\nSpaceX is rapidly building and testing new Starship prototypes at its Starbase test site in South Texas, meaning the company probably can slot in another craft relatively soon for the next mission. SpaceX follows a test flight regimen that entails pushing vehicles until they break to learn how they can fail, lessening the loss of any vehicle.\nHowever, it\u2019s another failure after a string of in-flight setbacks, making it unclear when SpaceX will start achieving many of the milestones it needs to meet to unlock the promises that Musk has made for Starship\u2019s future.\nLast month, SpaceX\u2019s colossal Starship disintegrated midflight after spinning out of control. That loss was its third consecutive setback after flights in January and March were cut short just minutes after takeoff when the spacecraft exploded over the Gulf of Mexico, sending debris raining down from the sky and disrupting air travel.\nJanuary\u2019s explosion was caused by a propellant leak and the March failure was triggered by a hardware problem with one of Starship\u2019s Raptor engines, according to SpaceX.\nStarship 10 hadn\u2019t been assigned an official launch date, and it\u2019s now unclear when the next flight will take place. After the failure of the ninth launch, SpaceX said it would carry out a data review and make improvements to the rocket system before the next test.\nAside from the failures, SpaceX celebrated some key achievements last year when Starship\u2019s booster was first caught at the launchpad using large mechanical arms, referred to as \u201cchopsticks.\u201d Designed to be reusable, Starship is meant to serve as the primary spacecraft for carrying humans to Mars and then bringing them back to Earth.\nMusk has said he plans to send a Starship rocket to the Red Planet carrying robots built by Tesla as early as 2026.\nAs the world\u2019s richest person steps back from his political work in Washington to refocus on his business empire, it remains unclear how much time he\u2019ll spend on Starship and SpaceX, and what changes he\u2019ll make inside the company to get the program back on track.\nWhitley , Duffy and Grush write for Bloomberg."

      "text": "SpaceX launch is delayed after widespread power outage scrubs mission with 45 seconds to spare\n- Share via\nA SpaceX rocket launch planned for Tuesday afternoon at Vandenberg Space Force Base was forced to take a rain check after a widespread power outage scrubbed the liftoff, according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration.\nThe power outage in the Santa Barbara region disrupted telecommunications at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center, creating a \u201cno-go condition for launch,\u201d NASA said in post.\nThe control center manages air traffic over 177,000 square miles of airspace including California\u2019s coast from L.A. to San Luis Obispo, the Ventura area and into the Pacific for about 200 miles, according to the FAA.\nThe decision came just 45 seconds before the rocket was set to launch, with a SpaceX official calling, \u201cHold, hold, hold. ... We have aborted launch today due to airspace concerns.\u201d\n\u201cThe FAA took this action to ensure the safety of the traveling public,\u201d the administration said.\nThe FAA also issued a ground stop at the Santa Barbara Airport on Tuesday due to the outage, the airport said in a statement. Flights were diverted and delayed. Power at the airport hadn\u2019t been restored as of about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to a spokesperson, who said that the ground stop would be lifted once power was restored to the area.\nIn addition, the outage disrupted 911 service throughout Santa Barbara County, according to KTLA.\nAs for the SpaceX launch, the rocket and its payloads were still in good shape, NASA said.\nAboard the rocket were two twin satellites, a part of NASA\u2019s TRACERS mission \u2014 Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites.\nThe two satellites will study Earth\u2019s magnetosphere by determining how magnetic explosions send solar wind particles into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and how those particles affect space technology and astronauts.\nThe launch was rescheduled to Wednesday at 11:13 a.m., NASA said. It will take place at Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg.\nLast month, a SpaceX launch from the same location lighted up the night sky across Southern California."

      "text": "SpaceX hopes to nearly double the rocket launches off the California coast; a state panel likely to object\n- Share via\nSpaceX wants to nearly double the number of rocket launches into space from the California coast, with plans for almost 100 a year from Vandenberg Space Force Base.\nThe plan would almost double the company\u2019s current timetable of 50 rockets a year, despite clashing with the California Coastal Commission over concerns about the impact that the blasts could have on coastal wildlife, and on nearby residents who have reported startling sonic booms with the already steep rise in launches.\nIn early 2024, SpaceX and the U.S. Department of the Air Force had an agreement with the California Coastal Commission to launch six rockets a year into space. But the Air Force and SpaceX have quickly moved to dramatically increase the number of rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force in Santa Barbara County, asking the commission to agree to 36, then to 50, and now 95 rocket blasts a year.\nA spokesperson for SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The California Coastal Commission is a state agency tasked with protecting the state\u2019s 1,100 miles of coastland.\nThe fast uptick in rocket launches off the California coast has put the space exploration company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, in direct conflict with the California Coastal Commission, whose members have raised concerns about the impact of the launches, the lack of monitoring and whether the privately owned company is circumventing the permit process because it is a federal contractor, despite most of the rocket launches involving no equipment or missions for U.S. agencies.\nIn October, the coastal commission rejected a plan for SpaceX to launch up to 50 times a year. Just days later, SpaceX responded by suing the commission and accusing the agency of \u201cegregiously and unlawfully overreaching its authority.\u201d\nThe dispute has taken on a political tone.\nDuring the October meeting, commissioners cited concerns that Musk had inserted himself into the presidential race, spread conspiracy theories on social media and faced serious allegations that employees at his companies have been mistreated.\nAbout 22 miles north of Santa Barbara, Lompoc has become a day trip destination for aerospace aficionados.\nCommissioners have also pointed to reports that Musk\u2019s company, Starlink, had refused to allow Ukraine to use satellite internet service to help carry out an attack against Russia in 2022, and questioned whether Musk\u2019s decisions did not directly conflict with those of a U.S. ally.\nIn the suit against the commission, which is still pending in federal court, attorneys for SpaceX accuse commissioners of voting against the plan because of Musk\u2019s political views.\nCooperation between the state commission and the Department of Air Force also seems to have flailed after the October meeting, with little agreement or communication between the two agencies.\nDuring the October meeting when the commission rejected the plan for 50 launches, officials from the base said they had hoped to work with the commission to address seven conditions that had been requested from the U.S. Space Force.\nBut according to the staff report, there\u2019s been limited progress, and little communication from the base, on those goals since.\nThe legal fight and disagreements with the commission, however, have had little effect on SpaceX and the U.S. Space Force\u2019s plans to ramp up the number of rocket blasts so far at Vandenberg Space Force Base.\nLast year, Vandenberg Space Force Base was the site of 51 rocket launches with 46 of them being conducted by Musk\u2019s SpaceX, according to a spokesperson for the base.\nAs of the first week of August, the base has been home to 38 rocket launches so far, with 33 of them being conducted by SpaceX.\nThe plan for more launches, submitted by the Air Force to the commission, would also double the number of landing events at the military base, which have also been reported to generate their own sonic boom blast. According to the staff report, the base expects 24 SpaceX rocket landing events a year at Vandenberg, including 12 first-stage booster landings and five Falcon Heavy missions that would have two boosters landing simultaneously at the base.\nSpaceX is also planning up to 76 at-sea landings off the coast of Baja California, Mexico. The company would then transport the equipment to the Port of Long Beach, and transfer it to Vandenberg Harbor, back to the base.\nOn Thursday, the California Coastal Commission is scheduled to consider SpaceX\u2019s plan to fire 95 rockets a year, but military officials are expected to move forward with the plan despite the panel\u2019s decision.\nMilitary officials have argued that the SpaceX launches should be considered federal activity because all of the launches \u2014 even those done for the private benefit of Musk\u2019s company, Starlink \u2014 also benefit U.S. military objectives.\nMexican scientists say debris from exploding SpaceX rockets is killing wildlife, including dolphins, sea turtles and fish.\nA previous staff report from the commission stated that 87% of SpaceX launches from Vandenberg weren\u2019t carrying equipment or conducting missions for government agencies, but were carrying equipment for Starlink.\nIf the launches are considered federal activity, Space Force officials are not legally bound to obtain a permit or permission from the coastal commission. Instead, they can try to reach an agreement to mitigate the effects of the blasts, but can move forward regardless of whether an agreement is reached.\nMilitary officials argue that all launches from the base benefit the readiness of the country.\n\u201cVandenberg Space Force Base plays a vital role in strengthening America\u2019s national security by leveraging the power of commercial innovation,\u201d Col. James T. Horne III, the Space Launch Delta 30 commander, said in a statement. \u201cThe commercial sector is driving advancements once exclusive to government programs, such as proliferated low Earth orbit communication systems that directly support the Department of Defense. U.S. launch providers continue to innovate, offering agile, service-based solutions that operate at the \u2018speed of need.\u2019 \u201d\nStaff for the coastal commission are expected to again raise concerns about the doubling of rocket launches from the base, arguing that military officials and SpaceX are not providing enough information about the impacts on wildlife, are failing to do enough monitoring to measure the impacts and reach of sonic booms, and that SpaceX should seek permits for its launches because it is conducting them for private benefit, not for the federal government.\n\u201cBased on existing information, the proposed SpaceX launch activities do not appear to be a federal agency activity,\u201d the report to the commission reads. \u201cRather, the existing available information indicates that the proposed launch cadence\u2019s primary purpose is to further expand and support SpaceX\u2019s commercial satellite internet and telecommunications network, Starlink.\u201d\nDespite the pending lawsuit, staff for the coastal commission continue to argue in its report that launches by SpaceX should be regulated as a private company.\n\u201cThe simple fact remains that it is a privately owned company engaged in activities primarily for its own commercial business,\u201d the report reads, which recommends that the board oppose the agreement. \u201cIt is not a public federal agency or conducting its launches on behalf of the federal government. It should therefore be regulated accordingly.\u201d"

      "text": "California officials reject more SpaceX rocket launches, with some citing Musk\u2019s X posts\n- Share via\nSpaceX\u2019s plans to launch more rockets from the California coast were rejected by a state commission this week, with some officials citing Elon Musk\u2019s political posts on X and raising concerns about the billionaire\u2019s labor record at his companies.\nThe plan to increase the number of rocket blasts into space up to 50 a year was rejected by the California Coastal Commission on Thursday despite assurances from Space Force and Air Force officials that they would increase efforts to monitor the effects that rocket launches have on nearby wildlife.\nThe military also vowed to mitigate the reach of sonic booms that often span across 100 miles of coastline, an issue that has caused controversy.\nMembers of the California Coastal Commission commended Space Force and Air Force representatives for reaching an agreement, but some cited their concerns about Musk, the owner of SpaceX, before rejecting the plan.\nAmong the issues raised were Musk\u2019s decision to insert himself in the presidential race, his spreading of conspiracy theories, the labor record of his companies and derogatory comments he has made about the transgender community.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a company, the head of which has aggressively injected himself into the presidential race,\u201d commission Chair Caryl Hart said.\nMilitary officials argue that launches by SpaceX, a leading contractor at Vandenberg Space Force Base, should be considered a federal activity because all of its launches benefit military objectives, regardless of whether the payloads being carried by the rockets are for the government or for Musk\u2019s private satellite internet company, Starlink.\nAs such, Space Force officials don\u2019t have to obtain a permit or permission from the California Coastal Commission for rocket launches; they only need to reach an agreement to mitigate the effects.\nBut commissioners in recent months have questioned whether SpaceX launches, which carry private Starlink equipment on up to 87% of their flights, should be considered private activity. That would mean that Musk\u2019s company would have to obtain permission from the California agency for launches carrying private equipment.\nMilitary officials have gone before the commission repeatedly this year to try to significantly increase the number of SpaceX launches, and officials said they plan to once again ask for another increase \u2014 for up to 100 annually \u2014 by early next year. But Musk\u2019s recent social media posts, and his growing presence and influence in national and global affairs, have become a concern by commission members considering an agreement that would see SpaceX increase its activities in California.\n\u201cThis company is owned by the richest person in the world with direct control of what could be the most expansive communications system in the planet,\u201d Commissioner Mike Wilson said. \u201cJust last week that person was talking about political retribution.\u201d\nWilson asked how could members of the commission be assured that equipment being launched would benefit U.S. interests if most of it was for the benefit of a private company.\n\u201cElon Musk is hopping about the country, spewing and tweeting political falsehoods and attacking [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] while claiming his desire to help hurricane victims with free Starlink access to the internet,\u201d Commissioner Gretchen Newsom said.\nThis is not the first time SpaceX and the state commission have clashed over an increase in rocket launches.\nEarlier this year, SpaceX sought to increase the number of launches from six to 36 a year, but commissioners noted the request came after the number of launches had already been exceeded.\nDuring a meeting in April, commissioners once again pushed back at the argument from military officials that all SpaceX activities benefited the U.S. government and should therefore be considered federal activity. Commissioners pointed to reports that Starlink had refused to allow Ukraine, a U.S. ally, to use its satellite internet service to help carry out an attack against Russia in September 2022.\nIn a post on X, Musk said there was a request from Ukraine to activate Starlink services with the intent to sink a Russian fleet, but that he did not agree to it because Starlink would then be \u201cexplicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.\u201d\nA spokesperson for SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment for this article. A spokesperson previously said in an email that all launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base, including commercial ones, were considered federal activity.\nThe commission rejected the agreement Thursday on a 6-4 vote.\nOfficials at Vandenberg Space Force Base said despite the vote, they were not deterred from working with the commission and finding a solution.\n\u201cToday\u2019s vote hasn\u2019t changed the [Department of the Air Force\u2019s] or Vandenberg\u2019s unwavering commitment to preserving the California coastline and the precious species that reside there,\u201d Ravi Chaudhary, assistant secretary of the Air Force for energy, installations and environment, said in a statement. \u201cThe Space Force\u2019s dedication to collaboration here is in many ways unprecedented \u2014 so is our commitment to ensuring dialogue continues.\u201d\nSpace Force officials in August had rejected commission demands to increase monitoring and mitigation efforts, frustrating commissioners tasked with preserving the California coast. But on Thursday, military officials had seemingly reversed their stance, agreeing to commission requests to increase monitoring and to set up an interagency working group that includes U.S. Fish and Wildlife, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Federal Aviation Administration to address concerns as the number of launches increases.\n\u201cWe hear you, and we\u2019re committed to working with you,\u201d Chaudhary said.\nThe plan would have allowed SpaceX to conduct up to 50 rocket launches a year from the military base in Santa Barbara County, but the company is expected to double that number by early 2025 as it continues to push its reach into space exploration as a leading Space Force contractor.\nOn Thursday, members of the commission lauded military officials for their work to reach an agreement, but plainly stated their main concern is that it should be SpaceX representatives who should be before the commission to obtain permits for the company\u2019s growing rocket program, not military officials.\n\u201cIt is essential that SpaceX apply for a [Coastal Development Permit],\u201d Hart said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit a wall here.\u201d\nSpaceX\u2019s rapid expansion has pitted the company against state and federal agencies at times. Musk, who also owns X, has used the social media company to criticize the FAA after the agency proposed fining SpaceX over license requirements, and for delays over the licensing for the SpaceX Starship 5.\nThe California Coastal Commission also raised concerns this year over the launches after residents reported that sonic booms were jolting and startling residents and wildlife across the coast. Initially, military officials reported sonic booms from rocket blasts out of Vandenberg Space Force base were rare. But Air Force officials in June acknowledged sonic booms were regularly reaching across more than 100 miles of coastline from Santa Barbara County to as far as Los Angeles County.\nResidents from Lompoc to Camarillo reported feeling the impacts of the booms for months, and Space Force officials said changes in flight trajectories have made the sonic booms audible to people in Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties.\nWorries about the expanding reach and impact of the sonic booms prompted members of the commission to ask military officials to better monitor and mitigate the effects of the rocket launches.\nThe commission can\u2019t unilaterally impose restrictions or conditions on the military, which uses SpaceX as a military contractor, but it works to reach agreements with the military to mitigate the effects on the environment and coast."

      "text": "Mexico threatens to sue Musk\u2019s SpaceX over contamination from exploding rockets\n- Share via\n- Mexican scientists say wreckage from failed rocket flights is killing wildlife, including dolphins, sea turtles and fish.\n- Space X says the material from rocket failures does not does not present any chemical, biological or toxicological risks.\nMexico City \u2014 A small Texas town just across the border from Mexico is the testing ground for Starship, the hulking spacecraft that Elon Musk hopes will one day ferry people to Mars.\nIn recent months, multiple test launches have ended in explosions, causing debris to rain down on both countries and in the Gulf of Mexico.\nMexican scientists say the wreckage is killing wildlife, including dolphins, sea turtles and fish.\nAmid growing pressure from her constituents, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said this week that her government is investigating the \u201csecurity and environmental\u201d effects of Musk\u2019s rockets and has found that \u201cthere is indeed contamination,\u201d a charge Musk\u2019s company denies.\nSheinbaum said her government is trying to determine whether SpaceX has violated international laws and said Mexico will file \u201cnecessary lawsuits.\u201d\nSince Trump took office in January, hurling insults and threatening devastating tariffs and U.S. drone strikes, Mexico has been seized by a nationalistic fervor.\nHer statements come amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Mexico on security, migration and the economy. President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexican imports and threats of U.S. drone strikes on cartel targets have sparked a surge of nationalism here.\nMusk, a billionaire who is also the CEO of Tesla and the owner of X, is closely allied with the U.S. administration, having donated more than a quarter-billion dollars to help elect Trump. For several months this year he was the informal head of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\nSpaceX said in a post on X that independent tests performed on the material used in Starships confirm that it \u201cdoes not present any chemical, biological or toxicological risks.\u201d\nThe company said it attempts to recover all debris from exploded devices.\nU.S. groups have also blamed SpaceX rockets for environmental degradation. The company\u2019s Starbase launch facility in South Texas abuts the Boca Chica Wildlife Refuge, an expanse of tidal flats, mangroves and sand dunes that is home to rare and endangered species including ocelots, sea turtles and northern aplomado falcons.\nA coalition including the Sierra Club and a local Native American tribe sued the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, alleging the agencies approved test launches without conducting thorough environmental reviews. They say failed rocket launches have spread concrete and metal debris across thousands of feet of surrounding lands \u2014 and once set off a fire that burned several acres of protected dunes.\nIn Mexico, environmentalists began raising alarms earlier this year after space debris was discovered in the border city of Matamoros, in the R\u00edo Bravo \u2014 as Mexico calls the Rio Grande \u2014 and in the Gulf of Mexico.\nA local nonprofit in the state of Tamaulipas issued a report documenting animal deaths in a region known as a nesting ground for manatees, sharks, whales and other animals. It warned particularly about risks to sea turtles who ingest particles of space debris.\nThe group said it had collected more than a ton of debris scattered along an area more than 25 miles long.\nThe governor of Tamaulipas said authorities were also looking into the issue. Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal Anaya said his government will verify whether \u201cthe internationally required distances are being respected in order to have these types of facilities so that there is no risk to urban centers.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The California Coastal Commission has unanimously rejected SpaceX's proposal to nearly double rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base, citing environmental concerns and the impact of sonic booms on local residents and wildlife. The commission argues that most launches serve commercial purposes rather than federal objectives, raising questions about whether SpaceX should be exempt from state permitting processes. This decision follows a history of tension between SpaceX and the commission, exacerbated by Elon Musk's political activities and the company's ongoing legal disputes with state regulators.",
