      "title": "Rivian's CEO explains why he got a Ph.D. — and why he chose MIT over Stanford",
      "summary": "RJ Scaringe, founder of Rivian, used his MIT Ph.D. in automotive mechanical engineering to quickly establish credibility and attract investors for his electric vehicle startup, bypassing the traditional 20‑year industry path. He chose MIT over Stanford because of its automotive‑specific program and lab, believing the degree would make it easier to secure funding. Scaringe’s strategy reflects MIT’s reputation as a breeding ground for entrepreneurs, with alumni like Intel’s Robert Noyce and Boston Dynamics’ Marc Raibert. His experience shows that a prestigious Ph.D. can serve as a powerful tool for early‑stage EV founders seeking capital and legitimacy.",
