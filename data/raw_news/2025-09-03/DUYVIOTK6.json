  "description": "Empire of AI author Karen Hao joins TechCrunch Equity to explore how OpenAI transformed from nonprofit to $90 billion powerhouse and the hidden costs of AI's boom.",
  "content": "Karen Hao, the bestselling author of \u201cEmpire of AI,\u201d has watched OpenAI go from a nonprofit \u201claughingstock\u201d into a $90 billion powerhouse chasing artificial general intelligence at breakneck speeds. Hao, who first profiled the company back in 2020, says early visions of building AI \u201cfor humanity\u2019s benefit\u201d were quickly overtaken by a familiar Silicon Valley mindset: Move fast, break things, and let scale be the measure of success.\n\nThis week, Hao joined TechCrunch\u2019s Equity podcast to unpack the direction the AI boom is going and who\u2019s paying the price. Hao argues that, like historical empires, today\u2019s AI giants rely on resource-hoarding and exploitative labor to amass political and economic power, and they\u2019re doing so at the expense of the environment. For investors and founders, it\u2019s a clear signal that AI\u2019s current path carries real risks, and that there\u2019s room to build a better model.\n\nListen to the full episode to hear:\n\u2022 How OpenAI\u2019s three internal \u201cclans\u201d warred to shape the company\u2019s trajectory\n\u2022 The hidden human costs of data labeling in developing countries\n\u2022 Where founders might find different opportunities beyond the pursuit of AGI\n\nEquity will be back Friday with our weekly news roundup, so stay tuned.\n\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.

      "text": "Empire of AI\nAn instant NYT bestseller\n\u201cA heroic work\u201d \u2014Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\nBuy the book\nJoin the tour\nFrom a brilliant longtime AI insider with intimate access to the world of Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI from the beginning, an eye-opening account of arguably the most fateful tech arms race in history, reshaping the planet in real time, from the cockpit of the company that is driving the frenzy\nWhen AI expert and investigative journalist Karen Hao first began covering OpenAI in 2019, she thought they were the good guys. Founded as a nonprofit with safety enshrined as its core mission, the organization was meant, its leader Sam Altman told us, to act as a check against more purely mercantile, and potentially dangerous, forces. What could go wrong?\nOver time, Hao began to wrestle ever more deeply with that question. Increasingly, she realized that the core truth of this massively disruptive sector is that its vision of success requires an almost unprecedented amount of resources: the \u201ccompute\u201d power of high-end chips and the processing capacity to create massive large language models, the sheer volume of data that needs to be amassed at scale, the humans \u201ccleaning up\u201d that data for sweatshop wages throughout the Global South, and a truly alarming spike in the usage of energy and water underlying it all. The truth is that we have entered a new and ominous age of empire: only a small handful of globally scaled companies can even enter the field of play. At the head of the pack with its ChatGPT breakthrough, how would OpenAI resist such temptations?\nSpoiler alert: it didn\u2019t. Armed with Microsoft\u2019s billions, OpenAI is setting a breakneck pace, chased by a small group of the most valuable companies in human history\u2014toward what end, not even they can define. All this time, Hao has maintained her deep sourcing within the company and the industry, and so she was in intimate contact with the story that shocked the entire tech industry\u2014Altman\u2019s sudden firing and triumphant return. The behind-the-scenes story of what happened, told here in full for the first time, is revelatory of who the people controlling this technology really are.\nBut this isn\u2019t just the story of a single company, however fascinating it is. The g forces pressing down on the people of OpenAI are deforming the judgment of everyone else too\u2014as such forces do. Naked power finds the ideology to cloak itself; no one thinks they\u2019re the bad guy. But in the meantime, as Hao shows through intrepid reporting on the ground around the world, the enormous wheels of extraction grind on. By drawing on the viewpoints of Silicon Valley engineers, Kenyan data laborers, and Chilean water activists, Hao presents the fullest picture of AI and its impact we\u2019ve seen to date, alongside a trenchant analysis of where things are headed. An astonishing eyewitness view from both up in the command capsule of the new economy and down where the real suffering happens, Empire of AI pierces the veil of the industry defining our era.\nPraise\n\u201cOur lives are about to be remade by artificial intelligence\u2014or to be more accurate, by a few companies run by a few very self-confident people. If you ever wondered whether all of this is inevitable, whether to believe all the promises of tech luminaries, whether we could save a little bit of our democracy in the age of AI, then read this book!\u201d\n\u2014 Daron Acemoglu, Institute Professor, MIT, and recipient of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences\n\u201cWith devastating revelations, deep insider research, and delightful page-turning delivery, Karen Hao shows us why she is one of the foremost tech journalists covering AI. From data centers in Chile to data workers in Kenya, Empire of AI reveals the hidden human and environmental costs behind AI products that have triggered a race for land, water, and cheap labor to cement power in the hands of a few. Empire of AI is the warning we need\u2014just as more open and less energy-intensive alternatives reveal that a different AI future is possible and achievable.\u201d\n\u2014 Dr. Joy Buolamwini, founder of Algorithmic Justice League and best-selling author of Unmasking AI\n\u201cIn her brilliant book, Empire of AI, Karen Hao chronicles the mania surrounding artificial intelligence and OpenAI. With a cast of scientists, scammers, and scoundrels, Empire of AI documents the hype campaign that caused the world to fall in love with a technology whose immediate harms are legion and benefits remain unproved.\u201d\n\u2014 Roger McNamee, cofounder of Elevation Partners and New York Times-bestselling author of Zucked\n\u201cKaren Hao's Empire of AI is an epic expos\u00e9 that pulls back the curtain on the egos and uneasy compromises behind the rise of OpenAI and ChatGPT. It's full of dark details, some of them bordering on absurd, that shows how much of the AI boom runs on secrecy and is driven by questionable ideologies. This book serves as a warning about the price we all pay when AI builders who dreamed of utopia got swept up in a race to build empires instead.\u201d\n\u2014 Parmy Olson, Bloomberg columnist and author of Supremacy\n\u201cEmpire of AI is a heroic work. Karen Hao braved many obstacles with gritty determination as she traveled the yellow brick road to the Oz of the storied corporation OpenAI to bring us this work of essential public education. Her courage was rewarded with truth. Altman, a cunning young man with outsized ambition and excellent \u2018people skills,\u2019 condemned the world to the digital violence of an approach to \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 that can only exist by devouring the totality of the world\u2019s information and then the world itself. Mr. Altman was no wizard, and the seers of our digital future had little vision beyond their own baseless rhetoric and the billions of dollars from greedy or guileless investors. Hao is a gifted journalist and a deep thinker who reveals the historical significance and societal consequences of Silicon Valley\u2019s AI spectacle, even as she meticulously documents a company and its leader hellbent on getting there first with no idea where they are going. If you think the digital future is safe in the hands of brilliant scientists, smart investors, and earnest political leaders, read this book and think again.\u201d\n\u2014 Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Charles Edward Wilson Professor Emeritus, Harvard Business School\nTour dates\nOct 13\nNew York, NY\nNew York University\nDetails forthcoming.\nNov 10\nBudapest, HU\nHVG\nDetails forthcoming\nPhoto credit: \u00a9 Shoko Takayasu\nAbout the Author\nKaren Hao is an award-winning journalist covering the impacts of artificial intelligence on society. She writes for publications including The Atlantic and leads the Pulitzer Center\u2019s AI Spotlight Series, a program training thousands of journalists around the world on how to cover AI.
