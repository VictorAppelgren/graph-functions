  "description": "How secure, agentic AI transforms retail operations intelligently",
  "content": "Agentic AI systems go beyond traditional machine learning and chatbots. They are capable of intelligently automating real-world workplace processes end-to-end. These systems operate based on goals \u2014 not just instructions. They reason, decide, and act, which is why industries like retail are putting agents into the hands of their frontline retail assistants.\n\nAI agents are making them more connected, giving them more visibility into inventory management and sales opportunities and requests, and intelligently automating tasks on the shop floor.\n\nFor example, an agent can interpret a customer\u2019s return request and automatically trigger the associated logistics workflows. This includes initiating return approval, notifying the warehouse, and updating stock levels in near real time. They will be a digital autonomous worker augmenting the frontline worker.\n\nAgents can also monitor inventory across locations and autonomously place supplier orders based on current trends. This kind of real-time optimization helps prevent overstocking or stockouts without manual intervention.\n\nThey can coordinate promotional activity by updating pricing across e-commerce, POS, and marketing systems. This ensures consistency and timeliness during time-sensitive campaigns. Some agents can even pull data from internal dashboards and external tools to create concise executive summaries \u2014 surfacing key insights for decision-makers.\n\nAgentic AI unlocks massive value \u2014 but it also increases the system's responsibility. These agents take steps that can directly affect operations, revenue, and customer experience. There are some real-world concerns that developers, IT and operational technology leaders need to be aware of and address:\n\u2022 Prompt manipulation: malicious inputs \u2014 from customers or attackers \u2014 can cause agents to behave unpredictably, such as altering orders or issuing refunds.\n\u2022 Tool misuse: an agent might access internal tools like pricing APIs or campaign systems not intended for autonomous control, creating unapproved changes.\n\u2022 Oversight failures: without business logic context, an agent might repeat a failed task multiple times, unintentionally escalating an error, which could impact revenues or tarnish the companies Brand.\n\u2022 Data leakage: AI-generated outputs could reveal confidential product performance, SKU-level details, or inventory patterns if not properly controlled.\n\u2022 Automation drift: over time, agents may subtly shift behavior without detection, eventually misaligning with business goals or policies.\n\u2022 Firewall / access control: clear rules on who and what can communicate with and through the Agent to prevent hijacking or misuse of the agent\n\nThese are not theoretical; they\u2019re practical risks that increase with automation. The solution is not to avoid agentic AI \u2014 but to deploy it with secure, observable limits and governed design and collaboration with partners who can provide the agents, implementation, IT and developer support needed.\n\nTo deploy agentic AI responsibly, IT and OT leaders in industries like retail must embrace a lifecycle approach that balances innovation with control. This begins by defining clear agent boundaries by being explicit about what the agent is allowed to do autonomously, with a human-in-the-loop authorizing it \u2014 and equally clear about what it should never attempt.\n\nWhether it\u2019s initiating refunds, accessing customer data, or editing product listings, hard lines need to be drawn around the agent\u2019s authority to prevent scope creep.\n\nNext, consider threat model early in the design process using industry standards, and think like an adversary: how could someone trick the agent? Could it be misused internally or externally? Could it escalate its access? Mapping out abuse scenarios in advance helps identify controls before the agent ever sees production.\n\nLook at hardening the prompts and internal logic the agent relies on. Avoid building agents that are overly general or capable of improvising beyond their business intent. Guardrails in how agents interpret instructions, reason through tasks, and make decisions are critical for safe autonomy.\n\nAnd test collaboratively across teams before going live. Involve AI developers, operations, business stakeholders and security teams. This cross-functional testing helps uncover blind spots and ensures the agent performs safely across real-world use cases.\n\nFinally, monitor and retrain agents post-launch. Behavior can drift over time \u2014 even in systems without direct learning loops. Set up real-time monitoring and observability pipelines, performance thresholds, and retraining checkpoints. Treat agents like evolving operational systems, not static deployments.\n\nFive Principles for Secure Agentic AI in Retail\n\nAgentic AI is a game-changer for industry \u2014 enabling faster decisions, connected frontline workers and intelligently automated operations. It\u2019s an intelligent teammate that requires thoughtful onboarding, boundaries, and oversight.\n\n1. Start with least privilege: give agents access only to the APIs and datasets they require \u2014 no more. Use access scopes, allowlists, and granular permissions. Avoid giving full control to agents unless business-critical and thoroughly vetted.\n\n2. Harden the input surface: before feeding customer input into an agent, sanitize and validate it. Apply AI firewalls or prompt guards to prevent instruction injection. Clearly separate user inputs from system prompts to prevent confusion or abuse.\n\n3. Observe more than outputs: log what the agent did and how it made its decisions. Track internal reasoning, external API calls, and unusual behavior like repeated refund attempts. Observation should go deeper than final outputs.\n\n4. Isolate and control execution: run agents in sandboxed or staged environments for high-risk tasks. Restrict their internet access unless required. Use just-in-time credentials and frequently rotate tokens to minimize attack surfaces.\n\n5. Test like an adversary: simulate edge cases, abuse inputs, and worst-case scenarios before production deployment. Ensure agents can\u2019t access restricted systems like HR or finance. Treat agents like software \u2014 and red-team them regularly.\n\nDevelopers, IT, and OT leaders in industries like retail who partner with AI providers and design agentic AI with security and governance from day one will lead \u2014 not just in innovation, but in trust and resilience.\n\nSeek out AI partners who can provide industry trained ready-to-use AI agents to deliver faster return on investment, and the scope to develop and add more agents with the AI platform and tooling for creating, deploying, and maintaining agentic solution components across a product portfolio, enabling easy development of AI applications and solutions.\n\nPrioritize partners with industry knowledge and a track record working closely with developers to discover what tools will be useful for a full end-to-end AI pipeline. This will support developers and software partners to collect data, train AI models, and deploy across customer devices with an AI software development kit (vision, voice, data, and GenAI) and pre-trained models.\n\nAnd AI APIs for cloud, hybrid, and edge solutions will provide an easy-to-use ecosystem to integrate into any business application.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "How Agentic AI transforms enterprise automation\nAgentic AI enables secure, adaptive automation within enterprise constraints\nThere\u2019s a lot of noise in enterprise AI right now. Under mounting pressure to deliver faster, safer digital services, businesses are turning to the next evolution in automation: Agentic AI.\nNo, this isn\u2019t bolting on a chatbot and calling it digital transformation. AI agents are built to understand your organization, operating within your domain constraints with real autonomy. These agents operate inside your business, using your data to automate decisions, adapt to real-world problems in milliseconds, and embed themselves directly into operational workflows.\nThey blend the general reasoning power of today\u2019s large language models with domain- specific intelligence grounded in company data. That might be clinical records, compliance frameworks, or engineering logs - whatever your business runs on. The result? Systems that take action: surfacing insights, automating tasks, and adapting based on your company policies and workflows.\nChief Marketing Officer at Vultr.\nWhy it matters now\nDemand for automation is growing, as are expectations around compliance, transparency, and data governance, especially in Europe. Agentic AI offers a response to both: scalable intelligence, designed to work inside complex regulatory frameworks.\nThat matters in sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services, where data security, explainability, and reliability aren't negotiable. These aren\u2019t markets where \u201cgood enough\u201d is acceptable. Customers simply can not tolerate hallucinated responses or unreliable systems where their data hits the public domain.\nAgentic AI is safer. Not because it\u2019s slower or more cautious, but because it\u2019s built for the environment it\u2019s deployed into.\nInside the architecture\nAgentic systems rely on a layered approach, with different types of agents operating across an organization:\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\n- Human assistance agents support real-time decisions, generating summaries, highlighting next steps, and assisting in code review or sales workflows. They keep humans in control while removing friction from day-to-day tasks.\n- Transactional agents manage system-to-system workflows. They handle onboarding, verification, or inventory reconciliation autonomously when appropriate, with escalation when edge cases arise.\n- Autonomous agents identify and solve problems independently. In domains like DevOps, logistics, or diagnostics, they monitor environments, anticipate failures, and act proactively rather than reactively to resolve these types of issues. These agents work in tandem rather than in isolation. Together, they form an intelligent layer across enterprise systems - learning, adapting, and coordinating actions in ways that were previously siloed or manual. True digital transformation across the enterprise.\nVector-based context\nKey to all of this is the use of custom vector databases. Vector databases enable AI agents to fetch relevant, security-controlled context from sensitive data without actually exposing that data in its original form to the agent. This is a game-changer for regulated industries. Rather than relying on generic training data from the public internet, this draws directly from the institutional knowledge inside your firewalls.\nThat means better accuracy, stronger compliance, and fewer surprises. It also means outputs that reflect your standards, rather than what\u2019s statistically likely.\nEuropean inferencing\nAgentic systems are already transforming highly regulated sectors in Europe. In healthcare, they reduce administrative overheads, improve triage, and accelerate innovation while protecting patient privacy. In manufacturing, they\u2019re powering predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and real-time field service. Within finance, these agents enhance fraud detection, refine compliance, and provide hyper- personalized services.\nAgentic AI adoption is particularly strong in regions with tighter data controls - namely France, Germany, and the Nordics - because these systems respect the boundaries enterprises are required to operate within.\nThese systems increasingly rely on serverless inference, which allows businesses to scale their AI infrastructure without wedding themselves to their maximum theoretical usage. That\u2019s critical in Europe, where innovation budgets are often tight, and sovereign infrastructure matters. Agentic AI is being built to meet those regulatory requirements from day one.\nYes, Europe\u2019s regulatory environment slows things down. But that friction forces better thinking. It pushes enterprises to build with trust, accountability, and explainability. Creating market conditions where sustainable AI can thrive.\nGDPR, the EU AI Act, NIS2 and other regulatory frameworks define the standards by which responsible AI can scale. As US start-ups chase MVPs and launch before the proper guardrails are in place, European enterprises may end up with AI that\u2019s more compliant and generally more effective in the long term.\nThe next step\nAgentic AI marks a turning point in how businesses interact with their data and workflows. It moves beyond static automation to deliver systems that act, learn, and improve within the constraints enterprises define.\nThis is not a plug-and-play future. It\u2019s a future that demands thoughtful design, domain- specific strategy, and an unflinching focus on outcomes. The rewards will be sustainable and significant for the organizations that build smart and scale responsibly. The hype in off-the-shelf, plug-and-play solutions will fade. Agentic AI infrastructure is built for the latest ways of working. Enterprises that invest now and build with intent will lead in the next stage for what\u2019s next.\nWe've featured the best AI writer.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

You should be able to contact a human support representative via email, telephone, or live chat when you need one. You should also have access to additional support resources such as user guides and video tutorials.\nEssential features of an IT automation tool\n1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation (RPA) entails building and deploying software robots to handle repetitive tasks. For example, you can build bots to scrape websites and extract contact information or create bots to process employee payroll based on the number of hours worked.\nYour IT automation platform should let you build RPA bots, preferably with a drag-and-drop interface.\n2. Incident management\nYou should be able to manage technical incidents with ease. Your tool should give automatic alerts whenever it detects an IT incident and contact the personnel assigned to that issue beforehand. This feature takes away a lot of stress during the inevitable IT incident.\n3. Endpoint management\nThe tool should enable IT staff to manage multiple devices connected to the enterprise network and automate many tasks. For example, you should be able to install software automatically on all connected devices. It could be a new software recommended by management or an update to an already installed software. You can also automatically check for viruses and security bugs and deploy fixes immediately.\nEndpoint management automation makes IT management much easier for everyone, especially in large organizations.\nHow we tested the best IT automation tools\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service.

      "text": "Best POS system of 2025\nPayment systems and ePOS software\nWe list the best Point Of Sale (POS) systems, to make it simple and easy to take payments in a store, a restaurant, or an event\nPoint-of-sale (POS) systems are the heart of many brick-and-mortar businesses. They enable business owners to receive payments without worrying about reliability and security.\nIn the early stages of the POS market, business owners mainly sought a simple solution for receiving and tracking payments. However, expectations have changed as the industry has matured. Businesses now look at complementary features that help them run operations in addition to receiving payments.\nI tested many POS systems so you don\u2019t have to stress yourself out about finding the best options with reliable payment processing and complementary features. In this buying guide, I\u2019ve curated the best POS systems for different use cases and explained what makes them excellent choices.\nReader offer: Get a GoDaddy $499.00 Smart Terminal POS device for free\nBoost productivity from the storefront to the back office with a sleek, modern POS terminal from GoDaddy. There\u2019s no contract to sign, and they offer 24/7 support. Plus, GoDaddy offers low processing fees starting from 2.3%* for in-person transactions.\nIf your business is a small one or a startup, then you might want to take a look at our guide to the best POS for small businesses; we also have guides tailored for different business types: the best POS for retail, and the best POS for restaurants and bars.\nThe best POS systems of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest general-purpose POS system\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nShopify is best known as an e-commerce platform but offers one of the best point-of-sale (POS) systems for brick-and-mortar retailers. Unsurprisingly, Shopify\u2019s POS system is heavily integrated with its e-commerce tools. It\u2019s an excellent option if you sell both online and in person.\nShopify offers one of the most intuitive interfaces I\u2019ve used in a POS system, and it\u2019s more impressive given its broad feature set. Its designers packed numerous features into an intuitive interface that was easy to understand.\nYou can manage your inventory seamlessly when using Shopify. Adding products to your catalog with key details like prices and variants is easy. When a customer buys an item, it\u2019s automatically subtracted from the inventory, and you can receive alerts when its quantity falls below a specific threshold.\nDepending on your Shopify plan, transaction fees range from 2.4% to 2.7%. Every plan includes free access to the POS Lite features, but accessing advanced POS Pro features requires an extra $89 per month per POS device. For example, POS Pro lets you monitor multiple POS systems from a centralized dashboard.\nBecause of its relatively high fees, Shopify is best suited for medium and large businesses, not small businesses with limited budgets.\nRead our full Shopify review.\nBest POS system for hotels\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEpos Now is a versatile POS system that suits many business categories. However, I consider it the top choice for hotels, hostels, and related hospitality businesses.\nEpos Now provides many features that make running your hospitality business easier. For example, you can list all available rooms (and their prices) in your inventory, and customers can choose and pay for anyone. You can collect customer data during bookings and leverage this data to run personalized marketing campaigns.\nThe standard transaction fee when using Epos Now is 2.6% plus 10 cents. The subscription costs $39 monthly (on a one-year term) for software only and $79 monthly for Epos Now\u2019s hardware and software.\nEpos Now\u2019s hardware options are expensive, but a good thing is that it\u2019s compatible with external hardware systems. You can subscribe only to its software and buy hardware from other vendors. However, integrating external hardware with Epos Now is more complex than using the native hardware.\nApart from hospitality, Epos Now offers tailor-made features for retailers, restaurants, and service providers. It has a user-friendly interface that\u2019s simple to navigate.\nRead our full Epos Now review.\nBest POS for restaurants\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nToast offers the best POS system with sophisticated features if you run a restaurant. It\u2019s tailor-made for restaurant owners and provides crucial features you\u2019ll hardly find elsewhere.\nFor instance, you can create detailed restaurant menus in a few steps, specifying many variants for a product. You can get a Kitchen Display System (KDS) to automatically display all orders from the counter to your kitchen staff. This display system saves considerable time and prevents errors that often occur when orders are sent manually to kitchen staff.\nToast has direct integrations with food delivery apps like DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats. Hence, you can process delivery orders seamlessly within your payment system. Save for food delivery, I like that Toast offers a host of other integrations, ranging from customer loyalty apps to inventory and tax management tools.\nTransaction fees range from 2% to 2.75% plus 15 cents, and subscriptions start at $69 monthly. The drawback is that Toast requires customers to sign long-term contracts of 1 to 3 years instead of paying month to month. This limitation makes it suitable for large restaurants rather than small ones.\nRead our full Toast review.\nBest POS system for simplicity\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoDaddy might be a surprising name to find in a buying guide about the best POS systems. It\u2019s most famous for offering domain name services, with a mixed reputation, but GoDaddy also offers a point-of-sale system for businesses.\nI chose GoDaddy POS because of its simplicity, flexibility, and reporting features. It doesn\u2019t offer the most sophisticated POS solution, but it provides something sufficient to accept and track payments. The checkout process feels smoother than most POS systems on this list.\nGoDaddy has advanced inventory management tools. You can keep stock counts and receive alerts when they fall below a specific threshold. Your inventory can be managed from the GoDaddy POS smartphone app or directly from the terminal.\nAlong with being a domain name registrar, GoDaddy also offers e-commerce tools for businesses. Its POS system is directly integrated with its e-commerce platform, making it convenient to sell online and in person. Your online and brick-and-mortar stores can share the same inventory; any transaction in either reflects on your dashboard.\nThe main drawback I observed is GoDaddy\u2019s limited customization. It\u2019s an affordable and simple solution for small and medium-sized enterprises, but it\u2019s not the best for larger retailers that rely on tailor-made features.\nRead our full GoDaddy review.\nBest POS for online retailers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSquare is the best general-purpose system I tested. It strikes an ideal balance between pricing, features, integration, and ease of use. It doesn\u2019t offer as many features as some rivals, but it\u2019s a much more affordable solution. Unlike many competitors, Square charges no recurring monthly or annual subscriptions. You\u2019ll only pay transaction fees after buying the hardware.\nSquare is a simple POS solution that\u2019s suitable for small businesses. You can buy its portable card reader, plug it into your smartphone, and run your business from the Square mobile app. I appreciate that you don\u2019t need much money to set up and use Square.\nYet, if you need a more sophisticated solution, it\u2019s available. You can get the Square all-in-one Terminal, with everything running on the device instead of your smartphone. You can also choose the Square Register, an all-in-one solution for retail stores.\nSquare\u2019s versatility is its selling point. With a standard transaction fee of 2.6% plus 15 cents and broad hardware options, Square suits various business categories from stores to hotels, cafes, service providers, etc. However, I observed issues with scalability. Scaling from one Square POS system to multiple ones (tied to the same account) isn\u2019t as seamless as on other POS systems I tested.\nRead our full Square review.\nBest POS for customization\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLightspeed is a sophisticated, versatile POS system that offers custom solutions for various use cases, including convenience stores, hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and more.\nI chose Lightspeed because it\u2019s the most customizable POS solution I tested. You can customize product details, e.g., adding new fields like sizes and colors to your inventory. You can also modify product pages, checkout pages, fonts, and logos to fit perfectly with your brand. For instance, you can add form fields to collect customer data on the checkout page.\nIf you need a POS system tailored to your needs, Lightspeed is an excellent choice. It has broad features and extensive third-party integration to compensate for features Lightspeed may not offer. The user-friendly interface makes setting up and managing your payment system easy.\nThe drawback is that Lightspeed is relatively expensive, with monthly subscription fees costing $89 to $289. Its standard transaction fee is 2.6% plus 10 cents, which falls within a similar range as most POS systems.\nRead our full Lightspeed review.\nBest POS for small businesses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHelcim is a great option for small businesses because of its affordable hardware costs and transaction fees. It also doesn\u2019t require a monthly or annual subscription, which favors small businesses with limited budgets.\nTransaction fees on Helcim range from 1.8% to 2%, depending on the type of card. Its Smart Terminal hardware costs $329, unlike similar devices from other vendors that cost $500 upwards.\nHelcim has a visually stunning interface, and I don\u2019t say this lightly. Its interface is modern, highly responsive, and easily the best among the POS systems I\u2019ve tested. It incorporates bright, strategically positioned colors that make navigation fun.\nHowever, the tradeoff for Helcim\u2019s affordability is its limited customization and integration. You can\u2019t customize the checkout flow as much as a tool like Lightspeed or Shopify. It has a limited collection of native third-party integrations, so you might need a developer to create yours from scratch via Helcim\u2019s API.\nLikewise, Helcim doesn\u2019t offer as many complementary features as other POS systems on this list. It\u2019s a good POS system for small businesses but unsuitable for large retailers needing tailor-made features.\nRead our full Helcim review.\nBest POS system for value for money\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nI chose Clover because it offers great value for money. It\u2019s an affordable POS solution, and the features you\u2019ll get are worth the price. A basic POS setup costs $15 monthly (after buying the hardware). If you need tailor-made features for restaurants, Clover offers packages ranging from $60 to $90 monthly.\nThe standard transaction fee is 2.6% plus 10 cents, comparable to the other POS systems in this buying guide. You can manage your payments and inventory extensively with Clover.\nIf you have multiple POS devices, Clover lets you monitor them from a unified dashboard and simultaneously change settings across all devices. This easy monitoring favors spas, salons, convenience stores, and other businesses that often have multiple locations.\nClover\u2019s inventory management features are a bright spot. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy to create detailed product inventories and retrieve items when needed. Another bright spot is Clover\u2019s employee management features; you can manage shift requests and track clocked-in periods.\nOther complementary features include an invoicing solution, email marketing, and rapid deposit of customer payments (this service incurs a 1.75% fee). The drawback I observed is that Clover\u2019s hardware systems cost more than the competition.\nRead our full Clover review.\nAlso check out the following POS system reviews:\nLooking for more information on POS systems? Try these articles: Here we advise on how to choose a POS system; this feature explains how a POS system works; and in this article we demonstrate 5 ways POS systems help you manage staff.\nBest POS system FAQs\nIn today's fast moving digital world, your customers have a wide variety of options when it comes to purchasing goods and services. They can use credit and debit cards via magnetic swipe, chip or a contactless tap, Apple Pay and Google Pay via cell phone, third-party online payment providers, digital currencies like Bitcoin, or occasionally just plain old cash.\nWhat's more, people like using digital payment options. A recent study by Mastercard found that 50% of consumers globally prefer these new kinds of payments over cash - a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. With greater flexibility in your point of sale system, you can accept a wider variety of payments, speed up transactions, and improve overall customer satisfaction..\nTherefore, it just makes sense that any modern business should offer the payment options its customers want to use. No one wants to cancel a sale because a customer has to run to an ATM to withdraw cash. Chances are, they're not coming back.\nThese new digital payment-processing technologies can also be leveraged by businesses to better understand customer spending habits, manage inventories of all sizes, and offer practical services like on-floor payment processing and price checking.\nA modern POS system ties all this together and can do wonders for your front-end and back-end operations. We've compared these POS systems using various factors, including their ease of setup, interface, fee rate, support and pricing too. We also evaluated their learning curves, documentation, and hardware requirements, among other things.\nAfter the reviews, we've answered some of the most frequently asked questions about POS and ePOS systems.\nWhat is a POS system?\nA point-of-sale (POS) system is the hardware and software that allows businesses to process payments, manage inventory, and track sales.\nThe core hardware includes card readers or terminals that let customers pay by inserting, swiping, or tapping their cards. Complementary hardware includes receipt printers, barcode scanners, touchscreen displays, etc.\nThe software lets you receive payments from customers\u2019 cards. When you receive a payment, a receipt is automatically generated, which you can print with the receipt printer. The software also lets you manage inventory and generate sales reports.\nPOS systems take different forms: portable, countertop, and mobile. You can choose a portable POS device with built-in software to process payments. This option is best suited for service providers or businesses that often change locations, e.g., attending trade fairs.\nIf your business is at a fixed location, you can choose a countertop terminal to process payments. Countertop systems offer more features and a faster checkout process.\nIf you\u2019re a small business or service provider, you can buy a card reader that connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth or USB-C. The reader is the core hardware, and the software is the POS provider\u2019s app installed on your smartphone.\nThe POS market is very competitive, with a variety of systems designed for retailers, hotels, restaurants, and other business categories. In this buying guide, I curated the best POS systems for different categories.\nHow much does a business POS system cost?\nPrices vary significantly for POS systems. Businesses usually pay a monthly or annual fee for each POS device and a fee on every transaction. However, some POS systems, usually those targeted at small businesses, don\u2019t have subscription fees. They only take transaction fees.\nYou\u2019ll also need to pay for the core hardware, which ranges from $50 for small card readers to $1,000+ for countertop terminals. Likewise, complementary hardware like barcode scanners and receipt printers incur extra costs.\nPricing is crucial when choosing a POS system, especially for businesses with limited budgets. POS systems have varying price points, so there\u2019s no shortage of affordable solutions. Depending on your hardware and desired features, you can always find the best option at a reasonable price.\nBenefits of using a POS system\n1. Efficiency\nPOS systems let you efficiently accept customer payments. You type in the amount the customer should pay, and they can quickly insert, tap, or swipe their card to complete the payment.\nYou can add all items to your POS inventory and add unique barcodes. When a customer picks an item, you\u2019ll quickly scan the barcode to retrieve the price and other details. Your business runs more efficiently when these activities are done automatically rather than manually.\n2. Accurate reporting\nAccurate financial records are a pain point for businesses. Errors often occur when people manually input transaction records from one system to another.\nA POS system sidesteps this problem by automatically recording all transactions for future review. Transactions are recorded immediately after completion, so you\u2019ll get accurate records stretching back years or decades.\nYou can download accurate transaction data in a CSV format and export it to other software systems, such as your accounting and tax management platform. Some POS systems let you generate custom financial reports from transaction data.\n3. Customer experience\nA POS system provides an intuitive shopping experience for your customers. People can walk into your store, pick their items, and pay in a few steps. The POS system makes things seamless for you and the customer, boosting productivity and encouraging repeat sales.\nFactors to consider when choosing a POS system\n1. Type of business\nPOS systems are designed for different types of businesses. For example, Toast is built for restaurants, and Shopify is designed for retailers. Some systems, like GoDaddy, are intended for general-purpose businesses.\nConsider your business category when searching for suitable POS systems. You\u2019re better off with a solution designed for your business niche, though general-purpose solutions can still work.\nFor instance, Toast provides tailor-made features for restaurants that you\u2019ll hardly find in a general-purpose system. Shopify provides features for retailers that aren\u2019t easy to find in general POS solutions. It\u2019s advisable to select a solution designed for your niche, as it\u2019ll make running your business easier.\n2. Third-party integration\nEvaluate integration with third-party apps when choosing a POS system. A POS system won\u2019t offer all your desired features, but third-party tools can fill the gap. Third-party integration adds extra functionalities to your POS system and streamlines business operations.\nFor example, QuickBooks is a popular accounting tool for small businesses. Some POS systems are integrated with QuickBooks, so every transaction will automatically reflect in your accounting records. This integration saves considerable time you would have spent transferring these records manually.\nYou can use third-party integrations to manage discounts, customer loyalty programs, inventory, etc. The broader the integration library of your desired POS system, the better. If a POS system doesn\u2019t have many integrations, it should at least offer API access to let developers create custom integrations.\n3. Customer support\nCustomer support is essential beginning from the setup process. You might need help setting up your point-of-sale system, so a responsive and knowledgeable support team offers great benefits.\nPOS providers usually offer online or in-person assistance during setup, depending on your location. You should have access to online manuals and how-tos about setting up your POS system.\nAfter setting up your POS system, issues that require external help can occasionally arise. Hence, you should be able to contact your POS provider via email, telephone, or live chat to get quick responses. The faster and more knowledgeable the support team, the better.\nCustomer support was a core consideration when curating this buying guide. I tested each POS provider\u2019s customer support and weighed it against other pros and cons. I also researched third-party opinions about each POS provider's support services.\n4. Scalability\nIf you plan to run a fast-growing business, you need a POS system that can easily scale to meet your increasing needs. This factor may sound trivial, but I\u2019ve tested some POS systems that make scaling difficult.\nAdding a new POS device to your account and monitoring the transactions from your dashboard should be easy. Suppose you open a second store location; you should be able to order and set up a new device without hassle. Then, you can monitor transactions and make changes for both devices from your dashboard.\nFor example, many POS systems let you use the same inventory for multiple devices. If a sale is recorded in a device, it\u2019ll reflect on the inventory of all devices. You can also change settings for multiple POS devices from your dashboard. Scalability enables you to run a fast-growing business without running into mundane issues.\n5. Pricing\nPricing is essential when choosing your POS system. You need something within your budget, so compare options to make the best choice.\nPOS systems have wide price ranges, from less than $100 to thousands of dollars for the initial setup and recurring subscription fees. Choosing any vendor is a tradeoff between pricing and your desired features.\nA POS system might be the most affordable but lack your preferred features. In that case, you can forgo the preferred features and use the available ones. Alternatively, you can choose a more expensive option with the preferred features.\nThe good thing is that several POS systems are affordable and provide broad features. These systems offer great value for money, and I\u2019ve included some of them in this buying guide.\n6. User-friendliness\nA user-friendly interface is a key benefit of any POS system. It makes setting up and managing your POS system easy. With an intuitive interface, you can seamlessly switch between different features and juggle third-party integrations. User-friendliness was a priority when curating this guide to the best POS vendors.\nHow many POS terminals do I need?\nThis depends on the size of your business and your daily turnover. For smaller or medium-sized businesses that deal with lower volume, a single payment terminal is usually enough.\nRestaurants may want to invest in multiple handheld payment terminals (or use Apple or Android tablets) to enable payments to be taken at tables by serving staff.\nFor medium-sized businesses dealing with high volume and for larger companies, two or three terminals will be ideal. The best solution is to start with one or two based on your volume and scale up as needed.\nAre all POS systems PCI compliant?\nWhile most, if not all, POS systems are PCI compliant, simply using one doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have to worry about other components of your payment ecosystem. Opting for a POS that manages more details can help streamline the process, but it may be more costly.\nRead our article about PCI compliance to learn more.\nWhat is an mPOS system?\nPOS systems have evolved to become more flexible, so they work on many devices. For example, with nothing but a smartphone and mobile card reader, you can manage payments, refunds, and more.\nMobile point of sale solutions (often called mPOS systems) are especially useful for small businesses and those without a fixed address, like food trucks and personal trainers. But they also represent a great opportunity for fixed businesses looking to leverage pop-up stores, kiosks, and mobile storefronts.\nFor more info, read our article about the best mobile credit card processors.\nWhat is a tablet POS system?\nToday's POS systems are built to work on iPads and Android tablets, which gives you greater flexibility and mobility when securing customer payments.\nYou can choose to have them fixed in place with a stand or to keep them on your person to serve customers, which is a great option for a restaurant or bar.\nTablet POS systems are often the easiest POS devices to use as well, as they\u2019ve been simplified for easier handling on a tablet. You get all the movement benefits of a mobile POS system with a wider screen and more storage space.\nWhat can a modern POS system do for your business?\nProduct Reports\nProduct reporting will help you better manage your stock and find opportunities for growth. Target poorly performing products for improvement or removal, and enact campaigns for the most popular ones.\nUser accounts and permissions\nYour staff doesn\u2019t need access to everything. A POS system with user accounts and most importantly, permission settings will enable employees to perform their duties without you having to worry about them stumbling onto sensitive information.\nMobile features\nMobile hardware, Android and iOS applications, and handy mobile features like bill splitting, Apple and Google Pay compatibility, and receipt emailing can all make it easier for mobile and small businesses to satisfy customers and increase turnover.\nCustomer facing display\nFor retail businesses, this is considered indispensable, and there are many options out there. Modern customer-facing screens are a great opportunity to inform customers and promote campaigns, all while providing a smooth and transparent transaction experience\nCustomer Relationship Management\nAn umbrella term for a host of features and functionalities, CRM enables you to build better and more productive relationships with customers. Contact details and payment history, for example, can be used to keep customers informed of new products that may interest them.\nEmployee tracking and reporting\nStreamline your daily operations with built-in employee clock-in and clock-out capabilities, and find opportunities for employee growth with reporting. Reward high performers and enact training when necessary.\nStock management\nA good stock management system can help you save costs and streamline operations. Many POS support multi-location stock management, enabling you to more quickly respond to stock problems or respond to customer requests.\nLoyalty programmes\nIncluded in CRM but still worthy of mention are loyalty programs, which many businesses have used with great success to boost sales and maintain customer involvement. A POS with strong loyalty program capabilities, as well as the ability to process gift cards, can be well worth the money.\nBulk operations\nGetting started with a new POS doesn\u2019t have to be a headache. POS systems that support bulk operations through CSV import, for example, or integration with third-party apps, will greatly simplify the process.\nThese features make it easier to turn impatient customers into enthusiastic ambassadors for your brand. A good POS can facilitate SRM by streamlining these processes.\nIf you're looking for advice about POS systems for specific type of business, then take a look at our guides to choosing the best POS systems for small business, POS systems for restaurants, and POS systems for retail.\nHow to choose the best POS systems for you?\nWhen deciding which POS system to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as different platforms can offer differing features fee rates. Additionally, you may need a POS with specific tools for your business, so make sure you look carefully at both features and costs to ensure you can get the POS system your business needs.\nThe best POS systems for business compared\nPOS system | Lowest monthly fee | Card rates | Free trial | Support |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nAirPOS | $29.99 | Integrates with iZettle, SumUp, and WorldPay | 14 days | Online form |\nLightspeed | \u00a369 | 2.6% + 10\u00a2 | 14 days | 24-hr phone support (reduced weekend hours) |\nShopify | $29 | 2.7% | 14 days | 24/7 chat support |\n$39 | Integrates with iZettle and others | 30 days | Email support (Pro: 24/7 phone support) | |\n$0 | 2.6% + 10\u00a2 | N/A | Phone and chat support | |\n$69 | Varies, depending on payment provider | Demo sign-up available | Phone, email, help page |\nHow we tested the best POS systems\nWe reviewed many different POS systems before deciding on which to feature in this guide.

      "text": "Best graphic design software of 2025: Top picks tested for creative professionals and beginners\nWe tested out the top graphic design programs for designers and artists\nI reviewed the best graphic design software to find the top programs and apps for creative professionals and beginners who want to bring their creativity to life.\nFirst, it's worth noting that both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are excellent apps, with Photoshop being a great all-rounder for designers, artists, and Illustrator proving adept for hand-drawn designs. When it comes to designing polished and professional imagery for the likes of posters, social media content, or product design, these are peerless apps.\nI'd also strongly recommend checking out Affinity Designer 2, which is easily one of the best Photoshop alternatives for graphic designers and has no on-going subscriptions (just a one off charge). And both Gimp and the very easy-to-use Canva are great free options.\nMy team and I have tested each app in this round up, using the best laptops for graphic design and the best monitors for graphic design to assess the software at a professional design level. As part of this process, we explore interface and creative flow, design tools and features, and image quality of the final exports.\nReader offer: 40% off for the first 6 months on Adobe Photoshop\nAdobe Photoshop is an image editing software, that enables users to enhance digital images with precision and creativity. Its extensive toolset is an asset to professionals to retouch photos, create stunning graphics, and design intricate compositions. Try it for yourself.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nBest graphic design software overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPhotoshop is a byword for graphic design these days. Adobe\u2019s photo and design software dominates the industry - and with good reason. Setting the gold standard for design work and photo editing, its toolkit is bursting with features, and it's even available on iPhones now.\nWhen we reviewed the top tool, we found it offered best-in-class color management, layer handling, and selection tools, with AI automating a raft of effects from cleaning up images to object removal. After reviewing the software, we ultimately felt that from subject selection to object removal, Adobe\u2019s AI tools offer impressive performance that effectively streamlines the more mundane or manual design tasks.\nWhile Photoshop isn\u2019t too tricky to learn, there is a slight learning curve that may overwhelm new users. Stick with it though, and you\u2019ll be more than rewarded with high-quality, high-res results. It also means you\u2019ll be familiar with other Adobe apps in the creative toolstack, since they largely follow the same interface.\nAdobe Photoshop is an ongoing subscription-only service. Getting it on its own will cost you around $20 a month, but if you intend to incorporate four or more Adobe apps into your workflow, the Creative Cloud Pro plan would represent better value, only setting you back $70 a month on a yearly contract.\nRead our full Adobe Photoshop review .\nBest subscription-free graphic design software\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSerif Affinity Designer 2 is primarily a vector-based graphic design software for Mac, Windows, and iPad, although it does also possess a powerful array of raster-type tools.\nPrevious updates focused on the vector side of Designer, introducing powerful and highly requested features, such as a Shape Builder, various Warp tools, and many others. There's plenty going on here, with tools like variable fonts, the ability to alter the stroke\u2019s width and position by dragging points along it, and you can even create QR codes, which will be useful for poster designers.\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised at how easy and intuitive such powerful features were to use, adding flexibility and versatility to an already impressive app.\nWe would argue that Designer has enough tools in its arsenal to be considered a potential Adobe Illustrator alternative, especially considering its highly impressive cost: a one-off $70 for the computer version, and $18.50 for iPad.\nRead our full Affinity Designer 2 review.\nBest free graphic design software\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCanva is an ideal solution for designers and non-designers creating branded assets - an impressively easy-to-use graphic design app that largely relies on dragging, dropping, and resizing vector graphics. It's still one I use regularly for those quick designs and edits that don't require the full power of Photoshop or Affinity.\nThe beauty of Canva is in its simple execution. Whether you\u2019re a skilled artist or you\u2019ve never opened Photoshop in your life, you have the tools to create incredibly professional-looking graphics to boost your online presence, promote your brand, and more. There are plenty of templates for fast creation that can be fully customized to fit your branding. Little wonder it\u2019s become a firm favorite in marketing departments where the demand to create a lot of high-end visual content fast is a necessity.\nThis is as much a content marketing tool as it is a design app, and under the hood you\u2019ll find a simple video maker, website builder, logo maker, PDF maker, and more. Each is a delight to use - so long as you temper expectations: this is graphic design streamlined and online, so it lacks advanced tools for precise or very complex designs.\nUse the left-hand sidebar to find the assets you want - from illustrations to stock photos and videos, or upload your own media. Brand-conscious organisations may want to opt for the Canva Pro subscription, which unlocks the Brand Kit, starting at $120 per year, ensuring design consistency across all creations.\nRead our full Canva review .\nBest graphic design software for illustrators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAdobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design program that's stable in use and absolutely packed with features for graphic design work at all levels.\nWe were impressed with the range of improvements Adobe has made here; it's pretty simple to identify and edit fonts in any image, create realistic mockups on template 3D objects, and work with projects online. The excellent Firefly AI tools are also, as with Photoshop, a nice way to quickly create images and objects with effective results. During our own tests, we found the AI was well-integrated into Illustrator. While your mileage may vary, we found the results to be pretty impressive.\nLike most Adobe apps, Illustrator is available via a standalone subscription ($23 a month), and also comes bundled into the Creative Cloud Pro plan ($70 a month), which is a useful option if you're also using many other Adobe software, such as Photoshop, Lightroom, InDesign, etc.\nRead our full Adobe Illustrator review.\nBest graphic design software for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCorelDRAW can be purchased either on its own, or as part of the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite bundle. That package also includes PHOTO-PAINT for image manipulation, PowerTRACE to convert bitmap images into vectors, CorelDRAW Web, an online version of the main attraction, and Font Manager for organising the font families you actually use.\nThe main star, of course, is CorelDRAW itself, which isn't just a vector-drawing package but also includes a desktop publishing feature as well, enabling you to create multi-page projects.\nThe newest version includes an update to the Painterly Brush tool, and a new Pantone colour palette. Elsewhere, you'll find pixel-based brushes and creative templates, streamlined fonts and non-destructive effects workflows. In addition to these, is the ability to easily search through your images as thumbnails.\nOverall, CorelDRAW, whether on its own or as part of the suite, offers a big range of tools that remain very up-to-date. You\u2019ll find the suite is the same price as the individual app, so getting the former is a no brainer. Even better, Corel offers you the choice of either owning the package for $549, or subscribing for $22/42 per month.\nThe company has also released CorelDRAW Go, an online graphic design tool that in my experience works a lot like Canva or Adobe Express.\nRead our full CorelDRAW review.\nBest free Adobe Illustrator alternative\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMost business people often shy away from free software for valid reasons, but Inkscape is certainly worth looking at before you commit to buying CorelDRAW or one of a myriad of Adobe subscriptions.\nInkscape is a vector design tool that offers broad file support, extensive text manipulation, and both Bezier and Spiro curve types. It also has an extension model that allows new features to be easily installed, and there are some amazing ones available.\nThe only reservations we have are that even on a powerful PC, this software can be slow at times when a complicated process involves rendering.\nAs a GPL-licensed app, along with Windows, Linux, and Apple Mac versions, you can also download the source code and compile it for whatever version of Linux you are using.\nRead our full Inkscape review.\nBest graphic design software for UI\n7. Sketch\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRather than the scatter-gun approach of other applications, the creators of Sketch built a tool to address a relatively narrow requirement.\nSketch is focused on screen design, specifically creating the icons and interface elements for websites and applications. And, as the software is exclusively available for the Apple Mac, most designers working on iPhone, iPad and macOS applications are going to find it useful.\nThat said, it can be used more generally, but its strength is creating slick user interfaces. Sketch is one of the best UI tools in the market and it offers a brilliant, minimalist user experience with its intuitive keyboard shortcuts and smooth running. It also boasts a vast library of Sketch Plugins and is quite feature-rich.\nSketch is available as a solo designer license for $120, or as a standard subscription for $10 per editor a month, billed yearly (or $12 billed monthly).\nBest graphic design software for Windows\n8. Xara Designer Pro X\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe company behind Xara started out on the Atari ST and Acorn Archimedes computers in the 1980s, before focusing its efforts on the PC when Windows came along.\nThe latest version of Xara Designer Pro X is a comprehensive design tool that can work with both bitmaps and vectors with equal aplomb. That means it can handle DTP (desktop publishing), graphic design, illustration and photo manipulation tasks in a single tool.\nFor those wanting to mock up something rapidly, a subscription gives you access to over a million archive photos and illustrations to incorporate, along with hundreds of template layouts and thousands of design elements, for $16 a month (billed annually).\nBest graphic design software: Frequently asked questions\nWhat is graphic design software?\nGraphic design is the creation and arrangement of visuals in a project to convey ideas or messages. Graphic design tools or software enable users to work on various aspects of design \u2014 from vector graphics and photo manipulation to color editing, color correction, and much more.\nWhat is vector Illustration?\nWe put the question to Klaus Vossen, Senior Product Manager for CorelDraw . So what exactly is a vector and vector illustration and how does it differ from a bitmap.\nLet\u2019s start with Vector vs. Bitmap. Bitmaps, also known as raster images, are created using pixels, which are small dots of color. Think photographs! And while bitmap images are essential to any design workflow, it\u2019s important to know that they can vary tremendously in terms of size and image quality \u2013 unfortunately running the risk of becoming blurry when enlarged.\nOn the other hand, vector images are made up of points, lines, and shapes that can be edited to precise detail, and because they\u2019re based on mathematical equations they can be scaled indefinitely to any size. Extremely versatile, a single vector image, let\u2019s say a logo, can be printed anywhere from the corner of an envelope to a roadside billboard \u2013 all using the same original file.\nSo now that we know what a vector file is, it\u2019s easy to understand why they\u2019re so important to a graphics workflow. And while there are plenty of apps that offer vector illustration tools, if you want professional results with high-quality output, you need professional software.\nWhat's the difference between vector and raster?\nVector and raster graphics are both essential for digital designers, artists, and creatives - but what are the differences between the two? Vector graphics are 'resolution independent'. This means the graphics, built from lines, points, and curves, use mathematical equations to let you resize vector graphics without seeing a drop in quality. Raster graphics are made from pixels, which means they can look good at their intended size, but scaling up the image and maintaining quality isn't possible. There are pros and cons to using both.\nWe explore the differences in our guide to vector vs. raster. For a deeper dive into vectors, see vector graphics explained.\nHow to choose the best graphic design software\nWhen deciding which of the best graphic design software to download and use, first consider how serious and professional you need the software to be.\nIf you are only looking to make simple designs and files then you have the option to be less fussy about which program you use.\nHowever, if you plan to develop anything for professional printing, it may be better to aim for one of the higher range and more expensive programs on our list.\nYou'll also want to consider the capabilities of your computer. Most vector editors and design apps aren't especially resource-intensive, but you will want one with a color-accurate screen and good graphics to ensure your on-screen artwork precisely matches the final version. Alternatively, if you prefer to work on the go, the best drawing tablets and the best laptops for drawing and digital art may better suit your creative workflow.\nFor more software ideas, we've also tested out the best free Adobe Illustrator vector alternatives.\nHow we test the best graphic design software\nWe've tested a range of graphic design apps, including the best desktop publishing software, best logo makers, and the best free logo makers.\nTo test for the best graphic design software, we first set up an account with a range of different software platforms, either as a download or as an online service. We then tested it using a handful of images to see how the software could be used for the editing and development of each image.\nThe aim was to push each software platform to see whether it could simply and easily not just edit a range of content types but also do so faithfully and consistently without introducing formatting issues or similar problems that would make them useless for printing purposes.\nWe tested the best Adobe InDesign alternatives - here's what we recommend for creative magazine making\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Once upon a time, brands knew that the majority of their sales would come from their brick-and-mortar stores, but then came an explosion in the best ecommerce platforms, with many many retailers now generating a significant proportion of their sales online. The ubiquity of smartphones has only added further complexity to the sales pipeline.\nGiven the disparate channels that sales now take place through, the multichannel lead management functionality provided by Zoho is a godsend.

This means that even when an organization settles on a particular piece of business software, it\u2019s highly likely that other tools will be required. Today, it\u2019s more of a technology ecosystem that businesses rely on, rather a single tool.\nPipedrive is a case in point. Although the Pipedrive platform itself is an impressive piece of sales pipeline software, it really comes into its own once you start exploring the impressive list of add-ons that are available. For example, the platform\u2019s LeadBooster add-on incorporates quality inbound and outbound leads into your sales pipeline.

There\u2019s also lead scoring driven by Salesforce\u2019s built-in Einstein.ai functionality. This collects data on your activity and deals, before assigning predictive scores to each of your leads. This allows your sales agents to more effectively prioritize their time, only focusing on the leads that are most likely to convert. Other features include opportunity management, sales forecasting, reporting dashboards, and more.\nThere are four different pricing plans available for businesses to choose between. Although Salesforce may not be the cheapest sales management software available, the many features on offer combined with an intuitive interface make this an easy pick as our number one.\nRead our full Salesforce Sales Cloud review.\nBest advanced sales management software\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nA big part of managing the sales process is simply getting all your contacts in order. One of the sales management tools that really excels in this area is Freshsales, which is particularly great at providing firms with a clear overview of their customer data in a single place. This sales data can then be quickly segmented depending on customer demographics, prior conversations or other characteristics.\nThere\u2019s also some compelling advanced functionality on show here. For instance, AI-based lead scoring helps sales teams to automate sales prospecting, find quality leads more efficiently, increase conversion rates, and close deals faster. Lead scoring is customizable and always backed by a range of data sources.\nIn fact, the customization on offer throughout Freshsales CRM is another reason why this software stands out as a great sales management tool. All aspects of the CRM\u2019s interface can be customized, including the main navigation menu, the language, custom fields, sales activities, and more. This means that Freshsales is highly malleable to any business, regardless of size or industry.\nAlthough Freshsales does offer fewer third-party integrations than many of its competitors, it does come with comprehensive contact and account management tools, in-built phone and email functionality, and an impressive mobile app. The latter, in particular, is sure to appeal to businesses that have sales agents that enjoy a hybrid or remote working environment.\nRead our full Freshsales review.\nBest free sales management software\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAlthough there is a plethora of solutions that could reasonably lay a claim to being the best sales management tool on the market, there\u2019s only one that could justify its inclusion in that list by virtue of its free plan. That\u2019s Hubspot, which has long been recognized as one of the best free CRM software packages on the market today.\nAlthough Hubspot does offer a paid plan, starting with its Professional tier (costing $450/month) you might first want to explore the impressive functionality included in Hubspot\u2019s free tier. This covers all the basics that you might expect from a sales management tool, including contact management, call and email logs, deal pipelines, and integrations with third-party apps like Slack and Gmail.\nThe free-forever plan offered comes with a shared inbox feature to keep all your incoming email and live chat correspondence in one place. This means you can keep all your communication with customers and prospects in a unified place that is easily accessed by your entire sales team.\nThe free version also comes with the option of adding a support form and tracking code to your website, which is especially useful for ecommerce businesses. This functionality allows businesses to gain added visibility into what actions are being taken by website visitors and capture their details. This allows brands to capture valuable insights that could inform their next sales process.\nAlthough it is true that there is a big jump to the starting paid plan, it does unlock some added functionality like the option of adding five users, accessing a product library, forecasting tools, and an eSignature feature. If the price is a little steep, however, businesses can always stick with the free version, which still represents a highly impressive sales management tool.\nRead our full HubSpot CRM review.\nBest sales management software for simplicity\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMonday Sales CRM is a CRM platform ideally suited for small to mid-sized enterprises, assisting sales and marketing heads in team management. Known for its user-friendly interface, it provides a range of tools aimed at handling the customer journey. The software is also flexible and can be adjusted to meet your specific needs.\nNoteworthy features of Monday Sales CRM include email synchronization, which allows the dispatch and receipt of emails, note-taking during meetings, and displaying all communications on a single timeline. Furthermore, its core feature of managing contacts helps to organize clients and potential clients' information into a single database, which supports unlimited contacts. Email support is also provided, complete with templates that save time by automatically filling in personalized emails.\nAutomation is a further useful feature. Businesses can find value with the ability to develop customized workflows to eliminate administrative tasks and streamline communication, but this does require a plan higher than the entry level one. However, keep in mind that unless you upgrade to a higher plan, the number of activities is restricted to 250 per seat each month.\nThe four tiers of Monday CRM range from the entry-level Basic CRM, to the Enterprise plan, which may be fully customized for a higher cost. Additionally, keep in mind that each plan must have a minimum of 3 seats, which lessens the appeal of this for a solo business.\nWhile there's no free tier, you can try it out for free for two weeks. Plus, you can get 18% off your subscription if you pay once a year, or if you'd prefer to pay monthly, you can do that too.\nRead our full Monday Sales CRM review.\nBest sales management software for streamlining\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAlthough boosting your conversion rate is essential, another important function of sales management software is streamlining the sales pipeline. This greatly improves the efficiency of each sales, giving agents more time to work on adding value and collaborating with other team members. This is something that many businesses are enjoying as a result of using Bitrix24.\nWith Bitrix, you can automate workflows and even monitor the activities of your sales personnel so you can quickly identify bottlenecks and new areas for optimization. You can build custom sales pipelines specific to your products and there\u2019s also a useful mobile app that provides a breakdown of your sales results and lets you track KPIs.\nAlthough Bitrix\u2019s user interface is not the easiest to get to grips with, once you do it provides all the functionality you need to speed up your sales pipeline. The addition of some chatbots woud be an easy way to ease support and troubleshooting, but if you\u2019re already pretty confident with CRMs, then this could be the sales management software you need to supercharge the productivity of your sales team.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review here.\nBest sales management software for interface\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe robust functionality of some sales management tools may be all well and good, but it\u2019s not much use if you need a Ph.D. in computer science to understand what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s why having a clear, intuitive user interface is a huge advantage - and somewhere that Pipedrive outdoes most of its competitors.\nMuch of the unnecessary screen clutter is absent here with Pipedrive focusing on a streamlined, customizable pipeline built upon clear visualizations of each of your leads. You can create any number of reporting dashboards, as well as custom reports, so Pipedrive\u2019s output is exactly how you want it to be. It\u2019s also possible to export data to Excel if you want to access the analytical features within Microsoft\u2019s flagship spreadsheet program.\nFor larger businesses managing a sizeable number of leads, Pipedrive\u2019s interface is equally straightforward, allowing organizations to set automatic alerts and reminders so nothing falls through the gaps. It\u2019s also easy to update your sales forecast whenever you progress through a deal.\nWhile there is no free version of Pipedrive, there is a 14-day trial allowing you to explore its features without committing financially. Given its ease of use, this trial period should give you plenty of time to dive straight in and come to a decision on whether Pipedrive is the right sales management software for your business.\nRead our full Pipedrive CRM review.\nWe also list the best sales enablement software.\nBest sales management software FAQs\nWhich sales management software is right for you?\nThis is undoubtedly a question that is difficult to answer but one that could hardly be more important. Finding the best sales management software could be the difference between business success and failure, allowing firms to streamline their sales pipeline, boost the productivity of their agents, uncover new consumer trends, and gain a competitive advantage.\nSales ultimately determine the revenue and profitability of a business but what the above tools do particularly well is recognize that most sales are long-term endeavors. Applying data to customer interactions, businesses can determine how best to communicate with prospects and convert leads. The right sales management tool for you will likely depend on your budget and industry segment, but one of the above tools should fit the bill.\nHow we tested the best sales management software\nWhen we review sales management software, we look at indicators including feature set, interface and ease of use, plans and pricing, and support options.\nA high level of automation capability in managing leads, deals, and workflow is an example feature that could contribute towards a high score. Another important strength would be a desktop and mobile interface allowing quick, intuitive access to basic features.\nWe look at pricing plans and competitors to check whether higher subscription prices are warranted by features you can\u2019t find elsewhere in the market, or whether a good deal could benefit those with lower budgets.\nGenerous customer support options are also prioritized, especially for sales management software which may come with a steep learning curve.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best AI chatbot for business of 2025\nSupport your customers with AI\nWe list the best AI chatbots for business, to make it simple and easy to provide online support for customers and staff using AI chatbots.\nArtificial intelligence is one of the greatest technological developments of this century. You may have heard of ChatGPT, the famous artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, an American software company. ChatGPT was released in November 2022 and amassed millions of users in a short while. It\u2019s arguably the most famous AI product, but many chatbots have existed before it, including those built for businesses.\nAI chatbots are an innovative customer support solution for businesses. They don\u2019t replace human support but instead, help solve simple issues, while human support representatives focus on the more complex issues.\nThere are many AI chatbot platforms you can adopt for your business. These platforms take away the stress involved in setting up your chatbot to interact with customers. They take care of the complex technical aspects of running a chatbot, while you focus on the simpler things. They save a lot of money compared to hiring developers to train and build your own chatbot.\nWe tested different AI chatbot platforms to identify the best ones for businesses. We considered essential factors including speed, scalability, third-party integrations, and ease of use. They each have their pros and cons but, overall, are the best chatbots you can adopt for your business.\nWe also listed the best live chat software.\nThe best AI chatbot for business of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest AI chatbot for ease of use\n1. Botsify\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBotsify is another simple-to-use AI chatbot platform. Its main proposition is for businesses to build customer support bots or bots to automate their sales processes.

You can let customers book meetings and purchase products via the bots. There are endless applications.\nBotsify is relatively affordable. It starts at $49 per month for unlimited conversations but with a limit of 5k users. A higher plan costs $149 per month and supports unlimited users and conversations. There\u2019s no free version, but you can take advantage of the 14-day free trial to test Botsify\u2019s features before making your final decision.\nBest AI chatbot for customer support\n2. Intercom\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIntercom is a software company specializing in customer support and business messaging tools. One of its main products is a tool that lets businesses develop chatbots powered by artificial intelligence.\nYou can use Intercom's chatbot tool to develop bots without writing a single line of code. Intercom is a customer support platform, so the main use case for its chatbot tool is building customer support bots. You can define keywords and automatic responses for the bots to give to customers. This platform incorporates artificial intelligence, so it speaks in a conversational tone that customers would like.\nSimilarly, you can use Intercom bots to interact with potential customers and collect lead information from them. This platform lets you automate simple business conversations and frees up time to focus on the more complex ones.\nIntercom's pricing strategy isn't straightforward. The price you'll pay depends on several factors including the number of chatbots and the volume of conversations. Customer reviews often note that the platform is expensive.\nBest AI chatbot for social media\n3. Chatfuel\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nChatfuel is an AI chatbot platform with a simple proposition; build bots to interact with customers and embed them on your website or social media pages. The platform gives you a collection of pre-built chatbot templates that you can use as the foundation for yours. You can find templates across different categories; real estate, restaurant, e-commerce, healthcare, beauty, etc.\nYou can pick any template and edit it to fit your tastes. If you have the time and skills, you\u2019re free to create your own chatbot from scratch on Chatfuel.\nChatfuel lets you create chatbots via a graphical user interface instead of codes. You can define keywords for questions you expect your customer to ask and provide automated answers. If your bot notices the keywords, then it\u2019ll reply just the way you instructed it to. If the bot doesn\u2019t understand the question, it can forward the message to a human to take it further.\nAfter creating a Chatfuel bot, you can embed it on your website. Alternatively, you can connect it to your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp business pages, and customers can interact with the bot on these platforms.\nChatfuel is relatively affordable, with plans starting from $15 per month for 500 conversations.\nBest AI chatbot for WhatsApp\n4. Landbot\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLandbot offers a no-code chatbot builder that anyone can use. You can create bots without writing code but, instead, use conditional logic. Landbot already gives you a collection of pre-built templates that you can edit to create your chatbot. These templates take away a lot of the stress that would come from creating your own bot from scratch.\nYou can deploy your Landbot chatbot on your website or WhatsApp business page. Landbot has extensive integration with WhatsApp, making it easy for customers to converse with your business on the messaging platform they know best. It supports over 60 languages, so you can connect with customers across the globe.\nLandbot doesn\u2019t have integration with other social platforms apart from WhatsApp, which puts it at a disadvantage. We also observed complaints of the company\u2019s customer support being lax and needing improvement.\nBest AI chatbot for advanced features\n5. Kore.ai\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKore.ai is a popular conversational AI platform. It gives businesses a platform to build advanced chatbots to interact with customers. The Kore.ai bot builder lets you build chatbots via a graphical user interface instead of codes that only people with advanced technical skills can understand.\nYou can build your custom virtual assistant via a drag-and-drop interface as if you're using a website builder. Kore.ai has a built-in conversation designer that enables your chatbot to mimic human-like tones. It generates automated replies based on previous conversations, and you can make final tweaks before deploying the chatbot. During development, you can always test your chatbot via a mock screen to see how it'll work with end users.\nYou can brand your virtual assistant to make it look professional. You can add your logos and images and change the design to fit the colors of your brand.\nA drawback of using this platform is its high costs. It starts at 20 cents per conversation, plus 10 cents per conversation for pre-built apps, and 4 cents per minute for voice automation. This can add up to a significant amount if you have many customers that\u2019ll need support at some point.\nWe've listed the best help desk software.\nBest AI chatbot for business FAQs\nHow to choose an AI chatbot\nCost\nCost is the first consideration when adopting any software. High-quality AI chatbots aren\u2019t usually cheap but you can shop for the most affordable solution depending on your budget. This ensures you don\u2019t run into future pricing problems that\u2019ll disrupt your business.\nChannel support\nWhat channels does your AI chatbot support? Most chatbots will be embeddable on your website, but that\u2019s not the only needed channel. How about your social media pages? Does it integrate with Facebook, Telegram, Twitter, and other popular social media platforms? Does it integrate with SMS? A good chatbot should support many communication channels.\nEase of use\nIt should be easy to navigate the platform when building your chatbot. It should have an interactive web-based tool for designing and setting parameters for the chatbot. If you're not satisfied with what you've created, you should be able to restart the development process and build on previously developed components.\nSpeed (response time)\nWe can\u2019t overstate the importance of response time for a chatbot. Customers don\u2019t have time to waste, so your chatbot must respond to them as quickly as possible. It shouldn\u2019t just respond quickly in vain but should provide relevant answers to their questions.\nWhat are the essential features of an AI chatbot?\nConversational tone\nThe chatbot should speak in a conversational tone with users. It should sound as human-like as possible instead of a robot giving bland answers. A conversational tone encourages people to continue communicating with the chatbot to get their needed answers instead of requesting human support immediately.\nAccuracy\nThe chatbot should give accurate information when prompted. Giving wrong answers will make your customers frustrated and abandon the conversation. Ideally, the chatbot should recognize when it can\u2019t provide an accurate answer to questions and forward the conversation to a human support representative who can do that.\nAnalytics\nYou should be able to analyze how customers are interacting with the chatbot and identify what needs improvements. What is the most popular question? What topics did users engage with that made them frequently ask for a human agent? What percentage of people interact with the bot from their PC or mobile? Etc.\nThird-party integration\nThe bot should have integrations with third-party enterprise software tools. For example, you can integrate your bot with the Microsoft Teams video-conferencing software to enable people to interact with it while on calls or integrate the bot with Slack so that people can talk to it within the app.\nHow we tested the best AI chatbot for business\nTo test for the best AI chatbot for business we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, then we tested the service to see how the chatbot could be used in a range of different situations. The aim was to push each AI chatbot to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced options.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best Linux distro for developers of 2025\nLinux for versatile programming\nWe list the best Linux distros for developers, to make it simple and easy for coders and programmers of all levels of experience to develop their projects in secure environments.\nWhile Linux has a reputation for being primarily for coders and programmers, over the past couple of decades there have been moves to provide versions of Linux that are more friendly to ordinary users, such as by providing more of a graphic user interface (GUI) and be less reliant on command line use.\nHowever, at its core, Linux still offers a thriving environment for coders and developers. This is increasingly important, because Linux powers the backbone of the internet, mobile devices, and now cloud computing systems. Therefore it's often essential for techies to be able to work directly in a Linux environment, especially for operating servers and for developing software that runs on them.\nWe have reviewed some of the most popular Linux distros for developers, looking at their core structure, the tools and apps they ship with, overall stability, and lots more.\nHere then, are the best Linux operating systems that will help you create your custom programming and development workstation.\nWe've also featured the best Linux training providers and online courses, and the best Linux distros for power users.\nThe best Linux distros for developers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest Arch-based Linux distro for developers\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nArch is a powerful distro that can be used to create a customized environment. However, installing the distro is notoriously laborious. You can escape the installation and still experience the best that Arch has to offer using Manjaro Linux. With the help of a whole set of custom tools and utilities, Manjaro takes the pain out of installing and administering an Arch-based system.\nManjaro is available in multiple editions with different desktop environments. If you are a Qt developer, you can use the KDE edition of the distro, which ships with tools such as the Qt Designer and Qt Assistant to help you with your development.\nManjaro claims the distro ships with tools required to compile and develop software for other developers as well. According to the project\u2019s website you can use Manjaro\u2019s intuitive package manager to easily install IDEs like Qt Creator, KDevelop or Netbeans and libraries like libnoise, boost, or matplotlib. Of course, in addition to its own repositories, you can also access the comprehensive Arch User Repository (AUR) which houses all sorts of tools and libraries.\nRead our full Manjaro review.\nBest all-rounder Linux distro for developers\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUbuntu is one of the most popular Linux distros for all kinds of users, from Linux newbies to seasoned campaigners. For programmers, the Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) release provides a stable development environment that they don\u2019t need to upgrade every six months.\nIn fact, Ubuntu is the chosen distro of the Android Open Source Project for building source files. The Android build is regularly tested using the most recent versions of Ubuntu. The distro\u2019s official website hosts several tutorials, guides, and other resources aimed to impress the development and programming prowess of the distro.\nOwing to its popularity, you can find virtually all the development and programming tools and libraries in official Ubuntu repositories or in a Personal Package Archive (PPA). With the introduction of the snap packaging format, installing new software is a straightforward process.\nFurthermore, Ubuntu has a developer friendly command-line tool called Ubuntu Make that you can use to download several developer friendly tools.\nRead our full Ubuntu review.\nBest Linux distro for developers for older PCs\n3. Puppy Linux\nReasons to buy\nPuppy Linux is an extremely lightweight distro that has separate editions based on Ubuntu and Slackware. The entire OS is small enough to be run entirely in RAM, which makes it extremely fast and responsive. You can also anchor the distro to your hard disk as well.\nDespite its small size, there\u2019s no beating Puppy for out of the box functionality. The distro ships with apps and utilities for virtually all the functions you can perform on a desktop.\nThere are multiple mechanisms for installing apps in Puppy. One of the most convenient ones involves SFS (SquashFS) files, which are compressed environments that package one or more apps and all their required dependencies. If you want to develop on Puppy you can use the devx SFS file that contains various development and build tools.\nFurthermore, the Puppy Linux wiki has a nice introduction to programming, which is a good starting point for new developers. The page also shows you how to install support for over a dozen programming languages in your Puppy installation.\nBest Linux distro for developers for stability\n4. Solus\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSolus is special in that it's one of the few Irish Linux distros, and also because it follows a curated rolling release model. The advantage of this is that once you've installed the OS, you can keep running updates rather than a major upgrade. Solus, however, tries to avoid installing extremely recent packages and beta software to maintain system stability.\nThe distro advertises its use as an ideal environment for developers. Solus supports several editors and IDEs such as Atom, Idea and Gnome Builder, as well as multiple version control systems including Git, Bazaar, and others through graphical tools like GitKraken and git-cola. The Solus project website also claims that the OS supports a number of programming languages such as Go, Rust, PHP, Node.js and Ruby.\nSo while the distro might not ship with very many tools out of the book, you can easily flesh it out with your development toolchain to create a custom Linux distro for your programming needs.\nBest Linux distro for developers for Gentoo users\n5. MocaccinoOS\nReasons to buy\nIn simple terms, Mocaccino is to Gentoo, what Manjaro is to Arch Linux. Gentoo is a source-based meta distro that can help you create lightning quick bloat-free installation. The catch however is that just like Arch, installing Gentoo isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. The Sabayon Linux takes the best of Gentoo and wraps it in an easy to consume distro that caters to all kinds of users.\nMocaccino Linux is available in multiple editions, based on different desktop environments. The project aims to deliver a fuller out of the box experience and despite being a bleeding edge rolling release, is pretty stable thanks to its Gentoo underpinnings. The project is about to merge with Funtoo, which is led by the original creator of Gentoo Linux.\nMocaccino Linux ships with a few development tools, particularly for Python developers, but you can install more using Gentoo\u2019s famed portage package management system.\nBest evergreen Linux distro for developers\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDebian is one of the oldest Linux distros and is built with stability in mind. All programs included with Debian have to meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines. Packages are carefully selected and tested for inclusion in the 'Stable' branch of Debian meaning that while some may be dated, there's very little chance of system instability, making this OS ideal for programmers.\nThe Debian website has extensive manuals, including a chapter on programming talking you through the basics of creating a script, compiling it, and using Autoconf to allow your scripts to be compiled on other Linux distros.\nFurthermore, Debian boasts one of the largest repositories of open source software, so you won't have much trouble finding and installing your favorite programming tools and libraries.\nIf you need a rock-solid production system, or even a desktop you're happy to tinker with, there's no better base than Debian. These solid credentials earn it a place on our list of best Linux distros for developers.\nRead our full Debian review.\nBest Linux distro for developers for enterprise\n7. CentOS Stream\nReasons to buy\nCentOS Stream is a free, community-based variant of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It\u2019s a rolling release distro that\u2019s built using the same packages as RHEL. As a testbed for the commercial RHEL, CentOS Stream gets packages and fixes before they end up in RHEL, which means users can get enterprise-class software at no-cost.\nCentOS Stream thinks of itself as a \u201cdeveloper-forward\u201d distro that\u2019ll help users keep pace with the latest technologies in the open source ecosystem, while ensuring the stability of a well-tested distro.\nThe CentOS Stream distro was visualized as an upstream development platform for distro developers, which means its repositories are flush with apps and tools that will help you set up your ideal development platform, especially once you enable the new PowerTools repository.\nWe've featured the best Linux distros for small business.\nBest Linux distro for developers for programming\nReasons to buy\nFedora Workstation boldly claims it is \u201ccreated for developers\u201d. The distro is another community supported derivative of the commercial RHEL, that\u2019s more bleeding edge than CentOS Stream. It also enjoys the distinction of being the distro of choice of Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds.\nAside from being very easy to set up and install, Fedora has a dedicated Developer Portal. Simply click 'Start a Project' to see dedicated guides on developing web, command line, desktop and mobile apps. There's also an excellent section on working with hardware devices such as Arduino.\nIf this wasn\u2019t enough, the Fedora repositories also include Eclipse, a fully featured and multi-language IDE. Eclipse is probably best known for Java, but also has a C/C++ and PHP IDE. You can expand its functionality even further with plugins.\nRead our full Fedora review.\nBest Linux distro for developers for choice\n9. openSUSE\nReasons to buy\nopenSUSE doesn\u2019t receive the same amount of attention as Ubuntu and Fedora, but the project produces a fantastic Linux distro for developers. The openSUSE project produces two distros; openSUSE Leap is the fixed release cycle regular distro, while openSUSE Tumbleweed is the rolling release variant.\nYou can use either of the two distros depending on the kind of development you\u2019re involved in. Both distros use openSUSE\u2019s excellent YaST configuration and installation tool, which helps you tailor the installation as per your requirements.\nIt's aimed primarily at developers and system admins, with a focus on providing a stable platform; a goal the developers have approached by using source code from SUSE Linux enterprise.\nThe latest versions of openSUSE can be run within the Windows 11 environment, although this isn't something we'd recommend for beginners.\nWe've featured the best Linux distros for Windows users.\nBest Linux distro for developers for Raspberry Pi\n10. Raspberry Pi OS\nReasons to buy\nRaspberry Pi was conceptualized as a cheap computer to help make learning programming accessible to everyone. The Raspberry Pi OS (formerly known as Raspbian) puts that objective into action by bundling a desktop that\u2019s tailored for coding.\nThe distro is complimented by the Raspberry Pi website that hosts some impressive guides on using the credit-card sized computer to learn to program, particularly with Python. The Raspberry Pi OS includes the visual programming tool Scratch, which is a wonderful source for taking first steps into programming.\nYounger coders might prefer to learn to use the programming language for Minecraft Pi, a mini-version of the highly popular sandbox game.\nIt's not all education and programming with the Pi; the latest iteration of the Raspberry Pi can now be used as a very capable computer and the distro developers have ensured that it performs flawlessly with popular video conferencing software such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.\nWe've also featured the best Linux laptops.\nBest Linux distro for developers FAQs\nHow to choose the best Linux distro for developers for you\nMany of the best Linux distros for developers are built on the framework of more established, general-purpose distros. For example, if you already have experience using RHEL, CentOS or Fedora could be a natural next step for your programming needs.\nIf you have a specific use case in mind, you'll find a selection of distros that cater to that need specifically. Lightweight distros are great for older computers while the Raspberry Pi OS would be a natural choice for Raspberry Pi development.\nHow we tested the best Linux distro for developers\nWhere possible, we install each Linux distro to give you an accurate review based on first-hand experience.

      "text": "The path to Agentic AI: overcoming complexity to embrace the autonomous enterprise\nEmpowering enterprise operations with autonomous AI agents\nThe future of enterprise AI isn\u2019t just about insights \u2013 it\u2019s about a monumental evolution of how businesses buy and sell in the global economy.\nAI agents are poised to take automation beyond any capabilities that we\u2019ve witnessed to date, shifting from AI tools that assist decision-making to independently thinking entities that augment execution at scale.\nDeloitte predicts that by 2027, half of all companies will use GenAI to launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept, marking a significant transformation in how businesses operate.\nCTO and Co-Founder, Icertis.\nChallenges on the Path to Agentic Adoption\nWhile agentic AI holds immense promise, organizations must first overcome multiple hurdles. Case in point: Another recent survey found that more than 85 percent of enterprises will require upgrades to their existing technology stack in order to deploy AI agents. Most businesses are still in the early stages of AI adoption, and scaling agentic workflows from initial investments to drive enterprise-wide ROI remains a major challenge.\nThe road to agentic AI requires rethinking IT infrastructure, ensuring seamless and quality data integration, addressing security and compliance risks, and fostering organizational trust in autonomous solutions \u2013 all while ensuring the right guardrails are in place. Without a well-defined strategy, companies risk inefficiencies, implementation barriers, reputational risk, and missed opportunities to harness AI's full potential.\nComplexity in Scaling\nAgents individually aren\u2019t enough. They can\u2019t be deployed in isolation and need to work in coordination across systems to execute complex multi-step processes \u2013 manifesting as agentic workflows. Unlike monolithic systems with predictable interactions, an agentic workflow orchestrates a network of AI agents to solve intricate and layered problems autonomously with machine-scale analysis and human in the loop decision making.\nBusinesses need advanced orchestration frameworks capable of managing these complex interactions, ensuring robust error handling and maintaining workflow continuity across teams. Developing a clear roadmap will be critical in helping organizations deploy and scale AI agents effectively.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nAccountability and Governance\nWith multiple agentic workflows operating independently yet collaboratively, ensuring accountability is a major challenge. Without a well-defined governance model, businesses risk a lack of oversight, which can lead to noncompliance, financial discrepancies, and reduced trust in AI-driven processes. Agents need to understand the rules of business that humans follow \u2013 rules that are defined by legal frameworks, ethical practices, and captured in contracts between customers, suppliers, and partners.\nBy \u201cgut checking\u201d decisions against contractual terms before taking action and ensuring clear audit trails are in place across the business, agentic decision-making becomes transparent and traceable, and far less likely to result in unnecessary liability.\nEnsuring Data and Privacy\nIn any enterprise system, it\u2019s critical for organizations to handle sensitive information responsibly and securely. Before deploying agentic workflows, ensure that data is clean and structured so sensitive information may be used by multiple agents simultaneously without exposure.\nThis applies to bank account details that are necessary for supplier payments, employee personal information, and contract data, as prime examples. Businesses should also establish secure data pipelines and continuous compliance measures to mitigate risks while enabling AI agents to function effectively and responsibly.\nTrust and Change Management\nAdopting agentic workflows requires more than just technical capability \u2013 it demands cultural change. Many organizations struggle with trusting AI agents due to concerns about reliability, accuracy, bias, ethical implications, and lack of transparency.\nIn fact, a recent study revealed data output quality and security and privacy concerns are among the top 10 barriers to AI adoption. Resistance to change within organizations, combined with a lack of understanding of how AI agents work, can create obstacles.\nFor businesses to fully embrace agentic AI, increase AI literacy and awareness around how AI agents operate with internal training and a top-down call to action driven by leadership. Emphasizing security protocols and privacy protections will also help to build confidence.\nThe First Step Toward an Autonomous Enterprise\nSo where can businesses realize immediate value from AI agents and agentic workflows?\nAI agents are only as good as the data they train on. If enterprises want to drive profitability and capture returns from their AI strategy, they should start by looking at the data that drives the flow of commerce. Commercial agreements and the critical data they contain are foundational to how enterprises buy and sell, while also providing the compliance constraints agents need to do their jobs well without adding layers of risk.\nThe path to agentic AI is not a straight line. Yet by strategically addressing challenges, businesses can unlock new levels of intelligence and operational efficiency to embrace their future as an autonomous enterprise.\nWe list the best performance management software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

If it\u2019s AI, it\u2019s here\n- Best AI chatbots\n- Best AI image generators\n- Best AI website builders\n- Best AI virtual assistants\n- Best AI Notes Apps\n- Best voice generators\n- Best voice changers\n- Best translators\n- Best music generators\n- Best for content creation\n- Best video generators\n- Best for photo editors\n- Best for marketing & sales\n- Best for trading\n- Best AI for research\n- Best AI for teachers\n- Best AI for students\n- FAQs\nIf you work with AI tools every day like I do, you probably know this already that most of them sound better on the landing page than they perform in real life. So instead of repackaging PR blurbs and feature checklists, I decided to actually try them.\nThis guide is the result of hundreds of hours spent signing up, testing features, running real workflows, and figuring out which AI tools actually help get work done, across every major use case I could think of.\nI went deep into each tool, from image generation to email automation, chatbot building to scheduling assistants. TechRadar's team and I have personally tested every tool in this guide. So, let\u2019s get right into it.\nBest AI website builder tools\nWhen it comes to AI website builder tools, Hostinger is a standout. Their AI-powered suite covers various functionalities, making website creation effortless.

Find out more.\nThe best AI tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nPawan is a tech writer at TechRadar Pro, where he covers AI tools advancements, product reviews, how-to guides, and more. He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builder platforms that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is one of the best web hosting and website builder providers. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content.

GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough. Built-in features cover everything from appointment booking and email marketing to social posts and eCommerce setup. It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI Notes Apps\n1. Jaime\n- What is it: An AI note-taker that records and summarizes meetings without using bots.\n- Ideal for: Founders, managers, sales teams, or recruiters who need instant, structured summaries of meetings\nAI note-taking tools handle tasks like reviewing meetings, creating summaries, or managing action items. Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions. Its AI assistant helps with writing follow-ups, searching across meetings, or drafting ideas post-call. The free plan includes 10 meetings/month. Opt for their paid plans, which begin at \u20ac24/user/month with longer meetings, priority support, and more AI usage.\n2. Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams. With support for 100+ languages, smart filters, and deep integrations with CRMs and project tools, it becomes more than just a transcription tool. The free plan includes unlimited transcription and limited AI summaries. You can subscribe to its paid plans starting at $10/user/month with unlimited summaries, AI apps, and integration support.\n3. Notion AI\n- What is it: An all-in-one AI assistant built into Notion for writing, research, task planning, and workspace queries.\n- Ideal for: Notion power users, content teams, students, or managers who want AI help across notes, databases, and documents.\nPart of Notion workspace, Notion\u2019s AI helps you summarize, reformat, translate, brainstorm, and get answers from your notes without switching tools.\nI used Notion to tidy up a messy project doc, pull action items from team sync notes, and turn revision material into a toggle-style quiz guide\nUnlike regular AI notetakers, Notion is context-aware. Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords. It scans the entire page, or even your whole workspace, to understand what matters. Then it delivers a clear, relevant answer.\nYou can even narrow that search to a specific doc, database, or tagged goal using @mentions. It also pulls content from connected tools like Google Drive or Slack and adds citations when needed.\n\u2705 You already use Notion as your main workspace: Notion AI is built into the tools you\u2019re already using, from notes to docs to calendars.\n\u2705 You want an all-in-one AI assistant: It handles writing, editing, summarizing, translating, and even extracting data from other tools.\n\u2705 You need workspace-level search: Ask it to find updates, draft pages, or summarize anything across your workspace.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Notion at all: It only works inside Notion, so it won\u2019t help with external docs or tools unless integrated.\n\u274c You need a perfect structure every time: Some summaries or tables need edits to match your format or tone.\nThere\u2019s also an AI Chat that works like a workspace-wide command center. It runs on GPT\u20114 and Claude to help with prompts or planning. I asked for a 5K training schedule and got a full week-by-week plan with toggles.\nIf you're not sure where to begin, the Notion templates gallery is worth checking out. It comes with a bunch of pre-built layouts for everything from meeting notes and study planners to editorial calendars and startup CRMs. You can add a template, then ask AI to help you populate or personalize it instantly.\nSome features still need polishing. The study tools often require manual edits, and summaries may lose detail unless you specify it to keep the original phrasing.\nBest AI assistant for Notion users who want writing, search, and task help\nNotion brings AI tools like GPT-4 and Claude straight into your Notion docs, making it perfect for summarizing, brainstorming, writing, and workspace querying. It helps you clean up text, generate tasks, build custom dashboards, or auto-fill databases. A free trial is available in all accounts. If you want more, go for Notion\u2019s paid plan at $10/user/month with full feature access and integrations.\nBest AI voice generators\n1. Murf.ai\nMurfai.ai is by far one of the most popular AI voice generators. Their AI-powered voice technology can create realistic voices that sound like real humans, with intonation, pronunciation, and emotions that are similar to those of a human speaker.\nUsers can generate voices in a wide range of languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, and more. They also offer different accents for each language, allowing users to select the one that suits their projects.\nCustomization features include adjusting the voice speed, pitch, and volume to suit your specific needs, and the option to choose between male and female voices, which can add more versatility to your projects.\nLike most of its alternatives, Murf.ai offers a pay-per-use model, which means that you only pay for the number of characters you need to convert to speech. You also get a free trial with 5,000 characters, to get you started with the software and allow you to test the service before committing to a plan. Murf.ai starts at $29/month or $19/ month if billed yearly.\n2. Play.ht\nPlay.ht is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that allows users to convert written text into realistic-sounding audio. The software offers a range of options for users, including male voices, female voices, and multiple languages.\nOne of the main advantages of Play.ht is its ease of use.

They offer pay-as-you-go options as well as monthly subscriptions. Additionally, Play.ht offers a free plan with a 5,000-word limit. Premium plans start at $39.25/ month or $29.25/ month billed yearly\nHowever, note that the service may not be suitable for users who require highly specialized voices. If you need strong regional accents or unique speech patterns this might not be your suitable option.\nWhile the voices are generally of high quality, they may sound robotic and unnatural sometimes, especially when speaking longer pieces of text.\nPlay.ht is useful, efficient, and cost-effective for users who need to convert text to audio fast and easily, but it may not be the best choice for all users. It all comes down to your specific needs and requirements.\n3. Lovo.ai\nLovo.ai is a text-to-speech (TTS) software that provides AI-generated voices in multiple languages and accents.

ElevenLabs\nEleven Labs offers solid features to transform text into natural-sounding speech and to clone voices with great accuracy. It offers a level of realism that sets it apart from other similar tools. While getting started, you can train the AI with just a few voice samples to create personalized voices for a variety of purposes. Plus, you can even earn every time someone uses your voice on their project.\nIt excels with its Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature and offers four distinct AI speech models: Eleven Turbo v2 for low latency, Eleven English v1 with plenty of voices and styles, Eleven Multilingual v1 which supports 10 languages, and Eleven Multilingual v2 supporting 29 languages. Plus, you can choose from over 40 pre-made voices or create your own custom voices. It further helps in fine-tuning of stability, clarity, and style exaggeration simply by generation speed and output quality for optimal results.\nEleven Labs offers two levels of voice cloning. Instant Voice Cloning needs just a few minutes of audio to create a high-quality clone quickly. Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly. Alongside, their pricing structure is based on usage which makes it pretty expensive for heavy usage.\nFor instance, ElevenLabs AI has 4 premium plans i.e. Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. Under this, the cheapest plan starts at $5/mo and includes basic features and a 30,000-character output capacity whereas, the most expensive plan costs $330//mo and offers 2,000,000 character output and 660 custom voice slots . This could prove expensive for you if you want extensive voice synthesis and have a tight budget.\n2. Speechify\nSpeechify also coverts text to speech, with an extensive library of over 200 unique voices that include various genders, accents, and speaking styles. With Speechify, you can fine-tune specific elements on a word-by-word basis and make precise adjustments to pitch, speed, and tone.\nIt offers a video dubbing tool that automatically translates and dubs audio for videos from YouTube or uploaded files.

These avatars can be customized for tone and emotion, which improves their lifelike appearance. Similarly, Speechify\u2019s neat user interface and drag-and-drop functionality make editing straightforward and creating content very smooth.\nMoreover, Speechify also comes with cross-platform compatibility through which it works seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, computers, and makes it accessible for you across different devices. It also integrates well with many platforms like Notion, WordPress, and HubSpot.\n3.

Still, if you're more focused on having advanced voice customization or a wider variety of AI voices, then you might want to consider using a dedicated AI voice changer instead.\nBest AI translators\n1. Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2. Microsoft translator\nGiving cut-throat competition to Google, Microsoft also has a translation service of its own. The Microsoft Translator provides text, voice, and document translation across multiple languages. In our opinion, you\u2019ll make the most out of this translator if you prefer working on Microsoft\u2019s workspace. We say this because its integration with Microsoft products and its focus on business and enterprise use cases boost your productivity and save you a good amount of time.\nMicrosoft Translator extends to over 100 languages and offers many translation options. It further provides customizable translations through its Translator API and Speech service, both part of the Azure AI Services suite. This helps businesses to integrate translation capabilities into their applications, call centers, and multilingual conversational agents, all of which help in smooth and efficient communication with global customers.\nDuring our test, we used a feature called \"Live Transcribe\" that can transcribe speech in real time. This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4. DeepL\nDeepL is an AI-powered translation service famous for its accurate translations and careful focus on language nuances. It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

      "text": "Agentic AI: unlocking new potential, demanding new rules\nAgentic AI: Tools transforming life, raising trust and privacy concerns\nA critical development in artificial intelligence is agentic AI, and these tools are becoming a part of everyday life faster than we realize. Unlike traditional AI models that follow predefined rules, agentic AI systems can make decisions, perform actions, and adapt to situations based on their programming and the data they process, often without human input.\nIn comparison, traditional AI models are unable to adapt to unexpected changes without a form of retraining, testing and validation, which requires human intervention. A traditional AI model will typically be built to fulfil a specific role, such as a classification task where it will identify if a person is likely to default on a loan payment or not.\nFrom self-instructed house robots to focused data analysis, agentic AI promises convenience and efficiency. However, with that shift comes much deeper access to our personal data, which raises new concerns over transparency, trust, and control.\nLeading IEEE expert and professor of computational intelligence at Manchester Metropolitan University.\nAgentic AI: The shift from support to self-direction\nAgentic AI behavior is goal-driven \u2013 it must determine how to achieve its primary goal and sub-goals, requiring it to prioritize tasks and solve problems independently of humans. For example, a house robot might be instructed to \u201ckeep the house clean\u201d. The system will then act independently to assess different areas of the home and undertake tasks where appropriate, without requiring constant human intervention. As part of this process, the robot will identify individual sub goals, such as tidying the living room or vacuuming dirty floors, while making its own decisions to achieve the objectives.\nAlternatively, businesses might employ agentic AI to analyze datasets over a specified period and identify trends and preferences, which can then be applied to other company strategies. For instance, creating targeted email campaigns. Automating the process brings instant access to valuable insights, increasing human capacity for time spent on more strategy-focused tasks.\nThese examples illustrate the power agentic systems have to identify opportunities, execute strategies, and adapt to different goals. But as the use of agentic AI increases, businesses and developers should carefully evaluate our trust in them and how they influence our human-machine relationships.\nThe evolving human-machine link\nAgentic AI is fundamentally transforming the human role in tasks through automation, creating a more balanced human-to-machine relationship. As agentic systems utilize deep learning and complex image and object recognition, they can operate in increasingly dynamic environments and solve complex problems autonomously, without any human involvement.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nReduced human intervention not only offers greater efficiency in work, both at home and in businesses, but also frees up time to focus on more strategic initiatives. However, as trust builds towards these automation tools, reduced human oversight comes with a potential risk of over-reliance. While we benefit from agentic AI\u2019s efficiency, we must also ensure we have the opportunity to upskill and educate ourselves.\nWhilst agentic systems can operate independently, they still require value and goal alignment to maintain control over the outputs and ensure it aligns with the desired outcome, not just what was instructed of them. Otherwise, there is concern that these systems may take dangerous shortcuts or bypass other infrastructure to achieve efficiency.\nThe future of AI ethics and privacy demands\nIn turn, this raises numerous ethical concerns surrounding agentic AI. One key debate is data privacy and the security of sensitive data \u2013 this can vary in severity depending on the industry in which the organization operates.\nFor example, agentic AI has already been deployed by cybersecurity companies to detect and correlate threats by analyzing network activity in real-time and then autonomously responding to potential breaches.\nHowever, organizations who implement this must provide data to the system, raising questions over the security and privacy of their information. Without human oversight, organizations must consider if they are comfortable with agentic AI making business-altering judgement and being on the frontier of their most valuable assets.\nBias in agentic AI can occur because of human input and data. When such a system is entrusted with making moral decisions that have real-world consequences, it faces significant ethical considerations. While existing or emerging legislation provides guidance, there is still much to be done to unpack and implement these concepts within operationalized AI systems fully.\nFurthermore, systems with access to highly sensitive data have raised security concerns as they can have vulnerabilities exploited. This has been highlighted by recent cyber attacks, and information within digital environments is at risk. In such complex systems, who is held accountable if things go wrong?\nKey considerations for ethical AI use\nWhile we are guided by ethical principles and emerging legislation, it is essential that we have safeguards in place for both agentic and traditional AI systems. When automating manual tasks and analyzing datasets, it is crucial to identify and mitigate bias in both data and algorithms with consistent human oversight. Organizations that utilize agentic AI should strive for ethical practice which can be supported through training and continuous auditing. This helps ensure fairness and prevents harm while creating transparency around how automated decisions are made.\nWe've featured the best private browser.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.
