      "summary": "The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, held steady at 2.6% in July, giving traders a boost to their September rate‑cut bets. Core PCE rose 0.3% month‑over‑month to 2.9%, just above forecasts, while the overall market sentiment reflected an 85% probability of a Fed cut in September. Fed Chair Powell highlighted the labor market as a larger concern than inflation, reinforcing the cut narrative. In response, equity futures slipped modestly after a day of record highs, underscoring the market’s sensitivity to the inflation data.",
