      "summary": "Markets are braced for a turbulent September as investors weigh Fed rate‑cut expectations, upcoming jobs and inflation data, and political risks. Corporate news has spurred gains in tech, pharma, and defense stocks, while silver surged above $40 an ounce and gold edged toward an all‑time high. European equities are supported by defense deployment plans and a positive health‑care study, but remain sensitive to France’s confidence vote. Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures are flat, and the Fed’s potential September cut is priced in, with markets watching payrolls and Fed commentary for confirmation.",
