  "description": "You don\u2019t need a tech giant\u2019s budget to benefit from their mindset.",
  "content": "Startups often think they need to operate differently from large tech companies, especially when it comes to their digital presence. I\u2019ve heard it many times: \u201cWe\u2019ll invest in content later,\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s just get a basic site up for now and focus on growth.\u201d And while that might seem practical in the short term, it\u2019s a strategic misstep in today\u2019s environment.\n\nThe truth is, your digital presence is your business infrastructure. It\u2019s how investors discover you, how partners evaluate you and how customers start to build trust. If you wait until you \u201chave time\u201d to get serious about your domain, content or brand architecture, you\u2019ve already missed the window to shape your story. And you might not even realize the opportunities you\u2019re losing.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a tech giant\u2019s budget to benefit from their mindset. You just need to borrow their intentionality.\n\nThere\u2019s a common misconception that startups should wait to build out content until after launch and that it\u2019s a \u201cnice to have\u201d once funding or product-market fit is in place. But content today isn\u2019t just about marketing; it\u2019s about discoverability, credibility and operational readiness.\n\n\u201cAlmost use social media as part of their regular work flow,\u201d and more than 30% say it directly influences their investment decisions. The way your company shows up in search (and in AI-generated summaries and overviews) shapes how people perceive your brand.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing what the industry is calling \u201c ,\u201d where impressions are rising, but clicks are falling. That\u2019s because tools like Google\u2019s AI Overviews and ChatGPT are scraping answers directly from trusted sources. If your brand doesn\u2019t publish from an authoritative domain and if you don\u2019t own your message, you won\u2019t even be in the game.\n\nOne tactic we\u2019ve implemented with our clients is including an FAQ section on blog posts. Frame each FAQ as a real search query. For example, \u201cHow do I secure my startup domain?\u201d And provide a concise, trustworthy answer. These are the snippets that AI pulls into responses, and they can drive visibility even when clicks are down.\n\nLarge companies don\u2019t just buy one domain. They use a tactic called , wherein they secure everything around it, including typos, country-level variations and alternate top-level domains (TLDs). Why? Because they know the cost of brand confusion, phishing attempts and hijacked traffic.\n\nStartups are often surprised to learn that this applies to them, too. We\u2019ve seen small teams barely out of stealth get impersonated in phishing schemes because a hacker noticed a spike in media attention. All it takes is one press mention or funding announcement to put a target on your back.\n\nThat\u2019s why even early-stage founders should think defensively:\n\u2022 Register your main TLDs (.com, .io, .ai, .co).\n\u2022 Use domain-based email from day one (not @gmail).\n\u2022 Redirect all alternate domains to your primary site.\n\nA small upfront investment here can prevent headaches down the road in both brand trust and operational security.\n\nStructure Your Domain Like You Plan To Scale\n\nWhen people look at your company online, they\u2019re not just evaluating what\u2019s there today; they\u2019re imagining how well you\u2019ll grow. Your domain architecture tells that story.\n\nTech companies like Google, Apple and Atlassian do this exceptionally well. Google uses dot-brand domains to separate key functions (blog.google, about.google, ai.google). Apple centralizes its user journeys under clearly labeled folders like \u201d/support\u201d and \u201c/legal.\u201d Atlassian balances branded products like trello.com with consistent styling across subdomains.\n\nWhat\u2019s the lesson for startups? Build your namespace with intention:\n\u2022 Make sure your internal linking, meta titles and CTAs feel cohesive.\n\nLooking even further ahead, ICANN is launching its next round of TLD applications in 2026. That means brands, even startups, can apply to own their own dot-brand, like .brandname. I co-authored a book on this with Joe Alagna, our CSO at it.com Domains (How to Get Your Own Top-Level Domain), because I believe owning your namespace is going to become a competitive advantage. Start thinking about it now, before everyone else does.\n\nHere\u2019s a little secret: No one knows how big your team is online. If you get your digital presence right, you can look enterprise-ready from day one, even if you\u2019re still five people in a WeWork.\n\nThat\u2019s because consistency signals credibility. Figma uses @figma across every touchpoint. Stripe maintains uniform styling across docs, pricing pages and support. Duolingo sounds the same whether they\u2019re onboarding a user or posting on TikTok.\n\nStartups can do the same:\n\u2022 Use a domain-based email signature that reinforces your brand.\n\u2022 Keep your page titles, meta descriptions and favicon consistent across the site.\n\nThe important thing is how trustworthy and prepared you look when someone Googles you. And they will Google you.\n\nYou\u2019ll never know which investor passed because your online presence looked half-baked. You won\u2019t be able to track which potential partner didn\u2019t follow up because your site lacked clarity or professionalism. But the lost opportunities are real.\n\nAnd the biggest barriers for most founders? Time. Resources. Focus. Founders are juggling fundraising, product, team-building and a dozen other priorities. It\u2019s understandable.\n\nBut your digital presence is one of the few levers you can fully control. You can\u2019t force market timing. You can\u2019t make someone invest. But you can show up like a company worth betting on.\n\nAdopt The Tech Giant Mindset Without The Budget\n\nTech giants treat their digital presence like an extension of their business model. As a startup, you can do the same\u2014and you can do it without spending millions.\n\nThink ahead. Own your namespace. Build credibility before you need it. And remember: Content, structure, protection and consistency are the foundation.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fake it \u2018til you make it. You just have to build it like you mean it.\n\nis the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.",

      "text": "Social media is joining traditional financial news media as a key source of information used by institutional investors in their investment processes. A new study from Greenwich Associates reveals that almost 80% of institutional investors use social media as part of their regular work flow, and approximately 30% of these investors say information obtained through social media has directly influenced an investment recommendation or decision.\nIn a report released today entitled, Institutional Investing in the Digital Age: How Social Media Informs and Shapes the Investing Process, Greenwich Associates presents the results of its study of 256 corporate and public pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, and foundations in the U.S., Europe and Asia.\nAbout half these institutions say information obtained on social media has prompted them to take some specific action. For example:\n- 48% of the investors said information from social media prompted them to do additional research on an industry issue or topic\n- 37% said they shared information from social media with decision-makers at their companies\n- 34% said information learned on social media influenced a decision to work with a particular client or company\n- 33% said information obtained on social media triggered a discussion with their investment consultant\n\u201cThese results show that social media is influencing decisions that can result in the allocations of billions of investment dollars around the world,\u201d says Dan Connell, Head of Market Structure and Technology at Greenwich Associates and author of the study. \u201cWith approximately 40% of the institutions globally expecting to increase their use of social media in the coming year, we\u2019re projecting a further, rapid increase of social media influence in institutional investment markets.\u201d\nLinkedIn Top Platform for Professional Use\nGiven the commitment of the professional user, LinkedIn is the preferred source for professional use with 52% penetration in the institutional investor segment, and 85% of those investors that use the platform are doing so at least weekly. Among the other key findings presented in the report are the following:\n- Institutional Investors in Asia are consistently higher users of all forms of social sources than their counterparts in North America and Europe.\n- Facebook and YouTube are the most popular platforms when it comes to personal use and have also gained traction in the professional space for group discussion and video distribution.\n- LinkedIn is still the most widely used platform of investors for work-related purposes. More than 50% of study participants said they use LinkedIn for professional or financial purposes.\n- Institutions cited the value of the Twitter news feed in seeking opinions or commentary on market events, but said LinkedIn feeds were better targeted as they more closely reflected their professional ties.\nImplications for the Industry\nThe results of the Greenwich Associates study demonstrate that asset managers and other investment firms looking to attract investment dollars from pensions, insurance companies, endowments, and foundations must consider the nature of their social media presence.\n\u201cHaving an updated company site with relevant product details should be considered table stakes,\u201d says Dan Connell. \u201cStand-out firms will go much further by acting as regular contributors of content and insight, creating a relationship with their potential clients and drawing them back to their site again and again.\u201d"

      "text": "The roll-out of AI Overviews now creates two opportunities for top-ranking content to log impressions for a given keyword, while simultaneously reducing the number of people who click from the search engine results page (SERP) into your content.\nIf your boss is giving you a hard time over this, it really isn\u2019t your fault. As this SERoundtable article attests to, this is something being observed across the industry (comments on my recent LinkedIn post corroborate this, too).\nAnd we\u2019re impacted. Here\u2019s what this looks like for the Ahrefs blog, via the GSC report in Ahrefs:\nIn the six-month period at the end of 2024, the daily impressions and clicks for the Ahrefs blog showed a positive correlation of 0.425. Clicks and impressions generally increased together. You can see this in the graph above: both lines generally move up and down in tandem.\nIn the first six months of this year, that correlation has changed radically to a negative correlation of -0.352. Now, as impressions climb, clicks tend to decrease at the same time. Impressions are soaring while clicks are plummeting. Clicks and impressions have become decoupled from one another\u2014one can grow while the other declines.\nHence what Darwin Santos perfectly dubbed \u201cThe Great Decoupling\u201d. One of the few hard-and-fast rules of SEO no longer holds. Thanks Google.\nImpressions are increasing because AI Overviews now give companies two chances to log an impression for a given keyword: once as a \u201ctraditional\u201d blue link in the search results, and again as a citation in an AI Overview.\nMost AI Overview citations seem to be pulled from content that already ranks highly in the traditional search results (per one study, \u201cThree-quarters of the links cited in Google AI Overview appear in position 12 or higher in the organic search results\u201d).\nIf your content already ranks highly enough to earn a decent number of organic impressions, there\u2019s a good chance it could also be cited in an AI Overview and earn impressions there, too.\nAt the same time, clicks are decreasing because AI Overviews are increasing zero-click searches. Searchers can get all the information they need to resolve their query without leaving the search results page.\nWhen we studied this at scale across 300,000 keywords, we found that the presence of an AI Overview correlates with a 34.5% reduction in clickthrough rate.\nSo, at the same time that impressions are soaring, clicks are at an all-time low.\nThe period of this widening gap between clicks and impressions corresponds with the large-scale rollout of AI Overviews. Alongside the March Core update, we found that the presence of AI Overviews doubled, increasing by 116%\u2014the same time these \u201ccrocodile mouths\u201d appeared:\nAnd, as Ahrefs\u2019 Patrick Stox points out, sites with very few AI Overviews do not share this same pattern:\nThe great decoupling will probably continue until AI Overviews finish rolling out\u2014but now that it seems likely that AI Mode will become the default search experience, it\u2019s possible this trend could continue.\nYou can use the SERP features filter to see exactly where AI Overviews are triggering for your keyword rankings.\nHead to Ahrefs\u2019 Site Explorer, navigate to the Organic keywords report, and select AI Overview from the SERP features filter. Filter to keywords where your domain ranks in Position: 1-10, and you\u2019ll see the keywords most likely to receive impressions from both organic rankings and an AI Overview:\nWhen I do this for Ahrefs, I can see over 19,000 keywords that trigger an AI Overview and include Ahrefs in the top ten results:\nUsing Ahrefs\u2019 new AI visibility tool, Brand Radar, you can then filter our database of AI Overviews to see those that include a link to your URL:\nHere, I can see over 5,000 keywords that include Ahrefs as a citation. Any keywords that appear both here and in the previous report are likely to be suffering from increased impressions and reduced clicks, pulling double-duty in both the organic results and the AI Overview.\nFinal thoughts\nI\u2019ve seen hundreds of GSC accounts over the years, and until recently, never seen a pattern like this. Now it\u2019s everywhere.\nIn the past, blog traffic growth seemed well correlated with business growth. But today, I see that correlation weakening. This isn\u2019t a case of one blog bleeding traffic\u2014this is an entire industry being recalibrated in real-time.\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. While our clicks are tanking because of AI search, recent data from Patrick Stox shows that\u2014at least on the Ahrefs website\u2014visits from AI search convert 23x better than visits from traditional search.\nThe way content marketing functions is very different, but guess what? There are more potential customers in the world, more demand for products and services. That is the real determinant of growth, not clicks to a blog. We\u2019ll find different ways to reach those people.\n(But we should probably change our traffic growth targets\u2026)"

      "text": "How To Protect Your Brand Online \u2013 And What Domains Have to Do With It\n- by Ilona K.\nTable of contents\nBrand protection is something that businesses of any size can\u2019t ignore. Not only do a majority of brands face infringement issues and have to spend money on litigation, but those infringements also lead to customer confusion, loss of revenue and damage to a brand\u2019s reputation.\nBrand protection, defined as the detection of, and enforcement against, infringing brand assets and content, is a major part of a company\u2019s IP (intellectual property) management and business administration. It sits closely to domain name management in the efforts to protect brand identity online.\nDavid Barnett, the author of the \u2018Brand Protection in the Online World\u2019 book and Brand Protection Strategist at Stobbs IP, shares five tips and tactics to use domain name management for brand protection.\nDeep Data Analysis\nDomain variations are being increasingly utilised by bad actors to drive visitors to non-legitimate content. Those range from \u2018fuzzy\u2019 matches to the brand name to exact matches to the official site name but on a different TLD.\nSuccess in tackling brand infringement issues online is down to the use of a range of data analysis approaches which are able to detect as many vulnerable content areas as possible. In practice, this tends to a combination of:\n- Mean analysis of zone files (data files containing lists of all registered domains) with other approaches (such as parallel look-ups and exact-string searches), and\n- Analysis of results from search engines (\u2018metasearching\u2019) and other data sources, such as zone configuration information (e.g. \u2018passive DNS analysis\u2019), \u2018certificate transparency\u2019 (CT) analysis, or the use of explicit query-terms across particular domains.\nProgrammes such as the TMCH (Trademark Clearing House) and others can also help organisations receive early warning of potential infringements. Looking at the keyword strings and TLDs most utilised by bad actors can also help to inform another tactic \u2013 a defensive registration strategy.\nDefensive Registration\nAn effective proactive measure that brands can take to safeguard their domain assets is a defensive registration policy. It includes:\n- Registering key brand variants under official ownership (e.g. facebook.com and fb.com) and implementing redirection rules;\n- Registering the domain in multiple ccTLDs (country code top level domains) and nTLDs (new TLDs);\n- Registering domains intended for future use, for example, for planned brand- or product launches.\nDefensive registration supports managing a portfolio of domains used to host client-facing corporate and product websites as well as email infrastructure, and preventing potential infringers impersonating the brand.\nDot-Brand Extensions\nAs brand owners, you may also wish to consider applying to run their own dot-brand extension. A dot-brand domain is a type of gTLD (generic top-level domain) that enables you to put your brand name to the right of the dot in a domain name, like sport.bbc or dealership.bentley.\nUsing your brand name as a TLD in its own right gives a capability to control all official websites and distribution channels. Multiple service providers offer support in preparing applications for a dot-brand TLD registration.\nAI and Automation\nAI (artificial intelligence) is powerful when it comes to finding a right domain name, checking availability and analysing data for more efficient domain name portfolio management.\nGoing forward, we expect AI to widely support domain name management in the context of brand protection. For example, some AI tools already incorporate checks to ensure that the suggestions will not infringe protected IP.\nThere are also opportunities for AI to be integrated into the next generation of brand monitoring and domain management tools. We envisage monitoring systems which learn how to evolve their own settings to more accurately filter and prioritise content, and identify trends in infringement patterns, as well as AI tools to both identify and tackle multiple infringement variations on an automated basis.\nResearching Solutions and Providers\nFinally, it is also advantageous to explore the competitive landscape for a brand protection service provider. Top tier enterprise providers will make use of a range of methodologies \u2013 even when no live site content is yet present.\nThey will take into account factors such as registrant (domain owner), ISP (Internet service provider, or hosting provider) and registrar characteristics, TLD risk level, presence of MX (mail exchange) records (i.e. whether domains can send and receive emails), web traffic, domain-name entropy (a measure of the amount of randomness in the domain-name string), and so on, to quantify the overall level of threat.\nWant more expert tips to grow your brand online?
