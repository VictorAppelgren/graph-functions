But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "Six years ago, while researching for a college entrepreneurship competition, Valentina Agudelo identified a troubling gap in breast cancer survival rates between Latin America and the developed world, with women in her native Colombia and the rest of the continent dying at higher rates due to late detection.\nShe realized that breast cancer is highly treatable when diagnosed early, yet many Latin American countries have large rural populations lacking access to mammograms and other diagnostic tools.\nSo Agudelo (pictured above) and her two best friends decided to create a theoretical portable device that would detect breast cancer early.\n\u201cThe idea stuck with me,\u201d Agudelo told TechCrunch. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t let go of the problem we had identified.\u201d\nShortly after the competition ended, Agudelo founded Salva Health and began developing the company\u2019s first product, Julietta, a small device that measures tissue density with electrodes that attach to each breast and provides results within minutes to a phone, tablet, or computer.\nSince then, Agudelo graduated from college, interned at PepsiCo, worked for Colombian health tech startup Dondoctor, and completed an MBA at INSEAD. It was a lot to juggle, but Salva always remained her main focus.\nSalva Health partnered with Grupo Sura, a major Colombian insurance company, to conduct clinical trials and develop an AI model capable of predicting breast cancer risk.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThe company currently employs 13 people and is close to receiving approval from Colombia\u2019s INVIMA (National Institute for Drug and Food Surveillance), a regulatory agency equivalent to the FDA.\nJulieta is not a substitute for mammograms. It\u2019s a screening tool designed to detect abnormalities and assess the likelihood of malignancy. \u201cWith that information, insurance companies can prioritize women for proper diagnosis,\u201d Agudelo said.\nSalva, a TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 Startup Battlefield finalist, plans to start distributing Julieta throughout Latin America after it receives the green light from INVIMA. Agudelo explained that other countries in the region are expected to recognize INVIMA\u2019s approvals based on commercial treaties.\nThe company also intends to request that the FDA acknowledges INVIMA\u2019s approval. Although the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a significant shortage of mammogram machines or a large rural population, screening some women with Julieta instead could result in substantial cost savings for health insurances, Agudelo said.\n\u201cAnd then, we want to start getting approval and recognized in other countries, focused on emerging markets: Africa, India,\u201d she said.\nInstead of selling Julieta to clinics, Salva plans to provide the device for free and charge health payors for each screening.\nAgudelo said that she chose the hardware-as-a-service business model because she wanted to retain control of the device and data, so the company can make improvements to it when necessary.\nBut Salva doesn\u2019t want to limit itself to breast screening only. \u201cWe\u2019re currently exploring solutions for early signs of diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Agudelo said. \u201cWe are focusing on detecting these conditions early so they can get proper diagnosis and treatment at a fraction of the cost.\u201d"

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "It looks fake, or at least like a good illusion: There\u2019s geCKo Materials founder Dr. Capella Kerst dangling a full wine bottle from her pinky finger, the only thing keeping it from smashing to pieces being the super-strong dry-adhesive her startup has brought to market.\nBut it\u2019s no trick. It\u2019s the result of years of academic research that Kerst, who holds a PhD in mechanical engineering from Stanford University, built on by inventing a method to mass-manufacture the adhesive. Inspired by the way real-life gecko feet grip surfaces, you could think of it like a new Velcro \u2014 except it only needs one side, leaves no residue, and can detach as quickly as it attaches. It can do this at least 120,000 times and, as Kerst noted in a recent interview with TechCrunch, can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or even years.\nKerst has spent the last few years giving this magic trick-style demo any and everywhere: At VC happy hours, during pitch meetings, and on TikTok and Instagram Reels. And it works. Not just mechanically, but as a method of quickly captivating investors and customers. The company raised a $2 million seed round in 2021 in less than 36 hours, and boasts Ford, Pacific Gas & Electric, and even NASA as early customers.\nYes, before Kerst makes her pitch on the Startup Battlefield stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, geCKo Materials\u2019 adhesive has already been to space.\nThe adhesive is incredibly strong. One square-inch tile of it can hold 15 pounds, vertically, while six of them is enough to pull a car. It works by leveraging van der Waals forces, which involves interactions at the intermolecular level.\nIt can be complicated to understand, so Kerst likes to lean on what geCKo\u2019s material is not.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not excretion, it\u2019s not tape, it\u2019s not glue, it\u2019s not micro-hooks,\u201d Kerst explained. It doesn\u2019t require an electrical charge of any kind. It\u2019s also not based on suction, which is what some other companies that promise gecko-like adhesive tend to use, Kerst wryly noted. Suction-based methods create concentrations of force, she said, meaning force is applied unevenly, potentially causing fractures or leaving debris behind.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nReally, she said, geCKo\u2019s material is more like micro hairs that are 1/100th of the size of a hair on a person\u2019s head. When applied to a smooth or semi-smooth surface, they pull down and \u201cshear\u201d to create \u201can extremely strong force.\u201d Pull in the opposite direction at anything more than 20 degrees relative to the plane of that shear and it detaches in milliseconds.\nThis makes it possible to uniformly load the force and, just as importantly, uniformly disengage the force, which means it can be used for very delicate objects like quartz wafers, glass, solar panels, or even food items like eggs and rotten tomatoes.\nSo far that has meant it is a great material for robots or drones that do lots of picking and placing, which is one reason geCKo Materials has found early success with manufacturers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re eliminating the traditional pitfalls of adhesives,\u201d Kerst said.\nThe wine bottle demo is emblematic of how Kerst wants to approach mass-manufacturing geCKo Materials adhesive. It\u2019s simple, but impactful. The demo \u201cgets people\u2019s ideas flowing,\u201d Kerst told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re a public benefit corp., so we are for-profit, but I want to help people save energy, time, and money, and just bring back innovation in the hardware space.\u201d\nIt\u2019s such a tempting product to fiddle with that, in a recent interview with YouTube show The Pitch, she had a prospective investor ready to pony up $1,200 on the spot to take a piece home. (In part, funnily enough, so the investor could show it to some magician friends.)\nGetting that cost down is a goal as geCKo Materials scales production, Kerst admits. The current cost is roughly 10 times more than other common adhesive options like 3M\u2019s command strips. But geCKo Materials already has software-like gross profit margins of more than 80% on the material, and Kerst is quick to point out that 3M command strips can only really be used once.\nThe startup already generated more than $700,000 in revenue in 2023, and Kerst said the company has a \u201cclear path\u201d with its current paying customers to do $75 million in annual recurring revenue in five years. It\u2019s also in the process of raising another round of funding to scale operations.\n\u201cI\u2019m really passionate about being able to make local manufacturing more sustainable and bring that around the world,\u201d Kerst said. She also does not shy from the Velcro comparisons. \u201cI do see a pathway in which geCKo Materials is like a household name, a worldwide name. Obviously, we\u2019re already a space-wide name,\u201d she smiled."

These 20 companies were selected as the best of the Startup Battlefield 200 and competed for a chance to take home the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. After three days of intense pitching, we have a winner.\nThe startups taking part in the Startup Battlefield had all been hand-picked to participate in our startup competition. All the companies presented a live demo in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win $100,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.\nAfter hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges\u2019 notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: GeCKo Materials, Luna, MabLab, Salva Health, and Stitch3D.\nThese startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included Navin Chaddha (Mayfield), Chris Farmer (SignalFire), Dayna Grayson (Construct Capital), Ann Miura-Ko (Floodgate), and Hans Tung (Notable Capital).\nWe\u2019re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2024 is . . .\nWinner: Salva Health\nSix years ago, while researching for a college entrepreneurship competition, Valentina Agudelo identified a troubling gap in breast cancer survival rates between Latin America and the developed world, with women in her native Colombia and the rest of the continent dying at higher rates due to late detection. She realized that breast cancer is highly treatable when diagnosed early, yet many Latin American countries have large rural populations lacking access to mammograms and other diagnostic tools. So Agudelo and her two best friends decided to create Salva Health, a theoretical portable device that would detect breast cancer early.\nRead more about Salva Health in our separate post.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nRunner-up: GeCKo Materials\nIt looks fake, or at least like a good illusion: There\u2019s GeCKo Materials founder Capella Kerst dangling a full wine bottle from her pinky finger, the only thing keeping it from smashing to pieces being the super-strong dry-adhesive her startup has brought to market. But it\u2019s no trick. It\u2019s the result of years of academic research that Dr. Kerst built on by inventing a method to mass-manufacture the adhesive. Inspired by the way real-life geckos\u2019 feet grip surfaces, the adhesive is like a new Velcro \u2014 except it only needs one side, leaves no residue, and can detach as quickly as it attaches. It can do this at least 120,000 times and, as Dr. Kerst noted in a recent interview with TechCrunch, can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or even years.\nRead more about GeCKo Materials in our separate post.\nThese two companies follow in the footsteps of Startup Battlefield legends like Dropbox, Discord, Cloudflare, and Mint on the Disrupt stage. With more than 1,500 alumni having participated in the program, Startup Battlefield Alumni have collectively raised over $29 billion in funding with more than 200 successful exits."
