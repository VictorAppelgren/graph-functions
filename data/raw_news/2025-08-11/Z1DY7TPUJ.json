  "title": "Ford\u2019s New Truck Needs To Understand The EV Myths Permating Automaking",
  "description": "Ford promised a Model-T moment.   Will they hit the right mix to sell the public?",
  "content": "Ford promised their announcement of a new \u201cuniversal\u201d EV platform, along with a low-cost light pickup truck, would be another \u201cModel T\u201d moment in automaking history. Ford didn\u2019t show us the truck, just teased various attributes, in particular that their electric truck should sell for about $30,000 and be available in 2027, thanks to new design and manufacuring innovations.\n\nNobody\u2019s going to be critical of making a decent vehicle for a lower price, and Ford certainly knows the truck market, though they haven\u2019t shown the same aplomb in the EV world. Based on what little we know, this is going to be a fairly short range truck, of low utility for towing traditional trailers. Are the choices the right ones?\n\nThe base truck has a battery estimated at around 51kWh. The most efficient pickup today, Rivian\u2019s, would get around 125 miles of range on that, with a practical range under 100 miles. That\u2019s a customer scaring number, and impactical for road trips out of town, though many working trucks that never leave town could indeed get by on that. Perhaps Ford has found a way to make dramatic aerodynamic improvements--they did not show the shape of the truck--but even so, they will not likely get past 150 miles.\n\nOn the plus side, that\u2019s with an LFP battery pack. LFP batteries are cheaper, used in shorter-range Teslas and many Chinese cars. While most of the battery industry has been on a very expensive quest for denser, longer range battery chemistries, \u201cgood old\u201d LFP has been winning the day. While it\u2019s a bit bulkier and heavier, it\u2019s cheaper and you can charge it to 100% every day, which makes up a lot for the reduced range. Ford will make a longer range NMC version as well, according to reports.\n\nFord is perhaps betting that people will realize a not well understood truth, that long range is mostly useful for intercity road trips. (And in some cases, for those doing Level 1 charging at home.) While it\u2019s a bit less convenient, customers who know they plan to use their truck around town can save a bunch of money buying a smaller battery. Ford presumably hopes the $30K price point will attract a whole new class of buyers.\n\nBuyers who don\u2019t understand EVs do indeed think they cost too much. The reality is that EVs are already a fair bit cheaper than ICE equivalents in total cost of ownership, when you add in energy and maintenance. Customers just have trouble feeling that--paying $5,000 more up front and saving $1,000/year is a huge win, but a delayed one. Of course, a vehicle that costs the same and still saves, $1,000/year is great, but that involves some compromises, like range.\n\nIt would be nice if there were a way to get around the psychology of this. A way to sell the car for less but get the owner to pay $500/month more for their electricity (but still less than they paid for gas) so they see themselves saving money every year, not just in the future. It could be that creative accounting is more valuable than good engineering, though both are great.\n\nNo sign as yet from Ford of another interesting solution for pickup trucks, namely a way to mount a temporary rental battery pack, or rental compact generator in the truckbed. That\u2019s much easier to design into a truck than a car. If drivers could stop for 15 minutes at a depot on the way out of town to rent such a range extender, they could get the best of both worlds--a cheap in-town car, and the ability to get extra range on rarer trips out of town.\n\nIt\u2019s not new to Ford, but they also plan to switch to a universal platform, on which they can build trucks, sedans, vans and SUVs. The battery pack of this pickup truck is a structural element that makes the bed of the truck. Universal platforms allow better economies of scale over all models, one of the best ways to drive down prices.\n\nFord spoke a lot about new hardware designs and manufacturing approaches, which is great, but it\u2019s 2025, and the vehicles that win will derive more and more of their value from their software, not their hardware. You need both, but without a world-beating software strategy, failure is likely. We didn\u2019t hear a lot about this, so Ford had better start laying that out soon. It\u2019s not just about making software-defined-vehicles; everybody knows about that, though they had to be dragged, kicking and screaming to do what silicon valley companies do as 2nd nature. It\u2019s hard to imagine a new \"Model-T moment\" without a lot of innovation there.\n\nFord used to have a strong position overseas. It needs to regain that. In the USA, they will have protectionist tariffs to make them complacent, but out in the rest of the world they will be going head to head with China, where the things Ford announced today might generate a yawn, and not many Yuan. Let\u2019s hope that real reinvention of the company is coming.",

      "text": "Ford is Reinventing Vehicle Assembly and Why America Should Care\nNearly 120 years ago, the Ford Model T became the \u201cUniversal Car.\u201d Why? It was affordable, adaptable, and serviceable. America would never be the same.\nNow, we\u2019re ushering in the next chapter with the Ford Universal EV Platform \u2014 a new idea for a new era.\nAs with the Model T, Ford is again betting big on America. In Louisville, Kentucky, the reinvention of our company begins in earnest, with the implementation of an innovative manufacturing process to bring this platform to life.\nWe designed this platform to be the foundation for a new generation of electric vehicles. It is flexible enough to underpin trucks, cars, and everything in between.\nVehicles assembled on this platform will be affordable for the average family \u2014 but also highly efficient, customizable, and fun to drive. And they won\u2019t be stripped down to the bare essentials.\nInstead, these vehicles will be packed with innovative features and new software experiences that set them apart \u2014 and make people want to drive them. Better yet, they\u2019ll improve over time with over-the-air updates that continue to add new capabilities where available.\nFord has been able to realize this vision because of a unique formula. We combined more than 120 years of manufacturing experience with the agility and inventiveness of a start-up \u201cskunkworks\u201d engineering team in California.\nThe result: a new way to assemble vehicles. We\u2019re calling it the Ford Universal EV Production System. [Watch the livestream announcement HERE]\nWe transformed the traditional assembly line into a tree with three main branches. We\u2019ll assemble the front and rear of the vehicle on separate lines. The third branch is the vehicle\u2019s structural battery, which we\u2019ll pre-assemble with seats, consoles, and carpeting.\nThese three branches come together at the end, a process that revolutionizes the factory and simplifies work for our employees.\nNothing is more important than the safety of our hourly workers. Not only will this reimagined manufacturing process be faster and require less space, but better ergonomics will result in less twisting, reaching, and straining, allowing them to stay focused on delivering quality for our customers.\nOur Louisville-assembled midsize electric truck on this Universal EV Platform will debut in 2027. It will have a target starting MSRP at about $30,000, roughly the same as the Model T when adjusted for inflation.\nIt will be as quick as a Mustang EcoBoost, and it will have more passenger volume than a 2025 Toyota RAV4 \u2014 along with a truck bed, smart cargo and frunk solutions.\nFord is going to deliver what no other automaker has been able to: a family of affordable, adaptable electric vehicles that offer multiple body styles for work and play \u2014 including for export \u2014 and whose LFP batteries will be assembled in America, not imported from China.\nWe are investing $5 billion so far in this effort. That includes approximately $2 billion to transform the Louisville Assembly Plant, securing 2,200 jobs while working together with the UAW. At BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, we have committed $3 billion and 1,700 jobs to assemble the LFP batteries these new vehicles will use. That\u2019s nearly 4,000 American jobs.\nThis is a Model T moment. And it\u2019s bigger than Ford \u2014 it's a big win for America\u2019s future and for our customers everywhere.\nI\u2019m excited for the world to see the extraordinary vehicles this Universal EV Platform and new manufacturing system will make possible. Ford\u2019s next century of leadership in innovation starts right now. Let\u2019s go!\nFinancial Consultant\n5mCongrats Jim! \ud83c\udf89This is an exciting time for the Ford Motor Company and the Louisville Plant. There are great employees at the Louisville Assembly Plant.\nSocial Media Account Administrator at Ford with expertise in digital media.\n5mExciting update Jim Farley It will forever remain a great privilege to be part of Ford's #NextGeneration that is transforming and reshaping the future of automobility which is reliable in safety, featured with the latest technology, high in quality, and yet affordable to all our valued customers.\nDriving Growth Through Broadband Mapping and Infrastructure Innovation\n11mI smell another bailout in your future\u2026 hopefully the tow truck\u2019s electric.\nMaterials Manager\n23mBut what about quality?"
