      "feedback": "Actionable edit instructions: reframe the piece as a tight cross‑topic synthesis (macro/policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals) with a formal causal chain (policy pause → trade-flow stability → pricing/inventory discipline → macro/earnings/valuation signals) and a concise watch-list of decisive signals; anchor every causal link to the single source (RHXDOHQQX) and avoid any statements not tied to it; replace generic language with first‑principles tariff‑incidence framing (who bears the cost, and explicit pass‑through assumptions) and supply a fill‑in range for price/margin paths that reflects a 90‑day window and the 30%/10% tariff levels; introduce a clear base case, upside, and downside scenario with explicit catalysts and invalidation points (e.g., renewal beyond 90 days, tariff expansions/exemptions, progress (or lack) in talks, and fresh trade/retailer data) to structure medium/current horizons; quantify what to watch next using only the source’s numbers (90 days; 30%/10% tariffs) and provide placeholders for data‑driven inputs (e.g., pass‑through sensitivity, inventory days, trade‑data shifts) to be filled when data are available; expand the section on watch signals to concrete markers (renewal news date, any tariff action/exemption, retailer price/inventory indicators, trade data prints, and tariff‑headline price moves) and present them as a short, actionable list; ensure every factual claim is cited to RHXDOHQQX, acknowledge that the piece relies on a single source, and avoid implying broader sources or conflicting views; fix any incomplete source text by paraphrasing rather than reproducing trailing fragments (e.g., “inventories d…” should be completed in the synthesis rather than quoted).",
