  "description": "Parent Signature Healthcare announced the cuts almost exactly a year after the fire-damaged hospital reopened.",
  "content": "Brockton is yet another hospital in the state struggling to keep up with mounting costs and subpar insurance reimbursements. UMass Memorial Health, the dominant health care provider in central Massachusetts, has shut down multiple programs in the last year, including an adult psychiatric day program in Fitchburg that\u2019s set to close in October.\n\nSignature Healthcare, the nonprofit that owns Brockton Hospital, announced the cuts last Monday, almost exactly a year after the hospital reopened following a 10-alarm fire that destroyed much of the building.\n\nBrockton Hospital and its parent organization are slashing service lines and about 80 positions, nearly 4 percent of their workforce, amid increasing financial pressures.\n\nSignature said its financial pains are tied not only to the massive fire that shut down Brockton Hospital for more than a year, but also to inadequate Medicaid and Medicare payments that \u201chave not kept pace with the rising cost of care delivery.\u201d Nearly 80% of Signature\u2019s revenue is tied to the federal insurance programs for low-income or disabled adults and for those over 65.\n\nThe health care organization, which also owns a physician group, posted a $42 million operating loss in the first half of fiscal year 2025, according to the most recent state data. Brockton Hospital alone lost more than $34 million during that time.\n\n\u201cThese were extremely difficult decisions that were not made lightly,\u201d Robert Haffey, president and CEO of Signature Healthcare, said in a statement. \u201cWe are deeply grateful for the hard work and commitment of every member of our team.\u201d\n\nHaffrey\u2019s statement said the moves \u201care necessary to ensure that we can continue delivering safe, high-quality, and compassionate care to the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nLayoffs and unfilled job openings account for the workforce cuts, which did not include bedside positions, Signature vice president of marketing and development Beth MacNeill said. The cuts instead were directed at leadership and administrative positions.\n\nSignature will end its bariatric surgery services \u2014 a weight-loss procedure \u2014 in part because of the rise in demand for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy that has replaced demand for surgical options. The organization will also stop its cardiac rehabilitation services.\n\nSweeping Medicaid cuts recently passed into federal law will only make Massachusetts hospitals\u2019 money problems worse, experts said. Already, half of hospitals in the state are operating at a loss, said Alan Sager, a Boston University professor of health law, policy, and management.\n\nMacNeill said that, while Signature is monitoring the looming Medicaid cuts, which could cost Massachusetts providers $3.5 billion, they did not affect the decision to make these recent changes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here almost 130 years and our goal is to be here for the long run,\u201d MacNeill said. \u201cWe recognize after the fire how much our community needs us and we need to make sure we\u2019re here for them.\u201d\n\nMarin Wolf can be reached at marin.wolf@globe.com.",

      "text": "Massachusetts is preparing for a massive outreach effort to help hundreds of thousands of residents who qualify for Medicaid keep their coverage in the wake of new requirements signed into law Friday by President Trump.\nAn estimated 300,000 people are at risk of losing their health coverage over the next decade, while the state could lose some $3.5 billion in funding, two top Massachusetts health officials told the Globe in their first public comments since Republicans passed their massive tax and spending bill.\nState officials are particularly concerned that people with mental illness and substance use disorders will have trouble keeping up with the requirements, while people who rarely go to the doctor could be unaware of changes and will lose their coverage. The newly uninsured will be less likely to schedule routine appointments and more likely to put off treatment of serious conditions, only to end up at hospital emergency rooms in a domino effect that would increase the cost of health care for everyone, officials and health providers said.\n\u201cThis is more about, frankly, Congress putting administrative burdens between people and their health care,\u201d said Mike Levine, assistant secretary for MassHealth, the state\u2019s Medicaid administrator. But, \u201cwe have a really good playbook for getting over those hurdles.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe new law is projected to increase the number of uninsured in the country by 12 million to 16 million by 2034. To offset $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, Congress authorized reductions of about $1 trillion to Medicaid. Most of that would be achieved through a work requirement for enrollees and a mandate that states conduct two eligibility checks annually, instead of one.\nAdvertisement\nTo keep coverage, most able-bodied adults between 19 and 64 years old without dependent children will eventually have to document they are either working, in school, or volunteering at least 80 hours a month.\nThat provision is intended to weed out people shirking employment. In reality, the vast majority of the millions of able-bodied adults on Medicaid are either working, attending school, or have other limiting conditions, according to the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects 5 million enrollees would lose their coverage due to the work rule \u2014 nearly all of them because they will fail to keep up with paperwork requirements and not because they are no longer eligible.\nThe law also scales back the state\u2019s ability to generate revenue for Medicaid through assessments on health care providers. State officials have not yet calculated the full cost of those limitations but said such assessments generated $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2025.\nIn Massachusetts, those at risk of losing coverage include about 200,000 people on Medicaid and another 100,000 who buy insurance through the Massachusetts Health Connector, the health insurance marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act. The new law raises premiums, increases paperwork, and requires consumers to do more to maintain their coverage, the health policy analysis organization KFF reported. The law also makes coverage through the Obamacare marketplaces less accessible to many noncitizen immigrants with legal status.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make those individuals ineligible for coverage writ large, but it takes away the primary subsidy that makes the coverage affordable,\u201d said Audrey Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts connector.\nMassHealth hopes to conduct extensive background checks on many Medicaid enrollees to prove their eligibility without having to directly request information, Levine said. That will include reviewing Department of Revenue records to confirm employment or past claims for references to exempting conditions.\nThose whom the state cannot confirm on its own will be notified their coverage is at risk and will need to prove their eligibility. But MassHealth\u2019s previous experience with mass mailings suggests many will slip through the cracks. So the agency expects to conduct an outreach effort similar one after the pandemic that could include door-to-door canvassing and partnering with community organizations.\nMassachusetts has some time, Levine emphasized. Most of the new Medicaid requirements won\u2019t begin to take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\u201cKeep seeking care,\u201d Levine advised the roughly 2 million MassHealth enrollees. \u201cTake your meds. You don\u2019t need to hoard them. You are not losing coverage tomorrow.\u201d\nAmy Rosenthal, executive director of the Boston nonprofit Health Care for All that helped coordinate the previous outreach, said similar efforts could help many keep their coverage. The organization hopes to be involved in the coming effort.\n\u201cSome of these red-tape barriers are ones that Massachusetts is uniquely positioned to help people overcome,\u201d said Rosenthal.\nNew requirements, though, will be costly for states that will have to update software and add staff, Adrianna McIntyre, assistant professor of health policy and politics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said at a Harvard-hosted media briefing Tuesday.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere is more opportunity for people to fall through the cracks,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen things can\u2019t be done on an automated basis, you need case workers.\u201d\nThe state of Georgia implemented a work requirement as part of a Medicaid expansion that cost $92 million, much of it for tech upgrades, according to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. Meanwhile, just a small percentage of the people eligible for expanded coverage received it, in large part due to the burdensome paperwork requirements.\nThe Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association said Monday the new law will have \u201cstaggering implications\u201d for health care and would lead to \u201cmillions of uninsured people seeking care at underfunded hospitals.\u201d\nThe hospital association said the state\u2019s Health Safety Net fund, which helps cover medical care for uninsured patients, will have a shortfall of $290 million in fiscal 2026, $10 million more than the year before. The association is lobbying state officials to funnel more money into the fund, arguing the current number of uninsured and underinsured people in Massachusetts is already straining resources, \u201cnever mind another 300,000 or more people without coverage.\u201d\nDr. Michael VanRooyen, chair of the emergency departments at Mass General Brigham\u2019s 10 hospitals, said he is worried patients who lose insurance will put off routine care until they have health crises. Then they will end up in already crowded emergency rooms.\n\u201cWe can expect that some people will lose coverage or have lapses in coverage,\u201d said VanRooyen, who is also a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhen that happens, emergency departments become the safety net.\u201d\nA high number of patients who end up in emergency rooms don\u2019t speak English, VanRooyen said. Many are already afraid to seek treatment because of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. Some need treatment for mental illness or substance abuse.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, the increased strain will be accompanied by a loss of important revenue MassHealth relies on to support Medicaid: taxes on health care providers. The new law limits taxes on providers to 3.5 percent, far less than what Massachusetts now imposes.\nLevine said the state doesn\u2019t have enough information yet to determine how hard Massachusetts will be hit financially. He acknowledged the state will likely be forced to cut access to some services, though it was too soon to say what would be affected.\n\u201cThe math is pretty straightforward,\u201d Levine said. \u201cYou need to take a hard look at what we do with the dollars we have available to us.\u201d\nJason Laughlin can be reached at jason.laughlin@globe.com.

      "text": "Despite its love of lobster rolls, clam chowder, and Dunkin\u2019, Massachusetts consistently boasts one of the lowest obesity rates in the country.\nEven so, this relatively lean state had among the nation\u2019s biggest surges last year in residents taking blockbuster weight-loss drugs, and the trend shows no signs of abating.\nAbout 140,400 obese patients in Massachusetts were prescribed medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound in 2024, a 255 percent increase from 2023, according to a Globe analysis of insurance claims data compiled by Real Chemistry, a health analytics firm. That was the third-biggest jump of any state, behind Oklahoma and Rhode Island.\nThe steep increase was fueled by Massachusetts\u2019 broad insurance coverage of the pricey medicines, which are straining the budgets of insurers and employers but delivering life-changing results for many patients.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI finally feel comfortable in my own skin \u2014 my joints don\u2019t hurt and exercise is much easier,\u201d said Kip Kransdorf, 60, a Sudbury management consultant who lost almost 100 pounds in a little over a year on Mounjaro, made by Eli Lilly.\nHis doctor prescribed the medication because Kransdorf was borderline prediabetic and obese. Kransdorf injects it into his thigh weekly. He now weighs 228 pounds, his lowest weight in about 30 years, and says Mounjaro has changed the way he thinks about eating.\n\u201cFood is no longer an obsession,\u201d said Kransdorf, who went from a size 40 waist to a size 34 in pants. \u201cIf anything, I have to remind myself it\u2019s 3 o\u2019clock and I haven\u2019t eaten.\u201d\nHis insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, covers most of the cost of the drug, although he has a co-pay of about $100 a month. The average monthly retail price of the new class of obesity medications is $1,200 without insurance, according to Amy McHugh, a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield.\nAdvertisement\nAbout 7.5 percent of obese residents in Massachusetts are taking the new medications, according to Real Chemistry, which analyzed hundreds of millions of insurance claims nationwide. That\u2019s the seventh-highest proportion in the country.\nAlthough Rhode Island had the second-biggest surge in the use of the drugs, it still has one of the lowest adoption rates, with fewer than 3 percent of obese patients taking the medicines.\nIn some ways, it\u2019s counterintuitive that Massachusetts would have one of the largest increases. The state has the third-lowest obesity rate in the nation, with about 27 percent of the population considered obese, according to federal data.\nInsurance coverage is a key driver of skyrocketing use, experts say. Nearly 68 percent of insured people in the state had plans that covered medications to treat obesity as of last October \u2014 the highest share of any state, according to a report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a prominent philanthropy.\nThe state itself may have played a role in expanding private coverage. Many private insurers in Massachusetts believe the state Division of Insurance expects them to cover the drugs for weight loss, said Lora Pellegrini, chief executive of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans. A spokesperson for the agency, however, said the state has not issued any such directive, though it has warned insurers against making blanket exclusions for the drugs.\nMassachusetts is one of at least 14 states where Medicaid pays for drugs to treat obesity without requiring that patients also suffer from other weight-related conditions. The Medicaid program in Massachusetts, MassHealth, began covering the entire cost of some obesity medicines last January.\nAdvertisement\nThe cost to MassHealth last year was less than $25 million after the insurer negotiated \u201csubstantial\u201d rebates with drug manufacturers and received federal funding, according to MassHealth. At first, MassHealth designated Wegovy and Saxenda as the preferred drugs, but as of Oct. 1 the agency said Zepbound was the medicine it will cover for obesity.\nTo qualify for the medications, private and public insurers have generally required patients to have a body mass index of at least 30, or 27 if individuals have a weight-related medical condition. However, obesity specialists say some insurers have begun to require even higher BMIs.\nThe revolutionary medications are known as GLP-1s because they mimic a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1. That substance stimulates the secretion of insulin and regulates appetite by communicating fullness between the gut and brain.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration approved the first GLP-1 in 2005, for treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the past few years, the agency has approved several GLP-1s for obesity after patients lost 20 percent or more of their body weight in clinical trials.\nFormer Massachusetts Public Health commissioner Christine Ferguson, whose firm, Leverage Global Consulting, created the national insurance landscape report for Robert Wood Johnson, said she wasn\u2019t surprised that public and private insurers in Massachusetts had generous coverage of GLP-1s.\n\u201cMassachusetts tends to be accepting of new technologies and approaches,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cBut I also know that concerns about the impact of the cost to the public sector and private sector will intensify.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIndeed, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts says that the cost of the medications is unsustainable for the insurance company and employers who help pay their employees\u2019 health care expenses. Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state\u2019s largest insurer, spent about $200 million on five GLP-1s in 2024 and expects that to soar to $300 million this year.\n\u201cWe have 2,000 members who are starting these drugs every month,\u201d said McHugh, the insurer\u2019s spokesperson. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find the right balance. We know that these drugs can be life-changing. But we have employers who are saying, \u2018These costs are killing us.\u2019 \u201d\nPoint32Health, the state\u2019s second-largest insurer, also predicts a $100 million increase in its spending on the drugs this year.\nProminent national leaders have criticized the costs of the medicines. Last May, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont warned that \u201cthe outrageously high prices of these drugs have the potential to bankrupt our entire health care system.\u201d\nAnd on Friday, in one of its last acts, the Biden administration said Wegovy and Ozempic would be included on the next round of drugs that Medicare will negotiate for price discounts.\nA spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company that makes both Wegovy and Ozempic, said insurers and pharmacy benefit managers are responsible for the prices consumers pay. He also said weight-loss medicines treat an expensive health problem, citing a Milken Institute estimate that obesity costs the United States more than $1.7 trillion a year.\nTo be sure, doctors who prescribe the drugs and many patients who take them say they are game-changers, although GLP-1s are not without drawbacks. They can have side effects, including constipation and nausea, and studies suggest patients can often regain much of their lost weight if they stop taking them.\nAdvertisement\nDr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who specializes in weight management, said the medicines are \u201cvery effective\u201d in most patients \u2014 even more effective, for some obese people, than bariatric surgery, which shrinks the stomach to limit food intake. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fair number of patients who had surgery for weight loss, regained weight, and are now using GLP-1 medications,\u201d Dushay said.\nAmong the Massachusetts residents delighted with the obesity drugs is Cassie Marsh, 40, who owns a consulting firm in Scituate.\nAfter years of restricting her food intake, riding a Peloton stationary bike daily, losing weight, and then regaining it, Marsh began taking Wegovy about a year ago. She has shed 50 pounds and now weighs about 240. And she\u2019s lost more than weight.\n\u201cThe loss of \u2018food noise,\u2019 as they call it, is wild,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter a lifetime of thinking about food all the time \u2014 what I can eat next, what I\u2019m craving, feeling guilty about what I\u2019ve already eaten \u2014 it\u2019s such a relief. I honestly didn\u2019t know that was possible: to think about food when I\u2019m hungry, then eat something until I\u2019m full, and move on.\u201d\nBut Marsh\u2019s experience has been tempered by a setback with her insurance coverage. At one point, she was only paying $25 a month for Wegovy. But in April, CVS Caremark, the pharmacy benefit manager that covers her prescriptions, told her it had mistakenly authorized coverage of the medication. As it turns out, her plan excludes payment for weight-loss drugs.\nSo Marsh is getting the active ingredient in Wegovy, semaglutide, from a compounding pharmacy that she found online. She pays $350 a month out of pocket. Marsh said it would have cost her $1,600 a month for Wegovy without insurance.\nAdvertisement\nThe FDA said in December that a \u201ccompounded drug might be appropriate\u201d under certain circumstances but consumers should be aware that \u201ccompounded drugs are not FDA approved.\u201d\nMarsh is undeterred.\n\u201cI\u2019m not thrilled about the situation, but at this point I really like the results of Wegovy, and I\u2019m really enjoying the results of the compounded [drug],\u201d she said. \u201cIf my insurance started covering me tomorrow for Wegovy, I\u2019d switch right back.\u201d\nJonathan Saltzman can be reached at jonathan.saltzman@globe.com.
