      "feedback": " The draft successfully anchors the narrative in AI/automation, ROIC–WACC discipline, and tariff dynamics, but it needs a world‑class upgrade in four actionable ways: (1) tighten horizon and structure to the SECTION FOCUS by delivering exactly four Swing Trade lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with uniform 3–6 month time windows (or clearly separate near‑term triggers as a watchlist) and a single, concise Outlook if the asset is tradable; remove non‑swing items (e.g., 0–3 weeks) from the core four lines or relegate them as triggers, and ensure the 4 lines read like: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % with evidence‑backed anchors; (2) harden first‑principles causal chain and scenario structure: state the core causal steps (AI uptake → productivity uplift → household balance sheets and demand for durable cash‑flow assets → ROIC relative to WACC drives valuation multiples) and tie each step to a specific, cited source; where you invoke a numeric claim, attach an in‑text ID (e.g., NL5YYTLF2 for automation exposure or GM for capex data); explicitly spell out 2–3 near‑term catalysts/triggers and 2–3 invalidation points (e.g., tariff escalation, AI capex slowdown, or a regime shift) with concrete thresholds. (3) upgrade quantification and avoid generic platitudes: convert qualitative assessments into numeric anchors (probabilities, ROIC–WACC spreads, EV/multiple ranges, cash‑flow implications) grounded in the sources; for each line, justify the probability with a line‑item reference to the evidence (e.g., “moderate confidence” can be mapped to 28–30% with rationale cited); (4) tighten citation discipline and ensure coverage/consistency: every factual claim or numeric claim must bear an in‑text ID from the SOURCE MATERIAL, reconcile any conflicts across sources (e.g., Ford EV margins vs Nvidia capex momentum) by choosing the more robust, documentable thread and noting the sensitivity; consolidate sources per line so you don’t blur ROIC–WACC dynamics (e.g., NL5YYTLF2, GM, WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, UPV3X2MQ6, 218AGGUXB, SGB2PAZGK, R3WNA7L7A) and place IDs after the facts, not in a separate list. Finally, fix the Outlook line to a single, complete line with Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence, anchored to evidence, and ensure the Swing lines and watchlist use crisp, testable thresholds (e.g., explicit ROIC–WACC targets, tariff milestones, AI capex milestones, Nvidia momentum) rather than open‑ended assertions.",
