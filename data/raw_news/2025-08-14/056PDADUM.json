  "title": "DNC rips JD Vance for fishing with British foreign secretary in latest bizarre attack; Republicans hit back",
  "description": "The RNC rejected Democrats' criticism of Vice President JD Vance and the U.K. foreign secretary's \"illegal\" fishing trip, saying blue donors were wasting their money.",
  "content": "The Democratic National Committee slammed Vice President JD Vance for fishing on a private lake with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy during Vance's official trip to the United Kingdom.\n\nRepublicans were quick to respond to what appears to be the latest in a series of attacks by Democrats against the vice president over outdoor activities and family outings Vance mixes in during his rigorous official travel schedule.\n\nThe DNC War Room issued a press release Wednesday titled \"VACATION VANCE AT IT AGAIN: Vance Fished \u2018Illegally\u2019 With UK Foreign Secretary While Americans Drown in Sky-High Costs.\"\n\nVance and Lammy met at the foreign secretary's official country residence, known as Chevening House, located south of London, on Friday for talks centered on the Israel-Hamas conflict and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nVANCE TO VISIT US TROOPS DURING HIGH-STAKES UK TRIP AHEAD OF TRUMP'S PUTIN MEETING\n\nThey went fishing on the estate grounds before their scheduled meeting. Vance briefly joked to reporters that the \"one strain on the special relationship\" he has with Lammy \"is that all of my kids caught a fish, but the foreign secretary did not.\" The vice president soon delved into more serious topics, including telling reporters that, unlike the U.K., the United States has \"no plans to recognize a Palestinian state\" given the \"lack of a functional government\" in Gaza.\n\nTheir meeting came a week before President Donald Trump's upcoming high-stakes meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.\n\nIn its release on Wednesday, the DNC charged, \"Vance is living it up on his summer holiday \u2014 on the taxpayers\u2019 dime \u2014 all while working families face sky-high inflation and the largest cuts to health care and food assistance in American history.\"\n\nKiersten Pels, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement to Fox News Digital, \"The DNC's donors are OK with funding press releases on a fishing rod license? They might want to pull their money out now before the last of it vanishes down the drain.\"\n\nU.K. outlets reported that Lammy did not buy a valid fishing license before the outing with Vance. In a statement to Sky News, the British Foreign Office said the secretary \"has written to the Environment Agency over an administrative oversight that meant the appropriate licences had not been acquired for fishing on a private lake as part of a diplomatic engagement at Chevening House last week.\"\n\nThe agency reportedly requires rod licenses for fishing of freshwater species in England and Wales for people 13 or above.\n\nDuring his visit to the U.K. last week, Vance also gave a brief address to U.S. troops stationed at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire.\n\nBLUESKY LIBERALS CELEBRATE JD VANCE BEING BOOED WITH HIS KIDS AT DISNEYLAND\n\nThe DNC claimed Vance spoke to troops \"for only six minutes before returning to his $10,000 per week luxury Cotswolds manor.\"\n\nThe release also took issue with Vance allegedly \"using public resources\" earlier this month \"so he could do boating on his birthday.\"\n\n\"Vance fished 'illegally' in the United Kingdom, potentially costing the foreign secretary a \u00a32,000 fine. Vance even had former Chancellor George Osborne plan his vacation\u2019s social agenda, including relaxing in the \u2018Hamptons of the UK,\u2019\" the release said.\n\nThe DNC further charged that Trump and Vance \"ripped away health care from 17 million Americans, slashed food assistance for over 22 million families, and unleashed economic chaos on the American people \u2014 all to give their billionaire friends and donors another round of massive tax handouts.\"\n\n\"While working families struggle to get by, it\u2019s clear where Vance\u2019s loyalties lie \u2014 and it\u2019s not with them,\" the DNC wrote.\n\nThe latest attack comes after Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender, bemoaned Vance's recent visit to Disneyland with his children.\n\n\"Hope you enjoy your family time,\" Newsom wrote on social media. \"The families you\u2019re tearing apart certainly won\u2019t.\"\n\nIn response, Vance wrote, \"Had a great time, thanks.\"\n\nCritics also attempted to paint Vance as entitled after the vice president's security detail had an Ohio river's water levels raised to accommodate a kayaking trip he and his family took to celebrate his 41st birthday. The U.S. Secret Service made the request to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers so that motorized watercraft and emergency personnel could operate safely.\n\nBefore his political career, Vance notably penned an autobiography, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" which describes how he was raised by an opioid-addicted mother in Appalachia, joined the Marines and found success at Yale Law School.\n\nIn a recent interview on \"The Katie Miller Podcast,\" Vance revealed that reserving \"sacred time\" with family allows him to balance his official duties with the duties of being a husband and father.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It\u2019s possible to do it even in my job,\" he said. \"Yes, if like a war breaks out, then sometimes you have to cancel even the sacred time. But we\u2019ve been pretty good about making sure that I have at least a couple of hours with my family every single day.\"",

Their trip also drew a large protest outside the Grand Californian Hotel and along Disney Way over the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.\nAs news about people booing Vance and his family, including his children, spread on the social media site Bluesky, some users encouraged the jeers for the kids to learn that their dad \"is a piece of s---.\"\nDEMS RUN TO THE BLUESKY BLOCK BUTTON AS VANCE TROLLS THEM ON THEIR OWN VIRTUAL TURF FOR SOLID WEEK\n\"People who feel bad for JD Vance\u2019s kids as family gets booed at Disneyland.

      "text": "Vice President JD Vance is poised to meet with U.S. troops at a military installation in England Wednesday \u2013 capping off a high-stakes trip to the U.K. meeting with European leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s Friday meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nVance\u2019s visit to the U.K. comes as he\u2019s sought to lay some groundwork with European allies leading up to Trump\u2019s talk with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska \u2013 and as he\u2019s turned up the heat on them to take greater ownership in the discussions since the conflict is in their backyard.\nThe vice president is slated to visit Royal Air Force Base Fairford, where the U.S. Air Force\u2019s 501st Combat Support Wing and the 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron are based. Vance, a former Marine, is expected to voice appreciation for their service, according to a source familiar with Vance\u2019s prepared remarks.\nVLADIMIR PUTIN TO RETURN TO US FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE\nThe military installation serves as a key location for U.S. Air Force operations and is Air Force Global Strike Command's preferred bomber forward operating base in Europe. U.S. Air Force bombers are regularly deployed to the military base as part of Bomber Task Force Europe 25-2 to integrate with NATO allies and sharpen the service\u2019s global strike capabilities.\nDays after Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, several Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bombers from Fairford conducted joint operations with Germany and Romania over NATO's eastern flank.\nThere are approximately 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in the U.K., according to foreign policy think tank Council on Foreign Relations.\nPrior to addressing U.S. troops, Vance is poised to participate in calls with European leaders to discuss the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Fox News Digital has learned.\nThe calls come on the heels of multiple other discussions with European allies on a series of topics \u2013 including the war \u2013 during Vance\u2019s U.K. visit. Vance has met with multiple U.K. leaders, including U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy.\nA U.S. official told Fox News Digital that Vance and Lammy discussed the relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. and the two allies\u2019 shared economic and technology goals during a meeting on Friday at Lammy\u2019s official residence, Chevening House, in Kent, England.\nSUMMIT WITH PUTIN SET TO TOP TRUMP\u2019S AGENDA THIS WEEK AS UKRAINE WAR TAKES CENTER STAGE\nMeanwhile, the two leaders also discussed the state of affairs in the Middle East, as well as negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. official said.\nThe two also met with representatives of Ukraine and other European allies at Chevening House on Saturday. The meeting led to \"significant progress\" on ending the conflict in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official.\nNo other details were provided regarding the Ukraine talks. It\u2019s unclear if Vance will accompany Trump to Alaska for talks with Putin.\nHowever, Vance said in an interview with Fox News that he communicated to European leaders that the U.S. is \"done with the funding of the Ukraine war business,\" and that European allies must assume more responsibility in ending the conflict.\n\"What we said to Europeans is simply, first of all, this is in your neck of the woods, this is in your back door, you guys have got to step up and take a bigger role in this thing, and if you care so much about this conflict you should be willing to play a more direct and a more substantial way in funding this war yourself,\" Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\nCongress has passed multiple measures to support Ukraine, totaling at least $175 billion in spending to aid Ukraine since February 2022, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\nTRUMP, PUTIN WILL HOLD FIRST IN-PERSON MEETING SINCE UKRAINE INVASION NEXT WEEK IN ALASKA\nMeanwhile, Trump told reporters Monday that he\u2019d know within minutes is Putin actually interested in a deal or not. Still, he said Moscow and Kyiv must come to terms with some \"land swapping\" issues to sign off on a deal.\n\"If it\u2019s a fair deal, I will reveal it to the European Union leaders and the NATO leaders and also to President Zelenskyy,\" Trump said. \"I may say, \u2018lots of luck, keep fighting,\u2019 or I may say we can make a deal.\"\nTrump\u2019s meeting with Putin also comes as his relationship with the Russian leader has soured as peace negotiations have lagged. While the two seemed to remain cordial with each other publicly during Trump\u2019s first administration, that\u2019s changed in recent weeks as Trump has grown fed up with Putin\u2019s tactics.\n\"We get a lot of bulls--- thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,\" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on July 8. \"He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\""

But we've been pretty good about making sure that I have at least a couple of hours with my family every single day.\"\nVance spoke with podcast host Katie Miller for an interview on her new podcast, \"The Katie Miller Podcast.\" Miller is White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller's wife and a former adviser at DOGE.\n\"And sometimes that means, you know, I'm on the phone until 3 a.m. or sometimes that means I'm back in the White House after I put the kids to bed. But just have that sacred time that you protect, that you tune out the phone, you tune out work, and you just focus on your wife and your kids. And that's - I think - that's worked very well for us,\" Vance added.\n'SWISS ARMY KNIFE': INSIDE VP VANCE'S FIRST 5 MONTHS IN OFFICE AS 'ENFORCER' OF TRUMP'S MAGA AGENDA\nVance said that it was possible to carve out time for his family even in his current role.\nMiller also asked the vice president about his day-to-day routine. Miller's interview with Vance is the first conversation she released on her new podcast.\n\"We\u2019ll typically, you know, again, I try to have 6:00 to 8:00 be that time where we have dinner together and just hang out with the kids,\" he said. \"Usually there's something going on from 8 to midnight. And if it's an easy night, you're done by 10:00. And if it's a tough night, you're done at 2:00.\"\nVance told Miller he likes to make his kids breakfast as often as he can.\nSECOND LADY USHA VANCE OPENS UP ABOUT INTERFAITH PARENTING WITH VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE\n\"I actually like to make stuff as much as I can because, again, when you're vice president, you live in a bubble.

Republicans defended Vance, arguing that the DNC's focus on his leisure activities distracts from more pressing issues like inflation and healthcare cuts. Vance's trip included discussions on international conflicts, and he emphasized the importance of family time amidst his official duties.",
