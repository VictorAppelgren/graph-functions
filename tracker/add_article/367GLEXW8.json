The segment also discussed the administration’s push for a government shutdown, the deployment of National Guard troops in cities like Chicago, and the broader geopolitical shift as China, India, Russia, and the U.S. navigate trade and security tensions.  Analysts warned that the legal challenges to tariffs and fiscal policy could reshape U.S. trade strategy and domestic politics in the coming weeks.",
