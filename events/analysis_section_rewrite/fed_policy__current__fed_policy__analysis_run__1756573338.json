      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**\n\n1. **Tariff Ruling Interpretation**  \n   *Issue*: The draft states “Tariff developments add further upward pressure” while the court ruling *blocked* the 10 % tariffs (3952FOSRQ).  \n   *Fix*: Rephrase to: “The ruling removes the 10 % tariff, easing inflationary pressure and slightly easing upward pressure on yields.” Add citation (3952FOSRQ).\n\n2. **Yield Forecast Magnitude**  \n   *Issue*: The draft projects a 10–20 bp rise in the 10‑year yield, but recent data (97MD1FHW8) show only a 2.3 bp rise after core PCE, and market pricing of a September cut (U21K4ALYQ) suggests a neutral‑to‑slight‑fall scenario.  \n   *Fix*: Adjust forecast to “0–5 bp range (flat to modest rise)” and explain the trade‑off: inflation persistence pushes up yields, Fed dovish stance and tariff removal push down. Cite 97MD1FHW8, 3YAQ8JUPL, U21K4ALYQ.\n\n3. **Causal Chain Clarity**  \n   *Issue*: The draft mixes opposing forces without a clear causal path.  \n   *Fix*: Explicitly state:  \n   - Core PCE +0.3 % (July) → upward pressure on yields (97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Fed’s dovish tone & 89 % cut odds → downward pressure (U21K4ALYQ, 3YAQ8JUPL).  \n   - Tariff ruling removes 10 % duty → reduces inflationary pressure → downward pressure (3952FOSRQ).  \n   Net effect: yields likely to stay flat or rise 0–5 bp.\n\n4. **Key Threshold & Invalidation**  \n   *Add*: “A move above 4.30 % would signal a shift toward a tightening stance; a drop below 4.20 % would confirm a dovish trajectory.”  \n   *Invalidate*: “Fed cuts, a core PCE decline below 2.5 %, or a reversal of tariff easing would push yields lower.”\n\n5. **Monitoring Signals**  \n   *Add*: “Watch the Fed’s September policy meeting, any core PCE revision, and any new tariff announcements (e.g., potential retaliatory duties).”\n\n6. **Conciseness**  \n   *Trim*: Remove redundant phrases (“the market’s pricing of a September cut remains high—about 89 % odds—while the 10‑year yield has not yet fallen”). Keep only the essential causal links and numbers.\n\n**Revised Paragraph (example)**  \n> The UST 10‑year yield (ust10y) is likely to remain flat or rise 0–5 bp over the next 0–3 weeks. Core PCE rose 0.3 % month‑on‑month to 2.6 % (97MD1FHW8), supporting a modest upward bias. Fed officials have signaled dovishness and 89 % odds of a September cut (U21K4ALYQ, 3YAQ8JUPL), which exerts downward pressure. The appeals‑court ruling that blocked the 10 % tariff eases inflationary pressure (3952FOSRQ), further dampening yield gains. A move above 4.30 % would signal tightening; a drop below 4.20 % would confirm dovishness. Key catalysts to watch are the Fed’s September policy announcement, any core PCE revision, and new tariff developments.",
