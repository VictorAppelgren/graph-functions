WE ARE ACROSS THE PLATFORMS. CAROL MASSAR ALONG WITH MATTHEW MILLER IN FOR TIM STENOVEC. SO MUCH FOR A QUIET DAY IN AUGUST. MATT: WHAT WE ARE GOING TO GET LATER TODAY, A TON OF MOVEMENT UNDER THE SURFACE BUT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE DOW AND THE S & P, YOU ARE REALLY NOT SEEING THAT MUCH CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK INDEXES OR IN TREASURIES. NOTHING ON THE 10 YEAR, STILL AT 420, WHICH IS A GREAT PLACE TO BE. CAROL: IT'S LIKE NEVER HAPPENED. MATT: WE LOST 101 POINTS ON THE S & P ON FRIDAY. WE CAN DO BACK 92 POINTS YESTERDAY AND NOW, WE ARE DOWN ABOUT 10 SO WE STILL HAVE ABOUT 20 TO GO UNTIL WE GET BACK TO THURSDAY. CAROL: WE HAVE BIG EARNINGS COMING UP AFTER THE CLOSE. SUPERMICRO. THAT IS GOING TO COME UP A LITTLE BIT LATER AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO GET INTO WHAT WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT WHEN IT COMES TO MORE TRADE IN TARIFFS FROM PHARMACEUTICALS TO SEMI TO BIG TRADING PARTNERS LIKE WHERE WE ARE TODAY ON ALL OF THAT. WE ARE GOING TO GET A COUPLE OF YEARS FROM THE C-SUITE. IT CONTINUES, SO IMPORTANT OF FIGURING THE MACRO OUTLOOK. WE HAVE THE COFOUNDER AND CEO, RICK SMITH. THIS IS A COMPANY YOU ARE INTERESTED IN. CAROL: I-8 -- MATT: I HAVE TASED MYSELF, ACTUALLY. NO, THEY WANT TO WORK TOWARDS A FUTURE WHERE BULLETS ARE OBSOLETE OR AT LEAST THAT IS ONE OF THE TAGLINES. CAROL: WE HAVE THE CFO OF THE E-COMMERCE FIRM ALSO OUT WITH EARNINGS. BOTH STOCKS ON THE MOVE IN TODAY'S SESSION. LET'S GET YOU GOING WITH A LOOK ON THE TRADE ON THIS TUESDAY. HERE IS A MORRIS IN FOR CHARLIE PELLETT. -- AMY MORRIS, IN FOR CHARLIE PELLETT. AMY: TEPID DEMAND AND RISING COSTS. THAT SLOWED THE RALLY IN THE STOCK MARKET.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS SCOTT BESSENT TOLD HIM HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE NOMINATED TO REPLACE POWELL AS THE NEXT CHAIR OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR ON-DEMAND NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, SUBSCRIBE TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. I AM AMY MORRIS. WE GO BACK NOW TO BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK DAILY WITH CAROL MASSAR AND MATT MILLER. CAROL: INDIA'S GOVERNMENT IS SCRAMBLING TO CONTAIN THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP THREATENED TO TEAR FACTION WHICH HAS LEFT SOME OFFICIALS IN NEW DELHI REELING. MEANTIME IN TERMS OF WHAT WE GOT FROM THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THIS MORNING ON CNBC, HE TALKED ABOUT MAYBE U.S. TARIFFS AND SEMICONDUCTORS IN PHARMACEUTICAL IMPORTS WHICH WOULD BE ANNOUNCED WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO, THIS ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION REALLY GETS READY TO TARGET KEY ECONOMIC SECTORS IN ITS EFFORT TO REMAKE GLOBAL TRADE. HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID. PRES. TRUMP: PHARMACEUTICALS. THEY MAKE A FORTUNE WITH PHARMACEUTICALS AND THEY MAKE OUR PHARMACEUTICALS IN CHINA AND IRELAND AND EVERYTHING ELSE. PHARMACEUTICALS WILL BE PORTING AN INITIALLY SMALL TARIFF ON PHARMACEUTICALS BUT IN ONE YEAR, 1.5 YEARS MAXIMUM, IT'S GOING TO GO TO 150% AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO TO 200 50% BECAUSE WE WANT PHARMACEUTICALS MADE IN OUR COUNTRY. CAROL: THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLY ON CNBC. ONE THING I WANT TO ADD TO THAT, THE U.S. IS LOOKING AT WAYS TO EQUIP SHIPS WITH BETTER LOCATION TRACKING CAPABILITIES -- CHIPS. MICROCHIPS. MATT: THEY WANT TO PUT AN AIR ATTACK ON THOSE ITSY-BITSY LITTLE MICROCHIPS. GOOD LUCK. CAROL: LIKE THAT APPLE TECH? THIS IS TO CURTAIL THE FLOW OF SEMIS MADE BY THE LIKES OF NVIDIA TO CHINA. TRACKING ALL OF IT, THERE IS A LOT COMING AT US, IS BLOOMBERG NEWS SENIOR EDITOR FOR TECHNOLOGY IN STRATEGIC INDUSTRIES. A LOT GOING ON HERE. GET US UP TO SPEED ON WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE PRESIDENT WHEN IT COMES TO VARIOUS SECTORS AND WHAT WE ARE GETTING IN TERMS OF STILL WAITING FOR TERMS WITH SOME BIG TRADING PARTNERS? > > ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS WE HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP TODAY WAS A TIMELINE FOR BOTH THE PHARMA TARIFFS AND THE LEVEES WE HAVE 1 -- LONG BEEN EXPECTING TO COME ON SEMICONDUCTORS. HE'S BEEN GOING SECTOR BY SECTOR AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN ADDITION TO HIS COUNTRY BY COUNTRY RECIPROCAL TARIFFS BUT HE ALREADY TARGETED THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES WITH LEVEES AIMED AT TRYING TO BOOST MORE PRODUCTION HERE AT HOME AND NEXT, HE'S MOVING ONTO THE DRUG INDUSTRY IN CHIPMAKERS AND THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO GET THEM TO BUILD MORE PLANTS HERE IN THE U.S., SPUR DOMESTIC INVESTMENT AND PLANTS IN PRODUCTION AND TRIED TO BOOST HIRING AS WELL AND PERHAPS ALSO GOOSE SOME EXPORTS IN THOSE AREAS. IT WILL BE A LONG ROAD. EVEN IF HE ANNOUNCES THOSE TARIFFS IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO, IT WILL TAKE YEARS FOR THOSE PLANS TO ACTUALLY BE BUILT FOR COMPANIES TO MIGRATE AND IN THE MEANTIME, A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, BUSINESSES, CONSUMERS WILL FACE THE PROSPECT OF POTENTIALLY HIGHER COSTS BASED ON THE INCREASES IN THOSE INPUTS. REMEMBER, CHIPS ARE IN EVERYTHING. IT'S NOT JUST THE AI ACCELERATORS WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT FROM THE LIKES OF META PLATFORMS AND MICROSOFT CORP. WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR AI BUSINESSES. IT COMES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THINGS LIKE THOSE LIGHT UP SNEAKERS THAT SMALL CHILDREN WEAR. THEY ARE IN CARS AND EVERYTHING SO BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN BRACING FOR THIS AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY READ THE FINE PRINT WHEN THOSE TARIFFS COME OUT TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY EXEMPTIONS WHATSOEVER. WE ARE NOT EXPECTING ANY BUT SOME COMPANIES ARE STILL HOLDING OUT HOPE. MATT: WE JUST REPORT THE NEWS. WE DON'T EDITORIALIZE OR GIVE OUR OPINIONS BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO POINT OUT WHEN SOMETHING MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. THE PRESIDENT ON SUNDAY SAID HE WAS GOING TO LOWER DRUG PRICES FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS BY 1400 TO 1500% WHICH IS MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS DRUG PRODUCERS ARE PAYING CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, HE WANT TO HAVE TARIFFS AT 250% ON IMPORTED PHARMACEUTICALS WHICH IS ALMOST ALL OF THEM, SO HOW DO YOU -- HOW DOES ANY OF THAT MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL? MICHAEL: WELL, THE MASS REALLY IS NOT WORKING WHEN YOU LAY IT OUT JUST ON PAPER. HE EVEN TALKED TODAY ABOUT INCREASING THE DRUG TARIFFS, STARTING SMALL, AND THEN AFTER A YEAR, INCREASING VERY SIGNIFICANTLY TO 150 OR 200%. MATT, IF YOU THINK ABOUT TRYING TO BUILD A DRUG PLANT, IT TAKES YEARS FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. LET'S THINK ON A FOUR OR FIVE-YEAR TIME YEAR TIMELINE AND HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. HE HAS A SENSE OF URGENCY AND HE WANTS TO SEE THESE RESULTS IMMEDIATELY. IN HIS MIND, THESE PLANS SHOULD ALREADY BE UNDERWAY AND HE'S EXPECTING INVESTMENT FROM U.S. TRADING PARTNERS INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION, FROM JAPAN AND OTHERS TO REALLY START PLOWING THAT MONEY INTO THE GROUND AND START GETTING THOSE FACTORIES UNDERWAY. CAROL: ALREADY, WE TALKED ABOUT PUERTO RICO CERTAINLY IN THE PAST BEING A BIG HOME TO BIG PHARMA. THERE'S BEEN SOME BACK AND FORTH THEY ARE BUT WE ALREADY DO IT. IS IT THAT WE HAVE MAXED OUT WHAT WE CAN DO OR WHAT? MICHAEL: PART OF THE PROBLEM IS A LOT OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE U.S. HAVE FOR YEARS BEEN LOWER COST AND THEY HAVE OFFERED THEMSELVES AS A VENUE TO PRODUCE THESE MEDICINES AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AT A FAR LOWER COST AND THAT HAS BENEFITED CONSUMERS HERE IN THE U.S. OVER THE YEARS EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT, PRODUCING A LOT OF THAT MATERIAL HERE IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE BASED ON LABOR COSTS, LAND COSTS, REGULATORY HURDLES, AND OTHER THINGS. SOME OF THE THINGS, THE PRESIDENT HAS PROMISED TO SWEEP ASIDE IN THE LAND USE AND PERMITTING AND RULES-BASED SIDE BUT THERE ARE OTHER STRUCTURAL ISSUES, TOO, AND THAT INCLUDES THE LABOR SUPPLY AND WHETHER THERE IS A WORKFORCE AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR SEMICONDUCTORS AND OTHER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. HAVING ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO CAN MOVE INTO THE PRECISION TOOLING, THE ADVANCED ENGINEERING JOBS IN THE FACTORIES THAT COULD STEP IN AND TAKE THOSE JOBS RIGHT AWAY. AND MATT COME OUT WHEN YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT THE MATH QUESTION, WHEN IT COMES TO CHIPMAKING, ONE OF THE BIGGEST INPUTS IN A NEW PLANT, AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF FACTORIES AT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM WANT TO SEE BUILT ACROSS, YOU KNOW, IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS IN THE U.S., ONE OF THE BIGGEST INPUTS AS THE SEMICONDUCTOR MANY EQUIPMENT ITSELF, THE DEEP ULTRAVIOLET MYTHOGRAPHY MACHINES MADE BY ONE COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND THAT IS IN THE NETHERLANDS. CHIPS TARIFFS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF THOSE MACHINES WHICH RUN 400 MILLION DOLLARS APIECE BY ANOTHER AS MUCH AS $100 MILLION AND FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE PLANNING THOSE PLANTS, IT IS A BIG COST TO HAVE TO ABSORB ALL OF A SUDDEN. MATT: MAYBE THAT'S WHY WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TSMC INVESTMENT IN ITS ARIZONA CHIPMAKING PLANTS, WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN STATED AT 160 $5 BILLION, THE PRESIDENT SAID NOW, IT'S A $300 BILLION INVESTMENT AND HE DOUBLE THAT NUMBER. YOU KNOW, ALSO FOR FUN, I WANT TO ASK ABOUT SHIPS BECAUSE THE IDEA OF PUTTING A TRACKING DEVICE ON, YOU KNOW, OUR ITSY-BITSY MOST ADVANCED AI SEMICONDUCTORS, I MEAN, THE SPACE CONTRACT -- CONSTRAINTS, THE POWER CONSUMPTION, THE SIGNAL INTERFERENCE SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT. > > IS THE GREAT QUESTION AND I ASKED FOLKS IN THE CHIPS INDUSTRY WHETHER THIS IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE AND THEY SAID YES BUT THEY ARE WARY OF DOING IT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. ONE IS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO CREATE THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR POSSIBLY BEING SOME SORT OF THE BACK DOOR TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT OTHER BUYERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THAT, WAIT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS SOME MEANS OF FOLLOWING US, TRACKING US, FINDING US, KNOWING WHERE WE ARE AND MAYBE KNOWING WHAT WE ARE USING THESE CHIPS FOR. NVIDIA CORP., FOR INSTANCE, THE MAKER OF THE MOST ADVANCED AI CHIPS, HAS INSISTED THERE IS NO SUCH BACKDOOR BUT IT IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE, MATT, AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS KEY TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY OF EXPORTING MORE CHIPS AND AI COMPUTER GLOBALLY. CAROL: COULDN'T IT ALREADY BE THERE? JUST SAYING. MICHAEL: THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE ALREADY IN THERE. MATT: I FEEL LIKE IT IS TERRIBLY UNLIKELY. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PUT AS MUCH OF THE TINIEST CIRCUITRY IN THE WORLD ON IT. CAROL: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ALREADY PUT ON THE TINY LITTLE THING QUESTION WHAT AMAZING CAPABILITIES. TRACKING, WOULD THAT BE SUCH A BIG DEAL? THIS IS A LITTLE DEBATE THAT MATCH AND I ARE HAVING. SO APPRECIATE IT. BLOOMBERG NEWS SENIOR EDITOR IN OUR D.C., WE ARE GOING TO STAY IN D.C. AND WE ALSO WANT TO TALK KIND OF BIGGER PICTURE OF THE U.S. RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME OF ITS TRADING PARTNERS INCLUDING WITH INDIA AND WHY IT MATTERS. WE DID SEE THE RUPEE FALL NEAR ITS RECORD LOW AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WOULD RAISE TARIFFS ON INDIAN EXPORTS BECAUSE THE NATION'S PURCHASES OF OIL WITH RUSSIA. IT'S COMPLICATED. SO LET'S TRY AND DEMYSTIFY IT WITH SENIOR GEO-ECONOMICS ANALYST FOR ASIA PACIFIC. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ADAM AND HE JOINS US FROM OUR WASHINGTON, D.C. BUREAU. ALL RIGHT, SO ADAM, WHERE ARE WE WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRESIDENT AND INDIA AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE U.S. TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA? ADAM: SO TO START WITH, I THINK WE HAVE SEEN A VERY CLEAR EVOLUTION IN THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE PAST WEEK OR SO WITH THE PRESIDENT ESCALATING HIS RHETORIC AND INCREASINGLY PUTTING PRESSURE ON INDIA TO COME TO THE TABLE AND BRING A BIGGER PACKAGE FOR TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AND YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED WE ARE SAYING TRADE NEGOTIATIONS HERE AND OBVIOUSLY THE TOP LINE SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO RUSSIA BUT WHILE THERE'S CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, A QUESTION OUT THERE AS TO WHETHER THE PRESIDENT REALLY IS WHAT IS DRIVING HIS ESCALATION ON THIS QUESTION OF INDIAN OIL IMPORTS, OUR TAKE IS THAT THIS IS ABOUT LEVERAGE IN THE NOW INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDIA THAT HAVE BEEN DRAGGING ON SINCE ACTUALLY BEFORE THE APRIL 2 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF RECIPROCAL TARIFFS STARTING IN EARLY FEBRUARY AND YOU KNOW, TRUMP-PENCE WE HAVE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS OUT THERE SEEKING TO ESCALATE, TO GET BETTER LEVERAGE AT THE TABLE AND GET INDIA WHERE HE WANTS THEM. NOW, YOU KNOW, FOR EVERYONE KEEPING TRACK, INDIA HAS EMERGED AS A MAJOR POTENTIAL PARTNER FOR THE UNITED STATES AND A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH BACK ON CHINA'S DOMINANCE IN BOTH MANUFACTURING AND GLOBAL TRADE AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SPENDS A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT TO TRY TO PULL THE INDIANS OUT OF THEIR GENERAL NONALIGNED POSITION INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE CLOSER TO THE UNITED STATES AND DOING THAT THROUGH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY COOPERATION, THROUGH THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN CO-MANUFACTURING INCLUDING OF ADVANCED JET ENGINES ALL DESIGNED TO BRING INDIA WITHIN THE FOLD BUT HERE WE ARE WITH NEW DELHI REALLY SHOCKED BY HOW THE PRESIDENT HAS TURNED THINGS AROUND. MATT: I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS AND IT REMINDS ME TO SOME EXTENT OF IRAN AND CHINA. WE ALL REMEMBER HEARING THE PRESIDENT SAY MULTIPLE TIMES THAT HE DOES NOT MIND IF CHINA BUYS IRANIAN OIL AFTER THE U.S. ATTACKS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN THEY GO TO NEGOTIATE WITH CHINA, THEY ARE ANGRY THAT CHINA IS BUYING IRANIAN OIL. THE PRESIDENT SAID OF THE UNITED STATES -- THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THEY COULD. IN TERMS OF INDIA, WE HAVE PUT SANCTIONS ON RUSSIAN OIL AND SO HAVE THE EUROPEANS AND YET IT HAS BEEN CLEAR TO EVERYBODY ALL ALONG THAT INDIA BUYS THE OIL FROM THE RUSSIANS, REFINES IT, AND THEN TURNS AROUND AND SELLS THOSE REFINED PRODUCTS BACK TO EUROPE. THIS IS KIND OF LIKE AN EMPEROR WEARS NO CLOTHING THING. WAS ANYONE SURPRISED? WHAT'S TO BE CLEAR, THIS ALL -- INDIA'S PURCHASES FALL WITHIN A LOOPHOLE THAT WAS DESIGNED BY THE U.S. AND THE E.U. AS THEY SET OUT THERE SANCTIONS REGIME AGAINST THE RUSSIANS. THESE ARE NOT ILLEGAL PURCHASES SO THE IDEA HERE WAS TO ACTUALLY BOTH CUSHION THE INDIAN -- CHRISTIAN THE BROADER OIL MARKET AND ENSURE STABILITY WHICH WAS A KEY GOAL NOT ONLY FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO OBVIOUSLY OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AND AT THE SAME TIME KIND OF DIVERSIFY SOME OF THE OIL REFINING AWAY FROM CHINA AND DECREASE SOME OF THE PROFITS FROM CHINA AND PUSH THOSE TO INDIA AND ENABLE SOME OF THE OIL TO STILL FLOW TO EUROPE WHICH WAS NECESSARY AS THEY CONTINUE TO TRANSITION AGAINST -- AWAY FROM RUSSIAN FUEL. MATT: BUT THE IDEA WAS TO STOP REVENUES GOING TO VLADIMIR PUTIN SO HE COULD NOT FIND WEAPONS TO ATTACK UKRAINE, RIGHT? AND THEN EUROPE ENDS UP DOING THAT THROUGH THIS LOOPHOLE. ADAM: CORRECT. NOW, THIS DID FALL WITHIN THE PRICE CAP THAT WAS ESTABLISHED TO TRY AND ENSURE THEY WERE NOT GETTING OUTSIZED BENEFITS BUT FROM THE START, THE E.U. AND THE UNITED STATES TOOK A POSITION TO NOT GO AFTER OIL IMPORTS WRIT LARGE BECAUSE OF THE MASS OF RELIANCE NOT ONLY OF EUROPE IN FRONT OF THE GLOBAL MARKET ON RUSSIAN OIL. CAROL: ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT -- HOW IMPORTANT IS THE TRADE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND INDIA? I ASK THAT AFTER HAVING TALKED TO MARK GURMAN YESTERDAY. WE KNOW APPLE IPHONES ARE NOW MADE IN INDIA AND WE HAVE INCREASINGLY SEEN APPLE TRYING TO DIVERSIFY ITS SUPPLY CHAIN SO IT IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF HOW IT MIGHT IMPACT CERTAINLY THE UNITED STATES AND U.S. CONSUMER. WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW? GIVE ME SOME SIZE AND SCOPE SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE. ADAM: HE KIND OF HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD RIGHT THERE WHICH IS THE PROSPECTS OF THE INDIA-U.S. TRADE ARE SIGNIFICANT AND PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK TO PORSCHE -- AS THE UNITED STATES LOOKS TO PUSH A MANUFACTURING AND OTHER PRODUCTION OUT OF CHINA, INDIA HAS BEEN THIS MASSIVE POTENTIAL FOR TAKING OVER PARTICULARLY SOME OF THIS ELECTRONICS PRODUCTION AND FILLING LOTS OF GAPS THAT THE CHINESE CURRENTLY FILL. BUT IN THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH TARIFFS SET TO RISE 25%, THERE IS A REAL RISK TO THE AMOUNT OF GOODS THAT CAN REALLY COME OUT OF INDIA AND BE COMPETITIVE. WE BREAK ECONOMICS SEES A POTENTIAL DROP OF OVER 30% OF EXPORTS FROM INDIA TO THE UNITED STATES WHICH COULD AMOUNT TO A .6% DROP IN INDIAN GDP OVER THE MEDIUM TERM AND THAT IS JUST BASED ON THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REALITY OF THE NEW TARIFF RATES FOR OTHER REGIONAL COMPETITORS LIKE VIETNAM WHICH ARE NOW LOCKED IN AT A LOWER 20% AND MAYBE -- MAY BECOME EVEN MORE COMPETITIVE, FURTHER UNDERMINING THE INDIAN MARKETS I THINK WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN HOW BAD THIS CAN GET IN THE INDIANS ARE CERTAINLY FOCUSED ON STILL GETTING TO A DEAL WHILE HOLDING THE GROUND. CAROL: THE U.S. HAD A TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA OF $43 BILLION LAST YEAR, THE 11TH LARGEST ACCORDING TO FIGURES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. MATT: YOU CAN SEE THAT WE BUY $87 BILLION WORTH OF STUFF FROM THEM AND THEY BUY 45 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STUFF FROM US SO NOT A NEGLIGIBLE TRADING PARTNER. CAROL: AND AGAIN, THIS IS GOODS BECAUSE WE HAVE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THE SERVICES THE UNITED STATES HAS WITH THE WORLD SO WE HAVE GOT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT TRADE IS MADE UP OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, ADAM, SENIOR ECONOMICS ANALYST FOR ASIA PACIFIC ABENBERG ECONOMICS JOINING US FROM D.C. AND WHEN WE COME BACK, WE ARE TALKING WITH THE CFO. THAT'S NEXT. AMY: 2:20 ONE ON WALL STREET. I AM AMY MORRIS. IN THE U.S. SERVICES SECTOR STAGNATED BECAUSE OF CAP A DEMAND IN RISING COSTS. MARKETS RESPONDED AS THE STOCKS WIPE DOWN GAINS. WE TOOK MARKETS FOR YOU ALL DAY LONG AT BLOOMBERG. THE S & P 500 DOWN .3%, NASDAQ DOWN .4% AND THE DOW IS DOWN .1%. MY GOODNESS. 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD AT 4.2 PERCENT. THE TWO YEAR YIELD AT THREE POINT 72 PERCENT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PLANS TO BORROW AN UNPRECEDENTED $100 MILLION IN A SINGLE TREASURY DEBT SALE THIS WEEK. THE TREASURY HAS BEEN BOOSTING SALES TO REBUILD ITS CASH BALANCE AFTER THE DEBT CEILING WAS LIFTED AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS U.S. TARIFFS ON SEMICONDUCTOR AND PHARMACEUTICAL IMPORTS WOULD BE ANNOUNCED WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. FOR ON-DEMAND NEWS, 24 HOURS A DAY, YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. I AM AMY MORRIS. LET'S GO BACK TO BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK WITH CAROL MASSAR AND MATT MILLER. CAROL: WE HAVE BEEN REALLY LUCKY AND CHECKING IN ON THE C-SUITE THIS WEEK AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO BE BECAUSE SO MANY COMPANIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE GLOBE ALSO REPORTING THE RESULTS. SHARES OF RICARDO LIBRE ARE TRADING UP ABOUT 2.8% IN TODAY'S SESSION. THEY WERE LOWER IN THE PREMARKET BUT CERTAINLY IN THE REGULAR SESSION, INVESTORS COMING IN AFTER THE E-COMMERCE FIRM POSTED EARNINGS THAT MISSED ESTIMATES AS THE COMPANY RAMPS AT MARKETING SPENDING TO RECRUIT MORE USERS. A MOVE TO LOWER THE THRESHOLD FOR FREE SHIPPING, BRAZIL WITH PROFITABILITY. THEY SEE STRATEGIC VALUE IN THESE INITIATIVES, SAYING THEY WILL HELP SHORE UP LONG-TERM GROWTH EVEN AS THEY WEIGH ON MARGINS FOR THE TIME BEING SO LET'S GET INTO THE BUSINESS. TIME FOR OUR CFO BRIEFING. WITH US IS THE CEO OF THE E-COMMERCE FIRM. HE JOINS US FROM MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY, AND HE WILL BE FEATURED, WE SHOULD POINT OUT, IN THE UPCOMING ADDITION OF THE NEWSLETTER WHICH YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR ABENBERG.COM/CFO BRIEFING AND ALSO WITH US IS THE NUMBER OF NEW SENIOR EDITOR WHO WRITES THE BLOOMBERG CFO BRIEFING NEWSLETTER. SHE IS HERE IN STUDIO. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE WITH NINA, MATT, AND MYSELF. TALK TO US ABOUT THE QUARTER BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM THAT INVESTORS, ANALYSTS WEIGHING IN. THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS ON INVESTMENTS AND WHAT YOU ARE DOING, HOW THEY WILL PROVIDE SOME FUTURE GROWTH. BUT WELCOME, WELCOME. > > THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. HOW ARE YOU? WE HAD A GREAT QUARTER. REVENUE GREW BY 34% YEAR ON YEAR WITH A RECORD-BREAKING INCOME OF 820 $5 MILLION. MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT, WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR USER BASE ON OUR COMMERCE AND FINTECH PLATFORM, ON THE COMMERCE PLATFORM GREW BY 25% YEAR ON YEAR. IT GREW BY 30%. THE VOLUME GREW BY A 9%. IN BRAZIL, 32% IN MEXICO. INVOKE CASES, VERY STRONG OPERATING METRICS. AS I JUST SAID, THIS WAS A QUARTER OF INVESTMENTS. WE OPENED TWO NEW FULFILLMENT CENTERS TO ADD TO WHAT WE HAD THROUGHOUT THE REGION. WE ALSO MADE A BIG CHANGE IN TERMS OF LOWERING THE THRESHOLDS IN BRAZIL TO THE STRATEGIC MOVE WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR MANY YEARS AND IT'S PAYING OFF VERY NICELY AND WE GOT THE INVESTMENT ARE VERY EXCITED NOT ONLY ABOUT THE RESULTS BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT, ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE OPPORTUNITY WE HAD AHEAD OF US BOTH IN COMMERCE AS WELL AS FINTECH. > > TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT, YOU MENTIONED THE THRESHOLD FOR I THINK TO YOU MISSING ESTIMATES FOR NET PROFIT AS WELL AS CORE EARNINGS. I'M WONDERING AS THE CFO OF A FAST GROWING BUSINESS, HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT PROFITABILITY AND HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE SHORT TERM VERSUS THE LONG-TERM? MARTIN: I REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU A FEW QUARTERS AGO. WE TRIED TO BALANCE SHORT-TERM PROFITABILITY WITH GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE AHEAD OF US SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO NOT MISS THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT COMMERCE, PENETRATION OF E-COMMERCE AND THAT AMERICA IS ROUGHLY 15% COMPARED TO MAYBE 25%, 30% OR 40% IN THE U.S. SO IT'S PLENTY OF ROOM TO CONTINUE GROWING. SAME THING HAPPENED. MOST PEOPLE IN LATIN AMERICA HAVE NOT BEEN FINANCIALLY INCLUDED BY THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM SO WE SEE A LARGE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT ON THE FINTECH SIDE OF THE BUSINESS. AT THE SAME TIME, TO CAPTURE THE OPPORTUNITY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS. SOME OF THOSE INVESTMENTS MIGHT PUT SHORT-TERM PRESSURE BUT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. WHEN WE LOWER THE THRESHOLD, IT DOES PUT PRESSURE IN THE SHORT TERM. WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE 2017 WHEN WE INTRODUCE FREE SHIPPING IN BRAZIL. AT THAT TIME, THE THRESHOLD WAS 120. WE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO 20 AND I WE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO 20 SO WE HAVE PROVED THAT BY LOWERING THE THRESHOLD, THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST -- THE MOST -- ANYTHING ONLINE FOR PEOPLE SO EVENTUALLY, THAT TRANSLATES INTO PROFITS. SO I THINK IT'S A STRATEGY THAT HAS PAID OUT FOR US. WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE DOING. > > HE MENTIONED BRAZIL. IT IS AN INTERESTING MARKET JUST IN THE CURRENT TARIFF DEBATES THAT WE ARE SEEING WITH THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT SO FAR HOLDING OUT TO TRUMP AND BASICALLY NOT GIVING IN ON THE TRUMP TARIFF SUGGESTIONS FOR BRAZIL. JUST WONDERING, HOW FAR ARE YOU SEEING THAT PLAY OUT IN TERMS OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMER SPENDING? ARE YOU SEEING ANY IMPACT IN COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL? I KNOW YOU ARE ALSO DOING BUSINESS IN MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES, ALL OF WHICH WILL FACE HIGHER TARIFFS AS PART OF THE U.S. RENEGOTIATION OF TARIFFS AROUND THE WORLD. MARTIN: YES, THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE MONITORING CLOSELY. OBVIOUSLY, WE DO NOT EXPORT IT TO THE U.S. SO THERE IS NO DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS BUT I CAN'T HAVE'S -- IT CAN HAVE SECONDARY EFFECTS AS YOU MENTIONED. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT SO FAR. WE ARE GROWING BY 29% OF GME IN BRAZIL. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY INVESTED IN MORE THAN THAT -- OUR CREDIT CARD BOOK HAS GROWN BY 118%. THE PROFITABILITY OF THE ASSET QUALITY CONTINUES TO BE VERY SOLID IN BRAZIL SO WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY, YOU KNOW, ANY DETERIORATION ON MICRO CONSUMPTION BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE MONITORING CLOSELY. MATT: THAT MILLER IN THE STUDIO WITH THE LADIES. I WAS REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THE GROWTH AND I WONDER IF YOU ARE WATCHING CLOSELY FOR SIGNS OF CREDIT STRESS THERE BECAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE LIKE 90% GROWTH. MARTIN: THAT IS CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. OBVIOUSLY, WHEN WE LOOK AT CREDIT, WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. WE ARE VERY CAREFUL IN THE WAY WE MANAGE CREDIT. SO THE FIRST THING WE LOOK AT AS THE -- IS THE HEALTH. WE SAW THAT IT IS AT THE LOWEST NUMBER SINCE WE HAVE BEEN DISCLOSING THE METRIC. THE MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY IS ALSO IMPROVING QUARTER ON QUARTER SO WE SEE VERY HEALTHY SIZE IN TERMS OF OUR BOOK. THE REASON YOU ARE SEEING 91% GROWTH IN OUR BOOK IS BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING GOOD RESULTS IN TERMS OF OUR MODELS. IN THE QUALITY OF OUR CREDIT BOOK CONTINUES TO BE VERY HEALTHY. WE WILL SLOW DOWN AND BECAUSE WE ARE VERY, VERY -- WE ARE TALKING WITH MARTIN DILLOW SANTOS, CFO, JOINING US FROM URUGUAY. WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS THE LARGEST COMPANY, LATIN AMERICA'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY IF YOU THINK ABOUT MARKET CAP. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FINTECH. THE HEALTH OF THAT PORTFOLIO. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US MORE WHEN IT COMES TO THE MIX OF CUSTOMERS IN THAT PORTFOLIO? MARTIN: WE ARE SEEING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE ECONOMIC SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. WE ARE QUIET, MOST OF OUR CREDIT USERS FROM THE MARKETPLACE. ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE USING OUR MARKETPLACE. THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDICAL -- THE INFORMATION THAT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ON OUR MARKETPLACE. WE USE THAT INFORMATION THROUGH AI AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO ESCORT PEOPLE. VERY ACCURATE AT PREDICTING CREDIT RISK. YOU WILL FIND PEOPLE OF ALL SOCIAL LEVELS WITHIN OUR ECOSYSTEMS. HALF OF THE PEOPLE WE OFFER CREDIT TO IS FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEY NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT. ALSO, THE FINTECH BUSINESS IS MOVING TO US BECAUSE WE OFFER -- THAN TRADITIONAL BANKS. > > IN TERMS OF EARNINGS, YOU POINTED OUT THE IMPACT OF THE ARGENTINE PESO. WE SAW VARIOUS CHANGES IN ARGENTINA IN RECENT MONTHS, INCLUDING MAKING CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S ASH COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN BASICALLY THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL AND IN OFFICIAL RAYS FALLING APART. WONDERING HOW THAT IS IMPACTING YOUR BUSINESS AND ARE YOU CHANGING YOUR HEDGING STRATEGY FOR ARGENTINA? > > YEAH, I THINK ARGENTINA, WE CONTINUE TO SEE A BIG RECOVERY. BY 30% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, 35% IN LOCAL CURRENCY OR 35% IN DOLLARS. THE ITEMS ARE RULED BY 46%. A STRONG RECOVERY AS WE SEE INFLATION COMING DOWN. ALSO, THE FX MARKET IS NORMALIZED. THE OPEN ECONOMIES ARE BRINGING MORE PRODUCTS FROM THE U.S. INTO ARGENTINA AS WELL. MOST HAVE PERFORMED EXTREMELY WELL IN ARGENTINA AND WE ARE HAPPY WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING. > > IMAGINE YOU RAN CREDIT BEFORE. HE RAN ALSO A STRATEGY AT INTUIT. SO YOU KNOW STRATEGY UP AND DOWN. I WANT TO KNOW YOUR STRATEGY REGARDING AD REVENUE. A SURGE OF 38%. IS IT A FUTURE PROFIT CENTER, OR DO YOU VIEW THAT MORE AS A TOOL TO DRIVE YOUR CORE MARKETPLACE GROWTH? > > BUSINESS IS ROUGHLY A ONE MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS, 38%. A PROFIT BUSINESS FOR THE COMPANY. IT HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL GOING FORWARD. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH THE ECOSYSTEM, WE HAD MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE, 68 MILLION MONTHLY USERS FOR THE FINTECH PLATFORM. THE NUMBER OF EYEBALLS WITHIN LATIN AMERICA, WE ARE THE THIRD REGIONAL PLATFORM. THAT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE DISTRIBUTING. WE CAN LEVERAGE THE FIRST PART OF THE INFORMATION FOR OUR USERS. THE TARGET AND MARKETING CAMPAIGNS. I THINK IT IS MORE FUTURE TO -- ADVERTISING BUSINESS. WE ARE HAVING IT FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, PLENTY GOING FORWARD. > > ABOUT 20 SECONDS, LOOKING TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF, A GLOBAL CEO. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE GLOBAL OUTLOOK? > > OPERATING IN LATIN AMERICA, DEPENDING ON THE CALENDAR, HAVING SOME SITUATIONS WITH SOME OTHERS, BETTER CONDITIONED. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE TREND OF PEOPLE MOVING ONLINE IS SO MUCH STRONGER. WE HAVE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD OF US. WE ARE OFFERING EVERYTHING IN LATIN AMERICA, THE FINTECH PRODUCTS. FINANCIAL INCLUSION THROUGHOUT THE REGION. WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC. > > SO GLAD WE CAN GET TIME WITH YOU. OUR TEAM DILLOW SANTOS, CFO OF MERCADO LIBRE. GIVE HIM A BIT OF A PROMOTION.

NOW BACK TO BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK DAILY WITH CAROL MASSAR AND MATT MILLER. > > THANK YOU, AMY MORRIS IN FOR CHARLIE PELLETT. KEEPING A WATCH ON SHARES OF AXON. GAINING AS SHY AS 19%, THE MOST SINCE FEBRUARY. ENOUGH TO REACH A RECORD INTRADAY HIGH. THE STOCK IS JUST UNDER 15%. AFTER THE MAKER OF TASERS AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT REPORTED SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS-PER-SHARE THAT TOPPED EXPECTATIONS. STRONG BOOKINGS FOR THE AI PLAN. > > LOOK AT THE FIVE-YEAR CHART. WHO CARES ABOUT TODAY, IT IS UP 825% OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. > > IT HAS HAD QUITE A RUN. COMING OFF OF EARNINGS, SEVERAL ANALYSTS -- ANALYSTS ARE RAISING THEIR PRICE TARGET. UP MORE THAN 40% YEAR-TO-DATE. WE HAVE RICK SMITH, FOUNDER AND CEO OF AXON, TO TALK ABOUT THE BUSINESS AND THE OUTLOOK. > > I'M HAVING A GOOD DAY. > > TALK ABOUT THE BUSINESS. WHO IS BUYING, WHAT IS GOING ON? WE TALKED ABOUT TASERS, BUT YOU HAVE VIDEOS TO REMIND US YOU ARE NOT JUST ABOUT THAT, YOU ARE ABOUT MORE. > > THAT IS WHY WE CHANGED THE NAME OF THE COMPANY. A BRAND ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LESS LETHAL WEAPONS, THAT IS WHERE WE STARTED. IT GOT US INTO BODY CAMERAS. TO BASICALLY HELP PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND POLICE BY PRESERVING A FACTUAL RECORD OF WHAT THEY DID. AND FROM THERE WE HAVE CLOUD SOFTWARE TO MANAGE THE DATA AND THE BUSINESS EXPLODED. WE ARE THE MARKET LEADER IN IN CAR VIDEO, BODY CAMERAS, RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, DRONES AND ROBOTICS THROUGH THEIR PARTNERSHIPS OR FIRST PARTY THINGS THAT WE DO, THE LARGEST VIRTUAL REALITY TRAINING BUSINESS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. WE ARE EXPANDING INTO ADJACENT MARKETS. ANY ENTERPRISE THAT HAS A SECURITY FUNCTION HAS TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH LOCAL POLICE. EITHER THROUGH AN OLD-SCHOOL 911 CALL OR A NUMBER OF TOOLS ON OUR PLATFORM THAT ALLOW YOU IF YOU ARE A SCHOOL OR BUSINESS TO SHARE YOUR SECURITY CAMERAS IN AN EMERGENCY WITH POLICE. IF YOU HAVE AN ACTIVE SHOOTER, YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO DESCRIBE IT OVER THE PHONE, YOU CAN GET VIDEO ACCESS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AT YOUR CONTROL AND SHUT IT OFF WHEN IT IS NOT NECESSARY. WE ARE LAYERING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON TOP OF THIS NETWORK OF SENSORS SO WE CAN MAKE EVERYONE SAFER. ALSO IN A WAY THAT IS VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT PRIVACY TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING THIS IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT CREATE HOW TO CONTROL SURVEILLANCE. > > YOUR INVESTORS WILL KNOW. ANALYSTS WILL KNOW. NOT EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH YOUR FOUNDING STORY. WHICH IS INTENSELY PERSONAL. GIVE US A QUICK RECAP OF THAT AND TELL ME IF YOU STILL SEE THE COMPANY'S MISSION, CUTTING BELOW -- POLICE GUN DEATHS AS REALISTICALLY ACHIEVABLE AND SAFE THIS DECADE. > > > > I STARTED IN BUSINESS SCHOOL IN EUROPE AND I WAS HAVING DINNER WITH SOME PEOPLE -- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR HOMETOWN. THEY SAID I WOULD NEVER GO TO AMERICA BECAUSE OF THE GUN VIOLENCE. I SAID IT IS NOT LIKE YOU SEE ON TELEVISION. WHEN ASKED IF I KNOW ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN SHOT AND KILLED. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THERE ARE TWO GUYS FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM -- WE WERE NOT SUPER CLOSE FRIENDS, BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS ALL OF US, I BET EACH OF YOU KNOW SOMEONE IN YOUR IMMEDIATE CIRCLE WHO HAVE BEEN SHOT AND KILLED. THIS PROBLEM TOUCHES EVERYBODY. I THINK I KNOW FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE SHOT AND KILLED. IT STRUCK ME AS A BIZARRE STATE OF THE UNIVERSE THAT THE WAY WE PROTECT OURSELVES IN THE 1990'S, MUCH LESS 2025, IS SHOOTING BULLETS AT PEOPLE. WE WERE DOING THAT WITH PIRATES IN THE 1600S. WE ARE ON A MISSION TO MAKE THE BULLET OBSOLETE BY MAKING THE -- BETTER TECHNOLOGY, SIMILAR TO CAPTAIN KIRK'S FAZER, FROM STAR TREK. IF WE HAVE THAT WEAPON IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SHOOT ANYBODY. WE ARE GETTING CLOSE. IT IS NOT WIRELESS, BUT WE ARE APPROACHING A LEVEL OF RELIABILITY WHERE WE HAVE COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. TALKING ABOUT USING THE TASER INSTEAD OF A GUN. IN THE U.S., WE WOULD NOT SUGGEST IT. BUT WE CAN SUGGEST THE TASERS CAME TO A POINT WHERE YOU CAN USE IT FIRST, IT IS YOUR PRIMARY WEAPON AND THE GUN WOULD BE A BACKUP FOR THE MOST EXTINCT CASES. IF WE ACHIEVED IT, WE THINK WE CAN CUT DONE DEATHS BY 50%. > > AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, WE ARE FEELING SENSITIVE IN NEW YORK CITY FOLLOWING THE ACTIVE SHOOTER OUT OF THE OFFICE BUILDING ON PARK AVENUE LAST WEEK WHERE INDIVIDUALS LOST THEIR LIVES AS WELL AS A POLICE MAN LOST HIS LIFE. TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS YOU ARE SEEING AS A RESULT OF YOUR DEVICES THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER FOR POLICE FOLKS AND SECURITY FOLKS. > > WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN THE CURVE, WE ARE NOT SEEING NUMBERS COMING DOWN BECAUSE THE OVERALL TREND IS INCHING UPWARD. THIS YEAR IT IS LOWER THAN LAST YEAR. IT IS PREMATURE FOR US TO SAY IT IS THAT YET. OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS I HAVE DONE THIS, THERE'S AROUND 300,000 USES WHERE POLICE COULD HAVE BEEN LEGALLY JUSTIFIED TO USE LEGAL FORCE BUT WERE RESOLVING IT WITH THE TASER INSTEAD. THIS NEXT TWO YEARS IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. UP UNTIL NOW, TASER WEAPONS HAVE BEEN LARGELY USED, NOT REALLY IN THE MOST CRITICAL SITUATIONS, THEY WOULD CAPTURE SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT AN IMMEDIATE RISK. WE INTRODUCED A COUPLE OF KEY TECHNOLOGIES WE ARE TESTING IN THE FIELD. DETAILS WE THINK MOVE OUT EFFECTIVE RELIABILITY INTO THE 99% AREA. AT WHICH POINT WE THINK IT BECOMES REASONABLE THAT POLICE WOULD BEGIN USING TASER AS THEIR PRIMARY FIRST WEAPON. ALWAYS KEEPING THE GUN AS A FALLBACK. > > YOU MENTIONED BUSINESS SCHOOL IN EUROPE, I GUESS YOU WENT TO SCHOOL IN BELGIUM BEFORE CHICAGO. YOU STUDIED FIRST NEUROSCIENCE AT HARVARD. HOW DOES THAT BACKGROUND INFLUENCE YOUR DECISIONS TODAY AT A COMPANY THAT TOUCHES SO MANY NERVES? > > THE WHOLE NAME OF THE COMPANY IS A BIT OF A NEURO-BIO GEEK SPEAK. IT IS THE NAME OF THE LONG NERVE FIBERS THAT CONNECT YOUR BRAIN TO THE MUSCLES. INDEED, IT TOUCHES A NUMBER OF WAYS. WHEN I FIRST WROTE MY COLLEGE APPLICATION, SHOWING MY SON, I HAD A COPY OF IT. THEY ASKED WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE. I SAID I WANTED TO BUILD ROBOTIC LIMBS. IT WAS LIKE LUKE SKYWALKER'S ROBOTIC HAND. I LOVE THE IDEA OF A MACHINE THAT COULD INTERFACE AND BECOME A PART OF YOU. MY INTEREST ARISING IN GUN VIOLENCE, IT TOOK A DIFFERENT TURN. INSTEAD OF BUILDING A MACHINE YOUR BRAIN CAN CONTROL, I BUILD MACHINES THAT CAN CONTROL YOUR BODY THROUGH YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM. THAT IS WHAT A TASER DOES. WE PLUG IN, TUNE IN THE ELECTRICITY SO IT OVERWHELMS COMMUNICATION AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SEIZURE BECAUSE WE ARE FLOODING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH ELECTRICAL ENERGY. I SAW FIVE PEOPLE VOLUNTEER IN MY OFFICE THIS MORNING. IT IS A TEMPORARY EFFECT BUT DEBILITATING. WE THINK ABOUT THE OTHER PARTS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND WE GOT INTO THE CAMERA BUSINESS WE REALIZED THE CAMERAS ARE KIND OF INTERESTING BUT IT IS NOT MERELY THE BUSINESS IF WE CAN CONNECT ALL OF THE SENSORS TOGETHER AND BEGIN TO THINK OF THIS LIKE A GIANT NEURAL NETWORK. LIKE AN NYPD WITH 35,000 OFFICERS. WE CAN BEGIN TO HAVE LIVE DATA FEEDS THAT CONTROL IN MORE REAL-TIME TO IDENTIFY THIS SITUATION IS ESCALATING, LET'S SEND REINFORCEMENTS BEFORE THE OFFICER CALLS OVER THE RADIO. OR WE MIGHT IDENTIFY THINGS LIKE THIS IS SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE HORRIBLE POLICING SITUATIONS LIKE GEORGE FLOYD OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, I BELIEVE ANY ONE OF THOSE COULD BE DETECTED WITH AI RUNNING ON THE AUDIO VIDEO FEED OF CAMERA. THAT IS A CAPABILITY THAT WE ARE BUILDING NOW. WE DO HAVE LIVE FEEDS NOW, BUT TO HAVE LIVE FEEDS BEING AI MONITORED IN REAL TIME WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. I THINK THAT WILL BE A HUGE BOOM TO MAKE POLICING MORE EFFECTIVE, SAFER, AND HELP AGENCIES IDENTIFY IF A SITUATION IS SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL TO INTERVENE NOW INSTEAD OF PROSECUTING SOMEBODY TOMORROW IF SOMETHING WRONG IS HAPPENING. > > HOW MUCH OF YOUR BUSINESS, IT DOES FEEL LIKE THERE WILL BE MUNICIPALITIES UNDER PRESSURE IN TERMS OF FUNDING. I'M WONDERING HOW THAT PLAY ON YOUR COMPANY > > THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT IS ENTERPRISE. THE ENTERPRISE SECURITY IS TWO OR THREE TIMES LARGER THAN PUBLIC POLICING IN THE U.S. IN TERMS OF MANPOWER. THERE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY. IF I COME BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT MUNICIPAL POLICING, I REMEMBER THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS AND OTHERS. WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS IF YOU LOOK AT A POLICE AGENCY, THE MAJORITY OF THEIR SPEND IS ON COPS, CARS, AND GAS. 90% OF THEIR EXPAND. THE TECH SPEND IS A SMALL PORTION OF THEIR OVERALL BUDGET. AND WHEN BUDGETS GET COMPRESSED, WHAT WE SEE IS THEY LOOK TO TECHNOLOGY WHERE THEY SAY WE NEED TO GET MORE EFFICIENT, WE CANNOT JUST THROW BODIES AT THINGS. OUR FIRST MAJOR AI PRODUCT USING GENERATIVE AI IS A SERVICE CALLED DRAFT ONE. WE TAKE YOUR BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE, WE FEED IT THROUGH AN AI MODEL AND WE JUST USED THE AUDIO, WE DON'T NEED THE VIDEO. WE USE THE AUDIO TRACK AND WE DO THE FIRST DRAFT OF YOUR POLICE REPORT. POLICE INTERACTIONS ARE PRETTY STANDARD. WHAT IS YOUR NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, DO YOU KNOW WHY I STOPPED YOU? FROM THAT YOU INSTRUCT -- EXTRACT INFORMATION TO PUT THE STRUCTURED REPORT NARRATIVE TOGETHER TO ABOUT THE 82% COMPLETION. THAT BASICALLY MEANS WE ARE CUTTING THE AMOUNT OF TIME POLICE SPEND ON BUREAUCRACY BY 60% OR 70%. HUGE BECAUSE ONLY 14% OF POLICE DEPARTMENT'S ACROSS THE NATION ARE ACTUALLY FULLY STAFFED. IN THE MOST RECENT SURVEY, 75% OF POLICE SAID THEY WANT AI TO HELP THEM OUT. IT SEEMS -- IT IS NOT A PUN ON YOUR NEUROSCIENCE DEGREE, BUT SEEMS I CAN NO-BRAINER. > > I'M A LITTLE BIASED, BUT I THINK SO. > > YOU TALKED ABOUT, ROBOTICS CAME UP AND YOU TALKED ABOUT AN INTEREST. > > LUKE SKYWALKER WITH HIS HANDS. IS ROBOTICS SOMETHING YOU ARE THINKING IN TERMS OF SECURITY GOING FORWARD? > > STAY TUNED. THE SOLUTION TO THE AMERICAN GUN VIOLENCE PROBLEM AND MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE GAME. TODAY WHEN AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SHOWS UP, THEY HAVE NO ILLUSIONS THEY WILL COME OUT OF IT ALIVE OR THEY WANT TO GO DOWN IN SOME SICK TWISTED VISION OF A GLORIOUS GUNBATTLE WITH THE POLICE. IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, WE ARE GOING TO DENY THEM THAT. IF YOU SHOW UP WITH A GUN SOMEWHERE, WE WAS IT IN QUICKLY WITH A ROBOT USING LESS LETHAL FORCE, YOU WILL BE ARRESTED AND UNDER CONTROL VERY QUICKLY AND WE WILL DENY THEM THE ENTIRE MOTIVATION TO GET IN GUN FIGHTS. I THINK WE CAN DO THINGS WITH DRONES AND ROBOTICS YOU COULD NEVER DO WITH PEOPLE, AND WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO LETHAL FORCE. WE ARE MAKING A BIG PLAY IN THAT SPACE. > > SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE TO COME BACK SOON. RICK SMITH, BE WELL. FOUNDER AND CEO OF AXON JOINING US. WE SEE THE STOCK MOVE IN A BIG WAY FOLLOWING THE LATEST RESULTS. > > GOING TO ADD HIM TO THE LIST OF GUESTS. I STEAL FROM YOUR SHOW AND USE ON MY SHOW. > > DO NOT HAVE THAT COHOST ANYMORE, DONE. > > WHAT A STORY. THE STOCK CHART IS AMAZING. THE STORY BEHIND IT. HE STARTED IT IN 1993. HE HAS BEEN AT THIS FOR 32 YEARS. > > THE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT BACKGROUND'S, DOCTORS WHO ARE ENGINEERS LOOKING AT THE BODY IN A DIFFERENT WAY. HERE HE IS IN TERMS OF HIS BACKGROUND AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BRAIN WORKS AND THE IMPACT OF THINGS. HE IS OURS. JUST KIDDING. GREAT CONVERSATION. I'M CAROL MASSAR ALONG WITH MATTHEW MILLER. LET'S LOOK AT SOME STOCKS ON THE MOVE. WITH US IS ISABEL LEE IN STUDIO. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT VRTX. > > IT IS DOWN ALMOST 20% PER THE MOST SINCE OCTOBER 2020 AND THE LOWEST SINCE DECEMBER 2023. AN EXPERIMENT TO BRAIN DRUG FAILED TO PROVIDE POST SURGERY BENEFITS. THE FDA SAID THEY DON'T SEE A PATH FORWARD FOR WIDESPREAD USE BECAUSE IT DID NOT WORK, WHY USE IT? THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DIVERSIFY THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TREATMENT. IT IS THE FIRST NEW TYPE OF PAINKILLER TO REACH THE U.S. MARKETS IN MORE THAN TWO YEARS. THE CAPITAL MARKETS SAID THE SETBACK COULD COST EVERYTHING OF THE RISK PROFILE. > > THAT WHEN TAKING BIG HITS. THE STOCK OVERALL DOWN YEAR TO DATE. LET'S GO TO SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE AFTERMARKET BECAUSE THE RESULT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. HYMNS AT HERS. > > OVER 12%. THEY RECORDED SALES BELOW AVERAGE ESTIMATES. THEY REAFFIRMED THE REVENUE GUIDANCE. THEY SAID IT IS A DIFFICULT QUARTER FOR HIMS. INVESTORS WILL NEED TO BE PATIENT. HIMS HAVE GOTTEN A BOOST FROM SELLING CHEAPER VERSIONS OF POPULAR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS BUT THAT HAS BEEN IMPERILED BECAUSE THE FDA ORDERED MANY COMPANIES TO STOP SELLING COPIES OF NAME BRANDS MADE BY ELI LILLY AND NOVO NORDISK. > > THE TICKER IS HIMS. BUT NOW -- THAT IS BECAUSE THEY USED TO SELL HAIR LOSS DRUGS AND ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION DRUGS. SURELY THERE ARE A LOT MORE HERS THAT ARE CUSTOMERS OF THAT COMPANY THAT THEY SELL THE WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS. > > ARE YOU SAYING WOMEN TAKE WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS? > > I DESPERATELY WANT TO GET SOME, TOO. IT IS ALL OVER MY INSTAGRAM FEED. I'M JUST SAYING THAT MAYBE HALF OF THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE WOMEN. SO THE HIMS TICKER DOESN'T MAKE AS MUCH SENSE. > > MAYBE WE, OR US. > > TAP IS THE TICKER FOR MOLSON COORS, EVEN THOUGH I'M GUESSING MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE -- > > WHEN HE LOSES, HE SWITCHES. > > DRINK OUT OF A BOTTLE OR A CAN. AND FEWER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DRINKING IT IN AMERICA. > > THAT IS RIGHT. SHARES ARE UP 1.5%. THEY SHIP LESS BEER IN AMERICA. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COUNTER AWAY FROM BEER AS MORE PEOPLE TURN TO SPIRITS, CONTEST. > > HE IS ALL NONALCOHOLIC BEER. > > I DON'T DRINK NONALCOHOLIC BEER. I DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL. BUT I DON'T WANT A NONALCOHOLIC BEER. WHY HAVE THE CALORIES IF IT IS NOT GOING TO GET ME BOOZED? I'D RATHER HAVE A CANNABIS COCKTAIL. > > YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL THAT WITH, FIZZY WATER. EVERY TIME I DRINK IT, I'M FOOLING MYSELF BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE ANYTHING, BUT IT IS PAINFUL IN THE THROAT. THEY LOWERED THE GUIDANCE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER, WEAK CONSUMER, SHARES TO ALUMINUM TIRES. LESS PEOPLE ARE DRINKING BEER. > > FEWER PEOPLE. > > MUCH AND MORE. > > MY DAUGHTER JUST CORRECTED ME LAST NIGHT. YOU PEOPLE ARE ANNOYING. > > THERE ARE RULES. THIS IS NOT NAM. > > UP AS MUCH AS 5%, PARING BACK TO A 1.5 PER 6 -- 1.5% GAIN. THANK YOU, WE APPRECIATE IT. FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS, CHECK OUT OUR STOCK MOVERS PODCAST.
