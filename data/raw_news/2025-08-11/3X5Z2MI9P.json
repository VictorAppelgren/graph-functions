  "description": "Rest in pixels.",
  "content": "The internet has always been in flux, a place where sites rise, dominate, and then quietly fade away into oblivion, leaving only traces behind. Yet, for those of us who grew up online, these sites weren\u2019t just web addresses; they were part of our digital lives. Today, many of them exist only in memory, or in the dusty archives of the Wayback Machine.\n\nSome of these sites are not only completely gone, but their domains are now up for grabs on registrars like Namecheap. Others redirect to entirely different websites or bland landing pages. Join me for a trip down memory lane as we revisit some of the most iconic websites of the early internet era.\n\nBefore Google became king, there was AltaVista. Launched in 1995 by Digital Equipment Corporation\u2019s Paul Flaherty, it was one of the first real search engines\u2013a portal that opened up the vast, uncharted web. Thanks to its pioneering web crawler (built by Louis Monier) and indexer (developed by Michael Burrows), AltaVista made the internet feel searchable in a novel way.\n\nAt its peak, AltaVista was a household name. In fact, it was the 11th most visited site in the late \u201990s, and for a while, it looked unbeatable and unstoppable. But then came Google. By the early 2000s, Google\u2019s cleaner interface and superior algorithm left AltaVista in the dust and coughing. Yahoo! would later acquire it in 2003, and a decade later, it was quietly shuttered in 2013, redirecting forever to Yahoo! Search.\n\nStill, if you pull up its 1996 homepage on the Internet Archive, you can almost feel that early-web excitement, the sense that the entire internet was at your fingertips.\n\nWhile AltaVista helped us explore the web, GeoCities let us build our own little corners of it, thanks to founders David Bohnett and John Rezner. Launched in 1994 as Beverly Hills Internet, it was rebranded as GeoCities a year later and became one of the first places where ordinary people could create their own websites, for free.\n\nIts neighborhoods were organized by themes and interests, turning the internet into a sprawling, DIY city named after real cities. For many of us, it was our first real taste of HTML, a place to experiment, customize, and proudly display our personal passions, especially as HTML 2.0 was being standardized at the time.\n\nBy 1999, it was the third most visited site in the world and was eventually acquired by Yahoo! But in 2009, Yahoo! pulled the plug. More than 38 million personal pages vanished overnight, and with them, a chunk of early web culture. These days, a warning page leads to Yahoo!, but the Wayback Machine still holds those quirky, glittery websites, a digital time capsule of the internet\u2019s youth.\n\nIf GeoCities was for building sites on the net, StumbleUpon was for discovering what was already built. Launched in November 2001 by Garrett Camp (who would later found Uber) and his team, including Geoff Smith, Justin LaFrance, and Eric Boyd, it was like spinning a wheel of fortune for the internet. All you needed to do was click a button, and land on a random site perfectly tailored to your interests.\n\nBefore Facebook\u2019s algorithmic newsfeed or TikTok\u2019s For You page brought their magic, StumbleUpon was the go-to place for serendipitous discovery on the web. One minute, you\u2019d be reading a fascinating article about space or science; the next, you\u2019d be watching a bizarre flash animation. It was random. It was addictive. And it was a wonderful time to be alive and online.\n\nBut by 2018, the magic faded. Social media had come into the picture and stolen the limelight. It wasn\u2019t long before Garret and StumbleUpon both announced its shutdown, replaced by a platform called Mix, which sparked mixed reactions from users. Sadly, Mix never quite captured the same spark as StumbleUpon. Still, if you dig into the 2003 version on the Internet Archive, you can almost feel that thrill of stumbling upon something completely new.\n\nAs we moved further into the 2000s, Yahoo! Answers became the go-to place for curiosity. Launched in 2005, it turned the internet into a massive community Q&A forum, where you could literally ask anything and get responses from people all over the world.\n\nFor years, it was a treasure trove of information, advice, and comedy gold. Whether you wanted tips on fixing your computer or just needed to know if penguins were birds, someone out there would answer.\n\nBut as Reddit, Quora, and social media rose, Yahoo! Answers struggled to stay relevant. After 15 years of trying, Yahoo! eventually shut it down in 2021, redirecting the site to Yahoo! Search. Still, peeking at its archived 2005 beta page brings back a flood of memories of late-night question threads and unexpected connections.\n\nIf Yahoo! Answers was about asking questions and getting answers, Megaupload was about sharing and receiving files. Founded in 2005 by Kim Dotcom, this Hong Kong-based service became a giant in file hosting. At its peak, it had over 180 million users and was the 13th most visited site in the world.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just movies and music, people used it to share all kinds of files. But its popularity also brought legal troubles in the form of copyright infringement. In 2012, the FBI swooped in, seized its domains, arrested its owners, and took the entire service offline in a widely publicized takedown.\n\nIn fact, popular hacktivist group, Anonymous, attacked some US government sites in protest. Kim Dotcom later launched Mega, which lives on today as mega.io, but the original Megaupload remains frozen in time on the Wayback Machine\u2014a monument to the wild west days of file sharing.\n\nFinally, as search engines became more automated, ChaCha tried to bring the human touch back to finding answers. Launched in 2006 by Scot A. James and Brad Bostic, it paired users with live guides who helped refine and answer queries in real-time.\n\nIn 2008, it went mobile, letting people text questions to 242-242 for free and receive curated responses, which was a unique innovation back then. At its peak, ChaCha was reportedly handling a million questions a day, making it feel more like chatting with a knowledgeable friend than using a machine.\n\nBut humans can\u2019t outpace algorithms forever. By 2012, its UK operations shut down, and by 2016, the company folded completely due to dwindling revenues. Now, all that remains are its archives, showing a bold experiment in making search personal.\n\nLooking back at these sites, it\u2019s hard not to feel nostalgic. They were more than just tools. They were part of the fabric of our digital lives. Whether it was building a home on GeoCities, falling down the rabbit hole on StumbleUpon, or asking the weirdest questions on Yahoo! Answers, these sites shaped how we explored and experienced the internet.\n\nThanks to web archives, we can still (re)visit these digital relics, frozen snapshots of a younger, wilder web. Isn\u2019t it scary that one day, the apps and sites we use today may also be memories for someone else? Well, that\u2019s the beauty of the internet, it\u2019s all part of the circle of (internet) life.",

      "text": "Most of the popular social media platforms have an FYP or \"For You Page\" that shows you content based on\u2014something? You'll notice that every time you open your social media app of choice it defaults to this feed. The name might be different, but the concept is the same.\nThis may seem harmless, but if you care about having a safe and healthy experience on social media, you might want to avoid the FYP as much as possible.\n5 It\u2019s Not Really \u201cFor You\u201d\nWhile the page may be called \"For You\", it's not actually there for your benefit. Instead, this is the primary place where the algorithm developed by the social media platform can work it magic on you. So while it's very much about you, it's not for you.\nAs the now tired saying goes\u2014if you're not paying, you are the product. The FYP is where maximum value is extracted from you, while you're blissfully unaware that you're being fleeced.\nThe counterpart to the FYP is the \"Following\" page, which shows you the latest posts by people you have chosen to follow. In other words, on the FYP you'll see things you did not ask for. The Following page is curated by you, but, ironically, the FYP is curated by the algorithm on behalf of the platform owner.\n4 It\u2019s a Data Sponge\nEvery interaction you make on a social media platform is observed, stored, and analyzed. However, because the FYP is actively testing you with what it decides to put in your feed, there's a qualitative difference in how that data is used. This is the most unambiguous place you can be experimented on by the software.\nSo the FYP will show you something it thinks will provoke a reaction, and then measure what you're predicted to do versus what you actually do, which then refines what you are shown.\nThis iterative data builds an ever more accurate picture of who you are, how you think, and how you'll behave. A profile that is worth a lot to the various organizations that can make effective use of behavioral data.\n3 It Puts You in an Echo Chamber\nBecause the FYP is curated to engage you, over time it's more likely to simply show you content that it knows you already agree with, or are likely to agree with because of your other related beliefs and views. This means that if you spend all your time on the FYP, you'll rarely see something that contradicts your views, or posts by people on the other side of an issue\u2014unless they want to get a rise out of you!\nThere are obviously drawbacks to this, but in my opinion, the biggest problem is that these sorts of echo chambers can shape your view of what the world is really like. This has been true with traditional media like newspapers and TV news, of course, but the interactive, algorithmic nature of the FYP supercharges the problem.\nYou might overestimate how dangerous the world is, or underestimate how fringe your views are. For example, if you're a member of the Flat Earth community, your FYP may lead you to think that far more people think like you than the true number.\n2 It\u2019s Designed to Make You Feel Bad, Mad, or Sad\nPositive emotions are a good way to get people to stick around your social media platform. If you give them a nice dopamine hit with videos of cute animals, or funny comedians then they'll want keep swiping through that feed. Anyone's FYP will have some of that, but negative emotions can be even more effective as a way to keep eyeballs on advertisements.\nShowing you content tuned to make you angry, make you feel bad about yourself, or make you feel sad about something will also keep people coming back. It doesn't really matter why you stick around or whether you're enjoying yourself, it only matters that you stay and interact.\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but keep in mind that when psychologists hooked up a system where rats could trigger pain or pleasure in their own brain with buttons, they tended to mash both buttons in equal measure\u2014food for thought.\n1 It\u2019s Designed to Be Addictive\nWhether it's brain chemicals related to rewards, danger, or punishment, the FYP wants to get you hooked and it can happen to anyone. This is when you start doomscrolling, or unconsciously reaching for your phone to fill every 30-second gap in your life where you might otherwise have been alone with your thoughts, or simply looked around at the scenery.\nI'd never say that you should avoid social media. You can use it in such a way that you benefit from it more than the people running the system. However, for your own mental health and sense of wellbeing, it's probably best to get into the habit of switching from the FYP (whatever its brand-specific name is) to your own feed whenever you open your social media apps."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSocial media in 2025 is\u2026complicated. It can still be fun and informative, but it takes a lot more effort to get there. There\u2019s engagement bait, tons of ads, and \u201csuggested\u201d content you didn't ask for around every corner. Thankfully, there\u2019s an old internet standard that can cut through the noise.\nWhat Happened to Social Media?\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. In the beginning, social media was a much simpler place. Your feed was just a chronological list of posts from the people and pages you followed. You saw what your friends were up to, in the order they posted it. There was a time when it actually did feel like the \u201cdigital town square\u201d that so many people have talked about.\nThen came the algorithms. Platforms realized this was the trick to keep you scrolling for longer. They started to hide posts from your friends and replace them with content they thought would \"engage\" you more. Your feed stopped being a window into your friends' lives and became a machine designed to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Suddenly, you weren\u2019t seeing what was new\u2014you were seeing what the platform wanted you to see.\nAnother big shift happened when Elon Musk bought Twitter and turned it into X. Many people who were unhappy with the changes and the direction the platform packed their bags and left. The problem was, they didn't all go to the same place. Some went to Threads, some to Bluesky, and others to Mastodon. This exodus fractured communities and many people\u2019s following lists.\nNow, AI is complicating things even further. It's making it even easier for platforms to curate your feed, but it's also being used to create hyper-realistic fake content and misinformation. You have to be more vigilant than ever, trying to figure out what's real and what's just another piece of AI-generated slop. All of this is to say that social media has become a tiring and frustrating experience for many people.\nRemember RSS?\nBack in the distant year of 1999, a little thing called RSS (Really Simple Syndication) arrived on the internet. It was a way to get content from multiple websites in one feed. Sound familiar? Well, RSS didn\u2019t go anywhere. It\u2019s still available on the vast majority of websites. Instead of having a social media algorithm dictate when you see content from your favorite sources, RSS puts you back in control.\nThe idea of RSS is very simple (hence why \u201cSimple\u201d is in the name). You subscribe to a bunch of blogs, news sites, and YouTube channels. Instead of going to each one individually, you open your RSS reader and all the new stuff is right there waiting for you. No algorithms, no ads, just the content you signed up to see.\nUnlike social media sites, which almost all require you to use official apps now, there are tons of RSS reader apps to choose from, and they all work a little differently. Some are simple, like Feedly, and they just show you the new articles. Others, like Inoreader, are more powerful and let you sort, tag, and organize your content. No matter which one you choose, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s a much more peaceful way to consume information.\nSo, how do you get started? Most websites still have an RSS feed. You just have to find the RSS icon or a link that says \"RSS.\" Once you find it, you can copy the URL and paste it into your RSS reader (here's the link for How-To Geek). Some apps, like Feedly, will even let you search for a website and add it automatically. Once you have a few feeds added, you\u2019ll be surprised at how quickly your reader fills up with content. It\u2019s a great way to stay up to date on the stuff you actually care about.\nYou don\u2019t even have to give up social media to switch to RSS. Bluesky and Mastodon support RSS feeds for user profiles, and there are free services that allow you to generate an RSS feed from a social media profile. The cool thing about this is you\u2019ll see the posts in chronological order again. Take that, algorithms!\nWhether you like it or not, there's no denying that social media is very different from what it used to be. There\u2019s more noise and less of what you actually signed up to see. Despite all the mess, it can still be fun and informative if you\u2019re willing to do the work.\nBut if that\u2019s not for you, RSS is a decades-old internet standard that still works on the vast majority of websites. It cuts through the noise and puts you back in control of what you see. RSS is a much more peaceful way to get content from the internet, and it's something you should at least try."

      "text": "Quick Links\nThe internet has more content than one human could experience, yet much is already lost! This is true of movies in particular. Most early films were lost decades ago, but with modern technology, we don't need to lose any more.\nWhat Is the Internet Archive?\nThe Internet Archive is a digital library founded in 1996 by Brewster Kahle. The Internet Archive aims to provide free access to all knowledge by collecting and preserving digital content, including websites, books, software, music, and more.\nThe Internet Archive began as a way to preserve and make accessible the rapidly growing amount of digital content on the internet. It started by using web crawlers to collect and archive websites, creating a digital version of the \"Wayback Machine\" that allows users to see how a website looked at a particular point in time. Over time, the Internet Archive has expanded to include various digital media, including books, music, software, and videos.\nToday, the Internet Archive is a nonprofit organization supported by donations and grants. It continues to collect and preserve digital content and make it available to the public for free.\nThe Internet Archive Hosts Some True Classic Movies\nThe Internet Archive has a vast collection of movies, including many classic, independent, and foreign films. Some of the most interesting and notable movies preserved on the Internet Archive include:\n- The General (1926): A silent comedy film directed by and starring Buster Keaton.\n- Metropolis (1927): A German expressionist science fiction film directed by Fritz Lang.\n- Nosferatu (1922): A German Expressionist horror film directed by F. W. Murnau.\n- The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920): A German Expressionist horror film directed by Robert Wiene.\n- The Red Balloon (1956): A French fantasy film directed by Albert Lamorisse.\n- Battleship Potemkin (1925): A silent film directed by Sergei Eisenstein.\n- The Night of the Living Dead (1968): A horror film directed by George A. Romero.\n- The Mummy (1932): A horror film directed by Karl Freund.\nThese are just a few examples of the many fascinating and important movies preserved on the Internet Archive. If you are a movie buff, you can explore the Internet Archive's collection to discover more hidden gems and classic films. Not to mention lost episodes of TV shows, or TV pilots that never made it to screen!\nThe Archive Goes Way Beyond Movies\nAs mentioned above, in addition to movies, the Internet Archive has a vast collection of other types of digital content. Some of the other types of content available on the Internet Archive include:\n- Books: The Internet Archive has a collection of over 36 million books.\n- Music: The Internet Archive has a collection of over two million recordings of music, including recordings of live concerts, radio broadcasts, and other audio content.\n- Software: The Internet Archive has a collection of over 950,000 software programs and games, including many classic and historical examples.\n- Television: The Internet Archive has a collection of over three million television programs, including episodes of classic TV shows, news programs, and more.\n- Websites: The Internet Archive has a collection of over 780 billion web pages, including many historical versions of websites.\n- Audio recordings: The Internet Archive has a collection of over 15 million audio recordings, including lectures, interviews, and other audio content.\n- Images: The Internet Archive has a collection of over 4.5 million images, including photographs, illustrations, and other visual media.\nHow Is the Internet Archive Legal?\nThe Internet Archive is essentially an online public library operating within the bounds of copyright law and works with rights holders to ensure that the content it collects and preserves is made available legally. In many cases, the content on the Internet Archive is in the public domain or is licensed under Creative Commons or other open licenses that allow for free distribution and use.\nOf course, intellectual property laws vary from one country to another. Something that's in the public domain in one nation may not be in yours. However, everything on the archive is legal within the legal jurisdiction from which it operates.\nThat doesn't mean the site isn't involved with litigation from time to time. For example, there are copyright holders who have made legal challenges to the Internet Archive's \"lending library\" practices with regard to ebooks. In general, this isn't something that you need to worry about as a site visitor.\nThere's Even More Movie Magic Out There\nThe Internet Archive is certainly one of the largest repositories of media on the internet and a crucial project to preserve movies, TV shows, and many other media that would otherwise disappear. It's a worthy cause, but if you love exploring the history of movies, especially more recent ones, there are many other hidden gem sites on the web.\nThe Internet Archive isn't the only library service on the web offering movies. If you have a library card from a participating library, you can stream movies without ads for free on services such as Hoopla and Kanopy.\nGenre film fans, in particular, can access plenty of free content in popular genres such as action films, horror films, or something a little more festive. So if you're scrolling through Netflix and can't choose anything maybe consider diving into the archives."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSince the beginning of the internet, HTML has been crucial to making the world wide web work and appear the way we want it to. Let's take a look at what HTML is and how it turns into the pages you see every day.\nThe Backbone of the Internet\nHTML stands for \"hypertext markup language.\" It's a coding language used to create pages that a web browser can display. Most of the web pages you find on the internet, including the one you're reading this article on right now, are stored as an HTML file. Websites are a bunch of related HTML pages stored on a server somewhere. That's why the language is frequently called the \"backbone of the internet.\"\nWhenever you go to a page on the internet, you're essentially requesting an HTML file stored on the server. Then, the browser you're using, such as Chrome or Firefox, will parse the HTML and display it to you in the way that it's intended.\nHTML's universality and versatility make it the single most popular markup language in the world. Most front-end web developers start by learning how to code in HTML. The drag-and-drop tools and WYSIWYG editors are eventually translated into HTML so that browsers can parse them.\nHow HTML Works\nLike any programming language, HTML looks like a bunch of commands and text blocks before it's turned into the front-facing visual. If you're curious to see what the HTML on this particular page looks like and you're on a desktop or laptop, try right-clicking anywhere on this page and select \"View Page Source\" (the option may vary depending on your browser). It should take you to a giant wall of code.\nMost HTML is built using \"element blocks,\" which are snippets of HTML code that separate different elements on a page. For example, this article's body is an element block, as is the menu, the recommendations below, and the page's footer. These elements are coded in their own way, as they may behave differently.\nA crucial part of building out HTML pages is the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). These are documents that define what particular elements of a page should look like. For example, how big images should be, what fonts should appear on a page, and how a web page should respond when it's resized or stretched. These are all crucial to creating attractive, cohesive, and stylish websites. If you've noticed websites starting to look better in the last decade, the increasing use of CSS is the biggest reason. You can read more about CSS here.\nOne of the best things about HTML is its ability to run dynamic scripts via JavaScript or JS. These scripts can create dynamic elements. For example, on certain websites, hovering on an image will allow you to zoom into it. You can make this effect by coding in a JavaScript element.\nHTML Basics\nWhile HTML is a fairly complex language with tons of different tags and blocks, there are a few HTML codes that might come in handy as you're browsing the web. Here are a couple of basic HTML tags that you might encounter.\n<a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com\">How-to Geek</a>\nYou use the <a>\ncommand to create a link. The URL is where the link will point to, and the text that reads \"How-to Geek\" is how it will appear to an end-user.\n<b>bold</b> <i>italic</i> <u>underline</u>\nbold italic underline\nYou can use the <b>\n, <i>\n, and <u>\nto apply the standard text formatting options: bold, italics, and underlined text.\n<img src=\"picture.jpg\">\nThe <img>\ntag is used to embed an image into a page. It will either pull the image from the same domain, or you can point it to an external domain. You can also customize it with some additional attributes, such as resizing and alt text.\n<h1>heading 1</h1> <p>paragraph</p>\nThe above are heading and paragraph tags. Similar to how Microsoft Word allows you to sort the text into headers and body text, HTML can also format text based on default header and paragraph options.
