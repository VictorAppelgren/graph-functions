      "feedback": "The draft is directionally solid (three-regime framing, cross‑topic focus, and use of five IDs) but the reasoning is under‑defined, the numbers are imperfectly integrated, and the write‑up risks ambiguity about causality and triggers; fix by rebuilding into a crisp, first‑principles transmission map with explicit cause–effect links from regime state to policy, to flows and ROIC, to equity pricing, and then to a concise watch‑list. Actionable edits: 1) Reframe to a single, explicit causal chain: Regime A/B/C drive discount rates, risk premia, and currency dynamics; those feed sectoral ROIC re‑rating and capital allocation toward domestic semis/AI infra, which in turn paths into equity prices; anchor each link to a cited source ID (NL5YYTLF2, SGB2PAZGK, J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX, 22PL3Q360). 2) Lock the probabilities and tie them to sources: keep the three-probability map (Base 45–55%, Tariff-escalation 20–30%, AI/EV-led 25–35%) and explicitly map them to observable regime signals (inflation persistence, wage growth, Jackson Hole guidance, semiconductor capex cadence); avoid hedging language and show how shifts in these bands would alter the transmission. 3) Fix and complete numbers from sources: correct the truncated “gross margin ≈ 4” to “gross margin ≈ 4%” (and fully state ACMR long-horizon anchor: 2025 revenue midpoint ≈ $900m, gross margin ≈ 4%); ensure all Ford/22PL3Q360 metrics (Q2 EV losses ≈ $1.3B, adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%, ROIC ≈ 10.1%) are clearly tied to the mechanism (EV pricing, unit economics, ROIC retention). 4) Sharpen the oil narrative as regime inputs, not background: present Regime A oil path (Brent mid‑60s, WTI low‑60s, runs near highs) vs Regime B (demand relief or weakness) with explicit link to macro regime and to how oil prints feed inflation persistence and policy responses. 5) Strengthen medium‑term catalysts with concrete triggers and invalidation: Jackson Hole guidance, semiconductor capex cadence, tariff developments, and AI/EV investment‑flow data as checks; invalidate with a reversal signal (e.g., wage growth slows meaningfully and inflation persists below target, or a hawkish Jackson Hole surprise pushes rates higher). 6) Build a tight watch‑list (4–5 signals) and assign time horizons (e.g., next 4–8 weeks for capex prints, next FOMC/Jackson Hole window for guidance, and oil‑balance prints for the quarter); include explicit post‑event read‑throughs for ROIC and capex reallocation. 7) Tighten citation discipline and reconciliation: attach each factual claim to one ID, ensure all critical items (macro, policy, flows, valuation) are drawn from NL5YYTLF2, SGB2PAZGK, J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX, 22PL3Q360, and reconcile any conflicting signals (e.g., oil path vs inflation path) within the regime framework rather than presenting parallel, unlinked strands. 8) Improve clarity and format to fit the horizon/style constraint: present as a compact, page‑one synthesis with a short executive thesis, a one‑paragraph regime map, a two‑column watch‑list, and a one‑line risk matrix, ensuring every claim maps to the cited IDs and avoiding stray or incomplete phrases.",
