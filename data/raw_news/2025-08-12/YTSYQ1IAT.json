  "content": "Live from Washington, D.C. This is balance of power with Joe Matthew. Donald Trump prepares for the most important meeting of his presidency. Welcome to the Monday edition. On the early side here on balance of power, as we look to Friday's summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, we'll talk about the stakes and chances for peace with Brett Bruen from the Global situation Room coming up in just a moment. Chipmakers in vedere and AMD will pay the administration to sell air chips in China. We're going to talk about the crypto pro today with Jennifer Welch at Bloomberg Economics. And as President Trump deploys National Guard troops to the streets of D.C.. We'll talk about his public safety emergency and what it means for the capital city. With our panel, Bloomberg Politics contributors Rick Davis and Jeannie Shann Zaino are with us for the hour. And it's all after a look at Wall Street. We get to Charlie Pellet and the markets right now from world headquarters in New York. TRUMP And good day, Joe.

Wherever you get your podcasts and back, we go to Washington. Balance of power continues. Once again, your hosts, Joe, Matthew and I. Charlie, many thanks. We'll get back to Charlie Pellet a little bit from now to check on the Monday trade as we keep our eyes on India and AMD. As soon as I saw this headline this morning, I started wondering what the stock reaction would be. And remarkably, there hasn't been much reaction because this is unprecedented what's coming from the White House today. The president a short time ago confirming this news that NVIDIA and AMD have agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from Chinese chip sales to the U.S. government. The U.S. government is getting in the CHIP business, apparently, and these are the A.I. chips that at one time were being held from China, not allowed in the market. The H-20, for instance, as export controls were turned up in the name of national security. We've come a long way from that moment. President Trump, in an unrelated news conference, was asked about it earlier today. Listen. I deal with Jensen, who is a great guy, and Nvidia, the chip that we're talking about, the H-20. It's it's an old chip. China already has it in a different form, different name, but they have it or they have a combination of two will make up for it and even then some. Blackwell is super duper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that, although it's possible I'd make a deal a somewhat. Enhanced in a negative way. BLACKWELL In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it. But that's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years. But the age 20 is obsolete. You know, it's one of those things, but it still has a market. The comments about Blackwell remarkable in their own right as we bring in Jennifer Welsh, Bloomberg economics chief geo economist. Jenny, it's great to see you. Thank you so much. I can't imagine what you're thinking about this. We'll get to Blackwell. Let's start with the h-20 and what we know. I'm hearing things like quid pro quo, unprecedented. Both of those are true, right? These are companies that are essentially paying for access. Pay to play is the new rule. Yeah, in two ways. Pay to play in the sense of, you know, getting the White House to agree to essentially allow themselves chips of China in in the sense of getting them access to the Chinese market. As you noted, it was only actually a few months ago that we decided to not allow the H-20 chips to be sold to China. As President Trump noted, they are not as powerful as the cutting edge chips, but they're still pretty powerful. And that was the reason behind initially banning the export of them just weeks ago. By the way. Yes. Talking about not that long ago. Exactly. Now, this scheme seems unable to allow the U.S. government to reap a lot of revenue, allow in video and aimed to offset revenue from selling to the Chinese market and China to gain from having access to these still pretty powerful chips. The idea of he's talking about Blackwell, which is the the newest and best that India has, and there's quite a backlog to get them. It just gives you the sense that he's willing to make a deal on just about anything. First, he said he needs a price tag. Well, that's right. So is is that the case here? And, Jenny, to the extent that this is legal, do we know is this constitutional? So on the first question, it does seem like it's sort of a commoditized thing. Export controls or national security policies. And we saw that earlier this year, in fact, where the Trump administration put in place some export controls that were explicitly about building leverage in talks with China. And then they immediately rolled them off once they got to an agreement in London with the Chinese on a two trade truce in order to get the rare earth to flow back in. Right. So we have seen this before from this team. On the second question of legality, that's an interesting one, because this very much looks like an export tax, which isn't constitutional, but it's also technically, it seems, a voluntary agreement by these companies. So maybe that's the illegality on which it stands. I think the question that I would be asking, you know, if I was an executive for a firm that produces things that are expert controlled, is will I be next? Right. Absolutely. Do we know where the money goes, by the way, and what it would be used for? No special India account somewhere in the White House? Unclear. Yes. Unclear. Unclear where the money goes. Unclear where the line is. I'm guessing then, because it seems to me if 15% gets you to sell each tows in China, would 50% be enough to sell Blackwell's in Beijing. Right. And it wasn't clear when President Trump was talking that press conference. Some of it might have been about the capacity of the ship itself, how powerful it is. Yeah. But is yeah, is there going to be a fee for power sort of ratio applied there? They said they'd turn it down 30% or something like that. I don't know. Tomorrow's supposed to be a big deadline with China. This was the trade truce that was to be expiring tomorrow, but there's talk of it being extended. What's your expectation? I think it looks very likely it's going to be extended. Certainly the chief negotiators for that deal, Secretary Lot, Nick, Secretary Bassett, have indicated they expect that President Trump will approve an extension. Maybe he's just trying to make the Chinese sweat a little bit by holding out to the last moment. But all signs seem to point to he doesn't want an escalation of that trade war. He wants some sort of deal. You know, he was talking about soybeans earlier. We've seen that there's been probably some ongoing conversations about U.S. export controls. So I think all signs are pointing positive. But as with everything President Trump, you never know until he says the last word on it. Well, that's for sure. What should we be looking for, though, in the next couple of days when it comes to China, specifically because we were said this was the big one, it would take months, if not years, to actually get to a real trade deal with China. But we've been seeing these framework arrangements that maybe something emerges in the next week or so. What stage are we at in this game? My expectation is a little bit more calibrated that I think they're probably going to extend the truce to give themselves more time to negotiate and work toward some sort of deal that perhaps the leaders, if they do meet later this fall, can announce that might involve something like purchase agreements, export control rules, maybe something from China on fentanyl as well. But I think more along those lines probably is still going to take some time to get there. Really interesting. Jenny, thank you so much. Jennifer Welch, Bloomberg economics chief, geo economist. This is why we have Jenny Handy trying to figure out exactly what's going on. It's not always that easy when it comes to the confusion around tariffs, in this case, a potential export tax. We're watching shares of both in video and AMD and they're moving higher. We thought this might weigh on the shares this morning when the headline first broke in video. Right now up about 3/10 of a percent, almost a dollar. AMD is doing pretty well. It's up one and a half percent, up more than $2 a share. You can read a lot more about this on the terminal. It is one of the biggest stories of the day and video AMD to pay 15% of China chip sales. The other big one, of course, brings us to the end of the week, and that would be Friday. We now know that the meeting will take place in Alaska. We don't have a lot of other details at this point. President will be wheels up to Alaska Friday and at some point during the day, we don't have a time either. He will be in a room with Vladimir Putin talking about presumably the end of the war in Ukraine. The president did get into this earlier at his news conference in the briefing room. Let's listen. You know, I'm going to see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capitol was with graffiti all over the walls. It's another partisan, by the way, because we're talking about safety. We're also talking about beautification. Beautification indeed he has been talking about today. Brett Bruin has spent a career as a diplomat and now a consultant in this field. The president of the Global Situation Room, former White House global engagement director with us in studio here and the mean streets of washington. Bret, great to see you. Yeah survives the trip over got out of here from the mean streets of old town to the dystopian center of washington here. Congratulations. I've got a lot of questions for you and I suspect you've got some questions that need to be answered as well. This was initially framed as a win for Putin just to get in a room with Donald Trump. Now we're the host nation. How is this going to unfold on Friday in Alaska? Well, let's start with that, because normally in diplomacy, you would hold that back a trip to the United States. We all remember when Trump raised the prospect in his first term of the Taliban coming to Camp David. And there were a lot of us sitting around. Maybe the reason they didn't come was that's just so strategically stupid. Yeah. And now we're inviting the leader of a country that's invaded, an ally not to sign an agreement, not because he's made major, major concessions just to feel each other out, according to the president earlier today. That's not the sort of thing that you do in sequential order. You start with the substance and then you get to the superficial stuff. Right. They should, I guess, in the traditional sense, be showing up with an agreement already in hand. Right. We're coming here to codify this agreement. Will there be other people in the room? Will this go on for hours? What do you expect? Well, we know from past meetings, even past telephone calls, Trump likes to go mano a mano with Putin, maybe a Russian translator in there, which means there are no American eyes or ears on that conversation. Concerning. Yes, who will be in the room? Probably Marco Rubio, not least of which because he holds like 11 different cabinet positions at the moment. Yes. But also on top of that, look, the question of Vladimir Zelensky. We are talking about Ukraine, and yet Ukraine still has a question mark. You know, and it's interesting, J.D. Vance yesterday saying, well, we'll kind of see and work that out. No, that's something you work out before you extend the invitation to Putin and the price of Putin getting to come to the U.S. He is sitting at a table with Vladimir Zielinski. And the notion that they haven't worked these things out ahead of time is just really perplexing. He just said this morning that the next meeting would likely between be between Putin and Zelensky, as he saw it, or all three of them, because he'd be glad to show up and help to mediate this. He's approaching this as the man who wants the Nobel Peace Prize. Does that bring its own liability? Well, let me disabuse those around this town who are floating the idea that the Nobel Committee, a committee of Swedes, Norwegians who believe firmly in things like anti-colonialism, are going to give a guy who's threatening to colonize not one, not two, but multiple countries the peace prize. Because when we talk about peace, we're not just talking about, you know, this kind of superficial social post that Trump puts out there and claims that it's a peace deal. We're talking about real substantive peace deals. And Joe, you and I have had conversations about this. But, you know, when we're involved in peace deals, there are chapters, there are whole volumes that are involved of, you know, borders as well as how exchanges of troops and and the whole confidence building measure. None of that is here with any of these deals. Well, in the meantime, Vladimir Zelensky is sitting in his office reading stories about freezing lines in place that we're going to hand over the Donbas and Crimea. And the president referred to these so-called land swaps. He was asked about this earlier today. Bret, let's listen to what he said. The next meeting will be with Zelensky and Putin. For Zelensky and Putin, to me, I'll be there if they need. But I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders. I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, well, I have to get constitutional approval. I mean, he's got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap because there'll be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody to the good for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff, Also some bad stuff for both. Some bad stuff. Land swapping. Are we talking about Donbas in Crimea in exchange for sharp erasure or something very lopsided? What does he mean by swapping? Just to be clear, it is 2025. It is not 1825. Yeah. The president of the United States does not get to swap territories of other countries. That is why we had the Peace of Westphalia of 1638. It is critically important that Trump understand what he can and what he cannot negotiate away. And at the end of the day, not only Ukraine, but our European allies are not going to accept that Trump is rewarding somebody who invaded another country, that he is deciding what the borders of Ukraine will be. Ultimately, yes, it is up to the Ukrainian constitution. More importantly, it's up to the Ukrainian people to make that determination. Well, so far from the idea of rewarding Russia for its behavior, and that does seem to be the essence of the agreement that we have been talking about, at least in the past couple of days. By the way, there is an alternate European plan that we can get into as well, that I'm not sure the president has a lot of interest in. But look, I'm going to ask you this and you might not want to answer it. A lot of the analysis recently has referred to Munich that the president is walking into the next Munich. Is that where your head is? I think it's worse in some it's worse. Yes, because in the sense that we face back in the run up to World War Two with Adolf Hitler, with the threat that he posed a clear and present danger. But what Putin does is actually, in many ways more nefarious, because he is yes, in some cases like in Ukraine, directly attacking a sovereign country, but in others he's undermining from inside. And that includes in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe and here in the United States. That, again, is why it is so strange that you would invite Vladimir Putin to American territory while he is still actively working to undermine our institutions, our ideals, the borders of the United States. I mean, he I think it was somewhat of a Freudian slip today when Trump suggested he was going to Russia. I certainly hope that Alaskan territory American territory is not in the cards with these land swaps. But, you know, there was a time, I do have to say, at least in the Munich Agreement, there was a European and American consensus about the rights of certain countries, about international law. There is not currently. And that's what makes this moment, Joe, so dangerous. European plan rejecting this Russian proposal here to to keep the eastern Donbas. There was a big meeting over the weekend calling for a diplomatic end here and protect Ukraine's interests. Does Donald Trump care what our European allies think? He suggested he'd give them a call and let him know what happened after this meeting. So here's the funny thing. TRUMP Now, you know, a good 200 days into his term is starting to realize, yes, you can bluster, you can bulldoze over our allies, but then it comes back to bite you in the rear end because they are not going to cooperate in other ways. And yes, he can certainly with Ursula von der Leyen and the European Union try to impose his 15% tariffs, one way tariffs on the EU. But they, in this notion of reciprocity in international relations, are able to find ways to be less cooperative on fronts that we need them. Fascinating. I love to talk to you. Once this meeting takes place, this is why we bring in Brett Brewin. Fascinating conversation. We always learn something from Brett at the Global Situation Room. Many thanks for the insights. We're going to assemble our political panel next. Rick Davis and JD Shan Zeno will join us as the president deploys National Guard troops to the streets of D.C.. It's straight ahead only here on Bloomberg. One of those days where we have a bit of a three ring circus, multiple lead stories that we're juggling here on balance of power. It's just another Monday in August the 11th, in fact. And thank you for joining us on the Monday edition here on Bloomberg TV and Radio. As you heard a short time ago in Virginia and AMD, we've talked about it with Jennifer Welch paying 15% of China air chip sales. A massive story coming out of Washington today that has our eyes on shares of both of those companies. We've got the Trump and Putin meeting on Friday, as we just talked about with Brett Bruen. And then we've got what's happening here in our capital city. This locally is the biggest story of the day, I would suggest. And if you're with us on 99.1, we see you. We live here too. The president, of course, referring to crime and homelessness in Washington, D.C., promising a news conference this morning. And he did hold that news conference. Quite remarkable, as we saw in Los Angeles. The. President is going to be deploying National Guard troops to the streets of D.C., invoking a public safety emergency, about 800 troops. Based on what we're hearing so far, but also deploying federal law enforcement from about a dozen agencies across town. The president spoke to reporters about it a short time ago. Listen. Told them whatever happens, you know, they love to spit in the face of the police. As the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face. And I said, You tell them you spit, and we hit and they can hit real hard. You spit. We hit. The president saying, as he was flanked by his attorney general and secretary of defense, it's not just the National Guard troops. The president of the United States is also federalizing the local police department, the D.C. Metro police, and under our Home Rule act, that is in fact, allowed, although only for increments of 48 hours. So it's unclear exactly how that would run. And one of our biggest questions right now is what does the mayor think of this? We sat down just a few weeks ago this summer with Muriel Bowser to talk about her relationship with this administration, working with Donald Trump. Here's a bit of what she said. President Trump left D.C. during COVID. Which cities were ravaged by COVID? Absolutely. Homelessness, too, increases in crime too, with lack of services because government agencies were shuttered. And we've worked very hard to get that image out of his mind because that's not the DC of today. In fact, we've driven down crime to a 30 year low. Our tourism recovered in 2020 for our kids were the fastest back to school and our school population has rebounded and investment in D.C.. People are looking hard at us because of some of the changes we're making in our business environment. We are lowering taxes, we are cutting red tape and we are incentivizing good businesses to start here, grow here, and hire D.C. residents. Do you feel like you have a partner in the White House or an obstacle? Well, it's a partnership we work on every day. Certainly, the president has an outsized influence over the city of Washington because it's the nation's capital. So we'd like him to make some bigger investments like Union Station and continuing to be a partner and developing RFK, helping us retool and reskill our workers and asking him to pause on these separations and rehire qualified people. I. That partnership that Mayor Bowser talked about is being tested severely right now. As we assemble our political panel, Bloomberg Politics contributors Jenny Shannon Zaino and Rick Davis are with us right now. Jeannie is senior democracy fellow with the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. Rick is a Republican strategist and partner at Stone Cort Capital. Rick, I'm going to start with you because with some exceptions, you spent the bulk of your life living here in the mid-Atlantic area, in the Washington, D.C. region. You know this city about as well as anybody that I know. Is this required? Is this necessary now and is it legal? You know, so much of what Donald Trump does is not just for impact, but for symbolism. And I got to believe, based on what we've heard today, that this is a very symbolic gesture. It's a gesture to try and really, you know, re federalize and store the influence of the federal government in Washington, D.C. You know, we used to have things many people don't remember, but the streets of Washington have been cleaned up a lot over the last few decades. And a lot of that came through federal money, through federal participation, Pennsylvania Avenue Development Commission, things like that. I mean, there were places that are thriving today that were war zones when I was growing up. And that process, that progress, a lot of times was done through symbolic gestures. We don't know where this last, as you pointed out. Right now, the federalization of the police is a short term thing. When Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops in L.A., like what he's now doing in Washington, D.C., it was for a minimum amount of time. They're now back at home with their families in L.A.. So it's it's it's a kind of wait and see thing. I mean, the one thing Donald Trump does is he makes these grand gestures, but he doesn't fill you in on sort of what he hopes to accomplish in the process of doing that. It's really something. I came to Washington as a resident, at least in the 1990s. There was still evidence on the you street corridor of burned out buildings that had been left there since the Martin Luther King riots in 1968, Chinatown, or what we now call Gallery Place or whatever that is, was much the same huge investments were made here in Washington Post. Marion Barry to the point where it's unrecognizable, as Rick just said, in some areas, if you go to the neighborhood known as Noma and you were somewhere else the last ten years, you wouldn't even know what city you were in. So I think we have to acknowledge the progress that's been made here over the course of decades. But most recently, we know that a lot of cities were in pretty bad shape coming out of COVID. And most of the data I heard today from President Trump was two years old back to 2023, as the city emerged from COVID, there was a rash of violence in Washington. We lived through it and we talked about it at the time. Carjackings specifically were through the roof. But we've also seen some pretty steep declines since then. And Jeannie, I'm looking at a memo right now that came from the Justice Department. It was Joe Biden's Justice Department, but it's dated the 3rd of January, Friday, 2025. The headline is Violent Crime in DC Hits 30 year low three zero, down 35% from 2023, lowest in 30 years. How come the president didn't mention these statistics? Yeah. And it's not just coming out of the Biden administration. One of the most bizarre aspects of this press conference, he just did what his own FBI director, Kash Patel, stood up. Apparently, nobody looked at his talking points because what did he say? The murder rate is plummeting. It's the lowest in history. And yet we have an emergency requiring the president to federalize D.C.. And those two things just don't comport. And, of course, the data that you're talking about, all the data we've looked at don't comport. And so this is another example in a long line of what Donald Trump has been doing since he came back to office, which has been declaring emergencies that the data doesn't support in order to expand his executive power. We talk about it all the time in the context of tariffs. He is doing that tariff regime under this declaration of an emergency that the courts are looking to see if actually exists. And this will certainly go to the courts and people will be able to vet whether these numbers add up. But what is most concerning here is not just about DC, but about President Trump talking about the fact that this may spread to other cities, this may spread to Illinois, to Chicago, this may spread to New York City. In New York, I mentioned it's already been in L.A. So that is most concerning. And I think the question that comes to my mind is why is this at the top of the president's agenda today, on August 11th, with as much going on in our country and the world as is going on, is he creating an emergency where the data suggests that none exists? And I think we can think about answers to that question. But one comes to mind when a reporter asked about the Epstein Files, the press conference ended abruptly, and that was that, you know, you're not the first person to use that name today, as people say, Why now and why not in the first term, for instance, when crime in fact was higher based on the stats that we're seeing? Rick, from a political standpoint, when you consider the electorate watching this locally here in Washington and all over the country, based on what we saw in California following the tariff stuff that Jenny mentioned, does the voter begin to fatigue when it comes to emergencies? How many emergencies can America take? Yeah, I wonder if anybody really even focuses on that. I mean, we obviously are, you know, policy nerds. We get in the weeds on authorities that the president and the Congress has to exercise their various powers. And and yet what the public sees is today Donald Trump deployed federal troops ended in the DC and and and I don't think people really are going to second guess him on what powers he has to do that he's very good at trying to blow through those kinds of questions. He never actually addresses his authorities. He assumes those authorizations and and and focuses instead on the the real act that's that's going on. And I do think this has actually less to do with the the the the Jeffries controversy and a lot more to do with just the politics of Donald Trump like Donald Trump's and talking about city blight. You know, for four decades he used to rail about it in New York, Israel about it here and everywhere else he's been. And the reality is part of that is to put himself politically on the side of the cops versus the politicians. And I think the Democrats have to look at this from a point of view that says, you know what, this is a vulnerability for us. We have to be careful because if Donald Trump is successful, these kind of safety issues, especially in big urban environments, and you see Donald Trump throwing L.A. in Chicago and New York all under the bus, he's going to use this politically. And I think less worry about controversies and more worry about politics. Rick Davis and Jeannie Shann Zaino, many thanks to both of you for the insights. Our Bloomberg Politics contributors with great analysis today. President Trump just now on truth. Social gold will not be. We'll have more on this straight ahead. On balance of power on Bloomberg TV and radio, this is balance of power. The Monday edition on bloomberg TV and radio. Glad you joined us. I'm Joe Matthew in Washington where we're talking in Virginia and AMD once again today because of very important news from the White House. Maybe we should have known something was cooking when we heard that the export controls on the H20 chips from and video specifically had been cranked back. But the sales had not begun. Couple of weeks went by and licenses still had not been granted to India to sell the tows in China. Then there was a deal. Fast forward to today. The licenses are going out and both in Vedere and AMD are both now agreeing to pay 15% of the money they take in from selling A.I. chips in China to the U.S. government. The administration is in the chip business according to this plan, and we have a lot of questions about exactly how this will work, where the money will go. The president was asked about it during his news conference this morning at the White House, specifically referring to Jensen Huang at in video. Listen. I deal with Jensen, who is a great guy and Nvidia, the chip that we're talking about, the H-20. It's it's an old chip. China already has it in a different form, different name, but they have it or they have a combination of two will make up for it and even then some. The black well is super duper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that, although it's possible I'd make a deal a somewhat. Enhanced in a negative way. BLACKWELL In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it. But that's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years, But the age 20 is obsolete. You know, it's one of those things, but it still has a market as a big market as in video, it would be expected to make billions. The White House maybe will, too, by scooping 15% from those sales. What the president said about Blackwell is very significant. By the way, nobody ever thought Blackwell was on the table here, but as he suggests and enhanced in a negative way, Blackwell suggesting that it would be not enhanced and in fact, a lower power, lower achieving ship. Maybe there's a deal to be made there. I've never heard that floated, and this will be a fascinating thing to witness. He says they won't have it for five years. Maybe they will sooner than later here, knowing that a month went by after the export controls were loosened. A month went by before this deal was struck and two days later, the licenses were granted. We want to talk about this with Anna Ashton, The founder of Ashton Analytics, is with a specialist in US-China trade. As you've heard many times here on this program, economics, former China analyst with the Department of Defense. And it's great to see you. Welcome back to Bloomberg TV and Radio. There were questions about the legality of this move. Is it, in fact, unprecedented? It certainly is unprecedented, Joe. We've never seen the U.S. government prior to this. Grant export controls in exchange for a percentage of the revenue. So, yes, it is unprecedented. Do you think it's constitutionally allowed? Is this legal? I don't know. I don't know if it's legal. I think that we're for a moment where the president feels fairly confident that he can bend the rules. I mean, if you look at the situation with with tick tock, there's a law saying that tick tock shouldn't be operating in the United States now. But it's been that the implementation of that has been extended a couple of times and no one's even really talking about it anymore, despite the fact that there has been no sale. So I think, you know, Trump is probably I'm pretty pretty firm ground and assuming that he can get away with this, regardless of what, you know, the exact law actually is, and that Congress will back him up, at least this Congress. He is definitely facing criticism from national security books. And there are plenty of people in Congress who have historically taken more of the national security line about issues like this. So I'm sure that we will hear a response to this from members of Congress that expresses concern. But, you know, there's a difference between expressing concern and actually doing anything about it. Let's know what the China Select Committee thinks about this. We're going to be talking with Raja Krishnamoorthi on the Late Edition. The Balance of Power. And so we will go there and an analysis from Jenni Welch at Bloomberg Economics. She's our geoeconomics. Analysts suggest that this quid pro quo agreement is in fact a targeted export tax, which the Constitution outlaws. So I'll be deeply curious to see if this holds up in court, if it's challenged. But there's a greater question about where the line is here. Could Jensen Huang simply pay up more and start selling Blackwell's tomorrow in China as well? It sounds like what Trump was suggesting, Joe, is that any sales of Blackwell's would have to involve, you know, modifying them so that they are not as cutting edge as they are now, which is essentially what the HUO chips are. They're modified to be less thing cutting edge. Mm hmm. You know, maybe I'll take that example off the table, then. I think that the question is, could Jensen Huang sell anything he wants? As long as the price is high enough. We've cracked the door on this. We've set the precedent. And how far could it go? You know, I think I think it depends on whether the primary motivation here from the White House is finding ways to raise revenue with trade relationships, or whether the primary motivation in this particular instance is reaching an agreement with their Chinese counterparts. And I think it's probably it's a combination of that. Obviously, this administration is determined to get more for the U.S. economy out of trade relationships, you know, in their mind, get more or the U.S. economy out of trade relationships. And in that respect, this is consistent with sort of the broader trade policy of raising tariffs because tariffs represent revenue. But on the other hand, you know, we've got these ongoing negotiations with Chinese counterparts that seem to have been motivated strongly by China's rare earths and magnets export licensing regime, which was implemented in April. And although although the initial talks did result in a big upswing in China's exports of rare earths and magnets in June, the July numbers are down considerably from the June numbers. And that continues to be an issue that seems to be causing the White House quite a bit of stress. So this also could be part of a deal specifically with Beijing to try to ensure that the United States continues to receive adequate amounts of rare earths and magnets. Sure. Understood. So we've got this deadline tomorrow on the trade truce, assuming this is all connected somehow. Are you just waiting for the announcement on tomorrow's deadline to be extended? You know, I think we all all of us who are concerned with the trade relationship hope that there will be an extension because the possibility of a snapback of 245% tariffs on Chinese imports is. It's one that is sort of stomach churning for an awful lot of businesses and ultimately would definitely be passed down to some extent to U.S. consumers that would raise prices. I think both sides want to extend the tariff deadline. But the question is, can they reach mutually amenable terms? And that is clearly coming down to the wire. Sure is. The current truce expires 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. So we have the rest of today and tomorrow to figure this out. If they do not extend that truce, extend that deadline, tariffs would jump above 50%. And a great to see you, Anna Ashton, thank you as always. Ashton Analytics with their eyes on China. We'll have more news on China this week as we turn to gold. The president continuing to flood the zone. In his second hundred days. Well, I guess we're beyond that now. We're in we're at 205 or something today. GOLD Yes, indeed. The president on truth, social gold will not be tariff, he says, exclamation point. That's the whole post. Remembering the back and forth next week that sent gold to the moon and then a whole round trip back to where we started. Following reports that imported gold bars would be tariffs. Mike McGlone joined us. He's back now with the update here, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence enjoying the sweet air of the Midwest this week. Mike, it's great to have you with us. Is this what we had already priced in on Friday, just making it officially a joke? Joe, you now with your introduction of it, I'm actually in Indiana today in the heartland. And the key thing about gold is it just absolutely loved Mr. Trump, the gold market. And you saw this one of those other nuances, the potential for the tariffs, which was kind of silly, but now we're saying it's not going to happen in gold. The bottom line for gold is the nuances of Mr. Trump are nothing but good. And, for example, is pushing back in the data from us at blacks, which means, okay, our data is now somewhat potentially going to be the music that dies, the trust in that data and then pushing back and Federal Reserve independence and just the, you know, the volatility go. It's I think the way gold's looking at this right now is it's just waiting for the next catalyst to shoot up up to a new high in the macro is building a really good support around 3300 an ounce and that's been happening for four or five months. We call it a bull flag. And I think the key catalysts for gold to just break out higher. So just a little bit of back and fill in the US stock market, a little bit of volatility and it's August volatility is very low. Wow. The bull flag is 3300. Did I hear that right? Yeah, the base of the bull for the first time we traded three 300 ever was in April. That big swing in the stock market. Gold went up And of course, it's been kind of hanging out since then. But what's happened since then? There's been more central bank buying and a significant shift in ETF. ETF flows to inflows for four years outflows. Now this year we have almost 10% of inflows. That means almost 9 million ounces of gold just flown in. People are buying gold and looking for protection, I think, and looking for a store value. Really fascinating all time high. 22nd of July, right? 34, 43, 70. And it's been basing ever since that swoon following Liberation Day. Yeah, there you see it. 3408 Right now we're down a bit. 3300 is where Mike has support. Where's resistance? Because we're going to bump into some overhead here around 3400, right. Yeah. So 3500 is really the high for the year in the cash market and the futures were a little distorted. Remember, those futures were always stacked higher price because the cost to care, you have to add that price into the futures. So to me, it's everybody's know 3500 just a matter of time to get to the next round number, which is 4000. Fantastic. All right. And the more gold leaf that goes into the Oval Office, that doesn't impact the price, does it? Well, it's all part of the bull side. He's not using silver. It's not. You know, I've got Mike McGlone on the line. So I've got to ask you just in our remaining moment about Bitcoin here, Mike, Bitcoin loves Trump as well, and he's been awfully good for it. With 401 KS added to the mix, we could be looking at a new all time high here as well. What's your expectation? Right? Well, I think that could happen to me. The Joe The biggest problem with Bitcoin is it's a risk on acid and it's much more likely to go up if the stock market goes up. Gold is a risk off asset. It's actually been negative in stock markets. The stock market goes up, gold might suffer, but stock market goes down. I think that gold is going to really beat Bitcoin this year and so far they're about the same. So you're telling me I need both. Mike McGlone, it's great to see you. Thank you so much. With a red hat on the terminal, gold will not be tariffs. Maybe that's the actual news today from this White House as we wait for a China truce deadline to move tomorrow. And of course, we'll be looking both ways when we leave the bureau here. 800 National Guard troops deployed to the streets of Washington, D.C., the police department federalized. And we're going to have a lot more on all of this in Late Edition, the balance of power. Meet us 5 p.m. Eastern, only here on Bloomberg TV and radio.",
