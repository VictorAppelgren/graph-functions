  "title": "I have a store credit at Reformation. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m buying during its rare sale",
  "description": "This time around, tons of best sellers, newly released items and seasonal favorites are 30% off.",
  "content": "Earlier in the year, I covered Reformation\u2019s last sale that had savings of up to 70% off. This time around, tons of best sellers, newly released items and seasonal favorites are 30% off. While the discount isn\u2019t as high as the clear out in January, it\u2019s more consistent and tons of coveted styles are available to shop \u2014 plus the stock of available sizes and colors is remarkable.\n\nI\u2019m personally shopping this sale because I\u2019ve been patiently waiting for the brand to have a sale since I need a little wardrobe refresh ahead of fall. With a vacation coming up, concerts to attend and more, I\u2019m ready to add a few pieces to my closet. Shop 15 of my favorite picks below.\n\nWhy this Reformation sale is worth shopping\n\nIf you\u2019re a follower of the sustainable clothing brand, you are probably aware that they rarely have sales and never keep a section of markdowns on site or in store outside of these limited events. I\u2019ve been shopping at Reformation and consistently shop there for wedding guest dresses, other formal events and even for some basics.\n\nWith September just a few weeks away, many of us need new staple pieces for the fall and winter months and Reformation is a great retailer to flock to for capsule wardrobe items and fashion deals. Think basic tees, timeless sweaters, ethically made denim and more.\n\nOur deals team has over a decade of combined commerce journalism experience. Rikka Altland, Jacqueline Saguin and Elena Matarazzo source the deals for the day each morning to curate one-offs and retailer-specific roundups of the best sales to shop. Searching everything from coveted pieces from Lululemon to the best picks from Dyson\u2019s sale, the team works across a wide variety of categories to ensure we\u2019re finding the best buys for our readers.",

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Fiona Sinclair Scott is CNN Style\u2019s global editor. This is an edited version of an article published in 2022.\nThere\u2019s a scene from the original incarnation of MTV\u2019s aughts-era reality TV series \u201cThe Hills\u201d in which main character Lauren Conrad has her outfit assessed by a fashion stylist within minutes of starting an internship at Teen Vogue. She wants to make sure she\u2019s looking her best before meeting Lisa Love, who was the title\u2019s editor-in-chief at the time, and so tweaks are made \u2014 \u201cmaybe just something to cover your shoulders,\u201d suggests the stylist before giving her a jacket \u2014 before Conrad\u2019s outfit is deemed suitable for her new workplace.\nIt\u2019s a ludicrous moment and something that wouldn\u2019t happen now, or even back then, in most offices. But if you\u2019re about to start a new job and worried about what to wear, this guide \u2014 with input from four fashion insiders \u2014 should help you navigate the tricky business of dressing for work.\nOne caveat: If your sartorial energy is akin to Julia Roberts playing Erin Brockovich (\u201cAs long as I\u2019ve got one ass instead of two, I\u2019ll wear what I like if that\u2019s all right with you\u201d), you don\u2019t need me or this guide, you need a high five. Keep it up.\nFormalities out of the way, read on for everything you need to know about dressing for the office.\nThe green tip: Shop your wardrobe\nWhen in a sartorial panic, there\u2019s a tendency to solve it with a shopping spree. But as we all wise up to the impact of our consumption habits on the planet, consider this sustainable alternative: Get your hand out of your pocket and dig deep inside your wardrobe instead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first step,\u201d said Los Angeles-based stylist Cassandra Dittmer, who suggests you figure out what you have, what you love, what needs repair and what you might want to pass on. \u201cHopefully (you\u2019ll) uncover some hidden gems.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of the process, you should feel a deeper connection to your wardrobe, find the gaps that need filling and give yourself a great basis to work from each day when putting your outfits together with ease.\u201d\nI did this last month and rediscovered an old pair of trousers that I\u2019m wearing again after re-dying them black. (Faded black jeans, trousers and sweaters really benefit from running them through a wash cycle with an at-home clothes dye capsule, such as the kind made by Dylon).\nBonus tip: If you live in a country with hot and cold seasons, pack your summer clothes away when fall arrives. You\u2019ll be surprised by the aura of newness they take on when you retrieve them from storage months later.\nDittmer, who has built her styling business around eco-conscious values, suggests you may want to go further and channel your inner Cher Horowitz (\u00e0 la the movie \u201cClueless\u201d): \u201cDocument your looks and take pictures of outfits you love and feel most confident in. A convenient folder on your phone will make a quick and handy reference point when you are scrambling to pack for a work trip or getting ready in the morning.\u201d\nThe basics: Polished comfort\nThere\u2019s a way to dress comfortably without looking bedraggled, and with many employers loosening up on the rules, it\u2019s a great time to try a polished but casual look.\nJoanna Dai, who left her job in finance to start her own eponymous fashion brand, has noticed a trend away from overly formal office fashion conventions like formal suits and restrictive pencil skirts.\n\u201cIn the new normal things have gotten more casual in office,\u201d said Dai, noting that, as companies recognize the importance of well-being at work, many have adopted more relaxed dress codes that allow for jeans and sneakers or done away with dress codes altogether.\nEmbracing more casual attire while also looking professional begins with understanding the importance of quality materials, fit and color.\n\u201cNever underestimate the power of a good fit,\u201d Dittmer said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking expensive, Savile Row tailoring \u2013 but making sure your trousers are cut to the most flattering fit can be a huge improvement and make you feel really well put together. Most dry cleaners offer very accessible tailoring services.\u201d\nModel and the founder of size-inclusive fashion brand Henning, Lauren Chan, agreed a good tailor is important, adding, \u201cHere\u2019s a secret: Clothes aren\u2019t actually meant to fit you. They\u2019re built to fit an \u2018average build\u2019 which is \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 no one. Buy clothes that fit you across your widest part (for me, it\u2019s my waist) and tailor the rest inward.\u201d\nWhen it comes to materials, most linens, while beautiful, wrinkle easily and are not going to be your friend throughout an eight-hour day at a desk job. On the other hand, polyester is pretty wrinkle-resistant, but it\u2019s a synthetic fabric that\u2019s terrible for the planet and doesn\u2019t breathe \u2013 putting you at risk of unsightly sweat patches and a guilty conscience. Check labels for organic and sustainably made cotton or new fabrics made with a high percentage of recycled materials.\nDai puts a lot of emphasis on what she calls \u201chigh-functioning\u201d environmentally friendly materials, such as micromodal (made from the cellulose of natural beechwood trees in a closed-loop, carbon neutral process) or recycled polyamide (made from plastic waste like fishing nets and carpet). Many of the items in her lines are made from wrinkle-resistant, machine washable, stretch materials that are great for people with busy schedules who don\u2019t have time to iron or make regular trips to the dry cleaner.\nOlie Arnold, style director at menswear e-commerce site Mr Porter, suggests opting for unlined suits. \u201cGo for suits and jackets which are unlined and deconstructed with a breathable fabric,\u201d he said, \u201cas they will give you a smart look with a comfortable fit.\u201d\nAnd, he advises, if you want to relax your suit further, don\u2019t bother with a formal shirt. \u201cIf you can push the envelope a little at your workplace, a merino wool long-sleeve polo is a perfect companion, breaking up your outfit without losing that professional look.\u201d Merino wool is naturally temperature regulating, too.\nPersonally, I also love an oversize jacket and slouchy suits, and there are many options out there right now at a range of price points. Brands like Arket (another Scandinavian label within the H&M group) offer some solid midrange casual suits. Keep the jacket unbuttoned always and wear a good quality cotton T-shirt underneath. Pair it with boots or sneakers (French brand Veja has good green credentials, offering many styles appropriate for the office).\nThe aside: A note for newbies\nIf you\u2019re about to start your very first job, you might be looking at walking into your office without any prior reference for what people typically wear.\nFirst off, just ask \u2014 it\u2019s totally reasonable to ask your new manager what the vibe is. And if you\u2019re still unsure, remember this sound advice from Arnold: \u201cBe yourself, dress for the occasion and make sure you feel comfortable. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable in what you wear, it can reflect on how you present yourself and your productivity.\u201d\nThe golden rule: Create your own uniform and then build on it\nSet yourself up by establishing some staple pieces that can form the basis of your work wardrobe. A great pair of black trousers, a blazer and some quality shirts can go a long way.\nDrawing on her own closet as an example, Dai said, \u201cI have a uniform or a capsule collection in my wardrobe. I\u2019ve got a skinny-ankle trouser which is great for cycling into work because they won\u2019t get caught on the chain. I also have a wide-leg just to add that difference in the week\u2026And then one or two good blazers.\u201d\nEvery item in your collection of staples should be something you can imagine wearing multiple times in a week, and you should be able to style each item in at least three different outfits.\nIn cooler months, a well-tailored pair of trousers paired with quality knitwear and a boot is fuss-free, especially if you stick to classic colors like black, navy, grays and tans, which are very easy to interchange. The knitwear can be swapped out for a blouse or shirt in warmer weather for a similar effect.\nSkirts can play into this uniform, too. An A-line skirt cut an inch or two above the knee with a crisp white shirt with a French tuck (a more relaxed approach where the back of your shirt remains mostly untucked) could be added into your rotation in warmer months. Also, midlength skirts pair nicely with structured, thick cotton T-shirts or a thin wool sweater.\nThe twist: Accessorize\nMix up the uniform with jewelry and accessories. I\u2019m a big fan of the workwear uniform, but I\u2019ll mix it up with some form of accessory.\nArnold points to footwear as another way to elevate a simple look. \u201cA classic hard shoe, such as a pair of Penny Loafers from John Lobb or George Cleverley, are a personal staple. You can\u2019t go wrong with their practicality and long-lasting craftsmanship, whilst (they) can easily elevate an outfit if you go a little more casual.\u201d\nA pair of tan flats are also great if you don\u2019t want to wear sneakers. Go for a sharp, pointed toe as opposed to anything rounded. Also, a beautiful silk scarf (worn folded into a triangle and draped over your shoulders), a watch or \u2013 my personal favorite \u2013 big earrings can be quite impactful.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an investment piece, I\u2019d always (much to my bank account\u2019s horror) splash out on a bag. A beautifully crafted handbag or tote will last forever and immediately lift a look. If that sounds expensive, scroll down for tips on renting. Alternatively, the luxury resale market is booming. Use sites like Vestiaire or Resee to find deals on pre-vetted, secondhand luxury items.\nThe debate: To denim or not to denim\nA no-denim policy might be the last bastion of formal workwear culture at some corporate workplaces, but for many companies, denim is absolutely acceptable.\n\u201cI really do believe you can wear denim, even in more formal offices (or) at least on a Friday,\u201d said Dai, who added that she preferred black denim when she still worked in a corporate setting. \u201cIf you\u2019re not seeing clients or you have clients who are more casual than you are then I think (if you\u2019re considering) a denim for a lunch meeting, go for it!\u201d\nDittmer agrees. \u201cTo ease yourself in, start with dark, straight-leg denim which can look really polished. Denim can be a great base layer for crisp shirting, beautiful blouses, and is a great way to break out of your classic work uniform style and branch out into more playful looks.\u201d\nLook for darker denim washes, and a classic straight or wide leg. Gen Z ruled out skinny jeans last year, much to the despair of many millennials, and \u2013 while I don\u2019t live and die by trends \u2013 I think they might have a point. Also, keep your ankles away at work (a tiny hint is fine but avoid a cropped jean). And while we\u2019re seeing a lot of low-slung options on the runway as the fashion world continues to be inspired by Y2K style, high-waisted options are the best bet for the office (they\u2019re also the most flattering).\nThe pep talk: Don\u2019t forget to have fun\nStarting a new job can be daunting \u2014 you\u2019ll be meeting new people, spending time in a new environment and taking in a lot of new information. What you wear shouldn\u2019t add to the stress. Lean into the chance to express yourself and play with fashion. Use clothes to set the mood for your day, depending on what\u2019s on the agenda.\nRenting is an excellent way to experiment and add some fun pieces to your wardrobe. For Dittmer, \u201cIt\u2019s a great low-commitment, low-cost way to try out new styles and brands.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also a great way to inject a little bit of luxury into your life. I pay for a monthly subscription to a rental company called Cocoon that allows me to select one designer bag every four weeks to be delivered to my door. The one I\u2019m sporting this month retails around $2,000, but it cost me $130. Renting is also a great option should you need to dress up for a work event. More and more online styling services are popping up with plenty of partywear.\nAbove all, remember that fashion is supposed to be fun.

      "text": "The \u201cdark academic\u201d is smart but sullen, effortlessly cool but largely withdrawn, with rings under their eyes (spending all night in dimly lit libraries) and bruised legs (getting up to no good in between courses \u2013 a dark academic typically has a dark secret).\nThey\u2019ve got an eye for Gothic architecture and can wax poetic about Keats, Woolf and other titans of the Western canon. They sip tea by candlelight, stay up late writing at their vintage desk and thrive when the weather is dreary.\nAnd most often, the dark academic is a TikTok user, emulating a look they\u2019ve only seen onscreen or in books, and living a version of a dream life in which they can spend their days reading the classics in a centuries-old library.\n\u201cDark academia,\u201d for all its tweed blazers, scuffed loafers and schoolgirl-plaid skirts, isn\u2019t just a material aesthetic for some, but a lifestyle. Its sacred texts include Donna Tartt\u2019s \u201cThe Secret History\u201d and Oscar Wilde\u2019s classic \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray.\u201d Many of its acolytes harbored dreams of attending storied schools across the pond and studying history, art or classic literature \u2013 subjects some college students might be discouraged from pursuing.\nThat\u2019s what drew Talya Glowacz, who posts on TikTok as CosyAcademia, to the aesthetic \u2013 the \u201cromanticization of learning.\u201d Before the pandemic, she was attending a master\u2019s degree program at the University of Exeter in England with plans to become a college professor. When Covid-19 sent her back to the US, she longed to return to her historic campus. Finding dark academia was the next best thing.\n\u201cI think that building these \u2018aesthetic\u2019 communities virtually via social media has allowed for a lot of people to meet friends and explore their interests despite the isolation of the pandemic,\u201d she told CNN in an email.\nSchool\u2019s been in and out since March 2020, so dressing \u2013 and living \u2013 like a \u201cdark academic\u201d is a way for followers to meld their uniform past, unstable present and aspirational future.\nDark academia combines smarts and style\nThough versions of \u201cdark academia\u201d permeated Tumblr and Pinterest in the mid-2010s, the trend resurged in popularity when the pandemic began. Being forcibly separated from her school by Covid-19 made Glowacz crave the experience all the more \u2013 she wanted to romanticize an experience she\u2019d lost.\nShe wasn\u2019t alone \u2013 the hashtag gained traction on TikTok at the end of 2020 and continued to gain momentum and find fans. Soon, young people stuck at home were donning wooly sweaters over collared shirts and pulling up knee-high socks for looks that resembled uniforms they might have seen in \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d or \u201cDerry Girls.\u201d\nFashion is one of the draws of dark academia \u2013 sweater vests are in! \u2013 but it\u2019s ballooned into something far wider. On TikTok, users share violin renditions of Arctic Monkeys anthems, cosplay scenes as schoolboys running from an unknown evil and pleasing close-ups of tea being poured, rain beating against a bedroom window and the flicker of a waning flame.\n\u201cIt\u2019s portrayed generally as a sort of secretive, individual, and intense thirst for knowledge which is what makes it moody and \u2018dark\u2019 academia,\u201d Glowacz said.\nIn Glowacz\u2019s videos, she shares her collection of antique leather-bound books, creates grainy videos of sealing envelopes with wax from a melted candle and outfit pairings for every season. While the fashion elements of the aesthetic are fun to play with, she said that she\u2019s happier finding friends with similar interests, not just similar style.\nAlice Sidgwick, a lifelong reader who \u201cloves studying, writing, vintage clothes and old buildings,\u201d said she didn\u2019t so much \u201cjoin\u201d the trend as she did discover an umbrella under which her pre-existing interests fell.\n\u201cDark Academia really is just a shorthand for all the things I like,\u201d Sidgwick, DarkAcademiaCandles on TikTok, told CNN in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see people posting things that are celebrating how hard they\u2019re studying, or painting, or writing, and that other people can join in on that. I think that\u2019s a very positive thing to come out of TikTok.\u201d\nWhen the pandemic began, Sidgwick started selling candles inspired by characters from classic literature \u2013 a vetiver and mahogany scent for Mr. Darcy, amber and vanilla for Jay Gatsby \u2013 complete with a handwritten love letter, wax-sealed, from the character. When she discovered the dark academia hashtag on TikTok, she knew she found her customer base. Now, her business is named for the aesthetic she loves.\nDark academia can have a dark side\nSome of the \u201cdark academia\u201d elements that its followers love are what make it potentially problematic to others.\nRowan Ellis, a UK YouTuber who creates videos on LGBTQ history, said in a 2021 video that the elitism and emphasis on White authors and artists baked into dark academia can be limiting and harmful.\nEllis said in the video she attended Durham University, a prestigious college whose town often appears in aspirational \u201cdark academia\u201d posts. But her experience there didn\u2019t reflect those fantasies \u2013 there, and at other universities in the UK, classism made students feel unwelcome and a lack of financial support left them saddled with debt.\nThe Western cannon of \u201cclassic literature\u201d is largely comprised of White authors writing about White protagonists, Amal Abdi wrote for Refinery29. And because prestigious institutions for so long excluded Black students and people of color, when their history goes unquestioned or even celebrated, dark academics may perpetuate the same exclusion, Ellis said.\n\u201cThey wear the style of the elite and valorize the subjects of those institutions, but the long tradition of student protest and political engagement seems missing in a lot of cases,\u201d she said in the video.\nDark academia isn\u2019t inherently offensive, Ellis said, but to make it an inclusive community, its followers should reckon with the history of the institutions they valorize.\nThe trend keeps growing\nNewer creators are working to dismantle the predominantly White reputation of dark academia. Books like \u201cAce of Spades\u201d by Faridah \u00c0b\u00edk\u00e9-\u00cdy\u00edm\u00edd\u00e9, about two private school students whose futures are threatened by a dangerous bully, and films like \u201cSelah and the Spades,\u201d about a popular group at a prestigious boarding school who harbor dark secrets, center Black protagonists in familiar stories. Dark academics from all backgrounds are adding them to lists of recommended reading and viewing. (Though the book and film share similar titles, they\u2019re set at different institutions with unrelated characters.)\nTikTok users like CosyFaerie create content for what she calls the \u201cBlack girl, dark academia side of TikTok,\u201d where she dons frilly shirts to sip tea, reads a yellowed copy of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d and tours museums.\n\u201cI was obsessed with dark academia \u2026 but could barely see any representation,\u201d she wrote in one video. \u201cSo I decided to do it myself [smiley emoji] and add a little bit of spice.\u201d\nDark academia\u2019s appeal is wide and only growing (and it\u2019s seasonally appropriate, too \u2013 nothing says \u201cwinter\u201d like curling up with a book in bed or layering with a thick sweater). And even with school mostly back in session, Glowacz still takes comfort in the world of dark academia, where it\u2019s perpetually drizzling and there\u2019s always a piping-hot cup of tea waiting for her."

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, \u2018Look of the Week\u2019 is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.\nWhen Gigi Hadid stepped onto the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d red carpet premiere in New York on Monday, she dusted off a Y2K summer staple, sporting a yellow triangle top bound to give any millennial an immediate flashback (and possibly a hot flash).\nIf crop tops could talk, the triangle \u2014 also known as a handkerchief or bandana top \u2014 is the one most likely to gossip about you behind your back, and serves as a sure-fire signal of sex appeal and cool-girl status.\nFamously worn by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jennifer Aniston, the triangle top was inherently Brat two decades before \u201cBrat girl summer\u201d was officially coined. A quintessential going-out top, it evoked a sense of effortlessness; you were so hot, you could simply tie a hair accessory around yourself as a shirt and pull it off. The triangle spawned offshoots too \u2014 its sister, the scarf top, was suggestively tied into a bra by Christina Aguilera.\nTrue to the legend of the aughts, Hadid styled the minimal fabric maximally with a matching yellow low-slung knee-length skirt and peeping black underwear, a super-wide brown belt and equally wide stacked bangles, pointed black pumps and a color-coordinated charmed-out handbag. The matchy-yet-busy Miu Miu ensemble (all in leather, which is having a sweaty moment this summer) was a perfect time-capsule of yesteryear, with internet commenters on Reddit dubbing it \u201cFergalicious,\u201d referring to the singer Fergie\u2019s distinctive application of millennium style.\nBut while Hadid\u2019s triangle top stood out for its nostalgic appeal, the style has lurked on the fashion periphery in recent years as crop tops have remained a fixture. Emily Ratajowski, Bella Hadid and Sydney Sweeney have all worn variations on the style, with Kylie Jenner repping the same Miu Miu top and skirt set as Hadid\u2019s in black last month.\nJoined by her friend Blake Lively on the red carpet (clad in a lacy red Versace catsuit), Hadid\u2019s look was meant to be a coordination of sorts, the hues evoking the signature colors of the franchise\u2019s titular superheroes, played by Lively\u2019s husband Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, with Lively\u2019s a more on-the-nose interpretation of Deadpool\u2019s predilection for spandex.\nBut the appearance also marked a shift in the now ubiquitous world of premiere \u2018method dressing\u2019 for top-billed actors. \u2014 in New York, Reynolds and Jackman wore black suits, leaving it to Lively and Hadid (neither appear in the film) to pick up the theme. Perhaps reluctant to get too coordinated, a la the classic looks of Destiny\u2019s Child, the result was ultimately discordant, with silhouettes and materials at odds, carefully avoiding the trap of looking too ketchup and mustard.\nThough triangle tops are meant to seem easy and breezy, they can be a nuisance for small and large breasts alike; they\u2019re also impractical anywhere there\u2019s wind or an air conditioner. For that reason, Hadid hopefully had a jacket in tow for the chilly indoor theater \u2014 perhaps the translucent trench she changed into for the after party, also in Wolverine yellow."

      "text": "When Gen Z + TikTok declare a fashion trend as \u201ccheugy,\u201d it means it\u2019s over. The rest of us are expected to just move along to the next thing.\nBut what happens when Gen Z gets caught between two diametrically opposed trends, one threatening to cancel out the other, and both beloved by teen shoppers?\nWhat we\u2019re talking about here is the struggle between fitted leggings versus baggy jeans.\nBefore they declared \u201cskinny\u201d anything to be out, Gen Zers were passionate about fitted leggings, a longtime staple in their closets. It\u2019s why athleisure brand Lululemon (LULU) and its pricey $100 to $130 leggings have consistently ranked as a coveted brand among that demographic, whose members are those born after 1997.\nIn Piper Sandler\u2019s recent 42nd semi-annual \u201cTaking Stock With Teens\u201d survey of 10,000 Gen Z consumers, Lululemon once again emerged as a preferred brand of young consumers this year, ranking as their fifth-favorite clothing brand after Nike, American Eagle Outfitters, Pacsun and Adidas.\nMillennials, for their part, are grateful to their successive generation\u2019s penchant for leggings because they, too, obsessively wear them to grab a cup of coffee, for school dropoffs, even to work. And whatever the teen consumer powerhouse still likes is what retailers are keeping in stock.\nBut now, Gen Z is showing that, even in leggings, \u201cskinny\u201d is almost done. On TikTok, they\u2019ve been swooning over \u201cflared\u201d leggings for months, otherwise known as yoga pants.\nIt\u2019s yet another example of Gen Z\u2019s fondness for resurrecting popular style trends of the past (baggy jeans, scrunchies, tracksuits, chunky plastic jewelry.)\nPopular influencer Emma Chamberlain, with her nearly 15 million followers on Instagram and close to 11 million on TikTok, has championed flared leggings on social media since last fall. Zoom into 2021 and flared leggings have popped up at a slew of teen-friendly chains, including Pacsun, Lululemon, Gap (GPS) and Athleta.\n\u201cFrom a teen perspective, Lululemon is still a No. 1 brand with high schoolers but there is a nod to baggy trousers, pants and leggings now in their wardrobe,\u201d said Erinn Murphy, managing director and senior research analyst with Piper Sander.\nAnd for those teens who still wear skinny leggings, they are styling the look as a \u201ctriangle\u201d or \u201cinverted triangle, she said. \u201cSo its baggy t-shirt with skinny leggings or a shorter top with a looser pant,\u201d said Murphy.\nPacsun president Brieane Olson said the push for loose 70\u2019s flares and 80\u2019s baggy styles in pants and leggings is dominating Gen Z, and the styles are popping up heavily on TikTok and Instagram reels.\nConsequently, she said, \u201cat Pacsun we\u2019re seeing a sizable shift into looser silhouettes in bottoms across both our men\u2019s and women\u2019s consumer. Wide leg, loose fit or baggy, flare and super flare, and boot cut are surging denim trends with our Pacsun consumer.\u201d\nOlson went as far as to say that skinny pants have begun to lose currency with Gen Z over the past few years, and \u201cgoing into 2022 will become close to obsolete for our consumer.\nMarket research firm NPD Group noted in a recent report that consumers overall have adopted more casual and cozy fashion styles \u201cfrom head to toe.\u201d\nIn the women\u2019s jeans and active bottoms categories, such as leggings, looser fitting styles are gaining share, said Maria Rugolo, fashion apparel analyst with NPD Group.\n\u201cWe are starting to see some looser fits in active apparel, as well,\u201d she said. \u201cFlare is the style right now and TikTok is having a moment with it.\u201d"
