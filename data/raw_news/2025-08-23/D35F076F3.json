Some financial institutions \u2014 namely investment banks, where most Wall Streeters start out \u2014 now scout young talent during their sophomore year of college. That means those who wait, or don't learn the recruiting game quickly enough, risk being left behind altogether.\n\"It forces students to focus very early at a time when, in my opinion, they should be not focusing, but actually broadening their perspectives,\" Gustavo Schwed, an NYU professor who worked in investment banking and private equity before switching to academia, said.\nA Wharton student who recently signed a 2026 internship offer at an investment bank put it this way: \"I am a sophomore in college, and it's kind of outrageous that we have to decide at this age \u2014 I just turned 20 \u2014 what my first job is out of college.\"\nShe got a job with KKR after being rejected by Henry Kravis. Here's how.\nThe secret backdoor to a career on Wall Street: student finance clubs\nMy career has taken me to Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Google.

See the firms young people want to work for today.\nSee where the average Wall Street worker went to college and how much she earns\nFrom enormous payouts to pink slips: What it's like to work at a hedge fund right now\nThe new finance career path\nBusiness Insider talked to college students, recruiters, finance executives, professors, and many others about what it takes to build a career in finance in 2025. We compiled what we learned into a series of stories and videos that started rolling out on April 16 and which will continue through May. The series seeks to help students better understand what it takes to break into Wall Street and what to expect once they get there.\nCheck back here to see the latest.
