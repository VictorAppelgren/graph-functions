  "title": "Trump authorized to control DC police indefinitely under House GOP proposal",
  "description": "Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., plans to introduce a resolution to remove the 30-day limit on President Donald Trump's control of Washington D.C.'s police force and allow for indefinite federal oversight.",
  "content": "A House Republican wants to allow President Donald Trump to extend his takeover of Washington, D.C.\u2019s police force for as long as he wants.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., is working on a resolution that would rewrite the Home Rule Act, the law that Trump is using to take control of the district\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), and do away with barriers that limit just how long the president can oversee the local police agency.\n\nOgles charged that \"the only way to save it is to federalize the District.\"\n\n\"President Trump has already stepped up \u2014 using the emergency powers granted under the D.C. Home Rule Act \u2014 but the 30-day limit in current law is nowhere near enough to undo the chaos Democrats have unleashed,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"My resolution will give the President all the time and authority he needs to crush lawlessness, restore order, and reclaim our capital once and for all.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS READY TO SUPPORT TRUMP'S MOVE TO SKIRT CONGRESS IN DC CRIME CRACKDOWN\n\nTrump on Monday declared a crime emergency in the nation\u2019s Capitol and invoked a section of the Home Rule Act that governs the district to give himself the authority to take control of the local police.\n\nHe has since sent in National Guard troops, alongside FBI and DEA agents, to patrol the streets of Washington D.C.\n\nBut the provision, known as Section 740 of the Home Rule Act, only allows for the president to effectively federalize the local police force for up to 30 days unless Congress, through a joint resolution, grants him an extension.\n\nAnd Ogles\u2019 resolution seeks to change that by removing the 30-day time limit.\n\nTOP HOUSE REPUBLICAN SAYS TRUMP 'RIGHTLY' TOOK OVER DC POLICE, DEMANDS BOWSER, OTHERS TESTIFY ON CRIME\n\nInstead, the president would have to notify the House Oversight and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees each time he wants to extend his control of the police force \u2014 something Trump had to do already to prevent his grip on the MPD from lapsing after 48 hours.\n\nAnd that authority would continue unless Congress passed a joint resolution calling for an end to his control of the D.C. police.\n\nOgles\u2019 legislation is part of his broader push to repeal the Home Rule Act. Indeed, he and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, have a bill called the Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident (BOWSER) Act, named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, that would repeal the decades-old law and return control of the city to Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has already floated leapfrogging Congress to extend his hold on the police given that a joint resolution would likely require at least 60 votes in the Senate to pass.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile some Republicans have come out in support of the president, Senate Democrats are ready to push back against granting Trump more control over the district.\n\n\"No f\u2011\u2011\u2011--- way,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told podcaster Aaron Parnas on his show, \"The Parnas Perspective.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ll fight him tooth and nail.\u2026 He needs to get Congress to approve it, and not only are we not going to approve it, but there are some Republicans who don\u2019t like it either,\" he continued.",

      "text": "A Senate Republican renewed his push to federalize Washington, D.C., following an attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer and President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put the District under federal control.\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has long called for control of Washington to fall under Congress, going so far as to introduce the Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident (BOWSER) Act, named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, in an effort to combat crime in the District.\nREPUBLICAN BILL WOULD PUT 'ANARCHIST JURISDICTIONS' ON NOTICE, THREATEN FEDERAL FUNDING\nThe bill, which Lee introduced alongside Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., has not made it out of committee since being dropped in February. But Trump\u2019s highlight of an attack against former DOGE staffer Edward Coristine, also known as \"Big Balls,\" has resurrected the discussion.\n\"The Constitution already federalizes D.C.,\" Lee said on X. \"We just need Congress to do its job \u2014 and reassert its lawmaking power over our nation\u2019s capital city. My bill, the BOWSER Act, would do that.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Lee for further comment.\nLee\u2019s bill would effectively repeal the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a law passed in the 1970s that established a city council and mayor and reduced the amount of oversight that Congress has over the city and its affairs.\nBut calls have grown by lawmakers over the years to increase Congress\u2019 oversight of the city, largely centered on concerns over increased crime and criticisms of attempts to rewrite the District\u2019s criminal code.\nAnd Trump jumped into the discourse, too, threatening that if \"D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City.\"\n\"Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime,\" Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City.\"\nFox News reached out to Bowser\u2019s office for comment but did not immediately hear back.\n'SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED': GOP SENATORS FIGHT FOR UNIFIED MESSAGE ON TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nZack Smith, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation and a former prosecutor, told Fox News Digital that in the past, the D.C. council has pushed \"policies that have made it much more difficult for law enforcement, for prosecutors, to do their jobs and keep citizens safe.\"\nBowser and the D.C. Council have, for several years, worked to update the District\u2019s criminal code. However, changes to the code that would have severely lowered sentencing for a variety of crimes that were at first vetoed by Bowser were on the precipice of becoming law before Congress and former President Joe Biden overrode the reforms.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSmith noted that Congress still has the authority to legislate the District, meaning that lawmakers and the federal government are \"still the backstop,\" and that both Trump and Lee were right to call for a \"reevaluation of the District\u2019s status.\"\n\"That's why Congress was able to step in and overturn that proposed radical rewrite of the Criminal Code,\" he said. \"And so what the BOWSER Act would actually do, if it repeals home rule, it would essentially change the way the local D.C. government functions. It might involve Congress and the Federal Government taking a more direct role.\"\n\"I think there is broad and in some ways bipartisan consensus that the current system in D.C. is not working as it should,\" he continued."

      "text": "President Donald Trump signaled he may skirt Congress to extend his takeover of the Washington, D.C., police, and some congressional Republicans are heeding the call.\nSen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said he would vote for extending Trump\u2019s authority but didn\u2019t believe that Senate Democrats would budge and support giving the president more time.\n\"I'm absolutely in favor of President Trump doing whatever he needs to do,\" Marshall told Fox News Digital. \"Of course, we want to follow the Constitution, and I need to go back and read what he can do and not do, but I think it'll take a 60-vote threshold in the Senate to pass this resolution.\"\nTRUMP PREDICTS LITTLE PROGRESS IN POTENTIAL SHUTDOWN TALKS WITH 'CRAZY' SCHUMER, JEFFRIES\nThe provision allows for the president to effectively federalize the local police force for up to 30 days, unless Congress, through a joint resolution, grants him an extension. But questions remain over whether that kind of resolution would hit the Senate\u2019s typical 60-vote threshold or if it could pass through a simple majority.\nTrump on Monday invoked a section of the Home Rule Act that governs the district to give himself the authority to take control of the Metropolitan Police Department and has since sent in National Guard troops, alongside FBI and DEA agents, to patrol the streets.\nRepublicans control 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning Democrats may be needed to grant Trump an extension beyond the 30-day window. But Trump, during a press conference Wednesday announcing new Kennedy Center honorees, said that he would be asking for \"long-term extensions\" and believed Democrats would not \"do anything to stop crime.\"\nTrump also noted he may not need Congress.\n\"Well, if it's a national emergency, we can do it without Congress,\" Trump said. \"But we expect to be \u2026 before Congress, very quickly.\nTRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\n\"We're going to do this very quickly, but we're going to want extensions,\" he added. \"I don't want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will, but I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously.\"\nHouse Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, whose committee oversees the district, enthusiastically backed Trump's move to take control of D.C.'s police force Monday. When asked by Fox News Digital if he would back Trump leapfrogging Congress to continue his hold on the local police, a spokesman said, \"We support the president\u2019s actions to complete the mission.\"\nBoth Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., initially supported the president\u2019s move to crack down on crime in the district, which was spurred by a recent attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer.\nWhen asked for comment on Trump\u2019s latest remarks regarding an extension, Thune\u2019s office referred Fox News Digital to his previous statement on social media in which the GOP leader lauded the administration\u2019s move.\n\"Washington, D.C., should be a place where people can safely live, visit, work, and raise a family, and [Monday\u2019s] announcement is a positive step in that direction,\" he said.\nFox News Digital reached out to Johnson\u2019s office for comment but did not hear back.\nA clearer picture of where lawmakers stand will likely have to wait, given that they are out of town in their respective states and districts for much of the 30-day window. But the issue will likely be front of mind when they return after Labor Day.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nStill, Trump already has some public support from Republicans for extending his timeframe.\nSen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., told Fox News Digital in a statement he fully supported \"President Trump's plan to make D.C. safe again, and will back up his efforts in the Senate.\"\nAnd Sen. Mike Lee, who has a bill that would repeal the Home Rule Act and federalize the district, similarly would support extending the 30-day window, \"with the ultimate goal of working with him to pass the BOWSER Act and restore full Congressional oversight of the city.\"\n\"The safety and sanity of our nation\u2019s capital should not depend upon having good presidents in the Oval Office, but I\u2019m glad we have one now,\" the Utah Republican told Fox News Digital in a statement."

Andy Ogles is proposing a resolution to allow President Trump to extend his control over Washington, D.C.'s police force indefinitely, aiming to remove the current 30-day limit set by the Home Rule Act. Trump has already declared a crime emergency in D.C. and invoked federal powers to take control of the Metropolitan Police Department, deploying National Guard troops to address rising crime. While some Republicans support this move, Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are firmly opposed and vow to challenge any attempts to extend Trump's authority without congressional approval.",
