  "title": "Gen Z is getting serious about their finances. What's in the way?",
  "description": "Gen Z is slowly stepping off their parents' payroll, but a majority are dissatisfied with their income and the cost of living.",
  "content": "Members of Generation Z are becoming more financially independent, a likely welcome reprieve for the bank of mom and dad.\n\nOver the last 12 months, 72% of Gen Z took steps to improve their financial health, and fewer Zers are relying on monetary support from family, according to a new Bank of America survey of 1,069 adults. Between rent and groceries, young Americans aren\u2019t happy with the high cost of living but they\u2019re reacting to it responsibly, according to Holly O\u2019Neill, Bank of America\u2019s president of retail, consumer and preferred banking.\n\nWhile they may be known for challenging traditional workplace norms and the Gen Z stare, Zoomers are also leading the way in prioritizing income diversification, entrepreneurship, and values-based spending.\n\n\u201cGen Z is learning adulting is expensive, but the good news is they\u2019re taking it in stride\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThey\u2019re saving more and investing. I think they\u2019re feeling pretty good, given where they are.\u201d\n\nWhile not all 18- to 28-year-olds have left their parents\u2019 payroll, the percentage of Gen Zers who rely on family financial support is now 39%, down from 46% last year.\n\nTaylor Price, a Gen Z personal finance expert and founder of Priceless Tay, a platform and coaching program teaching young people how to thrive financially, said that decrease doesn\u2019t only reflect Gen Z growing up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about us waking up financially, \"Price told USA TODAY. \u201cToday, getting rich is a decision, not a dream. The tools and education are publicly available with no minimum net worth required.\u201d\n\nGen Zers who are still financially dependent on family are also receiving less. The survey found 22% receive $1,000 or more per month, down from 32% a year ago, and 54% receive less than $500 monthly compared to 44% last year.\n\nA separate savings.com report found groceries, cell phone bills, and rent or mortgage payments top the list of costs parents help their adult children cover.\n\nFinancial wellness may be a team sport for Gen Z.\n\nOf those surveyed, 66% said they don\u2019t feel pressure from friends to spend beyond their means. The group values transparency, and 42% don\u2019t mind declining an invite and telling friends they can\u2019t afford an activity.\n\nA majority focused on reducing expenses in the last year, including 41% who cut back on dining out. More than half put money toward savings and 24% paid down debt.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re overall inspired to put themselves on a path to financial independence,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cAs you can imagine, when you\u2019re starting out, things are a little more expensive than you thought.\u201d\n\nAlthough they\u2019re building good habits, a third are still stressed \u2014 52% of whom cite economic instability as a reason why. But that anxiety leads 90% to take action, the survey found. A majority are checking their bank account balance and budgeting. Nearly half are getting ahead on paying bills.\n\nFor some, money stress isn\u2019t motivating. In fact, about a third of Gen Zers surveyed said they\u2019re likely to avoid thinking about money and treat themselves to a purchase when they\u2019re worried about finances.\n\nMore than half buy themselves a small \u201ctreat\u201d at least once a week to celebrate an accomplishment or find a silver lining on a bad day. For 59%, those treat-yourself moments lead to overspending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about the treat itself and more about the lack of boundaries around it,\u201d Price said. \u201cA $7 matcha isn\u2019t going to ruin your financial future, but daily impulse spending without a plan will.\u201d\n\nGen Z lists the high cost of living as a barrier to financial success. Total monthly spending is higher than 35% of Gen Z thought it would be. Specifically, 63% were surprised by the cost of groceries, 47% were caught off guard by rent and utility bills, and 42% were not expecting the high price of dining out.\n\nGen Z also isn\u2019t making as much money as they would like. Over half said they don\u2019t earn enough to live the life they want and 55% don\u2019t have adequate savings to cover three months of expenses.\n\nWhile 42% of Gen Z view saving for retirement and 35% see investing as important steps to financial independence, only a quarter contributed to a retirement account in the last year. One in five invested in the stock market, up slightly from recent years.\n\nThat said, a 2024 Transamerica Institute study found that Gen Z started saving for retirement at the median age of 20. That\u2019s a 15-year head start compared to baby boomers, for whom the median age to begin was 35.\n\nA detailed financial plan can go a long way in relieving money stress.\n\n\u201cFinancial stress can either paralyze you or push you. The key is finding a balance,\u201d Price told USA TODAY. \u201cFor Gen Z, it\u2019s about building systems that run in the background.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where Price\u2019s \u201cRich Routine\u201d comes in. She recommends automating savings, contributing to investments, and splitting paychecks across fixed bills, flexible spending, and future goals.\n\nO\u2019Neill recommends the 50/30/20 budgeting method, stacking up emergency cash, and limiting impulse purchases.\n\n\u201cWhen your money has a plan, you don\u2019t have to think about it 24/7,\u201d Price added.\n\nWhen expenses feel unmanageable, Price says, income is how people can take back control. She recommends pursuing a side hustle to create some financial breathing room and preparing for a raise, not waiting for one.\n\n\u201cTrack your wins at work, quantify your impact, and practice negotiating,\u201d she said. \u201cExplore roles or industries with growth potential. Sometimes the real unlock is making a strategic pivot.\u201d\n\nReach Rachel Barber atrbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X@rachelbarber_",

      "text": "Gen Z shoppers aren't looking for the cheapest price. What is important to them?\nWhen Noor Hasan was a teen shopper, she was highly influenced by trends and bought a lot of cheap clothes from fast-fashion brands.\nBut Hasan's shopping habits have shifted as she has gotten older, and the 23-year old now is deliberate about where she shops and whether that brand or retailer aligns with her ethical and political beliefs.\nMore shoppers \u2013 and Gen Z shoppers in particular \u2013 say they are also doing more mindful, purpose-driven shopping, or what Lightspeed Commerce calls \"valuespending.\"\nWhat is valuespending?\nIn a survey of 2,000 consumers ages 18 and up in the United States and Canada, 92% of all respondents consider themselves somewhat intentional with their purchases, and 40% say they're very intentional.\n\u201cConsumers today are balancing cost with conscience,\u201d Dax Dasilva, CEO and founder of Lightspeed, a point-of-sale commerce platform that serves a variety of retail and hospitality clients, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not always about the lowest price \u2212 it\u2019s about choosing brands that reflect their values. And when those values align, loyalty can follow more easily. This new era of intentional spending \u2212 valuespending \u2212 is reshaping retail and pushing businesses to be more transparent and authentic.\u201d\nSurvey respondents said price (78%) and quality (67%) remain key priorities, but more shoppers (62%) said it was important that their purchases align with their personal values or identity.\nAdditionally:\n- 27% have made purchases based on national pride.\n- 18% supported brands for charitable or social causes.\n- 18% chose products for their sustainability.\n- 15% factored in a CEO\u2019s political alignment.\nGen Z shoppers leading trend of socially conscious shopping\nAs Gen Z shoppers have come of age and with it their buying power, there has been a shift in how and from whom they are buying, Dasilva said.\n\"They're the trendsetters. ... They've come into target as the consumer that everybody wants to sell to,\" he told USA TODAY.\nHasan, who lives in Los Angeles and will be entering law school in the fall, said she shifted her spending habits as she became more financially independent.\nNow, instead of looking for the cheapest fashion finds, for instance, Hasan said she is willing to spend more on clothing from brands that she knows pays fairer wages to their workers.\nShe is not spending more overall but is adjusting her shopping budget to buy less, because she acknowledges she often has to pay more for brands she believes in.\n\"I'm paying more and getting less of it, which I think is an ethical exchange I'm willing to make as a consumer,\" she said.\nHasan, a Palestinian American, also said she will support companies that align with her political beliefs and boycott those that don't. She has joined boycotts against companies that have not shown support for Palestinians.\nGen Z shoppers fear being judged or canceled\nIn the Lightspeed Commerce study, nearly 1 in 3 Gen Z respondents (32%) said they feared being judged for buying from the \"wrong\" brands.\nIn the past six months, Gen Z shoppers said they had made buying decisions either to support or avoid brands based on sustainability/environmental impact (37%), localism or national pride (29%) and religious or cultural alignment (26%).\n\"There's that element of peer pressure that we make statements with the things we purchase or the things we wear,\" Dasilva said.\nDasilva said environmentally conscious Gen Z shoppers and others also have helped the rise of pre-owned and vintage shopping.\nThis story has been updated to fix a typo\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "'A part-time job': Americans spend nearly 4 hours a day thinking about money\n- Americans spend nearly four hours a day thinking about their finances, with many experiencing increased financial stress compared to last year.\n- Top financial concerns include bills, inflation, housing costs, and debt, varying by generation.\n- Younger generations, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, spend more time worrying about money and experience more sleep disruption due to financial concerns.\nBetween bills to pay, tariff news and inflation worries, money is living rent-free in Americans\u2019 minds.\nThey\u2019re spending nearly four hours a day on average thinking about it, according to new research from Empower, a financial services company.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a part-time job,\u201d said Rebecca Rickert, head of communications and consumer insights at Empower.\nAt 54%, a little more than half of the 2,206 adults surveyed said they\u2019re thinking about it more than they did last year. In fact, the June survey found 53% of Americans said they\u2019re feeling financial stress \"more acutely than ever,\" including 62% of Gen Xers and 41% of baby boomers.\nWith banking and investment apps a tap away on their phones, 17% of Americans are checking their financial accounts multiple times a day, and 24% check their bank account daily.\nThe high level of surveillance is more common among younger generations: 24% of Gen Zers and 21% of millennials are looking at their accounts several times a day, compared with 10% of baby boomers.\n\u201cPeople are checking their accounts like they check the weather,\u201d Rickert said.\nWhat exactly are Americans thinking about?\nTop of mind for most Americans is, of course, upcoming and due payments \u2013 57% of Americans report they\u2019re thinking about bills.\nInflation and rising prices also are taking up headspace for 51% of Americans. Of those surveyed, 34% are thinking about housing costs, 30% are thinking about debt, 28% are thinking about tariffs, and 24% are thinking about retirement savings.\n\u201cPeople are carrying more financial pressure as they face external factors that are beyond their control, like market uncertainty, while managing multiple priorities like debt, everyday expenses, and savings \u2013 even if their income hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Lisa Frison, head of financial inclusion at Citi, told USA TODAY.\nChief worries for younger generations are housing costs, job security and debt, Rickert said. Meanwhile, older generations are thinking about retirement savings and reserves, like their emergency cash.\nYounger Americans spend more time worrying\nTime spent thinking about money varies by generation, and it appears to decline as Americans grow older.\nGen Z spends the most time thinking about money, averaging 4.82 hours a day. Millennials follow close behind, averaging 4.73 hours a day. Money still weighs heavily on Gen Xers\u2019 and baby boomers\u2019 minds, but they aren\u2019t thinking as much about it: They average 3.74 hours and 2.4 hours a day, respectively.\nJack Howard, head of financial wellness at Ally Financial, said Gen Zers are unique because they grew up having more information at their fingertips thanks to the internet and are \u201ccomparing themselves against the world\u201d thanks to social media.\n\"Which is good because we want you to get the information and use it. But I wonder if it\u2019s also creating an overload of anxiety,\u201d Howard said. \u201cSocial media creates some level of competition.\u201d\nWhen are Americans thinking about money?\nThe topic is so stressful that 36% of Americans report losing sleep over their financial worries. Millennials may be getting the least rest: 44% report that money worries are keeping them up. Baby boomers are faring better at night; only 24% report it affects their sleep.\nMoney concerns don\u2019t stop during the day. The survey found that 38% of respondents said financial worries interfered with their ability to focus and put a strain on their relationships.\nGen Zers are most likely to think about money between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., while millennials and Gen Xers are often worrying about their finances before bed, between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.\nIs money stress motivating?\nClose to half of Americans report that thinking about money helps them take action to reach their long-term goals, and 47% said they feel confident they\u2019ll reach them.\nAnother 30% reported feeling neutral, or on the fence, about whether they\u2019ll reach their long-term goals. In the meantime, many Americans are seeking financial advice and information.\nMore than half reported following financial news to stay informed, commonly researching topics including inflation, budgeting and saving. A third said talking with a financial adviser helps clarify their financial goals.\nStill, Frison cautions people against ruminating over their finances and thinking too much about past mistakes or missed opportunities, which can lead to frustration but not solutions.\n\u201cIt's unhelpful when thinking about money becomes an infinite loop, so the key is to shift from stress to structure, even with one small move,\u201d Frison told USA TODAY.\nWhat helps ease financial pressure\nAsked what would ease their money worries, nearly half of the survey respondents said a higher income, and 45% said lower living expenses.\nBut 29% also wished for \u201cbroader economic improvements,\u201d and 28% pointed to debt elimination. Nearly a quarter said a larger emergency fund would help, and 18% said a detailed financial plan would have a positive impact.\nSuppose money is taking up more mental headspace than you'd like. In that case, Frison recommends doing a personal financial audit, building small habits over time, and asking friends, family or a professional for help.\n\u201cWhen people are in a silo on these things, it makes it difficult to take action,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the shame comes in.\u201d\nShe and Rickert emphasized the importance of people shifting from passive worrying to taking action \u2013 whether that\u2019s starting to pay down debt or contributing to a 401(k) \u2013 to better their financial situation and relieve stress.\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_"

She packs a Victoria\u2019s Secret tote bag with a straightener, makeup and the office shoes and scrubs she\u2019ll need for her dental receptionist job later that day. It\u2019s a 15 minute drive to the Dunkin' Donuts where she works the opening shift.\nThen, she hits \u201crecord.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning guys, happy Monday,\u201d she says to her 113,000 followers, car keys clinking in the background as she walks up to the location. \u201cCome to work with me as a 25-year-old working two jobs plus owning a small cleaning company.\u201d\nGen Z employees are increasingly choosing to take on multiple jobs or side gigs, often driven by economic necessity. Creators like Dionicio are going a step further, posting about their side hustles on TikTok to make additional cash \u2212 and connect with other young people in the process.\nThese creators use the social media platform \"to validate their lived experience and find solidarity in what can feel like a relentless economic system,\u201d says financial therapist Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, who authored the workbook \u201cThe Financial Anxiety Solution.\u201d \u201dI see them as a version of saying, \u2018This is my reality.

Many are saddled with student loans and entering a slowing U.S. labor market amid skyrocketing costs of living. They say they feel less confident about reaching financial milestones like owning a home.\n\u201cWe don't want to live at work and that shouldn't be the norm to buy a house or get by,\u201d says 22-year-old Kahvon Frank-Morrell, who works at Walmart and as a custodian. \u201cI don't think that everyone should have to be required to do two jobs to get ahead or to live a basic life.\u201d\n'A constant fatigue'\nFrank-Morrell is aiming to save enough to buy a house by 24. He leaves the house at 9 a.m. each morning and at times doesn't get back home until 5 a.m. the next day \u2212 sometimes only sleeping between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. following his two shifts of work.\n\u201cIt feels like a constant fatigue,\u201d Frank-Morrell says. \u201cBut overall, when you see that paycheck, it tends to be worth it.\u201d\nToronto-based 26-year-old Jane Tsang works two full time jobs as a marketing specialist and call center employee. After her second full-time internship in college, she realized she didn\u2019t enjoy working in a corporate environment and started prioritizing ways to retire early.\n\u201cIt just hit me, I cannot do this for the next 45 years,\u201d Tsang says. \u201cA lot of young people are looking for more flexibility and freedom and independence.\u201d\nShe\u2019s worked more than one job for five years and says there are days she goes without moving or seeing the sun. She started experiencing intense headaches in 2022, resulting in multiple doctors appointments and an MRI. It wasn\u2019t until her headache immediately went away on a cruise in winter of 2022 that she realized it was stress-related.\n\u201cWhen I did do exercise and did see the sun, I would have to sacrifice my sleep for it,\u201d Tsang says. \u201cMy health was severely impacted.\u201d\nMonetizing a side hustle on TikTok\nIn June of 2023, Frank-Morrell made a TikTok account to post videos like \u201cWorking 2 jobs in an attempt to save $60,000\u201d and \u201cDay in the life working 2 jobs,\u201d some of which have reached more than 10 million views and can be monetized through TikTok\u2019s Creator Rewards Program.\n\u201cGet ready with me\u201d and \u201cDay in the life\u201d formats have become popular styles in the influencer economy, which the consulting firm McKinsey values at more than $21 billion.\nWhen the comment sections on users\u2019 confession videos are filled with support, it can build a sense of solidarity and peer connection. But the influx in videos can also contribute to unhealthy comparison about one\u2019s economic situation, or glamorize an unrealistic work schedule, according to financial therapist Nate Astle.\n\u201cHustle culture has always been a thing, but I think it's been romanticized more because of things like social media,\u201d Astle says.\nTsang uses her platform to advocate for Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE), a movement that prioritizes intense saving and budgeting to retire before the age of 65. She started posting about her lifestyle to fill what she saw as a void of content from young people her age who were anti-work.\n\u201cI just needed a platform, an outlet to vent to, and I felt like some people related,\u201d Tsang says.\nGen Z increasingly anxious about their financial situation\nTsang says people her age feel \u201cjaded\u201d and \u201cresentful\u201d at the combination of modern work culture and increasing economic instability, leading to nihilism or an anti-career mentality.\n\u201cPeople feel like they're trading in 40 hours a week, but it's no longer able to feed a family, it's no longer able to afford a house,\u201d Tsang says.\nBryan-Podvin says the videos highlight how some young people are intentionally opting out of higher education and the associated student loan debt by working jobs with manual labor. She pointed out that much of Gen Z came of age watching their families navigate the 2008 recession, and then graduated or went through developmental years during a pandemic.\n\u201cGen Z is starting their financial lives with more debt, fewer social safety nets and higher costs across the board. Where millennials were told a version of, \u2018just get a degree and you\u2019ll be fine,\u2019 Gen Z wasn\u2019t given that same message,\u201d Bryan-Podvin says.\nCost of living is frequently cited as a top financial concern among young people. Nearly a third of Gen Z and millennials worry their finances could lead them to experience homelessness, and they are almost three times more likely than older respondents to feel that way, according to a 2024 survey conducted by Acorns and Opinium Research.\nLife events like watching a parent lose a job in childhood, experiencing economic instability during a recession, or having a failed business can also contribute to anxiety about finances, according to Astle.\n\"Gen Z is seeing massive wealth inequality. And wealth inequality has always been a thing, but it truly is at a level not seen before in the last 100 years,\u201d Astle says. \u201cA lot of Gen Z are experiencing the anxiety of\u2026 'I don't actually know if my needs are going to be met.'\"\nIf there ever is a time to have a side hustle, \u201cit\u2019s when you\u2019re young,\u201d says President of the Kahler Financial Group and financial therapist Rick Kahler. A second job can insulate you from losing a job, help fund a retirement plan, or potentially serve as a creative outlet, according to Kahler and Bryan-Podvin. Building good financial habits and investing early compounds interest over decades, setting one up for retirement.\n\u201cIf you've come out of college and you're used to the ramen noodle diet, keep that going and, and save that money,\u201d Kahler says.\nDionicio, who has more than 113,000 followers, says it\u2019s been inspiring to see how many people relate to having two jobs.\n\u201cAt first I was a little shy with the camera, but then I would see other people post about their daily lives, and I'm like, \u2018You know what? Let me do mine,\u201d Dionicio said.\nThe positive reception she receives in her comment section encourages her to keep going. \u201cHow do you have the energy for two jobs plus your own business plus content creation AND you\u2019re a mom!! Superwoman,\u201d one person commented. \u201cYou go girl!\u201d said another.\nRachel Hale\u2019s role covering Youth Mental Health at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal Ventures and Journalism Funding Partners.

Facing this, nearly three quarters of them are taking action to improve their financial health, according to Bank of America\u2019s 2025 Better Money Habits\u00ae financial education study (PDF), published today.\n\u201cGen Z is challenging the stereotype when it comes to young people and their finances,\u201d said Holly O\u2019Neill, president of Consumer, Retail and Preferred Banking at Bank of America. \u201cEven though they\u2019re facing economic barriers and high everyday costs, they are working hard to become financially independent and take control of their money.\u201d\nKey findings from the study include:\nAccording to the study, about half (51%) of Gen Z surveyed say the high cost of living is a barrier to financial success. Total monthly spending is higher than they thought it would be for 35%, especially for everyday expenses including groceries (63%), rent and utilities (47%) and dining out (42%).\nThe study found that Gen Z feel a lack of income is a problem as well, with over half (53%) not feeling they make enough money to live the life they want, and many are struggling to save consistently. In fact, 55% don\u2019t have enough emergency savings to cover three months of expenses.\nWhile Gen Z knows that saving for the future is important, they struggle to do so, with close to half (43%) saying they are not on track to actively save for retirement in the next five years, though they\u2019d like to be.

      "text": "Is your student loan payment increasing? What to know about SAVE plan updates\nMillions of student loan borrowers who were enrolled in a Biden-era repayment plan will soon see their monthly payments increase after the current administration restarted interest accrual Aug. 1.\nNearly 8 million borrowers on the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan are now collecting interest on their loans for the first time since former President Joe Biden placed the group in forbearance in July 2024, pausing both monthly payments and interest accrual.\n\"Borrowers in the SAVE Plan will see their loan balances grow when interest starts accruing on August 1,\" the Department of Education said in its July 9 announcement of the changes. \"When the SAVE Plan forbearance ends, borrowers will be responsible for making monthly payments that include any accrued interest as well as their principal amounts.\"\nSAVE plan borrowers will begin seeing interest accrue on their loans after more than a year of relief, but they remain in general forbearance for their minimum monthly payments. However, payments on interest alone could cost the typical borrower hundreds of dollars per month, according to a recent analysis from the Student Borrower Protection Center, a debt-focused advocacy group.\nThe Department said the move is part of an effort to comply with an injunction issued in April to implement a court order striking down SAVE, however, the rulings they cited do not specifically call the interest-free forbearance illegal.\nHere's what to know:\nWhat is the SAVE plan?\nThat program, launched in 2023 by the Biden administration, was designed to provide more generous terms than prior income-based repayment plans, with monthly payments dropping to as low as $0 for some borrowers.\nIt also provided debt forgiveness for some smaller loans in as few as 10 years, compared to the 20- or 25-year timeline under earlier rules. But the program was quickly challenged in court, caught up in a string of rulings over the administration\u2019s student debt relief plan. In 2024, two courts issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively blocking it, leading the Biden administration to place SAVE plan borrowers into an interest-free forbearance as its legal fights continued.\nLike several other student loan programs, the SAVE plan has come under fire from President Donald Trump's Department of Education as it began to aggressively overhaul the federal student loan system and institute aggressive collection policies.\nThe Department said it began direct outreach to the millions of SAVE plan borrowers in early July about the resumption of interest charges, including instructions on how to move to what it calls a \"legal repayment plan.\"\nHow much will payments increase?\nFor the typical borrower on the plan, the resumption of interest charges could cost them about $300 per month, according to a July analysis from the debt-focused advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center. That amounts to more than $3,500 in interest costs annually.\nThe center said it estimates more than 40% of borrowers in the SAVE plan make less than 225% of the federal poverty line, which it calculated to be $35,213 per year for single borrowers and up to $72,338 for borrowers heading a household of four.\nBorrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the loan simulator on the Federal Student Aid website.\nWhat is the Repayment Assistance Plan?\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon urged SAVE borrowers to transition quickly to alternate repayment plans.\n\"For years, the Biden administration used so-called \u2018loan forgiveness\u2019 promises to win votes, but federal courts repeatedly ruled that those actions were unlawful,\" she said in a statement on July 9. \"Congress designed these programs to ensure that borrowers repay their loans, yet the Biden administration tried to illegally force taxpayers to foot the bill instead.\"\nMcMahon said the department urges all borrowers in the SAVE plan to transition to what she calls \"legally compliant\" repayment plans, pointing to the administration's proposed Repayment Assistance Plan, RAP, slated to replace the existing Income-Based Repayment Plan in 2026.\nSAVE based monthly payments, which could be as low as $0, on discretionary income. In comparison, RAP bases payments on gross income and requires all borrowers, even those who report no income, to make minimum monthly payments of at least $10.\nThe new plan was part of a series of student loan changes included in Trump's massive tax and spending bill, signed into law on July 4. Most of the overhauls take effect July 1, 2026, and include new limits on the amount that students and their families can borrow and new eligibility criteria for Pell Grants, which help low-income undergraduate students.\nThis story was updated to clarify a reference to SAVE plan borrowers' forbearance status.\nContributing: Reuters; Zachary Schermele, USA TODAY.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Tough job market? Gen Z responds with gig work and entrepreneurship\nThe class of 2025 entered a tough job market this summer, but some members of Generation Z are adapting.\nFor some young Americans, a majority of whom are entrepreneurial-minded and believe traditional 9-to-5 schedules are \u201coutdated,\u201d unconventional work is a solution to getting ghosted by employers. Some pick up multiple jobs and record their day-to-day for TikTok, hoping to monetize their routines further. Others turn to platforms that help them get gig work like Thumbtack, Fiverr or Taskrabbit.\n\u201cI literally applied to like 85 actual 9-to-5s in all different types of industries,\u201d said Nola Rodgers, 22. \u201cNone of them came through. Taskrabbit had the only people who actually responded to me.\u201d\nThe platform saw a 25% increase in sign-ups in July, said Christopher Ager, Taskrabbit\u2019s chief commercial officer. Though some users view these platforms as a way to earn some extra cash on the weekend, Rodgers and others are using them as a launch pad into entrepreneurship and a way to escape the 9-to-5 rat race.\n\u201cYoung adults are rewriting the rules of work and embracing side hustles as a sustainable, empowering alternative,\u201d Ager told USA TODAY.\nHow bad is the job market?\nAt the start of this year, 1 in 5 working professionals who were looking for a job in 2024 were still searching, and 28% of people said the market was so bad they weren\u2019t planning to look for one in 2025, according to LinkedIn research.\nNot everyone has the luxury of staying put, particularly if they never had full-time work to begin with. Nearly two-thirds of Gen Z said they were likely to search for a new job in 2025, according to a Bankrate job seeker survey.\nThe Labor Department\u2019s April jobs report showed 1.7 million Americans have been out of work six months or longer, the most in more than two years. Hiring unexpectedly picked up in June as employers added 147,000 jobs, but only 74,000 of those were added in the private sector. State and local government hiring accounted for much of the rest.\nGen Z's entrepreneur mindset\nRodgers isn't too concerned with who is hiring.\nShe joined Taskrabbit in 2021 and has made $180,000 since she started assembling furniture, mounting TVs and organizing people\u2019s homes. In 2022, she launched her own website offering similar services.\nThis year, she said that each month before taxes she\u2019s bringing home $3,000 to $3,500 through Taskrabbit and about $2,000 through her small business.\nWithout a college degree, student loans or a boss, Rodgers has no regrets about taking an unconventional path compared with that of her peers.\n\u201cI've been in the workforce 4\u00bd years more than them. They\u2019re just now trying to find jobs because they went to college, and I already have an established business,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cSo, I would say it worked out.\u201d\nWithin the next five years, Rodgers wants to start making custom furniture to expand her business. And she\u2019s not alone. A 2020 WP Engine survey found 62% of Gen Zers planned to start or possibly start their own business.\n'I don't want anyone to tell me how to do my job'\nKevin Johnson, 24, is among them. Like Rodgers, he started on Taskrabbit in 2019, mainly helping people move. Today, he said, he makes $2,500 to $4,000 a month before taxes.\nIt was enough for him to purchase a pickup in cash. He has two goals in mind after he wraps up his associate degree: saving for a down payment for a home and opening his own auto shop.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you need a 9-to-5 to be stable,\u201d Johnson said.\nThe Class of 2025 agrees. Monster\u2019s State of the Graduate Report released earlier this year found 67% think a 9-to-5 schedule is outdated and 64% think the five-day workweek is antiquated. More than half said working full time in an office and the concept of having to relocate for a job are also outdated, the report found.\nJohnson prefers working for himself, anyway: \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to tell me how to do my job.\u201d\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_"

      "text": "Groceries, phone bills, rent? Where parents still help adult kids financially\nWhen Kaylynn St. Peters turned 27, she got a job doing entertainment booking, but her excitement took a slight hit when her dad saw it as a sign it was time for her to start paying her own phone bill.\n\u201cI was kind of riding that high until they kicked me off,\u201d St. Peters said.\nWhile some may believe your late 20's is a tardy start to taking on such a task, on average, people start paying for their own cell line at age 27, a responsibility 76% of Americans consider one of the ultimate signs of adulthood, according to a new AT&T survey. Still, 32% of people don\u2019t start paying their own cell phone bill until they are 30 or older and 18% don\u2019t take it on until after they\u2019ve turned 40.\nWhen St. Peters went to get her own plan, she was quoted around $70 a month from T-Mobile and Verizon. To her, that was \u201ckind of crazy\u201d so she joined her brother-in-law's plan instead and now sends him about $40 a month through Venmo.\nSome 46% of people do something similar, according to the survey. Erin Scarborough, AT&T's President of Broadband and Connectivity Initiatives said that's a reason why the company introduced SplitPay, which allows multiple people to pay their portion of a wireless bill without needing to use a third-party payment method.\nScarborough said the amount of people delaying paying their own bill is \u201cabsolutely growing\u201d and is just one part of young people\u2019s rising financial reliance on their parents well into their adult years.\n\u201cI think that has definitely been going up year over year over year,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cThat has become prevalent in multiple other places, not just cell phone bills ... That was not the case 20 years ago.\u201d\nMany of those polled by AT&T think she's right. Some 70% of survey respondents said they believe most Americans have access to at least one subscription service account they don\u2019t pay for \u2013 something Netflix appears to be addressing with its crackdown on password sharing.\nBetween inflation fears and rising costs, times are tough. For many Americans, turning to the bank of mom and dad is a solution.\nHow many adults are receiving money from their parents?\nHalf of parents with adult children regularly send them money or help them financially, a savings.com survey found earlier this year.\nThe average amount these parents give reached a three-year high of $1,474 per month, up 6% from last year, according to the survey.\nAdult members of Gen Z, or those between the ages of 18 and 28, receive more from their parents than Millennials, or those between 29 and 44.\nOf those who get money from their parents, the average amount Gen Z receives in 2025 is $1,813 per month while the average amount for Millennials is $863.\nMuch of that money comes with strings attached. The survey found 77% of parents put conditions on their financial support.\nWhat things do adult children need help affording?\nGroceries, cell phone bills, and rent or mortgage payments top the list of costs parents help their adult children cover in 2025.\nEach month, 83% of supportive parents give their kids an average of $220 to help afford groceries, 65% pay an average of $63 for their child\u2019s cell phone, and 63% cover an average of $653 of their kids\u2019 rent or mortgage, according to the savings.com survey.\nAt 54%, most parents offering support also help their adult children pay for health insurance and healthcare.\nThe most costly monthly expense for 45% of parents supporting adult children is tuition or other school-related expenses, with parents spending an average of $1,198 per month.\nA minority of supportive parents also help their adult children invest, cover car payments, vacations, and student loan or credit card payments.\nFinancial dependence in adulthood can create tension\nThat support can cost parents more than some of their paychecks. Close to half of survey respondents said they had sacrificed their financial security to help their grown kids and working parents who support their adult children reported they give them more than double the amount they contribute to their retirement accounts.\nThis can create tension. Jack Howard, head of money wellness at Ally Financial, said it\u2019s something parents bring up in the financial wellness and education workshops she leads.\nHoward gave the example of one mom who joined the workshop with her son and said she had a problem with the fact that she was still paying his phone bill. Howard said the son didn\u2019t know his mom had an issue with it and immediately offered to start covering it himself.\nTo avoid an uncomfortable parent-child relationship, Howard suggests having financial conversations early and often, though she acknowledged that can be difficult for parents who grew up in families that avoided the subject.\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that in a lot of our classes. \u2018We didn\u2019t talk about money. It was taboo. It was seen as disrespectful.\u2019 But now with social media, when you think of Gen Z, there\u2019s so much access to information and transparency that they expect that from (their parents),\u201d Howard said.\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_"

      "text": "Gen Z\u2019s blank stare is the internet\u2019s latest obsession\nEver received an awkward response to a \u201cHi how are you?\u201d from a younger neighbor or a deer in the headlights look from a teenage customer service worker?\nTikTokers say there\u2019s a name for that \u2014 the \u201cGen Z stare.\u201d\nUsers on the platform say it refers to the vacant stare young people might give in response to small talk, simple customer service questions or workplace inquiries. Hypothetical skits on the platform mocking Gen Z responses are going viral.\nIt\u2019s sparking a broader conversation about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, chronic technology use, and if Gen Z (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) lacks communication skills in the workplace and social settings.\nWhat is the Gen Z stare?\nThe Gen Z stare is a term used to refer to the blank, expressionless look some say is characteristic of young people\u2019s interactions. It might manifest as an awkward encounter with a barista or a lack of verbal response from a coworker.\nMost of the viral skits portray the stare in customer service interactions, where a Gen Z cashier or customer responds with a blank, wordless stare where small talk would usually fill the void, sometimes as a result of a senseless questions.\n\"It\u2019s literally just exhausted teenagers working part time trying to put up with school while paying bills,\u201d one person commented under a skit with 2.3 million views from TikToker Mark Gaetano, known on the platform as Snarky Marky. \u201cThe Gen Z stare is usually just us being in complete disbelief of what we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d says another.\nBut commenters from other generations argued back that the stare goes beyond the typical customer service blank face.\n\u201cWe're talking about the stare when anyone tries to have just a normal human interaction with you, like in the flesh, and you guys freeze,\u201d one TikToker posted, \"I can't even count to you how many times I've tried to say hi to neighbors walking by that are like in their teens and they just look at you like they just saw a ghost.\"\nSocial skills shaped by 24/7 technology and the pandemic\nThe videos have sparked intergenerational discourse. Some Gen Zers defended the stare as a response to illogical questions from customers, while others acknowledged it as a reflection of anxiety in social interactions.\nAnd it's possible the stare is the result of Gen Z\u2019s social development being hindered during the pandemic. Online school and social distancing during lockdowns influenced how people of all ages navigated in-person interactions and awkward social situations.\nPlus, nearly half of teens say they\u2019re online constantly, according to 2024 data from the Pew Research Center.\nGen Z, nicknamed \u201cthe anxious generation\u201d by social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, is more anxious and isolated than older generations. Former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy sounded the alarm on loneliness during his term, explaining in a report that young adults are almost twice as likely to report feeling lonely than those older than 65.\nThere are jokes about every generation\u2019s communication skills, from jabs about the millennial pause to boomers\u2019 struggles to understand emojis. Whether it\u2019s rooted in pandemic-induced social anxiety or changing workplace norms, it\u2019s a sign of how young people are engaging with the world around them.\nRachel Hale\u2019s role covering Youth Mental Health at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal Ventures and Journalism Funding Partners.

      "text": "As millions miss student loan payments, here's how it could hurt the economy\nAfter a roughly five-year hiatus, student loan borrowers are once again seeing their credit scores plunge if they fall behind on payments. Economists say it could be bad news for borrowers and the economy at large.\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found the delinquency rate for student loans surged from less than 1% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to nearly 8% in the first quarter of this year as a pause on reporting delinquent loans ended. That has sent some credit scores into a free fall, which makes it more difficult for borrowers to secure affordable loans or pull off major purchases.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York said more than 2.2 million newly delinquent student loan borrowers\u2019 credit scores plunged more than 100 points. More than 1 million had scores drop at least 150 points.\n\"We could see millions of borrowers potentially locked out of the conventional mortgage market. They could see the cost of a car loan double, they could find it harder to find rental housing,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group focused on alleviating student loan debt. \"The immediate harm, but also the long-term harm, is just massive.\"\nWhy are student loan delinquencies on the rise?\nThe federal government\u2019s pandemic-era student loan payment pause lifted in September 2023, but it wasn\u2019t until fall 2024 that payments at least 90 days past due could be reported to credit bureaus. Those delinquencies started appearing on credit reports in 2025.\nAs of the first quarter, nearly 1 in 4 student loan borrowers required to make payments were behind on their loans, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nMuch of that surge could be driven by confusion around loan payments restarting, according to Beth Akers, a senior fellow who focuses on the economics of higher education at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.\nThe pause \u2013 which began under President Donald Trump's first administration \u2013 was extended multiple times under President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, online rumors claimed all student loans had been permanently canceled under Biden. Biden did attempt to forgive $400 billion in student debt, but the plan was ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\u201cFor a long time, I think borrowers thought their loans were canceled. Or that they'd never have to repay them. And I don\u2019t blame anyone for believing that,\u201d Akers said. \u201cWe really confused the heck out of borrowers.\u201d\nOther borrowers may not be financially prepared to pay back their loans, especially after falling out of habit with their monthly payments.\n\"The economy is very different than it was pre-COVID,\" said Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit based in Plymouth, Massachusetts. \"Things like housing and eggs and lettuce cost a lot more than they did prior to COVID. So a payment that might have been affordable in 2020 might not be affordable now.\"\nA paper co-written by Michael Dinerstein, an associate professor of economics at Duke University in North Carolina, found the student loan pause allowed borrowers to take on other forms of debt, such as mortgages, credit card loans and auto loans. Now those borrowers are also on the hook for student loan payments that can cost hundreds, if not thousands, each month.\nAnother possible factor? This year's surge may be tied to an influx of late payments that would have been spread out across multiple years without the pause, according to Kristin Blagg, principal research associate in the Work, Education, and Labor Division at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.\n\"In an average year, about a million people enter default,\" Blagg said. \"And what we\u2019ve had is almost five years of students not getting to that default period. So you can think of this being almost a buildup of folks who would have defaulted during that time who are just now reaching that point.\"\nAbout 5.6 million borrowers were considered newly delinquent in the first quarter of 2025. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated in March that more than 9 million student loan borrowers will face significant credit score decreases by the end of June.\nWhat does this mean for borrowers?\nReese Wallace, 34 of Oakland, California, watched his credit score plunge from above 700 to 488 this year after he stopped paying his student loans.\nA 2023 graduate from the California College of the Arts, Wallace left school with roughly $50,000 in student debt. Payments were nearly $500 a month, which Wallace said was untenable on a studio artist wage in the Bay Area.\nWallace said he quit paying his loans last year to put the money toward graduate school applications, under the impression that his loans would be automatically deferred as he applied. He realized that wasn't true when his application for student housing at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was rejected because of his low credit score.\nThe credit score has thrown a wrench in Wallace\u2019s plans to move for graduate school. He had to get a co-signer for housing, and he worries he'll have trouble affording a car after years of traveling with public transportation in California.\n\"What kind of vehicle can I get with a 488 credit score?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly going to be really, really difficult.\u201d\nAkers believes resuming student loan payments is fair to taxpayers but said there can be \u201cserious trickle-down implications\u201d when credit scores take a hit, especially since the baseline interest rate is already high.\n\u201cPeople are quick to think about the ability to finance the purchase of a new home at an affordable interest rate,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also employers look at credit scores sometimes. When you\u2019re renting a home, they look at your credit score.\u201d\nBorrowers could find themselves in more hot water if they continue to miss payments. After 270 days, the government can seize wages, tax returns or Social Security benefits. The Office of Federal Student Aid is expected to send notices on wage garnishments this summer.\nWhat does this mean for the economy?\nEconomists warn restarted payments and sinking credit scores could deliver another hit to an economy that has already shown signs of slowing this year.\n\u201cIt's another potential drag,\u201d Blagg said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a good sense of how big it is compared to all the other things that are going on in the moment, but anytime there's a dollar spent servicing loans, it\u2019s a dollar that\u2019s not being put into the economy or saved for a big purchase.\"\nMorgan Stanley economists estimate increased loan payments could lower real GDP growth by up to 0.15 percentage points this year as payments increase by $1 billion to $3 billion a month. Their May 5 report says the GDP impact is \"relatively small\" but describes it as \"another headwind\" for consumers.\nTips for borrowers\nCanchola Ba\u00f1ez from the Student Borrower Protection Center shared advice for borrowers who are delinquent on their loans:\n- Borrowers should explore repayment options at Studentaid.gov. Canchola Ba\u00f1ez said income-driven repayment plans are likely their best option. This shift could take time; there's a backlog of roughly 2 million federal student loan borrowers requesting income-driven repayment plans, according to figures from the Education Department. Borrowers can be in forbearance while their application is processing, which means they won't have to make their loan payments while they're waiting for approval on a more affordable payment plan.\nIf a borrower is more than 270 days behind on their loan, the Education Department lays out three options to get out of default:\n- Repay the loan in full (not practical for most borrowers).\n- Look into loan rehabilitation. Borrowers can contact the loan holder and agree in writing to make nine affordable monthly payments within 20 days of a set due date, all within 10 consecutive months.\n- Explore loan consolidation. Borrowers agree to repay a new \"Direct Consolidation Loan\" under an income-driven repayment plan or make three full consecutive voluntary on-time monthly payments on the defaulted loan before it is consolidated. Though this option is faster, accrued interest is added to the principal balance, which could have borrowers paying more overall."

      "text": "New grads want remote, high-paying jobs that align with their values. Is that possible?\nLike many 2025 college graduates, Jayda Hurtado is hoping to land a dream job soon but is quickly learning the challenges involved with entering today\u2019s job market.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually terrified. I probably have a good cry session about it maybe every two weeks,\u201d Hurtado said.\nShe\u2019s applied to jobs but hasn\u2019t landed an interview yet. She plans to keep searching over the next month and hopes to have something in place before graduation.\n\u201cIf not, then it\u2019s a matter of having something to get me by before I get a big girl job,\u201d Hurtado said. \u201cI also know the economy is in a weird place.\u201d\nOverall, 2025 graduates are confident they will find a job. Monster\u2019s 2025 State of the Graduate Report found 83% think it\u2019ll happen shortly after graduation, with 37% predicting it\u2019ll happen within four to six months. Only 5% said they think it\u2019ll take them a year or longer to secure a job.\nMost graduates feel confident their skills match those required for entry-level roles, and 20% reported feeling overqualified for an entry-level position.\nHurtado majored in advertising and earned a certificate in music business during her time at the University of Georgia. She currently works as a server and bartender but dreams of doing marketing for a record label or something similar. But she said she\u2019s realistic and that\u2019s why she\u2019s also applying for standard advertising jobs as well.\nShe\u2019s not alone. Some 48% of 2025 graduates think they will not be able to find a job at an organization they prefer, according to the report.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard world out there for a lot of people who are not just highly educated, but have built these careers and have a trusted resume of previous experience. It\u2019s hard for them to get a job,\u201d said Emily Levine, executive vice president at recruitment firm Career Group Companies. \u201cIf you want to get a job somewhat quickly and start contributing and earning money, it most likely won\u2019t be your dream job. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d\nWhat 2025 graduates want\nThis year\u2019s college graduates have long wish lists for their future employers.\nThe report found less than two in five graduates said they would be willing to accept working in office, down 7% from 2024. At 42%, a sizable portion said they would never accept a job at a company that doesn\u2019t offer flexible or hybrid work schedules.\n\u201cRemote work or hybrid work is no longer a nice-to-have,\u201d said Vicki Salemi, a career expert at Monster. \u201cFor these grads, it\u2019s a must-have.\u201d\nMost new graduates are also unwilling to work for free, with only 12% saying they\u2019d accept an unpaid internship and 62% reporting the most important aspect of a job is a good salary.\nAside from money, 2025 graduates want a supportive work environment and a team that aligns with their values. Some 91% said it's important they feel comfortable discussing mental wellness at work and 71% said they wouldn\u2019t work for a company that openly supports a political issue or candidate they don\u2019t, up 4% from last year.\nBiggest deal breakers for 2025 graduates\nThis year\u2019s graduates appear to disagree with the conventional wisdom that the first few years of a career should involve paying dues and working overtime to get ahead. At 56%, more than half said they would never accept a job that doesn\u2019t offer work-life balance.\nAnother deal breaker for new graduates is a stagnant workplace. Some 54% said they would never accept a job with an employer that doesn\u2019t offer growth opportunities.\nAt the end of the day, it does come back to money for some survey respondents. Among them, 49% said they would never accept a job that doesn\u2019t come with a competitive salary and benefits, up 5% from last year.\nLevine said getting a job right after graduation can be tricky, as employers sometimes rely on interns during the summer and by the time the internships end, companies enter the fourth quarter when they may have already spent their hiring budget for the year.\n\u201cThen you find yourself in 2026 but you\u2019re a 2025 grad and you still haven\u2019t found a job. That\u2019s usually when these recent college grads become a little bit more flexible or open minded or humble to this process,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThey think about the things that originally they scoffed at.\u201d\nNew grads think traditional work practices are outdated\nNew graduates tend to think a traditional work week is a thing of the past. Some 67% said a \u20189 to 5\u2019 schedule is outdated, up 12% from last year. At 64%, most also think the 5-day work week is antiquated, up 10% from 2024.\nIn general, 59% think working full time in an office and the concept of having to relocate for a job are outdated.\nYounger generations of graduates are also throwing off stigmas around job hopping and pay transparency, Salemi said. She credited young people with pushing employers to include things like salary and remote flexibility in job descriptions even if the law in their states does not require them to.\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at work and saying, \u2018Wait a minute. Previous generations got it wrong and here\u2019s how we can correct it.\u2019 That\u2019s commendable,\u201d Salemi said. \u201cAnd some (older) employees are saying, \u2018Wait a minute.

      "text": "What to prioritize when making a budget? Tips on creating and sticking to one\nBudgets. You know you should have one, but if checking your bank account stresses you out, the idea of tracking your spending can seem like the worst way to spend an afternoon.\nBut, one of the biggest financial mistakes you can make is not monitoring your money, according to Annamaria Lusardi, who heads Stanford's Initiative for Financial Decision-Making.\n\u201cThis is not an unbiased world that we face. Firms spend millions of dollars to make people spend,\u201d Lusardi said. \u201cI tell my students, by the time you leave this classroom, and you go back to your dorm, you\u2019ll have five opportunities to spend. There is nothing, no sign, no advertisement, that says \u2018Please stay within your budget.\u2019\u201d\nYou may think you have a budget. You might have an idea of how much you think you make, spend, and where you should cut back. But financial experts told USA TODAY people generally overestimate their earnings and underestimate their spending.\nTaking the time to determine your exact financial situation and set goals can be an enlightening experience. Yet while \u201chow do I budget\u201d seems like a simple question, knowing exactly where to start can be complicated. Here is a guide to help:\nFigure out where you are now\nFirst, you need to know how much money you make. Look for your take home pay after taxes and deductions for things like a 401(k). If you don\u2019t have a stable income, freelance, or do gig work, take the average of your last several few months of income, and make a reasonable prediction about what you will make knowing what jobs you have lined up.\nIf you\u2019re self-employed, this might also be a good time to think about the amount you\u2019re setting aside for taxes.\n\u201cNobody is withholding money for you, and suddenly it comes to the end of the year and you\u2019re going to owe taxes,\u201d said Tim Rupert, a professor of accounting at Northeastern University. \u201cThat can be a real surprise for people. Oftentimes people think, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t earn that much money,\u2019 so they overestimate what they\u2019re going to get to keep.\u201d\nSecond, you need to know how much money you have to spend. Identify your fixed expenses. These are going to be costs like utility bills or payments for rent, a mortgage, a car, and insurance.\nThird, you should look at where else your money is going and identify your variable expenses. Although groceries are a necessity, for instance, there are ways you can lower those bills. Variable spending also includes things like eating out, shopping, and travel.\nSubtract your fixed and variable expenses from your income. Are you spending less or more than you earn?\nOnce you have a firm grasp on where you are, you can figure out where you want to go.\nSet goals and priorities\nYour goals will depend on your current financial situation. Experts agree that covering bills and making the minimum payment on debts on time are most people\u2019s first priorities. If you\u2019re not doing that, although you may be tired of hearing it, experts suggest looking at ways to increase your income like getting a second job or decreasing your expenses by canceling subscriptions or not getting takeout.\nOnce you\u2019ve got your bills and minimum payments taken care of, you\u2019ll want to tackle high-interest debt, like credit cards, and build a starter emergency fund of a few hundred dollars.\nRay Charles \"Chuck\" Howard, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Virginia, said people should focus on the goal that they are personally most motivated to reach.\n\u201cThe rational response is almost certainly to pay down the debt,\u201d Howard said. \u201cBut you can imagine a circumstance in which you encounter some emergency expense that throws you into even more debt and makes you even more demotivated to improve your financial well-being, so it depends on the person.\u201d\nIf your employer offers a 401(k) match, this is also the time to start thinking about getting some free money. Consider contributing enough to an employer-sponsored retirement account to fully capture the match so you\u2019re not leaving money on the table.\nOnce you\u2019ve paid down toxic debt and have your employer\u2019s 401(k) match, you should continue to build up that starter emergency fund. Conventional wisdom suggests saving three to six months of expenses to prepare for a rainy day and avoid more bad debt.\nNext, budget for goals like a home, vacation or car\nNext, it\u2019s time to pay off debt with lower interest rates like student loans or a mortgage and contribute more to retirement accounts. Then, feel free to invest in yourself. Set savings goals for a new home, car, or a vacation.\nExperts agreed that although this timeline of goals can work for a lot of people, everyone\u2019s circumstances are different.\n\u201cIt has a lot to do with priorities,\u201d Lusardi said. \u201cIf you live in an area where you know you need a car to go to work, or you\u2019re building a family and need the car to bring your child to school... you have to make it a priority.\u201d\nChoose tools to track your progress\nWhile making a budget, you may choose to use a time-tested budgeting strategy that works for you. Popular methods include 50/30/20, paying yourself first, and envelope budgets.\nThe 50/30/20 strategy involves putting 50% of your money toward needs, 20% toward savings, and 30% toward wants. The pay yourself method means that the first \"bill\" you pay when you get your paycheck is a contribution to your savings account. With an envelope budget, you put set amounts of money into different categories like entertainment or shopping, and once it runs out, you can no longer spend in that category.\nRupert said the biggest mistake people make with budgets is not sticking to it once they\u2019ve made one.\n\u201cPeople oftentimes have really good intentions to start,\u201d he said. \u201cFor most of us, it\u2019s not fun sticking to a budget.\u201d\nBut to be successful, you must track your progress, and there are a lot of tools out there to help.\nYou can automate your savings by setting up a split deposit, which is when a portion of your direct deposit goes directly to a savings account before the rest ends up in checking. Another option is to set up automatic transfers from your checking to savings account.\nThe Federal Trade Commission also offers a free monthly budget worksheet online and Google Sheets has free monthly and annual budget templates anyone with a Google account can use. Additionally, there are several apps people can download and use on their phones that help track spending including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard, or Goodbudget.\nHoward said he uses a \u201cgood, old-fashioned\" Excel spreadsheet.\n\u201cThe ease of using an app is a benefit for a lot of people so I don\u2019t want to undersell that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for me personally, if I invest some time and effort into a spreadsheet, I don\u2019t want that to go to waste. So, I end up using it.\u201d\nCelebrate wins, no matter how small\nIn terms of savings goals, Howard determined through his research, that it is sometimes helpful to set optimistic budgets rather than realistic ones.\nHe imagined a scenario in which someone currently spends $1,000 a month at restaurants and sets a goal to spend only $200 the next month. Because that is a \u201creally aggressive\u201d behavior change, he said, most people won\u2019t only spend $200, but they may spend $500 because they set an optimistic goal.\n\u201cA lot of personal finance folks will look at that outcome and say well this is no good, this person overspent their budget,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely a wrong frame of mind to be in. I think that person is a success story because they\u2019re spending $500 less than they used to.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to celebrate wins while budgeting, and those will look different for each person.\nHoward imagines another scenario where someone has $10,000 in credit card debt with a 25% interest rate and a $1,000 loan from the bank with a 9% interest rate.\nHe said although rationally, that person should be paying down the credit card debt, a lot of people would feel more motivated if they first took the $1,000 loan off the books.\n\u201cFinancially, it\u2019s not necessarily the optimal thing to do, but if it makes you happy and then subsequently more motivated to tackle the $10,000 debt with 25% interest. More power to you.\u201d\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_"
