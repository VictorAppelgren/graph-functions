      "feedback": "This draft is anchored on a timely event (the 90-day tariff truce) but the analysis needs a tighter, testable causal chain, a formal 3–4 scenario map with explicit triggers/invalidations, and explicit timing windows to meet the SECTION FOCUS. Actionable edits: reconstruct the piece as a 3–4–branch scenario map (Base, Alt A, Alt B; optionally a Horizon-Outlook) anchored to concrete catalysts and invalidations, with explicit timing buckets (0–45 days, 45–90 days, 90–180 days) and path‑dependency rules. Quantify each branch using numbers drawn from the source: tariff structure (baseline 10%, top line 30%, fentanyl adders; prior peak 145%), the 90‑day pause, the Nvidia/AMD revenue‑sharing condition (15%), and the observed 2.6% S&P futures rally as immediate market signal; use these as inputs to projected price/volatility/capex/flow implications under each scenario. Strengthen the causal chain by naming the transmission channels (policy levers -> export controls and rare-earth magnet/tech flows -> corporate strategy and capex -> asset prices and risk premia), and tie each channel to a concrete data point or event to avoid generic statements. For Base Case, specify a plausible outcome: tariffs stay near 10%/30% with calibrated concessions, keeping supply chains running and supporting modest risk‑on for tech/industrial equities; for Alt A (escalation), spell out a credible tariff jump toward 50% on most products if talks stall, with a regulatory‑policy‑driven squeeze on cross‑border AI/semis flows and a sharper selloff in risk assets; for Alt B (limited extension with partial concessions), keep the 30% top line but document a few carve-outs or staged reductions that would mute volatility yet leave core tensions unresolved. Add explicit invalidation criteria (e.g., failure to reach a substantive deal within the 90‑day window, re‑imposition of higher tariffs beyond 50%, or a countervailing rare-earth/export‑control tightening) and map them to observable signals (USTR/Commerce statements, export licenses for Nvidia/AMD, rare-earth magnet policy shifts, Intel policy interactions). Enrich the horizon with a concise 1–2 sentence macro backdrop (growth/inflation/rate expectations) and a watch list: next negots updates, export-control guidance, rare-earth flow changes, Intel/Nvidia/AMD commentary, and market moves in equities/commodities/currency around key dates. Tighten the prose to remove narrative drift and align every assertion with a single citation tag (D5M2JYKVS) to meet the citation constraint, while reconciling conflicts by noting that the same source presents 10% baseline, 20% fentanyl adders, 30% top line, and 50% as a potential escalation scenario. End with a crisp base case, 1–2 clear alts, the principal risks, watch‑list signals, and a confidence band (mid) for the 3–6 month horizon. (D5M2JYKVS)",
