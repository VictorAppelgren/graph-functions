  "title": "Gotta wear \u2019em all! Uniqlo launches new Pok\u00e9mon TCG-themed clothing line",
  "description": "Uniqlo has launched a limited-run Pok\u00e9mon TCG (and Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket)-inspired lineup of tees and sweatshirts.",
  "content": "Uniqlo is no stranger to video game-themed clothing lineups, and its latest launch is no except. The latest products all hail from the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game and depict your favorite cards, attacks, and more. The designs are available as both tee shirts and sweatshirts (perfect for that upcoming fall weather), but fair warning: lineups like this tend to rotate quickly, so if you see something you have your eye on, don\u2019t wait too long to snatch it up.\n\nFan-favorite designs like Pikachu, Omanyte, Gengar, and Snorlax are all available. Adult prices start at roughly $20 and go up to $40 for sweatshirts. Sizes range from extra small up to XXL, although some designs only extend to a large. The full range of shirts is available to browse on Uniqlo\u2019s website.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lineup for kids, too, if you want to make sure your whole family matches the look.\n\nAll of the clothing items are unisex. The Pikachu design (shown above) is a particular favorite; not only does it have a miniaturized Pok\u00e9dex entry for your favorite electric mouse, but it also has multiple different card designs shown within the silhouette.\n\nUniqlo has featured Pok\u00e9mon designs before, but this is the first time we\u2019ve seen Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket designs included in the mix. The popular mobile trading card game has dominated the charts since its launch late last year and features some of the most unique card art we\u2019ve ever seen. Seriously, Pok\u00e9mon: I would pay money for prints.\n\nPreviously, Uniqlo has launched Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Final Fantasy, and Animal Crossing clothing lines. Most of those aren\u2019t available any longer, but you can still get your hands on its Studio Ghibli lineup if you\u2019re a Totoro fan. The Pok\u00e9mon designs are available now, but it isn\u2019t clear how long they\u2019ll remain on sale.",

Whether or not you\u2019ve already been filling out and completing your collection in the base game, everyone is curious to see what new types, designs, and abilities a new set of Pok\u00e9mon brings to the table. Here are all the brand new Pok\u00e9mon you can find while exploring the Land of Kitakami and their types.\nEvery new Pok\u00e9mon in The Teal Mask\nOgerpon (4 types)\nOgerpon is the newest Legendary to be added to the series, and is by default a Grass type. However, in keeping with the theme of masks, it will change its form and type depending on what mask it is wearing, such as the Wellspring mask, Hearthflame mask, and Cornerstone mask. By default, Ogerpon is wearing the titular Teal mask.\nOkidogi\nThis is a dog-themed Poison and Fighting-type Legendary that is a Hero of Kitakami. This Pok\u00e9mon has no evolutions.\nMunkidori\nThis curious monkey is a Poison and Psychic-type Legendary that also holds the title of Hero of Kitakami. Munkidori has no evolutions.\nFezandipiti\nThe final Hero of Kitakami is Fezandipiti, the Poison and Fairy-type Legendary. As usual, this Legendary can\u2019t evolve.\nDipplin\nA rare Grass and Dragon type, Dipplin is an evolution of Applin.\nPoltchageist\nYou could probably guess Poltchageist was a Grass and Ghost type by its name and design. This Pok\u00e9mon can evolve into Sinistcha using either an Unremarkable Teacup or Masterpiece Teacup.\nSinistcha\nThe evolution of Poltageist we just talked about, Sinistcha remains a Grass and Ghost type."
