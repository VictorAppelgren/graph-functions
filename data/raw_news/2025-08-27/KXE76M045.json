Even if both ends of the payment are in fiat, the settlement can flow through USDC, giving banks a faster, cheaper alternative to the slow and costly correspondent banking chains that dominate international transfers today.\n\u2022 Take a short quiz to get matched with a financial advisor who understands your goals - no pressure, just real support.\n\nFinastra's clients process more than $5T in global transactions every day. By integrating Circle's infrastructure, those payments could settle almost instantly while still meeting compliance and foreign exchange requirements. Our goal is to help banks modernize without forcing them to rip out existing systems, said Finastra CEO Chris Walters. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire added that Finastra's reach makes it an ideal partner to scale USDC's role in global money movement.\n\nFor Circle, the tie-up is another step toward embedding USDC into mainstream financial railsa push that could broaden adoption far beyond crypto-native platforms.",

      "text": "Finastra, a major player in financial services software, has partnered with Circle (CRCL), the company behind the USDC stablecoin (USDC-USD), to bring faster and more efficient cross-border payments to banks. Indeed, this partnership will let banks use Finastra\u2019s Global PAYplus platform to settle transactions using USDC, which is a fully backed and regulated digital dollar. Even if both ends of the payment are in fiat currency, the settlement can still happen through USDC, thereby giving banks a quicker and cheaper option for moving money internationally.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\n- Take advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nIt is worth noting that right now, many banks rely on long and complex correspondent banking chains for cross-border payments, which can cause delays and lead to extra costs. However, Finastra\u2019s clients\u2014who process more than $5 trillion in global transactions every day\u2014can use Circle\u2019s USDC infrastructure to settle payments almost instantly. At the same time, they can still meet compliance requirements and manage foreign exchange needs.\nThis setup helps banks avoid building entirely new systems for processing digital payments. Indeed, Finastra CEO Chris Walters said that the goal is to help banks become more modern by offering new tools that don\u2019t force them to start from scratch. At the same time, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire added that Finastra\u2019s wide reach makes it the perfect partner to expand the use of USDC in cross-border transactions.\nIs CRCL Stock a Good Buy?\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on CRCL stock based on six Buys, six Holds, and four Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average CRCL price target of $177.93 per share implies 38.7% upside potential."
