      "feedback": "**Actionable edits:**\n\n1. **Remove or revise the unsupported claim** that “the term premium has expanded by roughly 10 bp since the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction began.” The source (LF0UUL917) does not provide a term‑premium figure; either delete this sentence or replace it with a statement that the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction “has contributed to upward pressure on long‑term rates” (already cited).  \n2. **Add a confidence rating** at the end of the analysis (e.g., “Confidence: Medium – based on current Fed stance and inflation expectations”).  \n3. **Explicitly tie the causal chain**: after mentioning Fed policy, add a brief line that “inflation expectations above 2 % + rising national debt + Fed balance‑sheet contraction → higher term premium → higher mortgage rates.”  \n4. **Ensure all remaining claims are directly supported by LF0UUL917** (e.g., mortgage rate level, Fed policy, inflation expectations, debt, loan demand).  \n5. **Keep the focus tight on mortgage rates**; remove any extraneous mention of “commodity prices” or “global credit conditions” unless you can link them directly to inflation expectations and mortgage rates with a citation.",
