  "content": "BOSTON \u2014 The Red Sox signed rookie phenom Roman Anthony to an eight-year, $130 million contract on Wednesday, spending some of the cash they saved by trading Rafael Devers away on a player they hope will be the centerpiece of the next generation of Boston stars.\n\nThe 21-year-old outfielder, who has 159 major league at-bats so far, is signed through 2033, with a team option for 2034. The deal was announced with the Red Sox on a seven-game winning streak heading into Wednesday night's game against the Kansas City Royals.\n\n\"We're playing such great baseball. I didn't want to be a distraction to anyone,\" Anthony said in a pregame news conference attended by his parents and sister and teammates along with members of the ballclub's ownership, front office and coaching staff. \"But I knew that this is where I wanted to be, and I'm having a blast. And I just wanted to continue that.\"\n\nAnthony was hitless in four at-bats on Wednesday, including a 374-foot fly ball that was caught above the short right field wall by Royals outfielder Mike Yastrzemski. He is batting .276 with two homers and 19 RBIs in 47 games since making his debut in June.\n\nThe team is 32-16 since his call-up, including a 10-game winning streak heading into the All-Star break and seven straight wins when he signed his deal.\n\n\"This is a guy who was the No. 1 prospect in the sport. We've seen the impact that he's had on our major league team in just over 150 at-bats,\" Chief Baseball Officer Craig Breslow said. \"And so when we think about the future of this organization, there's no question that it got brighter today.\"\n\nAnthony's nine-figure deal, which includes a $30 million team option for 2034, buys out his five or six years of team control, and at least two seasons of free agency. He could still become a free agent at 30.\n\n\"I don't know what the future holds, but I believe that I will be the best version of myself every single day,\" said Anthony, who received a big cheer when he came to the plate in the first inning. \"It was a deal that was obviously more than enough for me and for my family and at a place that I want to be in.\"\n\nThe Red Sox have struggled to hold onto their homegrown stars lately, trading away 2018 AL MVP Mookie Betts when they couldn't sign him and then watching Xander Bogaerts leave as a free agent. The team appeared to break the trend when it signed Rafael Devers to a 10-year, $313 million deal in 2023; instead, it traded him away this season when he refused to change fielding positions.\n\nThe roster churn has led to just one postseason appearance in the past six years, as well as a feeling among fans that the team isn't willing to spend what it takes to compete for championships.\n\n\"Yes, in the past when we haven't signed homegrown players, it's hurt,\" team president Sam Kennedy said.\n\nBut Anthony now joins pitcher Brayan Bello, outfielder Ceddanne Rafaela and infielder Kristian Campbell as a future core signed to long-term deals. Pitcher Garrett Crochet, who was acquired in a trade, was also signed to an extension that would keep him in Boston until 2031.\n\n\"We're heading in the right direction. The future organization is in great hands,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said after the game, a 7-3 loss that snapped the team's seven-game winning streak. \"If you want to win, year-in and year-out, you need to do that.\"\n\nAnthony said it's a special group to be a part of.\n\n\"I try not to look too far into the future, but we're having a lot of fun and playing good baseball right now,\" he said. \"It's super exciting when we talk about how young we are and the mix that we have of the great veteran guys that we have. So there's a lot to be excited about.\"\n\nKennedy acknowledged that the unsteady roster has been difficult on fans, who buy their favorite players' jerseys only to watch them leave.\n\n\"It's OK to fall in love with our stars, and recognizing that a lot of these guys will be around for a long time,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"We're not done yet, but it's headed in the right direction. And signing our homegrown, young, talented guys is a huge part of that,\" he said. \"That's been the key piece of having success in our time here is locking up our homegrown talent who want to be here.\"",

      "text": "BOSTON \u2014 The Boston Red Sox traded Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday in a deal that could shake up pennant races on both coasts.\nDevers\u2019 agent, Nelson Montes de Oca, confirmed the deal to The Associated Press. ESPN reported that the Giants are sending Boston a package of players that includes pitchers Jordan Hicks and Kyle Harrison for the 28-year-old designated hitter, who had bristled at his demotion from third base this year.\nThe Giants were one game behind the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers heading into Sunday night\u2019s matchup between the NL West rivals. San Francisco shortstop Willy Adames said on the ESPN broadcast that the team found out about the trade 15-20 minutes before the game.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s so excited,\u201d he said in an on-field interview while playing the field in the second inning. \u201cMe, personally, I\u2019m like thrilled to have him on the team. He\u2019s one of the best hitters in the game, and to have him on the team, I think is going to help us do a lot of damage in the division. Obviously we need a bat like him in this lineup.\u201d\nA three-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $313.5 million contract with the Red Sox in 2023, Devers is batting .272 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in 73 games, including a solo shot in Boston\u2019s 2-0 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday that completed a three-game sweep.\nBut his relationship with the team began to deteriorate when the team signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman during spring training and asked Devers to move to DH; he balked before agreeing to the switch. When first baseman Triston Casas sustained a season-ending knee injury, the Red Sox approached Devers about playing the field and he declined, saying the front office \u201cshould do their jobs\u201d and look for another player.\nA day after Devers\u2019 comments to the media about playing first, Red Sox owner John Henry, team president Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow flew to Kansas City to meet with Devers and manager Alex Cora.\nThe situation became more difficult when Bregman sustained what the team called a significant right quadriceps injury on May 23.\n\u201cEverybody around the league, I think, was paying attention to that. When any team is having some kind of drama like that, with a player like Devers \u2014 he basically was the face of the franchise,\u201d Adames said before he was interrupted by Tommy Edman\u2019s home run that gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have him. Everybody\u2019s excited. So we\u2019re going to make him feel at home,\u201d Adames said. \u201cI feel like it sends a message that we\u2019re going to compete. That we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to come over here and win the division.\u201d\nThe Red Sox have won five out of six against the rival Yankees over the last two weekends to improve to 37-36, but they are still fourth in the AL East, 6 1/2 games behind division-leading New York.\nDevers was 20 when he made his major league debut with the Red Sox in 2017. He helped the Red Sox win the 2018 World Series and led the team in RBIs for five consecutive seasons from 2020-24. He has finished in the top 20 in voting for AL MVP five times.\nDevers is not the first Red Sox All-Star to be traded away: The team sent Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2020 season in a salary dump \u2014 just a year after he won the AL MVP award and led Boston to a franchise-record 108 wins and its fourth World Series title since 2004.\nBut the Devers deal is perhaps most reminiscent of the 2004 midseason shakeup when Boston traded disgruntled shortstop \u2014 and fan favorite \u2014 Nomar Garciaparra to Minnesota.\nThe Red Sox went on to win the World Series that year, ending their 86-year championship drought.\nThis is the latest big move by Buster Posey, a seven-time All-Star who took over as San Francisco\u2019s president of baseball operations in September. He signed Justin Verlander to a $15 million, one-year contract in January and Adames to a $182 million, seven-year deal in December.\n\u201cIt makes them better right now, for sure,\u201d Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw said in a TV interview from the dugout at Dodger Stadium. \u201cBuster Posey\u2019s really doing it. Good for Buster over there. He\u2019s going for it. I\u2019d consider Raffy one of the top 10 hitters in the game, at worst. He\u2019s definitely a game-changer. It will be interesting to see what position he plays over there.\u201d"

      "text": "It would be neat \u2014 and perhaps too neat \u2014 to point to the Boston Red Sox\u2019 trade of disgruntled three-time All-Star Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants in June as the moment the team turned its season around.\nOn June 15, the Red Sox agreed to deal Devers to the Giants for two pitchers and two prospects, even though Devers was in only the second season of a 10-year, $315 million extension.\nThe Red Sox were only 37-36 at the time, in part because of drama with Devers, who was frustrated with the team when it moved him from third base to designated hitter before the season. Devers was angered further when the team tried to move him to first base following an injury, which led to a contentious meeting with the front office.\nSince Devers \u2014 who signed with Boston as a 16-year-old and eventually played on the 2018 World Series championship team \u2014 was shipped out, the vibe of the Red Sox has seemingly shifted. Boston has gone 18-13 after the trade, which includes a 10-game winning streak before the All-Star game.\nBut the brief post-Devers success hasn\u2019t quelled the concerns of every fan when it comes to how the Red Sox are operating.\n\u201cHalf of Red Sox Nation was viewing the deal through the bigger picture of what ownership has done in the last five years, which is to say they dumped Mookie Betts for money reasons,\u201d said Mike Schur, the \"Parks and Recreation\" creator who is also a lifelong Boston fan. (For years, Schur wrote under the pseudonym \u201cKen Tremendous\u201d for the baseball blog Fire Joe Morgan and elsewhere.)\nIn 2020, Boston traded Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have since won two World Series with him on the team. Betts was the American League MVP in 2018 and also made four All-Star teams while he was in Boston. He was sent to Los Angeles after he rejected a contract offer from the Red Sox.\nEven if Devers is not the player Betts is, the decision to trade him clearly echoed the Betts saga to fans.\n\u201cWhere is the money going, [and] why is it not going to Mookie Betts? Why are we not winning? Why are we not getting quality talent?\u201d Himanshu Patel, a Red Sox fan, told WFXT-TV of Boston outside Fenway Park the day after Devers\u2019 departure.\n\u201cYou traded away your best player, your highest-paid player, for what I\u2019m calling Big League Chew and a bag of balls,\u201d NBC Sports Boston analyst Trenni Casey said in the wake of the trade. \u201cThis is a salary dump, and that should frustrate people.\u201d\nSchur cited shortstop Xander Bogaerts\u2019 signing with the San Diego Padres in 2022 after 10 years with the Red Sox as another prime example.\n\u201cTheir homegrown stars have been repeatedly going somewhere else, and other teams are just paying them more money,\u201d Schur said. \u201cThe Red Sox have a big-market advantage in a sport with no cap. They should be paying these guys.\"\nSchur added that there could have been justifiable baseball reasons for the Red Sox to trade Devers, who ranked 83rd in defensive wins above replacement among AL third basemen in 2024. While Boston may have potentially mismanaged Devers\u2019 positional change, the team was also justified in moving him.\nFinancially, however, the Red Sox are lagging behind their contemporaries.\nBoston ranked sixth among MLB teams with $514 million in revenue last season, according to CNBC\u2019s calculations. Boston\u2019s operating income last year was $120 million, according to Forbes.\nHowever, the Red Sox\u2019 payroll is only the 13th-highest in MLB. While calculations vary and are not exact, Boston\u2019s 2025 payroll is roughly 33% to 37% of its 2024 revenue.\nThe New York Mets, meanwhile, are estimated to be spending 74% of their 2024 revenue on payroll this season.\nWhile Red Sox fans may see an ownership group that\u2019s no longer willing to spend, at least one former executive is encouraging patience.\n\u201cYou cannot allow a player to talk to the front office or about the front office the way Devers did,\u201d said former Miami Marlins president of baseball operations David Samson, who added Boston\u2019s ownership group (which has won four championships this century) deserves more grace.\n\u201cThey have shown when it\u2019s time to spend, they\u2019ll spend,\u201d Samson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve also shown that they\u2019re smart. I just don\u2019t understand how they don\u2019t get the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n(Samson, it should be noted, oversaw a Marlins organization that routinely traded away homegrown talent because of financial fears \u2014 though Miami was and is in a much different revenue sphere from the Red Sox.)\nSchur conceded that \"the cold, hard economic calculations are not always necessarily a bad thing.\"\n\"You want your team to be smart. You don\u2019t want them to overvalue guys,\" he said. \"The problem is they are doing this with their own homegrown players. Like, the economics of this shouldn\u2019t matter anymore when it comes to Mookie Betts.\n\u201cThe Devers thing was this perfect collision of being smart about economics and also this nagging feeling about the ownership caring when it comes to the long-term stewardship of this team.\u201d\nAs for the mild success of the team since it traded Devers, Schur is level-headed, pointing to an easier schedule and the small sample size. He also added that he\u2019s the ownership\u2019s dream fan, because he will support the club no matter what.\n\u201cBut they do have to worry about people who are a little less intense than I am,\u201d Schur said. \u201cBecause if you only evaluate guys year-to-year what are you worth, then the franchise gets a little less fun to root for.\u201d\nSamson, however, believes Boston will soon reallocate the money it was spending on Devers. He also said it would be \u201ca terrible way to run a business\u201d for the Red Sox to overpay players simply because they can afford to.\n\u201cI understand what the fans are saying,\u201d Samson said. \u201cBut on the other hand, are Mets fans happy Steve Cohen spends like a drunken soldier? I would say that they won\u2019t be happy if they lose in the first round. But maybe I\u2019m wrong.\u201d"
