  "title": "Ford Unveils Universal EV Platform: 'Assembly Tree' Mirrors Tesla's 'Unboxed' Approach - Ford Motor (NYSE:F)",
  "description": "Ford unveils a Universal EV Platform for a midsize electric truck, highlighting an \"assembly tree\" akin to Tesla's \"unboxed\" build to simplify and speed production; Goldman remains Neutral with an $11 target.",
  "content": "Ford Motor Company F unveiled a Universal EV Platform for a midsize electric truck, highlighting simpler construction, streamlined manufacturing, and a structural battery for greater efficiency.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney reiterated the Neutral rating on Ford Motor, with a price forecast of $11.\n\nAfter attending Ford's Universal EV Platform event in Louisville, Delaney said the first application will be a midsize BEV truck priced around $30,000, with deliveries in 2027.\n\nAlso Read: Clearwater Analytics Gains As Investors Eye Growth Beyond Acquisition Jitters\n\nThe analyst added that the target is helped by a design with about 20% fewer parts and an assembly process roughly 15% faster.\n\nHe framed the reveal as a proof point for their \"Platforms & Power\" thesis. The platform is engineered for efficiency and uses roughly one-third less battery than first-generation EVs.\n\nIt's flexible for multiple future models, including EREVs. Delaney also said it will underpin Ford's CE1 electrical/electronic architecture, opening the door to higher-margin software and services.\n\nPer Delaney, Ford's Universal EV Platform and new production system cut parts by 20% and are expected to lift throughput by 15%, and because parts and materials drive much of vehicle COGS, he views the parts reductions as the bigger lever for a ~$30,000 starting price.\n\nThe analyst stated that the platform trims components by 20% versus a typical vehicle, including 25% fewer fasteners and 40% fewer dock-to-dock workstations.\n\nThe midsize truck's wiring harness is more than 4,000 feet shorter and about 10 kilograms lighter than Ford's first-gen EV SUV.\n\nOn the battery side, the analyst said the vehicle will use a structural pack that forms the floor with prismatic cells from the Michigan plant, enabling roughly one-third fewer cells for similar range.\n\nThis results in an estimated cost reduction of a few thousand dollars, made possible by system-level power efficiency and full-vehicle CAD visibility for engineers.\n\nDelaney said Ford is moving to an \"assembly tree\" that uses large castings.\n\nThe build splits into three parallel sub-assemblies before joining.\n\nA single-piece aluminum unicasting removes roughly three-quarters of parts, two-thirds of welds, and half of fasteners.\n\nThe front and rear then mate to a structural battery module preassembled with seats, console, and carpeting. Parts arrive to operators in kits that include fasteners, scanners, and power tools.\n\nHe added that the approach echoes Tesla's 2023 \"unboxed\" concept by modularizing work to improve access and speed.\n\nOverall, Ford is targeting about a 15% cut in assembly time.\n\nPrice Action: F shares are trading higher by 1.12% to $11.27 at last check Tuesday.",

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.

Get in before Q3 trades take off \u2192\nClearwater Analytics Holdings CWAN shares climbed Tuesday as investors looked past recent acquisition concerns, betting on sustained double-digit growth and fresh product rollouts to drive long-term momentum.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges upgraded Clearwater Analytics Holdings CWAN rating to Buy from Neutral with a price forecast of $27 on Monday.\nBorges said the stock\u2019s 30% drop over the past six months, compared with a 9% Nasdaq gain, reflects investor concerns over the quality of acquired assets and Clearwater\u2019s ability to integrate multiple acquisitions simultaneously.\nAlso Read: Clearwater Analytics\u2019 Enfusion Infusion Offers Compelling Value Proposition, Analyst Upgrades Stock\nShe argued those risks are now priced in and sees a clear catalyst path, including the September 3 Analyst Day.\nBorges expects Clearwater\u2019s core business to sustain 20%-plus annual growth over the next three to five years, driven by its automation platform, strong network effects, and cross-sell opportunities.\nShe said Clearwater\u2019s net revenue retention (NRR) is already improving, with potential upside from cross-sell as the company releases about five new products annually, targeting growth in alternative investments through partnerships with Blackstone BX and PIMCO.\nShe added that macro tailwinds could further boost results. Goldman projects three consecutive 25-basis-point rate cuts starting in September, which would lift fixed-income asset prices, about 80% of Clearwater\u2019s client AUM, and support revenue through its AUM-linked pricing model.\nIncreased capital market activity and IPO volume could also add one to two percentage points of growth in the corporate segment, which accounts for about 16% of revenue.\nBorges acknowledged investor concerns about acquisition execution, citing mixed results with past deals and the challenge of integrating Enfusion, representing about 13% of run-rate sales.\nStill, she forecasts Enfusion\u2019s growth improving from 13% to 15% by 2027, short of management\u2019s 20% target, but believes Clearwater can still achieve total business growth of 19%.\nShe noted Enfusion\u2019s recent momentum, including a record-high bookings quarter and 49 new client wins in the second quarter.\nLonger term, Borges is constructive on Clearwater\u2019s plan to build an end-to-end platform with a single security master and data plane for institutional investors, capable of providing a complete, real-time portfolio view across public and private markets.\nShe believes the market underestimates the combined platform\u2019s ability to reach a Rule of 40 profile, even before the vision is fully realized.\nPrice Action: CWAN shares traded higher by 3.55% to $19.11 at last check Tuesday.\nRead Next:\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
