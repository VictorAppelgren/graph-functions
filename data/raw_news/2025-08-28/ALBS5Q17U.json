  "title": "Fantasy football WR busts to avoid in 2025 include Garrett Wilson, Terry McLaurin",
  "description": "These wide receivers have the highest potential of being a bust and underperforming in 2025 fantasy football leagues.",
  "content": "The unfortunate truth of fantasy football is that every year, there will be players who end the season as busts.\n\nIt's statistically impossible for every player to reach his exact fantasy-point projection. Just as many players might overperform their draft position in a given year, others will fall short (maybe even well short) of their expectations.\n\nHere are four wide receivers we feel have the highest potential to be a bust in the 2025 season. In other words, do your best to avoid this quartet in fantasy football drafts over the coming weeks.\n\nIn some ways, Smith-Njigba has the upside to be a WR1 in fantasy leagues as he comes off of a breakout season with the Seahawks last year. He finished his second season as WR17 in fantasy points per game, thanks in part to a second-half stretch between Weeks 9-18 that had him in top-10 fantasy wide receiver territory.\n\nAdd in the fact that the Seahawks brought in a new quarterback, Sam Darnold, with better marks in passer rating, touchdowns and average depth of target in 2024 than previous starter Geno Smith, and the outlook looks brighter.\n\nOn top of that, Seattle traded away Smith-Njigba's biggest competition for targets: DK Metcalf.\n\nHowever, the Seahawks did bring in wide receiver Cooper Kupp, which could limit some of Smith-Njigba's upside. But more concerning is how Klint Kubiak, Seattle's new offensive coordinator, has historically liked to run his offenses. He's generally been the kind of guy who leans far heavier on the run game than the pass, and a vast majority of Kubiak's plays as the Saints' offensive coordinator last year used personnel groupings with two or fewer wide receivers.\n\nThat's concerning for a receiver like Smith-Njigba, who thrives far more from the slot (as a \"third\" receiver) than he does on the outside.\n\nMcLaurin was the talk of the town on Monday after finally signing his contract extension to stick around in Washington through 2028. But is he set up for success in fantasy football in 2025? Signs point to ... maybe not.\n\nReasons to be excited about McLaurin this season include the fact that he's been the model of consistency. Despite years of turmoil at Washington's quarterback position, last year was the wideout's fifth straight year with more than 1,000 receiving yards. Add in that Jayden Daniels seems to have solved the Commanders' quarterback problem and that it led to a career-high touchdown total (13) for McLaurin last year, and it's easy to see the hype.\n\nWhat's concerning about McLaurin is that the improved quarterback play didn't significantly enhance production in other key stats. His targets in 2024 were his fewest since his rookie season, and his yardage total didn't jump significantly, keeping his realistic ceiling around the 1,100 mark. A big reason for his improvement in fantasy football was that leap in touchdown output, rather than other factors.\n\nThe addition of fellow receiver Deebo Samuel Sr. to this offense won't exactly help McLaurin in that regard. He'll poach more of the Commanders' lead receiver's targets in general, and there will be more competition in red-zone targets specifically.\n\nMcLaurin went from being Washington's No. 1 receiver by a wide, wide margin to still being Daniels' lead wideout, but without as big a drop-off to the second option.\n\nAs with McLaurin and Smith-Njigba, there are signs of a potentially big season for Wilson. But there are also some red flags that could hold him back from reaching that high ceiling.\n\nFirst, the good. Wilson is easily the leading receiver in the Jets' passing offense, and there isn't much of a competition there. The second option for new quarterback Justin Fields is either Josh Reynolds, Allen Lazard or rookie tight end Mason Taylor. Wilson is also coming off of a season in which he set career-high marks in receptions (101) yards (1,104) and touchdowns (7), which is only more encouraging.\n\nBut here comes the bad. His quarterback is former college teammate Fields, a passer who hasn't managed to stay healthy for a full season in his career and one who spent most of last year on the bench. A passer who also struggled to throw the ball accurately and with consistency throughout much of training camp and in preseason matchups. A passer who appears to trust his legs far more than his arm.\n\nSo while the floor may be high for Wilson \u2013 thanks to the higher volume he will likely see due to the lackluster receivers room in New York \u2013 his ceiling is capped significantly by Fields' limitations as a passer.\n\nOnce again, we come to a receiver whose outlook for 2025 appears phenomenal on the surface. Little serious competition for targets and due to catch passes from a well-established quarterback.\n\nHowever, Metcalf's landing in Pittsburgh means he ends up in a fantasy wasteland for pass-catchers.\n\nSteelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has a well-established history of tanking the fantasy value of his top receivers. Outside of A.J. Brown's 2019 and 2020 seasons in Tennessee, no player in a Smith-led offense has surpassed 1,000 receiving yards or more than five touchdowns.\n\nFalcons tight end Kyle Pitts had 770 yards and five scores in 2021. Receiver Drake London had 866 yards, four touchdowns and 905 yards, two touchdowns in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Last year, then-Steelers receiver George Pickens had 900 yards and three touchdowns in his first year under Smith, one season after leading the league in yards per reception.\n\nSo, like Wilson, Metcalf has a decent floor because of the volume potential in Pittsburgh's otherwise unimpressive receivers room. But his ceiling is capped hard by the Smith-run offense.",

      "text": "Should you draft Ashton Jeanty in fantasy? Preseason stats, outlook for Raiders RB\n- Las Vegas Raiders rookie running back Ashton Jeanty's preseason performance has concerned some fantasy football managers.\n- Historically, running backs taken in the NFL draft's top 10 have performed well in their rookie seasons.\n- Jeanty is projected to be the Raiders' starting running back and has a favorable situation in a run-first offense.\nTo draft, or not to draft, Ashton Jeanty \u2013 that is the question.\nThe Las Vegas Raiders' rookie running back has sent the fantasy football community into a spiral following a lackluster preseason performance. It hasn't been the introduction to the NFL that many thought coming into these practice games, but it's important to remember they play preseason contests for a reason.\nJeanty finished with 12 carries for 37 yards and a touchdown in his limited action, while also adding one reception for two yards.\nThose aren't gaudy numbers that will excite fantasy managers, but perhaps there is a silver lining to all of this.\nTo put it in perspective, Ja'Marr Chase famously struggled to catch the ball ahead of his rookie season. The Cincinnati Bengals star receiver quickly put those concerns behind him once the regular season arrived and has been one of fantasy football's best players since.\nThat's not to say that Jeanty will be the RB1 at season's end, but the fantasy football world sometimes puts too much stock into games that don't really matter.\nSo, should you draft Jeanty? It's complicated \u2013 or maybe analysts are just making it seem that way.\nShould you draft Ashton Jeanty in fantasy?\nDon't let a few preseason games prevent you from drafting Jeanty.\nAll the stars have aligned for the Raiders rookie to put together a strong first season. Fantasy football is a situational game where opportunity reigns supreme \u2013 something Jeanty will have no shortage of.\nHead coach Pete Carroll prefers a run-first approach and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly can deliver it. Kelly's offenses love to play at a fast pace and have typically enjoyed strong rushing attacks.\nIt's been a while since Kelly last patrolled an NFL sideline and his offense has evolved over time. However, his offenses did finish top-10 in rushing yards three times in four seasons \u2013 including No. 1 in 2013 as the Philadelphia Eagles' head coach. Kelly's teams never finished lower than No. 15 in his short NFL stint.\nPerhaps more important than anything else, Jeanty enters as the clear RB1 in Vegas \u2013 a true workhorse for the silver and black.\nHistory suggests that positive results should follow. In the last 10 years, only six running backs have been drafted in the top 10. All of them finished as top-10 fantasy running backs in their rookie seasons:\n- Bijan Robinson (2023): RB9\n- Touches: 272\n- Scrimmage Yards: 1,463\n- Total Touchdowns: 8\n- Saquon Barkley (2018): RB1\n- Touches: 352\n- Scrimmage Yards: 2,028\n- Total Touchdowns: 15\n- Christian McCaffrey (2017): RB10\n- Touches: 197\n- Scrimmage Yards: 1,086\n- Total Touchdowns: 7\n- Leonard Fournette (2017): RB9\n- Touches: 304\n- Scrimmage Yards: 1,342\n- Total Touchdowns: 10\n- Ezekiel Elliott (2016): RB2\n- Touches: 354\n- Scrimmage Yards: 1,994\n- Total Touchdowns: 15\n- Todd Gurley (2015): RB9\n- Touches: 250\n- Scrimmage Yards: 1,294\n- Total Touchdowns: 10\nTeams don't typically like to show too much in the preseason and it's no different for the Raiders.\n\"We ran the most fundamental plays you can run,\" Carroll told reporters after the team's first preseason game. \"In our format of going through the preseason, we'll continue to be pretty basic, just to keep our edge for the opener and the first three, four games. Teams don't know who we are and they're gonna have to find out as we go.\"\nThe second game gave fans a taste of what could be as Jeanty ripped off a monster 13-yard rush and later added a touchdown.\nIn other words, he'll be fine.\nVerdict: Fantasy football doesn't have to be a complicated game and history tells us that Jeanty should be fine once the action really begins to matter. His ADP has fluctuated throughout the draft process -- current Fantasy Pros ADP: 14 overall, RB5 -- following some uninspiring preseason action. Don't be someone who puts too much stock into that; instead, take advantage of any uneasiness from fellow league mates. Jump at the opportunity to select this budding star at the back of Round 1 or the beginning of Round 2, depending on your league size."

      "text": "3 fantasy football tight ends to avoid in 2025 drafts\nWhen the clock starts ticking during fantasy football drafts, it's best to move forward with caution.\nWhile much of the focus is on finding the best sleepers, it's also prudent to be aware of potential busts.\nTight ends aren't often considered a highly valued position. In 2025, only three players are being selected inside the top 50 of fantasy drafts, according to FantasyPros' average draft position (ADP). That said, these three tight ends are being drafted as starters in the majority of leagues, but could fail to meet expectations.\n2025 FANTASY FOOTBALL SLEEPERS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nTight ends to fade in 2025 fantasy football drafts\nTravis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs\nThe veteran tight end has been a staple in fantasy lineups for over a decade, but it's time to start fading him at his current ADP. He had declining production in 2024 and still managed to finish as TE6 in PPR points per game. He was the third-most targeted tight end in the NFL with 133 targets and led the position in red-zone targets (26). So why fade the soon-to-be 36-year-old in 2025?\nIt's not a complete fade but it's probably better to treat Kelce as a borderline TE1 than a sure-fire stud at this stage. Only one tight end in NFL history has finished with more than 90 catches at the age of 36 or older (Tony Gonzalez, 2012).\nKelce's yards per route run and yards after the catch both declined in each of the last three seasons. The biggest question mark surrounding Kelce heading into 2025 is the availability of wide receiver Rashee Rice. With Rice healthy, Kelce averaged just four targets per game. However, following Rice's season-ending knee injury, Kelce averaged over nine targets per game. There's a chance Rice could miss half of the season due to a suspension, but there's also a chance Rice only misses a couple of games. Kelce's usage hinges largely on Rice's presence and the risk at taking him as the TE5 outweighs the production at this stage.\nEvan Engram, Denver Broncos\nThis potential bust could backfire if Engram were to surprise and lead his new team in targets in 2025. However, the likelihood of that happening is slim because he is coming off his worst season and a torn labrum, which required surgery.\nEngram joined the Broncos in free agency, and some are excited about his potential in Sean Payton's offense. But Payton - who has been a head coach for 18 NFL seasons - has only had a tight end finish inside the top 10 in PPR five times. Those being seasons from Jimmy Graham (2011, 2013, 2014), Ben Watson (2015) and Jared Cook (2019).\nThe soon-to-be 31-year-old has relied heavily on volume more than explosiveness and touchdowns. He has failed to find the end zone more than four times in a season since 2017. He'll play second fiddle to Courtland Sutton. Engram could even potentially finish third on the team in targets behind third-year breakout candidate Marvin Mims Jr. Expectations should be tempered for Engram at his current TE8 ADP.\nColston Loveland, Chicago Bears\nIt's challenging to fall in love with Loveland and trust him to finish inside fantasy football's top 15 tight ends in 2025.\nThe rookie is a terrific prospect in a Bears offense that is expected to improve. New head coach Ben Johnson is calling the shots and he was the offensive coordinator in Detroit when Sam LaPorta finished as TE1 overall as a rookie in 2023. The issue for Loveland is that there are plenty of mouths to feed as Chicago loaded up on offense in the offseason. The presence of wide receivers DJ Moore, Rome Odunze and Luther Burden, along with veteran tight end Cole Kmet will likely keep the rookie from Michigan in deep TE2 range all season.\nIt's unlikely Loveland can make a significant mark in such a crowded room but he's still a worthwhile pick in dynasty leagues. He has top-10 draft capital and will likely grow in the Bears offense in the coming years, but don't expect him to be elite in 2025."

      "text": "3 fantasy football QBs to avoid in 2025 drafts\nFantasy football managers want to land the best sleepers in their drafts, but knowing the potential busts to avoid is just as important, especially at quarterback.\nQuarterback busts look a little different than busts at other positions. That's because quarterback is typically one of the deepest positions in fantasy football, so even being a steady producer isn't necessarily enough to become a league-winning or starter-worthy signal-caller.\nWith that in mind, projecting out quarterback busts isn't necessarily about which players will have bad seasons. It's more about identifying those who have lower ceilings than their similarly drafted counterparts.\nWhether it's due to volume concerns or regression around the quarterback, there are a variety of reasons to approach certain passers with caution. Below is a look at a few quarterbacks who should be treated more as streamers than fantasy starters in 2025.\n3 fantasy football QB busts to avoid in 2025 drafts\nJared Goff, Detroit Lions\nGoff has finished the last three seasons as a top-10 fantasy quarterback. Will he be able to continue that positive momentum in 2025? Perhaps, but Goff is entering the season without Ben Johnson as his offensive coordinator for the first time since 2021.\nJohnson, who now coaches the Chicago Bears, was a major catalyst for Goff's improvement. He helped lead Goff to a career high in passing touchdowns (37) and passer rating (111.8) last season, when the 30-year-old finished as the QB6. However, in six seasons without Johnson, Goff has finished better than QB13 in fantasy just once. That came in 2018, his best season with Sean McVay.\nOccasionally, quarterbacks can overcome the loss of talented offensive coordinators, with Baker Mayfield notably finding success in 2024 after losing Dave Canales. That could create some hope that Goff can continue to be a fantasy asset even without Johnson.\nBut given Goff's track record and the retirement of the Lions' stalwart center Frank Ragnow, it's probably better to treat Goff as more of a borderline QB1 than a sure-fire fantasy starter.\nJustin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers\nThere's no doubt Herbert is a talented quarterback, and he was one of the league's most efficient passers in 2024. He had a league-best interception rate of 0.6% and posted a career-best 101.7 passer rating in his first year working with Jim Harbaugh.\nDespite this, Herbert finished the season ranked 16th among quarterbacks in fantasy points per game (FPPG). That was largely due to his middling total of 25 touchdowns, stemming from a lack of passing opportunities in the red zone.\nHerbert attempted just 57 passes inside his opponents' 20-yard lines last season, tied with Tua Tagovailoa for 17th-most in the NFL. That might not sound bad, but it's worth noting Herbert was one of just 14 quarterbacks to make 17 starts last season. Among those quarterbacks, his 57 red-zone passing attempts ranked second-fewest ahead of only Geno Smith (54).\nThe Chargers don't appear likely to change their run-heavy red zone approach in 2025 after signing Najee Harris in free agency and spending a first-round pick on Omarion Hampton. That will once again limit Herbert's ceiling and make him more of a situational streamer than a legitimate fantasy starter.\nJordan Love, Green Bay Packers\nLove tantalized fantasy managers in the second half of the 2023 NFL season, when he racked up 2,150 yards, 18 touchdowns and just one interception over the final eight games. Many believed him to be a potential breakout candidate in 2024; instead, he ranked 18th in FPPG among quarterbacks.\nPart of Love's issue was his lack of opportunities to throw the ball. He averaged just 28.3 attempts per game, which ranked 26th among 36 quarterbacks who qualified for the NFL's passer rating leaderboard last season. By comparison, Love averaged 34.9 attempts per game during his torrid close to the 2023 NFL season.\nCould the Packers decide to give Love more opportunities to throw the ball in 2025? It's possible, especially since the team spent a first-round pick on a wide receiver, Matthew Golden, for the first time since 2002.\nBut if Love remains unable to exceed 30 passing attempts per game, it's hard to imagine him cracking fantasy football's top 15 quarterbacks, let alone the top 10."

      "text": "Your guide to drafting fantasy football D/ST in 2025\nReliability.\nIt's a word that often comes up when purchasing a car or even when you're about to draft a defense/special teams (D/ST) unit in fantasy football. After all, a broken-down vehicle on the side of the road is still a problem \u2013 even if it has all the bells and whistles. In the same vein, you wouldn't want to leave your draft with players like Josh Allen and Saquon Barkley only to be saddled with the Carolina Panthers' defense, right?\nIf you're in the process of crushing your fantasy draft, or even just preparing for one, it's important not to let the little things drag you down. Just as you'd change the oil and air filters on your vehicle, you'll want to secure a solid defense that won't cause bigger issues down the road if left unattended.\nD/ST may not be glamorous, but it's honest work \u2013 and a thankless job. The Denver Broncos' D/ST returns to the top spot in 2025, but keep an eye on teams like the New York Giants further down the rankings for their sleeper potential.\nThe rankings will undoubtedly change as the season rolls along, but we're here to get you started.\nSome weeks, it may just be the reason why you win. The important thing is that we don't want it to be the reason why you lose.\nThat's why we've compiled our 2025 D/ST rankings in one place to serve as your draft guide to the position. Here's a breakdown for drafting fantasy defenses as the Week 1 kickoff inches closer.\n2025 Fantasy football rankings D/ST\n1. Denver Broncos. Despite a difficult division and a middle-of-the-road schedule, the Broncos maintain their hold on the top spot until proven otherwise. They were fantasy's best unit in 2024 and added talent in the offseason. With the Titans and Colts on tap to start the season, Denver can get out to a hot start. Couple that with a favorable schedule for the fantasy playoffs, including two matchups at home, and there is a recipe for success.\n2. Houston Texans. The Texans benefit from playing in a division that will feature a rookie quarterback in Tennessee and a situation in Indianapolis that will have defensive coordinators salivating. An aggressive DeMeco Ryans defense should only make life more difficult, especially after adding C.J. Gardner-Johnson to the fold. They can challenge for the best fantasy D/ST of 2025.\n3. Philadelphia Eagles. Philly lost Milton Williams, Josh Sweat and Darius Slay, but is littered with talent across the board. After a dominant Super Bowl performance, there is more than enough here to continue their strong play.\n4. Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens are the fast food of the fantasy D/ST realm. It's consistent and you know exactly what you're getting. Sometimes they're better than expected, but it's never bad enough to prevent you from coming back. That counts for something.\n5. Pittsburgh Steelers. Another fantasy staple, Pittsburgh has gone all-in for 2025. T.J. Watt's contract dispute ended before it became an issue and the secondary got an upgrade in Jalen Ramsey. Coming off another top-5 finish in 2024, this remains one of the more consistent units to trust in fantasy.\n6. Minnesota Vikings. Brian Flores runs an aggressive defense, but J.J. McCarthy's inexperience as a starter could put this unit in some tough spots this season. Some key departures mean they're likely to take a step back, but not by much. Still, this isn't a D/ST for the risk-averse.\n7. Buffalo Bills. The Bills are favored in every game of the 2025 season, meaning they should have plenty of positive game scripts to work with. After forcing 32 turnovers last season, there is no reason to believe a repeat isn't in store, especially since the Bills are no strangers to repeating history.\n8. Seattle Seahawks. This team is almost unrecognizable, resembling a group thrown together by the computer in the fifth season of a Madden franchise mode. Yet that is more on the offensive side of the ball as Mike Macdonald's team finished as DST6 in 2024. Having added even more pieces this offseason, things are looking up on young Macdonald's farm.\n9. New York Jets. The Jets defense took a step back in 2024, but should benefit from the return of Jermaine Johnson and the addition of Aaron Glenn as head coach. With a team that projects to run the ball and control the clock, their defense should be on the field a lot less in 2025 \u2013 creating an all-around more effective unit, even with the question mark that is their offense.\n10. Detroit Lions. Despite a lengthy list of injuries in 2024, the Lions still managed a DST10 finish to the season. With new coordinators on both sides of the ball, however, some concerns arise. The reinforcements on the way, especially the return of Aidan Hutchinson, should make the transition smoother though.\n11. Los Angeles Rams. The linebackers are an issue, but the Rams looked like a Super Bowl contender last season and have more than enough in the trenches to continue being a problem for the opposition.\n12. Green Bay Packers. There is no real weakness in this defense, but they were fairly reliant on turnovers for their fantasy production in 2024. While a team like the Bills worked to address their pass rush concerns, the Packers face the reality of playing in a tougher division with a less-dominant offense. They are still a worthy selection, but it comes with its risks.\n13. New York Giants. Big Blue has sleeper potential in 2025, boasting a pass rush that promises to inflict pain and suffering on opposing quarterbacks with Brian Burns and Abdul Carter off the edge. Russell Wilson won't put them in a bad spot with costly turnovers either, boosting the floor for what could be a sneaky good defense. There's a real chance you can get this potential top-10 unit at a significant discount.\n14. Los Angeles Chargers. Jesse Minter appears to be on the fast track to landing a head coaching job in the near future and it's all thanks to a solid defense. They'll need some progression from their young players in the secondary and production from Khalil Mack, but they can be on the rise throughout the season if things break right.\n15. Kansas City Chiefs. Another year older and plagued by a tough 2024 fantasy season, it's hard to get on the Chiefs' bandwagon when it comes to their DST in fantasy. Steve Spagnuolo has done a great job of building Kansas City into a solid unit over the years, but there are better options available.\n16. San Francisco 49ers. The return of Robert Saleh also brought some additional investments on defense. San Francisco spent five picks in the top 113 of the draft on defensive players and will look for a return to form in 2025.\n17. Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys are hoping for a bounce-back season after parting ways with Mike McCarthy. Former Bears coach Matt Eberflus wasn't effective in the big chair, but the hope is he can find some effectiveness again as a coordinator. Dallas has the pieces in place to continue forcing turnovers and generating pressure. Provided they figure out a deal with Micah Parsons, there's no reason they can't return to being a solid fantasy option again in 2025.\n18. Arizona Cardinals. A defensive-minded head coach, Jonathan Gannon had the privilege of investing six of seven picks for his unit through the draft. With improvement at all three levels and the signing of Josh Sweat, the Cardinals also feature a schedule with some good matchups early on. The narrative can change quickly for the redbirds.\n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n20. Cleveland Browns\n21. Washington Commanders\n22. New England Patriots\n23. Chicago Bears\n24. Atlanta Falcons\n25. Cincinnati Bengals\n27. New Orleans Saints\n28. Miami Dolphins\n29. Jacksonville Jaguars\n30. Las Vegas Raiders\n31. Tennessee Titans\n32. Carolina Panthers"

      "text": "5 best fantasy football running back value picks in 2025\nNFL teams are running the ball more productively than at almost any point in the last decade. The running game is back but that hasn't always translated to fantasy football.\nEntering the 2025 NFL season, there are a handful of players widely expected to be the top scorers at the position. Reigning Offensive Player of the Year Saquon Barkley, Bijan Robinson, Jahmyr Gibbs, Derrick Henry and Christian McCaffrey are among those experts predict will be reliable double-digit scorers week in and week out.\nLook at the next tier of running backs in fantasy football and you'll find productive players at the position with some question marks. Ashton Jeanty has plenty of hype but is a rookie in arguably the toughest division in the NFL. Bucky Irving had an impressive rookie season but enters Year 2 with a new offensive coordinator. Johnathan Taylor hasn't played a full season since 2021 which negates his solid production when on the field.\nThis list isn't about the first two or even three tiers of fantasy football running backs. This is about finding value beyond the top 15 players at the position entering 2025. That's where mid-round flyers on players could make the difference between competing for a title and hoping to avoid last-place punishments.\nUSA TODAY Sports identified five value picks at running back who could outplay their current average draft position (ADP) in 2025:\n2025 fantasy football RB value picks\nADP is from FantasyPros and in half-PPR league formats.\nKenneth Walker III, Seattle Seahawks\n- ADP: RB17, OVR42\nThe fourth-year running back has never been down on talent. His issue throughout his career has been availability; he's missed 10 games over his first three seasons in the NFL.\nThe Seahawks had the fifth-worst rushing offense in the NFL a year ago. New offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak will offer schematic improvements that should play to Walker's strengths, specifically in outside zone runs. He's going this low likely because of injury concerns and worries about Seattle's offensive line. The Seahawks spent their first round pick on guard Grey Zabel, showing how committed they are to improving up front. That's enough reason to have optimism about Walker in 2025.\nTony Pollard, Tennessee Titans\n- ADP: RB25, OVR61\nPollard managed 1,317 yards from scrimmage and five touchdowns last season in a Titans offense that was a bottom-eight unit in points and yards. Tennessee overhauled a lot on offense this offseason with a new quarterback in No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward, two new starters on the offensive line and a revamped wide receiver room.\nAll of this should see the Titans offense take a step forward on offense to at least get closer to the middle of the pack. That rising tide should elevate Pollard to a solid No. 2 running back. Tyjae Spears' injury will keep him sidelined for the rest of the preseason, giving Pollard the majority of touches with the first-team offense.\nKaleb Johnson, Pittsburgh Steelers\n- ADP: RB28, OVR71\nRookie running backs can be hard to predict but Johnson may be in a good situation to outproduce his current draft position. Even with the arrival of quarterback Aaron Rodgers and wide receiver DK Metcalf, offensive coordinator Arthur Smith will still want to run the ball effectively. Johnson fits the bill well as an early-down back in that system.\nA healthy offensive line in Pittsburgh could take a step this year with center Zach Frazier, right guard Mason McCormick and right tackle Troy Fautanu all entering their second year in the NFL. In his time as a play-caller on offense, Smith has ranked in the top-10 in rushing attempts five times in six NFL seasons. Last year the Steelers were fourth in the league in rushing attempts. The volume is there for Johnson to produce beyond his RB28 status.\nJordan Mason, Minnesota Vikings\n- ADP: RB34, OVR92\nMinnesota has traditionally had one primary running back during coach Kevin O'Connell's tenure. That's reportedly changed this offseason during training camp as it's been closer to an even split between Aaron Jones Sr. and Mason.\nThe Vikings invested in the offensive line with new starters at center and both guard spots. They're dropping in an unproven quarterback in J.J. McCarthy. This should lead Minnesota to rely more on the running game in 2025 than in years past.\nThe Vikings traded one of their few draft picks for Mason this offseason. Through the first seven games of 2024, only two running backs had more rushing yards: Henry and Barkley. He's been productive when given the opportunity and could usurp the 30-year-old Jones as the Vikings' primary back over the course of the season.\nJavonte Williams, Dallas Cowboys\n- ADP: RB36, OVR111\nRegardless of their playoff chances in 2025, the Cowboys should be a more productive offense on the ground. They spent their top pick on guard Tyler Booker, a mauler in the run game, and brought in Klayton Adams from Arizona to be their offensive coordinator. Adams had a big role in the Cardinals' running scheme which has been one of the most diverse in the league over recent seasons.\nWilliams is currently slated to start for the Cowboys. He played in all 17 games last season for Denver with 11 starts but managed just 859 yards from scrimmage. Williams should have the edge over other running backs in Dallas to start the season. He could easily benefit from the ground game's improvement under Adams and outplay his status as a low-end RB3."

      "text": "6 fantasy football RB bust candidates based on trends\nDrafting an early-round bust in fantasy football is like being a Jets fan. Your season is over before it even starts.\nFor this article, we'll define \"bust\" as someone with a positional average draft position (ADP) of 30 or higher who missed his ADP by at least 10 slots. For example, if a back had an ADP of RB14, he'd have had to finish as the RB24 or worse to be considered a bust.\nRather than trying to pinpoint busts, we'll use a process of elimination to exclude players whose trends don't align with previous busts. In other words, we'll look back at all the running backs who busted over the last eight years, attempt to identify common trends, and eliminate those who don't meet those benchmarks.\nAn important note before we dive in \u2014 this is a shortlist of candidates based on trends. These are NOT predictions.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\n2025 fantasy football RB busts\nNote: All fantasy scoring references are half-PPR, and all ADP data is via FantasyPros.\nTo generate this shortlist, we'll look at the running back busts from the last eight years and identify common trends from their preceding seasons. Rookies are excluded, given that they're in their first season.\nIn all, there were 80 players during this stretch who fit the bust criteria, but we'll focus on the runners who didn't bust primarily due to injury. To do that, we'll narrow the parameters to those who busted despite missing four games or fewer. That gives us a list of 31 running backs.\nHere are the trends:\n0.38 \u2014 As you'll gather from most of these trends, inefficiency is a key indicator for a potential bust. In our sample, 25 of the 31 backs averaged 0.38 fantasy points per snap or less.\n0.85 \u2014 On a very related note, 25 of the 31 running back busts averaged less than 0.85 fantasy points per touch. Using fantasy points per opportunity would have yielded similar results.\n0.45 \u2014 There are several ways to dissect volume, but one of the most predictive signals is how often a player gets the ball when he's on the field. On that note, 24 of the 31 busts averaged fewer than 0.45 touches per snap in their preceding season.\n9.8 \u2014 The correlation of pass-catching to fantasy production is well-documented, and that's especially true in today's NFL. Of our 31-player sample, only three averaged more than 9.8 yards after the catch per reception.\n14 \u2014 The final trend ties in two predictive metrics, volume and high-value pass-catching opportunities. Over the last eight years, only four of the 31 running back busts totaled 14 or more red zone targets.\nSo, who are the fantasy football RB bust candidates?\nHere are the six players who failed to be eliminated by any of the thresholds above (ranked in order of positional ADP):\n- Kyren Williams (11.7 ADP) - Unimpressive efficiency is something Williams has in common with most of the highly drafted busts in recent years. Among the 17 busts in our sample with an ADP higher than RB20, Kyren's 2024 season would have ranked third-worst in yards per touch and yards per snap, as well as dead last in yards per route run. He'd also have been in the bottom third in fantasy points per opportunity. Additionally, the Rams have two top-120 picks on the depth chart behind him (Blake Corum and Jarquez Hunter), so his leash might not be as long if the inefficiency continues.\n- Breece Hall (16.0 ADP) - Hall already busted last year, though that came at a premium ADP of RB2 (he finished as the RB17). Being inefficient in a potential timeshare on a bad offense could result in a second consecutive bust season for Hall. At least this year's ADP won't kill your team if he tanks.\n- Kenneth Walker (16.7 ADP) - Based strictly on his 2024 performance, Walker is a risk on two fronts. His 3.7 yards per carry ranks dead last among all backs going inside the top-30 this year, and he's also missed 20% of Seattle's games through three seasons. That said, the upside is tantalizing, and the risk seems to be baked into his ADP.\n- Chuba Hubbard (17.7 ADP) - Hubbard ended up being one of the best picks in fantasy last year, but there are reasons for skepticism ahead of 2025. The 26-year-old wasn't very efficient, particularly as a receiver. Among the 43 backs with at least 20 receptions, Hubbard ranked last in yards per route run and tied for last in yards after catch per reception.\n- Tony Pollard (24.0 ADP) - Among all running backs with a top-30 positional ADP, only Isiah Pacheco averaged fewer fantasy points per opportunity than Pollard. Pollard struggled as a receiver, finishing the 2024 season in a tie for last place in yards after the catch per reception. Tyjae Spears starting the season on IR gives Pollard some leeway, but his leash might not be as long this year.\n- Tyrone Tracy Jr. (28.7 ADP) - Tracy was one of the best waiver pickups last year, but his volume and efficiency were all over the place. Among the top 30 backs drafted this year, Tracy ranked last in opportunities per snap and second-worst in fantasy points per snap last season. Even after he took over as lead back in Week 5, he still had five games with fewer than 14 touches. In addition to a healthy Devin Singletary, he'll have to fend off rookie Cam Skattebo in New York's backfield this season.\nFantasy football RB workload concerns\nFour running backs had at least 344 touches last season \u2014 Saquon Barkley, Bijan Robinson, Kyren Williams and Derrick Henry. Since 2010, 34 players have handled that kind of workload, and here are their trends from the following season:\n- All but five of the backs (85%) saw declines in their per-game production the following season, including 22 who experienced declines of 20% or more.\n- All but five of those runners sustained total fantasy-point declines larger than 17%. More than two-thirds of the 34 backs had their total points decline by at least 26%."

      "text": "4 best fantasy football wide receiver value picks in 2025\nWith the benefit of hindsight, finding the players who would have made value picks for fantasy managers in previous years is easy. The hard part is identifying those value plays before fantasy football draft season.\nIf everyone knew the season Brian Thomas Jr. would have for the Jacksonville Jaguars as a rookie last year, he would have been drafted high above his ADP (average draft position) of WR48. The same goes for fellow rookie breakout and Los Angeles Chargers wideout Ladd McConkey, or a surprise performer like the Detroit Lions' Jameson Williams.\nUSA TODAY Sports identified four value picks ahead of the 2025 regular season who could boost teams far more than their ADP might indicate.\nTop 2025 fantasy football WR value picks\nDraft value does not always match the potential impact that a wide receiver can have on a fantasy football team. These players are some of the guys with some of the best potential-impact-to-draft-value ratios:\nNote: ADP is from FantasyPros and in half-PPR league formats.\nCourtland Sutton, Denver Broncos\nSutton quickly became the favorite target of rookie quarterback Bo Nix last year, seeing more than twice as many targets (135) as the next Broncos wide receiver (55) and catching 81 of them for 1,081 yards.\nHis eight touchdowns were a strong follow-up to his 10-touchdown season in 2023, giving him a rate of 0.59 touchdowns per start, according to PFF. That is the fifth-best of all wideouts over the last two seasons.\nThe coming year is Sutton's age-30 season and a contract year for the seven-year veteran. He's currently listed as WR23 but finished last year as WR15. Part of Sutton's dip in value could be attributed to the arrival of tight end Evan Engram, but if Sutton can take another step forward together with Nix in the quarterback's second year and keep up his red-zone usage, his value could end up near WR1 territory.\nTetairoa McMillan, Carolina Panthers\nMcMillan has the highest fantasy football upside of any rookie wide receiver in this year's draft class. Travis Hunter's split snap count between offense and defense could limit his fantasy potential as a wideout, and McMillan is joining a team that was still in need of a true lead wide receiver, unlike Jacksonville.\nWhat may scare some fantasy managers off from drafting McMillan is that his quarterback is the still-unproven Bryce Young, entering his third season. But down the stretch last year, Young started to look every bit of the quarterback that earned him No. 1 overall pick status, and that was without a true leading receiver. McMillan, the No. 8 overall pick this year, is poised to be that No. 1 option in his first year in Carolina with his only competition for targets being an aging Adam Thielen, a drop-prone Xavier Legette and Jalen Coker, who is still fighting for a starting job.\nFANTASY FOOTBALL EXPERTISE: Subscribe to The Huddle for exclusive fantasy stats, analysis\nCalvin Ridley, Tennessee Titans\nIn his first year with the Titans, Ridley managed to catch 64 of his 120 targets for 1,017 yards and four touchdowns. He finished as WR29 last year. And now he has a potentially massive upgrade at quarterback throwing him the ball.\nRidley and rookie Cam Ward already showed off their connection in the Titans' first preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with Ridley leading the team with his 50 yards on three catches.\nIf Tennessee's offense can perform better than one that ranked near the bottom of the NFL now that it has a more consistent starting quarterback option, Ridley's fantasy outlook should improve greatly.\nHis yards per route run, average depth of target and yards after catch numbers were all better in his first year in head coach Brian Callahan's offense than they were in Jacksonville in 2023. The touchdowns just weren't there in as high a volume. There's reason to believe that in 2025, his connection with Ward will grant him a higher fantasy output and make him a nice value pick.\nTyreek Hill, Miami Dolphins\nHill is simultaneously a value pick and one of the riskiest picks fantasy managers can make ahead of the 2025 season.\nHe's coming off the worst of his three seasons in Miami, failing to surpass 1,000 yards after nearing 2,000 the year prior. He reportedly played through a wrist injury all year, contended with injuries to his injury-prone starting quarterback and finished as WR18 after holding an ADP of WR2 prior to the season. It was a worrying drop-off and possible indicator of worse to come as Hill enters his age-31 season.\nBut in reaction to last year's outcome, Hill's value has fallen to a borderline pick for a WR2/3. His current ADP sits at WR12 and 28th overall. For a player that had put together two straight seasons of exactly 119 receptions with more than 1,700 yards in each, that could turn into absurd value. It's risky, since managers would be betting on Hill leaving his wrist injury problem behind him and the health of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, but the ceiling is sky-high."

Smith\u2011Njigba\u2019s new QB and offensive coordinator favor the run, while McLaurin faces a crowded receiving corps and a modest target ceiling. Wilson\u2019s rookie quarterback and a tight\u2011end\u2011heavy offense may cap his ceiling, and Metcalf\u2019s move to a run\u2011heavy Steelers system under Arthur Smith could suppress his production. Overall, the piece advises managers to steer clear of these players to avoid potential busts in their drafts.",
