      "rationale": "US net migration is a macro‑demographic trend that influences labor markets, fiscal pressures, and consumption over a medium‑to‑long horizon. It does not generate immediate intraday price moves but serves as a supporting signal for regime shifts and structural analysis. Therefore it fits the 4‑level category of slow‑impact, supporting macro information."
