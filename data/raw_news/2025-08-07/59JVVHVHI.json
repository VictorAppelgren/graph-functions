  "content": "IRVING, Texas, Aug. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Joule Capital Partners, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, and Wheeler Machinery Co. today announced an agreement to power Joule's High Performance Compute Data Center Campus in Utah. Joule, a next-generation infrastructure company, aims to create the largest single campus in Utah and operate the most advanced data centers in the world.\n\nBringing multiple gigawatts of capacity to Utah \n\nThis initiative will provide four gigawatts of total energy to the center of the Intermountain West. The project will deliver groundbreaking prime power and integrated combined cooling heat and power (CCHP) solutions with a by-design liquid cooling architecture. Powered by a fleet of Caterpillar's latest G3520K generator sets and support equipment, the distributed generation system produces electricity and captures waste heat to power and cool next-generation, high-density server systems. The solution includes 1.1 gigawatt hours of grid forming battery energy storage along with backup power generation served by diverse fuel sources. Thanks to Caterpillar's expanding U.S.-based manufacturing footprint, the full generation package can be delivered ahead of most other generation technologies. This speed-to-power advantage is critical for meeting the explosive growth in demand for compute capacity.\n\nBeyond the gensets, this fully integrated system includes the controls, switchgear, inverters, energy storage solutions, CCHP and more, providing a complete power solution for the Joule data center and a competitive advantage for Joule's tenants. Caterpillar and Wheeler will also provide service and support for the products and solutions, ensuring uptime and availability targets are met.\n\n\"This project represents the core of Joule's mission\u2014to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) ready compute capacity by pairing world-class data center campuses with reliable, on-demand power,\" said David Gray, President of Joule Capital Partners. \"By combining Caterpillar's advanced energy systems with Wheeler's local expertise, we can bring gigawatt-scale capacity to market faster and more efficiently than ever before, ensuring our tenants have the power and reliability they need to thrive in the next generation of high-performance computing.\"\n\n\"Caterpillar is uniquely positioned to tackle the growing energy needs for artificial intelligence and the evolving needs of modern infrastructure. This project is a perfect example of how we can deliver fast, reliable power generation to our customers through integrated energy solutions,\" said Melissa Busen, senior vice president of Electric Power at Caterpillar Inc. \"We are proud to work with Joule and Wheeler to help bring this project to life.\"\n\n\"This strategic alliance between Joule, Caterpillar, and Wheeler brings together world-class engineering, local expertise, and visionary energy design\", said Bryan Campbell, CEO of Wheeler Machinery Co, \"We're proud to help deliver a resilient solution ready to meet future compute demands and set a new standard for data center infrastructure.\"\n\nAbout Joule \n\nJoule Capital Partners is helping to usher in the future of high-performance computing with a state-of-the-art, super-compute-ready campus spanning 4,000 acres in Central Utah, set to launch with gigawatt capacity in 2026. Designed specifically for AI-driven workloads, Joule integrates cutting-edge, reliable power generation with scalable infrastructure to deliver unmatched energy efficiency and compute density. By leveraging advanced Combined Cooling Heat and Power (CCHP) systems and innovative cooling solutions, Joule's campus is purpose-built to support the next generation of artificial intelligence and data-intensive applications, providing tenants with resilient, on-demand power and a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.
