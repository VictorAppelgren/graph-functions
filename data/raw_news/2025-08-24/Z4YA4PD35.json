  "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 The sole survivor of a deadly lunch laced with toxic mushrooms said on Monday he felt only half alive following the death of his wife and he continued to grieve the loss of his two closest friends.\n\nIan Wilkinson read the first victim impact statement in the Victoria state Supreme Court at the sentencing hearing of Erin Patterson.\n\nA jury convicted Patterson, 50, in July of murdering Wilkinson\u2019s wife Heather Wilkinson, her sister Gail Patterson, and her husband Don Patterson with a lunch of beef Wellington pastries and foraged death cap mushrooms in July 2023.\n\nErin Patterson was also convicted of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, who spent weeks in hospital and survived after receiving a liver transplant.\n\nWilkinson, a Baptist pastor, described his wife as a woman who took her faith seriously and was full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control.\n\n\u201cI only feel half alive without her,\u201d Wilkinson said before weeping.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the distressing shortcomings of our society that so much attention is showered on those who do evil and so little on those who do good,\u201d he added.\n\nHe described Gail and Don Patterson, the parents of Erin Patterson\u2019s estranged husband Simon Patterson, as the closest people to him after his wife and family.\n\n\u201cMy life is greatly impoverished without them,\u201d Wilkinson said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m distressed that Erin has acted with callous and calculated disregard for my life and the lives of those I love. What foolishness possesses a person to think that murder could be the solution to their problems, especially the murder of people who have only good intentions towards her?\u201d he added.\n\nWilkinson offered Patterson his forgiveness for the harms she had done to him.\n\n\u201cI say \u2018harms done to me\u2019 advisedly. I have no power or responsibility to forgive harms done to others,\u201d Wilkinson said.\n\n\u201cMy prayer for her is that she will use her time in jail wisely to become a better person,\u201d he added.\n\nErin Patterson attended the Melbourne court in person on Monday rather than watch via a video link from prison which she did during a hearing earlier this month. She wore a paisley top with a light brown jacket.\n\nSeven relatives of victims either read impact statements to the court on Monday or had them read on their behalf.\n\nThe sentencing hearing is scheduled to continue on Tuesday.\n\nShe faces a potential life sentence for each of the murders and 25 years for attempted murder.",

      "text": "Australian mushroom cook is convicted of triple murder after serving a fatal beef Wellington lunch\nAustralian woman Erin Patterson was Monday found guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Australian woman Erin Patterson was found guilty Monday of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.\nThe jury in the Supreme Court trial in Victoria state returned a verdict after six days of deliberations, following a nine-week trial that gripped Australia. Patterson faces life in prison and will be sentenced later, but a date for the hearing hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled.\nPatterson, who sat in the dock between two prison officers, showed no emotion but blinked rapidly as the verdicts were read.\nThree of Patterson\u2019s four lunch guests \u2014 her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson \u2014 died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.\nShe was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Heather\u2019s husband, who survived the meal.\nThe jury concluded she poisoned her guests on purpose\nIt wasn\u2019t disputed that Patterson served the mushrooms or that the pastries killed her guests. The jury was required to decide whether she knew the lunch contained death caps, and if she intended for them to die.\nThe guilty verdicts, which were required to be unanimous, indicated that jurors rejected Patterson\u2019s defense that the presence of the poisonous fungi in the meal was a terrible accident, caused by the mistaken inclusion of foraged mushrooms that she didn\u2019t know were death caps. Prosecutors didn\u2019t offer a motive for the killings, but during the trial highlighted strained relations between Patterson and her estranged husband and frustration that she had felt about his parents in the past.\nThe case turned on the question of whether Patterson meticulously planned a triple murder or accidentally killed three people she loved, including her children\u2019s only surviving grandparents. Her lawyers said she had no reason to do so \u2014 she had recently moved to a beautiful new home, was financially comfortable, had sole custody of her children and was due to begin studying for a degree in nursing and midwifery.\nBut prosecutors suggested Patterson had two faces \u2014 the woman who publicly appeared to have a good relationship with her parents-in-law, while her private feelings about them were kept hidden. Her relationship with her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal lunch but didn\u2019t go, deteriorated in the year before the deaths, the prosecution said.\nEvery moment of the fatal lunch was examined\nThe simplest facts of what happened that day and immediately afterward were hardly disputed. But Patterson\u2019s motivations for what she did and why were pored over in detail during the lengthy trial, at which more than 50 witnesses were called.\nThe individual beef Wellington pastries Patterson served her guests were one point of friction because the recipe she used contained directions for a single, family-sized portion. Prosecutors said that she reverted to individual servings, so she could lace the other diners\u2019 portions, but not her own, with the fatal fungi \u2014 but Patterson said that she was unable to find the correct ingredients to make the recipe as directed.\nNearly every other detail of the fateful day was scrutinized at length, including why Patterson sent her children out to a film before her guests arrived, why she added additional dried mushrooms to the recipe from her pantry, why she didn\u2019t become ill when the other diners did, and why she disposed of a food dehydrator after the deaths and told investigators that she didn\u2019t own one.\nPatterson acknowledged some lies during her evidence \u2014 including that she\u2019d never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator. But she said that those claims were made in panic as she realized her meal had killed people.\nShe said she didn\u2019t become as ill as the other diners since she vomited after the meal because of an eating disorder. She denied that she told her guests she had cancer as a ruse to explain why she invited them to her home that day.\nThe case gripped Australia\nThe bizarre and tragic case has lingered in the minds of Australians and has provoked fervor among the public and media. During the trial, five separate podcasts analyzed each day of the proceedings and several news outlets ran live blogs giving moment-by-moment accounts of more than two months of evidence.\nAt least one television drama and a documentary about the case are slated for production. Prominent Australian crime writers were seen in court throughout the trial.\nAs it emerged half an hour before the verdict that the court was reconvening, about 40 members of the public queued outside the courthouse in the rural town of Morwell in the hope of watching the outcome in person. News outlets reported that family members of the victims were not among those present.\nBefore the verdict, newspapers published photos of black privacy screens erected at the entrance to Erin Patterson\u2019s home. Dozens of reporters from throughout Australia and from news outlets abroad crowded around friends of Patterson\u2019s as they left the courthouse Monday.\n\u201cI\u2019m saddened, but it is what it is,\u201d said one friend, Ali Rose Prior, who wore sunglasses and fought back tears. Asked what she thought Patterson felt as the verdicts were read, Prior said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nPrior, who attended every day of the trial, confirmed Patterson had told her: \u201cSee you soon.\u201d Prior said she would visit her friend in prison.\n___\nGraham-McLay reported from Wellington, New Zealand."

      "text": "Woman who denies mushroom murders of her in-laws accepts that she served them death caps for lunch\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives with poisonous mushrooms told a court on Tuesday she accepted that the fatal lunch she served contained death caps.\nBut Erin Patterson said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the fungi came from local stores. She denies three counts of murder and one of attempted murder over the beef Wellington meal she served to her parents-in-law and her estranged husband\u2019s aunt and uncle at her home in July 2023.\nDon Patterson, Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson were hospitalized and died after the lunch in the rural town of Leongatha in the Australian state of Victoria. Heather\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, was gravely ill but survived.\nPatterson\u2019s lawyer earlier told the Supreme Court trial that the poisoning was a tragic accident but prosecutors said it was deliberate. If convicted, she faces a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder charges and 25 years in jail for attempted murder.\nLong queues formed outside the Latrobe Valley Courthouse on Tuesday after Patterson took the stand late Monday, which was the first time she had spoken publicly since the deaths.\nAccused foraged mushrooms for years\nDuring several hours of evidence on Tuesday, Patterson, 50, told the court she began foraging fungi during the COVID-19 lockdown of March 2020, witnessed only by her children.\n\u201cI cut a bit of one of the mushrooms, fried it up with some butter and ate it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tasted good and I didn\u2019t get sick.\u201d\nPatterson said she also fed foraged mushrooms to her children, chopped up \u201cvery, very small\u201d so they couldn\u2019t pick them out of curries, pasta and soups.\nShe developed a taste for exotic varieties, joined a \u201cmushroom lovers\u201d Facebook group, and bought a dehydrator to preserve her finds, Patterson said. Her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, asked if she accepted that the beef Wellington pastries she had served to her lunch guests in 2023 contained death caps.\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Patterson.\nThe accused told her lawyer most of the mushrooms she used that day came from local supermarkets. She agreed she might have put them in the same container as dehydrated wild mushrooms she had foraged weeks earlier and others from an Asian food store.\nMandy in April told the court his client had lied when she initially told investigators that she had never foraged before. But he denied that she had deliberately sought out death cap mushrooms and said she disposed of her dehydrator in a panic about the accidental deaths.\nRegrets over \u201cventing\u201d messages about in-laws\nEarlier Tuesday, Patterson became tearful when she was asked about expletive-filled messages she had sent about her in-laws in December 2022 in a Facebook group chat that she described as a \u201csafe venting space\u201d for a group of women.\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d never said it. I feel very ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn\u2019t have to hear that I said it,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\nPatterson, who said she had tried to have her parents-in-law mediate a dispute with her estranged husband, Simon, about school fees, said she was feeling hurt, frustrated and \u201ca little bit desperate.\u201d\nThe couple formally separated in 2015 after earlier temporary splits, the court has heard. Simon Patterson was invited to the July 2023 lunch but did not attend.\nAccused said she was still close with husband\u2019s family\nTuesday\u2019s evidence also traversed Patterson\u2019s health after prosecutors\u2019 suggestions that her lunch invitation was unusual and that she\u2019d organized it on a false pretense of receiving a cancer diagnosis. The mother of two admitted she never had cancer, but had been worried enough by symptoms to seek tests.\nDespite her separation from Simon, Patterson said she had hoped to reunite with her estranged husband and said she had remained close to her in-laws.\n\u201cIt never changed. I was just their daughter in law,\u201d said Patterson, through tears. \u201cThey just continued to love me.\u201d\nEvidence follows lengthy prosecution case\nThe 14-member jury has heard five weeks of prosecution evidence, including what the lunch guests told relatives before they died. Heather Wilkinson said shortly before she died that Patterson ate her individual beef wellington pastry from a different colored plate to the other diners, said prosecutor Nanette Rogers.\nOpening her case in April, Rogers said the poisoning was deliberate but that her case would not suggest a motive for the alleged killings. The prosecution says Patterson lied when she told investigators she had eaten the same meal as her guests and fed her children the leftovers.\nPatterson is due to continue giving evidence on Wednesday. Her evidence Tuesday did not include her account of the day of the lunch, or cross-examination from prosecutors."

      "text": "Husband suspected wife of poisoning him before she killed 3 relatives with toxic mushrooms\nHusband suspected wife of poisoning him before she killed 3 relatives with toxic mushrooms\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 The husband of a woman convicted of killing three people with a meal laced with deadly mushrooms suspected his wife had been poisoning him more than a year before the fatal meal, an Australian court has heard.\nA judge on Friday lifted a gag order on pretrial evidence that triple murderer Erin Patterson, 50, had wanted kept secret while she attempts to overturn her convictions.\nThe evidence included the suspicions of Patterson\u2019s estranged husband Simon Patterson that she had previously attempted to kill him.\nHusband says he feared estranged wife would poison him\nSimon Patterson testified at a pretrial hearing that he had declined the lunch invitation out of fear.\n\u201cI thought there\u2019d be a risk that she\u2019d poison me if I attended,\u201d the husband told the court months before the trial in testimony that was not presented to jurors.\nSimon said while he had stopped eating food prepared by his wife, from whom he had been estranged since 2015, he never thought others would be at risk.\nErin Patterson was convicted by the Victoria state Supreme Court last month of murdering her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson at her home in Leongatha with a lunch of beef Wellington pastries containing toxic death cap mushrooms.\nShe was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Heather\u2019s husband, who survived the meal but spent weeks in the hospital.\nErin Patterson was initially charged with attempting to murder her husband by inviting him to the lunch in July 2023. He had accepted the invitation then cancelled.\nShe was also initially charged with three counts of attempting to murder him on three occasions around Victoria between November 2021 and September 2022. She had denied all charges.\nProsecutors dropped all charges relating to the husband before her trial began in April.\nSimon Patterson testified before the trial that he suspected his wife had deliberately made him seriously ill with dishes including penne bolognese pasta, chicken korma curry and a vegetable curry wrap. No poisons were ever found.\nThe three alleged poisonings occurred during family camping trips. Simon shared his poisoning suspicions with his doctor, who encouraged him to create a spreadsheet listing what he had eaten around the time he became sick.\nThe court on Friday also released video of Erin Patterson\u2019s police interview, recorded a week after the fatal lunch.\nIn the interview, Detective Stephen Eppingstall told her that both her female victims were dead and their husbands were critically ill. Eppingstall asked her why she had invited them to lunch.\nErin Patterson replied that she wanted to maintain her relationship with the estranged husband\u2019s parents because her own parents had died.\nDon and Gail Patterson had remained supportive and had been the only grandparents to her two children, she said.\n\u201cI love them a lot. They\u2019ve always been really good to me and they always said to me that they would support me with love and emotional support, even though Simon and I were separated, and I really appreciated that,\u201d Erin Patterson said.\nDisclosures come as Patterson plans to appeal\nJustice Christopher Beale ruled for lawyers representing media who sought to overturn the gag order, ordering that the evidence that jurors had not seen would be made public.\nErin Patterson\u2019s lawyers wanted all the evidence that was not deemed admissible at her trial kept secret until an appeals court decided whether to overturn her convictions.\nTheir reasons included that media interest in the case was unprecedented. Defense lawyer Colin Mandy argued that reporting of the suppressed evidence as well as references to it in books, podcasts and a planned television mini-series would \u201cleave an indelible impression on the minds of potential jurors in the event that there is a retrial.\u201d\nA hearing will begin on Aug. 25 to determine what sentence she will get. She faces a potential life sentence for each of the murders and 25 years for attempted murder.\nProsecutor Jane Warren told Beale on Friday \u201ca lot\u201d of victim impact statements would be presented at that two-day sentencing hearing.\nOnce Erin Patterson is sentenced, she will have 28 days to lodge an appeal against the sentence, the convictions, or both.\nHer lawyers say they will appeal against her convictions."
