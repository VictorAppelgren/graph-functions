  "title": "Perplexity\u2019s bid to buy Chrome is likely more stunt than strategy",
  "description": "The AI search startup looks less like an acquirer and more like a company to be acquired, but its CEO understands that optics matter.",
  "content": "The bid comes as the Justice Department has asked a federal judge to require Google to sell off Chrome to end an ongoing antitrust case. But it\u2019s questionable that a startup valued at half that amount on paper ($18 billion) can afford to buy Chrome; and Google, of course, almost certainly has no intention of selling it\u2014at least not yet. Fast Company reached out to Google and Perplexity for comment. A federal court in Washington, D.C., decided last year that Google holds a monopoly in the internet search and advertising markets and is now considering a Department of Justice demand that the search giant sell off its Chrome browser. Google called the DOJ proposal \u201cwildly overbroad\u201d and part of a \u201cradical interventionist agenda\u201d (language that could draw some negative attention from the Trump administration).\n\nPerplexity testified in that same case last spring, at which time it expressed a desire to buy Chrome. OpenAI also testified, and its ChatGPT product lead, Nick Turley, also testified that his company would be interested in buying Chrome if the court required Google to sell. Indeed, owning the Chrome browser would immediately catapult Perplexity from being a longshot for winning, placing, or showing in the internet search wars, to being a real contender. Strategically, Perplexity could use the Chrome browser in the same way Google does\u2014as a widely popular front door to its AI-powered search engine.\n\nWith Chrome, Google fused the ideas of web browsing and web search into one thing that could be done in one place. Chrome changed the browser\u2019s URL to act as a search bar, too (the \u201comnibox,\u201d as it\u2019s called). A huge portion of Google searches come from Chrome, and Google makes the lion\u2019s share of its revenues from showing ads around search results. Google can place ads more effectively because of its access to all kinds of user browsing behavior in Chrome. Perplexity\u2019s bid, which it said would be financed by its venture investors, is very likely something less than a serious strategic gambit.\n\n\u201cThis is a clever publicity play by the startup, but no one should take this stunt seriously,\u201d says Neil Chilson, former FTC chief technologist and current head of AI policy at the Abundance Institute. Chilson adds that the bid will have no bearing on the remedies that Judge Amit Mehta is currently considering in the antitrust case. Perplexity is good at what it does, but still small Perplexity employs some very talented AI engineers, its \u201canswer engine\u201d product works surprisingly well by most accounts (including mine), and the company has been agile about releasing new products that augment its core service. (It recently released its own browser, called Comet.)\n\nBut in the face of Google Search, Perplexity is still small fry. It serves only a fraction of internet searches, and sends only a fraction of the product search referrals that go to brand websites. Perplexity looks more like a company to be acquired, not like an acquirer. Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, reportedly held talks to acquire Perplexity earlier this year, but an agreement couldn\u2019t be reached. It\u2019s likely that other suitors have approached the startup.\n\nAnd yet the existing rules of market dominance in tech could be shifting under everyone\u2019s feet\u2014because of generative AI. During this seminal period in the potentially transformative technology (when the next Googles and Apples may be being decided), optics matter. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas seems to have a keen sense of this. He knows he needs to keep his company\u2019s name in the conversation with other up-and-comers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, as the so-called AI revolution unfolds. He\u2019s done an admirable job of it\u2014as evidenced by his many podcasts, public appearances, and viral tweets. So Perplexity\u2019s Chrome bid may come out of the same playbook. It\u2019s about posturing.",
