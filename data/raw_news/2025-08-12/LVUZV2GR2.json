      "text": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to meet with President Donald Trump on Thursday as major geopolitical issues ranging from war in Europe, the Middle East and massive trade disputes are expected to be discussed.\nGermany and the Trump administration, both during his first term and again upon re-election, have butted heads with both sides expressing public frustration with one another.\nBut recent positive chats between Merz and Trump suggest the meeting on Thursday will remain cordial as Berlin looks to make headway when it comes to lifting Trump\u2019s 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts, as well as the existing 10% tariff on all goods, which was temporarily lowered from 20% earlier this year.\nGERMANY'S CHANCELLOR ENDS WEAPONS RANGE LIMITS FOR UKRAINE DESPITE RUSSIAN NUCLEAR THREATS\nThe trip to D.C. this week is Merz\u2019s first since becoming chancellor last month, and comes as European nations have increasingly banded together following Trump\u2019s geopolitical positions regarding trade and defense since re-entering the White House.\nNations like France and the U.K. have successfully toed the line when it comes to maintaining a relationship with Washington under the Trump presidency, while also drastically expanding relations to decrease future dependence on the U.S.\nGermany\u2019s Merz is also expected to attempt to strike this balance \u2013 a strategy he said he had already begun working on when speaking with German media earlier this week.\nTRUMP EFFECT FORCES GERMANY TO REPRIORITIZE DEFENSE AS NATION PLAYS CATCH-UP IN MILITARY SPENDING\n\"It's always important that you don't talk for too long, but that you talk for a moment and let him talk too\", Merz told German outlet WDR. \"You have to adapt to him and get involved with him \u2013 and at the same time you can't make yourself smaller than we are.\n\"That's my most important requirement anyway, that we can talk to him sensibly: We're not supplicants,\" he added.\nBut despite efforts to bolster relations with Trump from afar, Oval Office meetings with the president are anything but predictable, as witnessed by the explosive interaction during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s February visit, as well as when the president accused South African President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s government of committing \"genocide\" last month, though no party in South Africa, including the party that represents the Afrikaners, have substantiated these claims.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOne area where Merz could earn points with Trump is when it comes NATO defense spending and the president\u2019s push for nations to not only increase spending on defense to the 2% threshold, but to spend 5% GDP on defense \u2013 a push the U.S. is not yet close to achieving.\nWhile Germany does spend more than 2% of its GDP on defense, Merz has backed the call to spend up to 5%, and he could use this to rally Trump to increase his support for Kyiv, and push for greater European involvement in future peace talks."

Meanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party (SPD) won just 16.4% of the vote, its worst result since World War II.\nFox News Digital's Rachel Wolf and Reuters contributed to this report."

There are several steps one must take to become a U.S. citizen, which are outlined on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. These steps include preparing an application for naturalization, paying fees, completing an interview and taking the oath of allegiance to the United States.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration prioritized securing the border and cracking down on the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the country. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws. Since beginning his second term in the White House, Trump has worked to initiate the deportation of undocumented immigrants.\nThousands of people gathered in downtown Los Angeles for protest demonstrations over immigration. The scene turned from peaceful to violent as rising unrest prompted police to deploy tear gas. The Los Angeles immigration protests were among other nationwide protests against federal immigration raids conducted by ICE agents. California Gov. has continued to blame Trump for the escalating protests, claiming that they were peaceful demonstrations before the National Guard and Trump's rhetoric intensified the conflict.\n\u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the nation's newest detention facility for undocumented immigrants, is located in the Florida Everglades and surrounded by swampland teeming with alligators and pythons. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized the construction of the detention center on a 30-square-mile property in the swamplands of Miami-Dade County under an emergency order in June 2025. The property, a former airport, has been outfitted with sturdy tent structures to house 5,000 undocumented immigrants amid the Trump administration's deportation blitz to remove the millions of migrants who entered the country during the Biden administration."
