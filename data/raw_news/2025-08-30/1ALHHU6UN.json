  "title": "Brooks Nader on why she was \u2018crying in bed\u2019 after Gleb Savchenko split \u2014 while he did this \u2018dumb\u2019 activity",
  "description": "\u201cThe biggest takeaway from the whole breakup was how my sisters rallied around me,\u201d the star gushed.",
  "content": "Brooks Nader isn\u2019t tap dancing around what happened with her ex.\n\nAfter meeting on Season 33 of \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d in 2024, the model, 28, and Gleb Savchenko, 41, struck up a partnership both in and out of the ballroom.\n\nNader and the dance pro were involved in an eight-month on-again, off-again romance that ended for good in April 2025.\n\nThe reality star accused Savchenko of cheating on her. The Post reached out to the competition star\u2019s rep for comment.\n\nWhile going through the breakup, Nader had her family by her side, including her three sisters: Mary Holland, Grace Ann and Sarah Jane.\n\nAlong with her ride-or-dies, there was also a production team in tow, capturing the split on camera for the sisters\u2019 new reality series \u201cLove Thy Nader.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was hard to mums the word while he was just making dumb TikToks and I was crying in bed,\u201d Nader exclusively told The Post.\n\nWith headlines swirling, the Louisiana native and her family chose to stay silent for the most part.\n\n\u201cThere is a moment where I was having fun at an event and honestly didn\u2019t know the cameras were right there. And someone said something, and I replied out of emotion,\u201d Sarah Jane recalled. \u201cBasically, there were some \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 fans at this event, and they were like, \u2018We were obsessed with you and Gleb.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018We hate Gleb.'\u201d\n\n\u201cBut nobody knew about it, and I was going, \u2018Okay, yeah. That\u2019s great. We\u2019ll take a photo,'\u201d reminisced the cover star. \u201c[I was] keeping on a brave face, and I told the girls, \u2018Don\u2019t say anything. We need to be professional, and this is my work event.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018We hate him. He cheated on her!'\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell these girls anything, but they know everything,\u201d she teased, referring to her sisters.\n\nSometimes, it was just difficult not to defend their sister to the press or otherwise.\n\n\u201cDefinitely when all the cheating stuff was happening and comments and headlines were blaming Brooks for using it to spin our show or somehow promote our show, that was really hurtful,\u201d Mary Holland explained. \u201cBecause we were in the midst of showing it on the show, but we couldn\u2019t talk about it. So watching her go through that was really hard. But it\u2019ll all come out in the wash. Tune in to \u2018Love Thy Nader\u2019 to see what really happened.\u201d\n\nAfter taking a beat from Savchenko, Nader reflected on what the split taught her.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest takeaway from the whole breakup was how my sisters rallied around me,\u201d she gushed.\n\n\u201cMy mom, my dad and how they were there for me. And I think it\u2019s kind of ironic and funny, like my dad gave me away. He thought I was married. He thought he was done with me. And then it\u2019s like, no, I\u2019m going to be licking face on television with this dancer, then date him, then be on a reality show, then date other [people],\u201d joked Nader.\n\n\u201cBut no, they\u2019re so supportive,\u201d she reiterated. \u201cThey were really there for me when I was not getting out of bed for like three days when this was all going down in real life. It was special to see how they came to my bedside and they were so sweet. My parents stayed in town, and extended an extra day, and they\u2019re just so sweet, I could cry.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Savchenko hinted that he was fired from \u201cDWTS\u201d after Nader\u2019s cheating allegations. Savchenko originally joined the cast of the ABC series in 2013 for Season 16.\n\nDespite the rocky relationship ending, filming \u201cLove Thy Nader,\u201d which airs on Freeform and Hulu, was a blessing for the sisters.\n\n\u201cIt definitely brought us closer,\u201d said Mary Holland.\n\nNader echoed her sibling\u2019s sentiments, elaborating, \u201cWe got closer. We\u2019ve pulled out. There was blood drawn. There was tears. There was everything. Pregnancy tests. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but you just name it and it happened. I feel that\u2019s sort of a look into truly our daily lives. My dad says, \u2018There\u2019s always 50 things happening at once.\u2019 So I feel like they did a great job of showing our daily lives.\u201d\n\nBefore moving to the Big Apple with her family, Brooks was married to Billy Haire. The Sports Illustrated model and the real estate investor split in May 2024, and their divorce was finalized a year later.\n\n\u201cThe biggest adjustment, I think, was for me being married all those years and then moving back in with my sisters was like, whoa. But I think for the better,\u201d confessed Nader. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream, really. Built in besties. I mean, they\u2019re just right there. They\u2019re a scream away.\u201d\n\nAlong with the dramatics that will play out on the show, fans will also get a look into the Naders\u2019 southern roots.\n\n\u201cYou guys really get to see how we get into it with the crawfish and the sucking of the heads and the eating of the tails. I mean, we go gnarly. I can eat my weight in crawfish. I don\u2019t think people know that about me,\u201d admitted Nader. \u201cBut you\u2019ll see me throw down a few pounds in a few minutes on the show.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say filming has given the ladies a sense of freedom to be themselves.\n\n\u201cTotally,\u201d Nader concurred. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re going to be on reality TV. We\u2019re putting it all out there. So everything is fair game to make fun of.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove Thy Nader\u201d airs every Tuesday on Freeform. The entire season is currently streaming on Hulu.",

And it showed through the dress. But you live and learn from experience.\u201d"

It\u2019s really fun.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s safe to say Savchenko, 41, is in sync with his partner. In fact, the professional dancer revealed what Nader has taught him on this journey.\n\u201cDon\u2019t take away the fun,\u201d Savchenko expressed. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the balance, and I actually love it. I\u2019ve never done anything like that when I am working on a season. I am a very strict teacher, and it\u2019s a very hardcore Russian school. But with her, I have a lot of fun.\u201d\nAlthough the duo\u2019s time together hasn\u2019t been all fun and games.\n\u201cI had a lot of injuries,\u201d Nader confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard being a ballroom dancer, and your body goes through so much, and I am not used to that.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cI feel like I was pleasantly surprised with how my body was able to adapt to the changes. We had a few little rib moments and bruises, but we worked through it together, and overcame the odds, and got really good scores.\u201d\nTheir cha-cha to \u201cNothin\u2019 But a Good Time\u201d by Poison earned them eights from judges Derek Hough, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli. However, when it came to guest judge Gene Simmons, he tried giving the duo a 10 but locked in a nine instead. The total for Nader and Savchenko was 33/40.\nBut the choreographer is dancing around the technicality.\n\u201cWe just say this is the first 10 of the season, and that was us,\u201d Savchenko stated, before Nader replied, \u201cWe made history this season. The first 10. We\u2019re still counting it.\u201d\nSavchenko and Nader\u2019s high scores came a day after their PDA-filled night at a tattoo shop in Los Angeles.\nAccording to photos obtained by Page Six, the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d partners were getting handsy during an ink session in Hollywood, Calif.\nAt one point, Nader and a shirtless Savchenko had their arms wrapped around each other and shared a passionate kiss inside the tattoo shop.\nThe Russian native also leaned over to kiss the star on the lips before kissing her neck while she was lying on the table, getting a tattoo on her lower abdomen.\nSavchenko got his own ink on his side, with photos showing Nader straddling him when he was on the tattoo table.\nThe \u201cDWTS\u201d partners previously got candid about whether their intense chemistry in the ballroom makes it hard for them to focus on the craft.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nader, 27, revealed to The Post in September. \u201cI think that in both our industries, we\u2019re always around beautiful, gorgeous people, and you just have to keep your eye on the prize and focus on dance.\u201d\nSavchenko shared that their main goal is \u201ccompeting for the Mirrorball.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re super focused on the Mirrorball, getting into the finals and, look, like Brooks said, it\u2019s important to have good energy in the room because when you\u2019re not, they can see you\u2019re not vibing with each other; it\u2019s really hard.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cYou have to want to be physically close up to the person, with that person. We have that, [we\u2019re] vibing, it makes it so much easier.\u201d\n\u201cIt helps a lot,\u201d Nader agreed. \u201cImagine being this close to somebody you hate all day.\u201d"

She joined the sketch comedy juggernaut during Season 43 as a featured player before being promoted to the main cast in 2019.\nSome of her most memorable characters showed up on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d including teen movie critic Bailey Gismert and Angel, \u201cevery boxer\u2019s girlfriend from every movie about boxing ever.\u201d\nOne of her biggest moments came last year when she cracked while playing a news anchor leading a town hall who is upstaged by audience members who look exactly like Beavis and Butt-Head.\nGardner\u2019s departure marks the fourth performer to exit the series this week, behind Michael Longfellow, Emil Wakim and Devon Walker, following Lorne Michaels\u2019 promise of a massive cast shake-up.\nThe Post reached out to Gardner\u2019s rep and \u201cSNL\u201d for comment.\nAs of recent years, the star has branched out from the comedy scene, starring alongside Harrison Ford and Jason Segel as Grace in \u201cShrinking\u201d for Seasons 1 and 2.\nShe also appeared in an episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cYou\u201d during its final season, the sitcom \u201cGirls5eva\u201d and Adam Sandler\u2019s 2022 basketball movie \u201cHustle.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Gardner hinted at her possible exit while speaking to comedian Craig Ferguson on his podcast, \u201cJoy.\u201d\nDuring the episode, she admitted that the job had become a \u201clittle tough.\u201d\n\u201cI will say, the only thing that I\u2019ve started to feel a little bit is just sketch fatigue, or idea fatigue,\u201d the star explained. \u201cAt this point, after doing Groundlings and \u2018SNL\u2019 for so long, I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019ve written a lot of sketches.\u2019\u201d\nHours before Gardner\u2019s departure, The Post confirmed that Michael Longfellow would also be leaving \u201cSNL\u201d after his three-year tenure on the show.\nHe had just been upped to the main cast for last year\u2019s Season 50.\nLongfellow and Gardner\u2019s former co-stars Devon Walker and Emil Wakim, meanwhile, confirmed their exits from the show earlier this week.\nWalker, 34, announced his departure on Monday night after three seasons. Like Longfellow, he joined the cast as a featured player in 2022 and was promoted to the main cast in 2024.\n\u201cMe and the show did three years together, and sometimes it was really cool,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cSometimes it was toxic as hell. But we \u2026 made the most of what it was, even amidst all of the dysfunction. We made a f\u2013ked up lil family.\u201d\nWakim, an \u201cSNL\u201d newcomer who was only on the show for a single season, said in his own Instagram post Wednesday that being let go \u201cwas a gut punch of a call to get.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the most terrifying, thrilling, and rewarding experience of my life,\u201d he added, \u201cand I will miss it dearly and all the brilliant people that work there that made it feel like a home.\u201d\nWriters Celeste Yim and Rosebud Baker, too, have revealed their exits from the show.\nYim, who joined the \u201cgrueling\u201d program five years ago, was the first to announce their departure over the weekend.\n\u201cAfter five seasons, I\u2019m leaving my job at Saturday Night Live,\u201d they wrote on Instagram on Sunday.\nThe surprising and ongoing \u201cSNL\u201d exodus kicked off shortly after Michaels hinted at some cast changes in an interview with Puck News published Friday, Aug. 22.\nMichaels, 80, replied \u201cYes\u201d when asked if he plans to \u201cshake things up\u201d for Season 51.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be announced in a week or so,\u201d he added."

At the time, Archie was just 3 years old, while Lilibet was 1.\nHarry previously insisted that having his family join him on future trips to the UK was simply not an option without \u201cfull police protection\u201d \u2014 for which he lost his appeal earlier this year.\nIn the same interview, the Invictus Games founder told the BBC that he would \u201clove a reconciliation\u201d with his estranged father, though he claimed the king \u201cwon\u2019t speak\u201d to him.\n\u201cThere have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family,\u201d he said in May.\n\u201cI would love reconciliation with my family. There\u2019s no point continuing to fight anymore, life is precious,\u201d Harry said, adding that he has since \u201cforgiven\u201d them for their many \u201cdisagreements.\u201d"
