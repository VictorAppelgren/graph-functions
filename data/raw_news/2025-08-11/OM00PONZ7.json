  "content": "The Genius Electric Mixer Trick We Wish We'd Known About Sooner originally appeared on Parade.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever pulled out your hand mixer and ended up with a kitchen counter sprinkled in powdered sugar, flour or frosting splatter, you\u2019re not alone. Mixing can get messy, especially when you\u2019re working with lighter ingredients or higher speeds. Sure, a stand mixer helps, but it can be heavy to lug out, complicated to clean and not everyone has one.\n\nThat\u2019s why when Lora McLaughlin Peterson (@Lorafied), one of our favorite content creators, shared a simple yet brilliant electric mixer trick on Instagram, we took notice. It\u2019s one of those \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d hacks that can make a huge difference in your daily kitchen life.\n\nRelated: The Clever Paper Towel Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b SIGN UP to get delicious recipes, handy kitchen hacks & more in our daily Pop Kitchen newsletter. \ud83c\udf73\ud83c\udf54\n\nThis clever hack is simple but effective. All you need is a thin cutting board with a handle, your hand mixer and the bowl of whatever you\u2019re mixing.\n\nStart by placing the handle opening of the cutting board over the holes where the beater attachments plug into your hand mixer. Insert the beaters through the hole to attach them to the mixer. Place the cutting board over the mixing bowl so the beaters drop down inside. The board should rest on top of the bowl like a lid.\n\nTurn on your mixer and mix away. (Be sure to stay next to the mixer though, in case things get wobbly. ) The cutting board turns a hand mixer into a stand mixer of sorts and also acts like a splash guard, catching any rogue bits of powdered sugar or batter that would normally fling out.\n\nRelated: The Clever Coffee Filter Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner\n\nWhy This Trick Is So Smart and Some Extra Tips\n\nThe brilliance of this hack is in how it turns a hand mixer into a DIY stand mixer, saving you the trouble of lugging out the bulky mixer or maybe saving you the cost of buying one at all. If you were considering buying a splash guard accessory for your mixer, this takes the place of that, too.\n\nBefore trying this hack, make sure you have the right cutting board. A thin (but not too thin) cutting board with a large enough handle hole works best. Thick boards could be too heavy and may block your view of the mixture. Thin, flexible plastic cutting boards aren't sturdy enough for this task. In the video, it looks like Peterson is using a thin bamboo cutting board, which are widely available.\n\nAlso, be sure to mind the bowl size. This works best with large mixing bowls that have wide openings so the board can rest securely on top.\n\nThis trick is great for messy recipes. Frostings, whipped cream, buttercream, cake batters and anything involving powdered sugar or cocoa powder benefit most from this splash guard setup.\n\nRelated: The Genius Plastic Bag Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner\n\nPros and Cons of the Cutting Board Mixer Hack\n\nLike all kitchen hacks, this one has its strengths and limitations.\n\nIt is great for mess control, sure. No more cleaning powdered sugar or cake batter off your backsplash! Plus, it's budget-friendly because it uses items you already have.\n\nAlso, cutting boards are a breeze to wash compared to bulky mixer attachments, and this hack works for many types of bowls and recipes.\n\nUnfortunately, if your cutting board handle is too small, your beaters won\u2019t fit. You may also need to buy a board with a hole if you don't have one of those (but they're cheap).\n\nIt's also a slightly awkward setup that may take a few tries to line up the handle hole with the bowl center and you can\u2019t always see the mixture as clearly until you remove the board.\n\nStill, for the occasional baker (or the frequent one tired of wiping down the kitchen every time they make frosting), this little trick is worth adding to your repertoire. It\u2019s proof that sometimes the best kitchen upgrades aren\u2019t about buying more tools. They\u2019re about reimagining the ones you already own.\n\nRelated: The Genius Greek Yogurt Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner\n\nThe Genius Electric Mixer Trick We Wish We'd Known About Sooner first appeared on Parade on Aug 11, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Aug 11, 2025, where it first appeared.",

      "text": "The Clever Paper Towel Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner\nThe Clever Paper Towel Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner originally appeared on Parade.\nSome cleaning tips seem so obvious in hindsight that you can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t think of them earlier. That\u2019s exactly how I felt after watching content creator @smalltowninfluencer share her brilliant hack for cleaning sticky messes off your kitchen tools.\n\u201cSeems like everyone should know this,\u201d she said in the caption of her video, \u201cbut weirdly, a lot of people don\u2019t!!\u201d It\u2019s simple, effective and just makes sense. Did you know about this? Read on to find out.\nRelated:The Supersmart Kitchen Sponge Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner\n\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b SIGN UP to get delicious recipes, handy kitchen hacks & more in our daily Pop Kitchen newsletter. \ud83c\udf73\ud83c\udf54\nWhy This Paper Towel Hack Is Just Plain Smart\nIf you\u2019ve ever washed something like a cheese grater or a bowl coated in dough, you already know how annoying it is. Cheese gets wedged into the holes of your grater. Dough turns into a paste on your spoon. And somehow all of it ends up in your sponge, which instantly becomes gross and unusable. That\u2019s where this trick shines. Just use a paper towel to wipe away the worst of the gunk.\nToday\u2019s paper towels are strong enough to handle the job. One quick swipe gets rid of the majority of the mess before it even touches your sink. Think of it as \u201cpre-cleaning.\" You\u2019re removing the thick, sticky layer so that your sponge (or dishwasher) can handle the rest without struggling. This method cuts down on the gunk going into your sponge, which keeps your sponge cleaner, your hands less gross and your dishes easier to manage.\nYou also avoid clogging up your sink or dishwasher filter with large, sticky food bits. That saves you from yet another round of scrubbing later. Win-win-win!\nRelated:The Supersmart Viral Paper Towel Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner\nMore Tips for Using This Trick\nThis paper towel trick works especially well on cheese graters (both box and handheld styles), mixing bowls coated in dough or batter, utensils with thick, sticky sauces or melted cheese, spatulas and whisks used for peanut butter or marshmallows (looking at you, Rice Krispies Treats) and pastry cutters or bench scrapers.\nIt\u2019s also a great trick for those moments when something\u2019s half-dried on and you know water alone won\u2019t budge it without some serious effort. One swipe with a paper towel can loosen that residue enough to make washing much quicker.\nWhen is this not the best idea? If you're dealing with items that are hot or greasy, a paper towel might not hold up. And of course, this doesn\u2019t take the place of proper washing. But as a first step? It can seriously cut down your dishwashing time and keep your sponge from turning into a gluey nightmare.\nIf you want to take things a step further, try keeping a roll of reusable cleaning cloths nearby. They're machine washable, sturdier than paper towels and still great for that initial wipe-down. You\u2019ll get all the benefits of this hack, with a little less waste.\nIt\u2019s always the smallest tweaks that change the way you clean. This quick tip is one of those hacks you\u2019ll start using immediately and never stop. Because no one wants to deal with a sponge full of dough.\nUp Next:\nRelated: The Clever Coffee Filter Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner\nThe Clever Paper Towel Trick We Wish We\u2019d Known About Sooner first appeared on Parade on Jun 23, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Jun 23, 2025, where it first appeared."
