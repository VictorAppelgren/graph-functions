  "description": "New data from Seniorly reveals that seniors in 41 states risk outliving savings. New York tops the list with a $448K deficit. See where your state ranks.",
  "content": "A new analysis from Seniorly has put the American retirement crisis into black-and-white numbers. On a national basis, seniors in 41 of the 50 states, along with those in Washington, D.C., are projected to outlive their savings. Specifically, Seniorly sees those seniors falling short of their retirement needs by an average of $115,000.\n\nRead Next: 50 Cheapest Places To Retire Across America\n\nExplore More: These Cars May Seem Expensive, but They Rarely Need Repairs\n\nUnfortunately, this is the stark reality that many Americans are facing when it comes to retirement. But as bad as these stats from Seniorly are, things are even worse in the great state of New York.\n\nAlso see how long $1 million in retirement will last in every state.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Deficit in New York?\n\nAccording to Seniorly, New York is No. 1 in the nation when it comes to coming up short in terms of retirement needs. The average senior in New York is expected to face a $448,000 shortfall in retirement. Total expenses are projected at $1.12 million, but retirement income is only $670,000 on average, according to the data.\n\nNew York is not the most expensive state. In fact, four other states (as well as Washington, D.C.) have higher projected expenses:\n\nBut New York is still tops in terms of a retirement savings deficit because incomes are higher in these locations. Hawaii, for example, has the highest total retirement income in the nation, at $1.32 million. That\u2019s almost double the income in New York, resulting in the disparity.\n\nHowever, Hawaii still ranks No. 2 in terms of a retirement deficit for its seniors. Massachusetts, California and Washington, D.C., rank No. 6, No. 5 and No. 3, respectively.\n\nCheck Out: 25 Cities Where You Can Retire in Great Weather for $2,000 a Month\n\nWhat States Have the Biggest Cushions?\n\nResults of the study vary from state to state, but the bottom line is that only nine states have an average income that exceeds the average expenses in retirement.\n\nHow Can You Secure Your Retirement?\n\nThe good thing about retirement projections is that they are just that \u2014 projections. While you can\u2019t control every variable when it comes to retirement planning, you can greatly increase your chances for outliving your money. Here are some important steps, according to Seniorly:\n\u2022 Use tools: There are plenty of online calculators that can help you determine how long your savings will last. Play with different variables, such as your investment return, longevity and expenses, to see how they can affect your overall outcome.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t assume you\u2019re average: No one understands your lifestyle needs better than you do. While the state-by-state averages can be a starting place, tweak that data based on your own personal real-world income and expenses to get a more accurate projection.\n\u2022 Optimize your Social Security strategy: You might want to consider working with a financial professional to help you choose the best time to claim your Social Security benefits.\n\u2022 Factor in unexpected expenses: Income, investment returns and expenses are all variables that may not come in exactly where you project. To help cover unexpected costs that could otherwise derail your financial plan, build an emergency fund and consider additional insurance, such as long-term care and/or umbrella policies.\n\u2022 Talk about your plan: Whether it\u2019s with your spouse, significant other, adult children or financial advisor, bouncing your plan off someone can provide you with insights you might overlook in terms of how your strategy might meet your needs.",

      "text": "10 Steps To Help You Prepare for Retirement\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIf your idea of the perfect retirement is to enjoy leisurely mornings, you\u2019ll need to start preparing ahead of time. Retirement planning starts while you\u2019re still working. No matter how old you are, now is the perfect time to create a savings plan to help you retire comfortably.\nTo ease the process of planning for retirement, it\u2019s a good idea to break it down into some basic steps. You\u2019ll start by creating a vision of your retirement lifestyle, helping turn it over the years as you build your savings. Let\u2019s dig into the need-to-know, essential details for proper retirement planning.\n1. Start Saving Now\nEven if you are fresh out of high school, it\u2019s never too early to start saving for retirement. A good first step is looking at the different savings plans available.\nOne option is to open a high-yield savings account dedicated to your retirement savings. Many Americans rely on company-sponsored 401(k) plans to build retirement savings. Other options include:\n- One-participant 401(k)s if you are a business owner with no employees\n- 403(b)s\n- Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs)\n- Roth IRAs\n- SIMPLE IRAs\n2. Contribute to Your Employer\u2019s Retirement Savings Plan\nIf your employer offers a 401(k) plan or other retirement plan, sign up and contribute. This is the best and easiest way to start building a retirement fund. When you use an employer-sponsored plan, your employer handles the heavy lifting. All you have to do is agree to have money deducted from your paycheck every pay cycle. You also get tax advantages. And if your employer matches your contribution, you get free money that goes into your retirement savings.\nIn 2025, employees can contribute up to $23,500 in their:\n- 401(k)\n- 403(b)\n- 457 plans\n- The federal government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan\n3. Find Out About Your Employer\u2019s Pension Plan\nMany government employers offer a traditional pension plan rather than a 401(k) plan. If your employer offers a pension plan, find out if you\u2019re covered. You can ask for an individual benefit statement to understand your pension\u2019s value and ensure you know what\u2019s happening with your benefits before changing jobs.\n4. Invest In an IRA\nIf you don\u2019t have access to a 401(k) or pension plan, you should start investing in an IRA to build your nest egg. IRAs offer tax benefits that bolster your retirement savings over time. Even if you have a company-sponsored plan, invest in an IRA to save faster. Keep in mind that the maximum you can contribute to an IRA in 2025 is $7,000 a year.\nHowever, you get an additional \u201ccatch-up\u201d contribution of $1,000 to bring the total to $8,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older.\n5. Balance Your Portfolio\nSaving money for retirement is only part of your overall strategy. You also need to make sure your investments have the right mix of:\n- Stocks\n- Bonds\n- Mutual funds\n- ETFs\n- Real estate\n- Other assets\nSpreading your investments across diverse assets can mitigate risk and produce steady returns over time.\n6. Don\u2019t Touch Your Retirement Savings\nIt\u2019s important to never dip into these accounts unless you\u2019re facing a financial emergency. Taking loans and early withdrawals from your retirement savings can set your retirement plans back years. For example, if your 401(k) plan allows you to take a loan, you\u2019ll be required to repay it \u2014 including interest \u2014 according to strict terms. If you don\u2019t adhere to these requirements, any unpaid amounts will become a plan distribution.\nIn most cases, you\u2019ll have to include any previously untaxed amount of the distribution in your gross income the year the distribution occurred. You might also face an additional 10% tax on the amount of the taxable distribution.\n7. Set Retirement Goals\nOnce you have done the early planning, you should set a target age for retirement. Some people choose to continue working well into their 60s and 70s, especially if they enjoy your work. Others prefer to step out of the workforce to travel or spend time with loved ones while they are still in good health.\nYou\u2019ll also need to envision your ideal retirement lifestyle. Things to consider include:\n- Where you\u2019ll live\n- How much your lifestyle will cost\n- Whether you need to earn extra money through a part-time job or side gig\n8. Determine How Much Money You\u2019ll Need\nA big part of enjoying retirement is having enough money to live your ideal lifestyle. The U.S. Department of Labor recommends having 70% to 90% of your income to maintain your current standard of living. If you\u2019re currently earning $60,000 per year, you\u2019ll likely need $42,000 to $54,000 per year in retirement, or $3,500 to $4,500 per month.\nIf you think Social Security will cover most of this cost, you\u2019re probably mistaken. As of May 2025, the average Social Security retirement benefit was about $2,002 a month, according to the Social Security Administration. That\u2019s not nearly enough to cover the average living costs in the United States.\nTo help you formulate a good savings goal, look at the retirement calculator from GOBankingRates. You can use it to determine how much you might need to save for retirement. To figure out the right amount, it will use factors such as:\n- Retirement age\n- Savings\n- Income\n9. Familiarize Yourself With Social Security Benefits\nYou can start claiming Social Security benefits as early as age 62. However, delaying your claim can increase your monthly payments. The full retirement age is when you qualify for full benefits. That\u2019s considered 66 or 67 depending on when you were born.\nAfter age 70, there\u2019s no financial benefit to delaying further. To be eligible for Social Security retirement benefits, you need a minimum of 10 years of work, equivalent to 40 credits. Your benefit amount is calculated based on your 35 highest-earning years.\n10. Hire a Professional\nPlanning for retirement is not just about setting aside money for the future. You should develop an investment strategy that maximizes your returns and helps build an adequate nest egg for your golden years. This involves:\n- Understanding different investments\n- Managing risk\n- Planning for a long retirement to ensure you don\u2019t run out of money\n- Learning the tax laws and how best to navigate them\nIf you have the resources, you should hire a financial advisor. They can help you put together the best plan for your personal financial situation and retirement goals.\nWhat Should I Do 5 Years Before Retirement?\nIf you\u2019re retirement planning for the next five years, you\u2019re probably getting excited for this new chapter. Many of the decisions you make now can have a lasting impact on your retirement lifestyle. This period and the first five years after retirement are known as the fragile decade.\nYou want to ensure you\u2019re taking the right steps now to ensure a smooth financial transition into your golden years. Some actions to take include:\n- Maximize all of your retirement accounts if you can do so.\n- Take a close look at your current budget. Pay down as much debt as possible.\n- Consider purchasing supplemental coverage to assist with medical costs.\n- If you haven\u2019t already, reach out to a fee-only financial planner to make sure your investment plan is on track.\n- Decide exactly where you\u2019ll live and use this to determine your estimated cost of living.\n- Take a closer look at your estimated Social Security monthly benefit.\n- If you don\u2019t already, make sure you have an emergency fund in place, so you don\u2019t have to take extra money out of a taxable retirement fund or get a job if you\u2019re faced with an unexpected major expense.\nFinal Take To GO\nIt\u2019s never too early or too late to start planning for retirement. The more time you spend thinking about the kind of life you want and taking steps to prepare for it now, the more likely you are to enjoy your golden years.\nEven if retirement is a long way away, today\u2019s actions will hugely impact your future. Opening a retirement savings account and contributing a portion of each paycheck might mean you have to sacrifice a bit now, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the amount you\u2019ll have to stretch your budget in retirement without proper savings.\nAllison Hache and Jennifer Taylor contributed to the reporting for this article."

Yet a third (32%) of retirees say they don\u2019t have enough money to last through retirement, according to a 2024 survey by Schroders.\nIndeed, the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances found that roughly half of Americans have nothing saved for retirement at all.\nEven those who think they have enough may be in for a rude awakening. Consider the following reasons your nest egg may need more padding before you call the job quits.\nHigher Future Tax Rates\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects a federal budget deficit of $1.6 trillion in 2024, and the federal debt rising from 99% of GDP in 2024 to 116% by 2034.\nPoliticians love to spend today and let someone else worry about the bill tomorrow. Unfortunately, that \u201csomeone else\u201d isn\u2019t just their successor in office \u2014 you and I will pay the bill sooner or later, in the form of higher taxes.\nThat could mean higher rates on existing types of taxes, such as income taxes. Or it could mean the government creating new types of taxes to add to our existing tax burden.\n\u201cUncertainty around future income tax rates and proper tax planning is a major consideration for retirement savings,\u201d explains Thomas Schulte, a Certified Financial Planner and partner at Napier Financial. \u201cWhile large pre-tax retirement accounts certainly help, they come with large income tax bills upon distribution.\n\u201cRetirees and soon-to-be retirees should always be asking: What can I do now to be as efficient as possible from a tax perspective?\u201d Consider contributing to Roth accounts instead of traditional retirement accounts, and doing Roth conversions to move your existing funds from a traditional to a Roth account.\nInflation: The Silent Tax\nWhen governments get into trouble paying their debts, most don\u2019t default. They simply let inflation run rampant and reduce the value of their debts.\n\u201cRising inflation can quickly erode the purchasing power of your savings,\u201d notes Erika Kullberg, personal finance expert and founder of Erika.com. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen especially in recent years, inflation can make everyday purchases far more expensive over time.\u201d\nEven a \u201chealthy\u201d inflation rate saps your savings when you plan in decades. Tom Buckingham, an actuary and chief growth officer for Nassau Financial Group, notes, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much more than 2% annual inflation for the cost of goods to double over 30 years.\u201d\nTomorrow\u2019s dollar won\u2019t stretch as far as you think, so invest more than you think you need.\nLonger Than Expected Longevity\nWe all assume we\u2019ll live a roughly average lifespan. But life expectancies form a bell curve \u2014 and plenty of people fall on the right-hand side of it.\n\u201cMany people underestimate how long they might live,\u201d observes Buckingham. \u201cAnd that risk is even higher for a married couple. At least one of two 65-year-old spouses has almost a 50% chance of living to at least age 90, and a 20% chance of living to at least age 95.\n\u201cThat\u2019s 25-30 years, or more, in retirement! And, over that time, inflation is likely to have a significant impact on living expenses, not to mention healthcare costs.\u201d\nLate-Life Healthcare Costs\nA study by Fidelity found that the average 65-year-old married couple can expect to spend $315,000 on medical expenses over the course of their retirement.\n\u201cUnexpected healthcare and long-term care costs can and often do crop up,\u201d add Kullberg. \u201cAnd when they do, they have a significant impact on retirement savings.\u201d\nUnderperforming Investments\nYou\u2019ve read it a hundred times: past performance does not guarantee future results.\nThe 4% Rule for safe withdrawal rates is based on past stock and bond markets\u2019 performance. But who\u2019s to say that the stock market will keep generating similar returns in future decades?\nLow birth rates and slowing population growth may rob financial markets of momentum. \u201cFinancial planners put a lot of work into projecting the success of investments for retirement, but those forecasts are fallible,\u201d explains Kullberg.\n\u201cIf your investments underperform, especially with a budget that\u2019s already tight, you may have the savings you need to sustain your lifestyle in retirement.\u201d\nSequence of Returns Risk\nFrighteningly, your long-term average returns could match projections and you could still run out of money.\nKnown as a sequence of returns risk, Buckingham explains that a stock market crash early in your retirement wreaks far more havoc on your portfolio than the same crash later on. \u201cIf a retiree\u2019s assets decline early in their retirement years, it forces them to withdraw a higher percentage of their assets than planned.\u201d\nWithdraw too much early on, and your portfolio shrinks too small to recover \u2014 even when the market bounces back.\nSave more than you think you\u2019ll need for retirement. You can always pass assets on to your children or charities, but it\u2019s a lot harder to add income and replenish a failing nest egg in retirement.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\n70% of Gen Xers Say They Can't Afford To Retire -- They're Right If They Don't Do These 8 Things\nAugust 21, 2025\n5 min Read\nNearly 42% of Boomers Are Living Paycheck to Paycheck: Here's How It's Delaying Retirement\nAugust 21, 2025\n5 min Read\nHere's How Long $1 Million in Retirement Savings Will Last You After Age 65\nAugust 19, 2025\n5 min Read\nFor Boomers Closing in on Retirement: 5 Ways To Make Sure You're on Track\nAugust 19, 2025\n5 min Read\nI'm a Financial Expert: This Is the No. 1 Thing Every American Should Do With Their 401(k)\nAugust 19, 2025\n5 min Read\n- How Long Will My Money Last?\n- How Much Do You Need To Retire?\n- How To Prepare For Retirement\n- How To Save For Retirement Without A 401K\nLearn More About Early Retirement Planning\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

This number is way out of reach for many Americans, though, considering 28% of people recently told GOBankingRates that they had nothing saved and most of the rest don\u2019t have close to seven figures.\nAs big a chunk of change a $1 million sounds like, surprisingly it doesn\u2019t last quite as long as you might think it would \u2014 but that all depends on the state you live in when you retire.\nIf you live in one of the more expensive states, like Hawaii or New York, you\u2019ll want to work as long as possible and save as much money as possible because $1 million won\u2019t even cover your living expenses for 15 years. There is a bit more cushion in many Midwestern and Southern states, though, if you live there or planning a move.\nHawaii\n- Annual groceries cost: $6,463\n- Annual housing cost: $37,135\n- Annual

sourced from the U.S. Census American Community Survey \u2014 and used the Missouri Economic Research Information Center for grocery, healthcare, housing, utilities, transportation and miscellaneous cost-of-living indexes. Using the cost of living indexes and the national average expenditure costs for retired households, as sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey, the average expenditure cost for each location was calculated. The average single-family home value was sourced from Zillow Home Value Index for Feb. 27, 2025. Using the home value, assuming a 10% down payment, and using the most recent national average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, as sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, the average mortgage was calculated. Using the average mortgage and average expenditure costs, the average cost of living was calculated. Assuming $1 million in retirement savings, the number of years to draw down was calculated. The states were sorted to show the shortest to longest years until your savings is depleted. All data was collected on and is up to date as of Feb. 27, 2025.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\n70% of Gen Xers Say They Can't Afford To Retire -- They're Right If They Don't Do These 8 Things\nAugust 21, 2025\n10 min Read\nNearly 42% of Boomers Are Living Paycheck to Paycheck: Here's How It's Delaying Retirement\nAugust 21, 2025\n10 min Read\nHere's How Long $1 Million in Retirement Savings Will Last You After Age 65\nAugust 19, 2025\n10 min Read\nFor Boomers Closing in on Retirement: 5 Ways To Make Sure You're on Track\nAugust 19, 2025\n10 min Read\nI'm a Financial Expert: This Is the No. 1 Thing Every American Should Do With Their 401(k)\nAugust 19, 2025\n10 min Read\n- How Long Will My Money Last?\n- How Much Do You Need To Retire?\n- How To Prepare For Retirement\n- How To Save For Retirement Without A 401K\nLearn More About Early Retirement Planning\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIt\u2019s possible for retirees to live on Social Security alone, but according to ChatGPT, it\u2019s challenging, and rarely enough for a comfortable and secure retirement.\nSocial Security was never intended to cover the entire cost of living in retirement, but in some situations, there are those who can make it work. Here\u2019s what ChatGPT had to say about what Social Security covers, if it\u2019s enough, and who is living on this income alone.\nWhat Social Security Typically Covers\nAccording to the Social Security Administration (SSA), Social Security will replace about 40% of annual pre-retirement earnings on average. So, someone earning $60,000 per year on average throughout their working years can expect roughly $2,000 per month in Social Security income at full retirement age.\n\u201cThat may cover essentials in low-cost areas, but it often falls short of a full budget,\u201d ChatGPT said.\nIs That Enough?\nFor most retirees, Social Security income is not enough to live on.\nAs of June 2025, the SSA\u2019s latest data showed the average monthly benefit for retired workers was $2,005.05 per month, or about $24,060 annually. But according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, individuals aged 65 and older spent an average of $60,087 in 2023.\nAnd these figures are often higher in high-cost areas. \u201cEven retirees who own their homes often face rising expenses like utilities, food and medical bills,\u201d ChatGPT added.\nRetirement experts typically recommend replacing about 70% to 80% of pre-retirement income through a combination of Social Security benefits, investments and personal savings, SSA reportrd.\nWho Is Living on Social Security Alone\nWhile it\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s not impossible.\nA survey conducted by The Senior Citizens League found that 27% of older Americans rely solely on Social Security for their income.\nIn one example shared by Business Insider, Taffi Ozenne, a 68-year-old retiree living in northern California, has no retirement savings and lives on her $1,739 monthly Social Security check plus what she earns from part-time work.\nAnother retiree, Susan Harper, lives on less than $1,000 in Social Security benefits plus SNAP with no investment income. However, she is able to save on some costs by living with her sister in Washington, D.C., until she\u2019s approved for low-income housing.\nLiving on Social Security can be done, but it usually comes with trade-offs, including reliance on public assistance or help from family."

      "text": "Social Security\u2019s Future: 5 Backup Income Sources Every Retiree Should Consider\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nPotential cuts to Social Security benefits understandably concerns many retirees. Social Security often comprises a significant portion of income for its near 58 million recipients, according to the Social Security Administration (SSA). A reported insolvency in seven years may create growing unease for those depending on monthly benefits.\nDual-earning couples may see an $18,100 annual reduction in benefits, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). Amounts can vary depending on specific circumstances. Taking prudent action now can help provide income to offset any loss in benefits.\nBefore considering any backup income source, retirees should consult with a trusted financial advisor to create a plan.\nRetirement Accounts\nIRAs and 401(k) accounts are popular retirement planning tools for many Americans. Roughly 54% of Americans had such accounts in 2022, according to Congress.gov. Wisely tapping these accounts can be a good way to complement a reduction in benefits.\n\u201cIf you have 401(k)s, IRAs or other retirement accounts, it is time to make a plan to access them if your Social Security benefits get squeezed. The challenge is to set up a withdrawal and tax plan that maximizes the income you can get from your retirement accounts across the rest of your life,\u201d said Jay Zigmont, PhD, certified financial planner (CFP) and founder at Childfree Trust.\nSpeaking with an advisor can help seniors create a withdrawal plan.\nAn Annuity\nAnnuities often get a bad rap, thanks to fees and other potential charges. While not for everyone, an annuity can be a good fit for some retirees. Fixed annuities commonly have reduced points of entry, making them easier for seniors to purchase.\n\u201cOne of the most reliable ways to create backup income in retirement is through fixed indexed annuities with guaranteed income riders,\u201d noted Matt Eilers, CEO and Founder of Medalist Wealth Management. \u201cThese income sources grow based on the performance of a stock index, like the S&P 500, but the principal is protected against market volatility, and the income riders guarantee a predictable income payment through retirement.\u201d\nA Part-Time Job\nHaving a part-time job in retirement may not be desirable, but it can be a good way to supplement Social Security payments. Retirees can earn up to $62,160, as of 2025, before benefits are reduced, according to the SSA.\nWorking a side gig may be attractive, but Zigmont advises seniors to look elsewhere for work.\n\u201cWhile gig work, like driving for Uber, may be popular, it is unpredictable and comes with other costs. Part-time jobs are probably the best bet, as you don\u2019t need the benefits,\u201d said Zigmont.\nDividend-Paying Stocks\nInvesting in dividend-paying stocks has long been a way for retirees to earn income. Americans can house such investments in both retirement and non-retirement accounts. Holding them in the latter can provide cash flow, and lower-income retirees may face 0% federal tax on them, if they\u2019re classified as qualified dividends, according to Fidelity.\nThis strategy poses some risk of placing you in a higher tax bracket and potentially losing the tax deferral benefits found in retirement accounts. Speak with an advisor to identify if this is an option for you.\nUse Your Home\nFor many Americans, their home is their most valuable asset. If you can downsize, it can free up cash. For example, if your current home is paid off and worth $350,000, and you move to a $200,000 home, that\u2019s $150,000 in cash you can claim, before fees tied to selling the house. Such an amount could offset a reduction in benefits.\nA reverse mortgage is another possibility, but it may not be worth the risks and fees associated with such an action.\nA reduction in Social Security benefits can cause grave concern for many seniors. Pairing the right backup income source with reduced spending can help mitigate the financial impact."

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 YearsHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed by Experts\nTrusted by Millions of Readers\nReliable and dependable transportation these days is not cheap. The average monthly car payment is $737 for new vehicles and $525 for pre-owned options. With numbers like that staring them down, buyers might assume that the lowest price tag in their category is always the best option.\nHowever, when inexpensive means cheap, drivers spend more for the endless repairs and maintenance issues that plague poorly built vehicles. Instead, they should consider the following cars, trucks and SUVs, which cost more than some comparable models but save their owners money over time by staying out of the shop.\nSubaru Outback\nSubaru\u2019s flagship model starts at $29,010 \u2014 and you can certainly find cheaper midsize SUVs.\n\u201cThe Outback is one of the more expensive crossover vehicles,\u201d said Melanie Musson, an industry expert with AutoInsurance.org. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s worth spending more because they\u2019re reliable. Their engines are excellent and known for durability. Their all-wheel drive and ground clearance make them ideal in winter weather and back roads, and they retain their value, so you\u2019ll get back a lot of what you bought one for.\u201d\nAnd the Outback isn\u2019t alone \u2014 Subaru is known for dependability, durability-based long-term value, and, of course, its famous standard AWD.\n\u201cSubarus have a strong reputation for versatility and reliability,\u201d said Mark Beneke, co-owner of Westland Auto Sales in Fresno, California. \u201cWhile they may not be the cheapest to work on, their engines and all-wheel-drive systems are extremely durable, so it limits the number of repairs needed. Plus, the all-wheel-drive system makes these vehicles jacks of all trades.\u201d\nGMC Sierra 1500\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a pickup, you might scratch the GMC Sierra 1500 off the list because its $40,295 is higher than the Ford Ranger, Ford F-150, Chevy Colorado, Chevy Silverado and Ram 1500.\nBut before you rule it out, consider that GMC asks a little more up front in exchange for long-term dependability.\n\u201cGMC costs more than its Ford and Ram competition, but it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Musson said. \u201cWhen some trucks get a couple of years old, you\u2019ll start dealing with annoying things like power going out to door locks, rattling parts and other small problems. GMC manufactures a step above the competition and puts as much effort into the details as it does into the engine.\u201d\nLexus ES\nLexus is synonymous with luxury, and the ES starts at $43,215. It\u2019s a bargain, though, when considering how expensive luxury cars are to repair \u2014 and how infrequently the ES is in the shop.\n\u201cThe Lexus ES is a smart buy in the luxury segment,\u201d said Patryk Doornebos, owner and lead author at the automotive blog Car Triple. \u201cIt\u2019s pricey up front but saves you money with its Toyota-derived reliability and low repair costs, not to mention its strong resale value. It\u2019s a luxury car that\u2019s cost-effective in the long run.\u201d\nGenesis G80 and G90\nJust as Lexus inherits the famous reliability of the Toyota brand that owns it, the Genesis luxury nameplate is owned by Hyundai, another automaker known for infrequent trips to the mechanic.\nThe G80 starts around $57,100 and the G90 starts at a hair under $90,000, outclassing even the Lexus ES \u2014 but higher MSRPs sometimes translate into better long-term value.\n\u201cThe perception of luxury cars as expensive upfront investments is often balanced out by their reliability and lesser frequency of required repairs,\u201d said 30-year auto industry veteran Frank De Mulder, owner of Classic Car Maintenance. \u201cSome notable models in this category for 2023 include the Genesis G80 and Genesis G90, which have been recognized for their dependability and luxury at a relatively affordable price compared to their counterparts.\u201d\nHonda Accord\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book, at least seven midsize sedans have lower starting MSRPs than the Honda Accord, including the Subaru Legacy, Chevy Malibu, Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5, Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry and Volkswagen Passat.\n\u201cEven so, KBB still named the Accord its \u201cMidsize Car Best Buy of 2023,\u201d Beneke said. \u201cAccords are known for their longevity and minimal repair needs, which can make them a good value proposition despite a higher upfront cost.\u201d\nPretty Much Any Electric Vehicle\nThe EV market has welcomed several relatively affordable models in recent years, but they still cost more, on average, than comparable ICE models. But when you go electric, you leave behind the headaches and expenses that are inherent to even the best engines.\n\u201cPretty much any model of electric vehicle is a prime example of a car that may seem expensive up front but which can actually be economical in the long run due to their minimal repair needs,\u201d said Aidan Rushby, CEO and co-founder of vehicle-financing platform Carmoola. \u201cEVs have fewer moving parts, which means there\u2019s usually less that can go wrong, leading to lower repair costs. The cost of consumables like tires, brake discs and pads will still need to be factored in, and as EVs are typically heavier than their combustion engine counterparts \u2014 you may need to replace these a little more frequently. But, on balance, and with the savings on fuel factored in, an EV can be a better option long term.\u201d\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\nI'm a Car Expert: 6 Affordable and Reliable SUVs for Families of 4 or More\nAugust 21, 2025\n5 min Read\n6 Popular SUVs That Aren't Worth the Cost -- and 6 Affordable Alternatives\nAugust 20, 2025\n5 min Read\nWhat Does It Cost To Charge a Tesla Monthly Compared to Gas for a Honda CR-V?\nAugust 21, 2025\n5 min Read\n6 Best Items To Buy at Dollar Tree Now for the Second Half of 2025 To Save Big Money\nAugust 22, 2025\n5 min Read\nHere's What It Costs To Charge a Tesla Monthly vs. Using Gas for a Toyota Tacoma\nAugust 21, 2025\n5 min Read\nI Asked ChatGPT How To Create a Budget for the Average Middle-Class Family: Here's What It Said\nAugust 20, 2025\n5 min Read\nI'm a Dollar Tree Superfan: 2 Ways To Save Money Using Its Rewards Program\nAugust 20, 2025\n5 min Read\nBest Ways To Save Your Money\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

GOBankingRates identified cities with a population of at least 150,000 and a population percentage of residents aged 65 and over of at least 10%. For each location, GOBankingRates found total population, population ages 65 and over, total households and household median income, all sourced from the U.S. Census American Community Survey. Using this data, the percentage of the population ages 65 and over was calculated. The cost-of-living indexes were sourced from Sperling\u2019s BestPlaces and include the grocery, healthcare, housing, utilities, transportation and miscellaneous cost-of-living indexes. Using the indexes and the national average expenditure costs for retired households, as sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey for retired households, the average expenditure cost for each location was calculated. The livability index was sourced from AreaVibes for each location and included as supplemental information to help determine the quality of life. The average single-family home value was sourced from Zillow Home Value Index for December 2024. Using the average home value, assuming a 10% down payment, and using the most recent national average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, as sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, the average mortgage was calculated. Using the average mortgage and average expenditure costs, the average cost of living was calculated. The cities were sorted to show the cheapest total cost of living as well as the cheapest total expenditure costs. All data was collected on and is up to date as of Feb. 18, 2025.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\n70% of Gen Xers Say They Can't Afford To Retire -- They're Right If They Don't Do These 8 Things\nAugust 21, 2025\n7 min Read\nNearly 42% of Boomers Are Living Paycheck to Paycheck: Here's How It's Delaying Retirement\nAugust 21, 2025\n7 min Read\nHere's How Long $1 Million in Retirement Savings Will Last You After Age 65\nAugust 19, 2025\n7 min Read\nFor Boomers Closing in on Retirement: 5 Ways To Make Sure You're on Track\nAugust 19, 2025\n7 min Read\nI'm a Financial Expert: This Is the No. 1 Thing Every American Should Do With Their 401(k)\nAugust 19, 2025\n7 min Read\nHere's How You May Lose $18,100 in Social Security in 2033 and What To Do About It\nAugust 20, 2025\n7 min Read\n- How Long Will My Money Last?\n- How Much Do You Need To Retire?\n- How To Prepare For Retirement\n- How To Save For Retirement Without A 401K\nLearn More About Early Retirement Planning\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

      "text": "A significant retirement crisis looms for many Americans, with seniors in 41 states and Washington, D.C., projected to outlive their savings and face an average shortfall of $115,000.\nOlder Americans in nearly every state are on track to outlive their retirement income and savings, a new analysis from Seniorly has found.\nAcross the U.S., older adults face an average gap of about $115,000 between what they\u2019re projected to spend during retirement and what they\u2019re likely to bring in from Social Security, savings, and investments. In 41 states and Washington, D.C., retirees are expected to fall short. Only nine states do seniors have enough of a financial cushion to fully cover their costs.\nThat\u2019s the alarming takeaway from a new Seniorly report on where seniors are most and least likely to outlive their savings. The findings come as the surging cost of living puts even more pressure on older adults living on fixed incomes and retirement plans.\nOlder adults are already bracing for the challenge. Today, more than half of Gen Xers and 40% of Baby Boomers expect to outlive their savings, according to a survey from Northwestern Mutual.\nModern retirement can easily last 20 or 30 years, yet the cost of housing, health care, food, and other essentials has climbed sharply \u2013 eroding the value of even well-planned nest eggs. A dollar doesn\u2019t stretch as far as it once did, and a single unexpected expense, like a medical emergency or major home repair, can throw off an otherwise solid financial plan.\nThe \u201cmagic number\u201d that Americans now think they need to retire is $1.26 million, Northwestern Mutual found. But in many places, even that may not be enough to guarantee peace of mind.\nIn some states, affordable living costs and modest expenses make it easier to stretch savings and maintain a decent quality of life. In others, high prices can drain those savings long before a person\u2019s needs begin to decline.\nTo understand how retirement readiness varies by location, Seniorly analyzed where older adults are most and least likely to outlive their savings. Using the latest available data on life expectancy at age 65, Social Security income, household net worth, and cost-of-living metrics, we estimated how far seniors\u2019 financial resources are likely to stretch over a typical retirement in each state. More details are included in the methodology below.\nThe results reveal sharp geographic divides, and highlight where older Americans are best positioned to age with financial security.\nIn this report, a positive cushion means retirees in that state, on average, have enough income and assets to cover their expected expenses. A negative number signals a likely shortfall, with seniors at greater risk of outliving their financial resources.\nSome states pose big challenges for retirees. New York, ranked 51st overall, tops the list for the toughest financial outlook, with seniors facing a huge gap of $448,000 between what they\u2019ll need and what they\u2019re expected to have. That\u2019s because while New York is one of the most expensive states for seniors (they\u2019ll need $1.12 million to cover living expenses over 19.4 years of expected retirement) they can expect to collect just $670,000 between retirement benefits, savings, and other investments.\nNo. 50 Hawaii and No. 49 Washington, D.C., also rank among the worst, with seniors also facing major shortfalls ($417,000 and and $407,000, respectively) due to sky-high living costs. Rounding out the bottom five are No. 48 Alaska and No. 47 California, where expenses like housing and healthcare put a heavy strain on retirement savings.\nIn some states, retirees have a strong financial edge. No. 1 Washington tops the list, with seniors enjoying a healthy cushion of about $146,000 between what they\u2019re projected to earn and what they\u2019ll need to spend. That\u2019s thanks to a combination of a high retirement income ($1.13 million) and expenses that, while not the lowest, are still manageable compared to many other high-earning states.\nNo. 2 Utah follows closely, with seniors expected to have a surplus of about $121,000 \u2013 another example of strong incomes (about $994,000) paired with moderate living costs ($873,000). No. 3 Montana, No. 4 Colorado, and No. 5 Iowa also land in the top five. Montana retirees have a projected financial cushion of about $43,000, while those in Colorado and Iowa enjoy smaller but still meaningful surpluses of around $38,000 and $32,000, respectively.\nThese top-ranked states show how retirees can fare best when decent nest eggs are matched with a cost of living that doesn't eat away at every dollar. In these places, seniors are less likely to face the stress of running out of money later in life.\nRetirement income isn't just about Social Security \u2013 it also reflects how much seniors have managed to save. Despite its poor overall ranking, seniors in No. 50 Hawaii actually have the biggest financial cushion in the country, with a projected income of $1.32 million over their retirement years.\nSeniors in No. 1 Washington, No. 46 Massachusetts and No. 7 Maryland can also expect to bring in at least $1 million in their golden years, underscoring that wealth does not guarantee financial security once expenses are factored in.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, seniors in No. 43 Louisiana and No. 40 Mississippi have the smallest nest eggs, with projected retirement incomes of just $479,000 and $488,000, respectively. No. 35 West Virginia, No. 41 Arkansas and No. 36 Alabama are also near the bottom, with projected incomes of $526,000 or below.\nRetirement costs can make a big difference in how far savings stretch, and some states are far more affordable than others.\nNo. 50 Hawaii is the most expensive place to retire, with seniors facing projected lifetime expenses of $1.74 million. Meanwhile No. 46 Massachusetts and No. 47 California aren\u2019t far behind, with estimated expenses of $1.31 million and $1.26 million, respectively. These high costs reflect the steep price tags on housing, healthcare, and everyday essentials.\nOn the opposite end, No. 25 Oklahoma and No. 40 Mississippi offer the most affordable retirements, both with projected expenses below $650,000. No. 8 Kansas hit the sweet spot, with total retirement costs coming in around $746,000 \u2013 but expected income even higher.\nThese states help show how location alone can influence whether seniors are likely to outlive their savings, even without major differences in income.\nNo matter where you live, preparing for retirement requires more than just saving. It means thinking ahead to anticipate your needs, costs, and lifestyle. Here are a few ways to stay ahead of the curve:\nWhether you're planning for your own future or helping a loved one make smart choices, understanding trends in cost of living and finances can make a real difference in the ability to age with peace of mind, independence, and dignity. For those weighing options for retirement or long-term care, location matters more than ever.\nTo determine where seniors are most and least likely to outlive their savings, we analyzed the latest available data across a range of economic and demographic indicators.\nFirst, we used state-level life expectancy at age 65 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to estimate how many years seniors are likely to spend in retirement. We then calculated expected retirement income over those years, combining average annual retirement benefits (Social Security Administration) with median net worth, including financial assets and retirement account savings (Census Bureau).\nFor a few states where median net worth data wasn\u2019t available, we used the national average net worth of $176,500. We also adjusted median household net worth for seniors to reflect that typical senior households hold about 80% more net worth than the national average household, based on Census data. We included home equity in net worth calculations to account for assets that seniors may opt to sell to help cover their retirements.\nTo estimate expected retirement expenses, we started with seniors\u2019 average spending on essentials like housing, groceries, transportation, and healthcare across the U.S. (Bureau of Labor Statistics), then adjusted these figures for each state\u2019s cost of living (Missouri Economic Research and Information Center). This gave us a realistic picture of how much seniors are likely to spend annually in each state.\nBy comparing projected income with projected spending over their expected remaining years, we identified which states give seniors the best chance of covering their retirement \u2013 and where they are most at risk of outliving their savings under current economic conditions.\nChristine Healy is the Chief Growth Officer at Seniorly, a senior living technology company.

These expenses are now coming back to bite them.\nWhat are they, and how can succeeding generations avoid these often innocent mistakes?\nLong-Term Care Planning\nPatrice Williams-Lindo, CEO of Career Nomad, saw just how painfully pricey long-term care for seniors can be while helping both her parents and in-laws navigate aging, illness and end-of-life care.\n\u201cI can tell you firsthand: the costs boomers didn\u2019t plan for aren\u2019t just financial \u2014 they\u2019re emotional, generational and systemic,\u201d Williams-Lindo said. \u201cMy family was quoted over $6,000/month for quality assisted living in Georgia. Multiply that over a few years and you\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 money most didn\u2019t save because they assumed retirement meant rest; not round-the-clock care.\u201d\nMany financial experts, including Jay Zigmont, PhD, MBA, CFP, founder and CEO of Childfree Wealth, agreed with Williams-Lindo that lack of long-term care planning among boomers \u2014 and younger generations \u2014 is among the worst and costliest mistakes.\n\u201cA year in a skilled nursing facility runs $115k, on average. Men will spend 2.2 years in care, and women 3.7,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cWithout a plan to pay for long-term care, the first person that needs care may cause their spouse to go broke.\u201d\nLong-term care, whether you pay out of pocket or with a long-term care insurance policy, is incredibly expensive, so it makes sense that so many boomers didn\u2019t bother.\n\u201cFor a couple that wants to pay out of pocket, I recommend setting aside $500k now,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cIf you are single, you also need to set aside $500k. That may not make sense on the surface, but with a couple, your spouse often provides care for some time, making the total cost lower.\u201d\nInflation\nA common unplanned for expense that Frederick Saide, managing partner at MoneyMattersUSA, Advisory LLC often sees coming back to haunt boomers is inflation.\n\u201cI often get the response, \u2018That\u2019s not my problem,'\u201d Saide told GOBankingRates. \u201cThe assumption is retirement will not last all that long \u2014 certainly not 30 or more years \u2014 so \u2018I won\u2019t have to go through the inflation cycle three or four times\u2019 is the mindset.\u201d\nTo guide clients, Saide uses the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of Actuaries calculator on longevity to help establish both individual and joint life expectancies.\n\u201cWhat I want is an agreement on the time horizon to plan for; otherwise, we won\u2019t have a clear direction on how much money is needed to last, and what the client wants their money to achieve for them,\u201d Saide. \u201cThis process is the reality check moment when I show from 2002 to 2023 inflation averaged 5.5%, nearly double the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\u201d\nSocial Security and Pension Tax Burdens\nMany boomers made the mistake of not looking too deeply into the fine print of Social Security and required minimum distributions (RMDs). Specifically, they didn\u2019t study the tax aspect.\n\u201cUp to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxed, and RMDs can nudge retirees into higher tax brackets, triggering Medicare surcharges,\u201d said Andrew Latham, CFP, content director at Supermoney.com. \u201cRoth conversions in your 60s can help, but many wait too long.\u201d\nEstate Plan Updates\nDid you make a will in your 40s and not update it to reflect your needs and wants in your 60s? A lot of boomers make that mistake.\n\u201cMany times, people adopt a \u2018set it and forget it\u2019 mentality when it comes to estate planning,\u201d said Charles Nemes, co-founder and CEO at Nemes Rush Family Wealth Management. \u201cThis can lead to significant damage to the relationships beneficiaries enjoy today, and potentially put money into their hands when it could actually hurt them more than help them. Unfortunately, estate plans seldom reflect the current feelings of those who drafted them years ago because so many things could have changed. For example, a beneficiary may have issues with drugs/gambling/alcohol, or is getting divorced, has a child with special needs, is getting sued, or is in a high-risk profession.\u201d\nNemes recommended reviewing your estate plan at least every five years to be sure it clearly reflects your current knowledge and feelings about each beneficiary."

  "argos_summary": "Seniorly\u2019s latest analysis shows that 41 of 50 states and Washington, D.C. project seniors will outlive their savings, with an average shortfall of $115,000, and New\u202fYork tops the list with a $448,000 gap. Only nine states provide a financial cushion for retirees, while high\u2011cost states like Hawaii, California, and Washington, D.C. also face significant deficits. The article highlights the importance of early planning, using tools, optimizing Social Security, and preparing for unexpected expenses such as healthcare and long\u2011term care. It also notes that cost\u2011of\u2011living differences across states dramatically affect how far retirement savings will stretch, underscoring the need for tailored strategies to secure a comfortable retirement.",
