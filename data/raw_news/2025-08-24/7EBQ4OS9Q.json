  "description": "Scientists call for more research into potentially harmful levels of metals released into sea",
  "content": "Offshore wind farms could pose a health risk by poisoning shellfish eaten by humans, new research warns.\n\nPotentially harmful levels of metal from turbine protection systems are \u201con the horizon\u201d because toxicity risks are poorly assessed, say scientists.\n\nMaterials used to protect wind turbines from corrosion leach into the surrounding water, which could pose risks to ecosystems, seafood safety and human health, according to the University of Portsmouth study.\n\nOffshore wind farms release thousands of tonnes of metals \u2013 including aluminium, zinc and indium \u2013 each year.\n\nThe amount is expected to grow \u201cdramatically\u201d as wind farms play a major role in reducing the world\u2019s carbon emissions, according to the report published in the journal Nature\u2019s Ocean Sustainability.\n\nThe UK currently has 13 gigawatts of offshore wind power generating capacity and a government target of 100 gigawatts by 2050.\n\nProf Gordon Watson, of Portsmouth University\u2019s school of the environment and life sciences, said: \u201cOffshore wind farms are a vital part of our clean energy future.\n\n\u201cBut at the moment there is limited data on how these metals affect the environment near operational offshore wind farms, so it\u2019s hard to assess the full risks.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely not saying stop building offshore wind farms, we just need to monitor them appropriately \u2013 especially as they continue to expand.\n\n\u201cThe plans to scale up are ambitious and come with challenges that must be addressed.\u201d\n\nProf Watson explained that, to protect turbines from rusting, corrosion-protection systems are used, which can release metals into the ocean over time.\n\nThe study estimated annual inputs of metals from current European wind farms to be 3,219 tonnes of aluminium, 1,148 tonnes of zinc, and 1.9 tonnes of indium.\n\nThe figure for zinc already exceeds the sum of all known direct inputs and river discharges into the North Atlantic from key European countries.\n\nThe researchers say that locating seaweed and shellfish farms near to offshore wind farms \u2013 like the world\u2019s first co-located commercial-scale seaweed farm in the North Sea off the Dutch coast \u2013 could see metals from turbines build up in those species, leading to concentrations that could exceed safe limits for human consumption.",

  "summary": "A study by the University of Portsmouth has warned that offshore wind farms could pose a health risk by poisoning shellfish eaten by humans. The metals used to protect wind turbines from corrosion could leach into the surrounding water, posing risks to ecosystems, seafood safety, and human health. The study estimated that thousands of tonnes of metals, including aluminium, zinc and indium, released each year as wind farms contribute significantly to reducing global carbon emissions. The UK currently has 13 gigawatts of offshore wind power generating capacity and a government target of 100 gigawatts by 2050.",

The University of Portsmouth study estimates annual inputs of 3,219\u202ft of aluminium, 1,148\u202ft of zinc and 1.9\u202ft of indium, with zinc already exceeding known direct inputs to the North Atlantic. Metals could accumulate in nearby seaweed and shellfish farms, potentially exceeding safe consumption limits.
