  "description": "The AI-focused data center operator beat revenue forecasts but reported a $291 million quarterly loss, rattling investors.",
  "content": "The Livingston, New Jersey-based firm, which operates 33 data centers and is known for its impressive haul of NVIDIA GPUs, has secured blue chip names like Microsoft, OpenAI, and IBM as clients, becoming a darling of the A.I. space. With a three-year growth rate of 5,896 percent, it clocked in at number 45 on this year\u2019s Inc. 5000 list. CoreWeave posted $1.2 billion of revenue for the second quarter, exceeding analyst estimates of $1.1 billion. But its higher than expected losses overshadowed the earnings announcement. The firm reported a $291 million net loss for the second quarter\u2014$50 million above analyst predictions. CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator praised the company\u2019s \u201cstandout\u201d quarter, noting it was a testament to artificial intelligence proliferating through more areas of the economy. \u201cAdoption is expanding rapidly with enterprises increasingly viewing AI as a strategic imperative and CoreWeave as the force multiplier that enables adoption, innovation and growth,\u201d Intrator said Tuesday during the earnings call.\n\nCoreWeave highlighted its acquisition of AI developer platform Weights and Biases as a second quarter win. The company also increased its power capabilities from 600 megawatts to 2.2 gigawatts, allowing it to sustain the energy intensive demands that come with operating a data center . Intrator mentioned CoreWeave\u2019s proposed acquisition of Core Scientific, which provides digital infrastructure and bitcoin mining capabilities, will also expand the firm\u2019s computing power. (Core Scientific previously rejected CoreWeave\u2019s first attempt to buy it back in June 2024.) \u201c\u200b\u200bThe rationale behind the deal is quite simple and powerful,\u201d Intrator said. \u201cVerticalization creates tremendous operational and financial efficiencies that will strengthen our ability to serve our customers at scale.\u201d CoreWeave is forecasting revenue in the realm of $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion for the full year, higher than its original forecasts. But it holds significant debt worth $11.1 billion on its balance sheet, up from about $8 billion at the end of 2024.",
