      "feedback": "This draft anchors 0–3 weeks on tariff headlines and Labor Day promos, but it can be upgraded to world-class by tightening the causal chain and grounding every claim in verifiable specifics. Actionable edits: (1) recast the argument with a first-principles transmission framework: tariff policy changes (27.5% → 15%) create cost pressure for autos and goods; firms may pass through some of that to consumers, which shows up as near-term inflation/margin risk (Toyota NA loss cited) while others dispute the magnitude (Nikkei/NBER-like framing); quantify via explicit pass-through ranges where available and label uncertainty clearly (S15934PBQ). (2) anchor the near-term catalysts with precise, monitorable signals: Labor Day promotions are running through early September with concrete prices (Pottery Barn Indio Eucalyptus Outdoor Sectional at $2,235 from $2,794, i.e., ~20% off) and a batch of other deals (REI, HexClad, Saatva, etc.) (Q4G7EPJJ6); treat these as real consumption-capital inputs that could lift weekly retail momentum if inflation stays contained. (3) integrate a tight transmission path to the consumer: discretionary goods lift vs. autos-cost pressure, and how each feeds or tempers the Fed’s policy stance; add a simple, explicit conditional (if tariff pass-through remains muted, consumer-inflation risk stays contained; if pass-through re-accelerates, look for higher core CPI risks). (4) add explicit levels/thresholds to monitor: auto-price indices and CPI prints in the next 1–2 weeks, weekly retail-sales or unit-ship data around Labor Day, and consumer sentiment gauges; specify invalidation criteria (e.g., a sustained >% point beat in core CPI or a negative Labor Day week consumer-spending surprise) that would flip the posture. (5) quantify the consumer-hardware proxy: use BeeStation Plus at ~$400 with 8 TB to illustrate that durable consumer upgrades can occur at modest price points, reinforcing a shallow, price-sensitive lift in discretionary spend (8VMO3PFEO). (6) tighten citation discipline and scope: attribute near-term inflation/margin links to S15934PBQ, retail-labor promo specifics to Q4G7EPJJ6, and hardware-price signaling to 8VMO3PFEO; avoid nonessential, noise‑driven sources (e.g., Malik Beasley sports coverage) and ensure every assertion maps to one of these critical sources. (7) present a world-class, scenario-focused finish: produce a concise base/sideways/bullish scenario with explicit catalysts, a brief transmission story, and clearly defined next data points; end with a single, testable monitor list. Overall, the piece should read as a crisp 0–3 week thesis: “Immediate drivers are tariff pass-through risk and Labor Day promotion momentum; near-term catalysts are consumer-price data and promo-led retail strength; the reaction function is a cautious risk-on tilt if inflation remains contained, with key thresholds around core CPI momentum and weekly retail print.”",
