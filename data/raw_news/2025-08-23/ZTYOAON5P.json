  "description": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who in March was wrongfully deported to El Salvador's infamous CECOT prison, was released from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee on Friday.",
  "content": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia walks, as he has been released from the Putnam County Jail in Cookville, Tennessee, U.S., August 22, 2025.\n\nU.S. immigration officials have notified Kilmar Abrego Garcia of their intent to deport him to Uganda, his attorneys said in a Saturday filing that accuses the government of pressuring Abrego Garcia to accept a plea deal.\n\nThe move comes after Abrego Garcia, who in March was wrongfully deported to an infamous prison in El Salvador, was released from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee on Friday. He had been held there since he was returned to the United States in June to face federal human smuggling charges, which he denies.\n\nIn the new filing, Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that the Trump administration offered on Thursday to deport him to Costa Rica, after serving any sentence imposed by the court, if he agreed to remain in jail until Monday and plead guilty to both counts in the criminal indictment.\n\nAbrego Garcia declined to prolong his stay. His attorneys write that \"within minutes of his release\" on Friday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement representative informed them that \"the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda,\" ordering him to report to ICE's office in Baltimore on Monday morning.\n\nHis attorneys allege that the Trump administration is effectively forcing Abrego Garcia to choose between pleading guilty and being deported to Costa Rica, or being deported to Uganda.\n\n\"On Friday evening, the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning\u2014precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office\u2014to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,\" his attorneys say.\n\n\"There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers write.",

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from federal custody Friday, months after he was wrongfully deported to an El Salvador prison and accused of being a gang member.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in the Middle District of Tennessee ordered Abrego's release from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee, where he had been held since he was freed from El Salvador's CECOT prison in June.\nAbrego is en route to his family in Maryland, Sean Hecker, one of his attorneys, said.\nAbrego was \"unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the government's vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back against the Administration's continuing assault on the rule of law,\" Hecker said in a statement.\nHe now has 48 hours to reach his brother\u2019s house in suburban Maryland, where the judge said he\u2019s allowed to live under a series of conditions. He\u2019ll also have to check in with immigration officials at the ICE Baltimore field office.\nAbrego, a father of three, said in a statement Friday: \u201cToday has been a very special day because I have seen my family for the first time in more than 160 days.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank all the people who have supported me because after this long time I have witnessed that so many people have been by my side with such positivity,\u201d he said. \u201cToday I am grateful to God because He has heard me and today I am out. We are steps closer to justice, but justice has not been fully served.\u201d\nAbrego's attorneys had requested the 30-day pause that prevented their client from walking free last month out of fear that he might be detained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers upon his release.\nThat ruling followed two others that aimed to protect Abrego.\nIn July, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville sought to release Abrego. At the time, Crenshaw denied a government motion to block his release, writing that the Trump administration had failed to provide evidence that Abrego must remain detained or that he is a flight risk.\nAlso last month, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ruled that the U.S. government \"shall restore Abrego Garcia to his ICE Order of Supervision out of the Baltimore Field Office.\"\nXinis said her order to have Abrego placed under ICE supervision in Maryland, where he was living with his wife and children before he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, is necessary to \"provide the kind of effective relief to which a wrongfully removed alien is entitled upon return.\"\nThe July order, which also requires that the government provide 72 hours' notice if it intends to deport Abrego to a third country, is \"narrowly tailored\" to allow the Trump administration to initiate \"lawful immigration proceedings\" upon Abrego's return to Maryland.\n\"While his release brings some relief, we all know that he is far from safe. ICE detention or deportation to an unknown third country still threaten to tear his family apart,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"A measure of justice has been done, but the government must stop pursuing actions that would once again separate this family.\"\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen said that the fight is not over. \"While I have no doubt the Administration will continue its attempts to undermine Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s rights, we will continue fighting to see them maintained \u2014 because due process in this case does not end with his release,\" the Maryland Democrat said in a statement.\n\"This is a matter that\u2019s greater than just this one case or one man \u2014 if one person\u2019s rights are denied, then the rights of all of us are at risk.\"\nAbrego Garcia's case has become a central talking point in the Trump administration's deportation efforts after a monthslong back-and-forth legal saga.\nOn Friday, the White House doubled down in its attack against Abrego.\n\"Abrego Garcia is a criminal illegal alien, wife-beater, and an MS-13 gang member facing serious charges of human smuggling. He will face justice for his crimes,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. \"It\u2019s an insult to his victims that this left-wing magistrate intervened to put him back on the streets. Garcia will be subject to ankle monitoring to ensure the safety of the American public until further action can be taken.\"\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Abrego\u2019s release \u201ca new low.\u201d\n\u201cBy ordering this monster loose on America\u2019s streets, this judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people. We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country,\u201d she wrote on X.\nAbrego's lawyers have denied allegations that he is a gang member. They have said he was born in El Salvador and illegally immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland out of fear of gang violence in his home country.\nHe was first deported to CECOT \u2014 the notorious mega-prison in El Salvador \u2014 in March, in what the government called an \"administrative error.\"\nThe deportation directly conflicted with a judge's 2019 ruling that Abrego not be deported and came after he was detained by local police and accused of being a member of MS-13, an international crime gang. He was not turned over to ICE in that case, and his family and friends have repeatedly denied his involvement in the group.\nAbrego was returned to the U.S. in June and immediately federally charged with conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain in Nashville.\nHe has pleaded not guilty to both charges. A criminal jury trial in Tennessee over the human trafficking charges remains set for January."

      "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a lower court order that the Trump administration must facilitate the return to the United States of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was forcibly and wrongly deported to El Salvador, where he is being held in a notorious prison.\nBut the Supreme Court in its unsigned decision told Maryland Federal District Court Judge Paula Xinis to clarify the order she issued in the case, raising the question of whether the administration can and will be compelled by the courts to get Abrego Garcia back.\nXinis in her April 4th order directed the Trump administration \"to facilitate and effectuate the return\" of Abrego Garcia, who officials allege is a gang member, which he denies.\nIn its ruling Thursday, the Supreme Court said, \"The [district court] order properly requires the Government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"\n\"The intended scope of the term 'effectuate' in the District Court's order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court's authority,\" the Supreme Court said.\n\"The District Court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the ruling said.\nThe decision, which had no noted dissents, also directed the Trump administration to prepare \"to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps\" related to his possible return.\nXinis, within hours, modified her order to reflect the Supreme Court decision. Her new order omitted the word \"effectuate.\"\n\"To this end, the Court hereby amends this Order to Direct that Defendants take all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible,\" the judge wrote.\nXinis also ordered the government to file by 9:30 a.m. ET Friday a declaration addressing \"the current physical location and custodial status of Abrego Garcia, (2) what steps, if any, Defendants have taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's immediate return to the United States; and (3) what additional steps Defendants will take, and when, to facilitate his return.\"\nShe scheduled a status conference for the parties in the case at 1 p.m. in Greenbelt, Maryland, federal court.\nAbrego Garcia's lawyer, Andrew Rossman, in an email to NBC News, wrote, \"The rule of law won today.\"\n\"Time to bring him home,\" Rossman wrote of his client, a married El Salvador native who has three children with special needs.\nIn a letter Thursday night to U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who represented the Justice Department in the case before the Supreme Court, Rossman wrote that consistent with the high court's order \"we expect that the United States will facilitate Mr. Abrego-Garcia's immediate release from CECOT \u2014 tonight \u2014 and make all necessary arrangements for his return to this country, including by dispatching an aircraft to El Salvador to bring him home.\"\n\"As you know, given the conditions of Mr. Abrego-Garcia's confinement, and the grave risk to his safety in El Salvador, time is of the essence,\" the lawyer wrote.\nThe Justice Department, in a statement, said, \"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs.\"\n\"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy,\" the department said.\nBut the Supreme Court decision, by upholding Xinis' authority to direct the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, is a rebuke to the administration, which, since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, has made the forcible deportation of purported gang members a top priority.\nIn ruling in another case on Monday, the Supreme Court said the administration could resume using the Alien Enemies Act to seek the deportations of alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador.\nBut in a victory for civil liberty advocates, the court in the same ruling said the would-be deportees must be given time to challenge their detentions by U.S. authorities and to challenge the use of the act in their cases.\nAbrego Garcia was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maryland on March 12, and deported three days later.\nThe Trump administration opposed the order to return Abrego Garcia after acknowledging that he \"was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador was therefore illegal,\" the Supreme Court noted in its ruling.\nThe Justice Department said his removal was due to an \"administrative error.\"\nBut Justice Department lawyers also said Abrego Garcia was found to be a member of the notorious gang MS-13, which the United States has designated as a foreign terrorist organization.\nHis lawyers, however, deny that he is a member of that gang. They also said he has lived in the U.S. for a decade without ever being charged with a crime.\nIn a statement attached to the Supreme Court's order, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"To this day, the Government has cited no basis in law for Abrego Garcia's warrantless arrest, his removal to El Salvador, or his con- confinement in a Salvadoran prison. Nor could it.\"\n\"The Government remains bound by an Immigration Judge's 2019 order expressly prohibiting Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador because he faced a 'clear probability of future persecution' there,\" wrote Sotomayor, whose statement was joined by justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\"Instead of hastening to correct its egregious error, the Government dismissed it as an 'oversight.' \"\nSotomayor wrote that the government's only argument is that U.S. courts cannot grant relief to a deportee who crosses the border.\nThat \"is plainly wrong,\" she said.\n\"The Government's argument, moreover, implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene,\" Sotmayor wrote. \"That view refutes itself.\""

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States to face criminal charges involving an alleged undocumented immigrant smuggling ring Friday, months after the Maryland resident was wrongfully deported to a prison in his native El Salvador.\nAbrego Garcia has been indicted in federal court for the Middle District of Tennessee on charges related to transporting undocumented migrants within the United States.\nA lawyer for the married father of three called the charges \"an abuse of power\" and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games' with a federal judge who months ago ordered him returned to the U.S.\nThe indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia and others from 2016 through 2025 \"conspired to bring undocumented aliens to the United States from countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador, and elsewhere, ultimately passing through Mexico before crossing into Texas.\"\nThe grand jury that issued the indictment found that he made more than 100 trips smuggling thousands of immigrants.\nThe indictment was issued May 21 but remained sealed until Friday, shortly before Attorney General Pam Bondi announced at a press conference that Abrego Garcia had landed in the United States.\n\"The grand jury found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring,\" Bondi said.\n\"They found this was his full-time job, not a contractor. He was a smuggler of humans and children and women ... MS-13 members, violent gang, terrorist organization members throughout our country.\nBondi said that the ring Abrego Garcia was allegedly involved with is \"responsible for the death of more than 50 migrants in 2021 after the tractor-trailer overturned in Mexico.\"\nThe attorney general also detailed allegations in the indictment for which Abrego Garcia is not criminally charged.\nShe also said he \"abused undocumented alien females, according to co-conspirators, who were under his control while transporting them throughout our country,\" and \"trafficked firearms and narcotics throughout our country.\"\nThe attorney general also said, \"A co-conspirator alleged that the defendant solicited nude photographs and videos of a minor.\"\nAnd, \"A co-conspirator also alleges the defendant played a role in the murder of a rival gang member's mother,\" Bondi said. \"These facts demonstrate Abrego Garcia is a danger to our community.\"\nAbrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, in a statement to NBC 4 in Washington, D.C., said, \"The government disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order.\"\n\"Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\n\"This shows that they were playing games with the court all along. Due process means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after. This is an abuse of power, not justice,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\n\"The government should put him on trial, yes-but in front of the same immigration judge who heard his case in 2019, which is the ordinary manner of doing things, 'to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,' as the Supreme Court ordered.\"\nThe Trump administration says Abrego Garcia is a member of the notorious gang MS-13, which the U.S. considers a foreign terrorist organization. He denies belonging to the gang,\nAbrego Garcia was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maryland on March 12.\nHe was deported three days later in what the administration later conceded was a mistake.\nAbrego Garcia was subject to a 2019 withholding order by a judge forbidding his removal to El Salvador because of concerns he would be persecuted there.\nDespite its admission that he should not have been removed, the Trump administration has claimed it could not get Abrego Garcia back to the United States, even after a Maryland U.S. District Court judge ordered federal officials to facilitate his return.\nThe Supreme Court on in April upheld that order.\nIn a post on X on Friday, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele wrote, \"As I said in the Oval Office:1. I would never smuggle a terrorist into the United States. 2. I would never release a gang member onto the streets of El Salvador.\"\n\"That said, we work with the Trump administration, and if they request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course we wouldn't refuse,\" Bukele wrote.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to visit Abrego Garcia after his removal from the U.S., in a statement said, \"For months the Trump Administration flouted the Supreme Court and our Constitution.\"\n\"Today, they appear to have finally relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and with the due process rights afforded to everyone in the United States,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights \u2014 and the rights of all. The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.\""

  "argos_summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from a Tennessee jail after being wrongfully deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison, but U.S. immigration officials now threaten to deport him to Uganda unless he pleads guilty to human smuggling charges. His attorneys argue the Trump administration is coercing him into a plea deal to avoid a harsher rendition to Uganda, citing a prior offer to deport him to Costa Rica if he remains in jail. The case has drawn attention from the Supreme Court, which upheld a court order requiring the government to facilitate his return to the U.S., and has sparked criticism from lawmakers and civil\u2011rights advocates over due process and safety concerns. The situation highlights ongoing tensions over immigration enforcement, deportation practices, and the treatment of individuals accused of gang affiliation.",
