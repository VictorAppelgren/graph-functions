One is shown wearing a distinctive oversized black hoodie emblazoned with \u201cSAINT\u201d in all caps on it and another donning a gray skull cap with the words, \u201cPLEASURES SERVICE.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information on their whereabouts is asked to call the NYPD\u2019s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).\n\nThe public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website at https://crimestoppers.nypdonline.org/ on X @NYPDTips.",

Members reported hearing screams and called 911, before trying to resuscitate the young designer \u2013 who was later pronounced dead.\nThe good Samaritans told The Post they were woken by a naked man throwing sunscreen at their boat and saw him running down the dock screaming, \u201cDo something!\u201d\nDurnan, 60, a familiar figure at the club, owns the Durnan Group in Rockville Center, which manages the \u201clargest, most successful Workers Compensation Safety Group for Real Estate\u201d on the company\u2019s website.\nHe owns \u201cRipple\u201d and a second boat, \u201cHell in a Bucket,\u201d which was docked alongside and is also a shout-out to the Grateful Dead, several club members confirmed.\nDurnan did not return several requests for comment.\nSuffolk County cops have not filed charges or identified any suspects in the case. But authorities have also not publicly ruled out foul play, despite revealing that there was no evidence of violence to the body.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s death is also being investigated by Suffolk County\u2019s East End Drug Task Force, according to a Tuesday report by Newsday.\n\u201cUntil you start ruling stuff out, everything is in play,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation told the outlet.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra, a native of the tiny Irish town of Carlow, migrated to the US, where she started as a bottle service girl in SoHo before co-founding East x East, a swimwear label.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Irish Independent last year.\nHer partner in the East x East, Dylan Grace, posted a moving tribute on Instagram following her death.\n\u201cWe dreamed big together, laughed harder than anyone else could understand and built so much from nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed and grateful to have had you in my life.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra summered in the Hamptons, where she hosted successful pop-up shows and fashion exhibits for wealthy clientele in Montauk and the surrounding area.\nShe had finalized her divorce to ex-Sam Ryan just months before her death, according to court records reviewed by The Post.\n\u201cI represented Mr. Ryan in a matrimonial proceeding. The final papers had been submitted to the court, and before the Judgment of Divorce was issued, I became aware of Ms. Nolan-O\u2019slatarra\u2019s passing and promptly notified the court,\u201d his attorney, David Centeno, said in a statement. \u201cOut of respect for the privacy of those involved and my ethical restraints, I cannot discuss whether there was a prenuptial agreement, mediation, or other private arrangements.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s heartbroken mother, Elma Nolan, told the Irish Independent on Aug. 7 that her daughter was planning a trip home to Carlow before her death.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to my daughter,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI feel numb and in shock.\u201d\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Brandon Cruz, Joe Marino and Peter Senzamici"
