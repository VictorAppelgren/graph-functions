      "feedback": "Actionable edits to upgrade the analysis: Reframe as a tight, four-regime causal map (A–D) with one-sentence, testable chains from anchor fundamentals (ROIC>WACC, durable FCF/moats) to market pricing, anchoring each link with 1–2 hard data points from the sources (e.g., MSFT cloud growth ~39% and contracted base ≈ $368B; Shopify revenue +31% y/y and about $422M FCF; Ford Q2 adj margin ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.1%, EV loss ≈ $1.3B; UNH FCF yield >9% and ~3% dividend; LULU cash-rich and debt-light). Align horizons explicitly to the stated windows and calibrate probabilities only where supported (for 0–3 weeks use Base 55–70%, Upside 15–30%, Downside 15–25% with invalidations tied to port advisories, strike progress, and Brent/WTI moves as per I2SJU04DF and NBX9RA9WX), and ensure mid-term views are warranted by concrete triggers (GM capex cadence, Costa Coffee bid progress, Disney Lightning Lane uptake) with transparent rationale. Strengthen first-principles grounding by clearly mapping Regime D’s policy/tariff/AI-capex re-pricing to discount-rate shifts and showing how AI moat strength interacts with rate/tariff headwinds to drive re-rating (65UUBU0OR; 22PL3Q360); eliminate cross-regime internal contradictions by choosing a single coherent narrative for the near term while flagging sensitivities. Require precise quantification: replace adjectives with numbers and attach the exact source IDs after each claim (48JXC9VDP for MSFT/Shopify cloud/maturity, STBVARD8F for Nvidia/AI infra, 22PL3Q360 for Ford/AUTO, IGP1Q4ZEJ for UNH/LULU, U3ZK13ZQI for Disney, 65UUBU0OR for tariffs, I2SJU04DF/NBX9RA9WX for geo-risk and sentiment overlays), and tighten the watchlist to four explicit triggers (GM capex cadence; Costa Coffee sale progress; Disney Lightning Lane adoption; Israel–Houthi de-escalation/Red Sea port status) with clearly stated invalidations if those thresholds fail.",
