  "title": "Think you don\u2019t need a laptop cooling pad because you\u2019re not a gamer? Trust me: they\u2019ll help with these 3 tasks too",
  "description": "A recent heatwave made me realize: they\u2019re not only vital for gaming",
  "content": "You might not think you need a laptop cooling pad. Historically, I didn\u2019t either. Having spent a lot of the last year testing them for TechRadar, I mostly associate them with gaming. Not only does their conspicuous RGB styling make their raison d\u2019etre seem to be oriented entirely around making Cyberpunk 2077 run better, but most of the testing I run on them is built around gaming benchmarks.\n\nThat would be fine. After all, I am an unrepentant, lifelong gamer. But the one thing that\u2019s always stopped me from permanently installing a cooling pad on my desk is that I\u2019m not a laptop gamer. Not only do I already have a dedicated desktop rig and a Steam Deck, but the only laptop I own is a middle-aged MacBook Pro, which doesn\u2019t have the hardware guts to play serious AAA titles at a decent level. So what do I need with a gadget designed for those who do play that way?\n\nUnfortunately, my laptop\u2019s been experiencing some issues this summer. The main one is that it seems to be hitting temperatures almost high enough to sustain nuclear fusion. There\u2019s nothing quite like the concern that the block of aluminum on your lap is about to bond to your skin to start questioning whether your cooling setup is sufficient. Although this is helped along by the fact that it\u2019s hit 93\u00b0F (34\u00b0C) in the last few days, this has been an issue for a long time before the mercury was flash boiling.\n\nEven more troublesome has been my laptop\u2019s habit of exhibiting some serious crashes when under strain. I\u2019m not talking about polite little dings in a supermarket carpark \u2013 I\u2019m talking about spectacular fender-benders you don\u2019t seem to be able to free yourself from. In several instances, my CPU usage has redlined, and I\u2019ve been locked out of the software I\u2019m using, unable to force-quit anything or even coax a response out of the trackpad or function keys.\n\nClearly, my increasingly demanding requirements, gradually aging internal hardware, and blistering summer temperatures are all conspiring to the point that my laptop is sublimating into whole new states of matter. That\u2019s caused me to reassess my stance that cooling pads are largely just for esports players and preventing crypto mining setups from igniting.\n\nHere are just three that I\u2019ve personally experienced.\n\nAside from chain-watching episodes of Frasier and trying in vain to occasionally free up some disk space, producing music is the main thing I use my laptop for. I never really considered it to be that demanding a hobby in terms of CPU and RAM usage. Certainly, in the past, throwing down a few synthesizers and chopping up some loops hasn\u2019t proven that taxing for my system.\n\nHowever, now my setups regularly extend to up to 50 channels, laden with sophisticated samplers, high-end effects, and detailed automation, I find my CPU has to work overtime to handle everything I\u2019m throwing at it. That\u2019s fine most of the time. However, as the ambient temperature rises or my internal fan speed starts to drop as my battery runs low, this can cause either awful audio corruption or some of the aforementioned freezing.\n\nYes, there are workarounds for this. You can mix the most demanding channels down to flattened audio or even build newer groups of instruments over a backing track as a new save file. But this makes further editing a bit of a drag.\n\nInstead of buying a whole new computer \u2013 made marginally easier by the fact that the MacBook Air (M4) is currently reduced from $999 to $799 (\u00a3899 to \u00a3849) at Amazon \u2013 a cooling pad offers a way to protect your laptop from heat damage at these moments of peak CPU usage.\n\nA couple of layers of vectors is unlikely to put any real strain on your setup. But once you start dropping layer after layer of raster graphics, adding loads of FX, or creating myriad clipping masks, the demands it places on your system can quickly spiral.\n\nTake it from me: as Reviews Editor at TechRadar, I\u2019ve tested more than a few drawing tablets and, while my initial sketches don\u2019t necessarily cause my system to overheat, more complicated artworks tend to get its fan going like a jet engine.\n\nFortunately, I\u2019ve experienced fewer out-and-out disasters here during the heat than I have with music software. Entire system-locking tantrums have been less common than periodic \u2013 albeit still quite irritating \u2013 crashes to the desktop. Still, these are pretty clear symptoms that my processor isn\u2019t super-happy that I\u2019m playing Hokusai on one of the hottest days of the year.\n\nSo when working on art that involves heavy workflows, a laptop cooling pad is still a smart investment, particularly if the weather outside is getting sweltering. And given that many bulky drawing tablets don\u2019t lend themselves well to mobile setups, you\u2019ll likely be tethered to your desk anyway, meaning a cooling pad should slip comfortably into your current setup.\n\nIf you really want to put your laptop under heat stress, encoding 4K video or rendering 3D animation are probably the fastest ways to get there, short of using it to entrain your own LLM on the internet\u2019s entire oeuvre of Harry Potter fan fiction. Naturally, given the resolutions involved, these tasks are massively resource intensive \u2013 each second of your finished videos will contain at least 24 frames of 3840 x 2160 resolution and there\u2019s a huge amount of processing that goes on behind the scenes to achieve this.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t really tinker with 3D animation. I\u2019d like to claim that\u2019s because I\u2019ve never owned a computer with sufficient power to do it but, for the most part, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have that kind of patience or talent. But I\u2019ve tinkered with video editing now and then and it can come with some of the same issues as static art. Certain tools \u2013 *cough* Premier Pro *cough* \u2013 are pretty RAM hungry at the best of times and, when it comes encoding your video, your CPU is going to be doing a Herculean amount of work.\n\nGiven the age of my laptop, I\u2019m genuinely a bit worried this would make it go off like a firework of rare earth metals, which is why I wouldn\u2019t dream of subjecting it to this kind of workload without some extra cooling support. Again, laptop cooling pads can make a significant difference here \u2013 I\u2019ve personally seen them trim a good 35.8\u00b0F (19.9\u00b0C) off a laptop under stress, which could well spell the difference between tolerable warmth and serious damage.\n\nBy this point, I hope I\u2019ve convinced you that laptop cooling pads aren\u2019t just gear for gamers \u2013 they\u2019re handy tools for protecting your productivity powerhouse during a bunch of different workflows. But say you do want to pick one up, what\u2019s your best option?\n\nPersonally, if money\u2019s no object, I\u2019m always going to beat the drum for the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad. Not only does it look pretty classy for something partly aimed at gamers, with a single RGB running around its outside but it offers the best cooling I\u2019ve ever experienced. It slashed the baseline warming experienced by our testing laptop during stress testing from 57.4\u00b0F to 14.4\u00b0F (31.9\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C), which is a colossal degree of cooling. You\u2019ll pay a premium for it though, as its list price is $119.99 / \u00a3129.99.\n\nIf you\u2019re more worried about saving cash than shaving off as many degrees as possible, then this alternative pick should offer the perfect balance of affordable and frosty. As you can see from my Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad review, it stopped our testing laptop from warming more than 27.4\u00b0F (15.3\u00b0C), which is still pretty decent and should protect your machine from any lasting harm. Yet it does that while only costing $19.99 / \u00a320.99 \u2013 which is a massive $100 / \u00a3109 less than the Llano.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 I'm TechRadar\u2019s reviews editor \u2013 these are my top three laptop cooling pads for keeping your laptop chill during heatwaves\n\u2022 Want to check out all of our top recommendations for helping your laptop keep its cool this summer?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad offers a pretty compelling experience. Yes, it\u2019s pretty loud, but in return you get truly frosty cooling from its massive 4.72-inch 3,500rpm fan, comfortable ergonomics, and relatively subtle gaming flourishes and RGB lighting. Really the only issue I can spot is its cost \u2013 at this price, you can easily buy better cooling for not much more, or similar cooling for a whole lot less.\nPros\n- +\nExcellent cooling\n- +\nGreat ergonomics\n- +\nTasteful lighting and looks\nCons\n- -\nOutclassed by some rivals and outpriced by others\n- -\nRelatively loud\n- -\nSlightly cheap-feeling\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nLlano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad: review\nThe Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad is a relatively high-end option for keeping your gaming or productivity laptop cool. At $89.99 / \u00a3116.26 (around AU$140), it certainly costs a pretty penny; but in return you get a cooling pad with a giant 4.72-inch turbo fan capable of spinning at up to a ludicrous 3,500rpm.\nUnlike more shy and retiring options, the Llano V10 isn\u2019t scared to announce its presence \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s a little bit of a loudmouth. To benchmark this laptop cooling pad, I ran a 3DMark stress test on our Acer Predator Helios 300 testing laptop with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU testing laptop, while running the Llano V10 at max power for 15 minutes. Using a sound level meter, I measured the noise it was kicking out 10 minutes into the test; it registered 69dB from a few inches away, and 57.5dB at my head height. This makes the Llano the second-noisiest cooling pad I\u2019ve tested, right after the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad, which clocked 79dB and 64dB respectively.\nBut the one thing you can count on from this little blowhard is that it blows \u2013 hard. I measured our gaming laptop\u2019s peak temperature before benchmarking, and again at the conclusion of the 15-minute stress test. With the Llano running at max, its temperature rose from 81.5\u00baF (27.5\u00baC) to 103\u00baF (39.5\u00baC), a rise of just 21.5\u00baF (12\u00baC). This performance is right up there with the best cooling pads, with the only one I\u2019ve tested that could beat it being the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad. So, you\u2019re getting pretty icy cooling here.\nWhen it comes to design, the Llano V10 looks decent enough, treading just on the right side of cyberpunk styling without looking too conspicuously edgy or brutalist. The polygonal RGB lighting bars along the sides and back are tastefully done, allowing you to choose between a range of shifting hues. Unlike some laptop cooling pads, it isn't available in an array of colors; but the black offered looks just fine to my eyes.\nThe Llano also feels pretty ergonomic in use. It offers only a single height setting, which may not suit everyone, but I did find the 10-degree angle at which it held my laptop pretty comfortable for long-term use. However, its build does feel a little more insubstantial than products such as the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad \u2013 the V10's materials and buttons feel a little more plasticky and clicky than I\u2019d like.\nProbably the biggest question when it comes to the $89.99 / \u00a3116.26 (around AU$140) Llano V10 is down to value. On the one hand, you\u2019re absolutely getting the cooling you\u2019re paying for \u2013 the fact that it prevented our laptop from warming more than 21.5\u00baF (12\u00baC) is the second-best result from any laptop cooler I\u2019ve tested.\nThe only issue is the best result: the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad trimmed that warming back to 8\u00baC and yet costs only $119.99 / \u00a3129.99 (around AU$188.33), which isn't much more. Plus, it's often available for even less \u2013 for example, costing $95.99 at the time of writing in the US. That slightly weakens the Llano V10\u2019s value in comparison.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLlano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad review: price & availability\n- Launched on May 17, 2024\n- List price of $89.99 / \u00a3116.26 (around AU$140)\nHaving launched on May 17, 2024, the Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad is available now. It can be purchased from Amazon at a list price of $89.99 / \u00a3116.26 (around AU$140). While that\u2019s at the higher end of the market, it's still its lowest ever price in the UK, and only a few dollars off the $87.99 it briefly dropped down to in May 2025. As such, it represents a decent deal.\nUnfortunately, though, the fact that this is a premium product means it has quite a few rivals nipping at its heels. From one end of the market, the budget-priced $19.99 / \u00a320.99 / AU$66.91 Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad offered disproportionately frosty cooling for its mild price, seeing our test laptop rise by 27.5\u00baF (15.3\u00baC). Conversely, if you catch it on sale then you can pick up the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad from as little as $95.99 / \u00a3129.99 \u2013 it stopped our testing rig from warming any more than 14.5\u00baF (8\u00baC), which is a substantial performance boost for comparatively little extra spend.\nShould I buy the Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad?\nBuy it if\u2026\nYou want exceptional cooling\nThis is one of the most chill laptop cooling pads I\u2019ve ever had my hands on. It stopped our laptop from warming any more than 21.5\u00baF (12\u00baC) during our stress test, which is seriously impressive.\nYou want an attractive, comfortable cooling pad\nSitting at an ergonomic 10-degree angle, the Llano V10 is comfortable to use over long stretches of time. And its restrained use of RGB lighting means its looks aren\u2019t too in your face, either.\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026\nYou want the best cooling for your cash\nWith the Liangstar offering only marginally weaker cooling for much less money, and the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad offering superior cooling for not much more, the V10 probably isn\u2019t the best value option out there.\nYou hate noise\nThe Llano V10 isn\u2019t the loudest laptop cooling pad I\u2019ve ever tested, but it isn't far off. Both the pad and our testing laptop registered at a combined 69dB during tests, which is nearly as loud as highway traffic, according to the Center for Hearing and Communication.\nLlano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad review: also consider\nLlano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad\nThe higher-end stablemate of the V10, the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad offers the best cooling performance I\u2019ve encountered in tests so far. Even during our 3DMark stress test, this cooling pad kept our laptop's temperature from rising any more than 14.5\u00baF (8\u00baC), which is seriously arctic chilling. That\u2019s a pretty impressive step up from the V10, given its list price is just $30 / \u00a313.73 (around AU$48.33) higher. Read our full Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad review.\nLiangstar Laptop Cooling Pad\nIf you can\u2019t stretch to premium prices, the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad is your best shot for glacial cooling. During tests, it kept our laptop from rising by more than 27.5\u00baF (15.3\u00baC) \u2013 that\u2019s pretty decent cooling in its own right. But it\u2019s rendered far more impressive when you factor in its list price, which at just $18.99 / \u00a323.59 / AU$63.33, means it costs less than a quarter of the price of the V10. Read our full Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad review.\nHow I tested the Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad\n- Tested over the course of multiple days\n- Measured its cooling while running a stress test on our testing laptop\n- Recorded the combined volume of the cooling pad and laptop\u2019s fans\nI tested the Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad over the course of several days, using the standard TechRadar testing process I designed. First, I recorded the baseline temperature of our Acer Predator Helios 300 with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 testing laptop using a thermal camera. Then I ran a 3DMark stress test on the laptop for 15 minutes while setting the cooling pad to its highest setting, recording the laptop\u2019s temperature again at the end of the test to measure the impact the cooling pad had on the laptop's warming.\nIn addition, I measured the peak volume of the laptop and cooling pad to assess how much noise they kicked out. When the stress test had been in progress for 10 minutes, I checked the volume of the combined fan noise using a sound level meter, both from a few inches away and at my head height (21 inches from the surface of the laptop).\nI also tested how the Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad felt in use, while working and playing games, to assess its overall build quality and ergonomics. In terms of additional experience, I\u2019ve been using a gaming laptop and using creative workflows for decades, meaning I\u2019m very familiar with the struggle of keeping a laptop cool.\n- First reviewed: June 2025\n- Read more about how we test\nJosh is Reviews Editor at TechRadar.

Kootek Cooler Pad Chill Mat 5\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKootek makes a highly impressive laptop cooling pad, which uses five fans (the one in the middle is a bigger 120mm model, surrounded by 70mm fans) to deliver an impressive amount of cooling \u2013 while still remaining quiet to boot. The Chill Mat scores strongly in the versatility stakes as you can switch some of the fans off (it\u2019s possible to have one working, four, or all five), plus it can be raised (using a ratchet mechanism, like a deckchair) through six different height settings depending on your preference (you might want to crank it right up when watching a movie, for example).\nThis cooling pad can take 12-inch to 17-inch laptops, so all common sizes, with a pair of stoppers at the front to prevent the notebook from sliding off. It also boasts a USB hub with two USB 2.0 ports. In short, this is a high-quality cooling pad with flexibility in spades, and it benefits from a reasonable mid-range price tag, making it our top pick for an all-rounder that covers everything without doing too much damage to your wallet.\nThe best budget laptop cooling pad\n2. TeckNet N8 Laptop Cooling Pad\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want to spend as little as possible on a cooling pad, then TeckNet has a great solution which is priced as cheaply as you\u2019ll see anywhere. And, you\u2019re still getting a decent product.\nThe N8 comes with a trio of 118mm cooling fans which provide a decent level of cooling, plus the device benefits from a highly slim and portable design, too. It has a pair of feet that can be extended to raise it up, and a USB port to plug in an additional device (the N8 connects and is powered via USB, incidentally). The build quality perhaps isn\u2019t the best, but the N8 is impressively quiet, and quite simply it does the job \u2013 and does it very cheaply indeed.\nThe best premium laptop cooling pad\n3. Cooler Master NotePal U3 Plus\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCooler Master knows cool, you would hope, and the firm\u2019s Notepal is a winner in our books. Using a single large 230mm fan \u2013 which is impressively quiet, we might add \u2013 it has a fan speed controller, and is designed to pipe \u2018optimal airflow\u2019 through your laptop. Indeed, it shifts an impressive amount of air, being rated at 89.8 cubic feet per minute; a very effective level of cooling.\nThis device also benefits from a slightly tilted ergonomic design, aiming to give you the best angle to use your notebook\u2019s keyboard, along with nonslip feet for stability when placed on a surface. As an added bonus, there are three USB ports around the back.\nThe Notepal XL is capable of holding laptops up to 17-inches in size, and to cap things off, it\u2019s reasonably priced for the cooling performance you\u2019re getting here. This product is a very close second to the Kootek, but just loses out on the versatility front. If you can\u2019t find the Kootek outside of the US \u2013 in some regions stock seems very thin on the ground \u2013 then this is a great alternative for powerful cooling.\nThe best laptop cooling pad for large laptops\n4. Thermaltake Massive 20 RGB\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you need the best laptop cooling pad for a hefty notebook, then this Thermaltake product can cope with a massive laptop as the name suggests. It won\u2019t break a sweat with a 17-inch portable, and is even capable of playing host to larger 19-inch gaming laptops.\nIt has one 200mm fan for cooling (the fan speed is adjustable), and there are three different height settings (up to an angle of 13-degrees). The large fan provides efficient cooling for bigger laptops, plus you also get RGB lighting around the edges of the pad with various different modes (pulsing, blinking, or just static lighting of different colors).\nIt\u2019s fashioned from plastic and the build quality perhaps isn\u2019t the best you\u2019ll encounter in the cooling pad world, but it\u2019s plenty sturdy enough to do the job of supporting a hefty gaming laptop. Note that the price tag is reasonably hefty here, too.\nThe best laptop cooling pad with a USB hub\n5. Targus Chill Mat\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor those who want their cooling pad to also provide expansion capabilities to hook up a number of other peripherals, check out the Targus Chill Mat, which is a little bit like a laptop dock crossed with a cooling solution. The Chill Mat sports a 4-port USB hub (with USB 2.0 ports), and delivers cooling via a pair of fans (although Targus doesn\u2019t specify what size they are \u2013 although the maker does state that they can run at up to 2,500 rpm).\nThis is a well-constructed device which is impressively slim, and can be adjusted between four different height levels. For those with laptops that have few USB ports, this could be a useful solution on twin fronts.\nThe best slim laptop cooling pad\n6. Cooler Master Notepal X-Slim\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want a cooling pad which is nicely portable to carry around with you, then the X-Slim fits the bill. It measures only 27.5mm at its thinnest point, and it\u2019s very light with a weight of 700g.\nThere are other products that come close to this level of portability \u2013 Havit\u2019s 12-inch to 17-inch Laptop Cooler, for example \u2013 but Cooler Master\u2019s effort gets the nod due to its quality build. It\u2019s also capable of coping with laptops up to 17-inches in size, and the single 160mm fan offers excellent airflow while keeping things whisper-quiet. The X-Slim benefits from nifty cable management facilities, too, to keep things tidy as well as portable. While the Notepal X-Slim is tidily compact, if you want a truly portable accessory to cool your laptop, check out our final entry below.\nThe best portable laptop cooling solution\n7. Klim Cool\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOkay, so we thought we\u2019d throw this one in at the end as a bit of a wildcard, because while it isn\u2019t a laptop cooling pad as such, it\u2019s a fan-based accessory which does a similar thing (albeit via sucking rather than blowing air). And for those who want a really portable solution, this is a truly compact affair \u2013 whereas obviously any laptop cooling pad won\u2019t be all that small, given that they all (inevitably) have a notebook-sized footprint.\nNote that there is a sizeable caveat here: your laptop will need a vent at the side or rear for one of these devices to be attached. If you only have air vents on the base of your laptop, then we\u2019re afraid you\u2019re out of luck as far as these particular products go.\nAs mentioned, rather than blowing air into the laptop to cool it, the idea with a so-called \u2018vacuum cooler\u2019 is that they suck air out, but that has an equally cooling effect. Some even argue it\u2019s more effective than a traditional cooling pad, but either way, you\u2019re getting the job done as long as you pick a good product from the available solutions out there.\nAnd in this case, our recommendation is Klim Cool, a very effective cooler which comes with a number of different attachments so you\u2019re covered whatever the size of the air vent you\u2019re attaching the device to. It also measures the temperature inside your laptop and automatically adjusts the fan speed for the appropriate level of cooling \u2013 pretty nifty indeed.\nThe manufacturer backs the product with a five-year warranty and a 30-day free return policy, so you can give it a whirl to see how it works with your notebook. A further bonus is that this isn\u2019t an expensive accessory, either, falling in line with the pricing of the more affordable cooling pads.\nHow to shop for the best laptop cooling pad\nWhich laptop cooling pad is best?\nThere\u2019s no one best cooling pad out there, as each will provide its own level of cooling efficiency, adjustability, convenience, and pricing.\nHowever, we were impressed with the Kootek Cooler Pad Chill Mat 5, which topped our list above as the best overall choice. Each of its five fans can be individually controlled, and it offers six different height settings too - making it a very versatile choice for any size laptop.\nPlus, it has a reasonable price point, making it an affordable choice for most buyers.\nDo laptop cooling pads actually work?\nYes, they really do. Naturally, their results will vary according to make and model, but they all act to reduce the core temperature of your computer, helping it to maintain an optimum performance, and reducing damage to its key components.\nMost laptop cooling pads elevate your laptop from your desk or table, allowing for better airflow, while their cooling fans can get to work on the underside of your device. By providing your laptop with a constant supply of cold air, they can help to prolong its lifespan.\nToday's best laptop cooling pad deals\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nChristian is TechRadar\u2019s UK-based Computing Editor.

      "text": "I can\u2019t afford an air conditioner right now \u2013 but these 5 tech tips are making things more bearable during this heatwave\nFive simple tips to make the heatwave a little more bearable\nI have a love/hate relationship with summer. I love getting reacquainted with the sun and blue skies after seemingly endless months of British drizzle, but I loathe the lack of an air conditioner in my home, and I pretty much lose the ability to function if I\u2019m stuck inside as the temperature skyrockets.\nAnd while I felt totally validated in feeling like I was melting when the display on my beloved MeacoFan Sefte 8in air circulator was showing a temperature of 33 degrees Celsius in my living room (that\u2019s about 91 degrees fahrenheit for those in the US), watching that number only increase throughout the day made it abundantly clear that my current tactics weren\u2019t cutting it. This meant it was time to do some research and see what I could try in order to make things more bearable, without having to shell out on an air conditioning unit (and cringing as I watch my energy usage shoot up instead).\nTurns out I chose the right time to switch things up, as the Amazon Prime Day sale is in full swing, meaning that things like the best fans that are often full price in the summer are available at discounted prices.\n\u2022 See all of today's best deals at Amazon US\n\u2022 See all of today's best deals at Amazon UK\nI\u2019m going to share my top five tips for keeping cool below. So have a read, and let me know in the comments if they\u2019re helpful or if you have any other suggestions around beating the heat this summer.\nLights out\nIt feels like such a shame to block out the sun when the weather\u2019s so beautiful outside, but doing so is one of the top ways to stop the temperature rising super quickly, especially in south-facing rooms. So shut those windows, draw those drapes, and close those blinds first thing in the morning, as this\u2019ll help keep the heat at bay for a little longer.\nIf you\u2019re anything like me and you prefer to keep the windows open so you can enjoy the fresh air, I\u2019d recommend looking into buying an efficient air purifier. Having one of these running helps to circulate and freshen the air, and will help tackle extra pollen or pollution from having the windows open, too.\nBlueair makes some fantastic air purifiers, and this model is in the same range as the 411i Max I reviewed, which is currently topping our best air purifier buying guide. This is a particularly smart way to clear the air, thanks to simple-to-use controls and a user-friendly companion app. And now's a great time to buy as the price is discounted by almost $46 this Prime Day.\nThis mini purifying pal features as one of the best small air purifiers in our buying guide, and I scored it a commendable 4.5 stars in my review. It's compact, lightweight, and super easy to set up and use, and it's a bit of a bargain right now as this 25% Prime Day deal has knocked \u00a320 off the list price.\nIce, ice, baby\nTeaming your fan with an ice pack is a great way to enjoy some cooler air. One of the easiest ways to do this is to place a bowl of ice (cubes, or just go ahead and freeze a whole bowl of water, if you have the time) in front of your fan. You want to ensure the air flow is passing as close to the ice as possible, to maximize cooling.\nAlternatively, you could cut out the middle man and purchase an air cooler, which is a fan with an integrated compartment for water and/or ice blocks.\nThis evaporative air cooler features a removable water tank and ice packs, which, when used, can help to cool the air and help with humidity in drier climates. Right now, there's a generous 20% off the list price, which equals a saving of $36.\nThis remote control fan can also be used as a humidifier thanks to its 5L water tank capacity, and comes with ice packs that can be added to help cool the air as it passes through. And thanks to this Prime Day deal, there's a cool \u00a325 saving on offer right now.\nUse your fan wisely\nUnless ice packs are involved, a fan doesn\u2019t actually make the air any cooler; it just circulates it around. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t feel nice, they most certainly do, which is why I tend to have one pointed at me at all times on hotter days.\nFans do their best work when at night, however, using an air circulator when you have the windows open can really help to distribute the cooler air as the temperature drops. An extra tip is to open windows on opposite sides of the house to get a nice cross-breeze, too.\nAn air circulator would make a perfect purchase even if you\u2019re lucky enough to own an air conditioner, as they help to spread that cooled air further into the room.\nThe free-standing remote-controlled air circulator has three wind settings, is height-adjustable, and has a fun added feature in the form of an aroma pad that you can add fragrance to. You can save 15% today with this Prime Day offer.\nGreat for use indoors or outside, this cordless air circulator has an in-built battery and offers five fan speeds and oscillation. Right now, there's an impressive 40% discount on the table, equalling a huge saving of \u00a360, and making this a deal well worth taking advantage of.\nTake the LED\nOne tip is to switch up your bulbs for LED alternatives. This may sound silly, but anyone who still uses non-LED bulbs will know as well as I do that they can kick out a fair amount of heat. This may not be such a bother in the colder months, but it can make a surprising difference during a heatwave.\nLED bulbs are plentiful these days, so it\u2019s easy to make the switch, or it might be a bright idea to try out some of the best smart bulbs. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of an LED bulb, with the added bonus of building automations and routines. Smart bulbs with an adjustable color temperature prove particularly useful if you\u2019re feeling in the dark after closing the drapes, as you can brighten things up in a hue that suits you.\nThese smart bulbs can be quickly adapted to suit your mood at the touch of a button, or with the help of your smart home assistant. I've reviewed a lot of Govee lights, and I've made no secret of the fact that I adore the Govee Home app, as it's feature-packed and so easy to use, and I'm always very happy to see Govee lights on offer. This deal is a particularly sweet one, too, with a fabulous 40% off.\nThanks to the intuitive Govee Home app and their compatibility with smart home assistants, these bulbs can be quickly and easily fine-tuned to suit the situation. Govee smart lights are a fantastic budget alternative to Philips Hue, and this \u00a312 saving makes them even better value.\nStay hydrated\nTopping up your fluid intake is a must to avoid overheating in hot weather \u2013 and is highly advisable in general, as our bodies are much happier with us when we keep adequately hydrated.\nIf you\u2019re already up on your hydration and drink plenty of water, then this will be a no-brainer for you, but some of us need a little extra encouragement to stay on top of our liquid intake. This is where kitchen gadgets like a SodaStream are a game-changer, as it\u2019s much easier for me to stay on top of my hydration levels when I can make water fizzy and sweet.\nEnjoy bottles of bubblyness with the Terra sparkling water maker. If you're new to SodaStream, it's a nifty gadget that uses CO2 to make water fun and fizzy, no cords, and no batteries necessary. This Prime Day deal has knocked $40 off the list price, and applies to both the black and white models.\nSodaStream has been a popular household name for decades, and for good reason, as they make some great sparkling water makers. The Terra is one example, it's available in black or white, and features Quick Connect technology to make it easier to attach the CO2 cylinder, and Snap and Lock, so you don't have to faff about twisting and turning the bottle into place. This Prime Day, there's a massive 50% saving on offer, so you can get the Terra for \u00a355 less.\nAmazon's Prime Day sale in the US - quick links\n- Amazon Devices: 50% off TVs, Ring & Fire Sticks\n- Apple: AirPods + iPads from $99\n- Back to school: deals from $5.99\n- Beauty: 80% off toothbrushes & skincare\n- Headphones: $120 off Bose, Apple & Sony\n- Health: electric toothbrushes from $24.99\n- Kitchen: 54% off Ninja, Nespresso & Keurig\n- Laptops: record-low prices from $175\n- Tablets: iPads and Samsung from $54.99\n- Toys: 40% off Lego, scooters & Toniebox\n- TVs: cheap TVs from $59.99\n- Vacuums: Shark, Bissell & Dyson from $49.99\nAmazon's Prime Day sale in the UK - quick links\n- Amazon Devices: up to 50% off Echo & Ring\n- Appliances: Ninja & De'Longhi from \u00a329.99\n- Gaming: Nintendo Switch 2 \u2013 in stock now\n- Headphones: Anker & Sony from \u00a315.98\n- Health: up to 68% off Philips, Remington & Oral-B\n- Home: fans from \u00a312.99\n- Laptops: Lenovo, Asus and HP from \u00a3159.99\n- Phones: up to 20% off Apple & Samsung\n- Tablets: Lenovo & Samsung from \u00a3119\n- Toys: up to 50% off Lego & Mattel\n- TVs: cheap TVs from \u00a3109\n- Vacuums: Shark and eufy from \u00a399\n- Wearables: up to 25% off Huawei & Samsung\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nCesci is a Reviews Staff Writer for TechRadar.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad is perfectly balanced between price and performance. It offers excellent cooling, almost halving how much our laptop heated during testing. And yet despite this, it\u2019s cheaper than many of its closest rivals and not really any louder. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of its angular, gamer-baiting aesthetic; but I'm least concerned about its style when it delivers so highly in terms of substance\nPros\n- +\nExceptional cooling\n- +\nNo louder than it rivals\n- +\nVery reasonably priced\u2026\nCons\n- -\n... except in Australia\n- -\nNo RGB lighting\n- -\nUnapologetically gamer-styled design\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nLiangstar Laptop Cooling Pad review\nThe Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad is an affordable laptop cooling pad, designed to prevent your laptop from overheating during heavy gaming sessions or creative workflows. Given its price point, it would be reasonable to assume you\u2019ll get only moderate-weight cooling. But blow me down: its three 100mm fans, two 80mm fans and one 70mm fan help you secure some pretty cool running.\nI ran it through the 3DMark Stress Test on our Acer Predator Helios 300 with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, and the cooling it offered was genuinely pretty glacial. After running 15 minutes of running, the temperature of the laptop had risen from 22.2\u00baC to only 37.5\u00baC. That\u2019s a temperature rise of just 15.3\u00baC \u2013 and, in the time I've been testing laptop pads, is the most extreme cooling I\u2019ve seen. It's significantly better than the 31.9\u00baC warming I saw on our baseline test of the laptop alone.\nDespite being frostier than a penguin whose name you just blanked on, the Liangstar\u2019s fans are pretty quiet. Ten minutes into the test, I used a sound meter to measure noise \u2013 from a few inches away from the device and at my head height. At 59dB and 45dB respectively, the results weren\u2019t really any worse than any of the best laptop cooling pads I\u2019ve tested, and roughly equivalent to the noise the Acer Predator Helios 300 made on its own.\nWhen it comes to design, the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad is well put together, in that sharp, angular style common to a lot of gaming gear. Using it felt ergonomically comfortable; I was able to tilt it to the right angle for my wrists, while the flip-up rests didn\u2019t get in the way of using the trackpad or keyboard. Meanwhile, the monochrome lighting is a little more subtle than the RGB type common to many cooling pads \u2013 whether this is a positive or negative likely depends on your chromatic predilections, but I feel it\u2019s nice enough here. I\u2019m less keen on the tribal back tattoo at the bottom of the Liangstar, but maybe I\u2019m just not the target audience.\nWith its powerful performance, you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting this laptop cooling pad to be pricey. But it\u2019s actually competitively priced in most markets: the blue-lit version I tested retails for just $19.99 / \u00a320.99, although Australian readers will have to pay AU$66.91. In the US, you can also get red, white or multi-color lit versions for $22.49, $19.99 or $22.99 respectively. All told, this is a decent saving compared to the $29.99 / \u00a329.77 / AU$49.77 TopMate C12 Laptop Cooling Pad or $26.99 / \u00a321.99 Tecknet N5 Laptop Cooling Pad \u2013 despite the fact the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad offers superior cooling. So all told, if you care most about getting the best cooling for your cash, the Liangstar should be your go-to.\nLiangstar Laptop Cooling Pad review: price & availability\n- Released December 16, 2019\n- Current price of $19.99 / \u00a328.99 / AU$66.91\nFirst launched on December 16, 2019, the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad is currently available for $19.99 / \u00a320.99 / AU$66.91 from Amazon, with the US price being the lowest we\u2019ve ever seen it. There may be some fluctuations here, though: the MSRP in the UK is listed as \u00a328.99, yet prices have dropped as low as \u00a314.44, so it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on our price trackers, as you may be able to pick up even more of a bargain.\nHowever, even at Amazon\u2019s current prices, it undercuts most other products we\u2019ve tested. The only exception is if you\u2019re based in Australia \u2013 over there, the TopMate C12 Laptop Cooling Pad comes in cheaper at AU$49.77, but in tests I found its cooling less impressive than the Liangstar, meaning you may well find the extra AU$17.14 is a price worth paying.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nShould I buy the TopMate C12 Laptop Cooling Pad?\nBuy it if\u2026\nYou want the best cooling\nThus far, the Liangstar delivers the best cooling performance I\u2019ve seen from a laptop cooling pad at the affordable end of the market, keeping our testing laptop at a pretty balmy 37.5\u00baC during its intensive stress test.\nYou want an absolute bargain price\nEven compared to other affordable laptop cooling pads, the Liangstar is surprisingly cheap. It\u2019s priced much cheaper in the US and UK than many other cooling pads, despite the fact it offers superior cooling.\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026\nYou want specific styling\nThe Liangstar is neither fish nor fowl in terms of design. Without conspicuous RGB lighting, it may not have enough of a gamer vibe for the esports crowd, but its hard angles and tribal logo might be a bit much for creatives.\nYou\u2019re buying from Australia\nOK, this is less of a \"don\u2019t buy\" than it is a \"think before you buy\". The Liangstar has a bit of a markup in Australia, even more than we\u2019d expect from the exchange rate and extra shipping. So it's worth considering if it\u2019s as much as a bargain in your market.\nLiangstar Laptop Cooling Pad review: also consider\nTopMate C12 Laptop Cooling Pad\nThe TopMate C12 Laptop Cooling Pad can\u2019t quite rival the Liangstar for cooling \u2013 its temperature rise was 22.8\u00baC versus the Liangstar\u2019s 15.3\u00baC \u2013 but it does almost make up for it when it comes to cool points. Its customizable RGB lighting guarantees to give your gaming setup that extra pop, offering 10 different settings for its rainbow-hued LED trim. Read our full TopMate C12 Laptop Cooling Pad review.\nHow I tested the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad\n- Tested it over multiple days\n- Ran a stress test and measured temperature difference with a thermal camera\n- Recorded the volume of fan noise 10 minutes into test with a sound level meter\nTo test the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad, I carried out all of the standard benchmarks we run on laptop cooling pads. Firstly, I measured our Razer Predator Helios 300 with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 testing laptop\u2019s hottest point to set a baseline, then ran a 3DMark Stress Test for 15 minutes with the cooling pad set to its maximum setting and then remeasured the temperature.\nIn addition, I checked how much noise the device kicks out with a sound level meter. Once the test had been running for ten minutes, I recorded the sound levels from three inches away and from head height to get a sense of the immediate and subjective noise levels generated by the cooling pad and the laptop combined. I then contrasted this against the noise generated by the laptop\u2019s fans alone.\nAs well as this quantitative data, I made sure I got plenty of experience using the cooling pad so I could assess its ergonomics and how well it functions in practice. Here I benefited from the many years I\u2019ve spent testing gadgets as well as the 30 years I\u2019ve spent using gaming setups.\n- First reviewed: March 2025\n- Read more about how we test\nJosh is Reviews Editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "My dream MacBook Air M4 upgrade is finally a reality thanks to this wild $799 Amazon bargain deal\nHuge discount, svelte laptop\nOverdue an upgrade for your laptop? I feel you: with my aged MacBook Pro starting to look a little long in the tooth, I\u2019ve been considering my next move for a while now. Given the awesome amount of power it stores in its slender frame, I\u2019ve had my eye on the MacBook Air (M4). So I was very excited to see you can currently buy the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) from $799 (was $999) at Amazon US \u2013 and I honestly think you should be too.\nGiven it was released less than six months ago, this is a major chunk slashed off the Air M4\u2019s list price. And there are plenty of configurations available: as well as the base model with 16GB Unified Memory and a 256GB SSD, you can also get $200 off the models with 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD and 24GB RAM / 512GB, bringing them to $999 and $1,199, respectively. Not bad, given it\u2019s TechRadar\u2019s top pick as the best laptop out there right now.\nWant a larger screen for movie-watching or design work? Then you\u2019re in luck: you can also get the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) from $999 (was $1,199) at Amazon US. So if, like me, you\u2019ve been waiting for the perfect moment to upgrade your MacBook, that moment is here.\nToday's best MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) deal\nWith its 10-core CPU, 8-core or 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, and option of either 16GB or 24GB of integrated RAM, the only thing that\u2019s \u2018lightweight\u2019 about the MacBook Air M4 is its svelte frame. It\u2019s a portable powerhouse and, with this massive $200 discount, it offers an absurd amount of processing bang for your buck.\nIf you own a laptop of a certain age, this really is the perfect upgrade. To date, I\u2019ve not been in a huge rush to upgrade, as my MacBook Pro 13-inch (2017) has served me well. One of the things I love about Apple\u2019s laptops is their sheer staying power \u2013 my old MacBook Pro\u2019s power and its Methuselah-like longevity have stood me in good stead for years.\nBut 2017 was a long time ago. Donald Trump had barely been inaugurated as the 45th president when I bought it \u2013 something that feels like it was approximately four decades ago. And Apple\u2019s computing hardware has experienced a Singularity-esque leap forward in that time: my peers and I were raving about how absurdly fast the first M1 Apple silicon chip was back in 2020, and Apple estimates the M4 chip is at least twice as quick as its ancestor. Frankly, in comparison to modern Apple hardware, my old Intel-driven MacBook Pro looks positively creaky.\nThe MacBook Air M4 is a speedboat compared to my old laptop\u2019s paddle steamer, which is why we raved about it in our five-star MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) review. That SoC M4 chip comes with a 10-core CPU, your choice of an 8-core or 10-core GPU, and 16GB, 24GB, or 32GB integrated memory (although the latter isn\u2019t available in Amazon\u2019s deal). Coupled with Amazon\u2019s offer of a 256GB or 512GB SSD and the Air\u2019s sleek, super-portable design, it\u2019s hard not to be swayed by this deal.\nBut why am I not advocating you go Pro? Well, while it was once necessary for creatives like me to opt for Apple\u2019s punchier MacBook Pro line, that\u2019s really no longer the case. I\u2019m a music maker in my free time \u2013 while my old Pro is starting to wheeze and groan a lot when I\u2019m working with 50 tracks laden with modern, high-performance synths and effects, the MacBook Air M4 can handle this kind of workflow without breaking a sweat. That makes it a no-brainer for most artists, outside of professional studios.\nIf you still have a hankering for a new MacBook Pro, keep an eye on our guide to the best MacBook Pro deals for all the biggest savings available.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThere\u2019s no escaping it \u2013 the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad is one of the more expensive laptop cooling pads on the market, plus it also makes significantly more noise than some rivals. However, it also offers exceptional chilling, keeping your laptop at a moderate temperature even during heavy workloads. If performance is your biggest priority, this is an excellent choice.\nPros\n- +\nStaggering cooling\n- +\nComfortable and ergonomic\n- +\nSubtle design\nCons\n- -\nNoisy at higher settings\n- -\nPower cable is a bit short\n- -\nExpensive\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nLlano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad review\nThe Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad is a premium laptop cooling pad. Its huge 5.5-inch (140mm) fan is capable of spinning at up to dizzying 2,800rpm, meaning it should be perfect for chilling your CPU during heavy workloads. Cheap it certainly isn't, though: costing a cool $119.99 / \u00a3129.99 (around AU$190), it's an expensive cooling pad.\nHowever, in return for this princely sum, you get some glacial cooling. I ran a 3DMark Stress Test using our Acer Predator Helios 300 testing laptop with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. Before the test, the laptop\u2019s ambient temperature sat at 82F / 28C; after running the stress test for 15 minutes with the Llano in place at 2800rpm, the laptop had warmed to only 97F / 36C. That 15F / 8C rise is one of the most impressive results I\u2019ve seen in my time testing laptop cooling pads, and should definitely mean that your laptop will be remain nice and frosty during long gaming sessions.\nSo, on the plus side, the Llano is more frigid than a blizzard; the downside is it sounds like one, too, with its fans kicking out some gale-force noise. Ten minutes into my benchmarking tests, I used a noise level meter to gauge the sound kicked out by the laptop and the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad set to maximum \u2013 it recorded 64dB from head height and 79dB from only a few inches away. This is much louder than many of the best laptop cooling pads, and, according to the Center for Hearing and Communication, it's roughly the same volume as a small blender, so you likely won\u2019t be popular using this in an office environment.\nOverall, the design of the Llano is tastefully done \u2013 there are no aggressively sharp angles of the type often seen on gaming accessories, and the RGB lighting is restricted to a single, modest bar around the cooling pad's edge; there are four lighting modes you can cycle through. Note that I did find the power cable a little on the short side: my power socket is just to the left of my desk, but the cable plugs in on the right-hand side of the device, which was more of a stretch.\nErgonomically, the Llano Cooling Pad is well thought-out, too: its slope ensure wrists are held at the perfect angle, and its three different height settings should make it easy for you to find the optimum slope for your needs. Be aware that the laptop rests do come very close to sitting exactly where you\u2019ll want to lay your wrists, though \u2013 I\u2019m not sure why so many brands think right below the WASD keys is the perfect place for a jutting piece of plastic; but it's a common problem with laptop cooling pads.\nDespite this, the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad is a fantastic piece of kit, capable of delivering pretty extreme cooling \u2013 and looking good while it does it. Yes, it sounds like an idling jet engine, and getting such performance will cost you a pretty penny. However, it will do an astounding job of keeping your laptop cool during demanding tasks, so if you have the money spare, you really can\u2019t go wrong with it.\nLlano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad review: price & availability\n- Released July 30, 2023\n- List price of $119.99 / \u00a3129.99 (around AU$190)\nOriginally released on July 30, 2023, the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad retails for $119.99 / \u00a3129.99 (around AU$190) on Amazon. However, it's occasionally available for less: at the time of writing, it was reduced to $92.79 in the US \u2013 its lowest ever price. It also dropped down to \u00a3103.99 in October in the UK, so it's worth keeping your eyes peeled for potential discounts.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAt its full price, the Llano definitely comes in at the premium end of the market, dwarfing the price of affordable cooling pads such as the $19.99 / \u00a320.99 Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad. But on the flip side, it offers far better cooling \u2013 some budget options saw our testing laptop temperatures rise by over 68F / 20C, while it was just 46F / 8C with the Llano. For high-intensity gaming or creative work, you may well find that extra spend is well worth it.\nShould I buy the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad?\nBuy it if\u2026\nYou want icy cooling\nEven during an intensive CPU workout, this laptop cooling pad kept our testing laptop from warming any more than single digits \u2013 that\u2019s positively polar cooling.\nYou want comfortable, ergonomic design\nWith three height settings, it\u2019s easy to find the perfect angle to support your wrists while using this laptop cooling pad. And its memory foam pad and laptop rests keep your laptop firmly in place.\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026\nYou can\u2019t handle a bit of noise\nThe Llano is no shrinking violet: when it\u2019s hard at work, you\u2019ll definitely hear it. When it\u2019s running at its peak speed of 2800rpm, it hits around 80dB, which is about as loud as a garbage disposal or dishwasher.\nYou want an explicit gamer aesthetic\nWhile it features stylish RGB lighting, this laptop cooling pad is still pretty discreet. If you fancy something with a much more in-your-face gamer look, you\u2019ll probably want to look elsewhere.\nLlano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad review: also consider\nLiangstar Laptop Cooling Pad\nIf your budget won't stretch that far, my current pick for affordable laptop cooling pads would have to be the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad. In the same benchmarking tests run on the Llano, the Liangstar saw our laptop temperature rise from 22.2\u00baC to 37.5\u00baC \u2013 a rise of just 15.3\u00baC. Not bad, given it costs just $19.99 / \u00a320.99 / AU$66.91. Read our full Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad review.\nHow I tested the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad\n- Tested the cooling pad over several days\n- Measured the device\u2019s cooling during a stress test on a gaming laptop\n- Used a sound level meter to assess how much noise it made\nWhen testing the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad, I ran it through TechRadar\u2019s standard benchmarking tests. First, I used a thermal camera to record the temperature of the hottest point of our Acer Predator Helios 300 with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 testing laptop as a baseline. I then ran a 3DMark Stress Test for 15 minutes with the Llano dialled up to its maximum cooling, before recording its new temperature.\nI also used a sound level meter to check how much noise the device kicks out while running. Once our stress test had been underway for 10 minutes, I checked the volume of the combined noise of the laptop and cooling pad from a few inches away and from head height. I then compared this to the noise generated by the laptop\u2019s fans alone, when it wasn\u2019t being cooled.\nOn top of all of this benchmarking data, I made sure I got plenty of experience using the laptop cooler, to assess factors such as comfort, stability and ergonomics. Here I was helped by many years of experience reviewing gadgets and several decades spent gaming on laptops.\n- First reviewed: April 2025\n- Read more about how we test\nJosh is Reviews Editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "I'm TechRadar\u2019s reviews editor \u2013 these are my top three laptop cooling pads for keeping your laptop chill during heatwaves\nPerfect pads for helping your laptop beat the heat\nWith the weather set to hit over 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) this week in many places on either side of the Atlantic, it\u2019s not hard to see how a cooling pad might be a literal lifesaver for your laptop. Helping its internal cooling system keep its core components frosty, they\u2019re incredibly helpful during demanding gaming sessions \u2013 and absolutely invaluable during heatwaves when the mercury in your thermometer is a few degrees off boiling.\nYour laptop always generates some heat when running, but it\u2019s when you\u2019re starting to push its limits that it\u2019s most likely to become a problem. The harder you\u2019re working its core components, the warmer they will get, until they start to outstrip your laptop's built-in cooling capacity \u2013 and you\u2019ll hit this point much faster if ambient temperatures are much higher. With its powerful fans, a cooling pad can improve how rapidly your laptop can dissipate heat and massively reduce the stress this places on its components.\nAs TechRadar\u2019s reviews editor, I not only developed our testing process for the best laptop cooling pads, but I\u2019ve also tested many of them firsthand. That\u2019s given me unparalleled insight into which products you can most depend on to help your portable gaming rig or creative powerhouse beat the heat. So there\u2019s a handful of products I\u2019d happily recommend if you\u2019re wanting to keep your laptop chill even during the hottest days of the year.\n1. Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad\nIn my book, the Llano RGB Cooling Pad is flat-out the leading light among laptop cooling pads. Rather than aggressive gamer styling, it offers smooth curves and a subtle RGB light bar around its middle. Meanwhile, the design is comfortable to use, offering plenty of room to rest your wrists while holding your laptop at a comfortable, ergonomic angle.\nMore importantly, it blasts out air like Louis Armstrong trying to blow out trick candles during a trumpet solo. While conducting a 15-minute 3DMark stress test on our Acer Predator Helios gaming laptop, I set the Llano to max fan speed and measured how much the laptop\u2019s temperature rose over 15 minutes. Thanks to the Llano\u2019s dizzying 2800rpm top fan speed, it rose just 14.4\u00b0F (8\u00b0C), easily the most modest heating I\u2019ve ever seen from a cooling pad I\u2019ve tested.\nNaturally, there\u2019s a price to be paid for this arctic cooling. First off, a fan spinning that fast is inevitably on the loud side, hitting 79dB when measured with a sound level meter at close range \u2013 that\u2019s nearing the volume of a small blender. And secondly, it\u2019ll cost you: at $119.99 / \u00a3129.99 (around AU$190), it\u2019s hardly the cheapest pad on the market. However, if you want the absolute best cooling you\u2019re likely to experience, the din and the extra dough are well worth it.\nRead my full Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad review.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n2. Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad\nIf you\u2019re not quite ready to drop over $100 / \u00a3100 to turn your laptop into an ice cream bar, I\u2019d argue the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad is going to be your best alternative. Assuming you can look beneath the surface of its edgy design, there\u2019s a lot of the cut-glass angles you tend to see with gaming accessories, and Liangstar has inexplicably given it a tribal lower-back tattoo \u2013 it\u2019s actually an impressive piece of kit.\nRunning it through our standard cooling test, the Liangstar only saw the peak temperature of TechRadar\u2019s laptop rise 28.4\u00b0F (15.3\u00b0C) \u2013 while that\u2019s a decent amount more than the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad, it\u2019s better than pretty much any other budget cooling pad I\u2019ve tested so far and much better than the 57.4\u00b0F (31.9\u00b0C) the laptop heated unaided. It\u2019s also not significantly louder than its rivals and much quieter than the Llano above, measuring a more muted 59dB from a few inches away.\nYou\u2019d think such robust performance would attract a more demanding price tag. However, Liangstar\u2019s cost is seriously competitive. The blue-lit edition I tested retails for just $19.99 / \u00a320.99 / AU$66.91, which is an enormous saving when compared to Llano\u2019s pads. Fundamentally, if you\u2019re not looking to make an enormous investment, I cannot fault the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad \u2013 it offers a whole lot of cooling for your cash.\nRead my full Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad review.\n3. Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad gets a full-throated recommendation from me. During my benchmarking tests, it performed admirably, with our testing laptop only registering 21.6\u00b0F (12\u00b0C) of warming after the 15-minute stress test \u2013 the second-best result I\u2019ve found so far. While it\u2019s hardly the quietest fan on the market, at 69dB it is at least quieter than the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling pad, putting it more in line with highway traffic than heavy equipment.\nLlano has deployed a similarly understated design here as with its stablemate above. Rather than all the severe angles, flashing lights, and paint splatters that some gaming hardware exhibits, the V10 instead offers restrained curves and a tasteful light band along the edges. Its feet only offer one height setting, which props your laptop up at 10 degrees, but I found this comfortable to lean on for lengthy periods of time.\nThe only real drawbacks to the Llano V10 are two things I\u2019ve already mentioned: the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad and the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad. With the former offering such fantastic cooling and the latter such good value, the V10 is squeezed on both sides by attractive options, slightly diminishing its utility in comparison. Still, if you can\u2019t quite stretch to the full price of the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad, this will give you access to silver-level refrigeration that the Liangstar can\u2019t quite reach.\nRead my full Llano V10 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad review.\nYou might also like\n- Want to check out all the other options available?

Detail is the whole point of 4K \u2013 most of the time, you won\u2019t be able to see the pixels in a 4K display, so everything looks natural and sharp. It\u2019s great for photos, videos and gaming for this reason, but actually it\u2019s superior for just about everything \u2013 it\u2019s nicer when text looks smoother on a computer, for example.\nThe vast majority of the time, 4K refers to a specific resolution of 3840 x 2160 (which is also known as \u2018Ultra HD\u2019) \u2013 this is the resolution of all 4K TVs and 4K video streams from the likes of Netflix or YouTube. Some cameras record in what\u2019s often known as \u2018Cinema 4K\u2019, which is a resolution of 4096 x 2160. You may find that some computer monitors refer to themselves as 4K, and will have a horizontal resolution around 4,000 pixels, but have a different height to the resolutions mentioned above, such as ultra-wide monitors. The width is what makes something 4K or not.\nYou\u2019ll mostly see 4K referred to in TVs of 40 inches and above, in computer and laptop monitors, on video streaming services, and in video recording on cameras or phones.\nLatest about 4K\nI tested the Samsung S95F and LG G5 OLED TVs side-by-side: here's which one you should get\nBy James Davidson published\nIt's Samsung Vs LG in the battle of premium OLED TVs in 2025\nI love 4K Blu-ray, and these are the 6 discs I want to treat myself to on my birthday\nBy James Davidson published\n4K Blu-rays and my birthday go hand-in-hand: here's the discs I'll be hoping to add to my collection\nThe best TV, chosen by our reviewers for all budgets\nBy Al Griffin last updated\nTop OLED and QLED sets to consider, from elite TVs to wallet-friendly options \u2013 all tested by us.\nThe 13 best PS4 Pro games to play in 2025\nBy Rob Dwiar last updated\nGet the most out of Sony's enhanced console from last gen with one of the best PS4 Pro games.\nDell Pro 32 Plus business monitor review\nBy Collin Probst published\nThe Dell Pro 32 Plus packs 32 inches of beautiful 4K picture at 100Hz, decent ports, Native Mac compatibility, and a brightness that caps at 350 nits.\nThis 34-inch business monitor is curved, fast, has Ethernet, Smart KVM, and a webcam \u2014 shame there\u2019s no 5K option for creative users\nBy Wayne Williams published\nAOC's 34-inch curved WQHD panel features Ethernet, Smart KVM, a webcam, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nThe best 75-inch TVs, all tested by our big-screen experts\nBy Al Griffin last updated\nUpdated The best 75-inch TVs offer a true big-screen experience, with a size befitting the greatest films and the most nail-biting sports matches.\nThere's a huge Criterion Collection 4K Blu-ray sale happening at Amazon ahead of Prime Day \u2013 here are the 5 movies I'd pick\nBy James Davidson published\nMajor savings of the best 4k Blu-rays you can add to your collection\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more."

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Klim Wind isn\u2019t a bad laptop cooling pad necessarily, but it doesn\u2019t do a lot to distinguish itself either. It\u2019s impressively quiet, although only fractionally more so than its closest rivals, while its looks are pretty average. But its cooling is where it really struggles to stand out: the chilling it\u2019s capable of is very much at the lower end of products I\u2019ve tested. Given that it\u2019s outstripped by many products that cost pretty much the same, it\u2019s hard to recommend it over more capable rivals.\nPros\n- +\nSuper quiet\n- +\nAffordable\n- +\nRelatively ergonomic\nCons\n- -\nUnderwhelming cooling\n- -\nLooks and feels a bit cheap\n- -\nBetter options available for the same price\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nKlim Wind laptop cooling pad: review\nThe Klim Wind is a laptop cooling pad that's very much aimed at the average gamer. While it may not have the oomph required by pro esports players or creative studios, it\u2019s aimed at those who just want to stop their CPUs cooking while playing Cyberpunk 2077.\nIt rocks four fans capable of spinning at up to 1200rpm and comes in a range of colorways, and it\u2019s available from Amazon from just $19.97 / \u00a319.97 / AU$49.97.\nA big selling point of the Klim Wind is how quiet it is. In fact, the packaging describes it as \u2018ultra silent\u2019, which is a) redundant, given that something is either silent or it isn\u2019t; and b) not actually true.\nHowever, its fan noise is impressively muted \u2013 during testing, the combined noise of its fans at 1200rpm and the inbuilt cooling of our Acer Predator Helios 300 testing laptop with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU only registered as 58.5dB from a few inches away and 44dB from my head height. That\u2019s pretty much as quiet as any laptop cooling pad I\u2019ve tested.\nI feel a little lukewarm about the Klim\u2019s design. On the one hand, its 16-degree angle is comfortable enough, even if I wish it had a few different height settings, and its blue LED lighting feels nicely understated. On the other, its build quality isn\u2019t as high as some of the best laptop cooling pads, feeling a bit light and plasticky, while the flip-up laptop rests jabbed at my wrists when I was resting them on my laptop. Also, with all its notches and sharp angles, its looks are a bit on the nose \u2013 it looks like a cyber-goth butterfly, which is distinctly less charming than it sounds.\nBut all of this comes second to its core functionality \u2013 if it offers game-changing cooling, does anyone care what it looks like? Unfortunately, the Klim Wind does little to redeem itself here. The cooling it offers is, frankly, mediocre.\nUsing our testing laptop, I ran a 15-minute 3DMark stress test with the Wind on its max 1200rpm fan speed, measuring how much the laptop\u2019s temperature changed. It increased from 85F / 29.5C to 120F / 49C, a 35F / 19.5C rise, which is the weakest cooling I\u2019ve seen from any cooling pad I\u2019ve tested, aside from the TopMate C12 Laptop Cooling Pad\u2019s 22.8C.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn light of this, I can\u2019t really recommend the Klim Wind \u2013 there are simply too many similarly priced options that will keep your laptop cooler. The best cooling I\u2019ve personally tested comes from the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad, which I can't recommend highly enough, although its $119.99 / \u00a3129.99 (around AU$188.33) price tag won\u2019t suit everyone\u2019s budget.\nIf value is your biggest priority, the Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad is a great option; it\u2019s nearly as frosty as the Llano but costs just $19.99 / \u00a320.99 / AU$66.91, which makes it a bit of a bargain in my book.\nKlim Wind laptop cooling pad review: price & availability\n- Available now\n- Retails from $19.97 / \u00a319.97 / AU$49.97\n- Wide range of colorways available\nThe Klim Wind is available from Amazon now. It retails for as little as $19.97 / \u00a319.97 / AU$49.97, which will get you the blue-lit version we tested here. Although it has historically been reduced as low as \u00a314.90 in the UK, this was way back in December 2019, while the price has never been lower stateside, so we\u2019d argue you\u2019re unlikely to get a better price for this now.\nIf black with blue lighting isn\u2019t your thing, there are plenty of other, pricier colorways to choose from. Including options with red, cyan or green LED lighting, white metal and plastic or even an additional RGB strip, these max out at $29.97 / \u00a329.97 / AU$149.97.\nShould I buy the Klim Wind laptop cooling pad?\nBuy it if\u2026\nYou like accessories that are oh so quiet\nThe Klim Wind is as quiet as any laptop cooling pad we\u2019ve tested. At 44dB from 21 inches away, it\u2019s barely any noisier than most libraries, according to the Center for Hearing and Communication.\nYou don\u2019t want to spend too much\nLaptop cooling pads don\u2019t get much cheaper than the Klim Wind, which sells from $19.97 / \u00a319.97 / AU$49.97 on Amazon. So it\u2019s definitely competitively priced.\nDon't buy it if\u2026\nYou want significant cooling\nUnfortunately, its four 1200rpm fans simply can\u2019t cut the heat as well as those on other products. Other products managed to keep our laptop\u2019s temperature lower for essentially the same list price.\nYou\u2019re not keen on edgy gamer styling\nStyle is individual and you might be a fan of angular, industrial gaming rigs and brutalist, sharp-edged accessories. If you\u2019re not though, the look of this product likely won\u2019t appeal.\nKlim Wind laptop cooling pad review: also consider\nLlano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad\nFor truly arctic cooling, no product gets my stamp of approval more than the Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad. Even during our 3DMark stress test, it was able to limit our testing laptop\u2019s temperature rise to just 8C and it looks seriously classy, with its quality build and tasteful RGB lighting. It does sound like a jet engine and comes at a premium price but few laptop cooling pads can rival its prodigious cooling. Read our full Llano RGB Laptop Cooling Pad review.\nLiangstar Laptop Cooling Pad\nOkay, it\u2019s no Llano. But given it limited our laptop\u2019s temperature rise to just 59.5F / 15.3C during stress testing, this still absolutely edges out the Klim Wind in terms of sheer sangfroid. Despite this, it retails for pretty much the same price, costing just $19.99 / \u00a320.99 / AU$66.91. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap laptop chiller, you\u2019ll struggle to find one that\u2019s better value. Read our full Liangstar Laptop Cooling Pad review.\nHow I tested the Klim Wind laptop cooling pad\n- Tested over the course of two days\n- Recorded how much the product cooled our gaming laptop during a stress test\n- Checked the volume of its fans using a sound level meter\nI tested the Klim Wind using TechRadar\u2019s standard laptop cooling pad testing process. First off, I used a thermal camera to measure the peak temperature of our Razer Predator Helios 300 with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 testing laptop to establish a baseline. Then I ran a 3DMark stress test on the laptop for 15 minutes with the laptop cooling pad set to maximum speed, before recording its final temperature so I could compare its cooling against other products.\nTo test the amount of sound it generated, I used a noise level meter to check the combined noise of the cooling pad and the laptop\u2019s fans. I took two measurements, one from a few inches away and one from my head height (21 inches away) to get a sense of the absolute and subjective noise levels the device makes. I also used the laptop cooling pad in a range of scenarios, from gaming to day to day work to assess how ergonomic and comfortable it was.\nI have plenty of experience to help support my testing. Not only have I reviewed a wide range of laptop cooling pads for TechRadar, I\u2019ve also been a creative and an avid gamer for years, meaning I\u2019m familiar with the struggle of trying to keep a laptop cool during very CPU-intensive tasks.\n- First reviewed: May 2025\n- Read more about how we test\nJosh is Reviews Editor at TechRadar.
