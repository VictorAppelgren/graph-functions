  "title": "Hundreds turn out for Perth protests over asylum hotels",
  "description": "About 150 protestors and 250 counter protestors held signs and chanted outside of the Radisson Blu hotel.",
  "content": "Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Perth, both against and in support of asylum seekers being housed in hotels in the city. About 150 protestors gathered outside of the Radisson Blu hotel on the city's Leonard Street, chanting and holding signs including the slogan \"get them out\". Meanwhile about 250 people took part in a counter protest across the street, unfurling a banner which read \"no to racism\" and \"refugees welcome\". There is a large police presence outside the hotel near the Perth Railway Station car park and the two sides are separated by police.\n\nSeveral other demonstrations against asylum seekers being housed in hotels are taking place across the UK. Ahead of the Perth protests, the council's community safety partnership accused some of spreading misinformation about asylum seekers, saying those protesting \"under the guise of public safety or protection, do so with no local factual evidence\". It also said there had been no community safety issues with asylum seekers accommodated in Perth.\n\nSeparately, Perth and Kinross Council party leaders issued a joint statement ahead of the protest saying that welcoming refugees was \"part of our history and who we are\". It said: \"We defend the right to peaceful protest, but protests targeted at those who in many cases have lost their homes and family members to war, does not reflect the compassion, solidarity and fairness our communities are known for. \"That is why we are asking all residents to look beyond the misleading headlines and misinformation and treat those seeking refuge in our area the same way they would hope to be treated.\" Protests against hotels being used for asylum accommodation are also taking place on Saturday in Bristol, Exeter, Tamworth, Cannock, Nuneaton, Liverpool, Wakefield, Newcastle, Horley in Surrey and Canary Wharf in central London. Police Scotland said it was aware of planned protests in Perth, Stirling and Aberdeen. A spokesperson added: \"We will have appropriate resources in place to ensure the safety of those in attendance and mitigate disruption to the wider community.\"\n\nSimilar protests have been taking place across the UK over the last month, though on much larger scales. The demonstrations began at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, after a man living in the hotel was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in the town. Several hundred people - and on one occasion 2,000 according to Essex Police - have gathered near the Bell to protest, as well as many other hotels around the UK. The protests have been promoted on social media under red, white and blue banner text with slogans such as \"Protect Our Community\", \"Safety of Women and Children Before Foreigners\" and \"All Patriots Welcome\". They are often organised by people with little experience of street campaigning, including mothers with families and professional careers. The BBC has identified far-right activists at some of the protests. Meanwhile the anti-racism charity Stand Up To Racism described demonstrators outside a former hotel in Falkirk last weekend as \"extremists\". At least one protester was seen performing a Nazi salute while another carried a banner that said \"Kill 'Em All, Let God Sort 'Em Out\". An FOI request published on the Perth and Kinross Council website, external revealed that two hotels in the council area were used to house 191 asylum seekers as of 14 August. However these were not named in order to prevent the hotels from being targeted. Hotel accommodation for asylum seekers is managed by Mears Group on behalf of the Home Office, which meets the full costs of rooms, meals and financial allowances.",

      "text": "Campaigners say anti-asylum hotel protesters are 'extremists'\n- Published\nAn anti-racism group has hit out at \"extremists\" who took part in a protest against asylum seekers being housed in a former hotel in Falkirk.\nHundreds gathered outside the Cladhan Hotel on Saturday - at least one protester was seen performing a Nazi salute while another carried a banner that said \"Kill 'Em All, Let God Sort 'Em Out\".\nOrganisers, a Facebook group called Save Our Future and Our Kids Futures, said it had \"no affiliation\" with far-right protesters at the event.\nAnti-racism protesters staged a counter-demonstration, including the group Stand Up To Racism which said the far right \"poses a direct threat to life and safety in Scotland\".\nThe hotel is managed by Mears Group on behalf of the Home Office, which meets the full costs of accommodation, meals and financial allowances for asylum seekers.\nPolice closed the road for several hours as a result of the demonstrations and two men were arrested.\nA 23-year-old was charged over a report of indecent exposure and a 26-year-old was charged with obstructing police.\n- Published8 August\n- Published5 days ago\n- Published25 November 2021\nProtesters, some waving Union flags, chanted \"send them home\" and anti-racism demonstrators responded with chants of \"refugees are welcome here\" and \"this is what community looks like\".\nGary Clark, from Falkirk Trade Union Council, said he saw \"some really awful sights\" at the event.\nMr Clark, who uses a mobility scooter, said he had anti-disabled abuse shouted at him as he made a speech.\nHe told BBC Scotland's Mornings programme that he saw \"neo-Nazi groups openly displaying banners.\"\nHe said: \"The police has to escort us around the corner to stop them attacking us.\n\"Their faces were pure anger, and hatred was written on their faces.\"\nHe said the trade unions wanted to engage with the community and \"tackle their fears in a correct manner.\"\nHe said: \"There were many concerned locals there, I'm not going to hide that fact.\"\nHe referred to the case of Sadeq Nikzad, an asylum seeker from Afghanistan, who was jailed for nine years in June for raping a 15-year-old girl in Falkirk town centre in 2023.\nHe said: \"What I would say is, just because one person is done for a sexual offence you can't label them all.\"\n\"There's a lot of people who have been through a lot to get to this country, been through war, terror, and we have to look after them.\"\nConnor Graham, from Save Our Future and Our Kids Futures, told the programme that group members are \"definitely not extremists\", and are not racist or far-right.\nHe said: \"We're just local people who want to protect our community.\"\nMr Graham said he \"completely condemned\" the banner, saying he \"could not control\" who turned up to a public event.\nHe said: \"These other people who have turned up with the flags that they did, all I can do is ask them not to appear with that kind of stuff in the future.\"\nHe said he wanted \"openness and honesty about who is being housed in our community\" and that further protests were being planned.\n'Need for unity'\nStand Up to Racism Scotland said the counter-protest \"reflected the true community of Falkirk\" and included trade unions, faith groups, LGBT+ organisations, and refugee rights advocates, \"all united in peaceful opposition to racist hate.\"\nThe group accused some demonstrators of launching flares and missiles at the counter protest, and of shouting \"vile sexist abuse\".\nA spokesperson said: \"Saturday's events are a stark warning: the far-right poses a direct threat to life and safety in Scotland.\n\"The events in Falkirk show the urgent need for unity to prevent the far-right from spreading hate and putting lives at risk.\"\nThe rallies follow similar protests and counter-protests in Aberdeen earlier this month.\nAbout 40 people protested against asylum seekers outside the former Patio Hotel on 9 August, with about 200 anti-racism protesters attending.\nThe event had been previously publicised on social media.\nThere were no reports of arrests amid a heavy police presence.\nAnother hotel in the Summerhill area of Aberdeen was also subject to a recent protest.\nHow many asylum seekers are there in Scotland?\nAs of March this year, there were around 6,000 asylum seekers in Scotland, with the majority (4,152) living in Glasgow.\nA range of accommodation is used to house people while their asylum applications are being processed but most are in some form of longer-term, self-catering accommodation.\nAccording to the Home Office, hotels are \"contingency accommodation\" and only meant to be used for asylum seekers when other housing cannot be sourced.\nAs of March, 18 local authority areas in Scotland were housing 1,352 asylum seekers in hotels.\nThis is up from ten councils housing 662 people in hotels as of June, 2023.\nFalkirk had 79 asylum seekers living in hotels, as of March.\nThe increase in use of hotels reflects the UK government's backlog in processing asylum applications, wider housing shortages and pressure from other schemes such as accommodating thousands of refuges from Ukraine.\nFalkirk Council said it would work constructively with community groups and partners including police on the issue of community safety.\nIt pointed out its homelessness service has no involvement or contact with those in the Cladhan Hotel after false claims emerged online."

      "text": "The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 gives everyone the legal right to see information held by the Council, unless there is a good reason to withhold it.\nMaking a Freedom of Information request\nYou can make a request for information under the terms of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 by emailing FOI@pkc.gov.uk or by writing to the FOI team.\nYou need to tell us your real name, and give us a description of the information you want to see. You don't need to tell us why you want the information.\nWe are happy to advise you on how to obtain the information you're looking for; please feel free to contact us for guidance. You can also look at the Council's Publication Scheme for details of information which is made available routinely.\nResponding to your request\nWe will acknowledge your request when we receive it, and respond within 20 working days. If you do not receive an acknowledgment of your request, please contact us by emailing FOI@pkc.gov.uk or telephoning 01738 477933 to ensure that it has been received.\nIf we don't hold the information you've requested, or if we decide to withhold it, we will advise you of this. If you disagree with our response you have the right to ask us to review our decision (PDF, 203 KB). If you are still unhappy after a review, you can appeal to the Scottish Information Commissioner.\nEnvironmental information\nRequests for environmental information are dealt with under the Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004. You don't need to tell us if you consider your request to be environmental information; the FOI team will do this.\nRequests for personal information\nIf you would like to access personal data that the Council holds about you, you can make a Subject Access Request. View our Accessing your information - Subject Access Requests page or email DataProtection@pkc.gov.uk for further details.\nDisclosure log\nFrequently Asked Questions in relation to asylum seekers and refugees in the Perth and Kinross Council area\nThe names of any hotel(s)/temporary accommodation in Perth and Kinross Council area which are or have been used to house asylum seekers\nThere are two hotels in the Perth and Kinross Council area which are used to house asylum seekers. However, I consider that information relating to the names of these hotels is exempt information under the terms of Section 35 (1) (a) of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, which states that Information is exempt if.... its disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice substantially the prevention or detection of crime.\nIn applying this exemption, I am required to consider the public interest. In doing so, I have considered the following-\n- The general presumption in favour of disclosure\n- The current public and political interest in issues surrounding refugees and asylum seekers. However\n- I note the very serious disturbances that have occurred in other cities within the UK as a consequence of misinformation relating to refugees and asylum seekers.\n- There is a public interest in ensuring that all citizens within our local authority area feel safe and able to access services to which they are entitled, free from discrimination.\n- There is also a public interest in maintaining good law and order within our local authority area.\nI consider that there is a significant probability that the disclosure of the information requested into the public domain could lead to public disorder. I therefore consider that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\nThe number of asylum seekers housed each year in these hotel(s)\nThe current population of people seeking asylum within the two hotels is 191 (figure as at 14 August 2025). Please be advised that this figure fluctuates as individuals receive decisions on their asylum claims and move out of the hotel accommodation. Since November 2021, the Council receives fortnightly updates from Mears Group plc (the Home Office's hotel support provider) as to the current figures.\nPlans to accommodate more asylum seekers in the area, or to commission more hotel(s) to accommodate them\nThe Council has a weekly meeting with the Home Office to discuss arrangements for asylum seekers within Perth and Kinross and you will be aware that there are already a number based in two hotels in Perth. Where a need for more accommodation is identified, the Home Office, and its partner Mears Group plc, must request the assistance of the local authority to find accommodation and a full assessment needs to be made prior to any further accommodation being recommended to the Home Office. No such assessment has been requested or undertaken in relation to any hotel or other property in the area. Consequently, any rumours which are being circulated at present are completely untrue. In terms of section 17(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, this is formal notice that this information is not held by Perth and Kinross Council.\nDetails of refugees in the Perth and Kinross Council area\nPlease see below details of the Resettlement Schemes, the number of refugees resettled, and the year of arrival in the Perth and Kinross area.\n| Resettlement scheme | Number of people | Arrival date |\n|---|---|---|\n| Afghan Reallocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) and Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) | 19 | 2021/2022 |\n| Homes for Ukraine Scheme | 350 | 2022 |\n| Sudan United Kingdom Resettlement Scheme (UKRS) | 4 | 2023/2024 |\n| Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) | 7 | 2024/2025 |\n*Please note the figure for the Homes for Ukraine Scheme is the known population in Perth and Kinross which is taken from a live dataset and is correct as of 12 May 2025\nThe amount of funding received by Perth and Kinross Council from the UK and Scottish Government to support the resettlement and community integration of refugees\nIn the last 5 years, Perth & Kinross Council has received around \u00a35.6 million from the UK and Scottish Governments for this activity. Most of this funding is associated with supporting people displaced by the conflict in Ukraine.\nSpecifically, please see the table below detailing the amount received by Perth and Kinross Council from the UK Government as part of the Refugee Resettlement Schemes:\n| Financial Year | Amount of Funding (\u00a3) |\n|---|---|\n| 2021/2022 | \u00a3115,338 |\n| 2022/2023 | \u00a3125,600 |\n| 2023/2024 | \u00a396,087 |\n| 2024/2025 | \u00a365,779 |\nThe cost of accommodating asylum seekers in the Perth and Kinross Council area\nNo council tax funding, or any other kind of Council funding, is used to pay for the accommodation or placement of asylum seekers. The Home Office commissions and pays for the accommodation of asylum seekers in the Perth and Kinross Council area. In terms of section 17(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, this is formal notice that this information is not recorded by Perth and Kinross Council. I can advise that details of how to make a request for information to the Home Office can be found here\nFunding received by Perth and Kinross Council to assist with costs for supporting asylum seekers\nThe Home Office has made funding available to local authorities in England, Wales, and Scotland from the 1 April 2025 to assist with eligible expenditure costs of supporting Asylum Seekers in asylum accommodation.\nThe Council has received the following funding so far (as of 14 August 2025):\n| Financial Year | Amount of Funding (\u00a3) |\n|---|---|\n| 2025/2026 | \u00a3231,000 (+\u00a353,000 carried forward from 2024/2025) |\nThis has been allocated as follows:\n| Area | Funding Allocated |\n|---|---|\n| Health and Wellbeing - Supporting health checks and GP registration | \u00a341,502 |\n| Health and Wellbeing - Trauma support initiatives | \u00a36,500 |\n| English Language and Education | \u00a344,128 |\n| Employability skills and welfare support projects | \u00a315,030 |\n| Digital inclusion project | \u00a323,000 |\n| Housing Move on Support | \u00a398,000 |\n| Communities and Social Connections Projects | \u00a314,569.20 |\n| Legal/cultural integration advice project | \u00a32,000 |\nThe nationality of those who applied for and who were granted either social housing or temporary accommodation by your local authority\nWe can advise Perth and Kinross Council does not hold the information requested in the format requested. This is because we do not hold nationality data for housing applicants or for Perth and Kinross Council tenants in housing properties, nor do we hold this information for other social housing providers.\nTherefore, in terms of section 17(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, this is formal notice that this information is not recorded.\nWe can advise we ask for ethnicity information at the application stage however, these questions are not mandatory, and a large number of applicants choose not to answer these questions.\nDetails of asylum seekers or refugees awaiting the outcome of their housing application\nWe can advise Perth and Kinross Council do not hold this information. Asylum seekers are not eligible for housing or homelessness assistance from the local authority. The Home Office is responsible for accommodating Asylum Seekers. For your convenience you can contact the Home Office's information management team by accessing their website here. If their asylum claim is successful, they are usually awarded 'humanitarian protection' or 'refugee' status, at which point they become eligible for housing and homelessness assistance and social housing.\nRefugees that are resettled in Perth and Kinross through formal humanitarian protection schemes arrive in a planned way and move directly into settled accommodation.\nIn terms of section 17(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 this is formal notice that the information you have requested is not recorded by Perth and Kinross Council.\nDetails of inspections carried out on asylum accommodation by Environmental Health Officers\n| Year | Number of Inspections | Issues Identified | Notices Issued |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2023 | 2 | One kitchen drainage issue identified - which has been resolved | 0 |\n| 2024 | 0 | None | 0 |\n| 2025 | 2 | One issue with lift identified - which has been resolved | 0 |\nThe number of individuals in your local authority area who have been granted asylum status and subsequently presented as homeless\nAn asylum seeker who has a successful claim is usually granted either 'humanitarian protection' or 'refugee' status which provides eligibility for homelessness services and social housing. These applicants are usually described as being 'lawfully present'.\nPlease refer to the table below which shows the number of homelessness presentations in Perth and Kinross from this cohort broken down by financial year.\n| Financial Year | Homeless Presentations |\n|---|---|\n| 2019/2020 | 5 |\n| 2020/2021 | 5 |\n| 2021/2022 | 0 |\n| 2022/2023 | 5 |\n| 2023/2024 | 15 |\n| 2024/2025 | 35 |\nPlease find more information about asylum seekers in the Perth and Kinross Council area on the people seeking asylum page."

      "text": "'People are angry': Behind the wave of asylum hotel protests\n- Published\n\"We are not happy with these men in this hotel because we fear for our children,\" Orla Minihane tells me. \"If that makes me far-right then so be it.\"\nOrla has lived near Epping since she was a child and describes herself as a \"very boring woman who has worked in the City of London for 25 years\". Last year she joined Reform UK and hopes to stand as a local candidate for the party.\nOn a busy road leading to the Essex town, The Bell Hotel, now fortified, is one of more than 200 across the country where the government houses asylum seekers.\nIn the last month a series of protests, sometimes totalling several hundred people from both sides - and on one occasion up to 2,000 according to Essex Police - have taken place over the use of hotels for asylum seekers. About 20 more were planned for Friday and Saturday this week.\nThe latest round of demonstrations began at the 80-room Bell in July, after a man living in the hotel was arrested, and subsequently charged, with sexual assault, harassment and inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity. Hadush Kebatu, 41, from Ethiopia, has denied the offences and is in custody.\nThe case has sparked a wider conversation about the effect of housing asylum seekers in hotels in communities across Britain.\n\"Before there were women and children in the hotel - there was a little bit of crime, most people got on with it,\" Orla says. \"But now it's the fact that it's all men. It's not a balanced culture.\"\nThe protests have been promoted on social media under red, white and blue banner text with slogans such as \"Protect Our Community\", \"Safety of Women and Children Before Foreigners\" and \"All Patriots Welcome\".\nWe have identified far-right activists at some of the protests and activists who oppose them are watching what is happening closely.\nThe activist group Stand Up To Racism sees this as far-right organisations \"stirring up racist violence\" and trying to repeat the violence that flared after the murders of three young girls in Southport.\nHowever, the protests are often organised by people with little experience of street campaigning, including mothers with families and professional careers, like Orla. That they are getting involved suggests that in some communities, with hotels close by, there is a shift in the public mood about Britain's asylum hotels.\nOutside The Bell, which is surrounded by steel fencing and guarded by a 24/7 security team, one of its residents, Wael, from Libya, is a year into his asylum claim and waiting for his fourth Home Office interview.\n\"I spoke with one of the protesters,\" Wael says. \"Everything's good. Epping is nice. We can sit and stay. People respect us.\n\"I want to learn English and work. In a car wash or something. I will not stay here and take food. I have a dream - to make money and play football and have fun with my time. It's a small dream.\"\nWael is happy to talk, give his name and have his picture taken. But two other young Iraqi Kurds who are staying at The Bell, and allowed to freely come and go, are more cautious and less positive.\nThey tell me a gang of youths in masks and on motorbikes, has just shouted expletives at them. Shortly afterwards I catch sight of the bikers nearby.\nOne of the asylum seekers says that living in a hotel room 24 hours a day is messing with his mind. When I ask about their dealings with the Home Office they hurry inside The Bell.\nShortly afterwards a passing driver yells, \"Burn it down\".\nLast summer in the wake of the Southport murders, that is what some protesters tried to do at other hotels.\nThis summer, there have been isolated clashes, when activists on each side of the argument, anti-fascists and hard-right, have faced each other, or the police.\nOften the migrants have watched from the sidelines, penned up behind the fencing, or filming from upstairs windows.\nThe police have largely kept control, sometimes facing criticism for their methods, including the false claim that Essex Police used buses to transport pro-migrant activists to a protest in Epping. For now, arrest numbers are way below those in 2024.\nI ask Orla, who made an impassioned speech at a recent protest, why she is so aggrieved by the asylum hotel.\nShe says friends have described their daughters being \"grabbed\" by young, non-white men in the area. She has seen shoplifting, she says, in the local Marks & Spencer.\n\"Everyone knows they are asylum seekers,\" Orla says, \"Epping is very white.\"\nShe adds of the hotel's occupants: \"You know they are coming for freebies and when they come here they abuse the privilege. It's ridiculous.\"\nAsylum seekers would say they are seeking protection by coming to the UK, although some are ultimately judged not to be eligible for asylum status.\nLast month Stand Up To Racism claimed Orla had shared a stage with an alleged member of a neo-Nazi group at a hotel protest. She told BBC News she had \"no idea\" who he was, and he says he has since left the group.\nAsylum seekers are not normally allowed to work in the UK. Successive governments have judged that paying for their accommodation and food is preferable to allowing them to compete with British workers in the jobs market, offering an incentive to come here.\nIn June, the government warned some asylum seekers may be illicitly working as food delivery drivers.\nSixteen miles south of Epping, residents in Canary Wharf, east London, live in gleaming glass towers and traditional East End houses alongside another asylum hotel. It is a very different place but many locals share similar opinions.\nAsylum seekers recently arrived during the small hours at the wharf-side four-star Britannia International - 610 rooms, but, according to a former staff member, no longer the \"luxury hotel\" described in some reports. Rumours that they were coming triggered protests by local residents, many of them office workers in the Canary Wharf business district.\nOutside the hotel, Chengcheng Cul, who is Chinese, draws a distinction between his \"legal migration\" to the UK, and \"illegal asylum seekers\".\n\"If people can come over the Channel illegally, and easily, what encourages decent people to come legally, pay their tax, and get involved in this society? Is this setting a good example? This country has opened the border to illegal migrants.\"\nLorraine Cavanagh, who works for charities on the Isle of Dogs, echoes the concerns in Epping. \"I don't know who they are.\n\"They are unidentified men who can walk around and do what they want to do with no consequences,\" she says.\nThat comment, \"I don't know who they are\", lies at the heart of the opposition to asylum seekers in these communities.\nIt can be very hard to establish basic facts about the young men in the hotels, the system that put them there, or the impact they might have on locals.\nWhile growing in number, asylum seekers who come by small boats across the English Channel are a small proportion of total immigration to the UK, and in 2024, just over a third of all asylum seekers.\nThe government has contracted out the task of accommodating them to three companies: Serco, Clearsprings and Mears. They buy up rooms in houses and in hotels, usually taking them over completely.\nMinisters regularly talk about their ambition to \"smash the gangs\", but say less about the hotels. The government won't confirm where they are because of concerns they might be attacked.\nMadeleine Sumption from the Migration Observatory points out there is a problem publishing information about small groups of asylum seekers when it might identify them by age or sex, a long-standing approach for public bodies.\nWe know how many hotel places are being used in each region - the vast majority are in the south of England. They cost \u00a35.77m a day for the government to provide. The estimated cost over the decade to 2029 has spiralled from \u00a34.5bn in 2019 to \u00a315.3bn.\nBut there are no specific figures for the age and sex of hotel occupants, no details about their countries of origin, or their claim for sanctuary in the UK.\nSo when local communities allege crime rates go up when asylum hotels are opened, or raise fears about the hotels being full of only single adult males, it is often impossible to prove the point either way.\nThere were 35 sexual and violent offences reported in Epping town in May. In the same month, the year before, when there were no asylum seekers at The Bell, 28 sexual and violent offences were reported. In May 2023, the hotel was being used by the Home Office for migrant families. The number of reported offences was 32.\nBut how many of these offences involved asylum seekers? The police do not publish statistics about exactly where crimes happen or who is reported to have committed them.\nSo in many ways, we don't know \"who they are\".\nOrla believes more information would help reduce tension and is furious at the government's handling of the asylum system.\n\"If you conceal the truth and you act as if you are hiding something, people are going to be angry,\" she says. \"If they said there are 70 in the Bell Hotel, five are from Sudan, five from somewhere else, I think most people would feel better.\"\nEpping Forest District Council's Conservative Leader, Chris Whitbread recently said that \"it is important to be transparent\" about asylum hotel information.\nIn a recent report, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, David Bolt, criticised how the Home Office deals with asylum hotels. \"It is clear that the Home Office still has a long way to go to build trust and confidence in its willingness to be open and honest about its intentions and performance,\" he wrote.\nThe Home Office says it removed 6,000 people from hotels in early 2025 and has already closed 200 hotels. In its manifesto, Labour pledges to close them all by the next election.\nOn the other side of the political divide from the anti-migrant campaigners, in north London outside a meeting \"to organise against the right wing\", Sabby Dhalu from the protest group Stand Up To Racism wants the government to work more closely with councils so that their residents are better informed.\nThis should include \"explaining why these people are here, where they come from, what's happening in those countries,\" she says. \"That they're in the process of seeking asylum and going through the application process. Settling them in with the community.\"\n\"I think you've got far right organisations that are determined to repeat the events of last year,\" she added.\n\"And because for their own cynical reasons, they want to stir up racist violence, and in order to build their own political organisations.\"\nThat said, she feels that voices on the right are \"whipping up\" and weaponising a wider feeling of discontent among the public over Labour's cuts to public spending, and that the government is \"making silly concessions\" to the right in doing so.\nStopping the boats is a challenge which haunts the government, as it did the Conservatives. The Home Office has managed to cut the asylum claim backlog, currently standing at 79,000, but the claimants keep coming and the cost of accommodation is soaring. There is a feeling the government is struggling to cope and ignoring the views of communities.\nMany are in agreement that having more than 200 hotels, full of asylum seekers often waiting for lengthy periods for decisions on their applications, is not a sustainable situation.\nWhether or not the current protests continue, the government will have to find a solution.\nThis article has been updated to include more detail from Essex Police about the size of protests, with total numbers including both protesters and counter demonstrators."

  "argos_summary": "Hundreds of protesters gathered in Perth to oppose asylum seekers housed in hotels, while a counter\u2011demonstration welcomed refugees; police separated the groups and noted no safety incidents. Local councils and the Home Office defended the accommodation, citing no community safety issues and that hotels are temporary contingency housing. Similar protests have erupted across the UK, with some far\u2011right elements and extremist slogans, prompting counter\u2011protests by anti\u2011racism groups. FOI requests reveal two Perth hotels house 191 asylum seekers, but details are withheld to prevent disorder. The protests highlight tensions over asylum policy, misinformation, and the need for transparent communication.",
