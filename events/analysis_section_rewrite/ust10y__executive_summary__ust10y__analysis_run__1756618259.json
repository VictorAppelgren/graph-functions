      "feedback": "The draft is too verbose, mixes multiple assets, and lacks the concise, evidence‑anchored style required for a 4–6‑sentence PM brief. Tighten it to a single‑asset focus on **UST 10‑year (ust10y)**, keep each sentence a clear causal chain with an inline citation, and drop any non‑UST references (e.g., mortgage rates, dollar index). Replace generic “could” statements with explicit magnitude ranges (e.g., “cut → –10 bp”, “hawk → +10 bp”). Add a precise catalyst window (e.g., “September 25 Fed meeting, Aug 30 PCE”) and a watch‑list sentence that lists the exact dates and data points. Ensure every risk is tied to a specific trigger and its impact on ust10y (e.g., “inflation > 3 % → +50–100 bp”). Finally, re‑order the content to: 1) current level & range, 2) base‑case drivers & magnitude, 3) key catalysts & dates, 4) risks & their directional impact, 5) watch signals. This will produce a 5‑sentence, citation‑rich, decision‑useful brief that satisfies the acceptance gate.",
