  "title": "AI Misreads Black Women\u2019s Hairstyles\u2014And It Could Cost Them Jobs",
  "description": "Testing AI on different Black hairstyles revealed troubling bias in how professionalism and intelligence are judged. This article explores the workplace implications.",
  "content": "An August 2025 experiment highlights the disparities in how AI evaluates Black women\u2019s hairstyles. For the experiment, eight photos were generated by ChatGPT\u2019s image generator DALL-E. Four of the photos were of a Black woman in her late 30s wearing a white button-up shirt. The only variable that was manipulated was the Black woman\u2019s hairstyle and included four different hairstyles: straight shoulder-length hair, a big afro, a teeny-weeny afro (TWA), and braids. A second set of four photos of a white woman in her late 30s wearing the same white button-up shirt were generated, with her hairstyle being the only variable that was manipulated and included four different hairstyles: shoulder-length straight hair, a short pixie cut, a bob style, and long, curly hair. There was a total of eight photos that were put into three different AI systems to assess AI\u2019s perceptions of the individual.\n\nTwo of the three AI tools assessed, Clarifai and Amazon Rekognition\u2019s AI, produced similar results. Out of the four different Black woman\u2019s hairstyles that were analyzed, the braids were the only hairstyle that the two AI tools did not assign the characteristic of intelligence to. The braid hairstyle resulted in lower happiness ratings and more neutral emotional ratings compared to the straight hairstyle and the big afro hairstyle. What was also interesting was that with some of the Black women\u2019s hairstyles when comparing them to each other, the AI struggled to recognize them as the same person.\n\nThe third AI tool used, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, rated the braid hairstyle more positively and gave the TWA the highest intelligence rating compared to the three other Black woman\u2019s hairstyles. Across all three AI tools, the Black woman with straight hair received the highest professionalism ratings. When assessing AI\u2019s analysis of the white woman\u2019s hairstyles, across the three AI tools, none of the hairstyles were associated with intelligence-related penalties or negative social trait associations and the AI was able to recognize them as the same person, except when the long straight hairstyle was compared to the bob hairstyle\u2014the AI struggled to recognize these as the same person. For the white woman, the long curly hair received lower ratings from the AI than the other three hairstyles it was compared to. This experiment demonstrated that, in general, a white woman\u2019s hairstyle is less likely to affect how AI tools perceive her competence.\n\nThere are some important implications of this experiment. There is an increasing amount of workplaces that are now leaning on AI tools like facial recognition and facial analysis software to help them verify the identity of job candidates during the interview process, given the rise in fake candidates applying for remote jobs. When these tools are used, it\u2019s possible that for Black women who change their hairstyle, the AI systems may not be able to verify their identity, leading to an automatic rejection and preventing them from moving to the next stage of the interview process. For Black women who are part of workplaces that adopt facial recognition and facial analysis technology for access to workplace tools or even company buildings, this could cause them heightened scrutiny, denied entry, delays in verification and possibly being locked out of workplace systems.\n\nFor workplaces that use AI-powered video analysis tools to assess job candidates, it\u2019s possible that AI tools may flag Black women job candidates as less professional, and they may receive lower ratings and evaluations simply because of their hairstyle. Many Black women feel the pressure to conform, assimilate and change their hairstyle to adhere to Eurocentric standards of beauty and understandably so. Failing to adhere to dominant cultural norms could cost them a job.\n\nAI is just reflecting biases that are entrenched within society but there are several ways for each of us to push back. Education is imperative; everyone should understand hair discrimination and texturism, and how they manifest both within society and in the workplace. Individuals should also learn about the CROWN Act and ensure that workplace policies and practices (particularly grooming and appearance policies) are inclusive and equitable. During the hiring process, candidates should be evaluated based on objective criteria, rubrics and scorecards should be integrated into the hiring process, and if culture fit is included as a hiring metric, it should be clearly outlined and defined. Lastly, ensure that if you\u2019re utilizing AI to aid with hiring decisions, that AI doesn\u2019t have the final say and that there is human oversight at every step of the way.",

      "text": "Job-seeking impostors, including deepfakes, are exploiting the remote work trend, defrauding U.S. companies and potentially threatening U.S. national security, according to experts.\nApproximately 17% of hiring managers surveyed said they had encountered candidates using deepfake technology to alter their video interviews, according to career platform Resume Genius. It surveyed 1,000 hiring managers across the United States.\nBy 2028, 1 in 4 job candidates worldwide will be fake, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.\n\"Deepfake candidates are infiltrating the job market at a crazy, unprecedented rate,\" said Vijay Balasubramaniyan, CEO of voice authentication startup Pindrop Security, who said he recently caught a deepfake job candidate.\n\"It's very, very simple right now\" to create deepfakes for video interviews, Balasubramaniyan said. \"All you need is either a static image\" or video of another person and a few seconds of audio of their voice, he said.\n\"Remote jobs unlocked the possibility of tricking companies into hiring fake candidates,\" said Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of data security software company Vidoc Security Lab, who recently posted a viral video interaction with a deepfake job seeker on LinkedIn.\n\"If this trend continues and if we experience more and more fake candidates, then we definitely will need to develop some kind of tools to verify if the person is a real person, if they are who they claim to be,\" Moczadlo said.\nWhile fraudulent job seekers can originate from anywhere, fake candidates with ties to North Korea have drawn significant headlines in recent months.\nIn May 2024, the Justice Department alleged that more than 300 U.S. companies had unknowingly hired impostors tied to North Korea for remote IT roles, resulting in at least $6.8 million in overseas revenue. The workers allegedly used stolen American identities to apply for remote jobs and employed virtual networks and other techniques to conceal their true locations.\n\"When we hire candidates or fake candidates who are from sanctioned nations, it becomes a national security concern,\" said Aarti Samani, an expert in AI deepfake fraud prevention. \"The reason it becomes a national security concern is because, once these candidates or these individuals are in an organization, they are taking that salary and funding activities back in those nations. And those activities can be illicit as well. So inadvertently, we are funding illicit activities in sanctioned nations.\"\nAs AI technology rapidly evolves, fake AI-generated job candidate profiles are undermining the credibility of the hiring process.\n\"The whole reason you need to worry about deepfake job seekers is, at the very least, they're making the real employees, potential employees and candidates not able to get the job or [get the] job as easy,\" said Roger Grimes, a veteran computer security consultant. \"It can create all kinds of disruption, just making the hiring process longer and more expensive.\"\n\"Potentially, you could even be applying for a job and someone's not sure whether you're real or not, and you don't even get that call, and you don't know why you didn't get the call,\" Grimes said. \"It was all because perhaps they saw something that made them think that maybe you're a deepfake candidate, even when you weren't.\"\nWatch the video above to learn how fake candidates can harm businesses and what steps can be taken to combat this issue."

      "text": "Typically, when companies are on the search for talented candidates, one variable that is assessed is the job applicant\u2019s \u2018fit\u2019 with the organizational culture. Culture fit can be thought of as how congruent an individual\u2019s values are with the organization. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), hiring an employee that does not fit the company\u2019s culture can cost the company 50-60% of that individual\u2019s annual salary. There is little debate regarding the importance of culture fit, however improper procedures for assessing culture fit can lead to bias and discrimination. According to Patty McCord, who served as the chief talent officer at Netflix from 1998-2012, focusing on culture fit during the hiring process can lead to a lack of diversity because organizational leaders often feel like those who fit the culture best are individuals who are similar to them. This is an example of the similar-to-me bias, which suggests that individuals gravitate towards others who are like them. It is critical to hire employees that are congruent with the corporate culture, but because culture fit is such an ambiguous variable to assess, companies must come up with effective strategies to assess culture fit. What can organizations do to ensure that they are preventing homogeneity within the company? How can organizations accurately evaluate and assess the culture fit of job applicants, to avoid unconscious bias and discrimination?\n- It is important to establish clear and quantifiable indicators that can be used to measure culture fit. Culture fit cannot simply be a feeling. If a manager does not feel like a person is a good fit for the company, they should be able to justify why. To assess and evaluate the culture of your company, take a look at the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the organization. How does the organization gauge its performance and success? Evaluate how well-aligned a job applicant\u2019s background is with the KPIs of the organization. Does the applicant have what it takes to help the organization reach its strategic goals? Why or why not?\n- The evaluation of whether an employee fits the company should be made by a search committee or team, consisting of diverse individuals from varying backgrounds. One individual should not be the deciding factor regarding whether an employee fits the culture. If, however, the structure of the organization does not allow for multiple people to assess culture fit, there should be quantifiable measures used to assess perceived fit.\n- It may be beneficial to have current employees evaluate and assess the company culture and come up with definers of what the corporate culture actually consists of, rather than relying on one or two manager\u2019s definitions. This will create a more realistic and holistic definition of culture fit from individuals working directly in the positions that are being filled and also allows employees to develop a realistic understanding of the job.\n- Because of the subjective nature of culture fit, assessing factors such as individual personality traits could be one way to objectively measure culture fit. Tools such as the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP-NEO) can be used to assess the personality traits that have been associated with cultural fit dimensions. While it could be problematic to use a personality test as the sole indicator of culture fit, using a test to supplement additional information such as an in-person interview and performance indicators can be a great way to assess fit.\nWhen done correctly, the evaluation of an employee\u2019s culture fit can allow organizational goals to be met, can decrease turnover intentions and a slew of other positive outcomes. It is important that organizations focus on proper and objective techniques to assess culture fit to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization."

      "text": "There is a long history of Black hair being demonized, vilified, and politicized. Hair discrimination is a widespread issue that doesn\u2019t receive enough discussion. Afro-textured hair is victimized in workplaces and schools and because of this pervasive bias, legislation like the CROWN Act has been pushed forth to provide state-wide protections against hair discrimination. Texturism can be thought of as the discrimination faced by those with coarser and more Afro-textured hair. Texturism is based on the premise that hair textures closer to white are more acceptable. Our conversations about hair discrimination require more nuance and must unpack the texturism that is faced by those with coarser hair textures.\nIn a 2021 Byrdie article, Star Donaldson examined the history and evolution of the hair typing system. Donaldson explains that hair typing was a system used to understand an individual\u2019s \u201cproximity to whiteness based on their [hair] texture.\u201d The original hair type categorization system was developed in the early 1900s by Eugen Fischer, a Nazi German scientist and ardent eugenicist. Fischer used this system in present-day Namibia on the mixed-race population to try and determine \u201cBlackness\u201d based on hair texture. Between 1904-1907, Namibia was the site of a mass genocide where German military forces killed approximately 80,000 of the indigenous Namibian people. This genocide was based on white racial supremacy beliefs. Systems such as the hair typing model developed by Fischer contributed to the subjugation of the Namibian people. Fast forward to today, and Oprah Winfrey\u2019s celebrity hairstylist Andre Walker is generally thought of as the person who established and popularized the hair typing system that is currently in use. Based on Walker\u2019s method, hair type can be divided into distinct categories based on the texture: 1 is straight hair, 2 is wavy hair, 3 is looser curls, and 4 is considered the coarsest and most tightly curled hair type. Walker\u2019s system also associates letters with these numbers to further segment the hair types. Based on the hair typing system, 4c hair is considered to be the kinkiest and most tightly coiled hair texture and by design, the hair texture that experiences the most discrimination.\nThe first iteration of the natural hair movement emerged in the 1960s. Black activists were embracing their natural hair and afros were being celebrated as a symbol of power and resistance. A re-emergence of the natural hair movement occurred in the 2000s. During this time, Black hair was being promoted on social media websites like YouTube and there was a rise in natural hair blogs. Around this time, there was a move away from the use of chemical straighteners like relaxers due to the wealth of research indicating how harmful these chemical straighteners were. With the popularity of the natural hair movement, there was a swift move to monetize and monopolize on a booming industry. A 2020 Essence article indicates that the Black hair care industry generates an estimated $2.51 billion with that number likely to grow as time goes on. Even within a movement that was designed to be inclusive, hierarchies were formed. It should come as no surprise that a system initially designed to ascertain white proximity is being wielded as a tool of anti-blackness.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nIndividuals with 4c hair experience prejudice in a multitude of ways. In 2009, Chris Rock explored the importance of hair within the Black community in his documentary Good Hair. What must receive an equal amount of attention and discussion is the ways that texturism manifests in present day. From journalists making derogatory remarks about the then-7-year-old daughter of Beyonce and Jay-Z, to a TikTok influencer named Lipglossssssssss being bullied for wearing her natural hair without manipulation, and the backlash over a young Black girl\u2019s hair in an H&M ad, texturism is alive and well. Those with 4c hair are often charged more at hair salons because this hair type is deemed as being more \u201cdifficult\u201d to deal with. When analyzing the natural hair community, 4c hair representation is lacking. 4c hair does not receive the same amount of recognition or appreciation as other hair types and many natural hair bloggers and YouTubers like Mayowa\u2019s World, Jouelzy and nappyheadedjojoba have spoken about this throughout the years.\nCreating a world where the most marginalized communities are liberated requires us to examine each and every system and structure to understand the insidious ways that hierarchies have naturally formed and continue to oppress certain segments of the community. We must make consistent and concerted efforts to disrupt and dismantle these hierarchies. We must center the voices and the experiences of those most harmed within the natural hair community. We may want to think about doing away with, abolishing, and re-imagining the hair typing system, which was originally designed to perpetuate anti-blackness. Why continue to use a redesigned version of a tool initially developed by a known eugenicist to segregate and separate? We must analyze the ways that we perpetuate texturism within our families and communities. Do we encourage the narrative that straight hair, long hair, and looser curls on girls, women and femmes are more acceptable and more beautiful? We must unlearn that. Refusing to adhere to social norms is important. Pushing back against our natural inclination to associate femininity with long and straight hair is one of many ways that we resist white supremacist norms. We must encourage and amplify more platforms designed to center 4c hair. Supporting those that speak out about texturism and who are most harmed by hair discrimination is vital and educating others about this type of discrimination is imperative."

      "text": "When striving to create a workplace that is equitable and justice-oriented, it\u2019s important to examine unique forms of oppression that different communities face to develop interventions that address workplace harm. One pervasive issue that doesn\u2019t receive enough attention is hair discrimination and the specific ways that this type of bias manifests in the workplace. The bias that is faced when it comes to Afro-textured hair and Afrocentric/Black hairstyles is a product of an anti-black system. The term \u201cBlack hair\u201d in this article will be used to refer to both Afro-textured hair and Afrocentric/Black hairstyles. This article seeks to explore four ways that hair bias shows up in the workplace and provides suggestions for creating a more equitable workplace for all.\n1. Discriminatory policies. Many workplaces have specific policies about professionalism and appearance expectations that can cause disparate impact, or unintentional discrimination, for Black employees. Grooming policies that include vague requirements about \u201cprofessional\u201d hairstyles must be updated to specifically outline what hairstyles are acceptable (and why). It\u2019s important to keep in mind that leadership and customer preference is not a valid justification for prohibiting Black hair. If you have an employment policy that restricts a hairstyle like braids, for example, is there a valid reason why braids would prevent an employee from successfully completing their job duties? Have an equity consultant evaluate employment policies and practices periodically to ensure that they are not unintentionally discriminating against a population of your workforce.\n2. Hiring bias. Black hair can trigger an individual\u2019s unconscious bias and make a job candidate less desirable to employers. Unsurprisingly, Black women with Black hairstyles received negative ratings when applying for jobs, according to a 2020 research study. Throughout the decades, there have been a plethora of cases where job candidates were denied employment because of Black hairstyles, including the recent cases of Jeffrey Thornton and Chastity Jones. Employers must ensure that hiring practices are objective and anti-racist, and that tools like rubrics or scorecards are utilized during the hiring process. There is still a gap in understanding when it comes to Black hair discrimination\u2014hiring professionals should also receive education about Black hair discrimination and the ways it can manifest in the workplace.\n3. Microaggressions. In addition to discriminatory policies and the unconscious bias that creeps into the hiring process, Black employees also experience microaggressions related to their hair. Before the pandemic, Black employees experienced being asked by non-Black employees if their hair could be touched. Even in a remote workplace setting, these racial microaggressions continue. Black employees may be asked questions about a new hairstyle they are rocking or interrogated about whether their hair is real. It is not often considered how these sorts of questions can make a person feel othered and dehumanized\u2014these inquiries are rarely asked to non-Black colleagues. Microaggressions workshops must be provided and should include an exploration of Black-hair-related microaggressions and how they impact employees on the receiving end.\n4. Inequitable treatment. A hairstyle deemed \u201ctoo Black\u201d can not only thwart a person\u2019s likelihood to be hired, but the discrimination continues once an employee is hired into a workplace. Black employees who change from a more \u201cprofessional\u201d (read: white/Eurocentric) hairstyle to a Black hairstyle find that they can experience inequitable treatment from both leadership and peers. In addition to hiring biases, some employees have been fired for their Black hair. There are several cases which further illustrate this including the stories of Brittany Noble Jones and Imani Jackson. It\u2019s easy to hide one\u2019s discrimination behind the guise of poor performance. Performance evaluation processes should be as impartial as possible. Similar to the tools utilized during hiring interviews to make the process more equitable, performance evaluations should include objective practices like calibration and employee scorecards. If Black hair somehow violates workplace policies, there should be a bona fide occupational reason that the policy is in place. It is important that employers are educated about legislation like the CROWN Act, which provides state-wide protections against race-based hair discrimination."

      "text": "I Tested AI on Different Black Hairstyles. The Results Surprised Me.\nWhen a hairstyle changes, so can an algorithm\u2019s opinion of your intelligence.\nWhy I Did this Experiment\nRecently, I was writing an article about racist AI hiring systems and while researching, I stumbled upon this German research study from 2021. The study was examining the use of artificial intelligence to evaluate videos of job applicants\u2014it was really interesting especially to be a study from 2021 (before ChatGPT really blew up in the mainstream). I really appreciated the different variables they tested in the study. They changed a job candidate\u2019s video backgrounds and added eyeglasses and head coverings to candidates to see if any of those variables influenced the AI\u2019s evaluation of the job candidate (spoiler alert: it did).\nBack when I was writing my dissertation, the first GPT model didn\u2019t exist yet. If it did, I would have been able to carry out so many cool and interactive research studies. Initially, when I met with my dissertation advisor, I told him I wanted to do a study on LinkedIn profile pictures to see if changing the race, gender, and religious headwear of job applicants made a difference in perceptions of hire-ability, warmth and competence. Back then, in the early 2010s, it was harder to manipulate photos without paying fees that felt exorbitant as a broke Ph.D. student living in New York, so I scrapped my initial idea and focused my dissertation research on something different.\nWhen I read through that German study, it brought me back to my dissertation research and what I had wanted to study initially. I was so giddy thinking about all the research studies I could carry out on my own using the free AI tools that are now available to the public. It made me curious about whether manipulating variables in a job candidate\u2019s photo would impact an AI tool\u2019s evaluation of the candidate\u2019s emotions and professionalism ratings.\nWhen I was a full-time assistant professor, I had the backing of my institution, and I was able to receive funding for research and studies like this would have been encouraged by my university. I realize now that I don\u2019t need the backing of any large institution to carry out research that is interesting to me, so I decided to do my own experiment\u2014putting to good use the endless research methodology courses I took in grad school.\nMethodology\nImage Generation:\nI had ChatGPT\u2019s image generator (Dall-E) create a set of images for me. Using these prompts, it created the following images:\nPrompt: Can you create me an image of a medium brown skinned Black woman in her late 30s with a white shirt on sitting in front of a gray wall with a plant in the background? Can you give her long black hair?\nI then gave it this prompt: can you change her shirt to a white button up shirt with a collar?\nThis was the image it generated for me:\nThe next prompt: perfect! thank you! now can you change her hairstyle to a big afro\nThis was the image it generated for me:\nThe next prompt: can you change her hairstyle to long black braids?\nThis was the image it generated for me:\nThe next prompt: could you change her hairstyle to a very short afro?\nThis was the image it generated for me:\nThe next prompt: Can you create me an image of a white woman in her late 30s with a white shirt on sitting in front of a gray wall with a plant in the background? Can you give her long blonde hair? Please make the background similar\nThis was the image it generated for me:\nThe next prompt: can you change her hairstyle to a short blonde pixie cut\nThis was the image it generated for me:\nThe next prompt: can you give her blonde long curly hair\nThis was the image it generated for me:\nThe next prompt: can you make the white woman's hair a blonde bob but keep everything else the same?\nThis was the image it generated for me:\nSo, I had four images of a Black woman with different hairstyles and four images of a white woman with different hairstyles. For each woman, the only variable that was manipulated by the image generator was her hairstyle. [It would have been a lot of fun to manipulate multiple variables like hairstyle and color to see if that made a difference.]\nAI Tools Used:\nThe AI tools I used were Clarifai, Amazon Rekognition, and Claude by Anthropic.\nIn Clarifai, the tools I used were two general-image-recognition tools and their face-sentiment-recognition tool. In Amazon Rekognition, I used their facial analysis tool and their face comparison tools. In Claude, here were the prompts:\n(In relation to the 4 images of the Black woman)\nPrompt 1: Which looks most professional?\nPrompt 2: Which images look most intelligent?\nThen I asked Claude about my \u201cfriend\u201d Karen. In relation to the 4 images of the white woman:\nPrompt 1: What about my friend Karen? Which of her photos looks more professional?\nPrompt 2: Which image does she look most intelligent?\nFindings\nHere is a summary of some of the most important findings:\nBlack Women\u2019s Hairstyles Key Findings: Clarifai & Amazon\n\u00b7 Across the four hairstyles I assessed (straight hair, big afro, short afro/teeny weeny afro (TWA), and braids, the braids were the only hairstyle where the AI did not assign tags related to intelligence\n\u00b7 Out of the four hairstyles, the braid hairstyle resulted in lower happiness ratings from the AI and more neutral emotional ratings in comparison to the straight hair and big afro\n\u00b7 Contrary to what I expected with the big afro hairstyle, the AI assigned more neutral or positive tags to the big afro hairstyle compared to the the braids hairstyle\n\u00b7 When comparing the big afro hairstyle with the short afro/TWA hairstyle, the AI system struggled to recognize these as the same person \u2013 providing a 0% similarity rating\nBlack Women\u2019s Hairstyles Key Findings: Claude\n\u00b7 Claude rated the braid hairstyle positively\n\u00b7 Unsurprisingly, the straight hair consistently received the highest professionalism ratings across all three AI tools\n\u00b7 The TWA received the highest intelligence rating\nWhite Women\u2019s Hairstyles Key Findings: Clarifai & Amazon\n[Note: It was important to compare Black women\u2019s hairstyles but to truly analyze differences, it was necessary to have images to compare it to, to analyze AI\u2019s perceptions of Black women\u2019s hairstyle against its perceptions of white women\u2019s hairstyles.]\n\u00b7 Across all 4 hairstyles, white women\u2019s emotions were consistently assessed by the AI as neutral or surprised rather than showing strong negative emotions\n\u00b7 None of the 4 hairstyles were associated with intelligence-related penalties or negative social trait associations in the same way that the Black woman\u2019s braid hairstyle was\n\u00b7 When comparing the blonde pixie cut with the 3 other hairstyles, the AI was able to recognize them all as the same person\n\u00b7 When comparing the long straight blonde hair with the 3 other hairstyles, the AI was able to recognize them all as the same person\n\u00b7 The only anomaly was that the AI struggled to identify the long straight blonde hair and the blonde bob as the same person \u2013 providing a 0% similarity rating\nWhite Women\u2019s Hairstyles Key Findings: Claude\n\u00b7 Claude rated the blonde pixie cut and the blonde bob the highest in professionalism and intelligence and rated the blonde curly hair lower for structure but still associated the style with positive traits like \u201cwarmth\u201d and \u201ccreativity\u201d.\n\u00b7 The curly hair was rated lower because the hairstyle was perceived as less structured\nResearch Implications:\nAs an organizational psychologist, workplace equity advocate and Black woman, I found the results of this experiment super fascinating. Broken down in simple terms, here are some of the research implications.\n\u00b7 Facial recognition and analysis software may struggle to identify Black women when there is a hairstyle change. If you are traveling to a country that utilizes AI-powered tools to assess passport photos, it may flag you if your hair doesn\u2019t match your photo, which could lead to additional questioning, delays or even missed travel.\n\u00b7 For Black women, if you change your hairstyle, you could experience issues with your smartphone Face ID. This means if you\u2019re trying to use banking apps, for example, or any application that requires a password, this could cause delays and additional issues\n\u00b7 Law enforcement uses facial recognition technology despite the many flaws with it, especially on darker skin tones (shout out to Dr. Joy Buolamwini for her important research in this area). This technology already struggles to identify individuals who are more melanated. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s also been a lot of research on the combined impact of hairstyle and skin tone and whether both variables could produce a compounding effect. Hairstyle changes could lead to misidentification by law enforcement, which could prove dangerous.\n\u00b7 For places that use facial recognition technology for entry, Black women may be at a greater disadvantage than their counterparts, and this could lead to more misidentifications.\n\u00b7 For white women, they are less likely to have hairstyles impact how AI tools perceive their competence, there is less pressure to conform their hairstyle due to societal norms, and they are less likely to experience false negatives when it comes to their identity verification\nWorkplace Applications:\n\u00b7 It was hard to find exact data on the amount of AI hiring tools that utilize AI image analysis technology but if these tools get adopted, at scale, in the workplace, hairstyles like braids may be unintentionally penalized, impacting Black women\u2019s intelligence ratings.\n\u00b7 There are, however, fields that currently use image analysis and facial recognition technology to ensure a job candidate is who they say they are. When I looked into which companies are currently providing AI-assisted identity authentication during the hiring process, three companies came up: Glide AI ID Verify, Honeit Candidate Identity Verification and Authentication, and CLEAR & Greenhouse. If these tools are being used in the hiring process, hairstyle changes for Black women could be the difference between an automatic rejection and moving on to the next stage of the interview process.\n\u00b7 Hairstyle changes may mean Black women risk being locked out of workplace systems and buildings\n\u00b7 If a job candidate\u2019s video is being rated and evaluated by AI, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that these findings could extend beyond just images to also impact videos. The question to consider is whether these results will be replicated with job candidate videos. Will the AI rate Black women with certain hairstyles as less intelligent or misread their emotional state when assessing a video?\n\u00b7 Professionalism is still seen through the lens of white culture. Black women who adhere to these white-centered norms (straightened hair) are perceived as more intelligent and professional. White women with curly hair may also be penalized under white-centered norms of professionalism\no Black women may continue to feel pressured to conform to white beauty norms\no When evaluating who deserves to be hired and who should advance in our workplaces, the AI is reflecting real-life biases of race-based hair discrimination. Black women who don\u2019t adhere to white dominant beauty norms may be penalized in the workplace in many ways.\nWhat Can We Do?\n1. As a job candidate, if you find out that AI-powered tools are being used at some point during the hiring process, inquire about the tool and what is being done to ensure bias is mitigated.\n2. If ethical AI is important to you, investigate advocacy groups you can join. Some great ones include Algorithmic Justice League and Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n3. Push for legislation that protects job seekers against unethical AI. Learn more about the type of legislation has been implemented in New York City, Colorado, and Illinois.\n4. Discuss hair discrimination and share resources in your workplace (including my article on how it impacts Black women in the workplace) and encourage the adoption of the CROWN Act in your state.\n5. It was important for me to write about this experiment to let other people know that this is an issue. Knowledge is power and equipping ourselves with this information is a crucial step to addressing this issue. Conduct your own experiments and share the results far and wide. Also be sure to share this article with others so that more people understand the ways that hair bias in AI systems manifests."

  "argos_summary": "An August 2025 experiment revealed significant biases in AI evaluations of Black women's hairstyles compared to white women's hairstyles. The study found that AI tools often associated Black women's braids with lower intelligence and professionalism ratings, while white women's hairstyles did not incur similar penalties. This disparity raises concerns about the implications for Black women in hiring processes, as AI systems may misidentify them or unfairly assess their competence based on hairstyle changes, potentially leading to discrimination in job opportunities.",
