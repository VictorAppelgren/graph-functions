  "title": "How Jet Engine Output Is Measured (No, It's Not By Horsepower)",
  "description": "Jet engine output is measured in thrust, not horsepower. Thrust reflects the force moving an aircraft forward, making it the standard metric for jet power.",
  "content": "With their capability to fly higher, farther, and more efficiently, jet engines have transformed air travel since their introduction. From its origins in the 1930s, the jet engine was a substantial technological leap forward compared to the propeller-driven engines that had been in existence for 30 years. Propeller engines have several limitations, including slower speed, limited ceiling height, and restricted cargo capacity. However, due to their power, jet engines can surpass these limitations by harnessing expanding hot gases to provide propulsion. Because jet engines do not use pistons and crankshafts, their output is measured in thrust, or engine pressure ratio.\n\nThrust is a jet engine's output, created by converting the fuel's stored chemical energy to mechanical energy. This process powers the engine's fan blades, which move the aircraft through the air. To measure the amount of thrust from a jet engine, a specific formula, written as thrust = mass flow rate (exit velocity \u2013 inlet velocity), is used that is based on physics principles of mass and force. Testing engine thrust requires placing it in a test cell, a purpose-built facility, where it is suspended from the ceiling using specialized equipment. The engine is then connected to various instruments that monitor its different systems, including electrical, hydraulic, and fuel.\n\nIt is important to note that different variables can affect jet engine efficiency. Altitude is an important factor, as air is less dense in the upper stretches of the atmosphere, which causes a reduced amount of air to go to the engine, lowering its output. Next, airspeed also directly impacts thrust, because while it initially increases proportionate to the speed, there is a point during supersonic speeds, around Mach 3, at which the thrust begins to diminish due to the reduced heat the engine can supply its burner.",
