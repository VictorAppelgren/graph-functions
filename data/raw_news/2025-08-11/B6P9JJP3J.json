  "title": "Aryna Sabalenka extends revealing tiebreak record to beat Emma Raducanu at Cincinnati Open",
  "description": "Sabalenka's staggering tiebreak record illustrates her play under pressure, but also her vulnerability in matches this year.",
  "content": "Aryna Sabalenka won a 15th and then 16th straight tiebreak Monday to edge her way past Emma Raducanu in three hours and 10 minutes, securing a place in the Cincinnati Open fourth round. Her lethality in tiebreaks speaks to an ability to deliver in the tightest moments; that she so frequently has to play them \u2014 19 in 2025 \u2014 underlines the vulnerability that has underscored her performances this year.\n\nThis latest victory, by a tight 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(5) margin against an inspired opponent, was in keeping with Sabalenka\u2019s year so far. She looked on the verge of several sizeable upsets, before finding a way to eke out the win. Against Raducanu, Sabalenka looked close to physical exhaustion in the afternoon Cincinnati heat that was comfortably over 86 degrees (30 degrees celsius). She roused herself for the final stages, finishing the match with an ace on a day that Arthur Rinderknech of France retired against Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada due to the impact of the heat and humidity in Ohio.\n\n\u201cAt the end I went for crazy shots,\u201d Sabalenka said in her on-court interview, acknowledging that her rally tolerance had diminished as rapidly as her energy reserves. She ended up with 72 unforced errors to Raducanu\u2019s 41, and also won three points fewer than her opponent. But the strategy of going for broke ultimately paid off, with her more frequent forays to the net largely successful. She\u2019s added doubles specialist Max Mirnyi to her coaching team for Cincinnati and the U.S. Open, and the way in which she started putting volleys away in the closing stages spoke to a focus on that area of her game. The knifed backhand volley to bring up two match points in the tiebreak was particularly gutsy.\n\n\u201cI think that it was a little bit risky from me and it really helped to put a lot of pressure on her,\u201d Sabalenka said of that point.\n\nIn her previous answer she had said again how good it is to have Raducanu back as a factor on the WTA Tour, and the pair shared a warm embrace at the net at the end of the match. Sabalenka said pre-match that Raducanu is \u201cdefinitely gonna be back in the top 10 very soon\u201d, and much of this encounter showed why she was so bullish.\n\nRaducanu took advantage of Sabalenka\u2019s limited movement in the oppressive combination of heat and humidity with some brutal returning and hitting from the baseline. While she has had an encouraging summer, she has tended to struggle when up against the very best \u2014 this was a 14th loss from 18 career matches against top-10 opponents \u2014 but taking this match to the wire will mean what she called a \u201cfact-finding mission\u201d beforehand will have provided plenty to chew on. Especially in the wake of her close defeat to Sabalenka at Wimbledon, in which she also lost the first set in a tiebreak, but on that occasion lost in straight sets, rather than three.\n\nThe near-25-minute game Raducanu won towards the end of the decider, in which she fended off four break points that would have left Sabalenka serving for the match, underlined how dogged a performance this was from the Brit.\n\nShe is No. 34 in the live rankings, which if she can cling onto by the end of the tournament would be enough for a U.S. Open seeding, with two would-be seeds, Zheng Qinwen and Paula Badosa, ruled out of New York with injury.\n\nDespite losing the opener here, Raducanu, the U.S. Open champion four years ago, took the match to Sabalenka, whose second-serve percentage plunged to 47 percent in the second set as the energy drained from her.\n\nSabalenka\u2019s subdued body language was in stark contrast to the fizzing energy of Raducanu\u2019s new coach Francis Roig. This is the first tournament Roig, a longtime former coach of Rafael Nadal, has been in Raducanu\u2019s box, and he was vocal throughout \u2014 so much so that Raducanu was given a ticking off in the first set when Roig left his seat to walk towards her and offer instructions at a change of ends.\n\nEarly in the second set, Roig told Raducanu that \u201cwin this set and you\u2019ll win the match.\u201d When Raducanu did level things, he said ahead of the decider: \u201cYou\u2019re better than her.\u201d\n\nAfter Raducanu hit an ace out wide to take the second set, it felt as though the match was hers for the taking. Sabalenka was moving slowly between points, and she was often a step slow from the baseline. And while Roig was not ultimately proved right, Raducanu\u2019s serving was much improved after what has been a trying year for her in that element of her game.\n\nSabalenka by contrast was clinging onto her service games in the decider, and getting nowhere on her opponent\u2019s. But she forced her first break point since the opening set with Raducanu serving down 3-4, which the Brit saved with an ace down the T. She saved another three when Sabalenka made errors, digging out the hold of serve at the end of a 13-deuce epic in which her concentration was tested by a child in the stands frequently crying as she went to serve.\n\nRaducanu was also two points from defeat on a couple of occasions when serving down 4-5, but again was able to get enough balls into play to draw mistakes from her opponent. It took a tiebreak, where Sabalenka has been unbeatable since losing one exactly six months ago to Ekaterina Alexandrova at the Qatar Open, for the world No. 1 to finally prevail.\n\nSabalenka will next face J\u00e9ssica Bouzas Maneiro in the Cincinnati fourth round on Wednesday, after the Spaniard beat Taylor Townsend of the U.S. in straight sets. Bouzas Maneiro lost to Sabalenka 6-3, 7-5 in the second round of this year\u2019s Australian Open, but broke the world No.1s serve three times and generated 11 break points in all.\n\nSabalenka is the fourth-best player in the world at holding serve on the WTA Tour in 2025, behind Elena Rybakina, Naomi Osaka, and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. But of the 19 sets she has played in the 2025 season that have gone to tiebreaks, just two \u2014 one against Raducanu in Cincinnati, and one against McCartney Kessler at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif. \u2014 have gone to 6-6 with no breaks of serve. She has played seven finals, winning three and losing four, two of the defeats coming in Grand Slams.\n\nAnd so on to Wednesday \u2014 Sabalenka said after beating Raducanu that without a day off, she\u2019d be too exhausted to play again \u2014 when the tennis world may get another tiebreak, and another illustration of the duality of Sabalenka in 2025.",

Raducanu, the world No. 33, has been without a permanent coach since Nick Cavaday stepped down in January.\nAdvertisement\nShe has worked with Mark Petchey, the commentator and former coach of Andy Murray, on an informal basis, but has been seeking a formal coach with Petchey\u2019s broadcast commitments prohibitive to a full-time partnership.\nRaducanu has enjoyed an upswing in form during their work together, reaching the quarterfinals of Queen\u2019s, the Wimbledon warmup in London, and the semifinals of the Citi Open in Washington D.C.\nRoig worked alongside Nadal\u2019s principal coaches \u2014 the player\u2019s uncle, Toni, Marc Lopez and Carlos Moya \u2014 for all 22 of his Grand Slam titles. He left the team in 2022, going on to coach Italy\u2019s Matteo Berrettini between 2023 and 2024.\nRaducanu and Roig are expected to practice together Aug. 5 ahead of the WTA 1,000 event, one rung below a Grand Slam.\n(Photo: Minas Pagiotakis / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Aryna Sabalenka, the world No. 1, has added Max Mirnyi to her coaching team for the remainder of the North American hard-court swing.\nMirnyi \u2014 a 10-time doubles Grand Slam champion and fellow Belarusian \u2014 joins as a consultant, supporting long-standing head coach Anton Dubrov, performance coach Jason Stacy and the rest of the team, which remains unchanged.\nAdvertisement\nSabalenka is clear at the top of the WTA rankings, leading world No. 2 Coco Gauff by almost 5,000 points, but she has not won a Grand Slam title since last year\u2019s United States Open. She lost to Madison Keys and Gauff respectively in this year\u2019s Australian and French Open finals, before losing to Amanda Anisimova in the semifinals at Wimbledon.\nSabalenka has known Mirnyi, 48, for many years and he had been on court with her during her most recent training block in an informal capacity. At the end of it, she asked if he would join as a consultant for the Cincinnati Open and the U.S. Open; she is defending champion at both events. Mirnyi, a huge server and excellent volleyer, reached the No. 1 ranking in doubles and No. 18 in singles before retiring in 2018. He won ten Grand Slam doubles titles overall. Five years after retiring, he underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour.\nA representative for Sabalenka did not specify the areas on which Mirnyi will focus.\nSabalenka will be the favorite to retain her title at the U.S Open, where the singles draw begins on August 24, and is the player to beat in Ohio too. But despite winning three titles this year, she has also lost four finals, and has looked tense in difficult moments. At Roland Garros, Sabalenka produced an error-strewn performance and Gauff took advantage.\nSabalenka skipped the Canadian Open, saying in a media roundtable in Ohio this week that she had been feeling \u201cexhausted\u201d since the French Open and didn\u2019t want to risk injury by overplaying \u2014 as happened last year when she was forced to miss Wimbledon because of a shoulder problem.\nHer Cincinnati Open begins this weekend with a second-round match against former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.\n(Photo: Matthew Stockman / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Welcome back to the Monday Tennis Briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories from the past week on court.\nThis week, the tennis battle for prestige heated up in Cincinnati, the Canadian Open brought progress and familiar problems for a star of the sport and a rising American won a title in fitting circumstances.\nIf you\u2019d like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here.\nAn eternal struggle arrives in Ohio\nAs the tennis calendar cycles through its four Grand Slams, the Australian Open, French Open and U.S. Open and Wimbledon engage in a quiet but fierce contest for the unofficial title of the best tournament of them all. They increase prize money. They improve player facilities. They move qualifying on-site to deliver longer events, more ticket sales and more revenue (except for Wimbledon, which is bidding to expand and join the three-week party the others have).\nAdvertisement\nThe Grand Slam arms race isn\u2019t the only elbow-sharpening that goes on at the top of tennis. Indian Wells, Calif., is the home of the BNP Paribas Open, which has long held the unofficial but coveted title of the \u201cfifth Slam,\u201d at least since it moved to its current location, the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, in 2000. The Miami Open, which immediately follows Indian Wells in the calendar, was held in similar regard before, but some of its luster has faded.\nThis week\u2019s Cincinnati Open, the first edition following a $260million (\u00a3193m) renovation of the Lindner Family Tennis Center in Mason, a short drive from the Ohio city that gives the event its name, is causing a stir among some of the players. Speaking on court with doubles partner and 2024 Wimbledon champion Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, Jelena Ostapenko said: \u201cI almost feel like it\u2019s the fifth Grand Slam. Those changes in one year? This is something unbelievable.\u201d\nWhat used to be a bunch of parking spaces and walkways has become a clubhouse (56,000 square feet); an outdoor pavilion (16,000 square feet); an indoor tennis center with six courts (53,000 square feet), and an operations center (20,000 square feet).\nThere are 13 new courts, including a new 2,300-seat sunken stadium. The site has doubled in size from 20 to 40 acres.\nBut does it have a case? Indian Wells has prize money going for it in two senses: it pays more, and does so more equally. The Cincinnati Open women\u2019s singles champion will this year receive $752,275; the men\u2019s title winner will get $1,124,380. At Indian Wells back in March, Mirra Andreeva took home $1,127,500 while Jack Draper received $1,201,125, with the difference in total prize money accounted for by ATP Tour player contributions.\nMore than 500,000 fans attended in California, around 100 miles east of Los Angeles and near the affluent desert resort of Palm Springs, with the U.S. Open warm-up event in the Midwestern state of Ohio expected to attract around 300,000 this year.\nAdvertisement\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s long-desired 1,000-level event looked ready to be a tacit bid to dethrone Indian Wells, but that soon-to-be-announced tournament is now expected to be a significant contraction from its ambitions to host a combined event of two 96-player draws.\nThis year, Italian Tennis Federation (FIT) president Angelo Binaghi expressed a desire to turn May\u2019s Italian Open into a \u201cfifth Slam\u201d by expanding to three weeks, which would have entailed acquiring the license for the Madrid Open, which precedes it in the calendar. That remains a desire, and a distant one.\nProgressive competition between the 1,000-level events is a boon for the ATP and WTA Tours as the power games between them and the four Grand Slams rumble on, but for now, if a \u201cfifth Slam\u201d does exist, Indian Wells looks safe in its self-appointed slot.\nJames Hansen\nProgress for Naomi Osaka in Canada?\nWith every positive tournament Naomi Osaka has, the progress she makes is at the mercy of how she loses.\nLast week\u2019s run to the Canadian Open final was a step in the right direction for the four-time Grand Slam champion, but as the title slipped away against 18-year-old Victoria Mboko, Osaka entered an all-too familiar maelstrom.\nHaving won the opening set and lost the second, Osaka fought back tears in the third as the match started to get away from her. Mboko saved four break points to move ahead 3-1, a lead she would never relinquish. In the closing stages, including the final game, Osaka appeared to even give up on points. Her on-court interview afterwards lasted about 20 seconds and included no mention of her opponent.\nOsaka later explained in a social media post that she \u201cwas in a daze\u201d during those on-court speeches, focusing on not repeating past speeches that she felt had not gone well. In quotes provided through the WTA Tour, she said: \u201cThis morning, I was very grateful. I don\u2019t know why my emotions flipped so quickly, but I\u2019m really happy to have played the final.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cVictoria played really well. I completely forgot to congratulate her on the court. She did really amazing.\u201d\nOsaka\u2019s run there in Montreal lifted her ranking 24 places to No. 25, meaning she will be seeded at the biggest events for the first time since returning to the sport at the start of last year, after giving birth to her first child. She also won the kind of tight match en route to the final that she has been losing more than winning since that comeback, saving two match points to beat Russia\u2019s Liudmila Samsonova in the second round.\nThat tournament was also Osaka\u2019s first with new coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, and the positive results bode well for the next few months.\nShe should go into the U.S. Open in two weeks\u2019 time with renewed confidence in her tennis, even if doubts will linger as long as collapses like the one in the final continue to happen.\nCharlie Eccleshare\nHow Ben Shelton\u2019s Canadian Open win fits his season\nCarlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner weren\u2019t involved in the Canadian Open, so it was fitting that Ben Shelton came away with the title after running into a Sinner-and-Alcaraz-shaped wall at all three Grand Slams this year.\nThe American is now No. 4 in the ATP Tour \u201cRace to Turin,\u201d which counts ranking points won in 2025, despite only recording two top-10 wins all year. Both of those came last week in Toronto, during Shelton\u2019s run to his first ATP Masters 1,000 title, one rung below a Grand Slam.\nHe beat world No. 8 Alex de Minaur in the quarterfinals and then compatriot and world No. 4 Taylor Fritz in the next round. Before that, Shelton had lost all five of his top-10 matches in the year, three of which came at the majors against the two runaway stars in men\u2019s tennis. He lost to Sinner at the Australian Open and Wimbledon and to Alcaraz at the French Open. His record against top-10 players since the 2023 U.S. Open, where he reached the semifinals, is 3-10.\nAdvertisement\nShelton edged out Karen Khachanov in the final in Toronto, coming from a set down and winning a third-set tiebreak. He played his best tennis in the big moments, which has become a calling card for his career \u2014 except when up against the best of the best. So while the trophy is a milestone for Shelton in many ways, it also doesn\u2019t offer much insight into how he is going to get over the biggest hurdle in the sport for pretty much everybody in the top 10.\nClimbing up to best-of-the-rest status at age 22 is not a bad place to be, and he has reached a career-high ranking of No. 6 on the back of gradual improvements to his rally tolerance and performance in return games.\nBut Sinner and Alcaraz, who both returned to action at the Cincinnati Open over the weekend, cast a long shadow over the rest of the tour.\nShelton knows that to win more 1,000-level titles, and certainly Grand Slams, he\u2019ll have to raise his game again to overcome the two players who have handled him with relative ease at the majors so far this year.\nCharlie Eccleshare\n\ud83c\udfc6 The winners of the week\n\ud83c\udfbe ATP:\n\ud83c\udfc6 Ben Shelton (4) def.
