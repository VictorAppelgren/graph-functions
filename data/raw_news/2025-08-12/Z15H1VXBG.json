  "content": "Tottenham Hotspur are close to finalising a new deal for full-back Djed Spence.\n\nThe 25-year-old was one of the breakout stars of last season under Ange Postecoglou, and has been rewarded for his progress with a new improved contract at Spurs.\n\nSpence still had almost three years left on his current deal, which was last extended in October 2024. Talks have moved fast this month to secure his long-term future at the club.\n\nThe full-back struggled to make in impact in his first few years at Spurs, and was written off as a \u201cclub signing\u201d by then-head coach Antonio Conte in summer 2022 almost as soon as he arrived from Nottingham Forest.\n\nThree loan spells followed, at Rennes, Leeds United and Genoa, with questions about his attitude and application.\n\nBut Spence was trusted by Postecoglou last season and started his first ever game for Spurs in December 2024. He quickly showed why he was such a highly-rated player, starting 19 games in all competitions.\n\nPostecoglou used Spence at both left- and right-back, and he looked equally comfortable on either side. And given Spence\u2019s excellent 2024-25 season, it was inevitable that Tottenham would open talks about improving his terms to secure his stay at the club.\n\nAfter leaving Fulham\u2019s academy, Spence joined Championship club Middlesbrough in 2018, making his debut in August of that year, shortly after his 18th birthday.\n\nSpence made 70 appearances for the club before joining Nottingham Forest on loan for the 2021-22 season, becoming a key part of the team that earned promotion to the Premier League for the first time in more than 20 years.",

      "text": "Djed Spence was standing in a tight corridor, surrounded by a group of journalists following Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s 2-0 victory at Brentford earlier this month. The 24-year-old was clutching the player of the match award in his left hand following an assured performance on what was only his seventh Premier League start.\nAdvertisement\nThe right-footed full-back started on the left and nullified Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford forward has been among the league\u2019s most dangerous players this season, scoring 14 goals \u2014 only Chris Wood, Alexander Isak (both 17), Erling Haaland (19) and Mohamed Salah (22) have better records.\nWhen The Athletic asked Spence how he is so comfortable attacking and defending on both flanks, he shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI just believe in my abilities and I\u2019m a confident player. Whether I\u2019m playing off the left or right, I just try to do my best.\u201d\nSpence\u2019s laid-back demeanour is at odds with his exceptional talent. He snaps into challenges on opposition forwards before gracefully gliding past their own tackles.\n\u201c(Djed) was excellent again today,\u201d team-mate Ben Davies said in that same corridor. \u201cHe was up against an in-form winger (Mbeumo) and was so solid defensively. He\u2019s so physical and quick. Sometimes you take it for granted the space he leaves behind but he gets back for it. He makes sure when he\u2019s on the pitch he plays to his strengths and doesn\u2019t have to try and do too much.\u201d\nTottenham manager Ange Postecoglou went a step further by describing him as \u201coutstanding\u201d and praising how he \u201cloves the challenge of taking on the elite wingers in the Premier League\u201d.\nAll of this underlines why it was so bizarre that Spence had to wait for 881 days after joining Spurs from Middlesbrough in July 2022 to make his first start for them. He set up James Maddison within the opening minute of that 5-0 victory over Southampton on December 15. Since then, he has become an integral part of Postecoglou\u2019s plans and has started 11 of the last 14 games he has been eligible for.\nWhen left-back Destiny Udogie returns from his hamstring injury, Spence will have a strong case to start stay in the team either on the left of defence ahead of the Italian, or in place of Pedro Porro on the right. It is a scenario which would have been unthinkable this time a year ago when Spence was on loan with Italian side Genoa following an unsuccessful six-month spell with Leeds United.\nThis is how Spence resurrected his career with Spurs.\nIt is impossible to talk about Spence\u2019s time at Spurs without mentioning Antonio Conte.\nSpence thrived on loan under Steve Cooper at Nottingham Forest during the 2021-22 season after falling out with Middlesbrough\u2019s then head coach Neil Warnock. He started 38 games in the Championship for Forest, as well as all three of their play-off matches as they secured promotion. Spurs snapped up Spence but within a couple of weeks Conte made his feelings about the move clear.\n\u201cSpence is an investment of the club,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club wanted to do it. I said, \u2018OK, this player is young but he showed he can become a good, important player for us\u2019. The club decided to buy him.\u201d\nBeing labelled a \u2018club signing\u2019 was not an ideal start for Spence and he only made six appearances under Conte during the first half of the 2022-23 campaign, all of them as a substitute, before joining French side Rennes on loan in January 2023.\nIn an interview with The Athletic last March, Spence reflected on his difficult debut season. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a great time,\u201d he said. \u201cI went there and I didn\u2019t play, so obviously it was hard for me. When you sign somewhere as a player for a big club, you want to be filled with confidence and welcomed with open arms, as I was, but it just didn\u2019t feel right when I went there. Things didn\u2019t go as well as I planned.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t get a chance, there\u2019s not much you can do as a player. You get lost, you\u2019re not playing, it\u2019s hard to get a rhythm again. It\u2019s never easy going to a new environment when things don\u2019t go well but it\u2019s part of the game. It\u2019s a learning experience.\u201d\nSpence returned to Spurs in the summer of 2023 and there was a new head coach in charge. Postecoglou was transforming the squad and he let Spence move to Leeds on loan.\nThe defender endured a difficult time at Elland Road. He missed nearly three months of action after damaging his knee ligaments in training while head coach Daniel Farke became frustrated with his time-keeping. The loan was cancelled early and Spence joined Genoa in January 2024 as part of the deal which brought Radu Dragusin to Spurs. He made 16 appearances in Serie A, predominantly at right wing-back in a 3-5-2 system, as Genoa finished 11th.\nSources close to Spence, who asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships, have described him as an introvert. He is loud and demanding on the pitch but can be quiet in the dressing room. The defender is aloof and sometimes this has been misinterpreted as him not caring.\nSpence benefitted from his six-month spell in Italy. It was the second time in his career that he moved to a different country and was forced to come out of his shell to interact with team-mates and coaches. He played at the San Siro twice, including completing 90 minutes in a 3-3 draw with Milan, and impressed in a goalless draw at Juventus. After having his confidence knocked by Leeds, it was a reminder of his quality and what could be achieved if he stayed focused.\nGenoa had the option to sign Spence permanently for \u00a38.5m but he returned to Spurs in the summer. The defender\u2019s future was uncertain but he was determined to earn another chance in north London.\nSpence made a surprise appearance in a pre-season friendly against Hearts and assisted Will Lankshear in a 5-1 victory. The defender was playing out of necessity though as several key first-team players, including Udogie, Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero, were either still on international duty or enjoying extended holidays. The first genuine sign that Spence might stay with Spurs came when they visited Japan and South Korea in July. He was included in the travelling party while other fringe players, including Sergio Reguilon and Bryan Gil, were left behind to try to facilitate transfers.\nAdvertisement\nSpence featured in all three of their games on tour and Postecoglou said he had \u201creally impressed\u201d all of the coaching staff. \u201cI think he\u2019s been very, very good for us this pre-season, in terms of the way he\u2019s trained and his general attitude,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity for him here, for sure. Thinking about building a squad, he would definitely be somebody who could (contribute) with the attributes he has.\n\u201cA lot of these things are in the players\u2019 hands themselves. They decide their own future in many respects and I think Djed\u2019s in that boat. Maybe he\u2019s learned a couple of things over the last couple of years about himself and hopefully we can sort of bear the fruit of that. He\u2019s a very good player who fits into our football and so it\u2019s as much about him as it is about me making a decision.\u201d\nThe amount of disruption Spence has faced in his short career should not be ignored. This is the first time since the 2020-21 campaign that he will spend the entire season at the same team. Bouncing around clubs, working under different coaches and with a rotating cast of team-mates would impact any player\u2019s development.\nSpence thrived under Cooper at Forest because he knew how to interact with and cajole young players due to his experience of working with England\u2019s youth-team groups and in Liverpool\u2019s academy. He has a great relationship with Udogie as they both share similar tastes in music and fashion. They attended a concert together by the Nigerian artist Asake at the O2 Arena last year while Spence forged a strong bond with Brennan Johnson when they previously played together at Forest. Spence is surrounded by familiar faces at Spurs who understand his quirks.\nSpence featured off the bench in Tottenham\u2019s opening two league games and everything seemed to be heading in the right direction until he was left out of their Europa League squad. Last week, he was included in their squad for the knockout stages of the competition.\nA week after suffering that blow, Spence saved Spurs from an embarrassing exit in the third round of the Carabao Cup. The former England Under-21 international was a half-time substitute and he went on a marauding run in the 88th minute before poking the ball over Coventry City\u2019s goalkeeper Ben Wilson to equalise. Johnson scored the winner a few minutes later. Spence played the entire second half of September\u2019s 3-0 victory over Manchester United and was rewarded with a new contract until 2028.\n\u201cWith Djed, it could have been easy for him to go out on loan again,\u201d Postecoglou said after the deal was announced. \u201cBut when he came into pre-season, he was determined to make a career for himself here at Tottenham rather than wait to be loaned out. He did everything right in training, his attitude was great. He\u2019s a good footballer, I think the way we play suits him and he\u2019s knuckled down to that. And he\u2019s earned himself a spot on the roster in our squad. The rest is up to him again. Because it\u2019s an easy decision for me to make when I see that. Like I said, sometimes footballers think their fate is in other peoples\u2019 hands. For the most part, it\u2019s in their own.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHowever, that turned out to be his last appearance for two-and-a-half months apart from a brief cameo against Manchester City which only lasted a couple of minutes. Spence picked up a groin injury in training and was stuck on the bench when he returned. In December, Postecoglou threw doubt over Spence\u2019s chances of regular playing time.\n\u201cI think a major turnaround is Djed playing regularly at this level, just because he has hung around doesn\u2019t mean that is a major turnaround,\u201d he said. \u201cI still think a lot of that is Djed continuing to train hard and wait for his opportunity.\u201d\nThat opportunity came within a couple of weeks and he has not looked back. Spence has been excellent going forward, he registered an assist in the 4-3 victory over Manchester United in December, and shackled Salah superbly in Tottenham\u2019s 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg.\nSpence is no longer an outcast, patiently waiting for a genuine opportunity to impress. The table below shows that he has been Tottenham\u2019s standout full-back this season across a number of metrics. Spence offers Postecoglou something different to Udogie and Porro which is reflected by the number of take-ons he attempts (4.7) per 90. Spence likes to drive with the ball into central areas and draw defenders towards him before sliding the ball into the space they have vacated. Spence\u2019s assist for Maddison against Southampton is the perfect example of this. Porro\u2019s biggest strength is the quality of his crossing and set-piece delivery while Udogie excels at underlapping Son Heung-min on the left wing.\nIn the sequence below, Spence has the confidence to drive in between Mikkel Damsgaard and Christian Norgaard before charging into a huge pocket of space in front of Brentford\u2019s defence. Spence passes the ball to Dejan Kulusevski and then makes a selfless run which drags Keane Lewis-Potter out of position. A tiny gap opened up for Kulusevski to shoot through and Richarlison just missed it at the back post.\nSpence is intelligent and skilful as this no-look pass around Kevin Schade in the same game shows. When Schade tackles Richarlison in the box, Spence wins the ball back within six seconds.\nIf there is one main criticism of Spence it would be that he is too elaborate in possession at times. In last month\u2019s north London derby, he tried to squeeze past two Arsenal players on the edge of his own box when the smarter option would have been to pass to Archie Gray. Unsurprisingly, Spence lost the ball and Gabriel Martinelli found Jurrien Timber who whipped a cross into the box.\nSpence rarely touches the ball with his left foot and prefers to pass or cross with the outside of his right boot. In the scenario above, he actually awkwardly spins onto his right foot. This over reliance makes him predictable and he needs to be aware of other teams identifying this weakness.\nBoth of Spence\u2019s parents are from Jamaica and he regularly travels there on holiday. They hail from Saint Mary\u2019s parish, located on the north-east coast of the Caribbean island. Some of the scenes from the first James Bond film, Dr No, were filmed on Saint Mary\u2019s idyllic beaches.\nSpence grew up in south London with his two sisters, Bria and Karla-Simone who appeared as the titular role in the television series the Confessions of Frannie Langton and in the 2019 film Blue Story. He is eligible to represent England and made multiple appearances for the Under-21s.\nMany of Spence\u2019s peers from that group, including Emile Smith Rowe, Anthony Gordon, Morgan Gibbs-White and Cole Palmer, have been capped at senior level. Smith Rowe and Spence played for the same team, Junior Elite, when they were kids.\n\u26bd\ufe0f | THROWBACK Thursday. Junior Elite Graduates & Greats \u2013 Chris Kelly, Emile Smith-Rowe, Di\u2019shon Bernard, Kieran Djiali, Wesley McDonald, Rowan Liburd, Djed Spence, Louie Watson & Bobby Mills. Truly iconic!#WeAreElite @TandridgeYFL @KentYouthLeague #ThrowbackThursday pic.twitter.com/qvpWtEQWJz\n\u2014 Junior Elite FC (@JuniorEliteFC) January 14, 2021\nSpence admitted after Tottenham beat Brentford that playing for England is \u201cdefinitely one of my goals I want to achieve\u201d. If he continues to impress for Spurs, then surely Thomas Tuchel will consider calling him up. It would represent the latest remarkable turnaround in Spence\u2019s career.\nAdditional reporting: Conor O\u2019Neill\n(Top photo: James Gill/Getty Images)"
