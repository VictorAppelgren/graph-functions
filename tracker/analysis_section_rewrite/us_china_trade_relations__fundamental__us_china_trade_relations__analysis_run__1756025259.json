      "feedback": "Strong potential for world-class caliber with a structured multi-year view, but the current draft would be sharper if it (a) fixes a clear, first-principles regime map and invariant anchors (e.g., real-rate differentials, terms of trade from tariff dynamics, productivity/growth from AI, balance-of-payments/stability of external position, and policy-reaction functions), (b) explicitly links policy shocks to a testable causal chain that ends in market pricing signals across assets, (c) builds a coherent base-case plus regime transitions, and (d) tightens the use of numbers from sources rather than descriptive summaries. Specifically: reframe as a three-regime tree: Regime A = episodic truces with tangible near-term relief (90-day tariff truce, 30% baseline tariffs, Nvidia revenue-sharing around 15%), Regime B = tighter tech/rare-earth leverage and export-controls risk that constrains supply chains and capex, Regime C = AI-driven productivity gains underpinning longer-run growth even under policy frictions (cite: OATKNJQ0E; AMHSWFZZI; NOTMRPS8C for regime triggers and numbers). Then spell out the causal chain: tariff/news cycles affect inflation pass-through and input costs, shaping capex/maintenance and corporate margins (cite CPI/framing in NOTMRPS8C; OATKNJQ0E); those feed into equity, credit, and FX pricing via expected policy paths (cite Norges Bank commentary in AMHSWFZZI). Quantify more aggressively: embed explicit reference points in the base case (e.g., 90-day truce duration; 15% revenue-share concession; 30%/10% tariff baselines; Nvidia/Apple/OpenAI dynamics; AI-driven productivity uplift of the order of 50% cited by Norges Bank’s Nicolai Tangén in AMHSWFZZI) and show what that implies for policy easing probability and equity risk premia. Reconcile conflicts by noting the spectrum of numbers (e.g., China’s submarine counts and fleet makeup from 40M82JY72; U.S. vs China carrier/submarine posture from the same piece and Defense/industry reporting in NOTMRPS8C) and tying them to strategic risk (e.g., AUKUS, replacement schedules, and forward basing). Strengthen catalysts/invalidation: a) a failure to extend or convert the 90-day truce (trigger for risk-off) vs a concrete Phase One-like deal; b) Nvidia/China license carve-outs or tightening (trigger for tech and supply chain repricing); c) a sustained CPI/ inflation stickiness that anchors a non‑easing regime; d) a shift in AI investments (credible productivity gains) that shifts the growth regime independent of trade policy (cite AMHSWFZZI for productivity numbers and OATKNJQ0E/NOTMRPS8C for policy signals); e) Apple/Intel/Nvidia regulatory moves and China responses (cite A86BJO636, OATKNJQ0E). For style and format, attach precise IDs after every factual claim, ensure coverage of all critical sources (40M82JY72 for naval/tech context; OATKNJQ0E, NOTMRPS8C, AMHSWFZZI for trade/policy; A86BJO636 for tech ecosystem; NOTMRPS8C for CPI/ Fed tone; AMHSWFZZI for Norges Bank AI/productivity), and explicitly acknowledge any conflicting data points (e.g., subs counts or future carrier plans) to avoid glossing over trade-offs. Finally, deliver a sharper base-case with a succinct watch-list: CPI print and Fed/Barkin-Schwab commentary; Stockholm talks and Nvidia/China licensing signals; long-run AI productivity indicators; and the 90-day tariff window’s progression toward a durable framework, with confidence flagged as moderate and contingent on policy credibility and supply-chain resilience (cite: OATKNJQ0E; AMHSWFZZI; NOTMRPS8C; 40M82JY72; A86BJO636).",
