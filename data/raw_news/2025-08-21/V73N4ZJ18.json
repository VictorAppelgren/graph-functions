  "description": "Tesco, Sainsbury's, John Lewis, Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl, Ikea, Boots, JD Sports, Currys and Kingfisher are among those to have signed a letter to the Chancellor.",
  "content": "The bosses of Britain's biggest supermarkets and high street chains are warning Rachel Reeves not to hike taxes on businesses again in her upcoming Budget.\n\nThey suggested they would not be able to 'absorb' a further increase in costs, which could see prices rise for consumers and deliver a fresh hit to Brits' living standards.\n\nTesco, Sainsbury's, John Lewis, Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl, Ikea, Boots, JD Sports, Currys and Kingfisher are among those to have signed a letter to the Chancellor.\n\nThey pointed to how Government policies had already 'added \u00a37billion in new costs to retail businesses'.\n\nThis included Ms Reeves' hike to employers' National Insurance contributions, an increase in the minimum wage, and the introduction of a new packaging tax.\n\nThe retailers, who are part of the British Retail Consortium, warned that further tax rises for businesses would leave Labour at risk of breaching its manifesto pledges.\n\nPrior to last year's general election, Sir Keir Starmer's party pledged to boost economic growth and families' living standards.\n\nOfficial figures published yesterday showed the headline rate of inflation rose by more than expected last month to 3.8 per cent.\n\nThis was the highest level since January 2024, while food and drink inflation rose to 4.9 per cent in July from 4.5 per cent in June.\n\nMs Reeves admitted there was 'more to do to ease the cost of living' following the figures.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium said Labour policies had 'driven up the costs of employment' and were 'fuelling price rises at the till'.\n\nIn their letter to the Chancellor, which was due to be delivered to the Treasury today, the retailers said they had 'done everything we can to shield our customers from the worst inflationary pressures'\n\n'But as they persist, it is becoming more and more challenging for us to absorb the cost pressures we face,' it added.\n\n'This year Government policy has added \u00a37 billion in new costs to retail businesses, resulting from changes to employer national insurance, higher employment costs, and the introduction of a new packaging tax.\n\n'Similar increased costs are also starting to flow through our supply chains.\n\n'Food prices - which had begun to ease - are once again climbing. The British Retail Consortium expects food inflation to hit 6 per cent later this year, driving up household bills just as winter energy costs start to kick in.\n\n'The impact is further being felt by communities as retail investment falls and 100,000 retail jobs have been lost over the last year alone.\n\n'Labour's manifesto made a clear and welcome promise to deliver good jobs and higher living standards but if future policy decisions lead to rising prices and fewer jobs, then those commitments are at risk.\n\n'Instead, the retail industry is uniquely placed to help deliver the Government's central economic mission given our presence in almost every community across the UK.'\n\nThe letter continued: 'As the chief executives of many of Britain's leading brands, we are determined to help deliver your growth ambitions.\n\n'However, for this to be possible, the conditions for stable prices, continued investment and sustainable employment must be at the heart of this year's Budget.'\n\nThe retail bosses also warned a planned overhaul of business rates should not increase the burden on shops.\n\n'No store should pay more as a consequence, with all shops excluded from the new higher multiplier,' the letter said.\n\nHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: 'Retailers have gone to extraordinary lengths to shield customers from rising costs, but Government policy is making that harder by the day.\n\n'The Chancellor must ensure a significant reduction to retail's rates burden and that no shop pays more at the upcoming autumn Budget.'\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: 'We are a pro-business Government - 380,000 jobs have been created since the start of this parliament and business confidence is at a ten-year high, according to a recent Lloyds Bank survey.\n\n'Since the election, we have struck three major trade deals with the EU, US and India, business rates are being reformed and corporation tax is capped at 25 per cent.'",

The haul - the highest ever for July - was boosted by Rachel Reeves' employer national insurance raid. However, that policy is also blamed for making it harder for firms to hire and pushing up unemployment. Ms Reeves' tax hike saw national insurance bring in an extra \u00a32.6 billion last month compared to last year and \u00a39.5 billion extra for the financial year to date. It helped the government bring July's borrowing - the gap between tax revenues and spending - to a lower than expected \u00a31.1 billion....read\nHUGO DUNCAN: The genie has burst out of the bottle - and it's all too clear who is to blame\n21/08/25 00:21Official figures last week showed that 206,000 jobs have been lost since the election.STEPHEN GLOVER: Even our family homes are not sacrosanct for this desperate, foolish Government.
