  "content": "/NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES/\n\nVANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 12, 2025 /CNW/ - Applied Graphite Technologies Corporation (\"AGT\"), AGT announces that it has completed the final tranche of a non-brokered private placement offering (the \"Offering\") of a total of 11,150,001 common shares (\"Common Shares\") at a price of Cdn$0.06 per share for gross proceeds of approximately Cdn$669,000.\n\nExisting insiders of AGT participated in the Offering. Participation by insiders of AGT in the Offering constituted a related-party transaction as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). The issuance of securities is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 on the basis that the fair market value of the insiders' participation in the Offering, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101, did not exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization. Finders' fees of 180,000 Common Shares, and $4,320 were paid to Canaccord Genuity Corp., and 15,000 Common Shares were paid to Haywood Securities Inc.\n\n3,611,667 Common Shares issued today are subject to a four-month hold period under applicable securities laws in Canada, which expires on December 13, 2025.\n\nThe net proceeds of the Offering will be used by AGT for project development and general working capital purposes.\n\nThis press release is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities in the\n\nUnited States or in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to qualification or registration under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. The securities being offered have not been, nor will they be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and such securities may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from U.S. registration requirements and applicable U.S. state securities laws.\n\nApplied Graphite Technologies is developing the Queens Mine Complex in Sri Lanka. The QMC is on private land in the heart of the vein graphite district, with historical workings and vein graphite outcrops. Vein graphite is naturally high grade (+95% carbon content in the ground) and does not require primary processing. Testing of vein graphite in lithium-ion battery anodes has shown very high capacities, performing better than synthetic graphite. Natural vein graphite has a far superior ESG footprint than synthetic and is cheaper without compromising performance.\n\nThe technical information in this news release has been prepared by Don Baxter, P.Eng., a \"qualified person\" as defined in National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\").\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking information as such term is defined in applicable securities laws, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management's current expectations and assumptions. The forward-looking information includes statements about Applied Graphite Technologies (AGT)'s plans and the completion of any remaining tranches of the Offering and AGT's actual use of proceeds from the Offering. Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current beliefs and are based on assumptions made by and information currently available to AGT, including the assumption that approvals will be obtained. Investors are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results to differ materially from those expected. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking information include, among other things, the receipt of TSXV final approval of the Offering. AGT cautions the reader that the above list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Except as required under applicable securities legislation, AGT undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking information.",
