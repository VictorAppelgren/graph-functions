  "description": "Texas House Democrats plan to return to the state after fleeing to block GOP redistricting efforts, local Texas media has confirmed.",
  "content": "Texas House Democrats have reportedly confirmed they intend to return to their state after fleeing in an attempt to halt legislative proceedings, which included GOP attempts to redraw congressional districts in the state.\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to ABC 13 Houston on Tuesday that the absent House Democrats will return to the Lone Star State after feeling like they accomplished their mission of killing the special legislative session called by Republicans to pass redistricting legislation. The special session expires next Tuesday.\n\nThe outlet reported the exact time of the Democrats' return to the capital in Austin is not clear.\n\nTEXAS GOP SEEKS TO \u2018DOMESTICATE\u2019 ROGUE DEMS FOR BREAKING QUORUM THROUGH NATIONWIDE CIVIL ARREST WARRANTS\n\nNews of the lawmakers' imminent return to the state comes on the same day that Texas Senate Republicans were able to get the new congressional maps approved. They must now be passed in the House before Republican Gov. Greg Abbott can sign them into law.\n\nEarlier this week, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows indicated they would adjourn the special legislative session this Friday if Democrats had not returned by then.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbott has signaled plans to immediately call a second consecutive special session and has teased that he may also add additional agenda items.\n\nThe strategy by Texas Democrats to leave the state and abdicate their duties in an effort to stall Republican legislative efforts is a strategy they have used before.\n\nIn 2021, more than 50 Texas Democrats left the state for the nation's capital in an effort to stall Republican election security legislation following President Donald Trump's 2020 election loss.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe effort led to Abbott ultimately calling three consecutive special legislative sessions, with the election security bill passing during the second one in August.",

      "text": "Texas Republicans, Attorney General Ken Paxton and House Speaker Dustin Burrows are seeking nationwide civil arrest warrants for the Texas House Democrats who broke quorum when they fled the state for Illinois and California.\nIn the latest escalation of the redistricting debate taking national politics by storm, Paxton and Burrows are seeking to \"domesticate\" civil arrest warrants in Illinois and California for the Texas Democrats who fled the Lone Star State to block a Republican-led redistricting plan that could protect Republicans' slim U.S. House majority.\n\"We are pursuing every legal remedy at our disposal to hold these rogue legislators accountable,\" Paxton said in a statement. \"Texas deserves representatives who do their jobs instead of running away at the behest of their billionaire handlers. If there\u2019s one thing Texans can\u2019t stand more than losers, it\u2019s cowards.\"\nBurrows emphasized that \"all options are on the table\" to ensure House members return home to Texas to \"fulfill their constitutional obligations.\"\nTEXAS ASKS ILLINOIS COURT TO ENFORCE ARREST WARRANTS FOR DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS\n\"The State has no choice but to pursue additional legal remedies to compel their return from other states. Our full focus is on stopping this dereliction of duty and restoring quorum in the Texas House as soon as possible so we may return our time, attention and resources where they most matter\u2014on the critical issues of the special session call,\" the Republican House Speaker said.\nABBOTT, PAXTON LAUNCH LEGAL BLITZ ON FLEEING DEMOCRATS IN REDISTRICTING SHOWDOWN\nBurrows issued arrest warrants on Aug. 4 for the Democrats who fled Texas, under Article III, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution and Rule 5, Section 8, of the Rules of the Texas House of Representatives.\nAccording to the attorney general's office, it allows for \"[a]ll absentees for whom no sufficient excuse is made may, by order of a majority of those present, be sent for and arrested, wherever they may be found.\"\nMore than a week later, as Democrats have yet to return, Paxton and Burrows are seeking to implement their warrants in Illinois and California, through the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\nWhile the Texas Republicans argue that other states are obligated to adhere to official acts by the state of Texas, both Govs. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Gavin Newsom of California have come out in support of the rogue Texas Democrats, as their home states float their own redistricting plans to balance the scales if Texas Republicans are successful.\nThe Democrats will not be detained and escorted back to Texas unless a state court in Illinois and California accepts Texas' civil arrest warrants.\nOnce lawmakers leave the state, they are beyond the legal jurisdiction of Texas authorities who can compel their return, according to GovFacts, a nonpartisan educational resource that explains U.S. government legalities.\nHowever, if they were to return to Texas, the Texas Constitution would allow legislative leaders to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members through civil arrest warrants, allowing law enforcement to find the missing Democrats and return them to the Capitol.\nPaxton has also filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court, requesting that 13 House Democrats' seats are declared vacant because they fled the state to avoid the Trump-backed redistricting vote.\nThe conservative attorney general also filed a lawsuit against former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, for allegedly conspiring to aid and abet Democrats' effort to break the quorum.\nAccording to the Courthouse News Service, Republican Tarrant County Judge Megan Fay issued a temporary restraining order against O'Rourke and his Super PAC, Powered by People, hours after the suit was filed \"to stop using funds to pay for Democrats' travel expenses and conduct fundraising to pay for such expenses in the future.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhen reached for comment, a Pritzker spokesperson pointed to his past comments, addressing the threat of nationwide civil arrests, in which he said Illinois law enforcement will protect \"everybody\" in Illinois.\nAnd a Newsom spokesperson flagged his X posts, trolling the Texas Republicans and urging them to \"come and take\" democracy.\nO'Rourke did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."

      "text": "Texas House Democrats departed the state Sunday in an attempt to halt a redistricting Monday vote, claiming that the legislation is \"using an intentionally racist map\" to undermine the voices of Black and Latino voters in the state of Texas.\nDemocrats\u2019 absence means that Republicans are unable to go ahead with a scheduled vote under House rules, blocking the potential passage of redistricting legislation that would establish a new congressional map that could lead to five new GOP U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\"This is not a decision we make lightly, but it is one we make with absolute moral clarity,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement Sunday.\nTEXAS DEMOCRATS FLEE STATE TO BLOCK TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING VOTE IN DRAMATIC LEGISLATIVE MOVE\nMost of the House Democrats fled to Chicago, while others headed to New York and Boston.\nThe Texas House stipulates that at least 100 members of the 150-member chamber must be present to conduct business, and roughly 50 Democrats are absent \u2014 meaning the vote is stalled until they return. It's unclear how Democrats plan to proceed, and Wu told reporters that precise plans were still up in the air.\nThe redistricting legislation would shift Democrat voters from toss-up districts into ones that are more solidly Republican, and also move other Republican voters into districts that lean more toward Democrats \u2014 ultimately paving the way for more GOP seats.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Democrats have fled the state in protest of legislation.\nIn July 2021, more than 50 Democrats also left the state of Texas and headed to Washington, D.C., to tie up Texas legislation that would implement new voting restrictions in the aftermath of President Donald Trump\u2019s loss of the 2020 election, which some Republicans claimed was \"stolen.\"\nSpecifically, the measure Democrats opposed included new voter ID restrictions for those voting by mail and prohibited drive-by voting and extended voting hours.
