      "summary": "The S&P 500’s top ten stocks now account for 40% of the index, an all‑time high, raising concerns that a weak earnings cycle in tech could trigger a sharp market pullback.  Morningstar’s Dominic Pappalardo warns that the concentration of tech names amplifies downside risk, especially as the labor market shows weak growth and the Fed may cut rates in September.  Sticky inflation, tariff‑driven price pressures, and the possibility of sustained high rates add further headwinds, prompting a recommendation to diversify into international, small‑cap, and healthcare equities.",
