  "description": "A strong revision to Q2 GDP ahead of the open seems to have put investors in a good mood today, even as a stronger economy takes away some odds that the Fed will be cutting interest rates.",
  "content": "Thursday, August 28, 2025\n\n\n\nMarket indexes notched two new record closing highs this day: the blue-chip Dow grew +71 points, +0.16%, to 45,636, and the S&P 500 stepped past 6500 for the first time ever, +20 points, +0.32%. The Nasdaq came up a hair shy of a new closing high, +115 points, +0.53%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained +5, +0.22%.\n\n\n\nA strong revision to Q2 GDP ahead of the open seems to have put investors in a good mood today, even as a stronger economy takes away some odds that the Fed will be cutting interest rates in the near-term. Weekly Jobless Claims remained remarkably steady, cooling concerns about an unraveling labor market.\n\n\n\nEarlier today, Pending Homes Sales from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) came in negative for July: -0.4%, falling from the +0.3% analysts were expecting and the -0.8% reported for the month of June. Month-over-month numbers were lowest in the Midwest (-4.0%), but also ticked lower in the Northeast (-0.6%) and the South (-0.1%). Only the West region saw a nice bump (+3.7%).\n\n\n\nWith perceived Fed funds rate cuts on the table for September and beyond, now +16% of NAR members expect an increase in homebuying traffic over the next three months. Seller traffic is expected to rise +21%, up from +17% from the same period a year ago.\n\n\n\nAutodesk ADSK shares are up +11% on its Q2 report after the close today, where earnings of $2.62 per share zoomed past the $2.44 in the Zacks consensus on revenues of $1.76 billion, which improved over the $1.73 billion expected. Guidance was also raised for both earnings and sales for the ongoing quarter, underlying strength for the varied software maker.\n\n\n\nDell DELL shares are flat at this hour following its Q2 results this afternoon, with earnings of $2.32 per share beating estimates by a penny on better-than-expected revenues in the quarter of $29.8 billion. There was some perceived weakness in the company\u2019s important PC space, even as AI demand was \u201cexceptional.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarvell MRVL results met Q2 estimates on both top and bottom lines after the bell \u2014 earnings of 67 cents per share and revenues of $2.01 billion \u2014 but lowered revenue guidance for current-quarter sales, and sending shares -9% lower in late trading for the custom microchip maker.\n\n\n\nAffirm AFRM numbers flew by expectations on both earnings and sales, posting 20 cents per share versus the 11-cent estimate on $876 million in revenues, well above the $839.9 million analysts were looking for. Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) well outperformed estimates to $10.4 billion in the quarter.\n\n\n\nUlta Beauty ULTA is putting on a good face following today\u2019s close, posting Q2 results well ahead of expectations: earnings of $5.78 per share on $2.79 billion in quarterly sales surged beyond the $5.03 per share and $2.65 billion, respectively. Comps more than doubled expectations to +6.7%, and shares are up +6% in late trading.",

  "summary": "The Dow and S&P 500 all closed at record highs, with the Dow growing by +71 points, +0.16%, and the S&T 500 gaining by 20 points.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported a negative July Pending Homes Sales, with month-over-month numbers lowest in the Midwest (-4.0%), Northeast (-0.6%) and South (-1%), only the West region saw a significant increase. Autodesk ADSK shares are up +11% on its Q2 report, with Q2 earnings exceeding the Zacks consensus on revenues of $1.76 billion.

The NAR reported a modest decline in pending home sales but a rise in expected home\u2011buying traffic, while the Fed funds rate outlook remains uncertain. Corporate earnings were mixed: Autodesk, Dell, Marvell, and others posted beats or flat results, with AI demand highlighted by Dell and Marvell's guidance cuts.",
