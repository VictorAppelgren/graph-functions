      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits (compact paragraph)**  \nYour draft is ambitious but needs tighter focus, stronger first‑principles logic, and rigorous sourcing. 1) **Scope & Structure** – separate the analysis into three logical blocks (commodity supply & ESG, U.S. monetary policy, and global capital flows/geopolitics). 2) **Regime Definition** – explicitly state the current regime (“ESG‑driven commodity supply constraint + Fed perceived loss of independence + rising geopolitical risk”) and the transition conditions (e.g., moratorium enforcement, Fed rate cuts, summit outcome). 3) **Causal Chain** – map each anchor to market pricing: e.g., moratorium → supply‑side constraint → real‑rate differential (USD vs commodity currencies) → terms‑of‑trade → commodity price. 4) **Quantification** – replace vague “5–10 %” with ranges backed by data: soybean export volume 97 Mt (J54PXL0NV), deforestation drop 69 % (J54PXL0NV), Fed cut probability 79 % (IBGK2IRII). 5) **Citation Density** – insert inline citations after every factual claim (e.g., “97 Mt in 2024 (J54PXL0NV)”, “USD probability of cut 79 % (IBGK2IRII)”). 6) **Scenario Structure** – outline a base case, upside (Fed cuts + moratorium upheld), downside (Fed hike + moratorium lifted + summit fails) with clear catalysts and invalidation points. 7) **Avoid Generic Sentences** – e.g., replace “Fed perceived loss of independence” with “Trump’s request for Cook’s resignation (IBGK2IRII) has raised risk‑premia on U.S. Treasuries by X basis points (source needed).” 8) **Reconcile Conflicts** – explicitly note that USD depreciation feeds commodity prices, but a Fed hike would reverse this trend; quantify the expected yield shift. 9) **Length/Format** – trim redundant sentences, keep each paragraph focused, and ensure the final piece fits the prescribed word limit. 10) **Add Confidence Rating** – state a confidence level (e.g., “medium‑high”) and list key monitoring signals (Jackson Hole remarks, Brazilian court rulings, summit outcome). Implement these edits to elevate the analysis to world‑class quality.",
