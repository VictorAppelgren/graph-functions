  "description": "The NFL is easing some restrictions on Tom Brady as he prepares for his second season as Fox Sports' top analyst",
  "content": "Brady was allowed to attend production meetings with Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles players and coaches before Super Bowl 59. He wasn't able to view practices.\n\n\u201cThe ability to join and be able to talk to a coach, coordinators or players and help him prepare for his job was one that felt like a natural step forward,\u201d Hans Schroeder, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president of media distribution, told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nMany of the network broadcast crews have done their production meetings with teams virtually, even though some still prefer getting into a city on Friday to watch the home team and then talk to the visiting team at their hotel the next day.\n\nBefore the Super Bowl, Brady said that not being allowed in production meetings did not affect his research when preparing for games, even though there were other benefits he acknowledged he missed.\n\n\u201cI think the best part (of production meetings) is there are just genuine relationships that get built up over time, and it\u2019s a shared experience with people on your own crew sitting on calls and talking,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrom a research standpoint, I listen to press conferences all week. To me, there\u2019s no difference in a media member asking a question on a Wednesday, Thursday or Friday press conference that would be any different from any of the questions I would ask or the crew would ask.\u201d\n\nFox's top crew of Brady, Kevin Burkhardt, Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi will call the NFC East matchup between the New York Giants and Washington Commanders on Sept. 7 before the Eagles face the Chiefs in a Super Bowl rematch the following week.\n\nFox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager said in an interview with the AP earlier this year that any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling games and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",

      "text": "Fox exec calls Brady rumors \u2018a never-ending, merry-go-round\u2019 of narratives\nFox exec calls Brady rumors \u2018a never-ending, merry-go-round\u2019 of narratives\nEven as Tom Brady goes through his first postseason and prepares to call his first Super Bowl as a television analyst, rumors about his future continue to be rampant, much to the dismay of Fox Sports.\nFox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager understands the spotlight Brady and the network are under. Still, Zager said Brady is in it for the long haul.\n\u201cThe whole group that said he would never be there then turned into, he\u2019s not going to stay there. It\u2019s just a never-ending, merry-go-round of people trying to come up with the next narrative,\u201d Zager said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cTom has done nothing but be engaged with us every time he\u2019s asked about broadcasting. When he was retired and getting in, getting ready, he talked about how excited he was for it, that he was 100% and has never wavered on that. So the fact that there are people on that crew that have to read articles and narratives and predictions that Tom isn\u2019t engaged does wear on you.\u201d\nZager\u2019s comments on Friday were the first about Brady by someone from Fox Sports. Brady has not been made available for media interviews this season. He has discussed his first season in the booth during appearances on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.\nOn Thursday, Don Yee, Brady\u2019s agent, told Sports Business Journal that Brady \u201chas had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s really excited about the future with Fox.\u201d Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.\n\u201cTom has had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s excited about the future with Fox and his growth on their team,\u201d Yee said. \u201cAnd this year was the first year of a long relationship.\u201d\nYee did not return an email or text message by the AP seeking comment.\nFox Sports has tried to weather the rumors and criticism surrounding Brady\u2019s future and his dual roles as the analyst on its NFL crew and minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.\nEverything has come to a head this week with Brady and Kevin Burkhardt calling Saturday night\u2019s NFC divisional round game in Detroit between the Lions and the Washington Commanders.\nLions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn are candidates for the Raiders\u2019 head coach opening. Brady is involved in the franchise\u2019s coach and general manager selection.\nBrady cannot participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex. The only team complex Brady is allowed in is the Raiders.\nThe league put those parameters in place going into the season after Brady purchased a 5% stake in the Raiders in May 2023. NFL owners approved the purchase last October.\nZager said any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling the game and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s questioning his professionalism and integrity. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Zager said.\nAny questions Brady would have for the coordinators or head coach Dan Campbell could be asked by Burkhardt or a member of the Fox crew in the production meetings. However, Brady receives the same film and statistical information as everyone else on the crew.\n\u201cAnytime you\u2019re around crew members and doing something as a crew, that\u2019s a good thing for the crew. So, we\u2019ve have to overcome that. You\u2019re not going to have that time to bond,\u201d Zager said. \u201cBut when it comes to analyzing the game and learning information, what is available at the fingertips of the average fan now is probably light years ahead of what was available even to the broadcast crew 15-20 years ago. Not being in the meetings has not stopped him from growing as an analyst throughout the season.\u201d\nBrady\u2019s analysis of teams and officiating is subject to more scrutiny by the league because of his stake in the Raiders, but it would have to be egregiously critical or call into question the integrity of a team or referee.\nZager pointed out that Brady has been critical of play calls or strategy, just like any analyst is expected to do.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to watch Tom jump into this, having no broadcast experience, and calling the NFL\u2019s biggest games. He continues to find his rhythm and those spots where he can really shine during a game,\u201d Zager said. \u201cI think he\u2019s hitting a great stride as we head to the postseason in our biggest games. And I\u2019m looking forward to these next three games, which are three biggest games, and what he\u2019s going to add to the broadcast.\u201d\nAttention and rumors about Fox\u2019s top NFL crew are nothing new. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck\u2019s future during the 2021 season was constant fodder before both moved to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d Brady, though, did take a lot of pressure off the network before Super Bowl 57 in 2023 when he said early in the week leading up to the game that he wouldn\u2019t be joining Fox in 2023, which allowed Greg Olsen to answer questions about the game instead of his future and not be a one-year, lame duck analyst on a top network team.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"

  "argos_summary": "Tom Brady, now a Fox Sports analyst and minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, is barred from team production meetings, practice viewings, and any team facilities except the Raiders, a restriction the NFL imposed after his ownership stake was approved. Despite these limits, Brady says the lack of in\u2011person meetings hasn\u2019t hindered his game preparation, relying on press conferences and standard crew resources. Fox executives, including Brad Zager, dismiss conflict\u2011of\u2011interest concerns and praise Brady\u2019s enthusiasm and growing proficiency in broadcasting, while rumors about his future with the network persist. The article also notes Brady\u2019s 10\u2011year, $375\u202fmillion contract with Fox and his agent\u2019s comments on his excitement for the partnership.",
