  "content": "An English tourist who hit and killed a man while riding an e-scooter in Australia pleaded guilty on Monday to a charge of dangerous driving causing death while under the influence of alcohol.\n\nAlicia Kemp, 25, admitted the charge during a hearing at the Western Australia Magistrate\u2019s Court, officials told The Associated Press. Kemp was riding an e-scooter with a passenger on board in the city of Perth on May 31 when she hit a 51-year-old man, Australian news outlets reported.\n\nThanh Phan hit his head on the pavement and later died in a hospital. Kemp and the scooter\u2019s passenger received minor injuries.\n\nKemp was visiting Western Australia state from Britain on a working holiday visa, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Investigators estimated she was driving at about the maximum speed of a rental e-scooter, 20 to 25 kph (12 to 16 mph), when she crashed into Phan, the court was told at an earlier hearing.\n\nA charge of causing harm to the passenger was dropped when Kemp made the appearance via video link from jail on Monday. She was earlier refused bail.\n\nMike Tudori, Kemp\u2019s lawyer, told reporters outside the court that his client was \u201cnervous and worried\u201d as \u201ca young foreign national girl\u201d in an Australian jail.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obviously done something stupid at the time,\u201d he said, according to Australian Associated Press. \u201cShe obviously wasn\u2019t thinking, level-headed and there\u2019s consequences, and she just wants to get on with her life.\u201d\n\nPhan\u2019s family described him as a \u201cbeloved husband, father of two, brother and dear friend,\u201d according to the AAP.\n\nKemp will remain in custody until her next court appearance on Oct. 31, when a sentencing date will be set. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nOfficials in Perth suspended e-scooter rental in the city after Phan\u2019s death, which was the fifth involving e-vehicles in the state in 2025. The state\u2019s government also launched an inquiry into the vehicles.\n\nMelbourne, in Victoria state, was in 2024 the first Australian city to ban e-scooter hire. The move echoed prohibitions in some other cities worldwide, including Paris, France, where a ban was overwhelmingly approved in April 2023.",

      "text": "Residents of Paris have voted in favor of banning rental electric scooters from the French capital.\nAlmost 90% of those who turned out on Sunday for a referendum organized by the Paris mayor\u2019s office voted for the ban.\nThe turnout was very low, however, with only 7.46% of registered voters casting their ballots in one of the 203 polling stations opened for the occasion.\n\u201cOn September 1, there will be no more rental scooters in Paris. \u2026 This is a victory for local democracy,\u201d Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said at a press conference over the weekend.\nThe ban will come into force at the end of August, when the city\u2019s scooter operators\u2019 contracts expire. Private owners of e-scooters won\u2019t be affected.\nOperators responded swiftly to the news of the referendum result.\n\u201cThe real consequence is for our 400,000 monthly users, for the 800 employees of Dott in Paris. Then it\u2019s also for the residents since, mathematically speaking, if we subtract the scooters, it\u2019s more saturation in public transport and more individual vehicles,\u201d Nicolas Gorse, chief business officer of scooter operator Dott, told RMC radio on Monday morning.\nIn recent years, Paris has introduced a variety of measures aimed at reducing the city\u2019s dependence on private cars and boosting the appeal of other modes of travel. Bike lanes, subsidized e-bike rentals, improved public transportation and e-scooter rentals have all been part of that campaign.\nBetween mid-2012 and mid-2022, the most recent year for which data is available, there was a 33% drop in traffic on Paris\u2019 roads, according to the city hall.\nHowever, in a report last November, the French academy of medicine described e-scooters as a \u201ctrue public health problem,\u201d and highlighted that \u201celectric scooter-related accidents are associated with a significant number of serious injuries.\u201d\nParis police do not collect figures for injuries and deaths caused specifically by e-scooters. However, between 2021 and 2022, the number of crashes involving \u201cmotorized personal transport devices\u201d \u2013 which includes e-scooters, gyropods and motorized skateboards \u2013 rose by nearly a third, to 516 accidents, resulting in three deaths, police said.\nParis isn\u2019t the only European city to be grappling with e-scooters. Barcelona was an early champion, but it has partially banned them in historic parts of the city since 2016.\nIn London, privately owned e-scooters remain illegal for use on public roads, but public trials have been running with three operators since mid-2021.\nCNN\u2019s Sana Noor Haq, Aurore Laborie, Alex Hardie and Oliver Briscoe contributed reporting."
