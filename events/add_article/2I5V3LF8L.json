      "summary": "The article highlights a contrarian opportunity in the stagnant healthcare sector, noting that while the S&P 500 has surged 27% since early April, healthcare stocks remain flat. It lists seven high-yield healthcare REITs—Omega Healthcare, LTC Properties, Healthpeak, Sila Realty, and others—each offering yields above 6% and potential upside from operational improvements and structural changes like RIDEA contracts. The piece also discusses high-yield pharmaceutical names such as Pfizer and Bristol‑Myers Squibb, noting their dividend attractiveness amid declining sales and patent cliffs, and suggests these stocks could serve as income plays for investors seeking yield in a low‑growth environment.",
