      "feedback": "The draft has solid traction (cloud/AI secular thesis, MSFT metrics, labor/automation angle, EV/tariff ambiguity, and a macro regime overlay), but it largely undercuts world-class quality by (1) drifting out of scope content, (2) weakly stated probability anchors, (3) shallow, non-principal causal chaining, (4) uneven use of numbers versus generic statements, and (5) inconsistent citation discipline. Actionable edits to lift it:\n\n- Fix Movers to exactly 4 lines: 2 Up and 2 Down, 3–6 month horizon, each with a tight Driver/Mechanism, a single crisp “What to watch” that links to a measurable catalyst, and an explicit invalidation trigger. Remove the 0–3 week hardware section and any other non-conforming material; ensure each line cites only when asserting a fact or number. For example, Up1 could anchor to MSFT cloud/Azure momentum with a fact like 18% revenue growth and 39% Azure/AI growth (0G3A676BP); Up2 could anchor to the labor/automation channel with Just Capital/workers data (4LQD15CFU). Down1 should explicitly name Rivian/Tesla EV-margin/tariff risk with a concrete milestone (R2 timing, $45k price target, DOE loan of $6.6B from P0K0UEOHU); Down2 should anchor to macro/regime risks (BoJ wage dynamics, A7VLN74BK; C3ODMIQKZ). \n- Tighten the probability construct to reflect material evidence: the base-case regime implies a 70% macro-easing path with a 20% upside and 10% downside. If you must keep four tail lines, allocate probabilities that collectively reflect that framework and label them as tail vs base-case contributions (e.g., Up1 20%, Up2 10%, Down1 35%, Down2 35% with a note tying these to “tail scenarios” while the base-case 70% sits outside these four lines). At minimum, ensure the numbers sum to 100% and explicitly justify each line with the cited material.\n- Strengthen first-principles grounding and scenario structure: add a concise three-step causal chain for each line (drivers → transmission to valuations/asset pricing → observable watchpoints). Tie Up lines to productivity-levering fundamentals (cloud/AI discount-rate relief, moaty software cash flow) and Down lines to regime risks (policy/tariff shocks, EV subsidies, wage-driven rate volatility). Explicitly name the catalysts and invalidation events (e.g., “Rivian R2 launch delays” or “toe-in of tariff policy”).\n- Sharpen the “What to watch” with quantitative, source-backed thresholds and avoid generic phrasing; place in-line citations immediately after the numeric fact or milestone (e.g., “Rivian’s EBITDA breakeven by 2027” (P0K0UEOHU) or “DOE loan of $6.6B” (P0K0UEOHU)).\n- Align Outlook to SECTION FOCUS format: keep to 1 line if tradable; if non-tradable, present the one-line Outlook with Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100, and ensure it mirrors the 3–6 month window and the 70/20/10 framework; simplify to a tight, action-ready statement (e.g., Direction Up or Down | Horizon 3–6 months | Expected path/levels anchored to a clear level band | Trigger: CPI or FOMC signal; Invalidation: CPI surprise or policy shift; Probability %: 70/20/10 split across base and tail; Confidence: 65–70). \n- Citation discipline and consistency: remove uncited assertions; ensure every factual claim tied to a source is accompanied by a single in-text ID and that IDs used correspond to the cited facts (0G3A676BP, 4LQD15CFU, P0K0UEOHU, A7VLN74BK, C3ODMIQKZ, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, GX057ADL7, V7GV8YBQU, ILYC1M41F, DGICB, JVKCZAPVG as appropriate). Reconcile any conflicts across sources by stating a concise cross-source note in-line (e.g., “EV policy dispersion vs. cloud/AI discount-rate impulse” with citations).\n- Clean up formatting and ensure no trailing lists or sections leak into the Movers/Outlook: keep the 4-line Movers strictly in scope, and the Outlook strictly as 1 line (or 2 at most) with the required fields; eliminate any extraneous paragraphs or nonessential numerical chatter outside those sections.\n\nIn short: tighten horizon-specific, first-principles rationale; anchor every number to a source; enforce a clean 4-line Up/Up/Down/Down structure with explicit catalysts and invalidations; correct probability weights to reflect the material’s 70/20/10 framework; prune non-conforming content; and ensure the Outlook follows the exact 1-line (or 2-line max) format with a crisp Trigger and an explicit Invalidation, all with disciplined, minimal citations.",
