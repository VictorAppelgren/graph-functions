  "content": "Piers Morgan\u2019s attempt to wish President Donald Trump well ahead of his summit with Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t go as planned.\n\nWhile the British broadcaster praised the president in an X post Friday morning as someone who \u201cgenuinely prefers peace to war,\u201d the image he attached sent quite a different message.\n\nMorgan soon deleted the post, and explained in a follow-up message that he didn\u2019t see the mockingly Photoshopped protective wear at first. He then reposted his original sentiment with another photograph\u2014this one lifted from Fox News\u2019 X account.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s meeting with his Russian counterpart is taking place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. It is the first in-person meeting between Putin and a U.S. president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nTrump\u2014who repeatedly pledged during the 2024 presidential campaign that he would end the Russia-Ukraine War within 24 hours of taking office or even sooner\u2014said on the flight to Alaska Friday that he would \u201cnot be happy\u201d if Putin didn\u2019t agree to stop the hostilities against its neighbor.\n\nThe president told Fox News aboard Air Force One that he might \u201cwalk\u201d if the meeting was unsatisfactory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going for a meeting with President Putin in Alaska,\u201d Trump told Fox News anchor Bret Baier. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s going to work out very well, and if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to head back home real fast.\u201d\n\nHours later, Trump warmly welcomed Putin onto U.S. soil with a military flyover, a stroll on the red carpet, and a private ride together in The Beast, Trump\u2019s presidential limousine. The president also clapped for Putin, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, as the Russian leader approached him.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump has given Russian President Vladimir Putin the red carpet treatment as they arrived for their historic summit, applauding the authoritarian and offering him a rare ride in the presidential limousine known as The Beast.\nAs the pair landed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson Friday\u2014three years after Russia invaded Ukraine\u2014Trump greeted Putin with a military flyover and a handshake before the pair smiled for the cameras on a makeshift podium.\nThe extraordinary scene was the first time Putin, who has been largely frozen out by the West, has been on U.S. soil in 10 years.\nIt was also the first time an American president has given the VIP treatment to a Russian leader who faces an arrest warrant for war crimes issued by the International Criminal Court as well as being sanctioned by the U.S. government.\nAhead of the meeting, Trump told reporters that he hoped to broker a ceasefire with Putin but was prepared to \u201cwalk out\u201d if they failed to reach a deal.\nThe White House initially said the historic summit would be \u201cone-on-one.\u201d However, moments before touchdown, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declared it would now be a three-on-three session, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff also joining.\nPutin was accompanied by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov.\nIt is not clear what exactly the meeting will achieve in terms of a deal, given Putin\u2019s obsession with claiming Ukraine as his own and his ongoing reluctance to negotiate for a ceasefire.\nHowever, several incentives will likely be used as leverage. Among them is the possibility of opening up some of Alaska\u2019s natural resources to Russia and offering part of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals to Putin\u2014a proposal that has already faced staunch criticism.\n\u201cSo hang on... Trump is going to offer to open up [sic] ALASKA TO THE RUSSIANS??\u201d Trump critic and former GOP Congressman Adam Kinzinger wrote on X. \u201cWow. Let\u2019s see Republicans defend this.\u201d\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One that Putin was looking for business opportunities in America and \u201cif we make progress, I would discuss it.\u201d\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s one of the things that they would like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d like to get a piece of what I\u2019ve built in terms of the economy.\u201d\nHe also said territorial swaps would be discussed, but added: \u201cI\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision, and I think they\u2019ll make a proper decision. But I\u2019m not here to negotiate for Ukraine.\u201d\nOne person was notably missing from the meeting: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who posted a video on social media on Friday pointing out that Russian military strikes continued throughout Ukraine.\n\u201cOn the day of negotiations, the Russians are killing as well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that speaks volumes. ... We hope for a strong position from America. Everything depends on this.\u201d\nTrump had earlier bristled at suggestions that the summit was a gift to Putin, but Russia state media were delighted at the images of his red carpet treatment on Friday.\nIt is somewhat rare for a world leader to get a ride in the presidential limousine.\nIn his first term, Trump also gave then Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a ride to his Florida golf course, and in 2010, then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev rode with Barack Obama in The Beast."

      "text": "He wasn\u2019t joking.\nWhen President Donald Trump was reminded in an interview with Time magazine this week that he had said he would end the Russian war on Ukraine on \u201cday one,\u201d he claimed he hadn\u2019t been speaking literally or seriously.\n\u201cWell, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended,\u201d Trump said, according to Time\u2019s transcript.\nThis \u201cin jest\u201d claim is a lie.\nOn the campaign trail in 2023 and 2024, Trump said on dozens of occasions, in an entirely serious tone, manner and context, that he would end the war in Ukraine either within 24 hours of his return to the White House or even sooner than that. He said over and over again, including at both presidential debates of 2024, that he would have the war \u201csettled\u201d when he was president-elect, before his inauguration.\nA Friday search of the Roll Call Factba.se database that catalogues Trump\u2019s public remarks turned up at least 53 examples of Trump making such comments.\nIt\u2019s sometimes hard to determine the intent of a politician\u2019s one-time ad-libs, but this was no jovial ad-lib. Rather, the promise of a rapid end to the war was a sober staple of Trump\u2019s pre-written rally remarks. He framed the promise as a key component of his second-term agenda, and he justified it with claims about his \u201ccredibility\u201d as a leader, his history as a \u201cpeacemaker,\u201d and his knowledge of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nTrump sometimes emphasized that he was speaking literally, scoffing at critics who said he couldn\u2019t end the war that fast. \u201cI\u2019ll get that done within 24 hours. Everyone says, \u2018Oh, no, you can\u2019t.\u2019 Absolutely I can. Absolutely I can,\u201d he said at one July 2023 rally in Iowa. He said at a Pennsylvania rally later that month: \u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we all together win the presidency, we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled. The war is going to be settled. I\u2019ll get them both \u2013 I know Zelensky, I know Putin, it\u2019ll be done within 24 hours, you watch. They all say, \u2018That\u2019s such a boast.\u2019 It will be done very quickly.\u201d\nHere are the 53 examples. There might well be more; this isn\u2019t intended as an exhaustive list.\nMarch 4, 2023. Speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled quickly. Quickly. I will get the problem solved and I will get it solved in rapid order and it will take me no longer than one day. I know exactly what to say to each of them.\u201d\nMarch 25, 2023. Rally in Waco, Texas.\n\u201cAnd before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled.\u201d And: \u201cSo when I say \u2018end it,\u2019 I\u2019m going to get a settlement very quickly. And I know both people, and you can get it very, very quickly. You can only do it through the presidency, but you control the money coming in, coming out. You can get that. I will have that settlement done within 24 hours.\u201d\nApril 21, 2023. Speech to Republican dinner in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled.

Rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled.\u201d\nMay 10, 2023. CNN town hall in Goffstown, New Hampshire.\nTrump: \u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins: \u201cHow would you settle that war in one day?\u201d Trump: \u201cFirst, I\u2019ll meet with Putin, I\u2019ll meet with Zelensky. They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths. And within 24 hours that war will be settled. It will be over. It will be absolutely over.\u201d\nJune 10, 2023. Speech to North Carolina GOP convention in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\u201cHere\u2019s just some of the bold agenda I\u2019ll put into effect when we become the 47th president of the United States. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled if it\u2019s not already settled, and they should get it done quickly.\u201d\nJune 24, 2023. Speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Washington, DC.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine totally settled. I\u2019ll have it done in 24 hours. I say that, and I would do that. That\u2019s easy compared to some of the things \u2013 I\u2019d get that done in 24 hours. I know them both. I know them both. As the Bible says, \u2018Blessed are the peacemakers.\u2019 See that? And I will be your peacemaker. I was your peacemaker.\u201d\nJune 27, 2023. Speech to Republican women in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\u201cI get along with him (Zelensky), get along with Putin, I\u2019d have that war \u2013 it would have never happened under me, never ever, would have never happened \u2013 but I\u2019ll have that war settled in 24 hours. And it won\u2019t even be a tough one by comparison to other things.\u201d\nJune 30, 2023. Speech to Moms for Liberty in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we all together win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be done within 24 hours.\u201d\nJuly 1, 2023. Rally in Pickens, South Carolina.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency because of you, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled; I\u2019ll get it done in 24 hours.

Rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled.\u201d And: \u201cI\u2019ll get that done within 24 hours.

Rally in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we all together win the presidency, we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled. The war is going to be settled. I\u2019ll get them both \u2013 I know Zelensky, I know Putin, it\u2019ll be done within 24 hours, you watch.

      "text": "It\u2019s the art of the deal.\nPresident Donald Trump admitted to Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier that if things don\u2019t go well during the high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, he might \u201cwalk.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going for a meeting with President Putin in Alaska,\u201d Trump told Baier Friday. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s going to work out very well, and if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to head back home real fast.\u201d\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, you walk?\u201d Baier asked.\n\u201cI would walk, yeah,\u201d Trump said.\nBaier joined Trump on Air Force One en route to Alaska, where the summit will take place Friday.\nTrump said on the campaign trail that he could end the Russia-Ukraine war on day one of his presidency. He has expressed increasing frustration over his inability to strike a deal. In July, he threatened to impose further sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to a peace deal within 50 days but has since walked back the timeline.\nOn Wednesday, Trump confessed that he would not be able to convince Putin to stop targeting Ukrainian civilians.\n\u201cI guess the answer to that is \u2018no,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve had this conversation ... I\u2019ve had a lot of good conversations with him [Putin]. Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home or a rocket hit an apartment building, and people are lying dead in the streets.\u201d\nAlthough Trump has long touted his ability to negotiate with Putin, he admitted this week that investigations into Russia\u2019s interference with elections in the United States, which the president refers to as \u201cthe Russian hoax,\u201d have \u201cput a strain on the relationship.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s aides also have low expectations, calling the Friday peace summit in Anchorage a \u201clistening exercise.\u201d It will be the first meeting between a U.S. president and Putin since Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022.\n\u201cWhat comes after that meeting is up to President Trump, and that\u2019s part of the reason he is going,\u201d Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox & Friends on Thursday. \u201cHe has incredible instincts, and he wants to sit down and look the Russian president in the eye and see what progress can be made to move the ball forward to end this brutal war.\u201d\nTrump told Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio Thursday that there is a \u201c25 percent chance this meeting will not be a successful meeting.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump literally rolled out the red carpet for Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.\nTrump, 79, veered from left to right as he walked on the carpet, unable to stay in its center, before reaching a set meeting point. Trump then stood and clapped as the American adversary, 72, approached him at Joint Base Elmendorf in Anchorage.\nOnce together, the two men shook hands before Trump waddled at Putin\u2019s side toward a platform. Above, a U.S. Air Force B-2 stealth bomber and four F-35 fighter jets completed a flyover that caused Putin to pause and briefly look up.\nThe world leaders stopped atop the platform, posed for photos behind a sign reading \u201cAlaska 2025,\u201d and shuffled down three steps and into an all-black Escalade. Trump invited Putin to descend the stairs first, placing his hand on the Russian\u2019s back.\nBoth men avoided an embarrassing slip or stumble, and they appeared comfortable with each other, chatting as they sauntered forward. Once inside a U.S. government SUV, cameras captured Putin smiling and waving to the press corps outside.\nThe eyes of the world are on Friday\u2019s summit, which is regarding Russia\u2019s bloody war in Ukraine.\nTrump is expected to push Putin to reach a ceasefire agreement, but the White House has tempered expectations of what will actually be accomplished, especially without a representative of Ukraine\u2014like its president, Volodymyr Zelensky\u2014present.\nSome U.S. officials and pundits have criticized Trump for welcoming Putin and other Russian officials onto an active U.S. military base. The duo last met in 2018, during a summit in Helsinki, Finland, that was widely labeled a disaster for Trump."

  "argos_summary": "Piers Morgan mistakenly posted a photoshopped image while praising President Trump ahead of his Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, then deleted it and reposted a correct photo from Fox News. Trump, who has repeatedly promised to end the Russia\u2011Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office, flew to Anchorage to meet Putin, offering a red\u2011carpet welcome, a fly\u2011over, and a ride in the presidential limousine. The summit, the first U.S. president\u2011to\u2011president meeting since 2022, is seen as a listening exercise with limited expectations, as Ukraine\u2019s president is absent and the White House has tempered hopes for a concrete ceasefire. Trump has warned he could walk out if the talks fail, while critics question the legitimacy and potential consequences of hosting a war\u2011crimes\u2011charged leader on U.S. soil.",
