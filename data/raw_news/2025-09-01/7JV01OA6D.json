  "content": "Frontline staff see managers as a key source of important information. If you cut this link, it could hurt your bottom line.\n\nSeeking a flatter management structure is a leadership trend you could compare to fashion\u2019s craze for skinny jeans \u2014 trendy yesterday, forgotten tomorrow, then back in fashion again before you know it. Recently big tech firms like Meta, Microsoft and Google made headlines for cutting management positons to lower costs and increase productivity \u2014 turning some of their workloads over to AI tools.\n\nBut a new survey from San Francisco-based workplace communications outfit Firstup shows that eliminating too many management jobs can have some unexpected effects on the way your teams work, sometimes damaging employee engagement, which undermines productivity. This is definitely something to bear in mind if you\u2019re considering restructuring your own company\u2019s management ranks. The survey\u2019s top results show that employees think middle management layers are crucial to the company success. More than half the people surveyed said their direct manager was their \u201cmost trusted source\u201d for up to date workplace news on \u2014 compared to just 10 percent who think that senior leadership is their best source for this information. Interestingly, the Firstup survey, which quizzed 1,000 U.S.-based, full-time non-managerial employees at companies that carried out layoffs in the last year, shows that junior staff think that their middle management layers are critical to their well-being at work. Fully 75 percent of respondents said they rely on managers for recognition and appreciation, 63 percent said they relied on them for helping tackle workplace challenges, while 50 percent said they seek coaching and development advice from managers. Meanwhile, 86 percent of people said they relied on managers to \u201ctranslate\u201d company updates into meaningful advice about what changes mean for individual workers.\n\nThis paints a picture of junior staff relying on their layers of middle management as a trust and information barrier between themselves and senior leadership \u2014 perhaps hinting at an \u201civory tower\u201d syndrome surrounding senior management. Other survey details offer a deeper view of what happens when layoffs hit the management structure of a company. Fully 38 percent of survey respondents said that since their company experienced layoffs, their manager had become less accessible. This has had consequences: 30 percent of people said they\u2019d felt less support when things were disrupted or changed, 34 percent expected they\u2019ll lose a sense of connection and 30 percent expected decreased or zero access for mentorship and career development options.\n\nEmployees also don\u2019t trust senior leaders, with nearly 40 percent saying they can\u2019t get mentorship or guidance from upper management, 37 percent saying they feel unheard by the top leaders, and only 47 percent agreeing that their company leadership is \u201csomewhat\u201d transparent. This paints an interesting picture of how the average U.S. worker views their management, relying on their direct supervisors while apparently distrusting upper layers of company leadership. The report quotes Firstup CEO Bill Schuh, who explained that the data show workers see middle managers as critical for \u201ctranslating organizational priorities into action, clarity, and connection for their direct report.\u201d As companies shed middle managers, they risk losing this vital link, which can leave frontline workers feeling lost and unsupported. That discontent will likely diminish their engagement with their work, and could reduce their productivity. Meanwhile Schuh also noted that stripping managers out adds strain on their remaining colleagues. That means companies are \u201casking fewer managers to do more, and that simply is not sustainable,\u201d he said. While AI is useful for handling some mundane managerial tasks, it \u201cwon\u2019t replace the human connection and leadership that great managers provide.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean for your company? In smaller organizations, there may be more of a direct line of communication between senior leaders and frontline workers: but these data are still important. If you\u2019re considering trimming your intermediate management structure, you should consider how this will impact employee trust and expectations for career advancement. Open and frank conversations may improve levels of trust among your employees and help support their engagement and productivity during times of upheaval.",

      "text": "New Firstup survey highlights critical role of frontline managers\namid layoffs and leaner leadership structures\nSAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Firstup, the pioneer of the intelligent communication platform for the workforce, today released the results of its Manager Impact Survey, which uncovers how recent reductions in the middle management layer create communication gaps and threaten the employee experience and organizational productivity. The findings underscore the vital role direct managers play in communication, mentorship, and coaching, and what is at stake when they are spread too thin.\nFirstup surveyed 1,000 U.S.-based, full-time non-managerial employees whose organizations experienced layoffs in the past year. The survey results reveal a dependence on direct managers as the primary source of company information, clarity, and human-centric support.\nTop findings include:\n- Managers are the most trusted source of information. More than half (52%) say their direct manager is their most trusted source for company updates, while only 10% say the same of senior leadership.\n- Employees rely on managers for more than just updates. 53% turn to their manager first with work-related questions, and a striking 86% rely on them to translate company updates into what those changes mean for their individual role.\n- Managers are essential to employee growth and well-being. Nearly two-thirds of employees (63%) rely on their manager for support navigating work challenges, and half (50%) turn to them for coaching and professional development.\n- Employees depend on managers for meaningful workplace experiences. Three-quarters (75%) rely on their manager for recognition and appreciation, and 82% for clear task and process guidance.\n- Career growth is manager-dependent. A majority of employees (72%) rely on their manager for career coaching and feedback.\n\"Managers are critical for relaying information, as well as translating organizational priorities into action, clarity, and connection for their direct reports,\" said Bill Schuh, CEO of Firstup. \"As companies adopt leaner organizational models and reduce middle management layers, they risk losing the vital link between leadership and the rest of the workforce, jeopardizing communication, trust, and employee engagement\u2013all of which are necessary to deliver and sustain high performance.\"\nIn today's workplace, frontline managers are left to bridge widening communication and execution gaps often without the resources or support needed to keep up:\n- Managers are being stretched too thin. More than one-third (38%) of employees report their manager has become less accessible since layoffs.\n- Employees anticipate negative consequences as their managers become less available.\n- Feeling unsupported: Nearly one-third (30%) say they'd feel less supported during times of change or disruption.\n- Lack of direction and recognition: 22% would feel overwhelmed by unclear direction, and 21% would feel unseen or unrecognized for their contributions.\n- Information gaps: More than half (56%) would only be \"somewhat confident\" in getting the information they need to do their job well.\n- Weakened connection and growth: 34% anticipate losing a sense of connection, and nearly 30% expect decreased or eliminated access to mentorship and career development opportunities.\n- Senior leadership isn't filling the gap. Nearly 40% of employees say senior leadership fails to provide mentorship or career guidance, 37% feel unheard and unsupported, and 47% rate leadership as only somewhat transparent.\n\"We're asking fewer managers to do more, and that simply is not sustainable,\" added Schuh. \"AI and technology won't replace the human connection and leadership that great managers provide, but they can address the communication and engagement gaps that have arisen. With the right tools, organizations can automate updates, deliver critical role-specific information, measure workforce engagement on key topics and initiatives, and give managers the space to lead with empathy and impact.\"\nTo review the full survey results, read: Vanishing middle management & the communication gaps they leave behind.\nMethodology:\nFirstup surveyed 1,000 U.S.-based, full-time, non-managerial workers whose organizations had experienced layoffs within the last 12 months.
