  "description": "Bloomberg reported Thursday that the Trump administration is exploring taking a stake directly in struggling chipmaker Intel.",
  "content": "Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped more than 7% on Thursday following a report the US government is considering taking a stake in the struggling chipmaker.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the plan could see the government help Intel build out its planned chip complex in Ohio, which the company has had to delay as part of its ongoing turnaround effort. Intel announced the facility in 2022 with an initial investment of $20 billion that could grow to $100 billion over time.\n\nThe report follows President Trump's meeting with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan on Monday.\n\nThe Ohio site was supposed to include two new manufacturing plants and start producing chips by 2025, but that's since been delayed into the 2030s. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over when former CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the company's board due to the slow turnaround in 2024, has since delayed the plant even further.\n\nThe Trump administration is making a major push to reshore American chip manufacturing.\n\nIntel and rivals TSMC (TSM), Samsung, and others, have been working to build more chip fabricating plants in the US since the Biden administration signed the CHIPS Act in 2022.\n\nPart of Intel's plan under Gelsinger was to turn Intel into a contract chip manufacturer, similar to TSMC. But the gambit has run into trouble. So far, the foundry's main customer is still Intel, and the company is reportedly facing headwinds in getting its 18A chip technology up to the level needed to statisfy clients.\n\nIntel has signed agreements to build chips for Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) using its chip designs.\n\nTrump initially called for Tan to resign as CEO of Intel due to his investments in Chinese tech firms, but backed away from the stance after meeting with him on Monday.\n\nIntel is still far away from making any meaningful headway in the AI space, ceding the market to both Nvidia and rival AMD.\n\nEarlier this week, the White House announced the US government will take a 15% cut of the sale of Nvidia and AMD chips shipped to China, an unconventional arrangement that highlights the government's increased focus on the semiconductor industry.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "text": "Intel stock jumps after Trump calls meeting with CEO Lip-Bu Tan 'interesting,' signals more talks ahead\nIn this article:\nIntel (INTC) stock jumped more than 3% in premarket trading on Tuesday after CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with President Trump, who had called for Tan's resignation last week.\nAfter the meeting, Trump posted to Truth Social that he had met with Tan along with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. \"The meeting was a very interesting one,\" the president wrote, adding, \"His success and rise is an amazing story.\"\nTrump said Tan and his Cabinet will \"spend time together\" and \"bring suggestions\" to him in the next week, without specifying the topics to be discussed.\nIntel also released a statement acknowledging the two met and saying they had \"a candid and constructive discussion on Intel\u2019s commitment to strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\"\nIntel stock pared gains after the market open. Shares rose 3.5% on Monday during the day as reports circulated about the meeting.\nCiting unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Tan was set to meet with Trump on Monday to explain his personal and professional background and to propose ways that Intel and the government can collaborate.\nLast week, Trump called for Tan's resignation in a Truth Social post minutes after Fox Business covered Republican Sen. Tom Cotton's recent criticism of the CEO over his ties with China. In a letter to Intel, Cotton expressed \"concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations,\" given Tan\u2019s investments in Chinese businesses through his venture capital firm, Walden International.\nTrump wrote in his post last Thursday, \"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.\u201d\nTan responded by saying reports about his career contained \"misinformation.\"\n\"There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles ... I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I\u2019ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem \u2014 and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,\" Tan wrote in a memo to employees.\nIntel also issued its own statement following Trump's comments, emphasizing its commitment to \"advancing US national and economic security interests\" and to making investments \"aligned with the President's America First agenda,\" including domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\nTan was named Intel's CEO in March, taking over after his predecessor Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the board last year. The company struggled to stem losses in its manufacturing business, regain market share in its legacy computer chip segment, and develop an AI strategy."

It seems clear that insiders felt that stock prices (at all-time highs) were vulnerable to renewed volatility based on newsflow that includes earnings reports, tariff confusion, interest-rate drama, and (now) concerns about the employment situation. With the VIX popping 22% last Friday and then falling 13% on Monday, we'll say they got the volatility part right. Meanwhile, the S&P 500% hasn't done much over the past month and is off about 1% in the past week -- not a great performance report. Vickers broadest measure of insider sentiment, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio, has fallen for eight consecutive weeks and is near an outright bearish reading. On an exchange basis, the NYSE eight-week ratio has fallen for 11 weeks and is already bearish, while the Nasdaq ratio has plateaued after eight weeks of deterioration and has managed (just barely) to stay neutral. Insider buying drove activity in the Energy sector over the past week, with shares valued at $1.2 million bought versus none sold. It was the only sector in which buying outpaced selling. Still, buying activity just barely lagged selling in Consumer Discretionary.

      "text": "In this article:\nIntel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan responded to President Trump's public call for his resignation late Thursday, calling reports about his career \"misinformation.\" In a letter to staff, he said the company was engaging with the Trump administration.\n\"There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles ... I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I\u2019ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem \u2014 and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,\" Tan wrote.\nEarly Thursday, President Trump wrote on Truth Social, the social media platform he owns, \"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.\"\n\"There is no other solution to this problem,\" he continued. \"Thank you for your attention to this problem!\"\nTan was named Intel's CEO back in March, taking over from Pat Gelsinger's tumultuous tenure that saw the company's stock plummet and the chipmaker fall behind in the AI race. Investors cheered Tan's appointment, with the stock rising as much as 15% after the news, and Wall Street analysts, as well as current and former executives and employees, saw Tan as the best possibility to succeed in turning around the troubled company.\nIntel stock rose Friday after losing over 3% Thursday in the aftermath of Trump's post.\nIntel issued a statement following Trump's comments, emphasizing its commitment to \"advancing US national and economic security interests\" and to making investments \"aligned with the President's America First agenda,\" including domestic semiconductor manufacturing. \"We look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\" the statement concludes.\nIn April, a Reuters report detailed Tan's wide-ranging investments in Chinese companies made through his VC firm, Walden International. The outlet found that the firm \"remains invested in 20 funds and companies alongside Chinese government funds or state-owned enterprises, according to Chinese corporate databases.\"\nTan has served on boards and in various executive roles at 14 firms in the semiconductor space, most notably including his tenure as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a chip design software company.\nTrump's post came a day after one of his top Senate allies, Republican Tom Cotton, wrote a letter to Intel's board chair questioning Tan's China ties.\n\"Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\" Cotton wrote, pointing to Intel's nearly $8 billion grant from the CHIPS Act. \"Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.\""
