      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but still feels like a collection of facts rather than a coherent, actionable investment thesis. To reach world‑class quality, tighten the narrative around a 3–6 month horizon by building a **scenario/catalyst map**: list the macro drivers (e.g., UAS regulatory tightening, tariff shifts, Pfizer’s patent cliff, Toyota’s hybrid‑only RAV4 launch) and the specific triggers (e.g., new FAA certification, tariff announcement, Eliquis LOE, 2026 RAV4 hybrid‑only rollout). For each trigger, add a clear **invalidation point** (e.g., if FAA delays certification, UAS growth stalls; if tariffs are rolled back, Abbott’s margin risk lessens). Quantify every claim—use the 97 % UAS job growth from FOM34PUWA, the $105,912 average salary, Abbott’s 53‑year dividend streak, AbbVie’s $18.2 B free cash flow, Pfizer’s 6.7 % yield and 8 % LOE window, and Toyota’s 239,451 RAV4 units (111,526 hybrids, 17,074 PHEVs) from H8880U45S. Anchor each figure with a citation (e.g., “(FOM34PUWA)”). Structure the analysis in a **base case + 1–2 alternatives** (e.g., “UAS boom” vs. “UAS slowdown”) and end with a **confidence rating** and a watch‑list of signals (e.g., UAS policy changes, tariff announcements, patent expirations). Ensure every critical source is referenced and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., differing UAS job counts) by explicitly noting the source bias. This will transform the draft from a list of observations into a rigorous, data‑driven investment narrative.",
