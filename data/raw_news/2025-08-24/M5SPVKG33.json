  "title": "This Hurricane Season I'm Using 7 iPhone Weather Apps to Protect My Family",
  "description": "As storm season intensifies, are you prepared?",
  "content": "Between now and the end of November, many residents in the Southeast United States are focused on one concern: the potential for hurricanes. The beginning of hurricane season creates significant stress and uncertainty for everyone. People in coastal and inland regions begin preparing for potential effects when tropical storms and hurricanes intensify as they pass over warm ocean waters.\n\nBeing prepared for a terrible storm, however, goes beyond boarding up your home and keeping a ready supply of essentials on hand. You also have to have digital tools in your pocket.\n\nSeveral worthwhile iPhone weather apps in the App Store offer vital safety information, including real-time storm tracking and essential emergency resources, before, during, and after a storm. These apps offer distinct features that cater to different user requirements, ranging from basic safety alerts for everyday users to detailed meteorological data for enthusiasts.\n\nThese iPhone apps, some of which you may not be familiar with, offer a robust set of tools that people in hurricane-prone areas can use individually or in combination. These apps can help you make informed choices as you navigate the storm.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane Center (NHC) is the U.S. government agency responsible for tracking one of the most dangerous types of storms that Mother Nature can throw at us. It makes sense that one of the best iPhone apps conveying this information utilizes the National Hurricane Center\u2019s name and resources, as there\u2019s no official app from the agency.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center app is dedicated to posting the latest forecast and storm-specific graphics that you will need to protect your family. These include familiar spaghetti models that are effective at showing possible paths to specific storms, as well as cone track forecasts. It also provides government reports, including tropical weather outlooks, forecast advisories, warnings, and other relevant information.\n\nThis app is a must-have for anyone tracking dangerous storms. The free version provides the necessary tools to identify emerging threats in your area and offers recommendations on how to address them. With a pro subscription, you can access more information, including full-screen, high-resolution satellite imagery, 16-day weather forecast models, weather simulation tools, and much more.\n\nIn an emergency, you can count on the Red Cross. The free Emergency app from the organization is designed to help you prepare for and respond to different types of disasters and severe weather events. Because of its nature, among all the apps listed, this is one of the most important to have available at any time of year.\n\nWith the Emergency app, you can set up and receive over 40 customizable weather alerts from NOAA. You can set alerts for your current location and up to eight others. Among the many alerts are those for events such as floods, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hurricanes, and numerous other natural disasters.\n\nWhen you aren\u2019t necessarily tracking an active storm, you can also check out the app\u2019s long list of preparedness guides. These can help you prepare for various possible hazards such as earthquakes, home fires, and others.\n\nThe Emergency app also includes a shelter locator for times of emergency, as well as an \u201cI\u2019m Safe\u201d tool, so you can let family and friends know you are okay when you\u2019re located in an area with an active storm.\n\nLike many apps, My Hurricane Tracker pulls official data and graphical products from the NHC. However, it also includes interactive features that are second to none, as well as a historical storm data feature that tracks historic storms dating back to the mid-19th century.\n\nPerhaps My Hurricane Tracker\u2019s best feature is how it makes it simple to access data on various storms around the world. The storms are positioned one after the other, and all you have to do is click on them for more information. A similar tool details currently reported tornadoes.\n\nThis app is free, but you can remove its ads with an in-app purchase. I don\u2019t find the ads invasive, but others might, so it\u2019s nice that the app developer offers this option.\n\nHere\u2019s another popular weather-related app that tracks all sorts of storms and weather-related instances, not just hurricanes. My Radar's primary function shows animated, live radar around your current location. You can also look at weather loops of up to two hours, so you can see what\u2019s heading your way.\n\nMy favorite part about My Radar is its advanced rain feature. This is designed to send you alerts up to an hour in advance of an appropriate storm. The alerts provide essential details, such as the likely time the storm will hit, its intensity, and duration. The My Radar app also offers customizable layers, allowing you to drill down to key data, including temperatures, clouds, alerts, hurricane and tropical storm tracking, wildfire detection, and animated wind maps. There\u2019s also a video section where you can watch media on hurricanes, storms, new tropical disturbances, and more.\n\nMy Radar is free, but it does offer a premium upgrade. With this, you can remove ads and gain additional features, such as a more in-depth hurricane tracker, historical radar, the ability to add a localized per-station radar, and more. It\u2019s a good upgrade, but you don\u2019t need to purchase it to get accurate storm reporting in real-time.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to live in areas where hurricanes are prevalent to appreciate Rain Viewer. The app offers highly detailed radar data and short-term rain predictions. Featuring a fresh, modern interface, the app is one of my go-to favorites during the spring and summer, when thunderstorms often occur in the Northeast U.S.\n\nDuring hurricanes, Rain Viewer goes into overdrive by offering live maps of precipitation and a two-hour, highly accurate forecast that\u2019s updated every five minutes. This short-term focus provides a unique experience, distinct from other weather apps.\n\nRain Viewer is available as a free download, but it\u2019s even better with a pro membership. This upgrade unlocks two additional overlays, Storm Tracks and Arrows. In doing so, it shows real-time tropical cyclone paths and the paths they are likely to take. Rain Viewer PRO also allows you to add up to 20 locations; the free version is limited to your current location and one additional location. The paid version also offers a 48-hour map archive, which is a nice addition for weather enthusiasts.\n\nAnother excellent app for up-to-the-minute weather information is Clime. Its top feature is its thorough, customizable radar map that lets you adjust the look of radar images and choose different background maps to match your preferences. Like some other apps on this list, Clime offers ad-based free and premium versions. The latter adds several essential features for those who need to track hurricanes and tropical storms.\n\nAmong the premium features are the ability to track specific storms, unlocking a real-time lightning tracker, and extended-range forecasts. Specialized maps are also included with the paid version.\n\nMuch of Clime\u2019s content is pulled from NOAA, so it\u2019s up to you to decide which app to choose to get similar information. I often turn to Clime when I\u2019m traveling to a location where storms are approaching, and during those times, I subscribe to the premium version for the short term. Otherwise, I continue to find value in the free version even with the ads.\n\nThe Weather Channel\u2019s Storm Radar app is another download worth considering. It offers live, high-resolution real-time Doppler radar maps and future radar that projects storm movement and precipitation over the coming hours. It also includes a potentially life-saving severe weather alert feature.\n\nThis app\u2019s biggest selling point is its advanced weather visualization that offers a more granular and customizable experience than some other apps. That customization enables the addition and combination of numerous data layers on a single map, which is highly valuable during storms.\n\nMuch of what makes Storm Radar successful is included in the free version. A premium update includes extras such as a six-hour future radar, storm tracker, hail zone information, ad removal, and more. If you typically watch The Weather Channel to get your weather-related news, this is the app for you.\n\nThere are lots of weather apps available for your iPhone. However, only a handful of these do a great job during intense storms, such as hurricanes. You don\u2019t need every app on this list, but a combination of a few is worth considering when you\u2019re in the path of a terrible storm. Try out the free versions and select the ones that best suit you and your situation.",

That's where Rainviewer has been a lifesaver. Its rain notifications are spot-on, giving m a heads-up before those sudden downpours hit. Whether it's planning a park day or a school run, feel more prepared. The app is super user-friendly - even in the middle of hectic mornings, I can quickly check it. The real-time radar is a bonus, especially for explaining to my curious kids why we might need to switch plans. Overall, RainViewer help me making my life a bit easier. I absolutely recommend it to any parent dealing with weather quirks!\nDeveloper Response ,\nJane, we're thrilled to hear our app meets your expectations! Stay tuned for more features and improvements \ud83d\udc99\nAds are overwhelmingly\nI understand the need and use for ads in applications that are free. However, this application takes it to an all new level. I have never in my life, viewed a radar and been interrupted in the middle of watching a radar animation to have an ad pop-up what's worse is they use the kind of ads used by other applications, like words with friends that make you watch a video.\nthis shows the immaturity of the marketing and development people involved with this app who think that the more ads they throw at you the more it'll motivate you to purchase the ad free version. Problem is the opposite is true better just to leave the ads out altogether, and have the merits of premium featureswarrant and encourage someone to upgrade. This is no better than Clickbait articles that are full of advertisements and pop-ups. There are too many excellent weather applications available today. Maybe they should take some time and learn from those apps.\nDeveloper Response ,\nHi. Thanks a lot for trying our app. It's a shame to hear you're not satisfied with our free app version. It is true that ad blocks are implemented there. Our marketing team frequently analyzes ad behavior trying to make it less annoying yet effective, though. Probably you'll find it useful to try our premium version someday. We have several promo campaigns with discounted prices throughout the year (please follow our social media for announcements). Respectfully\nThe most accurate weather.\nI was a dark sky user for years, and when it was bought by apple I was hopefully their weather app would be as good as the original. It wasn\u2019t. I tried out roughly 7 different weather apps comparing them to the actual weather outside and this has been the single most accurate app I have used down to the minute. Every other app but this one failed to change its predictions and would tell me it was raining when it clearly was not. This should be everyone\u2019s default for weather.\nDeveloper Response ,\nWhat a pleasure to receive positive comments from you, thanks! Our clients are real superstars for us and we work hard to improve the RainViewer each day making it even better \ud83e\udd0d\nSubscriptions\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, MeteoLab Inc., indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

It is now easier to add the locations that matter most to you. Alerts now display more detailed information from the U.S. National Weather Service.\nRatings and Reviews\nLoving the update\nI love the newest features of having emergency plans and checklists within the app itself! Personally I have been using this app for the past couple of years to receive alerts, for my area as well as for friends and family, and then be able to forward those alerts to them. I love how how you can also have your preparedness plans and checklists on the app itself! Also love the learning modules! Highly recommend as I\u2019m extremely happy with the app\u2019s performance and especially with the newest features!\nAbsolute trash\nThis is making me incredibly frustrated. This is two times within a week that i have been in a tornado warning location with not a single warning from this app\u2026 on anyone\u2019s phone! The tornado warning a week ago actually produced a tornado on the ground and without someone watching the news randomly at my daughters dance class no one would have known! Tonight thank God my husband was watching the news and there was a tornado warning for our location 30 minutes before your measly little warning came out. If i hadn\u2019t of already been awake i would not have even heard that little notification. It sounded the exact same as the notification for a thunderstorm warning! What happened to the blaring siren y\u2019all used to put out with the guy saying \u201ctornado warning\u201d with it?! Fix your issues\u2026 if you\u2019re supposed to be an emergency notification app maybe it would be important to announce those emergencies properly.\nGreat App\nI absolutely love this app. We\u2019ve had a bit of weird weather lately that requires seeking shelter, and while I hate the feeling I get from the loud alarm sound from a tornado warning on here, it is 100% appreciated because it could wake me from a dead sleep in time to get kids and pets to safety. The radius recommendations are perfect. The thought process behind the features on this app are comforting and appropriate. I recommend this app for all my family and friends.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, American Red Cross, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

From free to feature-rich to futuristic, we have some great recommendations to share.\nHow We Picked the Best Weather Apps for iPhone\nBest anything is always a subjective call, and in the case of the best weather apps for iOS, what makes one app a must-have download and turns you into a lifelong fan may not even be on the radar for another person.\nFor some people, that must-have feature might be an elegant or novel interface, a really polished weather radar, pollen or air quality alerts, or any number of things relevant to their health, hobbies, or job.\nSomeone else might consider the privacy policy of their weather app, where the weather data comes from, or whether or not they can add a customized weather widget to their iPhone's lock screen the most important thing.\nSo in our descriptions below, we've aimed to highlight some key details about each app to save you from the hassle of downloading and testing them all out---though you might want grab the two that look the most appealing to give them a real-world test drive.\nBest Free Weather App: Apple Weather\nHistorically, you wouldn't find Apple Weather at the top of any best iOS weather app lists. Like many stock Apple apps, it was there, it was OK, but it wasn't anything particularly exceptional.\nThe time in the doldrums ended for the Weather app when Apple acquired Dark Sky, a wildly popular weather app and service, and used the acquisition to improve Apple Weather and create the WeatherKit API.\nToday Apple Weather is significantly more sophisticated than it was years ago. So if you tried it back when you first started using an iPhone and swore off it, it's worth giving it a second look. The interface has more options, the weather data is more accurate, and many features you'd only find on premium third-party apps, like weather animations and hyper-local reporting, are now integrated into the app.\nAs far as recommendations go, we know recommending a stock iOS app as a best weather app candidate isn't super sexy. But unless you uninstalled it, the app is already on your iPhone, has simple but polished weather widgets for both your home screen and lock screen, and is great for casual use.\nIs it infinitely configurable and customizable? No. Is it free while covering all the basics like alerts, forecasting, air quality, and other expected weather app functions? Absolutely.\nBest Weather App: Carrot Weather\nIf you've asked your friends what weather app they use or looked into weather apps for your iPhone at all, you're bound to have come across Carrot Weather.\nOn the surface, Carrot Weather is a colorful and fun weather application with a simple art style. While distinctive, the art style is hardly the thing that stands out the most to people. Carrot Weather's most distinctive trait is the ability to tweak the \"personality\" of the app to anything from a very professional and impartial weather reporter to a snarky anarchist and anything in between. That might sound ridiculous, and it's fine if a weather app with a chatty off-cuff personality isn't for you, but it's garnered Carrot Weather a cult following.\nWitty remarks about the weather are hardly enough to sell a weather app, though, so thankfully, Carrot Weather is also an extremely customizable app that offers a dizzying array of options for you to rearrange how weather data is displayed in the app and on the home screen and lock screen widgets.\nAfter Apple's acquisition of Dark Sky and the shuttering of the Dark Sky app, many Dark Sky users flocked to Carrot Weather to recreate the Dark Sky experience with a familiar interface---Dark Sky fans should check out the \"Inline\" layout option---and premium features like the weather time machine to look back at the weather.\nJust like we suggested you not write off Apple Weather because it used to be a very lackluster app, we'd also encourage you not to write off Carrot Weather because you've heard it's a snarky weather app. The snark part is optional, and the app and widgets are highly customizable.\nCarrot Weather has a free version as well as three subscription tiers. The Premium tier, which is the best upgrade for most folks, is $4.99/month or $19.99/year. The upgrade unlocks notifications, customizations, widgets, and Apple Watch complications.\nThe Premium Ultra tier costs $9.99/month or $39.99/year. It includes the Premium tier features plus additional features like rain, lightning, and storm cell notifications, a weather map widget, and quick-switching for weather data sources.\nAnd if you happen to have a whole family of weather nerds, the best value is Premium Family, $14.99/month or $59.99/year, which gives you and five family members the Ultra tier (via Apple's Family Sharing).\nBest Weather App for Notifications: Weather Underground\nLong before other apps were talking about hyper-local weather (or, for that matter, long before there were even mobile apps, period), there was Weather Underground. Founded in 1995, the company has long specialized in very hyper-local weather reporting by aggregating data from the National Weather Service with data from over 250,000 personal weather stations.\nOne of the highlights of the Weather Underground app is the detailed weather map with multiple detailed overlays and the ability to easily drill down to specific data on different reporting zones in your area. It's also notable that Weather Underground doesn't paywall alerts or advanced weather data.\nIt's also nice that there are two upgrade tiers. If you like the app as it is but would prefer no ads, you can remove ads for only $1.99 a year. They also have a Premium tier ($3.99/month or $19.99 a year) that removes the ads, extends the extended forecast from 10 to 15 days, and unlocks Smart Forecasts.\nThe Smart Forecasts feature lets you set parameters for the weather and then get automatic notifications based on the conditions. Need a clear windy day to fly a kite or go sailing? A day with an optimal temperature range and low humidity for a hike? Smart Forecasts can alert you that the conditions are perfect for your pursuits.\nHowever, there is one missing feature that may be a deal breaker for some people. Unlike most of the apps in our roundup, Weather Underground doesn't have home screen or lock screen widgets (in either the free or paid versions of the app).\nBest Plain-English Weather App: Hello Weather\nThere are a lot of weather apps out there, and so many of them look like you're accessing a decades-old web page, banner ads, and all, repackaged into an app. Hello Weather was created by a small team to get away from that kludgy and cluttered interface feeling and present weather data in a clean and easy-to-understand format.\nIt's one thing to know what the humidity and dew point are, for example, but what does that actually mean for you and whether or not you go for a long walk? Is it comfortable? What about changes in barometric pressure? Hello Weather integrates that kind of information in plain English into the forecast data and widgets.\nThe app is ad-free and free to use, with a plain-English privacy policy that makes it clear there is no personal data collected or shared. The free version includes basic customization, a radar, and home screen and lock screen widgets. Upgrading to the premium tier ($1.99/month or $14.99/year) unlocks Apple Watch complications (which are quite sharp looking), additional data sources, and a slew of customization options.\nBest Non-traditional Weather App: (Not Boring) Weather\nIf you're really into charts, tables, radar imagery, and the usual trappings of popular weather apps, (Not Boring) Weather probably isn't for you.\nOn the other hand, if you've ever wished for a really slick weather app that feels like a slick iOS-only mobile game in the running for game of the year, then the (Not Boring) Weather app might just be for you.\nThe app throws traditional weather app design right out the window in favor of turning the interface into a sort of interactive weather fidget toy. The animated weather model and the large temperature readout are 3D modeled and interactive.\nYou can rotate and flip them about if you're so inclined, tap on the model for additional information, or swipe through the interface at the bottom of the screen for forecast data. And if you slide your finger along the weather bar at the bottom, it'll \"play\" the forecast for the day like you're scrubbing through a 3D animation of the weather conditions.\nIt's definitely not for everyone, and if you crave a weather-app-as-command-center experience, you'll want to look elsewhere. But it's a really fun and fresh take on the weather app category. The app will run you $14.99 a year, but that includes the weather app as well as the (Not Boring) take on Habits, Calculator, and Timer to expand the 3D-game-looking good vibes to other apps you use on your iPhone, too."

      "text": "I love trying out new apps on my iPhone, especially those that make my life easier through new features, sleek interfaces, and raw utility. Along the way, I've picked up some niche apps along the way that have become a staple in my app library (and a bane to my screen time).\nThese are a few of my more interesting discoveries that I'd previously never heard of (and never knew I needed).\nSequel\nSequel is a one-stop app to keep track of your media consumption across a range of different platforms. You can take note of movies, shows, games, books, and audiobooks that you want to get into by creating a comprehensive wishlist and collection. The app allows you to check off media as you consume, along with options to check off individual episodes and seasons for shows. By allocating media to collections, you can also easily get into new genres, languages, and tropes across everything you consume.\nWhat I like about Sequel, apart from its clean interface, is that you can sync the app to Trakt-enabled apps and devices, so you can sync data automatically from services like Netflix, Apple TV+, Hulu, and other streaming services. This helps you skip the hassle of manually adding shows and movies.\nYou can also unlock features like Magic Lookup (web search), release reminders, personal notes, and where to watch using a Sequel+ subscription ($19.99/year).\nJustWatch\nJustWatch complements Sequel perfectly, especially if you're not convinced to sign up for a subscription for one of its fundamental features. This streaming guide solves the frustration of being unable to find where a movie or show is streaming while giving you some top-notch recommendations on streaming platforms you're interested in. Details of a movie or show include the best price for the subscription, if you can watch it for free (including free trial options), episodes, and seasons.\nJustWatch also allows you to create wish lists for movies and shows, while constantly being updated with new releases and recommendations. The app also has a sports tab if you're into live sports, but don't know where to watch upcoming games.\nWeb Roulette!\nWeb Roulette! does exactly what it says: every time you open this app and shake your phone, you spin a virtual roulette wheel that lands you on a random web page. Past results I've seen include a YouTube video about happiness, informative news articles, fun web games, and goofy comics. It's a bit of a deep cut for web veterans who remember services like StumbleUpon.\nWeb Roulette! is a good time killer, especially when you're tired of doomscrolling on your favorite apps and just want your phone to do the work for you by giving you something new to read or watch. The app has categories (like pop culture, gaming, tech, shopping, sports, and more), which you can customize to delete or add web pages and sites that you want to see more random pulls from. You can save and share every random roulette you receive.\nThe best part about Web Roulette! is that it's completely free to use and ad-free (not including the ads you might come across on the random web pages you see). I like to use this app to save and bookmark my favorite websites and pages that I never get around to viewing, so that I can randomly shake my phone and will myself to finally give it a read or watch.\nMusicBox\nYou can find plenty of apps that let you bookmark books, shows, and movies to revisit later, but it's not every day you come across a bookmark app to save your music. MusicBox is a simple-to-use free app that helps you bookmark, tag, and categorize music you want to visit later. The app has features like Smart Search, Import from Playlist, Add with Shazam, and Add from Other Apps (like Apple Music) to help you skip manually adding albums and singles.\nYou can also make changes to metadata, add notes, and read editorials for music that you've saved. The app supports iCloud sync and is easy to use across your Apple devices. Once you save music, you can tap on the album cover to start listening to it on Apple Music. There are many ways to customize your saved music (tags, lists, ratings, and so on), so you can go crazy about organizing your music bookmarks the way you want. MusicBox is especially useful if you're into collecting physical media and want to keep track of albums, vinyl, or CDs you want to purchase.\nWith a premium subscription ($1.99/month or $14.99/year), you can catalog and organize unlimited albums, songs, radio stations, and playlists.\nLibby\nIf you have a library card (or are planning to get one), then Libby is a must-have free app to download on your iPhone. This app lets you access ebooks and audiobooks for free as long as your local library is registered. Once you find a title you like, you can borrow it for 14 days (with loan and hold options) for free. What's fun about Libby is its virtual library features, including your bookshelf, wish list, bookmarks, custom page view, and tags to organize your collection.\nLibby is an amazing resource to start using if you want to take full advantage of your library card, especially if you don't frequent the library as much as you'd like to. You can even add multiple library cards to access titles across different libraries.\nMagic ToDo\nMagic ToDo is a productivity manager to help you simplify tasks so you don't get overwhelmed easily. This productivity tool breaks down your tasks for the day into smaller sub-tasks so you can check off steps as you complete them. By splitting tasks and adding an expiration date, you can focus better on taking things step-by-step while keeping track of your progress.\nMagic ToDo is fun to use, with an intuitive interface that just clicked for me right off the bat. As you go about your tasks, you earn points that help you upgrade your virtual magic island over time. As a big fan of using a Pomodoro timer to time my work and focus sessions, I enjoy using the app's built-in focus timer that is fully customizable. You can then track your focus time and get insights into your productivity as tasks are checked off.\nYuka\nWhether you're starting a diet, want to become more health-conscious, or are concerned about what you eat and use, Yuka is a free scanner that can be of use to you. The independent app allows you to scan the barcodes of food and cosmetics, and see how they impact your health. This includes nutrient breakdown (highlighting negatives and positives of that item) for food and ingredient breakdown (highlighting risk levels) for cosmetics. You can get insight into the additives in your food, and any high-risk ingredients you may be allergic to in cosmetics.\nYuka also gives you recommendations based on items you scan and insights into your purchases. With a premium membership (between $10 and $20 a year), you can search for food items and cosmetics in the app.\nRise\nRise is a unique sleep debt tracker to help you track your sleep patterns and energy levels. While you can also use the Apple Health app to track your rest, Rise uses \"Sleep Debt\" to help you fix your sleep schedule. This is calculated using your sleep history, stress levels, activity, and other factors. You can also find out about your melatonin window (for taking supplements), when to take power naps, and when you have the most energy throughout the day.\nYou can connect Rise to Apple Health (as well as Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura, and other sleep-tracking apps), so your sleep is tracked more accurately. The app also calculates your wake window so you can plan your sleep schedule according to what works best for your body. Beyond helping you get more insights into your sleep patterns to reduce your sleep debt, Rise is very helpful to know when your energy levels peak, so it's easier to plan your day (and productive work sessions) around those times.\nHow I Use Sleep Tracking and My Smart Home to Improve My Sleep\nTech can measure your sleep quality and help improve it\nRise also offers sleep aids like calming music, sleep techniques, and a sleep quality monitor, with tools to help you manage your caffeine and alcohol consumption, meals, and workouts. The app has a premium subscription model ($69.99/year) for access to app content, with a seven-day free trial option.\nRadio Garden\nOne of the most interesting music apps I've come across so far is Radio Garden. This is a global radio randomizer that lets you navigate the globe with a 3D map and click on random cities so you can tune into the local radio station of that location. Radio Garden plants \"seeds\" when you first set up the app so you can navigate the map and click on a random green dot and view all available local stations. You can also save your favorite radio stations and browse for new stations based on different moods (like musical roots, rare tongues, and fringe cities).\nRadio Garden lets you view popular radio stations from different countries, so you can quickly tune in. I like to use this app to discover new, sometimes niche music from other countries that would usually fly under my streaming radar. It's also a good complementary app to help you with learning a new language. With a Radio Garden premium subscription ($2.99/month or $24.99/year), you can use Sleep Timer, Family Sharing, and remove the ads.\nCheapCharts\nIf you're looking to find the best deals for movies and shows on streaming platforms, specifically Apple's store, then CheapCharts is a good free app to download. The app shows you ongoing deals for titles on iTunes, Google Play, Prime Video, and Vudu, as well as for games on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch. You can also see details about the best deal for that title, how much more or less you'd be paying at the current price, and ratings.\nCheapCharts also shows deals on music (albums), audiobooks, books, and apps (some of which you can only view on the web app). You can add titles to your wish list or mark them as purchased, and turn on notifications to be alerted on upcoming deals and price drops.\nIf you want to find unique apps for your niche interests and needs, exploring app categories in the App Store can be a good place to start. You can also find new, trending apps under the \"Today\" section in your App Store."

      "text": "Summary\n- To use Check In, open a Messages conversation for the contact you want to use it with, tap the \"+\" icon, then scroll down and choose \"Check In.\"\n- Select how much data you want to share before hitting \"Continue.\" Once your trip is over, your contact will be notified you arrived safely.\n- Check In only works when both devices are running iOS 17.0 or later.\nLet friends and family know when you\u2019ve arrived safely with Check In, a feature that\u2019s designed to replace those \u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d texts you might forget to send. Here\u2019s what it does and how to use it.\nHow Check In Works\nCheck In was introduced in the iOS 17 update for iPhone, which, at the time of writing, is currently in public beta and due for release later in September 2023. You won\u2019t be able to use the feature (and nor will your contacts) until both devices are running iOS 17.0 or later.\nThe feature is designed to make it easy to keep contacts informed while you\u2019re in transit. Anyone you share with will be notified when you arrive safely at your destination, so you don\u2019t need to notify them manually.\nIt\u2019s also a safeguard in case something does happen. If you fail to arrive at your destination or if you place an emergency call, you\u2019ll be prompted to extend your Check In. If you fail to answer or your device goes offline for \u201can extended period\u201d then select information will be shared with your contact after 15 minutes of inactivity.\nHow to Use Check In on iPhone\nYou can initiate a Check In using the Messages app with anyone else who has an iPhone and is running iOS 17.0 or later. To do this, open a conversation and tap on the plus \u201c+\u201d button.\nScroll down (or tap More) and choose Check In from the list of options. If this is your first time using the feature you\u2019ll be treated to an explainer. Tap \u201cContinue\u201d and you\u2019ll eventually see a menu asking you to choose how much data is shared with your contacts in the event of you not arriving safely.\nPicking \u201cLimited\u201d will share only your current location and details about battery life and network signal for your iPhone and Apple Watch. If you choose to share \u201cFull\u201d you\u2019ll share this information plus the route you traveled, the last location of your iPhone, and the last location of your Apple Watch when it was removed.\nOnce you\u2019ve decided, hit \u201cContinue\u201d to see a final summary of what Check In covers and how it works. When you proceed, your Check In box will appear in the message window.\nTap on \u201cDetails\u201d to customize your Check In including selecting a destination or a timer. When you\u2019re happy, hit \u201cDone\u201d and send your Check In as you would a normal message. Once you arrive at your destination, you don\u2019t need to do anything; your Check In will simply end, and the other party will be notified that you arrived safely.\nShare Your Location Too\nCheck In doesn\u2019t share your route or location until you fail to arrive (and after the 15-minute timer is up). It\u2019s not a replacement for sharing your location with someone using Find My or Google Maps.\nIt\u2019s good to keep in mind that your iPhone lets you revoke all sorts of permissions including location sharing using the Safety Check feature."

One aspect that bugs me, however, is when bringing up the radar map, it defaults to the beginning of the loop, which is sometimes 30 minutes old. I would prefer it to default to the \u201cnow\u201d position - that is what I am most interested in when opening the app. Also, I found the temperature for my area to be off by about 6 degrees compared to my outside temperature gauge and my other weather apps. It is nice that I can submit a change, but I would prefer for it to be a little more accurate without having to tweak it.\nAdditional Comments: At the suggestion of the author, I tried the advanced precipitation layer and I found that I liked it very much. It opens at the \u201cnow\u201d point. Still would like to see the radar open at the now point too, though.\nOne other feedback comment: With the icon indicating a chance for rain in the hourly summary, it is very hard to actually see the rain. The rain drops should be made to be more obvious. One should not have to look hard and squint to see if there is rain falling from the dark cloud or not.\nDeveloper Response ,\nHello! Thank you very much for your feedback for reaching out.\nThe Advanced and Basic Precipitation Forecast overlays provide weather data for the upcoming hours. If you want to change an overlay, please go to the Weather Maps section of the app and choose the required option.\nWe appreciate your comment on redesigning the precipitation icon and will consider it while working on future versions of the app. If you have any further suggestions or ideas please let us know at any time.\nAs to the issue with the incorrect weather data for your location, please tell us the details via our email address support@weatherornotapps.com. Your input will definitely help us improve our app for you and everybody else.\nThank you in advance! Best regards, Support Team\nUnique Outstanding Design App!\nOnce in a while you get lucky and find an App that really is something special and that is really hard to do. There are many Developers out there with all kind of ideas but not all of them are amazingly great! But the Developers of this Unique Outstanding Design App don\u2019t fall into that category! I am an old Man who likes to take Walks if I can. I say this because my Health now Days is not Great and I find myself Fighting Cancer. So this App tells me when the weather is such or good that I might be able to attempt that walk. The Unique App for me and my location has always been amazingly accurate and I am grateful for that. The app cost Money but Technology is not free and I have found though all my years that anything that is good and you want to keep has never been free!! I hope if you have taken the opportunity of your busy schedule to Read this you will Download this 5 Star \u2b50\ufe0f app and truly give it a try. I don\u2019t believe you will be Sorry. ( really ) so with that it\u2019s Time for this ole man to pick up His Cane \ud83e\uddaf and move on so they say, but I want to Thank the Developer or Developers for putting all the Hard Work Time Love and ya Sweat into the Coding of this Unique Software. I Truly Tip my Hat \ud83c\udfa9 to you that you have truly created a 5 Star \u2b50\ufe0f App! Thanks\nUsed to be good, now its not.\nBefore they got sooo pushy on their subscription, it used to be a very good weather app. First they took away rainscope and air quality and other stuff like that, I didn't really care at first. Next they took away really good features like the 1 hour interval, and to get it back, you have to pay their stupid subscription. Honestly, I was starting to get sick! And the subscription was just too much for a simple weather app that is supposed to keep you safe. But now, I guess the owner of this app is so interested in money that he is cutting important features and making people subscribe to their subscription. Honestly, sometimes its not even that accurate! One time it was supposed to rain and it said I was in the middle of it and it was just a simple dark cloudy sky and it wasn't even raining yet, and not until 46 minutes later of this forecast! I would rate this app 5 stars before they started getting pushy on their subscription! But now, I would rate it 0 stars. I just rated it five stars so it would show up on the comments section on the app store. If you don't want to basically pay for an app for very important features, then this app is not for you. I hope they better this app, because they just lost a user here.\nDeveloper Response ,\nHello! Thank you very much for your review. There's always room for improvement, and we would appreciate your kind contribution. If there is anything that we could do to improve your experience with the app or add some features to the basic app version, please let us know at support@weatherornotapps.com.
