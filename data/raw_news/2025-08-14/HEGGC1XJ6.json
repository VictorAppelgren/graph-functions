Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements made in this report regarding the merger, including the benefits of the merger, revenue opportunities, anticipated future financial and operating performance, and results, including estimates for growth. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on management\u2019s current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions.

Important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: (a) the occurrence of any event, change, or other circumstances relating to the combined company; (b) failure to obtain the necessary consents and approvals; (c) the risk that the merger disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the merger; (e) costs related to the merger; and (f) changes in applicable laws or regulations. Vyome cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Vyome cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Vyome does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable law.",
