  "content": "Police tape surrounds the Owl Bar in Anaconda, Mont., Aug. 1 following the fatal shooting.\n\nA man suspected in a shooting at a Montana bar that left four people dead and prompted a neighborhood lockdown was captured Friday after a weeklong search, authorities said.\n\nMichael Paul Brown, 45, was taken into custody around 2 p.m. near the area where authorities had focused their search in the days following the Aug. 1 shooting at the Owl Bar in Anaconda, about a hundred miles from Missoula. Authorities said only that Brown had been placed under arrest, without providing more details about where he was found.\n\nGov. Greg Gianforte confirmed Brown\u2019s capture on social media, saying it was an incredible response from law enforcement officers across the state.\n\n\u201cMay God continue to be with the families of the four victims still grieving their loss,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthorities planned to release more details about Brown\u2019s capture during a news conference Friday evening.\n\nMontana authorities have not said what sparked last week\u2019s shooting, which killed a female bartender and three male patrons. They were identified as Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64; Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59; David Allen Leach, 70; and Tony Wayne Palm, 74.\n\nThe shooting rattled the tight-knit town of about 9,000 people, and many residents were on high alert as authorities searched wooded hillsides from the ground and air. About 22 square miles of forest southwest of Anaconda had been closed to the public by forest managers as a precaution.\n\nEarlier in the week, Montana Atty. Gen. Austin Knudsen had said it didn\u2019t appear that Brown had broken into any cabins or homes in the area to get food or additional supplies.\n\nBrown, who lived next door to the Owl Bar, served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005. He also was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to 2009.\n\nBrown\u2019s niece, Clare Boyle, said her uncle has struggled with mental illness for years and she and other family members repeatedly sought help.\n\nSchoenbaum writes for the Associated Press.",

Her daughter was discovered in the passenger seat of a car crashed nearby, also bleeding from gunshot wounds, according to the Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nDeputies and Compton Fire Department personnel attempted to render lifesaving aid, but both victims were both pronounced dead at the scene.\nInvestigators later learned that Brown drove up to the victims\u2019 car while it was stopped at a light on Caldwell Street and unleashed several rounds of gunfire, hitting both the mother and daughter, according to the Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nInvestigators said the victims were in a car stopped at a light when a second vehicle pulled up next to them and someone opened fire. The shooter escaped.\nHall exited the driver\u2019s side of the car and fell to the ground, mortally wounded. The car continued moving forward with Martin, wounded, in the passenger seat. It struck a signal pole on the southeast corner of the intersection, where Martin was found unresponsive, according to the Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nBrown fled southbound on South Central Avenue and his whereabouts remain unknown, sheriff\u2019s officials said.\nThe department said detectives have exhausted all leads in the search for Brown and are seeking the public\u2019s assistance in locating him.

      "text": "San Bernardino to pay nearly $5 million to family of man shot by police. Family says he was unarmed\n- Share via\n- The city of San Bernardino agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of a man killed in 2023 by police after a foot pursuit.\n- Police say the man, Robert Brown, was armed. His family say a body-cam video shows he was empty-handed at the time of the shooting.\nThe city of San Bernardino has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of a man killed by police during a foot pursuit in 2023, with most of the settlement expected to go to the man\u2019s young son, according to lawyers for the family.\nPolice alleged Robert Brown was holding a firearm as he ran from police and jumped over a fence, but relatives of the 28-year-old man claimed body-camera video of the deadly shooting suggested Brown was empty-handed when he was shot.\nA video edited and released by San Bernardino police of the incident shows Brown holding what appears to be a handgun just moments before he climbs over a backyard fence, and is shot through the fence by the officer.\nOn Wednesday, city officials announced after a closed session meeting that they would agree to a $4,875,000 settlement with Brown\u2019s family, said Jeff Kraus, a spokesperson for the city.\nAn attorney for Brown\u2019s family at one point accused police of planting a gun after the shooting, stating it took police hours to find the firearm following the shooting.\nUnarmed Mickel Lewis Sr. was killed by Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Jason Ayala. The jury award is the second-highest in a police shooting case in California, an attorney says.\nPolice said in an initial news release that a motorcycle officer tried to pull Brown over at 6:45 a.m. on Dec. 27, 2023, because of a vehicle code violation near 7th Street and Sierra Way.\nBut instead of stopping, Brown ran away from the officer, jumping over a backyard fence.\n\u201cStop! Get on the Ground!\u201d the police officer, identified as Jackson Tubbs in the initial claim filed by the family, is heard yelling at Brown in body-camera footage. \u201cGet on the ground!\u201d\nPolice alleged Brown was holding a 9-millimeter handgun.\nIn the initial claim filed with the city, attorneys for the family pointed out that the video showed Brown pulling himself over the fence with both hands empty, suggesting he wasn\u2019t holding a gun in either hand.\nBut the video released by police shows Brown tumbling for a second after running from his car, and a still image appears to show him holding a handgun in his right hand. The police video also shows Brown pulling himself over the fence with both hands.\nLt. Jennifer Kohrell, who narrates the video, said the video shows Brown tossing the gun over the fence before climbing over, and is seen by Tubbs kneeling down on the other side of the fence. In the video, it\u2019s not clear if Brown tosses an object over, and he is not visible beyond the fence.\nThe video shows Tubbs doesn\u2019t immediately jump over the fence in pursuit of Brown, but instead shoots through the fence, fatally wounding Brown.\nAttorney Brad Gage, who filed the suit on behalf of Brown\u2019s sister, Victoria Brown, said Brown\u2019s parents will receive $175,000 of the settlement.\nThe rest of the funds will go to the estate of Robert Brown, whose primary beneficiary is expected to be his son, who was 6 years old at the time of the shooting.\n\u201cIt all goes to the benefit of the child, but has to be approved by a judge,\u201d Gage said. \u201cThis is all about protecting the child.\u201d\nThe funds would be put away until the child\u2019s 18th birthday, he said. A judge would determine who would serve as the boy\u2019s guardian."

      "text": "Army veteran sought in Montana bar shooting that left 4 dead\n- Share via\nANACONDA, Mont. \u2014 A shooting at a Montana bar left four people dead Friday, prompting a lockdown in a neighborhood several miles away as authorities searched for the suspect in a wooded, mountainous area.\nThe shooting happened around 10:30 a.m. at the Owl Bar in Anaconda, according to the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation, which is leading the investigation. The agency confirmed four people were pronounced dead at the scene.\nThe suspect, identified as 45-year-old Army veteran Michael Paul Brown, lived next door, according to public records and bar owner David Gwerder.\nThe bartender and three patrons were killed, said Gwerder, who was not there at the time. He believed the four victims were the only ones present during the shooting, and he was not aware of any prior conflicts between them and Brown.\n\u201cHe knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,\u201d Gwerder said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any running dispute with any of them. I just think he snapped.\u201d\nBrown\u2019s home was cleared by a SWAT team and he was last seen in the Stumptown area, just west of Anaconda, authorities said.\nMore than a dozen officers from local and state police converged on that area, locking it down so no one was allowed in or out. A helicopter hovered over a nearby mountainside as officers moved among the trees, said Randy Clark, a retired police officer who lives there.\nBrown was believed to be armed, the Montana Highway Patrol said in a statement.\nBrown served in the U.S. Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, according to Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said. He left military service in the rank of sergeant.\nAs reports of the shooting spread through town, business owners locked their doors and sheltered inside with customers. At Caterpillars to Butterflies Childcare, a nursery a few blocks from the shooting scene, owner Sage Huot said she\u2019d kept the children inside all day after someone called to let her know about the violence.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly doing practice drills, fire drills and active-shooter drills, so we locked down the facility, locked the doors, and we have a quiet spot where we play activities away from all of our windows and doors,\u201d Huot said.\nAnaconda is about 75 miles southeast of Missoula in a valley hemmed in by mountains. A town of about 9,000 people, it was founded by copper barons who profited off nearby mines in the late 1800s. A smelter stack that\u2019s no longer operational looms over the valley.\nThe owner of the Firefly Cafe in Anaconda said she locked up her business about 11 a.m. Friday after she was alerted to the shooting by a friend.\n\u201cWe are Montana, so guns are not new to us,\u201d cafe owner Barbie Nelson said. \u201cFor our town to be locked down, everybody\u2019s pretty rattled.\u201d\nBrown and Slevin write for the Associated Press. Brown reported from Montana and Slevin from Denver. AP writer Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Wash., contributed to this report."
