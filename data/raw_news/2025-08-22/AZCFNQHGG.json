  "title": "Iran to hold call with European nations over nuclear program as sanctions deadline draws closer",
  "description": "Iran's foreign minister is planning a call with French, German, and British counterparts to avoid U.N. sanctions over its nuclear program. The call planned for Friday, reported by Iran's state-run...",
  "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Just days away from a European deadline, Iran said Friday its foreign minister would hold a telephone conference call with his French, German and British counterparts to avoid the reimposition of United Nations sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nThe call, planned for Friday by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, comes as the three parties to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal threaten to reimpose those sanctions under a mechanism known as \u201csnapback\u201d in the accord. The European Union's chief diplomat will also join the call, IRNA said.\n\nThe Europeans' concern over the Iranian program, which had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels before the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June saw its atomic sites bombed, has only grown since Tehran cut off all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the conflict's wake. That has left the international community further blinded to Iran's program \u2014 as well as the status of its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nIran has long insisted its program is peaceful, though it is the only non-nuclear-armed nation enriching uranium at that level. The U.S., the IAEA and others assess Iran had a nuclear weapons program up until 2003.\n\nIn a letter Aug. 8, the three European nations warned Iran it would proceed with \u201csnapback\u201d if Tehran didn't reach a \u201csatisfactory solution\u201d to the nuclear issues. That deadline would be Aug. 31, in nine days, leaving little time for Iran to likely reach any agreement with the Europeans, who have grown increasingly skeptical of Iran over years of inconclusive negotiations over its nuclear program.\n\nRestoring the IAEA's access is a key part of the talks. Iran has blamed the war with Israel in part on the IAEA, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, without offering any evidence. The IAEA issues quarterly reports on Iran's program and the 2015 deal gave it greater access to keep track of it.\n\nIran has also threatened its director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, with arrest if he comes to Iran, further complicating talks. Grossi is considering running to become the U.N.'s secretary-general, something Tehran has seized on as well in its criticisms of the Argentine diplomat.\n\nThe \u201csnapback\u201d power in the nuclear accord expires in October, also putting pressure on the Europeans to potentially use it as leverage with Iran before losing that ability.\n\nUnder \u201csnapback,\u201d any party to the deal can find Iran in noncompliance, reimposing the sanctions. After it expires, any sanctions effort could face a veto from U.N. Security Council members China and Russia, two nations that have provided some support to Iran in the past but stayed out of the June war.",
