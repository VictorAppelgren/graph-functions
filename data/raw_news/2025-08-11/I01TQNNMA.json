  "content": "They\u2019ve gone to the dogs \u2026 and they\u2019re not going anywhere.\n\nPup-obsessed New Yorkers are curtailing their summer travel plans and nights out rather than leave Fido home alone \u2014 or going to expensive lengths to take their pets with them.\n\nWhen 29-year-old Upper East Sider Jordan Cohen\u2019s family told him they preferred he and his fianc\u00e9, Christine Silikowski, 30, not bring their Golden retriever puppy Hudson to family gatherings in Port Washington, the couple knew how to respond.\n\n\u201cWe just started saying we couldn\u2019t come,\u2019\u2019 Silikowski told The Post, adding, \u201cWe actually go out less [because of the dog].\u201d\n\nAt Sojourn Social on the Upper East Side, owner Sammy Musovic said he\u2019s had over 1,000 people ask if they could dine with their pups. The restaurant and watering hole now caters to dogs and their owners with regular puppy hours \u2014 complete with free \u201cbarcuterie\u201d plates for four-legged customers and drink specials for two-legged patrons \u2014 that draw crowds.\n\nOn a recent night, Yorkville couple Rich Weiss, 38, and Maggie O\u2019Keefe, 40, enjoyed the offerings with their small, mixed-breed pooch, Leo.\n\n\u201cWe bring Leo because we try to maintain an emotional connection with him, the way we would with a biological child,\u2019\u2019 Weiss said.\n\nNew Yorkers\u2019 obsessions are part of a nationwide trend. A recent survey by TrustedHousesitters found that nearly half of US pet owners feel separation anxiety if they travel without their animals, while 54% worry their pets will feel abandoned while they are away.\n\nJill Xu, a 28-year old who lives in Nomad, takes her 4.5-pound Maltipoo, Hershey, with her on her travels because she\u2019s concerned about his mental health.\n\n\u201cHe is shy and was bullied when he was little, so I wasn\u2019t OK with putting him in dog care,\u2019\u2019 she told The Post.\n\nThe tiny pup is currently jet-setting around Europe with Xu and her husband.\n\n\u201cHe really enjoys coming with us; you can just see it in his expression and how much his nose wiggles,\u201d she said of the lucky dog, who has an EU pet passport to make getting around easier. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine not bringing him.\u201d\n\nXu and her husband have faced some judgement because of how they treat Hershey.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s ridiculous, and it is difficult because we have to call ahead to every site and restaurant to make sure they accept dogs, but even if we travel with friends I insist on bringing him,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile many of the most dog-obsessed New Yorkers don\u2019t have kids, some do \u2014 but are seemingly more concerned about their four-legged family members.\n\n\u201cMy clients are happy to put their kids in summer camp, but won\u2019t get on a plane without their dogs,\u2019\u2019 said Edward Alava, owner of the Dog Store, a pet boutique and dog salon on East 61st. \u201cSome bring them in to get a lavender bath and massage to calm them before getting on a flight.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo get around restrictions on flying with dogs on commercial airlines, semi-private pet travel has become increasingly popular.\n\nBARK Air, which flies out of Teterboro, launched in May 2024, offering flights from New York to London and Los Angeles on chartered Gulfsteam jets.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s president, Michael Novotny, the airline has flown more than 1,000 dogs on 142 flights, and produced $6 million in revenue.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a 200-pound Bernese Mountain Dog, and Yorkies,\u2019\u2019 reported Novotny.\n\nEarlier this year, BARK Air expanded to offer flights Fort Lauderdale, for as little as $900. Taking the airline to Europe \u2014 it now flies from New York to London, Milan, Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Lisbon \u2014 can cost over $10,000 for a person and their pup, and often sell out. Novotny justifies the cost.\n\n\u201cWe get to know every dog, so we know their needs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emotional cost of leaving your dog at home is greater than the financial cost.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier this year, a similarly pet-centric airline, RetrievAir, launched with flights leaving from Farmingdale, Long Island. Like BARK Air, it offers various amenities to dogs onboard, such as treats and calming music.\n\n\u201cI knew there was demand and most people understand it makes the trip better to bring your dogs along, and you don\u2019t have to worry about them being sad at home,\u201d said founder Benton Miller, 33.\n\nFares range from $949 to go to Ft. Lauderale to $2,800 for Los Angeles, with dogs up to 40 pounds flying free. Seats need to be purchased for bigger dogs, but if two people are flying, the dog seat is thrown in gratis.\n\nCohen and Silikowski, who plan to have Hudson in their wedding next month, are looking into traveling with the dog on RetrievAir.\n\nSilikowski said, \u201cWe would to show him new places.\u2019\u2019",

      "text": "DEAR ABBY: My sister, \u201cJenny,\u201d and I have had a falling-out and no longer speak. She\u2019s upset with me because she found out her adult daughter, \u201cPaisley,\u201d had moved without telling anyone.\nI discovered it when Paisley had some mail sent to my house and later revealed she had moved across the country. Jenny and Paisley were no-contact; they had a huge argument six months ago and haven\u2019t spoken since. I was in contact with both. Paisley explicitly told me that she didn\u2019t want to deal with her mother.\nWhen I found out Paisley had moved, I asked if she wanted me to tell her mom because Jenny had blocked her. She said no. Our mom found out because Paisley also had her mail sent to Mom\u2019s home, and Mom thought she was still in town. Mom told Jenny, and Jenny erupted on me. I thought I was doing what everyone wanted. Was I the villain in the story? \u2014 CONFOUNDED IN KENTUCKY\nDEAR CONFOUNDED: You did nothing wrong. Your sister erupted on you because you were handy. It\u2019s a shame your sister and her daughter couldn\u2019t mend fences, but the fault doesn\u2019t lie with you. Paisley moved to escape the dysfunction in the family, which may have been wise, because there appears to be plenty of it. You are not a villain, and you should not accept being labeled that way.\nDEAR ABBY: My spouse continuously scrolls through video posts on her cellphone while we are in the same room. I have asked her to please engage her earphones, but she seldom does. Now, I simply turn off the TV and wait sometimes for up to a couple of hours before she quits. I don\u2019t dare tell her that this is annoying. I have tried going into other rooms but feel trapped in my own home with her scrolling nonsense. When I have tried to talk to her, she throws all my faults in my face to shut me down on this subject. Suggestions? \u2014 HEARING TOO MUCH IN OHIO\nDEAR HEARING: Yes, I suggest that while your spouse has every right to disappear down the rabbit hole of her cellphone if she wishes, to insist on inflicting the audio on you is inconsiderate. Asking her to engage her earphones isn\u2019t rude \u2014 it\u2019s a natural response to being forced to be an unwilling audience. I have pointed out in the past that \u201cthe best defense is a strong offense.\u201d This is the tactic your spouse is employing so she won\u2019t have to cooperate.\nSome sessions with a licensed family therapist might help you to become more assertive. If you can\u2019t bring yourself to do that, then my last suggestion is this: Choose an activity that takes you away from the house and introduces you to friends with similar taste in entertainment to your own.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

      "text": "Peek inside a real doomsday bunker \u2014 with the 15 essential items preppers say will keep you alive for a year\nThey won\u2019t be doomed.\nA couple from Montana has turned to full-scale \u201cprepping\u201d in response to rising global tensions, they say \u2014 stockpiling enough supplies to survive a year off-grid in case of war, natural disaster, or prolonged power outages.\nCarrie and Colton Smith, both in their mid-30s, began preparing for an uncertain future in early 2023 \u2014 after a Chinese surveillance balloon was seen flying over the U.S., triggering national concern before being shot down.\nThe event was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the couple, prompting them to take survival into their own hands.\n\u201cI grew up in California, where there are earthquakes, so my family was always prepared for natural disasters \u2014 but the balloon took things to the next level for us,\u201d Carrie, a housewife who now shares prepping tips to over one million followers under the handle @housewifeprepper, told SWNS.\n\u201cI realized I needed to take matters into my own hands.\u201d\nSince then, the Smiths have amassed a wide range of supplies, including four generators, three 55-gallon water drums, freeze-dried foods with a 25-year shelf life, and various forms of protection such as firearms and tasers.\nThey\u2019ve also invested in solar panels, satellite phones, solar-crank radios, and even a life raft \u2014 an item she said once saved one of her followers\u2019 lives during a flood.\nThe Smiths believe they could survive for a year off their supplies.\n\u201cEvery homemaker should factor it in,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cIt\u2019s an extension of caring for your family.\u201d\nCarrie emphasized that prepping isn\u2019t just for major catastrophes.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just doomsday or World War 3; it could be a job loss, a natural disaster, anything,\u201d she said.\nThe couple has built a comprehensive plan, including \u201cbug-out bags\u201d for themselves and their Goldendoodle, Sky, to grab and go.\nThey\u2019ve spread their gear across several locations \u2014 including their home, cars, and even friends\u2019 houses \u2014 forming a small support network they can count on in a crisis.\nTheir supplies cover five core categories: food, water, shelter, self-defense, and communication.\nThough some may view their lifestyle as extreme, the Smiths say it\u2019s simply responsible.\n\u201cPrepping is very expensive and you can\u2019t do it overnight \u2014 but it\u2019s an investment, like a form of insurance,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about feeling confident in the supplies you have. It\u2019s not extreme, it\u2019s smart.\u201d\nCarrie noted that food, water, shelter and power are most important, followed by self-defense items and then communication tools.\n15 essential doomsday bunker items for preppers:\n\u2022 Water filtration & purification (portable filter, purification tablets/drops)\n\u2022 Stored water supply (at least one gallon per person per day)\n\u2022 Emergency food supply (freeze-dried meals, canned goods, rations)\n\u2022 Fire-starting tools (ferro rod, waterproof matches, lighter, tinder)\n\u2022 First aid kit (trauma supplies, meds, antiseptics, bandages)\n\u2022 Emergency shelter (tarp, lightweight tent, mylar blanket)\n\u2022 Warm clothing & insulation (wool socks, thermals, waterproof layers, gloves)\n\u2022 Multi-tool or survival knife (fixed blade preferred)\n\u2022 Light sources (headlamp + flashlight with spare batteries or solar)\n\u2022 Navigation tools (compass, maps, GPS backup if possible)\n\u2022 Portable power source (solar charger, power bank, tri-fuel generator, solar generator)\n\u2022 Communication gear (emergency radio, whistle, backup phone, satellite phone)\n\u2022 Self-defense tools (pepper spray, firearm, where legal, or alternative)\n\u2022 Sanitation & hygiene items (soap, wipes, toilet paper, waste bags)\n\u2022 Important documents & cash (waterproof bag with ID, cash, emergency contacts)"

His career with EasyJet is doomed.\u201d\nThe incident occurred Aug. 9 after the veteran flyboy had reportedly just gotten done ferrying vacationers from the UK to Cape Verde, an idyllic island nation in West Africa.\nHe reportedly checked in at the five-star Meli\u00e1 Dunas Beach Resort & Spa, whereupon he proceeded to embark on a post-flight booze binge.\nHis bender eventually spiraled out of control.\nAt around 2:30 a.m. Aug. 5, appalled guests reportedly witnessed the plastered pilot undress and wander into the reception area, before continuing on to the gym and spa in his birthday suit. He was reportedly in a \u201cparalytic\u201d state, sources said.\n\u201cThe pilot did not have a stitch on and reeked of alcohol,\u201d another anonymous airline insider told the outlet.\nTo make matters worse, the flyboy was slated to make the 2,332-nautical-mile trip back to Gatwick in London on the afternoon of Aug. 6, the BBC reported.\nHowever, onlookers identified the boozy bozo and alerted the EasyJet brass, who took him off the plane and found a replacement.\n\u201cAs soon as we were made aware, the pilot was immediately stood down from duty, in line with our procedures,\u201d an airline rep declared. \u201cThe safety of our passengers and crew is EasyJet\u2019s highest priority.\u201d\nThey have since launched a probe into the pilot\u2019s naked antics.\nThe aforementioned source agreed with the decision on the grounds that \u201canyone who saw the pilot cavorting naked in the early hours on the day before a flight would not dream of getting on a plane with him at the controls.\u201d\n\u201cHe was so drunk that you wouldn\u2019t have put him in charge of a toy airplane, never mind the real thing with hundreds of passengers,\u201d they said. \u201cWe all make mistakes but the level of stupidity on display here by a veteran captain beggars belief.\u201d\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first sky captain to get busted for hitting the sauce before a flight.\nEarlier this year, a Southwest Airlines pilot was arrested shortly before takeoff in Georgia after he allegedly showed up to work intoxicated, police say."
