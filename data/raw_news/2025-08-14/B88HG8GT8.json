  "content": "Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one the AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching Closely. On August 12, Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow reiterated a Sell rating on the stock with a $175.00 price target. The firm said that it is sticking with its sell rating and that it is cautious on the company\u2019s full self-driving.\n\nCEO Elon Musk unveiled some important updates around both the Robotaxi operations in Austin and the upcoming FSD model. The updates were made in a series of posts on X over the weekend.\n\nWhile Tesla shares \u201csomewhat paradoxically\u201d rallied on the news, names like Uber and Lyft who were previously sensitive to Tesla autonomy, did too. The firm considers this as \u201cmixed signals from the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the Robotaxi operations in Austin, CEO Musk indicated it would be open to the public next month, which we believe is earlier than investor expectations and a sign of confidence in the service and feedback from the invite-only riders to date. We believe the expanded FSD model has positive implications for bulls focused on the potential for TSLAs fleet eventually becoming Robotaxis (positive read on inference compute), and the opening of the Austin Robotaxi experience to the public is a key step on the growth path of inviting a potentially more critical set of consumers. While safety drivers will remain, and no timeline has been provided for their removal, bulls have been willing to overlook the optics of safety drivers in TSLA vehicles, and we see no reason why that would change now.\u201d\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 10 AI Stocks Investors Are Watching Closely and 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching Closely.",

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

      "text": "The United States is stepping up its efforts to prevent the illegal diversion if its advanced artificial intelligence chips to China. In latest news, sources have revealed that the country has placed location tracking devices in targeted shipments of its chips. These chips, they believe, are at high risk of illegal diversions.\nThe move aims to proactively detect AI chips being diverted to locations which are under US export restrictions. The sources reveal that these tracking devices apply only to select shipments under investigation.\nThrough the trackers, the government will be able to build cases against parties who profit from violating U.S. export controls. It is said that the trackers are typically hidden in the packaging of the server shipments. However, it is not known which parties have been involved in installing them and where they were put in along the shipping route.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q1 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n10. Pony AI Inc. (NASDAQ:PONY)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 13\nPony AI Inc. (NASDAQ:PONY) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Investors Are Watching Closely. On August 12, the company announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. It announced producing over 200 Gen-7 robotaxi vehicles as of August 11, which positions it well on track to reach its target of 1,000 vehicles by year-end.\nThe company\u2019s second-quarter revenues increased 76% year-over-year to $21.5 million, attributed largely to its robotaxi services and licensing revenues. Robotaxi services revenues grew 158% to $1.5 million, whereas fare-charging revenues increased over 300%.\nPONY AI reports beginning mass production of its Gen-7 robotaxi models in June and July via partnerships with Guangzhou Automobile Group and Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation. Its fully-driverless commercial robotaxi services are operated across China\u2019s four tier-one cities; whereas it has also expanded operations to Dubai, South Korea, and Luxembourg.\n\u201cThis quarter marked a significant milestone in our journey toward large-scale production and deployment, further solidifying our leadership in the Robotaxi industry. Since mass production started two months ago, over 2001 Gen-7 Robotaxi vehicles have rolled off the production line, putting us firmly on track to hit the year-end 1,000-vehicle target. Our robust Robotaxi revenues more than doubled, with fare-charging revenues surging by over 300% year-over-year. The path toward positive unit economics is also clear, as we made substantial improvements in key cost items such as remote assistance and vehicle insurance. These achievements are underpinned by our rapid scaling and operational breakthroughs in all four tier-one cities in China, coupled with expanded presence in Dubai, South Korea and Luxembourg. As we enter the second half of this pivotal year of mass production, we are driving strongly toward positive unit economics and accelerating our multi-year growth trajectory.\u201d\n\u2013 Dr. James Peng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pony.ai.\nPony AI Inc. (NASDAQ:PONY) specializes in autonomous mobility, offering AI-driven robotruck and robotaxi services, intelligent driving software, and vehicle integration solutions.\n9. BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BBAI)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 17\nBigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BBAI) ) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Investors Are Watching Closely. On August 12, H.C. Wainwright analyst Scott Buck lowered the price target on the stock to $8.00 (from $9.00) while maintaining a Buy rating. The price target cut follows BigBear.ai\u2019s second quarter results which it posted after the markets closed on August 11th.\nThe firm discussed how the artificial intelligence company\u2019s revenue of $32.5 million was significantly below its $41 million estimate. BigBear.ai also lowered its full-year revenue guidance to $125.0M to $140.0M, down from $160.0M and $180.0M. The firm considers this low guidance to be because of lower 2Q25 revenue coupled with disruptions in federal contracts, particularly in programs supporting the U.S. Army.\nThe firm acknowledged that these results are disappointing, but also pointed out that they shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n\u201cWhile disappointing, these results should not come as a surprise given what we have heard from other reporting peers in the defense space, which have also experienced program delays. We believe revenue visibility could begin to improve as the business moves towards 2026.\u201d\nThe firm also considers BigBear.ai to be a beneficiary of the One Big Beautiful Bill.\n\u201cLonger term, we believe BigBear.ai is well positioned to be a beneficiary of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which substantially increases investment in areas aligned with the company\u2019s core competencies. This includes $170.0B of incremental funding to the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, the company solidified its balance sheet during 2Q25, ending the quarter with more than $390.0M of available cash. We expect this capital to be deployed in coming quarters, through reinvestment in the business as well as complementary M&A. While we expect shares to respond negatively to 2Q25 results and change in guidance, we see an improved balance sheet and favorable industry and legislative trends as catalysts for long term growth. As a result, we suspect operating results and outlook should look materially stronger a year from now. We recommend investors take advantage of any near term weakness in BBAI shares to accumulate a position ahead of more favorable operating results. We remain Buy-rated but ave lowered our price target to $8 from $9, reflecting our lower 2026 revenue forecast.\u201d\nBigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BBAI) is an artificial intelligence specialist that provides decision intelligence solutions for national security, digital identity, supply chain and logistics, enterprise operations, and manned-unmanned teaming in autonomous systems."

SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 18\nSoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching Closely. On August 11, Ladenburg Thalmann analyst Glenn Mattson upgraded the stock from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $16.00 (from $9.00). The rating upgrade comes after Soundhound posted second-quarter revenue well above expectations driven by its large contract wins.\nAccording to the firm, momentum in core verticals is helping offset previous concerns about low-margin contracts from the Amelia acquisition. These are anticipated to be phased out over the next 18 months.\nIt believes that SoundHound is building a broader platform that may link automotive, restaurant and enterprise customers into a voice-enabled ecosystem. This will in turn create lead-generation revenue streams.\n\u201cWe upgrade shares to Buy and raise our PT to $16 (from $9). We continue to view Voice as one of the key early applications for AI systems. The company is a leader in this space and is adding significant utility for enterprises looking to adopt AI functionality. The Amelia acquisition still needs further integration but is providing solid benefits in terms of scale, new lead generation, and an entry into the enterprise. While valuation remains elevated, the growth and scale justify that premium, in our view. We now use a 22x multiple on our new 2027 estimate to achieve our $16 PT. This is justified by the rule of 40 peer set found in the body of the report.\u201d\nSoundHound AI, Inc.

The firm considers this as \u201cmixed signals from the market.\u201d\n\u201cOn the Robotaxi operations in Austin, CEO Musk indicated it would be open to the public next month, which we believe is earlier than investor expectations and a sign of confidence in the service and feedback from the invite-only riders to date. We believe the expanded FSD model has positive implications for bulls focused on the potential for TSLAs fleet eventually becoming Robotaxis (positive read on inference compute), and the opening of the Austin Robotaxi experience to the public is a key step on the growth path of inviting a potentially more critical set of consumers. While safety drivers will remain, and no timeline has been provided for their removal, bulls have been willing to overlook the optics of safety drivers in TSLA vehicles, and we see no reason why that would change now.\u201d\nTesla, Inc.

SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 18\nSoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching Closely. On August 11, Ladenburg Thalmann analyst Glenn Mattson upgraded the stock from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $16.00 (from $9.00). The rating upgrade comes after Soundhound posted second-quarter revenue well above expectations driven by its large contract wins.\nAccording to the firm, momentum in core verticals is helping offset previous concerns about low-margin contracts from the Amelia acquisition. These are anticipated to be phased out over the next 18 months.\nIt believes that SoundHound is building a broader platform that may link automotive, restaurant and enterprise customers into a voice-enabled ecosystem. This will in turn create lead-generation revenue streams.\n\u201cWe upgrade shares to Buy and raise our PT to $16 (from $9). We continue to view Voice as one of the key early applications for AI systems. The company is a leader in this space and is adding significant utility for enterprises looking to adopt AI functionality. The Amelia acquisition still needs further integration but is providing solid benefits in terms of scale, new lead generation, and an entry into the enterprise. While valuation remains elevated, the growth and scale justify that premium, in our view. We now use a 22x multiple on our new 2027 estimate to achieve our $16 PT.
