It has to be different and you have to identify opportunities to get students out of the classroom and into situations where they're doing work that is relevant and meaningful.\"\n\nThis new e-book guides districts through every stage of developing a new CTE center from initial planning and designing to staffing and recruiting, including:\n\u2022 Funding a CTE Center: Learn how to navigate a variety of funding options such as bonds and grants.\n\u2022 Building a New CTE Center: Learn about various planning considerations and how to meet the requirements of each CTE pathway, allow for future expansion, and integrate industry-standard technologies.\n\u2022 Converting an Existing Space into a CTE Center: Understand renovation considerations and how to transform outdated school buildings or old office spaces into modern CTE centers.\n\u2022 CTE Centers in a Rural or : Recognize planning considerations and how to use out-of-the-box thinking to create successful CTE offerings in unique settings.\n\n\"At iCEV, we are constantly visiting CTE centers all over the country and it's great to see how they are being creative and utilizing different spaces to make programs that students love,\" said Moore. \"It doesn't matter if it's an existing space they're reconfiguring or a brand-new space, it's about what they're actually doing in the space that matters.\"\n\nTo learn more and download iCEV's \"Building High-Impact CTE Centers: Lessons from District Leaders\" e-book, visit here.\n\nAbout iCEV and Eduthings\n\niCEV offers Eduthings, a powerful data management platform designed to streamline reporting for key components of Career and Technical Education (CTE), including industry certifications, work-based learning, and participation in Career and Technical Student Organizations (CTSOs).\n\nSince 1984, iCEV has been a trusted leader in CTE, delivering high-quality curriculum and educational resources that empower educators and students alike.
