  "title": "Qualcomm Execs Discuss Plans For Growth In Automotive, IoT And Beyond",
  "description": "The company has spent 40 years pioneering new types of mobile chip technology, but can it translate that into similar success \u2014 and scale \u2014 in other markets?",
  "content": "Qualcomm celebrated its 40th anniversary this year. Across those four decades, the company built its reputation as a supplier of chips for mobile phones. But while it retains a dominant position in that market, these days an increasing amount of its business comes from other rapidly growing sectors, including automotive, IoT, PCs, the datacenter and, on the horizon, robotics.\n\nYet even after supplying all the processors for the first wave of Copilot+ PCs a year ago, and after its recent deal to equip datacenters in Saudi Arabia, and even with a well-established automotive business that grew 55% last year and has a $50 billion pipeline of orders, Wall Street seems unconvinced by Qualcomm\u2019s diversification story. So while its leaders received the honor of ringing the bell at the stock market on its anniversary, their work hasn\u2019t been similarly rewarded in terms of the company\u2019s valuation. What gives?\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to interview four of Qualcomm\u2019s top operating executives \u2014 each of them with more than 20 years at the company \u2014 in part to talk about the defining characteristics that have set Qualcomm apart so far, but with a greater emphasis on where the company is headed across multiple new markets in this era of AI. These interviews offered extraordinary access to the company\u2019s strategic thinking as it tries to extend its ecosystem-based approach into one new sector after another.\n\nNote that Qualcomm is an advisory client of my company, Moor Insights & Strategy. That said, these interviews were conducted on the record, and Qualcomm was consulted during the editorial process only to confirm the accuracy of the technical details and quotes provided here.\n\nAll four of the executives I talked to have been with Qualcomm since the 1990s or early 2000s, and all of them described it as ecosystem-oriented from the start. Nakul Duggal, who runs Qualcomm\u2019s fast-growing automotive and IoT businesses, just celebrated his 30th anniversary there; he told me that \u201cI\u2019ve always seen Qualcomm as an ecosystem company.\u201d Durga Malladi, who oversees technology planning and coordinates the company\u2019s AI initiatives \u2014 besides running its new datacenter business \u2014 joined Qualcomm after earning his Ph.D. at UCLA in 1998. He summarized the engineering mindset back then as, \u201cWe know we are a systems company, and so we\u2019ve got to think from an overall systems perspective.\u201d\n\nCFO and COO Akash Palkhiwala, who joined in 2001, framed Qualcomm\u2019s approach in contrast to many other tech companies. \u201cWe are a creator of ecosystems; we are a creator of technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cOur role has always been about creating ecosystems, about creating technology \u2014 and enabling the industry with those things.\u201d Even though I interviewed each of the executives separately, they all came back to this theme without prompting again and again, applying it just as much to the company\u2019s current areas of expansion as its past successes.\n\nAlex Katouzian, who joined the company in 2002 and now runs its Mobile, Compute and XR Business Unit, connected this theme back to the company\u2019s early days in wireless. As an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego years before, he had studied under Qualcomm cofounder Andrew Viterbi, who helped develop the CDMA standard. Viterbi and other engineering leaders at the company first \u201crealized that CDMA was a better air interface,\u201d then \u201calso realized that this air interface is good for data\u201d \u2014 which, in time, led to the wireless internet. Katouzian credits these as \u201cmassive, massive pivotal points\u201d in the technical foundation of the company.\n\nCrucially, the leaders in those days didn\u2019t stop there, and Katouzian explains how their next steps set the dominoes in motion for Qualcomm\u2019s prominence in the wireless market \u2014 and its way of doing business even today. \u201cAfter proving out CDMA, what they did was they built the entire thing,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey went vertical. They built chipsets, they built the infrastructure. They built the phones, they had the software. They had the whole thing.\u201d Realizing how chipsets, software and IP licensing could work together to cement the company\u2019s commercial position, they concentrated on those things, which led to embedding technology and multimedia within the chipsets \u2014 and hence, Katouzian said, the capability of the phone to become a camera, a gaming machine, a video capture device and an interface to social media.\n\nLater, this led to the birth of the company\u2019s Snapdragon brand, as well as its movement into other end uses. As he put it, \u201cOnce I have multimedia, graphics, camera, gesture, video capture, then I can go into adjacent markets. And then that led to auto[motive], IoT, XR, PC and all the adjacent markets that we\u2019re trying to get into.\u201d Time and again, each of the executives I talked with came back to how Qualcomm\u2019s long history in designing for ecosystems that require high connectivity, small form factors and tight power management has set it up for success.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s Present And Future In Smartphones, Wearables And PCs\n\nToday, Katouzian oversees the part of the business that serves makers of smartphones, other mobile and smart devices (including XR), gaming gear and PCs \u2014 and all the Snapdragon platforms. Thinking about new types of mobile experiences, he believes that the smartphone will remain central as a \u201cvery big computing device that\u2019s with you all the time,\u201d unlike your car or your PC. This makes the smartphone the natural point of connection for smart glasses, watches, earbuds and so on.\n\nIncreasingly, these devices will work together to provide users with cool new experiences like shooting video with your smart glasses and sharing it to social media through your phone. At some point, it will be routine to do things like this using voice or gesture commands, and without even touching the phone in your pocket.\n\nBeyond these new types of UX, though, AI assistants will increasingly operate across a user\u2019s devices to create highly personalized experiences and bodies of data. If you follow advances in AI models, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the inferencing specificity of a model informed by the data coming from a set of smart glasses that sees and hears everything you do, plus a smartphone that knows pretty much everything about what you do in a day. While there are obviously important safeguards to have in place (Katouzian is also responsible for Qualcomm\u2019s security technology), this will surely be one of the ultimate expressions of the company\u2019s ecosystem mentality.\n\nCreating cross-device experiences is an area of acute focus for OEMs trying to compete with Apple when it comes to the stickiness of their products. I\u2019ve seen this in action for years, not least in my own use of Samsung Galaxy laptops, phones and watches, but Katouzian hit me with a startling statistic. \u201cIf you buy three devices from the same manufacturer,\u201d he told me, \u201cthe likelihood of you sticking with that manufacturer is over 95%.\u201d Apple nailed this years ago with easy syncing across iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods and so on. Qualcomm is now aiding OEMs in the Android universe, including Samsung and a slew of Chinese companies like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, by building end-to-end reference models \u2014 complete with Qualcomm\u2019s cutting-edge perception technologies \u2014 to help them nail down specific interactions and use cases across these devices.\n\nWe also talked about how PCs come into this picture. There\u2019s not enough space here to go into the details of Qualcomm\u2019s breakthrough role as the sole provider of processors for the first wave of Copilot+ PCs that launched a year ago. ( I\u2019ve written about that at length elsewhere , and I\u2019ll touch on it a little more in the following section about AI.) But during our conversation Katouzian made the point that AI PCs will also sync with smart wearables to enable new use cases. For instance, a technician performing field repairs might look at a piece of broken equipment using smart glasses; the glasses could then use the technician\u2019s PC to connect to the cloud for specialized AI models and technical information. Imagine how much easier the task will be when the smart glasses visually overlay a troubleshooting schematic on top of the faulty equipment, helping the technician pinpoint the trouble and make a quick repair.\n\nUse cases like these, and the AI PCs that can handle them, are not way off in the distance. And while the first generation of Copilot+ PCs already began to open up on-device AI functionality \u2014 and revolutionized PC battery life for road warriors like me \u2014 Katouzian is bullish about what we will see when second-generation Snapdragon X Elite-powered PCs come out in September.\n\nThese days, Qualcomm focuses on being an AI-led company in everything it does. Durga Malladi spends a lot of his time thinking about which parts of AI need to happen locally and which parts should happen in the cloud. His fundamental view, and Qualcomm\u2019s, is that AI must be hybrid. \u201cOne of the earliest viewpoints that we had was for AI to scale \u2014 we reached a conclusion that it cannot be just in the cloud,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to have a piece of the puzzle in the devices as well, and not just because [that] serves us. I mean, it\u2019s a nice narrative, but that\u2019s not the reason why.\u201d\n\nHe explained that, as consumers start using AI in all of their devices, they\u2019re not thinking of it as AI, but as a set of functionality that \u201cjust happens to be there all the time.\u201d They come to rely on it, and don\u2019t want their user experience to be defined by the quality of their connection to the cloud at that moment.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a place with great connectivity \u2014 Malladi gestured to the corporate meeting room he was sitting in \u2014 you might not need to run anything on-device, because some enterprise server will handle it. But what if you\u2019re using your laptop on a transatlantic flight? \u201cRegardless of the connectivity, we\u2019ve got to be able to make sure that AI experience remains,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that means you have to have the right kind of processing in all the devices.\u201d\n\nHe also made some acute observations about how quickly AI models are shrinking to deliver the same performance. \u201cYou know, DeepSeek from China made such a big deal back in January,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a 671-billion-parameter model, and I remember someone asking me, \u2018So what does this mean? Does it mean that in the U.S. we are losing our leadership?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Wait for two months.\u2019 And actually, it only took two months before a 32-billion-parameter model was already outperforming that 671-billion-parameter model.\u201d\n\nObviously, this progression tends to favor the idea of increasing the use of powerful smaller models on personal devices over time. More to the point, AI will become so ubiquitous that it will be fundamental to the experience of using those devices. In this context, Malladi said that Qualcomm coined the phrase \u201cAI is the new UI.\u201d He noted that, besides having a nice ring to it, \u201cIt\u2019s a true statement.\u201d He pointed out that the latest big change in UI was the rise of touch interfaces on smartphones 20 years ago. Before that, it was the move from green screens to GUIs 20 years before that. So he believes we\u2019re due for another major UI shift.\n\nAutomotive, smart wearables and even AI on personal and industrial devices can be seen as direct extensions of Qualcomm\u2019s original wireless business and ecosystem approach. But what is the thinking that governs its diversification beyond mobile in recent years and today? For COO Palkhiwala, it comes down to four principles:\n\u2022 Continue to lead \u2014 or \u201cset the design point\u201d \u2014 in handset technology. (I would add this corollary: Enter only those markets where you can capitalize on what you\u2019re already good at.)\n\u2022 Identify and target industries where there is incredibly high leverage of technology.\n\u2022 Target only those industries that are going through an inflection point.\n\u2022 Build the go-to-market muscle that is required for that industry.\n\nDuring my interviews as well as my other interactions with Qualcomm\u2019s leaders over the years, I can attest that they are highly disciplined about applying these principles. This leads again and again to that moment of recognition when you look into what they\u2019re proposing in a new market and say, \u201cOh, right, that does fit.\u201d\n\nThe easiest example of this is the automotive industry. Qualcomm\u2019s automotive chief, Nakul Duggal, explained the importance of first understanding a new market thoroughly. \u201cYou actually have to understand what ecosystem you are a part of and what the needs of that ecosystem are,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we took that approach with automotive almost a dozen years ago, and we spent essentially all of our time ... just understanding how this industry works, the people, the tier-ones [suppliers], the OEMs, the tier-twos, the software players. We did it globally.\u201d This approach helped them understand how to build a GTM process for the automotive business while they also built relationships \u201cat a time when nobody [in our space] was really spending a lot of time on auto as an industry.\u201d\n\nThat industry was certainly facing an inflection point \u2014 and entering a period where the leverage of technology was only increasing. I\u2019ll let Duggal explain it: \u201cWhat became pretty apparent was that this was an industry that was probably five years behind the rest of the [tech] ecosystem in terms of adoption of new technology, partly because it had an incumbent ecosystem that was fairly traditional, partly because it was risk-averse, partly because it hadn\u2019t really seen any major catalyst for destruction. And then as Tesla started to become very relevant in the U.S. and EVs started to become very relevant, there was certainly enough of a catalyst for people to start to think outside of the box.\u201d\n\nThat covers principles 2, 3 and 4, but what about capitalizing on what the company is already good at? Looking back, Duggal believes that Qualcomm positioned itself well \u201cin terms of shaping the company\u2019s pivot from a consumer company that does smartphones, to a systems company that actually does all types of silicon.\u201d\n\nHe sees it as a multi-step journey, starting with connectivity. \u201cWe took our smartphone roadmap and we converted it to a digital cockpit roadmap and brought an ecosystem along with it.\u201d Then, however, they decided they needed to expand the focus to include driver assistance, safety and (ecosystem alert!) \u201cbuilding the stack.\u201d Duggal believes that Qualcomm\u2019s journey \u201chas allowed us to embrace full diversification towards a new ecosystem, while at the same time leveraging a lot of the core capabilities and competency within the company.\u201d\n\nIn the decade-plus since then, the company has continued to expand its automotive capabilities through a mix of organic and inorganic growth. Palkhiwala used the automotive example to explain Qualcomm\u2019s build-versus-buy logic. \u201cWe built chipsets organically because we already had the core technology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe built software for digital cockpit organically, because we are big experts at Android, and we know how to do that. But where we did not have the talent was to build a stack for ADAS. And so in that case, we acquired competence from someone who had been in the industry and knew how to scale that market.\u201d Speed is a major consideration: \u201cIf we see a missing piece of technology that has an established industry technology, we don\u2019t want to wait and develop it organically.\u201d\n\nSpeed is especially important given the rise of the Chinese automotive industry, which moves fast. Just like Tesla was disrupting the U.S. auto market a decade ago, BYD and others are doing the same to the global auto market today. I\u2019ll cover this in more detail in an upcoming deep dive, because Duggal and I discussed this for a while. The thing to note for now is that Qualcomm is acutely aware of the challenges of building stacks that accommodate all the regional variations in markets, AI use and even physical geographies \u2014 and it\u2019s doing something about it.\n\n\u201cWe went to China in 2023 and we realized that we were a little bit behind on ADAS,\u201d Duggal told me. \u201cNobody was using our ADAS silicon digital after Covid [then], but we are now deployed across 20 different Chinese automakers.\u201d Qualcomm also has a big partnership with BMW that is bearing fruit. The results? \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in 60 countries by the end of the year, in 100 countries next year.\u201d\n\nExpansion Into IoT, The Datacenter And Robotics\n\nDuggal understandably has a reputation for getting things done, so he\u2019s now added IoT products to his portfolio. The company\u2019s definition certainly includes the kind of smart home and industrial applications that we typically think of for \u201cIoT,\u201d but it is broader than that. The five areas that Duggal and his team have defined are industrial connectivity, consumer and commercial, cameras, industrial processors and robotics. (More on robotics in a moment.) They have also targeted a number of specific verticals including retail, industrial automation, public safety and energy and utilities.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not hard to see how these specific areas relate to the four principles of diversification that Palkhiwala laid out \u2014 especially as new IoT paradigms incorporating AI take hold and potentially disrupt many different sectors. Qualcomm\u2019s expertise in delivering high performance at a specific power level also seems tailor-made for IoT. To put it another way, whereas plenty of chip makers are constrained in what they can offer at the network edge and on individual devices, Qualcomm has been thriving in that zone for decades. And again the team has gone out of its way to understand the markets being entered, with different GTM actions for \u201ccertain customers that know what they\u2019re doing\u201d and need less support, as Duggal put it, versus others that \u201care not as conversant\u201d and need Qualcomm to build out the stack rather than only providing silicon.\n\nIf you\u2019d asked me a few years ago, I would not have been as optimistic about Qualcomm\u2019s recent entry into the datacenter market. When we talked, Malladi pointed out in good humor that the company has tried this more than once in the past. Yet its recent deal with the Saudi-backed AI company Humain \u2014 announced in connection with President Trump\u2019s visit to Arabia \u2014 suggests significantly more traction this time.\n\nI don\u2019t expect Qualcomm to overtake Nvidia or AMD (the two other chip companies that announced big deals on the same trip) in the datacenter anytime soon, but it does bring something special to the table because of its long history of lowering energy consumption in virtually everything it does. \u201cWe feel like that\u2019s a new angle that we bring to the datacenter for everything that the incumbents today have,\u201d Malladi explained. \u201cWe say, \u2018I\u2019ll match your performance and I'll lower the energy consumption.\u2019 That's where things are different for us.\u201d I can see that message resonating louder and louder as AI datacenters continue to gulp down energy at rates beyond what we\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nLike the datacenter, robotics represents a potentially huge market for Qualcomm. Palkhiwala thinks it\u2019s a natural fit for the company\u2019s diversification principles. The robotics industry is undergoing a massive transition from task-specific, non-mobile robots \u2014 think of the big ones that install body panels on automotive assembly lines \u2014 to autonomous general-purpose (and often humanoid) robots. The latter will rely on low-power, high-performance CPUs, GPUs and wireless technology to employ AI at the edge. More than that, they will need good cameras, not to mention elements of ADAS and XR. So even in this simple description, we\u2019ve touched on about ten different areas where Qualcomm already has world-class expertise. Plus it\u2019s a market driven by highly technical OEMs, which again sits right in Qualcomm\u2019s wheelhouse in terms of GTM.\n\nLet me emphasize that it\u2019s early, early days for robotics of the type we\u2019re talking about. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident that the two big chip companies talking about robotics the most this year are Nvidia and Qualcomm \u2014 and I won\u2019t be surprised if the two of them make hay in the robotics market in years to come.\n\nHow Do You Value A Company Like Qualcomm?\n\nMark my words: history will show that getting compute as close to the data as you can is the most efficient thing you can do. Irwin Jacobs, Andrew Viterbi and their colleagues may not have thought of it that way when they were launching Qualcomm 40 years ago, but the company has positioned itself very well indeed to take advantage of this truth, which I believe is even more relevant in this era of \u2014 hybrid, high-speed, always-on \u2014 AI.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s success in mobile means that a lot of people think of it as the mobile chip company \u2014 and it is. But as we\u2019ve seen, it has also been very thoughtfully diversifying for many years, with growing success. (For more numbers on that, see my writeup of its investor day in late 2024 .) And its position in the technology landscape is unique. During our conversation, Malladi said, \u201cWe already are there in products that can range from doorbells to datacenters. Now think of one company in the industry that has that kind of scale or the ability to bring in those kinds of skills.\u201d The fact is, Qualcomm is alone in that position, because there\u2019s nobody else who does that.\n\nThis is hardly a matter of touting uniqueness for its own sake, because the company keeps showing how practical its differentiation is across mobile devices, PCs, automotive, IoT and so on. Malladi put it very plainly: \u201cIn effect, we have invested significantly in energy-efficient high-performance computing. It\u2019s not just high performance by itself, but energy-efficient high-performance computing.\u201d\n\nThat combination of efficiency and performance speaks for itself in mobile devices. But it has also completely changed the battery-use paradigm for anyone using a Copilot+ PC. It will most certainly matter \u2014 even up to a geopolitical level \u2014 when it comes to AI datacenters. And Qualcomm\u2019s engineers have been designing on this basis week in and week out since the 1980s.\n\nThe operational challenge now is for Qualcomm to maintain its level of technical and business performance as it scales up. I\u2019m talking about scaling numbers of chip cores from tiny mobile applications, through the intermediate levels of PCs, software-defined vehicles and edge servers, all the way up to the big iron of the datacenter. And I\u2019m talking about scaling up in terms of the number of industries it serves at volume. I like the company\u2019s chances, considering the track records of these executives, their boss, Cristiano Amon, and their predecessors going back to Jacobs.\n\nWhen will that be enough for Qualcomm to achieve the kind of success on Wall Street already enjoyed by technology darlings like Nvidia? I don\u2019t know. Maybe the company is taken for granted, or maybe its non-mobile businesses don\u2019t yet represent large enough chunks of its top line. Maybe the uniqueness of its position in the landscape \u2014 and why it\u2019s important \u2014 isn\u2019t clear enough. It\u2019s not as splashy as Tesla in SDVs, as famous as Intel or AMD in CPUs or as lava-hot as Nvidia in AI.\n\nPalkhiwala \u2014 who, you\u2019ll recall, is CFO as well as COO \u2014 seemed philosophical when I asked him about it. \u201cI think investors largely understand our diversification strategy, but they want to see it play out in numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we are heads-down, focused on what we told investors we will do.\u201d He believes that continued execution will provide the Street with the proof points to support a higher valuation.\n\n\u201cThe technology portfolio [we have] is \u2018one of one\u2019 in this industry,\u201d he added, \u201cand that is what matters in the long term \u2014 really being able to leverage that portfolio to execute on the plan we\u2019ve already laid out.\u201d He sees the datacenter and robotics as the two largest markets available to Qualcomm, which \u201cadds a steeper slope to our growth opportunity. . . . I think, over time, investors will see it and will get rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nThere are countless execution steps between here and there, but I can\u2019t wait to see what unfolds.",

  "summary": "Qualcomm, a supplier of chips for mobile phones, celebrated its 40th anniversary this year with a significant growth in other rapidly growing sectors including automotive, IoT, PCs, the datacenter and robotics. However, Wall Street has been unimpressed with the company's diversification efforts, despite its dominance in the mobile phone market. Four of Qualcomm's top operating executives, each with over 20 years at the company, were interviewed to discuss plans for growth in these sectors.
