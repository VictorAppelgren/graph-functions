  "content": "WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. and LOUISVILLE, Colo., Aug. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The demand for nutrient-dense food and beverage options continues to rise as consumers prioritize health-conscious choices. In fact, one in four people in the U.S. (27%) report being on a weight loss journey and nearly 10% of the U.S. population has used a GLP-1 medication. 1 For many, this creates unique nutrition challenges \u2013 including meeting daily protein needs to help prevent muscle loss. Research suggests that muscle mass accounts for approximately 20% of weight lost while on a GLP-1 medication. 2 OIKOS \u2013 the #1 high protein yogurt brand in the U.S. \u2013 is stepping up to the challenge to support consumer needs and goals by introducing OIKOS FUSION: a first of its kind, nutrient-dense cultured dairy drink developed specifically to support muscle mass during weight loss, while also supporting digestive health.\n\nAs the #1 high protein yogurt brand in the U.S ., OIKOS \u00ae partnered with nutrition scientists and dietitians to create OIKOS FUSION. This product highlights Danone North America's commitment to supporting consumers' evolving health and wellness journeys through innovation.\n\nMade with the patented Advanced FUSION Blend\u2122 , OIKOS FUSION delivers 23g of complete protein , 5g of prebiotic fiber , and key vitamins like D , B3, and B12, in a compact, lactose-free, 0g added sugar drink. Available in three flavors: Strawberry, Mixed Berry, and Vanilla.\n\nNew OIKOS FUSION\u2122 is the first product in the yogurt category with a proprietary combination of whey, leucine and vitamin D designed to support the needs of GLP-1 users in a convenient, easy-to-enjoy format.\n\nIn the news release, OIKOS\u00ae Launches First-of-Its-Kind Cultured Dairy Drink Featuring A Patented Blend of Nutrients Designed to Help Build & Retain Muscle Mass During Weight Loss, issued 11-Aug-2025 by Danone North America over PR Newswire, we are advised by the company that the 8th paragraph, 1st and 2nd sentences, should read \"OIKOS FUSION drinks will initially launch in the refrigerated section of select retailers starting this August, with additional retailers rolling out this fall. For additional information on OIKOS FUSION and to find a retailer near you, visit Where to Buy Oikos Greek Yogurt and Pro Products.\" rather than \"OIKOS FUSION drinks will launch in Walmart's refrigerated section starting this August, with additional retailers rolling out nationwide in October. For additional information on OIKOS FUSION and to find a retailer near you, visit OikosYogurt.com.\" as originally issued inadvertently. The complete, corrected release follows:\n\nPowered by OIKOS' patented Advanced FUSION Blend, OIKOS FUSION is designed to help build and retain muscle mass during weight loss when combined with exercise and a balanced diet. It is the first and only product in the yogurt category specifically created and positioned to support the unique nutrition needs of GLP-1 users and other weight loss consumers, with a patented combination of whey protein, leucine and vitamin D. These three key nutrients have been extensively researched in populations at risk for muscle loss, including two clinical trials conducted by Danone. Together, this proprietary trifecta blend takes intentional muscle support to the next level by helping consumers maximally triggering muscle synthesis when paired with a balanced diet and exercise.3\n\n\"Pairing Danone's decades of science expertise with the OIKOS' brand's emphasis on strength and high-quality protein enabled us to create something truly unique for people looking to maintain muscle mass while on a weight loss journey,\" said Rafael Acevedo, President of Yogurt at Danone North America. \"The growing need for tailored nutrition solutions for people experiencing muscle mass loss is something we can expertly tackle. We know change takes strength and we believe weight loss isn't only about taking things away \u2014 it's about adding and strengthening routines with nutrient-dense products that help people better meet their goals.\"\n\nOIKOS FUSION comes in three delicious flavors including Strawberry, Mixed Berry, and Vanilla. Each nutrient-dense 7 fl oz, 130-calorie bottle is lactose-free and contains:\n\u2022 Vitamins B3 and B12 to help convert food to energy\n\u2022 A good source of calcium and key vitamins A and D\n\n\"People on a weight loss journey often eat less, so it's crucial to focus on the nutrient density of the foods they do eat. When protein needs are not met, the body will start breaking down muscle to get the amino acids it needs. Fiber is also important considering its role in digestive health and because most American fall short on fiber intake,\" explains Whitney Evans PhD, RD, Director of Nutrition & Scientific Affairs at Danone North America. \"That's why we created OIKOS FUSION\u2014in listening to GLP-1 users and studying the latest research, we packed as much targeted nutrition as possible into a small, delicious, and convenient bottle to help make it easier to meet key nutrition needs.\"\n\nBased on direct insights from those on GLP-1 medications, delivering this much nutrition in a compact size was top of mind for OIKOS. The 7 fl oz bottle format for OIKOS FUSION was chosen so that each consumer can enjoy \u2013 and comfortably finish consuming \u2013 a delicious, nutrient-dense drink.\n\nDanone also created a dedicated nutrition hub for GLP-1 users to deliver clear, credible guidance on the nutritional needs of GLP-1 medication users, featuring expert advice and product recommendations from across its yogurt and waters portfolio.\n\nOIKOS FUSION drinks will initially launch in the refrigerated section of select retailers starting this August, with additional retailers rolling out this fall.

      "text": "Story Highlights\n- Women more likely than men to say they are overweight, want to lose weight\n- 30% of U.S. adults report significant weight loss in past two years\n- About one-quarter each use wearable fitness tracker, app to track health\nEditor's Note: This research was conducted in partnership with West Health, a family of nonprofit and nonpartisan organizations focused on healthcare and aging.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- As the new year approaches and Americans consider their resolutions for 2025, losing weight may be on the minds of many. More than four in 10 U.S. adults, 43%, view themselves as overweight -- and even more, 55%, say they want to lose weight. However, only 27% report they are actively working toward that goal. Women continue to be more likely than men to say they are overweight and to express a desire to trim down.\nMeanwhile, 30% of Americans report having lost a significant amount of weight in the past two years, with 4% attributing the reduction to prescription medication.\nIn their effort to achieve better health, about one-quarter of U.S. adults use fitness trackers, such as smartwatches or smart rings, or monitor their health statistics using an app on their smartphone or tablet.\nThese findings are from Gallup\u2019s annual Health and Healthcare survey, conducted Nov. 6-20.\nLess Than Half of U.S. Adults Are Content With Their Weight\nFor the first time in Gallup\u2019s trend since 1999, less than half of U.S. adults describe their weight as about right (48%), while 43% say they are overweight -- either very (5%) or somewhat (38%). Few describe themselves as underweight, although the 8% currently doing so is one of the higher rates measured.\nGallup has tracked Americans\u2019 perceptions of their own weight almost every year since 1999. On average, those who believe their weight is about right have surpassed those who consider themselves overweight by 14 percentage points. The current five-point edge is the narrowest since 1999, as the percentage of people who consider themselves overweight is near its highest and the percentage of those who believe their weight is about right is near its lowest.\nAs Americans' self-reported weight has increased over the past two decades, they have adjusted their views of what their ideal weight is, which accounts for the relative steadiness in the trend on this measure.\nGender Imbalance in Perceptions of Weight Persists\nSince 1999, women have consistently been more likely than men to say they are overweight, and the latest 11-point gap is on the higher end historically. The 49% of women who think they are overweight ties the record high in 2001, while the 38% of men saying the same is about average.\nThere are also significant differences by age, with 26% of 18- to 34-year-old adults saying they are overweight, compared with 49% of 35- to 54-year-olds and 47% of adults aged 55 and older.\nMore Than Half of Americans Would Like to Lose Weight\nWhile 55% of U.S. adults say they would like to lose weight, 33% are content with maintaining their current weight and 11% want to gain weight. These readings have been fairly steady since 1996, when Gallup began to regularly track this measure. However, Gallup\u2019s earliest readings on this measure, taken between 1951 and 1957, were markedly different from today, as pluralities were content to remain at their current weight.\nWomen have historically outpaced men when it comes to wanting to slim down. The latest 61% of women who would like to lose weight compares to 48% of men, which is close to the average 15-point gap since 1951.\nThere are also differences on this measure by age, as adults under 35 (41%) are less likely than those aged 35 and older (59%) to express a desire to lose weight.\n27% of Americans Are Seriously Trying to Lose Weight\nAlthough 55% of U.S. adults express a desire to lose weight, only about half as many (27%) say they are seriously trying to do so. This includes 32% of women and 23% of men. Each of these readings tracks closely with the trend average since 1996.\nThirty percent of U.S. adults say they have lost a significant amount of weight in the past two years, including 4% who say they are taking a prescription drug that has contributed to their weight loss and 26% who say they are not. There is no difference in reports of significant weight loss among men and women.\nUse of Fitness Trackers Slightly Higher Than Five Years Ago\nAbout one-quarter of Americans each say they currently wear a fitness tracker such as a smartwatch or smart ring (24%) or track their health statistics using an app on their phone or tablet (26%). Use of these technologies to monitor health -- including the number of steps they take, how much sleep and exercise they get, and details about their personal health history -- is up from 19% five years ago.\nWhile 64% of U.S. adults are not currently utilizing either of these technologies, 16% use both, 8% only wear a fitness tracker and 10% are solely tracking their health statistics with an app.\nFitness trackers are most popular with adults aged 35 to 54 (32%), with fewer of their younger (21%) and older (19%) counterparts using them. Those who are seriously trying to lose weight are more likely than those who are not to say they wear a fitness tracker (30% vs. 21%, respectively). Yet, adults who consider themselves to be overweight are not much more likely than those who say their weight is about right to use trackers or health apps.\nMore than three-quarters of adults who use a fitness tracker (77%) say it is a helpful tool in reaching their health goals. Likewise, 82% of those who use an app to track their health statistics say it is helpful.\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download)."
