  "title": "Bruno Mars\u2019s Historic No. 1 Hit Is Back",
  "description": "Bruno Mars\u2019s 2013 piano ballad \u201cWhen I Was Your Man\u201d returns to both of Billboard's global charts, jointing \"Die with a Smile,\" \"Apt.,\" and \u201cJust the Way You Are.\"",
  "content": "More than a decade ago, Bruno Mars made history with his single \u201cWhen I Was Your Man.\u201d The track shot to No. 1 on the Hot 100 in the United States, becoming one of only a handful of cuts featuring nothing but piano and vocals to conquer the tally.\n\n12 years after its release, \u201cWhen I Was Your Man\u201d is a global hit once again, joining several other compositions by Mars on Billboard\u2019s worldwide rankings.\n\n\u201cWhen I Was Your Man\u201d Becomes a Global Smash Again\n\n\u201cWhen I Was Your Man\u201d reenters both the Billboard Global 200 and the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. The only difference between those two tallies is that streams and sales from American consumers are not factored into the latter. Mars\u2019s 2013 ballad reenters at No. 191 on the Global 200 and No. 195 on the Global Excl. U.S.\n\n\u201cWhen I Was Your Man\u201d May Soon Reach 100 Weeks\n\n\u201cWhen I Was Your Man\u201d is approaching 100 weeks on both rankings, though it likely won\u2019t reach that milestone on the two tallies at the same time. The ballad only needs two more frames on the Billboard Global 200 before it becomes another 100-frame winner for Mars. The track is up to 93 stays on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S.\n\nThis week, Mars fills five spaces on both charts. His collaboration with Lady Gaga, \u201cDie With a Smile,\u201d lives inside the top 10 on both tallies. His team-up with Blackpink\u2019s Ros\u00e9 holds at No. 8 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. and sits just beneath the top tier on the Global 200.\n\nMars\u2019s debut smash \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d improves on both tallies, while \u201cLocked Out of Heaven\u201d \u2014 which was featured on the same album as \u201cWhen I Was Your Man\u201d \u2014 declines by more than 10 spaces on the two lists.\n\n\u201cLocked Out of Heaven,\u201d \u201cTreasure\u201d and \u201cGorilla\u201d\n\nMars released \u201cWhen I Was Your Man\u201d in January 2013 as the second single from his sophomore album Unorthodox Jukebox. It followed fellow Hot 100 champion \u201cLocked Out of Heaven\u201d and preceded three more singles, \u201cTreasure,\u201d \u201cGorilla,\u201d and \u201cYoung Girls,\u201d which helped make the full-length another huge win for the singer-songwriter.",
