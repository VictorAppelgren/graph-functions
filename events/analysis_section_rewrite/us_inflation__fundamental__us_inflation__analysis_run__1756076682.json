      "feedback": "This draft admirably links AI-driven disruption to household finance and asset pricing, but it needs a true multi‑year, invariant framework and sharper structure. Actionable edits: (1) add explicit first‑principles anchors (e.g., productivity growth, real rate differentials, terms‑of‑trade/BOP dynamics, and policy‑reaction functions) and then articulate regimes and transition conditions (e.g., slow/fast AI adoption, policy spillovers, and credit/sovereign financing constraints) to ground the multi‑year view; (2) convert the causal chain into a clean, testable transmission: AI adoption → productivity/demand effects → household balance sheets and saving/investment behavior → durable cash‑flow assets and ROIC/WACC pricing → equity multiples and dividend total returns; (3) structure the scenario framework (base case, upside, downside) with explicit catalysts and invalidation triggers (AI uptake pace, UBI pilots outcomes, EV profitability trajectory, labor‑force responses) and quantify how these shift the base case; (4) anchor quantification to the numbers in sources (25% of US employment high automation exposure; >70% of tasks at risk; 15% self‑funded savings; Chanel‑quality durability; Ford’s 5.18% yield and ~8–10× forward P/E; Ford’s decade‑long 33% total return vs S&P ≈267% [as cited]; ROIC vs WACC in the ROIC literature) and consistently apply total return framing; (5) tighten the ROIC/valuation logic by using ROIC–WACC as a driver of long‑run premium/discount in sectors (as explained in the ROIC‑vs‑WACC piece and the total‑return piece); (6) reconcile conflicts explicitly (UBI trials show weak employment effects but potential psychological costs per NL5YYTLF2; EV profitability headwinds for Ford vs income yield signals per 22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW) and prune sources that don’t advance the causal chain (e.g., peripheral consumer‑goods lists); (7) deliver a crisp base‑case narrative with calibrated ranges drawn from sources (e.g., automation exposure, savings rate, ROIC vs WACC, EV losses, dividend yields) and a clear “what to watch” cadence; (8) align with SECTION FOCUS by having a clearly stated horizon, regime map, invariant anchors, a derived base case with risks and confidence, and a concise closing on expected pricing/quality signals; (9) present the citations after the relevant claims, ensuring every substantive point rests on one of the IDs (1GVYF2V8O; 2QRLB974F; NL5YYTLF2; 22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW; 4; 9) and avoid implying unsupported cross‑source certainties.",
