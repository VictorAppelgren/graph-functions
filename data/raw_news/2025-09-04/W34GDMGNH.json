  "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nIt will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Oct. 29. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post EPS of $5.05, down from $5.58 in the prior-year period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to be $8.97 billion, up from $8.50 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe 52-week range of Amgen stock price was $253.30 to $339.17.\n\nAmgen's dividend yield is 3.33%. It paid $9.52 per share in dividends during the last 12 months.\n\u2022 Your Last Chance to Invest in Pacaso Before Their Global Expansion \u2014 Offer Ends Sept 18\n\u2022 An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThe company on Aug. 5 announced its Q2 2025 earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $6.02, compared to the consensus estimate of $5.24, and revenues of $9.18 billion, compared to the consensus of $8.87 billion, as reported by Benzinga.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delivering strong performance and reaching more patients with innovative medicines and biosimilars that address serious diseases. We continue to invest in science that enables longer, healthier lives and supports sustainable, long-term growth,\u201d said CEO Robert A. Bradway.\n\nFor the full-year 2025, the company expects total revenues to be in the range of $35 billion to $36 billion.\n\nCheck out this article by Benzinga for nine analysts' insights on Amgen.\n\nTrending: Vacancy Rates Below 5% and $2.3B in Unmet Demand \u2014 How Everyday Investors Can Access America's Industrial Boom\n\nHow Can You Earn $100 Per Month As An Amgen Investor?\n\nIf you want to make $100 per month \u2014 $1,200 annually \u2014 from Amgen dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $36,036, which is around 125 shares at $287.71 each.\n\nUnderstanding the dividend yield calculations: When making an estimate, you need two key variables \u2014 the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (3.33% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.0333 = $36,036 to generate an income of $100 per month.\n\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock.\n\nThe dividend yield can change over time. This is the outcome of fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.\n\nSee Also: Bill Gates Says Climate Change \u2018Needs to Be Solved' \u2014 This Award-Winning Building Material Is Tackling It Head-On\n\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).",

As an investor in the company, you own a piece of the company and stand to benefit if the company grows in value, such as through an IPO or acquisition. Returns would come from the company\u2019s financial performance, including its revenue from home sales, property management, and financing services. If Pacaso becomes more successful, the value of your shares may increase, and you may be able to sell them for a profit during or after a liquidity event (like an IPO or acquisition).\nThis offering is open to everyone. Accredited and non-accredited investors within the U.S. are able to invest in Pacaso. Is there a minimum or maximum investment?\nThe minimum investment is $1,000.50, with no maximum.\nOur pre-money valuation for this round is approximately $914M. The share price was set based on financial modeling, company performance, and market opportunity and we believe it positions us well for long-term growth.\nA return on your investment would likely come through one of the following:\n- Initial Public Offering (IPO): If Pacaso goes public, investors may be able to sell their shares in the public market, potentially realizing a profit based on the company\u2019s market valuation.\n- Acquisition: If Pacaso is acquired by another company, investors may receive a return based on the terms of the acquisition deal, which could involve cash or stock in the acquiring company.\nThese potential events would provide opportunities for investors to realize returns, but they are contingent on the company's future performance and decisions. While an IPO is a potential future liquidity event, our current focus is on scaling the business and creating long-term value for our clients, and thus shareholders. Of course, we are always on the lookout for strategic opportunities that align with our growth and mission, and it is a goal of the company to be run as a public company. We want to ensure that any such event is beneficial for both our clients and our shareholders.\nPacaso makes money through several key revenue streams:\n- Home Sales: Pacaso earns money when it sells homes to co-owners.\n- Resale Transactions: If a co-owner decides to resell their shares of the property, we can help facilitate this sale and earn a commission similar to a realtor.\n- Property Management Fees: The company charges fees for managing and maintaining the homes, including tasks such as housekeeping, maintenance, and general property upkeep.\n- Financing Services: Pacaso offers financing options for potential co-owners, and earns revenue through interest or fees associated with those financing services.\nIn our fourth full year of operation, Pacaso has achieved over $100M in gross profits and facilitated $1B in gross real estate transactions and service fees across more than 40 markets nationwide, as well as internationally in Paris, London, and Cabo.\nIn 2024, we saw 16% YoY growth in gross real estate transacted and associated services fees, an 18% annual increase in adjusted gross profit, and a $6.4M improvement to EBITDA.\nPacaso will use funds from the growth round offering to expand our portfolio, adding homes in more destinations. For example, we\u2019ve already used funds from this raise to further expand into Paris. Additionally, we\u2019ll invest in product, engineering, and home operations, supporting our mission to help families create unforgettable memories and meaningful connections in luxury vacation residences. Most recently, we launched our global swap feature, allowing Pacaso home owners to swap stays with other Pacaso owners."
