  "description": "The EU\u2019s general court has given the third attempt at such an agreement the green light.",
  "content": "Europe\u2019s second-highest court has dismissed a challenge against between the European Union and the US. \"On the date of adoption of the contested decision, the United States of America ensured an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organisations in that country,\" the EU\u2019s General Court ruled ( ).\n\nThe two sides brokered the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework in 2023 to continue allowing US companies to store European users\u2019 personal data on Stateside servers. The pact included a proviso that allows for Europeans to file complaints over what US companies do with their data.\n\nFrench politician Philippe Latombe sued the European Commission (EC), the EU\u2019s executive arm and the body that struck the deal with the US, claiming that \"there were inadequate guarantees of respect for private and family life in the agreement because of the widespread and bulk collection of personal data,\" according to . He also said that the Data Protection Review Court (DPRC), the body that was set up to handle complaints from Europeans , wasn\u2019t an independent tribunal and didn\u2019t necessarily offer the level of protection required under European law.\n\nThe General Court determined that the DPRC\u2019s functioning and appointment of judges \"are accompanied by several safeguards and conditions to ensure the independence of its members.\" It stated that the judges can only be removed by the Attorney General and for cause, while the AG and intelligence agencies \"may not hinder or improperly influence their work.\"\n\nThe political landscape has shifted dramatically since the agreement was reached in 2023. The Trump administration has over independent government agencies and it\u2019s been at loggerheads with the EU over issues such as regulating major US-based tech companies and international trade. Still, the General Court points out that the EC is required to keep an eye on the application of the legal framework.\n\n\"If the legal framework in force in the United States at the time of the adoption of the contested decision changes, the Commission may decide, if necessary, to suspend, amend or repeal the contested decision or to limit its scope,\" the court said. The judges also dismissed Latombe's claims regarding the bulk collection of personal data.\n\nLatombe can still take the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Europe's top court previously scrapped two previous data transfer deals between the EU and US \u2014 the and the \u2014 following challenges by pro-privacy activist Max Schrems, who raised concerns about American intelligence agencies accessing the private data of European citizens.",

      "text": "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reins in Independent Agencies to Restore a Government that Answers to the American People\nRESTORING DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order ensuring that all federal agencies are accountable to the American people, as required by the Constitution. Under this Executive Order:\n- The Order notes that Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests all executive power in the President, meaning that all executive branch officials and employees are subject to his supervision.\n- Therefore, because all executive power is vested in the President, all agencies must: (1) submit draft regulations for White House review\u2014with no carve-out for so-called independent agencies, except for the monetary policy functions of the Federal Reserve; and (2) consult with the White House on their priorities and strategic plans, and the White House will set their performance standards.\n- The Office of Management and Budget will adjust so-called independent agencies\u2019 apportionments to ensure tax dollars are spent wisely.\n- The President and the Attorney General (subject to the President\u2019s supervision and control) will interpret the law for the executive branch, instead of having separate agencies adopt conflicting interpretations.\nREINING IN INDEPENDENT AGENCIES: So-called independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have exercised enormous power over the American people without Presidential oversight.\n- These agencies issue rules and regulations that cost billions of dollars and implicate some of the most controversial policy matters, and they do so without the review of the democratically elected President.\n- They also spend American tax dollars and set priorities without consulting the President, while setting their own performance standards.\n- Now they will no longer impose rules on the American people without oversight or accountability.\nENSURING A GOVERNMENT THAT ANSWERS TO THE PEOPLE: This order fulfills President Trump\u2019s promise to restore constitutional governance and accountability to the entire executive branch.\n- Executive power without responsibility has no place in our Republic. The United States was founded on the principle that the government should be accountable to the people. That is why the Founders created a single President who is alone vested with \u201cthe executive Power\u201d and responsibility to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\n- Voters and the President can now hold all Federal agencies\u2014not just Cabinet departments\u2014responsible for their decisions, as the Constitution demands."

      "text": "Biden signs executive order to protect personal data transfers between the US and EU\nThe framework is meant to guard against surveillance.\nMonths after reaching a deal, the White House has taken official steps to protect data transfers between the US and European Union. President Biden has signed an executive order directing the government's efforts to implement the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. The approach mainly requires that intelligence agencies \"take into consideration\" privacy and civil liberties before seeking data, and only conduct surveillance when there's a clearly defined need to address national security concerns.\nIntelligence gatherers will also need to update their policies on elements like data handling, with reviews keeping them in line. There will also be a \"multi-layer\" review process for EU residents' privacy violation complaints. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) will investigate possible lawbreaking through its civil liberties officer, while the Attorney General will use a new Data Protection Review Court to review the results of those investigations and make binding rulings.\nThe Data Privacy Framework is a response to the EU Court of Justice striking down the Privacy Shield agreement in 2020. The court found that the pact gave the US too much leeway to surveil EU data, and wasn't consistent with privacy requirements effectively equal to European law. The US balked at this rejection, arguing that it cast doubt on companies' ability to legally transfer data.\nThe European Commission will still need to examine the framework to determine if it offers enough protection. Between this and law enforcement-oriented agreements with countries like Australia and the UK, though, the US is quickly firming up its approach to international data sharing \u2014 albeit with concerns that spies might still have too much power."

      "text": "Europe's top court kills Privacy Shield that allowed US data sharing\nIt said the law won't protect EU citizens from mass US surveillance.\nThe EU just threw a wrench into transatlantic e-commerce by blocking a key agreement between Europe and the US. Europe\u2019s top court announced that it has effectively invalidated the Privacy Shield that just went into force, saying it won\u2019t adequately protect EU citizens from mass US surveillance.\n\u201cThe limitations on the protection of personal data arising from the domestic law of the United States... are not circumscribed in a way that satisfies requirements that are essentially equivalent to those required under EU law,\u201d the court wrote. Put more succinctly, the law wouldn\u2019t work because the US allows mass surveillance while the EU favors personal privacy.\nThe decision affects thousands of companies doing business in Europe, ranging from banks to social media companies like Facebook. They may have to either set up European data hubs or stop doing business in the bloc altogether, pending any renegotiation. However, the ruling only applies to specific types of data and won\u2019t affect \u201cnecessary\u201d data transfers like emails, vacation bookings and news site access.\nUS commerce secretary Wilbur Ross gave a statement saying, in essence, that the US will study the ruling but is simply going to ignore it for now.\nWe have been and will remain in close contact with the European Commission and European Data Protection Board on this matter and hope to be able to limit the negative consequences to the $7.1 trillion transatlantic economic relationship. The Department of Commerce will continue to administer the Privacy Shield program, including processing submissions for self-certification and re-certification to the Privacy Shield Frameworks and maintaining the Privacy Shield List. Today\u2019s decision does not relieve participating organizations of their Privacy Shield obligations.\nThe decision was not a huge surprise, as many players felt the new privacy shield was full of holes that could easily be attacked in court. In Europe, privacy activists see the ruling as a victory. It\u2019s known as Schrems II after EU lawyer Max Schrems who helped kill the previous EU/US arrangement known as Safe Harbor, and Schrems himself weighed in.\n\u201cIt is clear that the US will have to seriously change their surveillance laws, if US companies want to continue to play a major role on the EU market,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the EU will not change its fundamental rights to please the NSA, the only way to overcome this clash is for the US to introduce solid privacy rights for all people \u2013 including foreigners. Surveillance reform thereby becomes crucial for the business interests of Silicon Valley.\u201d\nBusinesses, understandably, aren\u2019t so happy. \u201cThis decision creates legal uncertainty for the thousands of large and small companies on both sides of the Atlantic that rely on Privacy Shield for their daily commercial data transfers,\u201d said Alexandre Roure from the CCIA tech lobby group. \u201cWe trust that EU and US decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the transatlantic economy.\u201d"

      "text": "New privacy deal allows US tech giants to continue storing European user data on American servers\nThe Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework gives Europeans a way to file a complaint about what US firms do with their data.\nNearly three years after a 2020 court decision threatened to grind transatlantic e-commerce to a halt, the European Union has adopted a plan that will allow US tech giants to continue storing data about European users on American soil. In a decision announced Monday, the European Commission approved the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. Under the terms of the deal, the US will establish a court Europeans can engage with if they feel a US tech platform violated their data privacy rights. President Joe Biden announced the creation of the Data Protection Review Court in an executive order he signed last fall. The court can order the deletion of user data and impose other remedial measures. The framework also limits access to European user data by US intelligence agencies.\nThe Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework is the latest chapter in a saga that is now more than a decade in the making. It was only earlier this year the EU fined Meta a record-breaking \u20ac1.2 billion after it found that Facebook's practice of moving EU user data to US servers violated the bloc's digital privacy laws. The EU also ordered Meta to delete the data it already had stored on its US servers if the company didn't have a legal way to keep that information there by the fall. As The Wall Street Journal notes, Monday's agreement should allow Meta to avoid the need to delete any data, but the company may end up still paying the fine.\nEven with a new agreement in place, it probably won't be smooth sailing just yet for the companies that depend the most on cross-border data flows. Max Schrems, the lawyer who successfully challenged the previous Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield agreements that governed transatlantic data transfers before today, told The Journal he plans to challenge the new framework. \"We would need changes in US surveillance law to make this work and we simply don't have it,\" he said. For what it's worth, the European Commission says it's confident it can defend its new framework in court.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "EU rules that US companies can't freely pull data out of Europe\nA legal framework used to justify the movement of user data across the Atlantic has just been ruled invalid by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The Safe Harbor agreement, as it's known, let companies like Facebook and Twitter freely move your information between its centers in Europe and the US. However, following today's judgement, they may now need to store those details locally or prove that European privacy standards designed to protect your rights are being upheld.\nThe case began when Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems called out Facebook's desire to move data stored in its Irish data center over to the US following Edward Snowden's NSA surveillance leaks. The Irish courts dismissed the action citing the Safe Habor agreement, leaving him to lodge an appeal with the European Court of Justice. While he waited for a decision, Schrems received backing from Yves Bot, Advocate General of the ECJ, who agreed that Safe Harbor was dangerous and not binding.\nWith all past data-sharing agreements now deemed invalid, individual regulators now have the power to decide what happens with data stored in their countries. Ireland, for example, must now \"examine, with complete independence, whether the transfer of a person's data to a third country complies with the requirements laid down by the directive.\"\n\"Legislation permitting the public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life,\" the court adds.\nWhat must companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter do now? It's not yet known how this will affect the flow of data between countries, but we do know that authorities can question the need for such a process and possibly request that all user data is stored locally, rather than in the US. More than 4,000 European and American companies are affected, so it's not a small judgement. However, the European Union and the US are in negotiations over a new agreement, one that could give Europe far more control over what companies, but also security agencies, have access to.\n[Image credit: mpd01605, Flickr]"
