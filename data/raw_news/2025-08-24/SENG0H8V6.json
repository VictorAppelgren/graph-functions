  "title": "Is BASF SE (ETR:BAS) Trading At A 27% Discount?",
  "description": "Key Insights BASF's estimated fair value is \u20ac65.69 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity BASF is estimated to be...",
  "content": "\u2022 BASF's estimated fair value is \u20ac65.69 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 BASF is estimated to be 27% undervalued based on current share price of \u20ac48.06\n\u2022 Analyst price target for BAS is \u20ac49.88 which is 24% below our fair value estimate How far off is BASF SE (ETR:BAS) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality. We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = \u20ac23b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= \u20ac64b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.2%)10= \u20ac35b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is \u20ac59b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of \u20ac48.1, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at BASF as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.132. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\u2022 Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\u2022 Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the German market.\n\u2022 Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\u2022 Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\u2022 Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the German market. Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For BASF, we've put together three fundamental aspects you should assess:\n\u2022 Risks: Case in point, we've spotted 3 warning signs for BASF you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does BAS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

  "argos_summary": "BASF SE is considered undervalued, with a discounted\u2011cash\u2011flow fair value of \u20ac65.69 versus the current share price of \u20ac48.06, a 27% discount. The DCF model uses a two\u2011stage growth forecast and a 6.2% discount rate, yielding a total equity value of \u20ac59\u202fbillion. Analysts maintain a 12\u2011month target of \u20ac49.88, still below the fair value estimate, while the company\u2019s high PE ratio (110.6x) indicates it trades at a premium to peers. Overall, BASF\u2019s strong balance sheet, dividend position and earnings growth prospects support its undervaluation relative to market and analyst expectations.",
