  "description": "A volunteer group aimed at restoring the site has disbanded after funding failed to materialise.",
  "content": "'No hope' for windmill as volunteer group disbands\n\nA volunteer group which had spent years campaigning for funding towards the restoration of a Lincolnshire windmill has disbanded after the \"fight for its future was futile\". Doug Robinson from the Alford Windmill Trust said he had experienced a \"difficult and challenging\" few months after \u00a31.2m of government funding was withdrawn by East Lindsey District Council (ELDC). Councillor Graham Marsh from ELDC said some money was still available to fund the outbuildings at the site but the authority needed \"a level of guarantee\" the county council would fund the repairs of the windmill. Lincolnshire County Council (LCC) said it was looking at \"different options\" for the windmills it owns.\n\nAccording to Mr Robinson, the windmill trust started four years ago and aimed to manage the windmill and outbuildings as a \"thriving tourist attraction\". ELDC had promised money for a new caf\u00e9, visitor centre and shop after the authority successfully received \u00a31.2m of levelling up funding. The money had been allocated from an \u00a38m government grant for the Lincolnshire Wolds Culture and Heritage Programme. In December 2024 funding was withdrawn by ELDC. District Councillor Graham Marsh said funding was reallocated to Alford Manor House as the grant had to be spent by September 2026. Marsh said it became \"quite clear\" restoration work for the outbuildings at the site could not be completed in time. According to Marsh, \u00a3800,000 was still available to fund work on the outbuildings but the district council needed \"level of guarantee\" of funding from Lincolnshire County Council to repair the windmill. \"Without a working windmill there, there is no prospect of that being a viable site,\" he said. In a joint statement, Councillor Natalie Oliver, LCC's portfolio holder for culture, and Councillor Liam Kelly, the authority's portfolio holder for property, said: \"As a new leadership team, we've come into the council with a fresh pair of eyes and have asked officers to present the different options and costs associated with the various windmills owned by the county council. \"Protecting our heritage assets is important, as is making sure we are using taxpayers' money to the best effect. We'll be considering the options for windmills at a meeting later in the year.\"\n\nMr Robinson said the trust had explored \"every avenue\". \"We've got to a stage that we can do no more,\" he said. \"There's no funding, there seems to be no hope.\" Mr Robinson said although the trust had disbanded, their doors were still open. \"Alford is about the windmill, everyone talks about the windmill,\" he said. \"We just hope the councils will come back to us with really good news.\" Listen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

      "text": "Volunteers 'devastated' as windmill funding pulled\n- Published\nVolunteers say they are \"absolutely devastated\" by a decision to withdraw \u00a31.2m of funding from a windmill restoration project.\nEast Lindsey District Council (ELDC) had promised the money for a new cafe, visitor centre and shop at Alford Windmill.\nBut the councillor in charge of the project said ELDC had \"little choice but to pause the scheme\" because the owners of the windmill, Lincolnshire County Council (LCC), had no \"commitment to restore\" the mill itself.\nLCC said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision, but its \"hands are tied slightly on timescales\".\nThe money had been allocated from an \u00a38m government grant for the Lincolnshire Wolds Culture and Heritage Programme.\nELDC previously said the plans would help to secure the future of the windmill. But the council has now \"agreed to reallocate the money\".\nDoug Porter-Robinson, of the Alford Windmill Trust, which has been hoping to manage the windmill and outbuildings as a visitor attraction, said the \"devastating\" news followed \"delay after delay\".\n\"We're so disappointed,\" he added. \"We just look at each other wondering what we're going to do now.\n\"It's just a catastrophic mistake. The people who will lose out are the people of Alford.\"\nELDC said the government funding had to be used by March 2026. It had \"been left with little choice but to look again\" at how to use the money.\nCouncillor Graham Marsh, the deputy leader of ELDC, said the mill was \"the anchor for this whole project\".\n\"Without a working mill \u2013 and a commitment to restore it from the owners \u2013 the whole site has no main attraction,\" he added.\nRemaining funds will now go towards the Alford Manor project, where a new function room and other improvements are planned, amid hopes that more funding for the windmill will be found.\nMarsh claimed the deterioration of the mill meant \"the projected cost of the repair is \u00a31.2m\".\nCouncillor Richard Butroid, executive member for corporate property at LCC, said: \"We have recognised additional inflationary costs, but this does not diminish our disappointment that East Lindsey have withdrawn their funding for Alford Windmill.\"\n\"Nevertheless, the \u00a3460,000 we have allocated to the project remains committed, as well as our intention to repair the building.\"\nMr Porter-Robinson said: \"It baffles me that Lincolnshire County Council and East Lindsey District Council haven't worked in harmony on this project.\n\"We've been spectators all the way through this until the funding has now been pulled.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external."

Choose topics from a staggeringly comprehensive list, and suddenly you\u2019re getting just the stories that truly matter to you. It makes the challenge of keeping up with the world almost manageable.\nGo Forward or Backward\nSorry but the previous version was better than this latest revision. Now there is so much news available but not properly categorised or is out of date, you can be forgiven to miss something important. It also wastes time - reviewing old items that certainly should not appear on \u201cMy News\u201d. It may have a categorised place though.... How about a category for \u201cold news\u201d or \u201c Updates\u201d\nTo help with all of this, it would be good if at the end of each item, both in picture format or detailed text, you add the date and time the item was first broadcast. You can also add an update date / time, but keep you first broadcast date / time as well. The date / time of your informative news incidents is important to everyone so this is a very worthy consideration.\nThank you for reading and considering this.\nNot all updates are improvements\nI have had to downgrade this latest version 7.0.0 It\u2019s really not doing it for me, I preferred the old version where you had swipe right to different topics, this scrolling one is terrible, and doesn\u2019t seem to show as many topics, and fresh news is less than it was, The only thing I find I want to scroll is back to the previous Version, still I suppose these app developers have to keep themselves looking busy 2 / 5 and that\u2019s being generous.\nUpdate: Further downgrade to 1 Star, seems the app has a Share function, so you can share news on Facebook etc\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t actually work, you press Share, and select Facebook, it appears to perform a curtsy and that\u2019s it, so it is awkward to use and lacks functionality, don\u2019t know why they did this, the previous version was much better. Pointless\nUpdated Update, well the latest version seems to have fixed the curtsy and I can now share news as a post on Facebook, but sadly the layout is still not improving any, but back up to 2 Stars, I wish they\u2019d go back to the previous sideways scroll, I really can\u2019t find any interest in the vertical scroll.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, BBC Media Applications Technologies Limited, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

  "argos_summary": "The Alford Windmill Trust has disbanded after years of campaigning for funding to restore a Lincolnshire windmill, following the withdrawal of \u00a31.2 million in government funding by East Lindsey District Council. Despite some remaining funds for outbuildings, the council requires assurance from Lincolnshire County Council for windmill repairs, which has led to a bleak outlook for the site's future. Local councils are exploring options to support the windmill's restoration, but the trust's disbandment reflects the challenges faced in securing necessary funding.",
