  "content": "Former head coach Jon Gruden is \u201clooking forward\u201d to the \u201ctruth\u201d coming out over his allegations that the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell had leaked disparaging emails that Gruden had sent before his resignation as head coach of the Raiders in 2021.\n\nIn a statement to ESPN, less than 24 hours after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled in his favor to prevent the league from forcing Gruden\u2019s suit into a closed-door arbitration, the Super Bowl-winning coach reiterated his claim that the league had a hand in the whole situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to having the truth come out, and I want to make sure what happened to me doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else,\u201d Gruden said.\n\n\u201cThe league\u2019s actions disrupted the whole season,\u201d Gruden added. \u201cWe were leading the division at the time, and they completely blindsided me and the team.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened wasn\u2019t right and I\u2019m glad the court didn\u2019t let the NFL cover it up,\u201d he added in his statement.\n\nThe emails in question were published by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times in October 2021 and showed Gruden using racist, sexist and anti-gay language in messages sent to then-Commanders general manager Bruce Allen in the years before Gruden\u2019s coaching tenure in Las Vegas.\n\nThe emails came up during the NFL\u2019s inquiry into the Commanders\u2019 toxic work environment, and Gruden claims they were leaked to force him to resign as head coach of the Raiders, something he eventually did.\n\nESPN reported the league will next petition the Nevada Supreme Court for a rehearing. If that fails, the NFL would then appeal to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe Nevada Supreme Court ruled in Gruden\u2019s favor in a 5-2 decision, but the court did not determine the merits of Gruden\u2019s legal claims, only making the call on the NFL\u2019s attempt to push the case into a private arbitration.",

      "text": "Jon Gruden said Tuesday that he is eager to discover the truth in a Nevada courtroom about whether commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL leaked emails to the media before Gruden was forced to resign as Raiders head coach in 2021.\n\"I'm looking forward to having the truth come out and I want to make sure what happened to me doesn't happen to anyone else,\" he said in a statement provided to ESPN.\nGruden said he blames the NFL for leaking the emails, which led the league to pressure the Raiders to force him out when the team was 3-1.\n\"The league's actions disrupted the whole season,\" Gruden said. \"We were leading the division at the time, and they completely blindsided me and the team.\"\nHe added, \"What happened wasn't right and I'm glad the court didn't let the NFL cover it up.\"\nGruden's comments came a day after the Nevada Supreme Court sided with him in his lawsuit alleging the NFL leaked damaging emails to the media before he was forced to resign in October 2021.\nIn a 5-2 ruling, the justices did not determine whether the league had leaked Gruden's racist, sexist and anti-gay emails to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times at the time. But they found the league's decision to force Gruden's complaint into closed-door arbitration proceedings overseen by Goodell -- the target of Gruden's civil lawsuit -- was \"unconscionable.\"\nAn NFL spokesperson said Tuesday that the league would petition the Nevada Supreme Court for a rehearing. If that fails, the most likely next venue will be an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nNeither Gruden, nor his lawyer, Adam Hosmer-Henner, would say whether they were inclined to settle the case with the NFL.\nGruden declined to address his coaching future Tuesday. He said last week that he was eager to return to coaching and added: \"I'd die to coach in the SEC.\"\nHosmer-Henner said he was gratified that the Nevada Supreme Court blocked Goodell from overseeing an arbitration proceeding when he is a defendant in a lawsuit.\n\"The NFL's legal position is absurd and will continue to be rejected by every court,\" Hosmer-Henner told ESPN. \"Obviously, the NFL should not be allowed to be the judge of claims against the NFL or force people to comply with contracts that the NFL can unilaterally change any time it wants without notice.\"\nThe five justices of the Nevada Supreme Court ruled Monday that as a former employee, Gruden should not have been bound by an NFL constitution provision mandating arbitration for such complaints. Gruden's leaked emails were sent in 2011 while he was working for ESPN as a \"Monday Night Football\" analyst.\n\"By its own unambiguous language, the NFL Constitution no longer applies to Gruden,\" the five justices wrote. \"If the NFL Constitution were to bind former employees, the Commissioner could essentially pick and choose which disputes to arbitrate.\"\nOn Monday, Hosmer-Henner lauded the Nevada Supreme Court decision, saying it was a victory not just for Gruden but for all employees facing \"an employer's unfair arbitration process.\"\n\"This victory further vindicates Coach Gruden's reputation, and it clears the way to swiftly bringing him full justice and holding the NFL accountable,\" Hosmer-Henner said.\nGruden's lawsuit alleges that Goodell and the league pressured Raiders owner Mark Davis to fire the coach by leaking emails containing offensive comments that Gruden sent about the commissioner and others in the NFL. Gruden resigned from the Raiders in October 2021.\nGruden won at the district court level. The NFL appealed to Nevada's high court after a state judge in Las Vegas in May 2022 rejected league bids to dismiss Gruden's claim outright or to order out-of-court settlement talks that could be overseen by Goodell.\nA year ago, a three-judge panel of the Nevada Supreme Court decided the league could move Gruden's civil case into arbitration that might be overseen by Goodell. Two justices said Gruden knew when he signed a 10-year contract with the Raiders in 2018 that the NFL used arbitration to resolve disputes. The dissenting justice wrote that it would be \"outrageous\" for Goodell to arbitrate a dispute in which he is named as a defendant.\nGruden's lawyers were granted an en banc hearing of all seven Nevada Supreme Court justices, who heard oral arguments last year. All four justices who heard the case for the first time sided with Gruden against the NFL."

      "text": "Jon Gruden came up with a big win in his ongoing legal battle with the NFL on Monday.\nThe Nevada Supreme Court ruled in Gruden\u2019s favor \u2013 a 5-2 decision \u2013 that his lawsuit against the league cannot be sent into arbitration, allowing the case to proceed in public.\nGruden had first sued the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell in 2021, claiming that the NFL had deliberately leaked disparaging emails that the ex-football coach had written in a \u201cmalicious and orchestrated campaign\u201d in order to \u201cdestroy the career and reputation\u201d of Gruden.\nThe seven-judge panel declared that the arbitration clause in the NFL\u2019s constitution \u201cis unconscionable and does not apply to Gruden as a former employee.\u201d\n\u201cThe NFL Constitution would allow Goodell, as Commissioner, to arbitrate disputes about his own conduct \u2014 exactly what is at issue here,\u201d the decision stated. \u201cThe ability of the stronger party to select a biased arbitrator is unconscionable, even if the stronger party may ultimately choose a neutral arbitrator.\u201d\nIt was later added that it was \u201cunconscionable\u201d that the NFL could change parts of its constitution \u201cat any time, and without notice,\u201d which included the arbitration clause.\nIn a statement to USA Today, Gruden\u2019s attorney, Adam Hosmer-Henner, said that they were \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the decision.\n\u201cThis victory further vindicates Coach Gruden\u2019s reputation, and it clears the way to swiftly bringing him full justice and holding the NFL accountable,\u201d he said.\nThe NFL has not publicly commented on the decision.\nThe decision did not make any determination about whether any of Gruden\u2019s claims were true.\nThe suit stems back to email leaks that came out while the NFL was investigating the Commanders\u2019 toxic workplace.\nThe leaked emails had included racist, misogynistic and anti-gay slurs and were sent by Gruden during his time as an ESPN analyst and sent to then-Commanders general manager Bruce Allen over the course of a seven-year period.\nWhen the emails leaked, Gruden had been the head coach of the Raiders and eventually resigned.\nA lower-level state court had initially rejected the NFL\u2019s attempt to dismiss the suit or force the two sides into a private arbitration, but the Nevada Supreme Court then ruled in the league\u2019s favor in May 2024 to dismiss the case, in a 2-1 decision.\nThe Nevada Supreme Court did grant a motion by Gruden\u2019s lawyers in October 2024 to have the case heard by the full court before ultimately ruling in his favor on Monday."

It was really nice to meet ya \ud83e\udd1d Never take for granted that many of my best friends are the ones I met in elementary school,\u201d Balionis, 39, captioned the Saturday post. \u201cTo take this trip with them\u2026 well I think 5th grade us would be really proud of how far we\u2019ve come, and that we continue to choose to do it together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f also shoutout to the guys for marrying the most fun partners \ud83e\udee1.\u201d\nBalionis looked stunning in a white bikini as she enjoyed a coconut cocktail under the sun.\nOther images spotlighted group dinners, sightseeing and partying in fluorescent-lit clubs.\nBalionis took some well-deserved time off after 19 weeks on the road with \u201cGolf on CBS.\u201d\nLast week, she shared a tribute to her broadcast team, including photos from the season.\n\u201cHard to put into words what 19 weeks on the road really looks like,\u201d Balionis wrote. \u201cFor us announcers, we have it easy \u2014 we show up to work with hotel rooms already booked, everything we need waiting at check-in.

      "text": "Jon Gruden \u2018ashamed\u2019 of vulgar emails, hoping to get \u2018another shot\u2019 at coaching\nJon Gruden addressed the homophobic and misogynist language he used in the emails that abruptly ended his tenure as Las Vegas Raiders coach in one of his first public remarks about the topic.\nThe 59-year-old Super Bowl winner called the emails \u201cshameful\u201d and asked for forgiveness for his actions during an appearance at Arkansas football\u2019s Little Rock Touchdown Club on Tuesday.\n\u201cI\u2019m ashamed about what has come about in these emails, and I\u2019ll make no excuses for it. It\u2019s shameful,\u201d Gruden said in a video from KATV sportscaster Steve Sullivan. \u201cBut I am a good person. I believe that. I go to church. I\u2019ve been married for 31 years. I\u2019ve got three great boys. I still love football. I\u2019ve made some mistakes, but I don\u2019t think anybody in here hasn\u2019t. I just ask for forgiveness, and hopefully I get another shot.\u201d\nGruden, who resigned as Raiders coach last October, is currently involved a lawsuit with the NFL that claims the league intentionally leaked the emails to the media, so he was unable to go into greater detail on the matter. The correspondences, which were part of the league\u2019s investigation into the Washington Commanders\u2019 toxic work culture, were written between 2011-18 when Gruden was working as a \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d analyst for ESPN.\nIn them Gruden made anti-gay remarks about NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and the openly gay Michael Sam, a seventh-round pick of the Rams in 2014, and made racist comments toward NFLPA director DeMaurice Smith, who is black.\nDuring the appearance, Gruden then turned critical of his former employer ESPN for how he felt it covered his story and others in an attempt for ratings.\n\u201cI get choked up because there\u2019s a lot of misunderstanding out there right now,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWhat you read, what you hear, what you watch on TV. Hell, I worked at ESPN for nine years\u2014I worked hard at that job. I don\u2019t even want to watch the channel anymore because I don\u2019t believe everything is true. And I know a lot of it is just trying to get people to watch.\u201d\nGruden signed a 10-year, $100 million contract with the Raiders in 2018 and ended up agreeing to a settlement with the team as he was owed at least $40 million in guaranteed money at the time of his departure."
