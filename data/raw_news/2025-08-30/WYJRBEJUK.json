  "content": "Re: \u201cWA needs new rule to cool down waterways for salmon, orcas, more\u201d (Aug. 14, Opinion) and \u201cForest & Fish Law: Yes to expanded forest buffer\u201d (Aug. 24, Opinion):\n\nI am responding to proponents of a proposed change in the Forest & Fish Law that would extend requirements for buffer strips to tiny feeder streams that don\u2019t provide fish habitat.\n\nKeeping water cool in summer is important to salmon, but so is food. Historically, our forests were more of a mix of hardwoods and conifers than they are today. Broad-leaf deciduous trees like alders, big leaf maple and cottonwoods not only provide shade but also nutrients in the form of leaf drop in the fall, which is the basis for much aquatic insect life.\n\nDue to past forest management practices and fire suppression, the forests along most streams today are dominated by conifers like Douglas firs. A smart management strategy would cut out many of the conifer trees, making room for hardwoods. Yes, for a few years stream temperatures would be warmer, but the long-term benefits would be to have more productive water due to the contribution of fall leaves. Moreover, during the cold months fish actually benefit from sunlight penetrating the canopy, as water is too cold for optimal growth.\n\nBuffer strips prevent forest managers from shaping the best habitats for fish.",

      "text": "Re: \u201cPro/Con: Changes to Forest & Fish Law\u201d (Aug. 14, Opinion):\nI would wholeheartedly agree with the timber industry that the 1999 Forest & Fish Law is perfectly adequate \u2026 if it were not for the fact that our climate is changing. Disregarding the science of climate change threatens our current and future forests and the important services they provide, such as clean water and air, habitats, wood products, etc. So yes, our forest practices must constantly evolve to maintain a resilient forest ecosystem and protect our watersheds.\nBy the 2040s, 40 miles of the Nooksack River Basin in Whatcom County will exceed the thermal tolerance of adult salmon. Summer stream flows will also decline over the next few decades. A forest buffer shading these mainly high-elevation feeder streams will help maintain cooler temperatures and slow evapotranspiration \u2014 clearly, a science-based and commonsense update to Forest & Fish Law.\nWashington is the second highest exporter of lumber in the U.S. and our state is the largest exporter of raw logs. Wood products are a critical renewable resource and I support a sustainable timber industry. However, what does a sustainable timber industry look like under climate change? Can our forest-dependent communities survive if we ignore climate change? These are questions we must address.\nEllyn Murphy, Bellingham"

      "text": "When salmon thrive, we all thrive. Sounds simple, but it\u2019s easy to forget that the fish that are the Pacific Northwest\u2019s economic, cultural and ecological touchstone need the same things we do: clean water, clean air, healthy forests. And of all these things, for salmon, the greatest is clean, cool water.\nRight now, a straightforward rule is on the table that would protect salmon by requiring a wider, 75-foot forested buffer along a subset of streams in the forested landscape in Western Washington classified by the Department of Natural Resources as \u201cType Np.\u201d There are over 19,000 miles of these streams in Western Washington.\nThese streams are largely high up in the mountains, run year-round and don\u2019t contain fish. Yet these waterways play an essential role in supporting fish habitat downstream. Protecting them protects everything downstream: salmon, ecosystems, wetlands, orca and more.\nWhat would be the benefits of these 75-foot buffers? These stretches of retained forest filter sediments and stabilize soils. They also provide shade that keeps water cold, which is necessary both for salmon and for healthy ecosystems. These buffers would also support forest microclimates that help make our state more resilient in the face of climate change.\nLandowners are trying to stop this rule to protect profits.\nThe science is clear: For decades, protection of these types of streams has been too weak, letting timber companies benefit while the public subsidized the costs of degraded water and ecosystems. The new logging restrictions will impact less than 1% of all forests in Western Washington. The state\u2019s cost-benefit analysis estimated that this rule would result in an annualized loss of $11 million to $35 million in forestland values statewide. This anticipated decrease in corporate profits is a small fraction of the $36 billion of annual timber revenues in Washington.\nThe benefits far outweigh this cost: habitat for salmon, amphibians and terrestrial wildlife; strong fisheries; increased carbon storage; and tribal cultural value. On the other hand, the cost of business as usual to the public and our cultural resources would be incalculable.\nIndustry\u2019s campaign to block this rule also undermines Washington\u2019s cooperative, science-based approach to forest policy, designed to replace the winner-takes-all lawsuits of the Timber Wars era.\nThe state\u2019s Adaptive Management Program brings together landowners and industry, tribes, state agencies, counties and conservation groups. Together, these groups identify information needs, conduct research and develop new rules based on the results.\nWashington Conservation Action has been part of this work from the very beginning. We were a signatory to the 1987 agreement that led to the AMP, with the goal of establishing science-based buffers protecting riparian habitat. Today, we lead the Conservation Caucus of the AMP, which is still seeking this protection alongside our partners within the program.\nThe rule now being debated reflects nearly two decades of scientific research, adaptive management, compromise and negotiation. The timber industry was a full participant in that work. Timber interests helped shape the studies and approved the results.\nBut without strong public support, the rule could still fail.\nThat would be catastrophic for fish and all the watersheds in Western Washington \u2014 another blow to already struggling salmon populations and the orca that depend upon them. It also would show that timber and landowners were only serious about shared stewardship of our state\u2019s wildlife and ecosystems when it didn\u2019t affect their bottom line.\nThis rule making is unfolding while the national safeguards for public lands and waterways are under pressure. This makes state action more important than ever. Washington can lead by adopting strong, science-based rules that reflect our values and that protect what matters most.\nThis is the moment to fulfill a 30-year promise made when our state\u2019s Forests & Fish law passed in 1999: To update the rules when the science shows a need. Formal public comment on the proposed rule for Type Np streams closed Aug. 12. But you can still ask our leaders to do what\u2019s right for our state and finalize this important rule that protects people and nature as one.

Timber companies oppose the rule, citing profit losses, while conservation groups emphasize the rule\u2019s role in climate resilience and habitat protection.
